Earningswhispers.com had projected 92 cents earnings with $616.39 M in revenues. RMD beat both of these numbers at 95 cents and $523.6 M.
Another 52 week high! Fantastic growth stock. Added a few more shares. Long term holder!
RMD reached an all time high at 138.80
They won the patent infringement case and the stock doesn't go up?
I bought at 177 and it's still moving down rapidly. It's unreal.
What is Mobi??
um...why aren't we moving?
RMD is up 4.95% to $103.38
Way oversold!
After hours +$1.2.
Almost back to the 52 week high!
"0107 GMT - ResMed beat 4Q consensus revenue forecasts almost entirely due to the performance of device sales outside the U.S., Goldman Sachs says. The investment bank says strong ventilator demand drove 35% growth in non-U.S. device sales, compared with consensus expectations for a 3% rise. GS notes overall mask-sales growth remained positive, but missed expectations in the U.S. and in the rest of the world. U.S. demand for ResMed sleep devices fell, with Goldman Sachs estimating about 80% of the decline was due to fewer new patients. The bank rates ResMed at buy with a A$30.20 target price. Shares fall 4.3% to A$26.76."
My daughter reserched the hell out of this stock. I held back buying until today. She thinks it is going to $120 by year end.
Hoping that this starts seeing some strong green next week.
"Wish I bought this years ago. I use their products (CPAP) and I can say this is a growing industry as BB Gen is and Gen X are using these products more and more. Other ResM products will only be in higher demand in Homes, Hospitals, Clinics..... Only real concern is competition nad copy cat manufacturers."
just curious why does it not show instantaneous quote. It's like every 5 minutes it will show a change in movement. Thank you
Beat on earnings. Why the drop?
"Going back to $110+ by March, great growth year over year. Long term holder. JMO"
"love the strength, red market, green stock"
Short?
It is strange how this stock jumps up after hours everyday
wow...really?
"NY Times reports:""Here’s the Biggest Thing to Worry About With the VirusWe don’t have enough ventilators and I.C.U. beds if there’s a significant surge of new cases. As with Italy, the health system could become overwhelmed"".One might expect this stock to ramp up, no?"
ResMed reached an all time high at 179.80
CEO on Fox Business just prior to market close on Tuesday.https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6180262667001/#sp=show-clips
"Seems the entire board of Resmed is dumping their shares. I am sure this is what is thanking the stock. Not sure what they are thinking or what they know. 55+ thousands shares already....sold by the board members Feb and March. Could be wrong on this but,Wait till $65 per share to buy back in for those holding long. It is obvious share holders holding the stick get spanked. Keep eyes on PHG. My opinion: way better long term. No insider sales. BTW I would have sold some shares in Resmed if I owned them. I was merely a spectator while they rose to the top at 150 levels. Well done Resmed team. Now be the first to lobby the need for mainstream O2 without prescription. It's about time."
what was earnings report. Why not up 10%???
Well are you all happy? POTUS just said at task force RMD one of the suppliers of ventilators
Poised for some good action this week!
Still very very happy and bullish here.
the 'sleeping' giant.
I have a CPAP from Resmed. It’s a superior product.
"Gee, it would be great if some shareholders would post their opinion once and a while!"
jumped in
"On yahoo finance, the consensus was 95 cents and they reported 95 cents. The revenue consensus was $623.2 M and the reported was $623.6 M. S theu beat on revenue and tied on earnings."
"Goldman did NOT ""estimate 80% decline in new patients"". This is pure FUD - just don't want people fooled. OTOH I can't believe GS change in rating from buy to neutral can drop a stock 14% in one day. A lot of profit-taking and automatic HFT's here. It's a strong company and it's growing. I'm in at 175 so we'll see. Good luck to longs!"

Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has flooded hospitals worldwide with patients struggling to breathe."""
ResMed downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Goldman Sachs. But I think it dropped more than enough today.
"Well, I can honestly say I've had better days. Hung in and looking for better days to come. GLTA"
It looks to me as their are mostly one charges for this quarter like the $200 mill7 million plus to settle the tax dispute with Australia. The market is way overreacting. The price should not drop this much. It will go back up in my opinion.
ResMed reached an all time high at 185.74
how do you buy stock through this yahoo finance it wont let me
I think it will break $200 in a month or so. JMO
buying more when it hits 175 not falling for this stock will be back up above $200 in a week
"Look at the 5 year chart Great stock!,"
$195 open?
"PE ratio too high, growth has flattened"
RMD reached an all time high at 134.56
I'll get back in below 171.46 sold at 177.
Do they have a share buyback program?
looking good
Amazing how few posts there are on this board ! It's a great stock.
"Resmed saved my life, never have slept better. Proud owner of one of their CPAP's and the stock."
Cup/handle formation..
Just a constant up-slope for RMD. One of my best performers! I assume there will be unwarranted selling when earnings is reported. I'd like to know how long their extra market share will last due to the Philips recall? Anyone know?
My English isn’t good enough to interpret the article . I’m sorry guys
Great quarter!
Amazing how few posts for such a great growth stock.
Trump mentioned resmd as a ventilators producer just now.
"Touched $100 for a few minutes. Don't worry, it will be well over $100; after earnings news."
RMD reached an all time high at 130.00
When this stock goes back up it is going to be fast. I already added shares at this rediculous low price. JMO
"Wow, if I only had some cash to buy shares! Great price and should not be effected by the virus. In fact they will probably gain from it. JMO"
Amazing how many people know if earnings will beat before it happens. I want that Unfair advantage. Poo!
Goldman trying to steal your share. Please hold on to it and stay strong
"Somebody taking profits? (And I mean institutional investors) The last week has been tough and my stop losses kicked in - but, I am back in. I am hoping we will soon see the slow daily rise again. I stand by my earlier statements ... there are are only two public manufactures of CPAP machines. And one of them has a massive recall. I want to feel bullish, but last week has me a little spooked."
ATM $104.78 - Now record numbers.. 2.3% rise in Ax(??). Gotta be more air in this solid stock. Should easily pass ATM. Soon passing $110AIMHO
Up $4 after hours. This stock has been cheap for awhile now; it's a steady earner.
"Oh, I doubt if CPAP machine will cut it for Covid pneumonia"
Phillips revealing the toxic foam in their CPAP machines is the story today of ResMed's rally.
What will it take for this stock to rise
Morgan Stanley joins the party this morning as it raises target price on ResMed from $219 to $245. Not too shabby as that is a 12% increase.
Anyone think that they might do a 2 for 1 split since the price has continued to climb for years? There are less than 2 million shares issued.
Close to 52 week high!
"Poor acquisitions, buy back gone, stock still too pricey ???"
no dividend increase
Why down today?
please i need someone to put me through about RMD. i am new please.
And down in AHShould we not expect stock to rise
RMD reached a new All Time High at 114.00
Up 150% in last 5 years. Chech 5 year chart......
"Sold HSIC to get into RMD expecting a decient SP bump, but I'am gettt bupkis. Thoughts?"
"Once this is over, the market will be flooded with ventilators made by GE and such and this stock will collapse"
just doubled position
"Resmed CEO on Fox Business Tuesday just prior to the market close. Tried to post link, but apparently Yahoo doesn't allow."
This is all a short work of short sellers .....There is no way in normal sense that this can go down....Will be up. 30-40% in the next week or so..
I don't believe that it will stay this low very long.
I thing this stock has already bottomed out and is on it's way back up where it should be.
If you look at the 5 year chart this stock has doubled in price.
RMD reached a new All Time High at 111.94
Stay away from medical device stocks and labs. Things are not rosy at all and healthcare changes will blow these apart.
CFRA Keeps Sell Opinion On Shares Of Resmed Inc
ResMed reached an all time high at 220.00
Go back up to 2000 please
Maybe we found bottom; 15% correction from the high.
support at 200ema again
Just bought this stock. Really looks good for the long term.
Should I be loading up today?
After hours rise $0.79.
Sleepapnea market used to be a duopol market before the recall. Now it is a monopoly game with only one participant. On the side line perhaps FPH will benefit. Time will show
Intersest rate increase should have no effect on this stock becauae they have very little debt!
Company makes money and day traders cause stock to do down.
Great growth stock. approx. 13% avg. annual revenue growth in last 3 years and great 5 yr stock price chart.
waiting for 108
This is a $100 stock easy.
ResMed reached an all time high at 207.99
RMD is up 12.95% to 98.84
I wrote $100 and $105 call options on my stock holdings. Will expire before next earnings report.
It's over with this stock is now GARBAGE. I mean why would it drop after earnings? why not just sell before earnings. Makes no sense.
Interesting move after hours
pos
Just made a new 52 week high
"based on trade sizes, looks to me like funds are moving in ahead of earnings. upgrades will follow once the big money has taken significant positions. meanwhile rmd continues to outperform broader market on a relative basis. call it whatever you want, safe haven, growth, possibly even turning into a momentum play at some point soon. the market has been slow to appreciate the full impact and long term implications of this pandemic, but it is fundamentally changing the landscape for the foreseeable future. many more chronic respiratory conditions around the world will require long-term care. and all nations that can afford to do so will stockpile as never before because none will want to get caught flat-footed again."
buying opportunity bet this bounces back before close
There's support around 160.
"I knew nothing about them. So I googled today (8_06_2020) ""markets movers"" and I saw this one plunging 13% for the day. I did my homework and it turned out that I accidently had found a very good company. So I bought 100 at $178, and then to be sure I used a stop loss at 168. For now I'm under water ( at $175), but I will be patient and will really forget about them if the price sinks below $168. Who knows- these days the stock market is massaged by the big boys and they manipulate it as they wish and profit enormously at the expense of generation Z- real capitalism in its last stage !!!!"
EPS $0.92 VS. $0.83 analysts consensus. Revenues beat as well; which $592 million vs $565 million concensus. Margins we basically unchanged.
RMD reached an all time high at 155.58
Will go to $115+ by year end. JMO
Citigroup upgrades ResMed from neutral to buy this morning. [MT Newswires @ 0646 ET]
I’m wasn’t trying to scam any body. I bought lots shares off this company
"expensive , but management seems to be ok"
ResMed reached an all time high at 189.00
"Ugh here comes another earnings report market response. Last time the company reported good earnings, decent forecast, and the stock plummeted. I stayed in. We're almost back to where we were on Jan 28 at the last earnings report...what are folks thinking?"
"This is profit taking, they had another great quarter"
love the manipulation of this somebody's playing it like a fiddle buy buy buy
if it crosses 171.46 it's all over IMO 6 month average
"A scam company, IMHO. I believe in natural selection. Even the smallest disadvantages are quickly bred out of a species. The tendency to stop breathing, it seems to me, would be quickly eliminated. Total BS, like most things emanating from Australia,"
Almost at 52 week high. I think that they will have anther great quarter.
There is evidence that CPAPs and BiPAPs actually do a better job of treating people than ventilators. I would think this should be good for Resmed? Or are investors more focused on declining doctors visits which mean fewer sleep apnea diagonses?
The stock is up now; good earnings results and bright outlook!
every stock good earnings have galen after. The big bits are running the stocks up into earnings then selling. It is bs
"Looking for an entry price, any suggestions? Thanks,Ed"
Short squezze big time
"$RMD up 3% beat, stock up 13 pts."
new buyers comming in
Short squezze...............
ResMed reached an all time high at 214.41
RMD is up 8.93% to 132.20
10% more then lol
Addition of MatrixCare is a brilliant strategic belt on.
Great quarter !!
Channel check...Mobi sales are ramping up.
RMD is down -5.04% to 103.14
it's just in play big boys trying to make a killing
Ugh
"There's so many things to love about this company given COVID-19. Their CPAP business will take a hit, but their device manufacturing and homecare services will boom with the virus's spread. These guys will be saving many, many lives."
Why is not official information about this going down ?
a lot of after hours movement upward. don't see any news though.
RMD reached a new All Time High at 98.84
Very nice press release. Well done IR team...Getting the message out that ResMed is on the 'front lines' of Covid-19 and providing much needed equipment and supplies around the world.
wow....pos
Won't be long before RMD is back over $100. I'll sell long term calls on my holdings at that point.
Make your case.. no matter what ..Resmed is a screaming buy
New 52 week high
why such a low dividend?
Another 52 week high!
"Slow continuous rise with very low beta. Let's look at the facts. There are only two major CPAP manufactures: Phillips and ResMed. According to an old article from 2020, Phillip has a 62% market share and ResMed has a 33% market share. In mid-June 2021, the market leader initiates a recall of their CPAP machine due to cancerous foam used in sound suppression. That means there is only one real CPAP manufacturer left - which means from my perspective ResMed now has 95% of the market. ResMed of course cannot keep up with the demand. Phillips has not indicated how they plan to remediate the problem. I only see ResMed going up. Financials are stable and debt is below assets. Look at the graphs starting in June 2021 and ask yourself - WHY AM I NOT IN ResMed?!?!"
I think ULTIMATSTOKCALERT has the super trade ideas. look them up .
"looking at the history of RMD, it slides for few days after reporting then it starts climbing, my guess it will bottom this Friday."
"RMD will more than likely crush earnings and give upbeat forecast for future, but until I see a FDA statement that Respironics is the only manufacturer going to be subject to a Class I recall, the risk still exists. Not going to trust a statement from ResMed as the end-all. Long-term risk for all PAP manufacturers ( which is basically Resmed, Respironics, and F&P) is cpap could go OTC. I'm sure their are a lot of people ( Sleep Docs, owners of Sleep Labs , DMEs) that have great clinical arguments of why this shouldn't happen and it probably mirrors that of audiologist regarding the current OTC legislation for Hearing - aids. None of this is to say ResMed isnt going to be around for a longtime and a good company- just not a buy at current price"
Resmed one of ventilator sources mentioned by President tonight.
No financial reason for the drastic drop in price. Probably Institute manipulation to drive price down. I am adding shares...JMO
"Article on CBS NEWS,""Sleep apnea sufferers frustrated over CPAP machine recall"" dated Sept 6th. Phillips says it will replace or repair devices within approximately 12 months .... once the FDA approves a solution. Again slow continuous rise with low beta."
Showing strong support at $91
Resmed delivers 3000 new ventilators to Australian hospitals.https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/australias-ventilator-stockpile-up-by-3000/news-story/e6f16e273fc1e5367d6a4f7722547cf7Well done Resmed and good timing just before our quarterly update.
blue horseshoe loves annocott steel
"Great opportunity. Highly exagerated pullback. Heck, they beat on EPS!"
As I understand this foam case Philips/Resp is currently out of business in terms of selling CPAP devices.I do not think a 12% SP increase is enough
Like Coca Cola and Pepsi Resmed and Philips is a duopol marked. Imagine if ie Coca Cola all of a sudden disappeared... because of a health issue..
"History repeating itself. Take a look at chart of RMD back in January 2019. Don't know the story (don't care), but the stock closed on 1/24/2019 at 117.30. The next day, it opened at 100.48 and close the day at 94.56. The stock did recover, although it took better than 4 months to get back to that level. Don't think it will take that long this time, but be patient, this is a good company in a great business.RC"
Why are we down today?
"New to the stock. I wish I would have bought earlier, but better late than never. RMD has a great management team, and I see huge growth potential long-term."
I am!!! Excellent shout out.
$120 by year end. Earnings this week will beat estimates.
What is the ex-div date?
BEAST
ResMed reached an all time high at 211.25
did this the other morning too up $3.25 premarket ended day down $2.30
total red alert hereduring covid RMD would have sold tons of ventilator around the globe..but as reported with earnings of just 10% weird innit ?
Noticed that this has been quite volatile recently - thought it would have been quieter and slowly moving up
All these high priced stocks need a 20 percent haircut.
Knocking on $110.
Looks like the tide is turning. 12:53 at 177. Let's see if some volume comes in after lunch.
"After hours, moved up again. lol"
"Generally, but with exceptions galore, when a stock goes down this much and closes near its day's bottom, there is more pain ahead. But, I hope this would be one of the exception cases. As someone mentioned, with such a big run up, there is bound to be profit taking at the slightest hint of bad news, not to mention that people may prefer to be in cash with so much uncertainty around trade deal, govt. shutdown, worldwide economy slowing, etc."
This stock has almost tripled in 5 years. Check out 5 year chart. It looks like it will continue to grow based on MAX chart.
"I think the bottom will be around 94 - 95, then back up. Just a guess."
"A 20% haircut seems really excessive considering the ""miss"" wasn't that much. Assume lots of folks took profits after such a long run up."
"Hello everyone ! Cramer said to buy this couple of months ago when it was $95 and I watched it run up to $115 and now back to 103 due to market sell off, assuming this market sell off comes to an end at some point what price would you say its a good buy ? maybe $95ish, thank you and Merry Christmas !"
Just added more shares. I will hold long term.
the rotation continues. slow & steady wins the race. eventually the herd will move out of wishful thinking overvalued plays like uber & sbux and into growth stories like rmd. imagine uber being currently worth more than twice resmed and starbucks worth more than 4 times as much. rmd is worth $500/share if it's worth a dime
RMD reached an all time high at 164.09
than why is it going down?
Why the drop?
RMD will rock after they report their earnings!!! GO RMD GO!!!
Anyone know why this is down?
Don't be surprised if you see them take it down to the 178 area today.
"up 3.25 premarket, starting the long road to recovery"
Hello? Anyone out there? LOL
nice rise
"Wow, lots of profit-taking."
it's over value at this price.wait till $78 before throwing in your hard earn money.
not rattling my cage just loaded up on more

i've been rewarded
"If you are thinking of buying this stock just look at their 5 year chart. Very impressive, that is why I bought it and add some on pullbacks.... Great long term stock. JMO"
Consensus EPS estimate is 92 cents; I figure closer to $1.00. This stock is grossly undervalued.
just bought additional 100 shares at 177.50
Be sure to check outMIME...about to rocket
This stock is getting smashed. Can someone please explain to me why this is happening after a positive earnings report? Is it just profit taking or am I missing something?
company drops 17 percent on great earnings stock market is so ridiculous.. with no real reason to drop at all
Another great quarter. This company is on a long steady year after year of growth.
I like it a lot
Another 52 week high!!! Amazing
ResMed reached an all time high at 202.34
Up $1.3 after hours again.
Is today’s fall news related?
Can’t believe no one is mentioning Resmed was on Mad Money yesterday
"Looks like all dust settling down, good entry point looks like"
reading into that report with some of the gaap/non gaap differentials i am surprised this is up not down.
Finally a postiive move.
"Big hedge fund was messing around with this good stock last week to lower the price. Hold on to your position for long. It is a great company with great products. Take a look at the 5 days graph on Yahoo , the same exact volume was responsible for the steep decline last week."
"Way, way oversold, going to add some shares. Can't resist at this price. JMO"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/coronavirus-covid19-army-joins-production-line-ventilator-makers-12563620
"Fantastic growth, revenue was 1.7 billion in 2015 and 2.3 billion in 2018."
"Gonna scoop 100 at open. 20% down friday on a rather small rev miss but with earnings being up. Company acquired two other companies thus why the minor miss. I dont care about any 5 dollar swings, ill get a dividend, and price will climb back fast before next earnings. For dividend collectors, good value here now that price has deflated, next ex divi on feb 6th, so youll want to grab it before then. For shorters: downside probably limited to another dollar or two, make sure you pull out before any rebound and then play the 99-105 range."
Buying no doubt
well. it's going to be a LONG day today
What in gods good name happend here?!!?!?!?!!?
Respirators Ventilators. Period.Name of the game for the next year internationally. This stock is poised to rocket
Anyone think this stock will do a 2:1 stock split soon like it did in 2010 and 2005?
"I recommend reading the transcript also. I'm impressed with the considered, thoughtful delivery and the outlined 5y strategy from this CEO. I like a 5y strategy... but I doubt I'll hold this stock for 5m.You never know if there's more pain to follow after a 20% cut but it seems to me that cut reflected mostly how fast this SP has come up and not issues with the company long-term. This may be ride lower for a little while but in a few months I'm thinking I'll be happy I bought this now.Some of these medtech stocks are high flyers. Last year I bought Penumbra after a 15% drop on earnings and sold it a month later up over 20%. I sure wish that happened every time! Good luck to longs only."
Back over $100; after earnings.
"while everyone is focused on the fatality rate, flattening the curve and eventually pulling out of this nightmare, many are missing the bigger picture here. a sizable percentage of coronavirus patients are requiring critical care including invasive ventilation, often for weeks at a time before recovering. the world average seems to be holding at around 5% of the total confirmed infected population. many of these recovered patients will be facing chronic lung issues requiring the very types of treatments RMD supports. as this virus rolls across the globe doing its damage in what could easily be 3 phases over the next 18 mos it will unfortunately leave millions of recovered victims requiring supportive respiratory therapies for the rest of their lives. additionally, governments around the world will be stockpiling everything from masks, to gloves to other PPE materials, as well as CPAP, vents, etc. no one will want to be unprepared going forward and ignoring this now clearly known and measurable threat would be politically unwise in the extreme. demand for these products and the money to procure them will be built into national budgets for years to come. this is a massive growth opportunity for a company doing good in the world and investors focused on the wrong things will miss it"
I have owned this stock since it was at $103 and it keeps going up. Amazing
