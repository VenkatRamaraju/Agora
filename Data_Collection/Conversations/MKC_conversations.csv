It’s frustrating to see the stock price languish so long.
"I see MkC's ""organic"" spices at Dollarama now (Canadas largest dollar store). Not sure what it means. Are they dumping it, or sometimes vendors make products especially for Dollarama to capture market share, even if at a discount (it is a really big chain with a lot of buying power)."
Here is another company (MKC) that fell under the (advisory fee) aka( market manipulation and rigging)just exceeded profit by 10% and the stock is down.
"Watching the stock drop day after day and month after month for so long is disappointing to say the least. Dear Board of Directors-are you thinking about/acting on anything that would improve this? It’s your responsibility to guide the company and management to healthy growth and success. Your responsibilities are different from and sometimes conflict with what’s best for the management. For example, a low stock prove due to so-so performance may be good for management because they get stock option grants at the lower prices, but it’s certainly not good for the health of the company or the satisfaction of its shareholders. The length of decline and its consistency aren’t reasonable at this point. I hope you do what’s right for the company and it’s shareholders. Sincerely"
So disappointing to watch the daily stock performance over the last year

"Very strange. The 5-year chart still looks 'ok' but the 1 year is awful.This doesn't make sense considering the coronavirus. Most stocks related to eating at home have done well over that period ?Many here are saying it's the shorts holding it down. Not sure if I agree with that or not ?Others say the multiple is too high. Yahoo shows a PE of 31. If that's correct, I tend to agree with them."
"I’ve been watching mkc for many years and I’ve been invested for about 5 years or so. The stock performance over the last 12 months has been a downer; the years before were uppers. It seems that the market simply isn’t interested in mkc. Volume is so low most days. Institutions own a big chunk, but management owns very little. What’s management’s incentive to step out of its comfort zone—increase in option value OR job security? If job security is the biggest driver (which I suspect is the case), then management won’t be too aggressive in making changes or taking risks that could elevate the company to new level. That’s where the Board of Directors comes in. It’s one thing to pat management on the back for keeping the existing business going well, while it’s another thing to question whether the company is foregoing opportunities or avoiding developments that would take the company to higher levels and make it an impressive performer in today’s environment. I wonder!"
I’m backing the truck up on MKC and KMB. High quality companies at discount prices.
"I saw someone inquire in a reply about the French's purchase and what products it entailed. They bought out the ""RB Foods"" group from Reckitt and Benckiser, which is an Anglo-Dutch group (like Unilever) that has/had consumer product goods, food, cleaners, etc. This group included all of French's (mustard, ketchup, the onion toppers, etc)., all of Frank's Red Hot (sauces, mixes, etc.), and Cattleman's barbecue sauces. It is a significant suite of products and brand names that has considerably increased the size of McCormick's revenues, profits, margins, distribution channels, and overall consumer market and mind share. They have some nice slides in their investor relations publications that show the suite of products acquired, as well as the new product offerings that they have already designed for release (and those which are on their way)."
down 17% in the last 10 months at this rate it will take years to just break even.
"High quality name, but the stock has further to fall given the overvaluation in the stock currently."
Stock performance weak all 2021 and since Q4 2020. It’s hard to watch!
$MKC Maintains Credit Suisse Outperform USD 100 » USD 98 Target Lowered by Deutsche Bank Hold USD 91 » USD 89
"I went shopping at our local Walmart yesterday. I was looking for Nutmeg and pepper corns. Not available in MKC. And I may add, very little MKC products at all. It was like they were selling out of MKC and not replacing anything. I have been a long term holder of MKC and found this upsetting."
Is this on the way back up after the current supply chain issues are over or is it time to sell and buy back after the correction?
Sad to see so many people with flavor sol business leaving this company becz of poor management. They will fail in future
"Forward PE is 26.5. Shorts are 1.59% of outstanding—a pretty small amount. Stock likely to rise over next 12 months I’m the absence of extraordinary events (positive or negative). I speculate (I.e., I’m guessing) that something out of the ordinary will occur in the near future."
"Cash $300MM, DEBTS $5.5BB, (w bb). Way over valued!"
