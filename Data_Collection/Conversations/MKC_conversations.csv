Dear McCormick Management: Please manage your stock price and market perception as well as you manage your business. It is frustrating to say the least to see the market's seeming disinterest.Thank you
"This article says several important things about MKC and its manage,met and growth strategy. I had inferred some of these things from watching and reading about MKC, and it’s good to see them made highlighted more broadly."
why is this going up today?
"wow....spices? Who'd a thought this would be so lucrative??? I mean.....I grow my own herbs in my backyard rather they paying for store spices....but yes, I do still buy some store spices....but its not like I go through them in a week or anything like that.....anyway....enjoy the ride...."
"This stock is a long term investment in the lower risk level side. It’s not not one for readers who are in and out, nor is it for market timers."
"Are there buried positive secrets in these string, impressive numbers?Two things: (a) commercial-restaurant business is down only 4% compared to prior year quarter that ended in Feb 2020...pre-pandemic, and (b) very big growth in Asia sales. Only 4% down from PRE-pandemic with restaurants closed or reduced dramatically....that seems like a very small decrease in relation to the decline in restaurant business in the quarter ended Feb 2021 compared to Feb 2020. And Asia growth potential ....need we say more to get the point across????Is MKC management being ultra careful or conservative in not underscoring these, even though they’ve given us the Asia growth % (but without underscoring what it may portend)? And how did they keep the restaurant and commercial business at only down 4%? Like all of you, I’m an outsider, so I don’t know the answers to these questions. It would be nice to know."
MKC is up 4.92% to 111.14
UBS said SELL today ! (PT : 147 - 155)
MKC back to normal. Stock looking good today.
MKC-V reached a new All Time High at 108.50
"Anybody else up early waiting for the 6:30 AM ET earnings release?? I am, looking to cash out with minimum 1K gain on my 240 shares later today, and then going long either SFIX or UNFI, both of which are reporting earnings after the close today, and I expect both of them to beat the consensus with positive guidance...Trying to decide which is the better play...I like the volatility of SFIX, but UNFI should have outstanding revenue growth. Maybe I'll split my capital and do a long play on both. But in the meantime, MKC to $166.00/shr, please. :-)"
MKC reached a new All Time High at 121.46
"Forward PE is 26.5. Shorts are 1.59% of outstanding—a pretty small amount. Stock likely to rise over next 12 months I’m the absence of extraordinary events (positive or negative). I speculate (I.e., I’m guessing) that something out of the ordinary will occur in the near future."
MKC-V reached a new All Time High at $134.89
MKC is up 5.75% to 132.86
MKC-V is down 5.78% to 129.39
"Recent drops and jumps in price have not been based on the company’s performer, but rather by traders and supposed pundits. If you’re in the stock because you like the company and it’s performance, then you have to take deep breaths or let out yells when the short term volatility erupts and remember that it’s short term and you’re long term ....and in the long term the stock price will be a function of the company’s performance."
220 today? I feel something good coming
I guess sometimes the per hour price doesn’t mean anything. Can’t get in at 185 even though it shows 2 times this morning.
So from June 2018 until Nov 2018 MKC sold 50% more #$%$ and that's why the price rose by 50%? In six months they managed to increase their numbers by 50%. Really?!!! Overinflated and waaay overbought.
"MKC is a solid, well run, smart company. They appear to understand their customers and the markets in which they operate. Management has delivered solid and impressive performance, making good decisions at several levels. Stock price is consistent with performance—it’s a good price in the sense that it’s a strong number because it’s a string company that’s delivering strong performance. Stock price should hold and grow steadily, but not at the rate seen so far this year. Another surge in price, similar to the one that’s been experienced in 2018, would only be justified by an unusual event, like another strategic acquisition or a takeover bid by a larger company. The possibility of more smart acquisitions by management seems reasonable, as they have demonstrated excellence in this regard. I’m a hold and enjoy the solid ride."
MKC reached an all time high at 167.18
"Fantastic earnings report and guidance for 2017 of $4.32 adjusted EPS I think $5 is possible for 2018, and have a $125 price target on the stock"
Can’t be sure til next week but Thursday was a possible bull trap. VP exercised options too so possibly thinking that it was near enough to a top. Careful out there peeps. Protect your investment. Take profits or cover if you must!
MKC-V reached a 52 Week low at 121.09
"***Speculation Alert**Hain Celestial breaking off protein division ahead of potential sale of company. I hope they break off Celestial Seasonings-- that would be an incredible fit for MKC. They already source and sell most of the same herbal ingredients. They could buy in greater volume at lower prices and have two aisles to sell herbs and spices!They mentioned Unilever as potential buyer of the company, but they have Lipton. I don't think anti-trust would allow them to control two of the largest tea brands in the U.S."
Looking really attractive. People still like seasoning on their food even at home.
McCormick is down 5.02% to 185.38
"Rotation, rotation going on. I have always wanted to own this name. So bought today at $168"
Added more at $184.25
Lawsuit because was not enough stock for demand. Good company in future.
People have rediscovered cooking at home and it will continue.
I buy McCormick products on Amazon. I don't think Amazon is a threat.
Nice watching MKC today.
one spice to rule the world. yeehaw
"Stock has moved a lot this year, but largely justified by excellent performance and solidness of the improvements. Business is solid and safe. Management performance in guiding the core business and making strategic acquisitions has been demonstrably successful. Stock is reliable and, medium to long term, a safe investment. Low trading volume and high institutional ownership support strength in stock price, and also encourage more growth to increase enterprise value."
"Strong price movement. One thing I’m able to see that is different is that the short % has dropped a lot, which means the shirts have had to cover —-and since the short % was a lot higher than it is now, that would have meant a fair amount of buying. Besides that, I haven’t seen anything else out of the ordinary, except of course the pandemic....could that be the reason for the movement?"
"This market is totally based on luck... If you are with biggies/shorties, you win, otherwise lose. This is one of the best companies and gave exceptional results and guidance.. .and it's DOWN... Can you believe it.?"
Snail crawling in the wrong direction is MKC.
"For those who focus on P/E Multiple, my thoughts are these: PE is a classic measure and it's certainly relevant, but it's one of several metrics that are just as important or sometimes more important, but most importantly many metrics have to be looked at together . . . AND!!!! the strength and performance of management, historical performance, consistency, predicability/reliability in terms of performance, long term prospects, opportunities that the company has, and other factors are important to consider in making an investment decision. If PE was the end-all and be-all, we would see a market crash across the board, especially in the tech and younger/smaller-companies sectors. MKC is valued based on all of the above considerations, and obviously the market believes it scores well in many of them and hence a strong positive sentiment and hence a higher P/E."
Really bad looking balance sheet. Negative net tangible assets. Lots of Goodwill and tons of debt. The earnings are not high enough to justify the debt load. Lots of these big brands are going to recognize that the debt is not always worth the small pickups in earnings. Look at Kraft Heinz trading for a third of what it did a couple years ago. Here we have a spice company trading at 4X Revenue NOT earnings. Will go much lower.
McCormick reached an all time high at 176.33
"Just went Long 240 shares at $156.27. I expect an Earnings beat tomorrow morning, with positive guidance going forward, to propel the stock price past the $160.00 level. Putting a $166.00 Limit Sell to lock in profit if she pops up big in the early morning. They beat the consensus last earnings and guided higher, I expect the same tomorrow morning. This sector is a safe harbor from political and economic turmoil, which is why I think even a modest beat will be rewarded by a nice pop up in the stock price."
What are the reasons that mkc has held up well during the recent negativity in the markets?
MKC reached a new All Time High at 108.95
I'm waiting could use a little cash but not bad enough to sell at this price point even though I bought mine when it was way cheaper
"There is a battle for spices in the South China Sea and deep in the mountains beyond China, in Western Tibet. Not many know about it, but McCormick is actually a subsidiary of the CIA, and the spice trade is actually a front for drug and weapons transactions that keep the world safe and full of cheap, plentiful spices. This company is actually a gray market whale worth 4.7x more than its market cap belies...think about it....spices are the most powerful item on earth"
"A 3 CENT miss does not justify an over 10 % drop, load up on this train and stay on it for the ride ,boooooooooooooooooooooya"
"Since it did not move much fromLast earnings, this could go 210-15 levels easy"
"BUY SPICES!!! More valuable than wheat, soy bean, cotton, and rubber combined! This is how money is made folks. Uncorrelated risk in the spice markets. Economic troubles in the broad markets means spices are worth more money every day. It appreciates in value as you appreciate its remarkable flavor. We can't underestimate the value here in MKC. This company can easily be worth $300 in 2020...lots of upside and spicy trades in future."
"I assume the stock price movement is because of two things: one-earnings are about to be released, and two-lots of investors have gains because the stock has done so well over the past several months, and they want to cash in on those before the earnings release.I continue to believe that one should look at this investment with a long term point of view, not just how the stock price will move from one day to another or one week to another. I believe the company is solid, the management is good, and the prospects are good. Therefore, I am going to hold And I expect that the price will rise nicely over the long-term. I have been in the stock for over two years, and have been rewarded nicely for that. Good luck to all."
MKC-V reached a new All Time High at 119.32
A little bit more of a drop then a big bounce is coming
"At recent price levels, MKC is a great buy, likely a steal!Think about it—the economy is reopening and that trend is going to accelerate in the next few months. Restaurants are reopening and that will accelerate with the pandemic easing and warmer weather coming. MKC products will sell much higher this spring and summer vs 2020!!!And, over the past year, more people have come to use and enjoy MKC products at home. It doesn’t take much to see what lies ahead. All of this, on top of a management team that has a great track record. Not to sound too pedantic, but duhhhh."
The market does not like this acquisition...
I don't know what time is earning today . I saw it went down now it's where it was from yesterday closed ?
"Nearly 90% of mkc is owned by institutions. That makes a lot of sense because mkc sells products that are always wanted, performs consistently, has evolved in an evolving world, and has proven it can make good decisions. That’s a safe and sound investment that’s very likely to grow. It’s not high-tech:high risk/reward, and instead it’s solid, steady, low-risk and regularly growing. That equals a very good investment, and the knowledgeable professional investors recognize it. Me too!"
MKC-V is down 10.00% to 134.28
"This company, guided by its stable leadership team, keeps on delivering and delivering. It is a great example of what focus, effort and intelligence can accomplish. Congratulations from a very satisfied and experienced shareholder."
MKC-V reached an all time high at 188.84
Pleased that the stock has recovered. The $500 million equity portion of the deal was disclosed when the deal was announced. That would seem to have informed Mr. Market that there would be dilution to existing shareholders but when the offering was announced yesterday some trading programs suddenly swung into action. The longer I am in the market (over half a century) the dumber it looks. If only someone could harness the stupidity we would all be rich. The deal is expensive but as a long term investor I am inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to management.
See the following article that views the company in a similar manner as I described.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mccormick-shareholders-happy-week-041500699.html
We were looking good last week. But here it goes again. Probably headed back to $190
MKC is up 6.51% to 140.90
Bought some 165 calls right before close. Let’s see how this plays out..
"The shorts in this stock are gamblers, of which there are plenty in the overall market. This company is a longer term investment, and it seems odd that short players would be interested...must be players on the spectrum. They’d have to be meticulous in their timing, which is unlikely given the unpredictability of the short term movements in stocks generally. It’s sounder to okay long term, which for this company is the right position."
Can't you see... It's shorts all across... When you see low volume manipulation... you know it's shorts.. They are rampant everywhere now... SEC should intervene....
I eat the seasoning straight.
MKC-V is up 9.42% to 116.46
McCormick reached an all time high at 206.31
"Re acquisitions—I assume management has a sharp focus on strategic opportunities if there are any that are open to or in need of a transaction. The company has a good thing going as things stand now and that good thing has to be cared for with the utmost TLC. Company leadership seems to check that box well. But then there’s also the natural confidence that they can do more and add to the good thing they’re already doing that can lead to expansion in various ways, including through acquisitions. I would think that in these challenging times, there would be opportunities out there. The decision making, however, would be a balancing act between keeping the good thing we already have in tact and not hurting it vs possibly growing even stronger by taking on something new."
And so it begins...
MKC-V is up 12.84% to 134.41
"At first glance, the acquisition sounds pricey. Thoughts appreciated."
SHORTED 193.50
How does this company have so little cash?
Same thing happened with CLX for a long time. Never trust these analysts blindly.
"Very strange. The 5-year chart still looks 'ok' but the 1 year is awful.This doesn't make sense considering the coronavirus. Most stocks related to eating at home have done well over that period ?Many here are saying it's the shorts holding it down. Not sure if I agree with that or not ?Others say the multiple is too high. Yahoo shows a PE of 31. If that's correct, I tend to agree with them."
Guess it was sell on the news. I will look to add on weakness.
Did they talk about it on CNBC I missed it ?
"I don’t understand why price has declined last several days. Perhaps it’s because price is strong already, so short term players aren’t playing. If a long term player who buys a lot wants to get in because they see it as a long term win prospect, then they’ll be glad to buy in at this price."
HUGE upside as home cooking takes off and will continue through next year until herd immunity sets in which may take another year and a half.
Samuel I’m sorry but you can’t justify buying this when it was 30+ P/E at the top. You say we “can’t say for sure” but fundamentals give us highly educated guess as that is what hedges and institutions look for as well. If you can’t decipher an company through it’s reporting and figure fair value and know when buying high is too high and when you’re just joining a trend then you are gambling not investing.
Old Bay hot sauce is selling out in Annapolis. Where can I get some?
Anyone here? This is a good stock and interesting company.
"Shorts are down to 1.85%. They used to be 6%+. Given the consistency of performance, advancements of the company, and continuity of management—this is not a good short play. The earlier shorts discovered that the hard way. The current shorts are either computers that don’t reason or gamblers playing with other peoples $$$."
Earnings $0.79 per share. $0.10 worse than the consensus prediction.

"I think of this investment is a reliable place to put fairly conservative portion of my investment portfolio. The products they sell, spices and relate, have been in demand for thousands of years, and the McCormick brand has long been recognized as a tried and true leader. I'm not aware of any reason why that would change for the worse in the foreseeable future. Management as steered this ship in a solid and steady fashion, it seems. All that equates to a nice place to put conservative investment dollars and hope/expect them to grow at a decent rate (if not better) on a long term basis."

"Hey, MKC, I will have to eat less meat if the share price keeps trending down. Less meat means less MKC seasoning, less seasoning sold means lower share price....means less meat....this will spiral down."

EX DIVIDEND OCT 2
"Excellent acquisition target!! Not only does this give them more market share in the space (and more mind share of the consumer), it also gives them: a new platform for flavor expansion/integration with other product offerings, and increased purchasing power for their input ingredients to keep cost of goods sold in check. This gives then increased buying power for peppers, vinegar, and glass bottles from their suppliers. Very, very curious to see what their next target might be going forward. They now have multiple product offerings in the bbq sauce space (Cattleman's and Stubbs), multiple hot sauce offerings, plus ketchup and mustard on top of their existing spice/herb/pepper offerings. Mizkan Group would be an incredible acquisition target, and likely something on the scale and breadth of the Reckitt acquisition-- vinegars, cooking wines, pasta sauces and more. All things that provide recognized flavor brands, the potential for both consumer and commercial sales, the ability to lever purchasing power for input ingredients, and more methods of cross-pollinating product lines and delivering new flavor profiles."

Should recover into low $30's by early next week...selloff overdone....this stock is defensive and with the markets being volatile expect people to buy in for safety...especially after this big drop.
"It’s interesting and nice to see how mkc has held up at the price level of $155-$160+ for a good deal of time. It makes sense, considering that it’s stable, consistent and forward-looking. The company should perform well with steady increases, so it will grow into its multiple. However, I suspect it’s people’s hope and even exportation that the company will do some acquisitive work to boost-accelerate an otherwise smooth and steady growth. Let’s see!"

MKC was pretty richly priced but that should have been bled out by now."

An earnings beat and it closes under 90?
Got 100 shares and thinking about more. MKC is going up if the market goes down.
"The market has a lot more respect for this stock now. The short % is a tad over 2%, but several months ago it was 6+%. Q2 earnings will likely be decent but lower than last year considering the CV quarantining. Q3 will edge up as restaurants reopen, but not as good as last year because the restaurants aren’t going to be nearly as bustling as last year. Nonetheless, we should see reliable and predictable performance out of MKC that’s good considering the circumstances, and that should reassure the market that MKC is what we think it is—a steady, focused, capable company that meets its challenges and provides products that consumers like and value."

"I have been following this company for years. I have been an investor for years.This has been, and still is, a solid and reliable company. They keep up with the times, they don’t just rely on their historical performance, they add new products, they update their systems, they remain modern. They also make smart, insightful acquisitions, with a successful history of integration and growth.The investor market has recognized that by rewarding the company with a high multiple on earnings. However, the company has lived up to those expectations, and therefore the market has continued to see the company in that light. If you look at the stock trading history, you see that from time to time the price moves down for no reason, like today – except that an individual at UBS decided to say the price is too high end and then the stock price returns to where the market believes it should be, which is at the levels of the past few weeks endin the $170 price level, approximately.Institutional investors like this company, and today is an excellent opportunity to increase their holdings. I already have a lot, it is my highest holding in a thoughtful portfolio, and I am happy and comfortable with my holdings.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
Junk of a stock.
Got in at 185 finally. It will turn around the rest of the day. Maybe at 193 again by the end of the day.
"Mkc is 87% owned by institutions. Hence, daily trading of broadly owned stock is limited to a small % of the shares. This makes for unusual movement at times."

The tepid outlook is bringing this down to more reasonable levels, but it's not a buy until it's back down near 52 week lows of right around $100 per share in my opinion."
MKC paying ten times sales for a hot sauce company. This market is nuts.
"just bought the other day, now 101, drops 3 bucks, and these mm, ... some kind of conspiracy against the direct purchase plan participants."
Couple of comments:1) the stock is still up over 20% from its price at the end of 2017.2) my wife and I have been in this stock for more than 20 yrs. It was our biggest holding until today but it will be again.3) I bought 5 June $120 call options today. I think thisselloff is an over reaction although the stock was selling at a fairly high multiple.We will continue to hold and hopefully flip the options at a profit.
"Stock price movement the last few days--up and sometimes down a $2-$3 per day is odd because there isn't any significant news. Anyone have ideas?Separately, I hope that management is searching for more synergistic acquisitions since they pulled the last one off so well. Recall that the market criticized them the last time, saying that they'd overpaid. What that showed us shareholders is that management new exactly what they were doing . . . which is what you'd hope and expect from good executives--CEO, CFO, COO, maybe others. Also, I would think that MKC is an attractive target for larger food distribution companies because the brand is solid, the relationships are solid, and there could be great synergy in merging MKC into another good company. However, this may be a less likely scenario in light of the high comp levels of several key execs at MKC. Overall, being in this stock seems like a sensible place to be."
What do you guys think the sp would have to get to for them to split? looks like the last one was in '02.
"? as purchase includes stock, does this negate the goodwill tax write off deduction here? I had always heard that to write off goodwill in a purchase it had to be all cash or no Boot (stock). if they get the tax write off, it should be a good deal for them. Does anybody know the answer here/ ?"

Their annual report has a lot of SJW-type commentary. is that the problem with the company stock price?
It should be around $110 by this fall

"Potential acquisition for MKC.... Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. (AMNF)? Constructive thoughts?"
"MKC: Strong sales & profits - Upbeat earnings in Q2 - Beats Q2 forecast....all really good things, and guess what? The stock plummets at the opening, this morning. WHY???? This is why the market sometimes really frustrates me. Its like you do your home work and everything right and you still lose."
Sick of seeing red daily... not good for your eyes as well as your wallet. MKC management needs to do something like buying back shares.
"Wow! MKC completed it's acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's food division today. That's got to be one the fasted acquisition closing's ever for a deal of that size. About one month from announced date is pretty amazing and shows MKC was prepared for this. Still think it was pricey, but congrats to MKC for getting what they wanted. I'll be rooting for you and reinvesting those dividends in the meantime."
New to MKC but concerned about the debt . From what I’ve put together they had enough earning power that the debt isn’t a concern . Can someone correct me here ?
Bottom is in folks....BUY!

Buy this French Onion Dip! Going up the food chain big today...spices don't sink!
let's get spicy! we light this cinnamon stick on fire and take spices to outer space! $205 is my target. no reason why spices won't become more valuable than the silver...more valuable than Litecoin...more resilient than the US dollar...we take this up from here and crush the market
"MKC got a big boost from the 2020 shutdowns, with many more people cooking at home. With the arrival of effective vaccines, the virus panic will finally come to an end next year and things will get back to normal. Retail sales of spices and condiments will fall as a result. This will be partially offset by sales to reopening restaurants, but those sales represent only 20% of MKC sales. The other 80% is retail. I predict the stock price will drop 20-30% by the end of 2021 as a result."
MKC reached a 52 Week low at 137.01
Does the company own the Kohinoor brand? It had paid more than $100M to acquire this company. The founders of Kohnioor continue to use this brand and have products competing with Mccormick.
I speculate that the sharp downward pressure is from an institution exiting. I expect the upward will occur when it’s done.
"It doesn't say much for Baltimore teachers when they tell students to boo Melania. Heres a woman, with a Be Best agenda of trying to keep kids off drugs, and be the best they can be. And teachers who get paid an average of 60,000 a year, care more about their job, than forming positives attitudes for children. This is why we need school choice. To help keep disrespectful teachers from having any contact with our children. These teachers are also instilling other bad behaviors on our innocents. McCormick is going to have trouble finding good workers with area public schools having a bad influence on them when they are young."

"In Jan 2019, the stock dropped from 150 to 120's range. any one knows what the sharp drop?"
UL getting bought out. More consolidation in this space. I think MKC would be a better fit for KFT IMHO

Anyone here?
"I saw someone inquire in a reply about the French's purchase and what products it entailed. They bought out the ""RB Foods"" group from Reckitt and Benckiser, which is an Anglo-Dutch group (like Unilever) that has/had consumer product goods, food, cleaners, etc. This group included all of French's (mustard, ketchup, the onion toppers, etc)., all of Frank's Red Hot (sauces, mixes, etc.), and Cattleman's barbecue sauces. It is a significant suite of products and brand names that has considerably increased the size of McCormick's revenues, profits, margins, distribution channels, and overall consumer market and mind share. They have some nice slides in their investor relations publications that show the suite of products acquired, as well as the new product offerings that they have already designed for release (and those which are on their way)."
By noon it will go back to 190.
"It’s like COST. Open lower after earnings report. Then a day later, shoot up 10 dollars. If it does not get to 195 today. Hold on long, it will be $200!by Friday."
what is the split date?
"Dividend raised to $2.08. Just shy of the $2.09 at the high-end of the range I pointed out 4 months back. Looking good so far. Just need to get some solid EPS results into the historical data to bring down the P/E a bit. Notice this is trading sort of rough, but showing solid consolidation around the $100 level while other food stocks (CPB for one) disappoint. It gets hit when people sell off food and/or defensive consumer names. But it is not collapsing. P/E staying high (and should come down a bit as the EPS rises). Looking against the out year predictions of $5+ EPS and you get a P/E in the 20 range vs. historic average in the mid-20's.Looking out to other acquisitions or business expansions... I would really like to see them move more into Indian products for US market to stay in line with demographic changes. They already have Asian, Hispanic, and most European cuisines covered. Indian and other Pacific cuisine additions would be interesting... as well as African to bring something home from Ethiopian restaurants and others. I would really like to see future acquisitions focus on USD denominated sales to mitigate their growing FX headwind that has hit them in the past. Domestic sales combined with any type of new tax package will help propel the profitability to all new heights."
McCormick is down 5.31% to 138.82
"Ex Pinnacle Foods/ ConAgra shareholder, now a MKC shareholder.I owned Pinnacle shares for about 6 years & they performed incredibly well. Unfortunately they were swallowed up by ConAgra about 1.5 months ago. My 'new' ConAgra shares were already down over 16.00% as of today. The only good thing is that a large portion of the deal was cash.Earlier today, I sold the CAG shares & invested the proceeds in MKC.Hopefully, over time, that turns out to be a smart move."
"Out MKC at $166.00 for a very nice gain of $2,330.00 in less than 24 hours. :-) I think she will go up more today, and good luck to all the Longs, but I am off on a new Earnings Adventure for this afternoon..."
"Earnings are out, looking pretty good to me, beat by .17 cents and raising guidance Blast off in progress..."
MKC reached a new All Time High at 112.60
"Earnings Tomorrow. Good luck everyone. Start to see some news on how the French's/Frank's integration is panning out alongside the new products they released over the past quarter. Most important as well is to see the effect of the lower tax rates on their domestic business considering the heft of US sales from French's/Franks/ Cattleman's and several other small brands picked up over the past few quarters: Stubb's especially, but also the industrial side operations. If tax reform gives them a cashflow tailwind, they might be able to pay down the debt load a little faster or get enough extra cash to grab a few smaller bolt-on's a few quarters earlier than anticipated. E-commerce is the one sticking point to make sure we are getting along with Amazon still. Management was quick to point out the profitable relationship with Amazon after the Whole Foods acquisition. Hopefully this has continued to blossom and we will see some opportunities for increased shelf-space in those locations. I still see this company as one of the few grocery/food names that has longevity considering the low-sodium, healthy, cost-efficiency nature of their products, in addition to their ability to produce ingredients when eating outside the home as well as for bringing home to your local pantry. Hopefully they will continue to have positive things to say-- I can't imagine the past few months of increasingly strong consumer sentiment counting against them during the holidays. Best! -Dan"
"Spicy Samuel? Spicy Steve? Do you all think that we could get this spice raft to go all the way up to the $170s? I do. I use McKormick spices all day long, at work, at home, at church events, at the local VFW, I even bring several of my favorite spices in the car, just in case I am traveling and need spices. This company is pushing all boundaries of spice infusion into the broader marketplace. I even think they might get into the pot space, by offering spicy versions of hemp processed into cbd spices and flavorings. Any thoughts? Should be trading at 40-50x FCF, not just 30x. These aren't just spices, they are necesseties of daily life in the 21st c. Rule the world with spice."

Going down after this news?? I'll just add more but this market is such a damn joke in 2020 it's ridiculous.
"Boom Boom, MKC smashes through $167! I'm already out, but love to see traders and investors riding a bull up. Would be extra cool if she managed to break her 52 week high of $171.10, today. A bit of a stretch IMO, but not beyond the realm of reasonable possibility. Fatten those wallets, you longs! :-)"

It will correct some. They always do after a split. Patience and then add more
We should be headed up from here god willing

Is it just me or Yahoo Finance did not update user portfolio data to reflect MKC stock split?
Stay at home schooling. Does that mean more or less PBJ sandwiches?
Cramer has flip-flopped on McCormick like 4 times now
Back within 5$ of its 52-week high already. Amazing
Exdividend next week. Buy now
this is a buy for the split
The AARP version of a pump and dump. Just Kidding: looks like a great long term play
"The more the restaurants open, the better for mkc business, I suspect. I wonder, however, what the net change will be during this winter due to (a) more restaurant openings (maybe), but (b) colder weather that will keep more people from dining out?"
Up or down for earnings?

"Sell? Why? Spices are essential and highly profitable commodity in these uncertain times. Could you imagine how much money powdered Tumeric, or Cayenne pepper, or Salt will be worth when China goes to war with India in the South China Sea? MKC stock is possibly worth more than Rent a Center, Sketchers, and Ollies combined! Might one day be worth as much as Coke! Yeah sell to me! Dummies. Trust me, you'll wish you were buying as much shares as me, the big boys, and the McKormic Company themselves. Price gonna be too expensive for your grubby, spiceless hands when it moves over $225 region."
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Multistockalerts.com) check them out today.
"Spicy PEOPLE! This stock is going straight to $200 without stopping for more pepper. Take spices with you everywhere! Eat spices on your food, or in your beverage and you will not only be healthier, but richer for owning spicy shares of MKC! This is how the spice road was built folks, hard work and spices and lots of money! We got this saffron injection! Yeah!"
Tomorrow we get 2-1
does this stock get effected by trade war?
52 wk high in this current climate....I love it.
I only wish split make this to go like TSLA and AAPL and screw shorts big time Morons
Nobody is worried about the drop premarket on earnings ? I was never in this but bought this morning ???I didn't expect such a big drop !!!

"And here is another joke of the day,(MKC) after 9 weeks of trading and over 40 million shares trading hands ( fake or no fake) we are back to square one it's called (Gringo's game) Booyah. Yo-Yo."
"Mkc is a great long term, safe position. Excellent for institutions and smart, thoughtful investors. The company has good, well-positioned and sustainable products, a strong track record, and effective, proven management. What more could a long term or even short term conservative investor reasonably ask for? The results of my strategy for mkc has resulted in my holdings of this position being disproportionately high in my portfolio. We should all have such problems!"
"Bouncy, Bouncy - long time, long term investor but lately this stock reminds me of the old Bobby Vee song.And like a rubber ball, I come bouncing back to youRubber ball, I come bouncing back to youWhat gives??"
"This stock is like taking a wrong turn on the Pennsylvania turnpike, it will be a long time before finding an exit to make a U-turn."
"Surprising that the short ratio in MKC is higher than I would have thought. Institutional ownership is high, almost 90%, and the business seems reliable and on a good track. I don’t understand why there would be higher short positions."
"If you want to be in the market in this rough time and what you want is a good company in which to invest, this is a good choice. 2020 will be a strange one for the history books for most companies, some much more than others. This one will be in the less affected."
"This morning’s drop — not-smart trade is my guess. I’m guessing that one holder of a large amount, like 50,000 shares or so, decided to cash out (probably because of big gains) simply unloaded instead of exiting methodically. MKC has been a great performing company. The stock trades in a relatively low volume, so any big market trade, whether a buy or sell, is going to impact the price immediately. A more thoughtful, patient seller would not have moved the market by 2% with a one time dump. That said, my guess is that the price will move back to its steadier level in a fairly short time. If that’s closer to $170, some buyers will be in for a gift."
Why the ore-market and opening swings today?
MKC reached a new All Time High at 119.36
"Not looking too good for KHC today. I hope MKC can continue its appeal with customers to prevent us from having to share that same fate. We had a hiccup quarter and stock decline, but nothing like what they are going through over there."
MKC reached a new All Time High at $150.19
"Performance has been strong and smart. Company demonstrates soundness, consistently, reliability. Shorts have finally given up-down to 1.91% from 6%+ in the past 12 months...strange."
"Looking for news/info why the drop and seeming weakness in stock price. Haven’t found any. Based on reports, business is solid and management is effective. I wonder—is it the small market cap? Is it the solid, sound, but not hyper upside potential that makes the stock performance weaker?"
"Honestly, how long can you keep this gem down?"
MKC is down 6.29% to 132.15
"I plan on holding MKC for the long term, but if there was ever a stock that made sense for Buffet's Berkshire portfolio, it's MKC. With that said, the deal would likely be pursued by Kraft Heinz which Buffett owns close to 30% of. I hope it doesn't happen, but I think it could at some point. I wouldn't mind Buffett purchasing outright, but have no interest being under the Kraft Heinz (KHC) umbrella."
McCormick reached an all time high at 209.34
"Point of concern--- added interest expense hindering net income growth post-acquisition. Okay, running through numbers on the SEC filing for pro forma 2016 and first 6 months of 2017 on the combined entity shows some incredible strength in the acquire company/assets. R&B Food Company is showing a return on equity of 32.45% for 2016 which is higher than MKC. Good prospects on added revenue growth and net income growth as well, coupled with the anticipated and forecasted cost synergies by 2020 (I'm guessing R&B back office people are going to be targeted to retain as much on the commodity sourcing, IT, sales support, etc. at MKC HQ). Cost of goods should also drop as they will be able to leverage the significant increase in bulk purchasing/sourcing of raw goods for the combined company (I'm thinking capsicums, mustard seed, tomato products, vinegar, onions, garlic, salt, etc). The main complaint and negative that I can find comes down to the increased interest expense on the debt and their use of variable rate term loans for roughly $1.5 billion of the financing split evenly between 3 and 5 year structures. The remaining financing ($2.5 billion) comes through fixed-rate notes offered in 5, 7, 10, and 30 year issues. These will become fixed expenses for the duration and are predictable. I am baffled over the use of the variable rate term loans for the first portion especially in this environment where it is nearly guaranteed that rates will head higher if not in the next year then certainly in the next 3-5. This posses a serious handicap on future earnings as any benefit from increased volume/mix/margins could actually be moving in lockstep with increasing rates and higher interest payments. Granted, the full year 2017 results might come through at higher run rates and mute the impact somewhat. Further, under MKC leadership the added brands will have significantly expanded sales channels to global customers (though this adds back increased FX headwinds). If MKC can get enough traction and drive sales growth on this new asset, they could get the entire company back onto the higher growth trajectory. This would provide enough free cash to pay off the term loans and reduce their interest expense drag by potentially $46 million for full pay-off at the starting interest rates (750 at 2.9% and 750 at 3.25%).The numbers still make sense. The added EPS growth will come from them shifting excess cash from buybacks (which they have already announced) and toward the repayment of these term loans. Added back $46million to the bottom line on 133.3 million shares out following the secondary adds $0.34 to EPS ($8.16 to the share price at 24x)."
"Come on folks, it's time to wake up to the good news, MKC is taking off, don't miss the rocket to @166... :-)"

"Nothing wrong with MKC look at their 10 and 20 yr charts. This company for the most part beats earnings and its a consumer product everyone buys and has in their kitchens. so don't fret buy on dips. Buy, Buy Buy!"
some of these sales happen because government makes you sell if it's part of 401k the older you get the more they make you sell every year .reason 1 so you don't leave it to someone. reason 2 so they can take taxes on it
Missed the boat on this one.

“Pre-market”
"This is a great long term investment with low level risk. The company’s operations are steady and ever improving, and they make strategic acquisitions at a very deliberate pace. Hence, they will deliver nice to very nice results on a pretty consistent basis. They will not be an AÍ or overnight wonder, so those traders will stay away from this."
nice call dimmy dim wit Cramer
Acting horrendous the last 2 weeks. Now below when they announced stock split.
It’s frustrating to see the stock price languish so long.
