SAM is now highly undervalued.
"SAM's brand new ""Hard Mtn Dew"" + ""Cannabis infused drink"" partnership will push SAM aboe others drowning in the seltzer battle/stuggle... Both these bumps just announced within past 4 weeks. I'm ADDding at these temporary 52w lows.."
"well, you all saw it; near term double bottom around 620. could be a positive going forward at least up to 710-720 before re-testing again; just a guess. However, worth putting in for a few shares."
"still high, SAM should be under $250 per share! Still can make $$$ from buying a PUT ($500/Exp. Oct 15)"
A buddy of mine at work bought 22 $720 calls today.
"When it misses this quarter...and it'll miss big as sure as the sun rises, this thing is going down to 250"
50% dip since April? Over Seltzer’s?
"This analyst, Vivien Azer, that just downgraded SAM; she says Constellation Brands is a better stock to go with. Well, I would sure stay away from that stock. For those of you that stick with SAM, long term, and buy more shares if they get cheaper....you are going to do fine."
"WOW!! The ambulance chasers are circling poor old SAM. Look at all the different class actions by all the law firms. The only entity that smells blood in the water better than a shark is a lawyer. Poor old SAM laying out there in the water like a wounded right whale. Getting close to a buy opportunity in SAM. Not yet, but soon maybe. The sharks haven't bitten enough off the whale just yet. This is setting up to be a good long term investment opportunity, but do not expect to ever see this stock hit $1000 again. Those days are over for good IMHO. However, I still love Sam Adams beers. SAM will recover."
Man this stock seems like it splits every month...
feels like dilution
that 510 low has got to hold first. we all know that it will have to be re-tested. we have to let patience determine that bottom for us. just saying.........
"new lows almost every day, but beautiful company. Will succed in time"
"The slow burn continues, and will continue. No one believed me two months ago, believe me yet? Or just keep losing money, while I make it. Thanks!"
There was a dip yesterday with increased volume and the price is almost flat now with almost no volume at all. This is a good sign in my book. I bought some yesterday and the day before. If it stays above my average for at least a week I will start buying more. Upside looks good.
No bottom in sight!
You shoulda got out with that little spike now it'll defly go below 5...defly
Values are still high
Where is the bottom?
Is it a crash or just reversion to normal EPS level? Share price is still soundly above level of pre-covid.
"Best time to buy this stock. It will keep going up from here. By Christmas, the PPS will be in 4 digits."
"reasons to be bullish: no debt, new products in the pipeline, seltzer hasn't matured...yet, mtn dew/beam partnership revenue hasn't been priced into forecasted sales"
"Looks like SAM is waking up. Someone said, “ how about a Can O Bus beer”. SAM opened his eyes and said, “I’ll drink to that”"
"After all the damage they've done to investors , they should do a buy back and reduce the damage done to investors. This should be a minimum."
How low is this one going to go?
Added 75 more at $557.81…

Target $300
"Further downside coming, best position are puts."
"BEWARE of TD Ameritrade. They have been consistently stealing money from my account and will not provide an explanation. After opening 3 tickets with TD, not one of the reps can explain this at all. DO NOT USE TD AMERITRADE, unless you want higher fees than any other broker and have them skim money off the top daily without you noticing. They do not even post all the fees on your statement, only deduct from your account. How is THIS legal? It's time for a #TDAMERITRADE class action lawsuit. Don't believe me, Google TD Ameritrade bad reviews and you'll find multiple people complaining of same issues of TD stealing their money. Google it!"
"Is this an undersell like Koch has been known for through the years? Oktoberfest is stacked everywhere and seems to be moving quickly, though it's in many ads so the margins may take a hit. Is this just a Midwest thing or is Sam stacked on floors and in ads all around the country?"
Sorry to say...but the plummet will continue until your in the 3's. Thats what you get for investing in something that tastes like alka selzer...
"let it find a bottom first and then re-visit that low a few times so the rollover of shareholders has fully taken place. the lawsuits, revised earnings forecasts, etc. are all part of the bottoming process. It has to at least visit 510 again and hold it. IMHO don't buy yet until that low has been re-visited."
Wait someone bought this at 1000? A beer company? Read up on PE ratio. LOL.
SAM will be fine long term. They are clearly a great company. They have been around since 1984. My hope is that their leadership will make the right adjustments for sustainability and profitability.
I bought this at $1200 a share this is disaster
"Serious problems with management decisions and guidanceThree hundred is coming here.No volume, lack of interestCases backed up at alarming levelsSingles doing okBut they did not want to prepare for those.Nope they wanted to flood the block with pallets and pallets of ovOverpriced not selling cases.Overestimated earnings by a mile.BuddahBlood bath nowhere near done here."
Glad I sold SAM at $1345.50#$%$ was looking frothy to me......will look to git back in around $390/sh.....earinngs earnings earnings
"Market correction underway. If you just got in, bounce before it goes lower"
"If you're still short this name, you're as delusional as the people buying at $1300.If for no other reason, this is due for a technical relief rally BIG TIME. It can't be more oversold on the daily.See you at $700 by next month. If you want to argue it will continue from there to $300 or whatever, OK. But this is not dying straight down into oblivion. They never do.Way better short entries in the month ahead, stop being stupid."
Glad I got out. Put too much money into Feminine hygiene drinks and not focusing on what got them to their market capitalization at its peak in the first place..... Beer
"any update with the beam partnership, spiked soda WILL be the next trend, especially those at home watching football this season!"
"wow simple message and you guys don't understand it.Are you robinhooders? your investing and no nothing about inventory, ordering or the selection of variety selection, cases from singles?The different price points of purchase.How different people within different levels of society can afford dofferent things but some still purchase the finer things as a choice when they can.S e k t o r drives a cts v or the AudiBuddah drives a new camry but owns a lamborghini gallardo lime green for funsee the difference?Maybe you get thisrather hand a truly can to a chick than a twisyed tea can for image only or to set the status.Not going to buy an entire case of truly for her because the store cannot stock truly singles or order them in.Thar is not Sektor's problem....he has enoughbut that could take your ceo 6 to 9 months to straighten outchanging inventory shipping and delivery selection choices on cases and singlesalready a massive over case supplyyou hooders think they correct and fix that within 6 monthsno chance in lucid coconut, lucid creek nikola land twin of that jappening.your ceo was so far off on last earnimgs estimateshe completely lost control of the case versus singlesdebacleor he was in on ityou better fugure out which onebad as the sndl ceoor nept disasters e k t o ra R O B I N H O O D E R S P R E A C H E R"
So pre-covid it was a $350-400 stock. Still way up on a 2 year chart…. What’s all the wringing of hands about??
I bought 209 shares at $554.89.. got a tight stop on these.
Nice recovery! Let’s see if we can stay green. Today might be the start of a rally to $700. I got my dry powder ready.
This pepsi partnership smells like they’re testing the water too see if SAM is a potential buyout. I can see either Pepsi or Cocacola buying them out as these companies are looking to reduce exposure to sugary drinks and expand their product lines by means of liquor products. I predict a buyout in the next 5 years
Its dropped $750 thus far...and its giving back 1 penny after hoursThats classic
Anyone who thought this was worth 75 times earnings needs stay on the farm drinking beer and not trying to do their own investing. LMAO.
target $300
"wow from 1,300(April) to 500. Going to 250 for sure."
WONDER IF THE GUYS AT DOGFISH ARE PLEASED WITH THEIR ALL STOCK BUYOUT AT $1200 A SHARE. IT'S ONLY DOWN $700. WOW!
"If you Bought and held from June 2020, no profit. I would not be surprised if this heads back to 400 level. You will not see similar growth 2022."
Time to start buying. Solid name in beer. Better than tap and bud. Higher margins. More pricing power
Here come new lows.. I bought 5- $500 puts !
Sam i am...warned you long ago. What are the chances that 520 is the exact bottom after falling from 1300? Zero chance...don't buy in
Closed my $SAM position for a day trade. Out at $524. Will look to reenter.
Its recovered really well.
The analyst at Cohen that downgraded SAM today was merely attempting to push prices lower so that his fund managers could buy this stock at fire sale prices. This stock is almost 60 percent off the highs and still has strong growth prospects over the long term. This stock is getting priced as if its on its way to bankruptcy. The time to buy is now!!!!!
I bought 8–$510 calls at $725… sold at $1655…. Thanks SAM !!
"A few thoughts on the matter. 1) I would hate to sell tomorrow because Peter Lynch argues that when an investor sells in desperation they always sell cheap. 2)However, on the other hand the fundamentals are rapidly deteriorating. 3) Morningstar is putting these shares under review, that is definitely not good."
See you next year at low 400$.
Those who are selling have already sold and those who want to buy are too scared to buy. I'm guessing we float sideways until the market catches up with SAMs fair value.
"This is the result when you have a CEO who for 40 strait days sells off 2500 shares per day before a bad earnings report. I have lost complete confidence in this management team. Wish I never bought this stock, in fact I think I'll start drinking another brand."
Bottom?
I bought 376 at $509.75…looking forward a $15-$20 scalp !!
Awwwww FUD!

"Bought call this morning, got 165% up"
Big slowdown after notmalcy. $200-250 be OK to take take chance.
I remember when I owned this at $25 a share and sold when it doubled. Still looks pricy to me!
"isn't this similar to Tesla stock booming in 2020 and then floating back to reality for 2021? 500 still seems high for a stock that trends up and floats down historically. maybe this was a long run setup? I want to get in, but I haven't done the homework on this yet."
It is A D T X. About to pop and start it's SAVA long runup over 100Buddah thinks its the exact same guys amd mm'sSektor
Takes $800 off the top and then gives back a buck...almost makes you wanna start drinking. Yeah that's it...maybe thats their master plan to increase sales
JUST BOUGHT IN AT $556/share! Very Bullish on this company with a drop of over 50% and 2 new innovative products coming out next year I feel this is a great investment. Here is my full bullish thesis! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h08L3cfrMw&t=13s
All the naysayers were wrong. There was way too much pessimism on this board. I bought at 502.
Load up on the oct 15 $600 PUTS now
"Do people read anymore ? Or just fire off belches on social media ? SAM just got a giant big brother with his own delivery wagons. ' PEP and Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer are teaming up to create an alcoholic version of Mountain Dew.Boston Beer will develop and produce the drink, called Hard Mtn Dew, while Pepsi has created a new entity to sell, deliver and market the product. The beverage is expected to hit shelves in early 2022.Hard Mtn Dew will belong to the flavored malt beverage category and contain 5% alcohol by volume. Early images of the products also show that it will contain zero sugar.The first hint that Pepsi could enter the alcohol category came in October, when Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts the company would consider the move.' PEP market cap = $214 BillionSAM market cap = $6.6 BillionGee, what could happen here ?"
not buying for more than $450
You have to think so investors or analyst trust the management of this company when they raised guidance and now today the news of the revenue miss just a few months later. I think what comes next is for the board to remove and chop heads. Someone will pay for this miss guidance
Bought back in at 518.58. Missed the 515.16 bounce. if can turn R2G could be a buy signal. Volume low low low. RSI still oversold.
Its a shame this stock ain't goin anywhere anymore...low 5's till the bottom drops out again
"One thing I learned for the past year about the analysts covering liquor sector based on the questions they ask of the management and those who just fawn and try to flatter the management. Vivian Azer is the best analyst- she challenged SAM management on the last 2 calls about their estimates. she didn't raise her estimates while others were because she was doing her actual ""analysis"" rather than taking management's word for the prospects. all other are buffoons especially the guy from Evercore ISI and another French guy (forgot which company he is from) are complwte stooges. they just keep congratulating the management and tried to ask questions so that management could say something positive- e.g. dogfish or some other brand had some non alcoholic beer and management kind of brushed it aside but he kept pushing and finally management said yes we can decide to go that path - we have a lot of options blah blah. that tells the state of analysts whose only job is to raise target price based on what management is saying and not putting any of their own thought or rrasoning. sad.."
Mountain dew is incredibly popular world wide. An alcohol version of it will greatly improve the outlook
"Abandon ship, abandon ship."
"Morningstar analyst Nicholas Johnson is more bullish, putting fair value at $1,020 for Boston Beer.“The firm has shown a remarkable proclivity to not only augment its portfolio in alignment with the latest growth vectors, but to also capture a disproportionate share of the economic rents generated from this growth by being one of the first movers,” he wrote last month."
Up nice on great volume !! I bought calls today and now out !!
"Crash and burn! $300 is real value, down arrow bedwetters! Been saying it for months!"
So a 0.4% decline in Seltzer’s is why it’s down. No one is drinking seltzer’s anymore. Hmmm bot me. I buy 10 cases a month lol . And everywhere I go people are drinking seltzer’s. Especially the ones who have been gaining weight over the pandemic lol
"SAM: 8/31/2021 here we go !If SAM gets a big celebrity (Mike Tyson?!) they will boom with this new MJ product, and also seltzer... It's only when...Entourage Health Corp. (formerly WeedMD Inc.) (TSX-V:ENTG) (OTCQX:WDDMF) (FSE:4WE) (“Entourage” or the “Company”), a Canadian producer and distributor of award-winning cannabis products and brands, announced today that its subsidiary and licence holder WeedMD RX Inc. has signed agreements with BBCCC, Inc., a subsidiary of the The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE: SAM) (‘BBC’), and Ontario-based Peak Processing Solutions (‘Peak’), a subsidiary of Althea Group Holdings Ltd (ASX:AGH), to launch a new portfolio of non-alcoholic cannabis-infused beverages in Canada, with production commencing in Q4, 2021.Under the terms of the five-year development, supply, manufacturing, sales and marketing agreements, BBC and Peak will develop the beverages with Entourage’s cannabinoid-rich input biomass processed at Peak’s Windsor, Ontario facility. Entourage will be the exclusive distributor of the cannabis-infused beverages in Canada leveraging Entourage’s expansive local sales and marketing network.“The cannabis market is constantly evolving and with a growing base of consumers seeking consumption alternatives, we’re excited to partner with Boston Beer and Peak to elevate our offerings with Canadian-made, cannabis-infused beverages developed by one of North America’s most iconic craft beer brands,” said George Scorsis, Interim CEO and Executive Chair of Entourage. “We are proud to expand into another consumer vertical with award-winning partners of well-known products that will focus on all segments including the emerging self-care market. Our collective industry expertise coupled with extensive cannabis research and advanced branding strategies will lay the foundation for new product collaborations and further market expansion opportunities at scale. Our strong industry presence, sales force and reputation for consistently delivering award-winning brands in Canada makes this an ideal collaboration.”""Since the early days of medical access, Entourage has cultivated accessible, quality-produced cannabis that is considered a benchmark in a regulated market – and they truly exemplify what we look for in our suppliers,” said Paul Weaver, Head of Cannabis at BBCCC Inc. “This partnership is further strengthened by Peak Processing Solutions, with the talent and systems in place to ensure every drink is prepared with the highest care and excellence. We are excited to work with Entourage and Peak to bring best-in-class beverages to Canadian consumers.”Peak Founder and President, Gregg Battersby added: “The team at Peak are delighted to partner with two industry leaders in Entourage Health and The Boston Beer Company to develop what promises to be an exciting range of cannabis-infused beverages. This collaboration is further validation of Peak’s significant and unique capabilities in the Cannabis 2.0 space, and the latest in a growing list of strategic and innovative partnerships.”Cannabis Beverage MarketThe Cannabis 2.0 market represents a strategic market opportunity given that products within the category yield a substantial price premium in the Canadian adult-use market compared to dried flower and cannabis oils (Reference: Nurturing New Growth; Canada Gets Ready for Cannabis 2.0, Deloitte). Cannabis beverages are also appealing to new-to-cannabis consumers as an alternative to traditional alcohol beverages, many of whom are also using the products for self-care or wellness reasons."""
This has to be the worst collapse in the history of collapses in such a short period. Who’s been holding throughout this ?
"Another day another 52 week low. Stocks dont go down this much for so long unless large shareholders are dumping. Little by little, day by day with a few headfakes here and there to make it look legit. Even with states starting to implement covid prevention measures which you would think benefits SAM, the stock keeps going down. Only explanation is large or insider shareholders are dumping"
"You're getting a plethora of chances to get out before this thing plunges thru 500, and make no mistake about it, the amount of stop loss orders @ 500 is going to be epic"
Thinking about starting up an investment in SAM. I’m thinking it’s oversold right now and will rebound over next year or so. Thoughts?
Downgrade on what everyone already knew? This was priced in long time ago.
Mr Koch has been selling weekly since SEPT 2019 all his stock ... at a LOW of $319 back then and up to over $920 a share a few months back and keeps selling on the downslide we are now seeing. ... he must have ben given a life threatening diagnosis to act this way with a company he started and built. I expect this stock to keep dropping to $300. Institutions are selling too ... https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sam/insider-activity
The 6 month decline continues. There may not be a bottom until $375/shr is realized.
The pessimism abounds for this equity. The market appears to be pricing in an absolute worst case scenario where not only will sales slow but actually decline. If this continues to fall I will soon start buying aggressively.
DOWN 35 after hours
"First positive day in awhile. I picked up some more shares… if we can end the week on a positively, it’s time to buy in a big way. If $SAM could make hard seltzer a success, I am sure they could make cannabis drinks as well. GLTA"
Been watching this stock since the 700… never bank on the jumps in this. Puts all day
"Still plummeting on an Up day, even after losing 60% off the top...is defly not a good sign...defly"
Every stock in the market is up today but Sam i am...
"Why the selling? Because some ditz analyst says downgrade to $400? The same analyst who said buy SAM last August with a $1,000 PT, and then upped her price target to $1,300 end of April of this year? Right. Me better do what ditz analyst says. Me buy at $87O and at $1300 cuz ditz analyst said it was good deal. Now I must sell shares at $600. Me good investor like ditz analyst"
"If one took away forecasts and stock price and only looked at how well the company is performing, you would look at the financials and be like, this company is growing at a good clip and notched it’s best ever revenues last quarter. Looks like a good investment. Ignore the noise, 50% upside, 10% downside at these levels"
the PE is still high even at 500. just goes to show you how overvalued this thing was. More pain in store.
Buy this during tax loss selling.

Looking for a buyout or merger. Company oversold. RSI about 15-17. Went long at 515.9. No real consolidation yet. Holding above 510.
This is not oversold...its undersold. Wickedly bad management that doesn't know the business. Heading $300-400 before all settles.

Been watching this stock and I like it at $700 looking even better now...dip in a pinky toe Monday perhaps
Short interest is up to 14.07% !!
Ok so seltzer sales slowing down?? What are people drinking - beer?? Doesn’t SAM sell beer?!?
Boston Beer (SAM) to partner with PEPSI to make alcoholic drinks.This is incredible news. Pepsi is a global giant.
"Management is continuing to be taken to woodshed for misguiding analysts so badly. SAM gets daily cash register Point of Sale data from 100’s of large retailers that even with a junior statistical analyst could predict with 99% accuracy of what sales will be. With that said, the woodshed beating will end at some point and stock moves back to $700 range. Ps they BETTER Guide next QTR 100% correctly"
back down we go! lol that was called flippers yesterday
Will have to wait until the end of the day to see if this is a true reversal - but looking good. Hope everyone has some money ready to buy some SAM
"Lower volume, lowest close since 5/11/2020. Couldn’t retake yesterdays high. Not consolidating yet. No trade today."
It's dropped y 50%. Any logical investment strategy would point to buying low NOW.
Will go back to 490
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"SAM's could be the most deadly ""Falling Knife"" ever recorded!The bodies are mounting up!"
Patience is the key… will be interesting to see if the buying starts next week.
Painful
Guess the decelerating sales are worst than we thought.
Im surprised there aren't any lawsuits.
Thank God the CEO sold all his shares a couple of months ago when he saw the numbers or he would have taken a big loss too!!
With an rsi of 17 does anyone think this is a buying opportunity?
DUI the Dew!
Interesting to find out if the company will buy back any of its shares around these levels.
Every great investor I have ever read suggested not to put to much weight on one quarter. Last quarters earnings weren't even bad just worse than previous guidance. This selloff seems way over the top.
"I'm guessing the next Q report , early Dec. will be the wash out quarter in conjunction with tax loss selling with mgmt hoping to cleanse themselves of this debacle along with selling pressure. Will be an interesting time, will keep this on radar for a mid December buy look. The question is can they get rid of the stink in 1 Q, or will it roll into next year?"
The slow burn back to a fair valuation....I called it 2 months ago. Down arrow away bedwetters!
Don't believe me on the slow burn back to normal yet?
"Bloomberg: ""The average price target for Boston Beer has dropped to $907, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which is the lowest it has been since Oct. 21.

"I remember when Sam Adams Boston Lager was released. I loved it. Today, it doesn't taste the same. There is so much competition from the micro and macro breweries selling great beers. The big boys are definitely struggling."
Unfortunately more downside seems in the cards for SAM. Bottom will come when all the bulls have given up. That may take a while since I see there are still those anticipating a near term bounce higher.
Substantial selling in between block buys this might be the bottom.
SAM should name a beer … Sellers RED !!
Why no share split
"Days like this, I always go back to my Morningstar to read up this company instead of the recent TP moves by sell-side analysts. At least Morningstar is not incentivized to make their subscribers buy or sell. My only lament is it's not going down to my next by point to average down"
Too many seltzers. Truly has been left in the dust.
"LAWSUITSThe case alleges that Boston Beer and its senior executives made misleading statements to investors and failed to disclose that: (i) Boston Beer's hard seltzer sales were decelerating; (ii) as a result, Boston Beer was reasonably likely to incur inventory write-offs; (iii) Boston Beer was reasonably likely to incur shortfall fees payable to third party brewers; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, Boston Beer's financial results would be adversely impacted."
This has become a multi year thesis. Let's hope the $SAM management regain their MOJO and lead with new exciting products
Stock was 300 in March 2020. Only a little over a year ago. Should revisit that 300.
Apparently no barriers to entry in the seltzer market Saw ads for 5 new ones over this weekend
Go to any liquor store and ask them about Boston Beer products. They will tell you its doing great.
"Green amongst the sea of red. Could his be the reversal? If we have another day or two if green, that will be confirmation to load up the truck."
"Tell you what happened, but it's so obvious...sam was first as you remember with the seltzer. They had biginners luck as the young women wanted to try what was new. Then all the competition launched, over 100 different companies about 500 to 800 flavors.Well that competition caught up. New liqor stores need 20 coolers to put in all the new choices, flavors and varietirs.Now combine that with the ovetsupply of cases and sam not going enough into singlesJust as deep as the cases.Then like seltzers attacked samThe hard tea makers are attacking sam alsoSo many new ones and some of them good.Sam ceo could not have misdef earnings by a margin that wide unless its the end of their easy ride bubbleAnd because of thst he lost all contriolNow seltzer is slowing a lot and teas are coming on strongStronf enough pepsi saw the next big thing is hsrd soda's3 mountsn dew hard sodas from pepsiThing is pepsi id trying to pay coke bsckFor beating them on the energy drinksEven though pepsi bought red bullIt did not help them compete with a regular pepsi energy drinkPepsi should have bought out ref bull and bangThat will come back to hsunt them because laterThose bang flavors could have been made into hard tea or hsrd fruit flavor seltzer selections.Or that strawberry bang could have been both a thc and alcohol flavorHsd the taste to overpowet them all.So much of tjis has been caused by old people not able to move right because our lying f e d s wont let the doctors write even half or a quarter what they use toWr have known the truth how long nowChina fentsnyl and cartel h killed all those kids because they wouldnt write opiatrsOpiates themselves like 2% of all deaths..and even those had othet things in them xanax bars etc."
SAM never ever deserved to be at 1300/share. Now it is at 500/share. Its overvalued according to legendary investor Bala Thakrey.
The management should reassure investors by doing a buy back
"downgraded a month after bad earnings lol they're loading up, I don't own any btw"
"Octoberfest is my favorite beer, I am supporting SAM as much as I can without ""over indulging"". Thank god I don't own the stock.......yet."
Buy SAM for 2 years. And get a very attractive return!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I highly recommend SAM.
"It?s reaching the bottom. Once we see a reversal, start pouncing and buy the #$%$ out of this. We are heading back to $700 or more for sure. Just need to wait for the reversal."
koch sold in the $1200 range..what a joke
"Drink SAM, don't invest in it"
SAM has bottomed! It will be up from here. Back over $600 before end of October.
End of October will bring higher stock price. Seasonal uptrend will benefit SAM.
$300 target
"I told you how to play this until the trend breaks…. BUY at the close…. SELL the pop in the first 30-45 minutes…. Short the pop,,, cover at the close…"
"I’m only looking for quick scalps with SAM, otherwise I’m playing PUTS longer term."
"That price target is based on a PE of 20. The fair value PE of SAM. So buying between TTM 20 PE and forward 20 PE is a good position in my point of view. Also, after a fall like this the stock will need time to recover."
They had some interesting insights about SAM on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Last Wednesday Sam was at $562 when they retracted their guidance. Sam fell to the $510 range, today we had a pop back over Wednesdays close but couldn’t hold the gains. Again I have stated this is a great trading stock, buy at the close shares or calls, sell after the first or second wave of morning buying. Then sell or buy Puts ! Wash rinse repeat !!! Make  !!"
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"this stock was just early this year I'm the 1000s..this company should do well when the earnings report comes out ,.. or no?"
Close your eyes and sell SAM. It will be at 400 tomorrow.
"SAM won’t hold these gains, Shorts are covering and taking some profits !! SAM will close in the low $620’s if not the $590-range !"
"What I truly liked about today’s action was how SAM hit a low of $562.11 and bounced to the $575 level, and held. The 3 moves to the $585 level, but held $570 again and showed strength into the close. If $570 holds tomorrow..$600’s should come soon."
"Yahoo's chart describes the pattern for SAM as ""bullish"". LOLROF"
PepsiCo CEO said good relationship with SAM and see’s nice distribution growth in an estimated $9 billion segment
"at target last night, octoberfest sitting front and center as you walk in:)"
"Seltzer is 100% an important part of their business and it will still grow, although not as fast as the summer of '19 to now, anyhow, we Bulls have A LOT to be thankful for CBD/THC beer, Mtn Dew Beer, all the craft beers that SAM has and whatever else they serve up on deck LongDrink/mixed premades. Let's be honest people drink when the times are good and really drink when the times are bad. Not going to lie this SUCKS and I wish that I had more dinero to load the truck with but sometimes we get taken behind the shed. We'll live to fight another day, glta."
Wicked Hazy is terrific. Nothing wrong on the beer front except that there is a lot of competition out there. Seltzer has lost its fizz for good. Will be a niche product like the Twisted Tea. 500 is looking like the new reality for SAM shares for the next year.
In at 517 this is easy 700 + in 3-4 months.
They have overpriced beer that is okay but they have way to many seasonal brews that cost too much and aren't even any good. Get back to basics.
PE and PEG look too high compared to peers
It seems like a large fund is exiting their position on SAM. The consistent selling doest stop and usually that is due to large shareholders dumping. We will find out sooner or later who it is
"SAM will more likely trend lower until earnings. The charts were looking really good. Still ok, the 9-day has not crossed the 20- day but close. If so new lows are on the way !"
I originally bought in at $10/share. I'm good with today's share price
Looks like this stock will be heading down under the $350 level! The question do you sell now and take the loss and buy back at the lower level or just wait it out! The scary thing is all the law suits that will be coming.
"I am a MA resident and own both IPO shares as well buying again following the IPO market launch. I was a young small business owner when I bought my first stock Boston Beer. I do know that working for a living without investing or owning Real estate doesn't cut it financially; unless of course you are Jim Koch. The only thing I really know about the stock market is what my CPA told me in my 20's the first time I asked him why he wants me to open IRA mutual funds and not stocks. His answer was if you are going to buy stocks you should label some spots on a dart board with different stocks you like and throw the darts; and act like you are at the casino and you are not coming home with your money. Luckily I listened to him on the casino tip, and not the stocks. I aThe company's that I have purchased stock in, and either kept or sold I have done well with. I have had my loss's like when I opened my account and my Delta airline stock was gone and no money was left, and other stagnant ones that I sold and basically just lost time not making any money but didn't lose either, like Sysco foods and Harley Davidson didn't move for years. I have a couple of questions that maybe a more experienced investor could answer. The fact that:1. Jim Koch sold about $880 mil dollars worth of his shares, does this not raise insider trading RED FLAGS!!! 2. Why would such a solid company with minimal debt over shoot earning estimates by so much?3. Was it to raise the share price based on the estimates for Jim and other insiders to cash some serious money out, while my minuscule income in comparison, invested in his IPO and additional shares to get the Boston Beer company to the next level and is still there?4. After reading the news of how this happened, and the positive growth I posted below, If they had low balled their prediction and this same report came out, wouldn't the stock have risen? 5. I understand that growth companies get hit hard when they miss their mark, but the company is still solid.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE: SAM) reported second quarter 2021 net revenue of $602.8 million , an increase of $150.7 million or 33.3%, from the same period last year.5. Thoughts from long haulers sell or stay? Smells more like the Boston fishing docks than the beer garden!"
Pretty strong come back today.. a good sign
Panic selling is a thing of beauty opportunity for real investors. Made a healthy sum in a few months off of the for-no-reason DPZ sell-off this year. I feel this is going to be just as good or better.
https://www.webull.com/news/44873065Sam is too low now and market interest seems to be there. I'm buying a bit today. For the last 3 years sales have spiked due to seasonal beers like Octoberfest. I'd play it safe but seems like a good buy.
buyer at $300
Looks okay at Moving Average 200wk.... holding quite nicely.
Here we go … slowly and surely to 400$…
"Shares of Boston Beer crashed nearly 10% to $510 in pre-market trading on Thursday as the company pulled its financial guidance for the year because of brutal competition in the hard seltzer category where it competes with its Truly brand. In late July, Boston Beer stunned investors by slashing its full-year earnings outlook to $18 to $22 a share from $22 to $26, previously."
The drop that never stops...When did it split?
Wow. The bear rules. Lol
So is there a new low every day??
"That was a nice gap fill down, SAM needed that to move higher. The 9-day ma.. is about to cross the 20-day ma.. looking forward to a run to $600 -$625…"
it seems overaction. see premarket tomorrow and decide get in or not.
"This has been cut in half in 3 months, never seen something take a pounding like this over the same news bits over and over. I’m certain it’s oversold, but going to be a very long road back up. They did just post their largest revenues ever last quarter"
Has the SEC connected the dots yet so that INSIDE TRADING can be read in caps. Just saying.
"Where is the bottom? I'm looking to enter a bullish play here, but it's dramatic fall from $1300+ ATH makes me pause. Fundamentals seem solid unless there is fraud."
