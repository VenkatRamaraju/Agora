"Benzinga Aug 27 - Bitcoin Has No Value: People Bank's Of China Official Announces Further CrackdownAccording to a report by local news outlet People's Daily Online, Youping said that cryptocurrencies are purely speculative assets. He also advised the public to increase its risk awareness and stay away from the crypto market to ""protect their pockets."" The PBoC official also said in anticipation of the possible crypto market rebound and their related operations in China, the central bank will monitor overseas cryptocurrency exchanges and domestic traders in collaboration with relevant authorities.What Else: The institution also plans to crack down on the space by blocking crypto trading websites, applications, and corporate channels. Per the report, PBoC — being a member of the Joint Conference to Deal with Illegal Fund Raising — actively cooperates with the lead department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. As a result of this collaboration, the regulator created systems aiming for the monitoring, early warning, publicity, education, and overall combating of illegal fundraisings powered by cryptocurrencies and blockchains."
NIO has the absolute best EV business model there is Go long and grow rich. Just add patience
"U.S. Approves Licenses for Huawei to Buy Auto Chips By Reuters Aug. 24, 2021, - - U.S. officials have approved license applications worth hundreds of millions of dollars for China's blacklisted telecom company Huawei to buy chips for its growing auto component business, two people familiar with the matter said."
Great close.
"NIO is nowhere near ""steady state"" in its operations! Despite having 400 battery swap stations, BaaS ongoing, its first shipment of cars to Norway, and ever-increasing production numbers, it is STILL A FLEDGLING STOCK! What we're seeing is only the bow wave of the NIO business case. It is a growth stock in its early adolescent years. Once the ET7 and lower consumer-grade models hit the market, supported by a production capacity able to keep up with demand (next year when NEO park is complete), and the business case hits stride, those holding long will be rewarded handsomely. It is just a matter of time and a waiting game right now. My contempt for shorts who don't understand long-term investment horizons is matched by my contempt for ""pumpers"". Be REALISTIC in your expectations and most of all, be PATIENT!"

"China's electric vehicle manufacturers including Li Auto and NIO (NYSE:NIO) were supposed to compete with the likes of Tesla, not just there, but in markets outside of China as well. And to their credit, the country's young electric vehicle industry is making measurable progress. For instance, NIO's deliveries more than doubled year over year last quarter, driving a 127% improvement in vehicle revenue. Sure, the numbers were being compared to a COVID-19-crimped quarter, but NIO wasn't actually slowed by the pandemic. Last year's top line was still greater than 2019's, and this year's, as well as next year's, should also be up in a big way."

"We have all experienced a failing cell phone battery. There is no recourse except to purchase a new phone. With the facts below would you want a swappable battery in your EV or not? DC fast chargingA type of public charging that can charge compatible vehicles many times faster than the quickest Level 2 AC charger by feeding higher voltage DC directly to the battery pack. Tesla Superchargers are DC fast chargers.As EVs exist today, DC fast charging is best for occasional charging when time is short (e.g., when taking a long trip or running low on range). “Fast” is in the name, but EV beginners won’t find DC charging fast compared with filling a gas tank, which can provide hundreds of miles of range within a few minutes. Automakers’ DC fast-charging claims generally involve 30-minute sessions, but this seldom represents a full charge. Though automakers increasingly include some free DC fast charging with purchase of a new EV, almost all acknowledge that frequent fast charging will compromise the life of the vehicle’s battery pack. When there is a cost, fast charging is more expensive than public Level 2 charging, usually enough to eliminate the cost benefits of electric motoring with home charging. Both DC fast chargers and the three-phase AC power they require make them prohibitively expensive for home installation. The power they deliver ranges from 24 to 350 kW, but there’s no guarantee that the EV, regardless of its own acceptance specification, will charge at that rate.Nio is undertaking a gigantic task in building the infrastructure for a swappable battery. However if they are successful the rewards will be even more gigantic. Personally I'm betting on their success because recent history shows us that if China sets a goal they will eventually achieve it."

But the latest move may signal that the company is upping its bets here.NIO and Lingang Group, Shanghai's largest developer of industrial parks, signed a strategic cooperation agreement on Aug. 9 that will see the two sides collaborate on major projects, research and cutting-edge business, headquarters economy, and industrial platform establishment.William Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, and Qin Lihong, co-founder and president of the company, both attended the signing ceremony, indicating the importance the company attaches to the deal.NIO signs strategic co-op deal with Shanghai's largest industrial park developer-CnEVPost (4th from left, Qin Lihong; 5th from left, William Li)The two sides will integrate the resources of the new energy vehicle industry chain, study the model of a new energy vehicle industry guidance fund, and jointly establish a research and development center for new energy vehicle innovation and technology, according to a statement.Under the agreement, NIO will set up an R&D center at the Caohejing Science and Technology Oasis managed by Lingang Group and explore policies related to the new energy vehicle industry in the new Lingang area of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone and the industrial parks under Lingang.Shanghai is the location of NIO's global headquarters and Lingang has been supporting NIO's development for a long time and the company hopes to cooperate with Lingang in automotive intelligent R&D, Li said.The two sides will strengthen exchanges in the intelligent new energy vehicle industry chain, including chip supply, cross-border trade, service testing and talent pool, and jointly promote the development of China's intelligent new energy vehicle industry, said Yuan Guohua, chairman of Lingang Group.Lingang Group was established in 2003 and is responsible for the development and construction of Lingang Industrial Zone, investment attraction and industry introduction. It is a major driving force behind Tesla's construction of the Gigafactory in Shanghai.The company is a large state-owned enterprise group under the Shanghai Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which is mainly engaged in park development, supporting services and related industrial investment, and is the main developer of the new Lingang area in Shanghai Free Trade Zone. At present, the group's development parks gather more than 10,000 customer enterprises, including many Fortune 500 companies.In recent years, the intelligent new energy vehicle industry has accelerated in Lingang's subordinate parks, and is expected to be the first industry cluster to break through the RMB 100 billion scale among its five ""RMB 100 billion"" industries, Yuan said.At present, Lingang is serving the high-quality development of the intelligent new energy vehicle industry around investment attraction, scene creation, industry-research docking and technological innovation.The move seems to show the growing importance of local governments in China for the auto industry.Guangdong Province on Monday released its strategic emerging industries development plan for the 14th five-year plan period (2021-2025), showing that the province hopes to have its auto manufacturing revenue exceed 1.1 trillion yuan ($17 billion) by 2025 and build an auto industry cluster with international influence by then.As reported in CnEVPost late last month, central China's Anhui province, where NIO China headquarters is based, seems determined to become the Detroit of the East.The province has unveiled a three-year action plan for the development of its new energy vehicle industry, saying that by 2023 it aims to have more than 10 percent of its new energy vehicle production in China and more than 70 percent of its components available nearby."
"DONT BE SO SURE NIO IS LIMITED TO 7500 UNITS PER MONTHPursuant to the joint manufacturing arrangement, from May 2021 to May 2024, JAC will continue to manufacture the ES8, ES6, EC6, ET7 and potentially other NIO models in the pipeline. In addition, JAC will EXPAND its annual production capacity to 240,000 units (calculated based on 4,000 work hours per year) in order to meet the growing demand for NIO vehicles. NIO will be in charge of vehicle development and engineering, supply chain management, manufacturing techniques, and quality management and assurance. Jianglai will be responsible for parts assembly and operation management."

"BREAKING - US reportedly approves auto chip sale to Huawei2021-08-25 9:52:55 (GMT+8) -- US officials have approved applications for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of licenses to supply automotive chips to Huawei, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The US has authorized suppliers to supply Huawei with chips for vehicle components like video screens and sensors, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Auto chips are generally not considered sophisticated, lowering the bar for approval. One person close to the license approvals said the government is granting licenses for chips in vehicles that may have other components with 5g capability, the report said.Since the US set a chip ban on Huawei, global foundries have been unable to produce chips for its chip business, HiSilicon, in advanced processes such as 14nm, 7nm and 5nm, and foundry supplying 28nm and above mature processes also need to apply for permission from the US."

"From the conventional or technical aspects NIO has a gap to fill into the $47 to $53 range. Its beyond weird how NIO is pinned to $38. My only explanation would be that NIO sold a secondary a year ago @$38 the shares moved to $60+ in about 3 months. Then back to < $38. Back up to $50+, then back to $38. IMO the buyers of the secondary ""loaned"" the shares for short sales. That how Wall St works. The Upside ? Loaned shares are expensive and when they get called back NIO could enter a channel into $70"
Nio falling behind Xpev and Li. Li just released stellar earnings. The growth of those two companies is starting to leave Nio in the dust. All 3 companies are facing pretty much the same issues yet Nio continues to fall behind. Nio is focused more on the luxury end with nothing currently available (price wise) for the working population while the other companies have much lower priced vehicles. This fact will eventually relegate Nio to a niche brand for the wealthy which will makeup just a tiny sliver of the EV pie. Expect Xpeng and Li to flourish while Nio stays happy selling to the much smaller demographic that includes the wealthy. This stock will remain in the 25-30 dollar range for years to come.
"Because of the small free float in NIO its possible for counter-funds to sell upticks to pin the price. That strategy failed last summer and shows signs of repeating. Just like a retail day trader they have to buy back in. A fast rise locks them out and with the Battery Swap US Patent,, some early news and they can be on the wrong side of the trade"
The only Battery Swap the major oil companies will support is NIO. With the US Patent and 2 million test cases for reliability and Sinopecs endorsement.. Their own engineers and lawyers will tell them the same
"I find it quite humorous when the MM’s play the market as they demonstrated today. Why you ask? When you’re already the biggest stakeholder( retailers ) they make it easier for us to accumulate more, thus adding additional shares = still the biggest holder of all = more leverage = more upside :)"

"ReutersChina's electric vehicle makers report strong July salesAugust 2, 2021, 10:04 AM -- (Reuters) -Electric vehicle sales at China's Li Auto and Xpeng Inc more than tripled in July from a year ago, while they doubled at Nio Inc, helped by robust demand for new energy automobiles in the world's biggest auto market. Nio, the maker of the ES8 and ES6 electric sport-utility vehicles, said it delivered a total of 7,931 vehicles in July, up 124.5% from a year earlier. Deliveries had more than quadrupled in July 2020."
If you are so confident NIO is going down short it and test your luck NIO was $13 a year ago - and $60 in Feb - The funds running it down now will be pumping the #$%$ out of it to get it back to $60 as soon as they get enough shares. Truth is they may never get the shares away from retail and lose a ton of money trying. Meanwhile NIO is morphing into a trillion dollar business that may control EV power systems from A to Z
If Rivian can go public at $80B valuation (but they have no sales/production yet) so NIO fair share price at $80B is $50 per share.and they already re selling 100K electric vehicles per year

"It is not clear how many orders the agreement will bring to NIO, but its potential cannot be ignored.Why NIO?For the past few decades, the high-end cars for government departments in Beijing have been from Audi, so the brand is perceived by the Chinese public as a government car.Previously, it was reported that in 2012, 90 percent of the vehicles purchased by the government were foreign brands.

"picked up another 100 shares of NIO, more on the way as I cash out of an ETF, expecting to add about 1,200 more of NIO for the longer haul. buying under $40 is sure sweeter than those shares I bought over $60. Regardless, when I am selling them over $100 and more over $150 I will look back at the low purchase price and be happy with the lower purchase. I know, it may take a year or two or three, but that's ok, it's a waiting game before long NIO share price will be back above XPEV I expect."

In terms of charging scenario, NIO has established a ""rechargeable, battery swappable, and upgradeable"" energy replenishment system. It provides 5 types of energy replenishment methods, which are exclusive charging pile, battery swap station, mobile charging vehicle, supercharging network, and valet charging service."

"Sold my half my JD shares thst I bought during the dip and using the profit to buy HEAVIER into NIO down here at $37/38.The Chinese Goverment is clearly backing them (JAC, Sinopec deals)Tesla is fantastic but China will want a homegrown hero, they are currently in Norway and will be in the UK and Germany by 2022.The Chinese Goverment will allow Nio SOOOOOO many subsidies and grants that they will easily be the cheapest high quality EV in the world.Xpeng is a great company but its links to Alibaba actually work against it in the eyes of the CCP.BUY Nio anywhere below $40 and this time next year after they've had quarters in a profit they'll be closer to $90."
"A few nice quotes from Li Bin from Q2 earnings call : - We believe that NAD (new generation autonomous driving system) will deliver the best experience of autonomous driving and lead the charge of autonomous driving technology development in the industry.- In 2022, we plan to deliver three new products based on NIO Technology Platform 2.0, including ET7.- As I mentioned, in 2022, we're going to deliver three new products and in 2023 and beyond, probably, we're going to deliver even more products. I believe the NIO is the fastest company in the industry to deliver products to the market.- Averagely speaking, the R&D timeline for us is around two years, which is already the fastest in the auto industry. And this year, we have already kicked off many different R&D programs. - We have also stepped up our mass market entry preparation. We'll enter the mass market with a new brand.- But regarding the specific timing under the launch cadence of those products under the mass market brand we can still have time to decide. So we believe it's still too early for us to share those information for now.- Internally of course we have a very aggressive market share target by 2025. But we don't actually want to disclose this target.- We plan to increase the total number of battery-swap stations to over 700 by the end of 2021 and to over 4,000 globally by the end of 2025.- The first batch of ES8 has been shipped and expected to arrive in Norway in mid or late August to be ready for the preorder and delivery in September.- 2021 is a critical year for NIO to lay a solid foundation for its long-term development. Going forward into the second half of 2021, we will accelerate the pace of new products and full stack technology development, enhance our charging and swapping network as well as sales and the service network to be fully prepared for the delivery of the three new models in 2022.- For the global market, we believe that the more important thing is to focus on the long-term thinking, and we were delighted to ask everyone's patience in this regard.- According to the preliminary feedback we got from the Norway User Advisory Board, it seems that everyone is quite excited about the battery swapping stations and the Battery as a Service business model."
"Wow. China’s big crackdown on its technology industry is now coming for junior’s video games. Beijing will limit the amount of time children can play online to just three hours per week, dealing a body blow to the world’s largest mobile gaming market."

China Oil $ Chemical Co. have over 30,000 gas stations converting into BaaS 4). Cash and credit lines are ample for NIO's usage. 5). NIO is the highest proud to Chinese. They also have the highest quality cars in the world. 6). NIO is for sure growing fast very month, ever quarter and every year. .............................................................

The Nio ES8 SUV, the flagship Nio model, is going to Norway first"
$160 the day the first ET7 is delivered Great way to start 2022
Futures are down. Can we close in the green 
Nio began allowing Norwegian users to test drive the imported ES8 SUV in august. About 300 spots were filled within three days of application per CnEVPost.
I am thinking of selling this uptick for a tidy profit of 17.29. seventeen dollars and twenty nine cents. And You can take that to the Bank.

"CHINA Cuts EV Subsidies by 65%!ByUpdated Aug. 22, 2019 11:14 am ETChina’s electric-vehicle market is entering a new phase. The country’s largest EV maker—Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. —showcases the challenges.BYD reported Wednesday an 87% jump in net profit for the quarter through June, compared with the year-earlier period, while forecasting a 70% to 90% year-over-year drop for the current quarter. Its Hong Kong-listed stock fell 6.6% Thursday. Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns a roughly 8% stake in the company.The reason for such a big contrast between the two quarters is simple: China cut its EV subsidies in late June by at least 65%, so customers rushed to buy cars ahead of the deadline. Overall sales in China of new-energy cars, including plug-in hybrids, dropped 4.7% from a year earlier in July, the first decline in more than two years.The hangover in the world’s biggest EV market could last a while. Margins at China’s EV makers will likely be squeezed as they have to cut prices to attract buyers without the subsidies. The number of BYD EVs sitting on dealer lots doubled in the first half to nearly four times its July sales, according to Jefferies.Instead of relying on subsidies, which are expected to disappear completely by next year, Beijing hopes to encourage auto makers to produce more and better EVs with a s"

"VIE's!!! Shareholders don’t have ownership of the real Chinese company’s assets, so assets can be taken away without warning or compensation.With the news of Ant Group’s failed IPO, it is worth remembering the history of the company, which used to be called Alipay, as a perfect example of the second main risk of VIEs: that what you think you own can be taken from you at any time. Brief history lesson: Alipay/Ant Group grew up within Alibaba and became China’s largest payments processing company (think Mastercard, Visa, Paypal, and Stripe all in one). It was for many years one of the most valuable parts of Alibaba. Then, only a few short years ago in 2011, Alipay was stolen from the US and European investors in Alibaba’s VIE structure when the founder and CEO Jack Ma unilaterally transferred 100% ownership of Alipay into a different company controlled solely by himself.One of the shareholders hurt was Yahoo who were a big early investor in the Alibaba VIE, amassing a 43% stake. Yet, despite that very substantial ownership, Yahoo did not even find out about the transaction until months later. When they discovered what had happened, they were of course outraged and launched into legal proceedings.However due to the VIE structure, Yahoo (and other shareholders alongside them) were powerless to do anything. They had no legal recourse. Yahoo owned 43% of the Alibaba VIE (Fake Alibaba), so it did not technically own any portion of Alipay at all. What Yahoo legally owned was 43% of a shell corporation listed in the Cayman Islands that had some (unfortunately illegal) contracts with Alibaba. And when it came time to enforce those contracts. they were unsurprisingly unenforceable. Let us be very clear about exactly what happened: Jack Ma took a company worth billions of dollars directly from under the nose of thousands of US and European investors in the VIE, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.Yahoo were eventually given a pitiful settlement by Mr. Ma, he offered the VIE shareholders up to $6 billion when Alipay eventually IPO’d, a sum that undervalued the asset by multiples (the recent valuation was in excess of $300bn). Naturally, Yahoo shareholders were furious, and the CEO of Yahoo was fired shortly afterwards.Yet, despite this recent, brazen, and high-profile theft, along with many others like it, thousands of investors continue to invest in the Alibaba VIE to this day (currently valued at over $770bn). This is even though there is absolutely nothing preventing the same happening again. Or indeed the same at any other VIE. Thousands of Western investors continue to eagerly invest billions in the very structure that has been proved to offer them no protection in the past. Do people never learn?!"

"MF's are getting it. ""Nio: 560% implied sales growth by 2024It's no secret that electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are set up perfectly to benefit from a multi-decade replacement cycle for consumer and enterprise vehicles. Nio's (NYSE:NIO) opportunity within EVs is perhaps even more impressive given that it's based in China, the world's largest auto market.According to Wall Street, sales for Nio are expected to catapult from $2.55 billion in 2020 to $16.83 billion by 2024. For those of you keeping score at home, that's a 560% projected sales increase."""

Lets cut back to China where the largest gas station chain Sinopec has already committed to 5000 NIO swap modules by 2025.

"9:30p ET 8/6/2021 - Dow JonesEmerging Markets: China Accelerates Push Into Renewable Energy -- Barron'sMentioned: NIOBy Craig MellowChina isn't cracking down on everything. Even as Beijing reins in e-commerce and online education, it is accelerating its push into renewable energy and electric vehicles, widening a global lead in these industries of the future.That's got alert investors buying stocks like Longi Green Energy Technology (ticker: 601012.China) and Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment (300450.China) -- not household names, yet.China has been nurturing renewables and EVs for a decade. That effort took a leap last September with the country's first carbon-reduction targets: peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.""We have nearly doubled our expectations for new solar installations over the next 10 years,"" says Alex Whitworth, head of Asia-Pacific power and renewables research at consultant Wood Mackenzie. ""The level of effort has changed from all levels of society.""Beijing's macro push dovetails with microeconomics that are making electric cars and solar/wind power cost-competitive with carbon-belching incumbents, says Andrey Glukhov, an emerging markets portfolio manager at TCW. That means growth could be underestimated. ""Whatever trajectory we model has a good chance of being too conservative,"" he says.China dominates most relevant metrics, from EV sales to production of solar components. ""There are solar-farm operators all over the world, but China controls the supply chain,"" says Mubashira Bukhari Khwaja, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments.Investors have noticed. The KraneShares MSCI China Clean Technology Index exchange-traded fund (KGRN) has jumped 80% over the past year, while broader China shares are down 10%.Further gains may require more discerning stock-picking. Specialist managers are lukewarm on the biggest companies in the Clean China ETF -- EV manufacturers such as BYD (1211.Hong Kong) and Nio (NIO) -- despite July sales that are double or triple last year's figures.A crowded field promises Darwinian fallout at some point. Batteries are a different story. Chinese champion Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750. China), or CATL, owns its home market and is gaining on Korean competitors globally. ""CATL has really upped their game,"" says Vivek Tanneeru, portfolio manager for Matthews Asia ESG fund.A subsupplier to watch is Yunnan Energy New Material (002812.China), which specializes in the ""separators"" that keep batteries from short-circuiting.The sweet spot in solar is also in ""midstream"" components makers rather than power generators, which are mostly state owned, Glukhov and Khwaja agree. The Aberdeen manager favors Longi Green, the top player in solar wafers, and Sungrow Power Supply (300274.China), a market leader in inverters, which convert photovoltaic energy into usable AC current. Wuxi Lead provides manufacturing systems for both EV batteries and the solar chain.Chinese governance can still affect China's EV and renewable-energy industries. Private solar-parts makers supply state power producers, which could call in bureaucrats to control prices.Most polysilicon, the raw material for solar panels, is made in Xinjiang, a province notorious for Beijing's persecution of the ethnic Uighur minority. The reason is cheap coal-fired power, also not a selling point.But the industry looks strongly aligned with state interests, as China watchers like to say, which should carry it to new heights. ""This is seen as a driver for huge economic growth and leverage to become a 21st-century tech leader,"" Woodmac's Whitworth says."

"NIO To Install Over 4,000 Battery Swap Stations By End Of 2025NIO Battery Swap Station - Power Swap Station 2.0Jul 11, 2021 By: Mark KaneThe infrastructure will be open for the industry.NIO announced during its first NIO Power Day in Shanghai a massive plan to expand battery swap station deployment - NIO Power 2025.The Chinese manufacturer already has a network of 301 NIO Power Swap stations, 204 Power Charger fast-charging stations and 382 destination charging stations in China. The swap stations cumulatively were used 2.9 million times (over 9,600 per station on average).By the end of this year, the number of stations is expected to increase to over 700, which is a substantial increase compared to the previous target of 500.4,000 stations by the end of 2025 and open standardThen, the company intends to add some 600 units a year (2022-2025), which will result in some 3,000 units in total. With an additional 1,000 or so outside China, the total number will be 4,000 by the end of 2025""To provide a better power service experience to its rapidly growing user base, NIO will further expand NIO Power’s charging and swapping network. This year, NIO has raised its target of having over 700 instead of 500 battery swap stations installed by year end. From 2022 to 2025, NIO commits to installing 600 new battery swap stations in China. By the end of 2025, NIO will have more than 4,000 NIO battery swap stations worldwide with around 1,000 outside of China.""One of the most interesting things is that the NIO's charging and swapping system will be fully available for other manufacturers if they are willing to join (of course, it would require making their cars compatible)."

"$tesla just launched Tesla Energy to sell back power to the grid. Elon thinks it will be as big as the car company some day. So don't you all think $nio with it's government ties will be able to do the same thing in China and potentially the US and globally with the battery swap station infrastructure in conjunction with current energy and oil companies and global patents?Analysts haven't even begun to bake this into valuations or the real value of autonomous driving and Robotaxis. Nio will be providing content, advertising, software, utilizing the car in ways only imagined now on top of dominating the clean energy business in the largest market in the world. Nio maybe over priced for number of cars produced in 2021, but it is severely underpriced for it's 2025 valuation and most likely production. Good buy now, hold for the long run. Do your own DD, trust your own analysis."
There is little point in companies boasting about major battery improvements if customers have to buy a whole new car to experience the benefit... Innovative battery improvements (at the speed they are taking place) are redundant if you cant get them into existing cars. That is where Battery Swap will benefit NIO exponentially.

To test the ET7's performance in winter, NIO transported the test vehicle to New Zealand in the southern hemisphere.Winter testing is a fundamental and essential part of the ET7 testing program, which includes dynamic testing on all types of low-traction surfaces, according to NIO. NIO completes winter testing of ET7-CnEVPostThis includes verification and testing of the power control system, chassis performance testing, and calibration and testing of selected driving modes, with the aim of providing a safe and comfortable driving experience for users in different usage scenarios, the company said.NIO's winter testing of the ET7 took place over a month in July at the SHPG International Test Track in New Zealand.The site is a well-known winter test track in the southern hemisphere, open only from June to August each year, where many car brands conduct their tests.It is located in the foothills, near the Cardrona Valley near Queenstown. The complex mountainous conditions make the test track environment more similar to daily car scenarios.The test track covers an area of approximately 4.9 million square meters, with 18 snow test tracks, 7 ice test tracks and 12 handling test tracks.NIO completes winter testing of ET7-CnEVPost NIO's testing of the ET7 covered many different types of surfaces, including snow, ice, separated surfaces, step surfaces, bumpy surfaces, ramps, and handling roads.NIO gave examples of three main test programs:Testing on a 60-meter radius snow/ice circle to verify the ESC (Electronic Stability Control) function and ensure that the vehicle does not understeer and oversteer for safe driving.NIO completes winter testing of ET7-CnEVPostA 125-meter-long combined asphalt and ice road test to verify ABS (Anti-lock Braking) and TCS (Traction Control) functions to ensure vehicle stability while ensuring braking distance and acceleration.NIO completes winter testing of ET7-CnEVPostOn the 1,273-meter-long handling road, the ESC/TCS/ABS functions are tested in combination to ensure vehicle stability and handling even when accelerating, braking, coasting and steering under extremely low ground adhesion.

It has a peak torque of 850 Nm and accelerates from 0-100 100 km in just 3.9 seconds.The pre-subsidy price of NIO ET7 is RMB 448,000 ($70,100) - 526,000. If users choose NIO's battery rental solution BaaS, the pre-subsidy price drops to RMB 378,000-398,000 with a monthly battery rental of RMB 980-1,480.In June, a meeting note posted on the NIO board of the Chinese electric vehicle forum ddxq.tech, purportedly from NIO motor component supplier Zhejiang Founder Motor, said that the NIO ET7 has a sales target of 50,000 units in 2022.""The NIO ET7 will enter the market in the first quarter of next year and we will start supplying it 2 months earlier. the ET7 is targeting 50,000 units next year and motor demand is expected to be 100,000 units,"" the minutes, dated June 4, show.China International Capital Corporation (CICC), China's largest investment bank, said in a research report released in early July that the ET7 is expected to contribute 70,000 units to NIO's sales next year, bringing the company's total sales to 170,000 units.If the forecast comes true, it means NIO will deliver an average of 5,830 ET7 units per month next year, which is expected to make the model NIO's mainstay."

"IGNORE AT YOUR OWN PERIL Mercedes, BMW & Audi currently sell a miniscule number of EVs relative to their huge sales network throughout China – Seems Chinese Consumer has very little interest in EV Products of these Global Giants.All of this at a time when NIO does not even have a Sedan to sell.What does this tell us:NIO already has Big, perhaps Unsurmountable, Moat in Premium Luxury Segment.NIO House, NIO Service, NIO Life, NIO Points, NIO Credits, NIO Life Time Warranty, NIO BaaS are sales combination for which, proven over past 50 years, German Global Sales Giants have no answer.ET7 being NIO's first Sedan will further highlight the shortcomings of German BBA Giants. Next Gen Vs Old School NO Comparison NO competition.NIO's two new models built on its Next Gen Platform will consolidate NIO supremacy -- Relax with new offerings NIO will also target Porsche where VW makes majority of its profit."

"ID NIO AFTER AN EU PATENT TOO?The company recently announced that both, the NIO Power Swap and charging equipment acquired CE & TÜV certifications and departed for Norway, which is the first European export market for NIO.

This year, its charging map for Europe and first four Power Swap Stations will be up and running. In 2022, NIO will build battery swap stations in five cities of Norway."
"Customer deliveries will start in September.NIO announced that the first batch of NIO ES8 cars were shipped from Shanghai to Norway on July 20, which opens a new chapter in the company's history.1 more day until Norway expansion, then the world!"
"No reason this stock should be under $50.00 pure manipulations between the two government, they did the same thing to Alibaba the competitor of Amazon and now there going after NIO which in Tesla competitor."
38.90 I guess is the wall for today
Both Toyota and VW are massively cutting production as much 40% - the chip shortage has his this massive high production companies very hard! - the fact the the Chinese EV car makers are actually increasing production numbers is a strong indication of market changes to happening in the auto industry as whole! It certainly much much easier for NIO to Secure enough chips for 9000-12000 cars chips a month than Toyota and VW which have over 1 million production a month. - it would be a very interesting up CHU long 12 months indeed ￼￼
"Sinopec said the two companies(Nio) will cooperate in charging & battery swap station construction, brand marketing, materials, and battery asset operation."

"Once everyone else digest and understand the magnitude of the NIO, LOTUS relationship as well as the true value of a end to end Corporate juggernaut that lays before our feet, the monies will start rolling in even faster.With the latest Lotus news coupled with Ford, I feel it’s inevitable more will start pouring in. (FOMO will be in full affect)The relationship between the two is the proverbial shot a cross the EV bow of success and more to come I’m sure :) this puts everyone else on notice.I don’t know of any other EV company that has demonstrated themselves to be worthy of the accomplishments and strides and efficiency not to mention the time frame in which NIO has executed on so many levels, that most could only even dreamed of doing :)Good Luck fellow LONGS!"

But this is your chance to buy at the low."
After NIO beat estimates last month and described the future the hedge funds made accumulation of NIO shares Priority One. High speed trading and selling upticks can bring any stock down But eventually you have to buy and hold real shares. Shorts get called back and phantom shares are like thin air.

On the bright side…some volume is returned. Almost Friday’s total day volume is just 2 hours after open. Another 20 mil or so today and we might see green.
NIO longs should understand the US financial press is controlled by payola. EV stocks are all being driven down by hedge funds who missed the run up in 2020 and are accumulating shares for the real boom in 2022. Sorry if you have to sell but this time next year I expect NIO to trade over $160
"My deep detailed analysis on NIO reveals the following:NIO is expected to roll out the E7 shortly with a profit margin of approximately 11.45%, which is slightly below the currently fleet of 12.14%. The EDBITA, adjusted for inflation, is about 6% of the gross longitudinal vortex curve which will cause the stock to trade sideways for the time being. The quarterly growth is expected to be 75% to 85% compared to revenues of approximately 6,000,000 yuan or the conversion ratio 7.35 to 1.8 to US dollar. The spatial fortitude will continue to propel this stock despite the chip shortage that has affected the auto industry, causing a spike in stock price in mid October of this year. The accelerated growth will exceed the expectations provided by the company in July, resulting in a shareholder price in the $55 range. I expect this trend to continue through the first half of 2022 and have a 12 month target price of $68, barring any continued thorpes of incognitudes"
NIO will be profitable in November when they report financials again! The first time ever since ipo launch! Sedan begins production in just a few months! Stock will double in 90 days!

"The problem we have is that this is a Chinese stock. Baidu, alibaba are worth so much more than the present stock price but investors are wary of investing. Until demand for shares increase due to the Chinese worries subsiding then we will continue to see Nio trading at a discount to what it should be. Imaging LUCID producing Nio figures.... the share price would be $90 plus..."

"Little info on NI BATTERY SWAP - Tesla tried and so have others. The NIO difference is NIO's works and has been used over 2 million times. The second is this.

Lets cut back to China where the largest gas station chain Sinopec has already committed to 5000 NIO swap modules by 2025. Battery Swap may be the salvation of ""energy companies"" as the green movement overtakes oil. So what do you think US oil companies will do with it and NIO holding the patents? and I mean patents with over 4000 to date.."
With the Current market of NIO right now we traders are supposed to earn as compensation for our so many loses and bad trades we’ve made and this can only happen by having the right guide. Mr Darren on Te**le**gr**am; @darrenwalkenfx is a very perfect guide for times like this.
EXPEV is creeping some distance from NIO. Does anyone think that being on the Hong Kong exchange is making the difference in EXPEV vs NIO
What is it with bashers last few days saying they are selling there NIO now?? They been bashing the stock for months! Do they not see we can look at there history haha desperate people
"I believe the main catalysts of NIO are as follows: 1). Fundamentals are strong and solid. 2).Anhui Province gov't co-build the million car production facilities. 3). China Oil $ Chemical Co. have over 30,000 gas stations converting into BaaS 4). Cash and credit lines are ample for NIO's usage. 5). NIO is the highest proud to Chinese. They also have the highest quality cars in the world. 6). NIO is for sure growing fast very month, ever quarter and every year. ............................................................. You can mention more. ....................................."
NIO is being re-accumulated in a massive way. Hope you're buying or adding because we seen this act before and longs won it all three times. Resistance is at $39.40 and there are gaps to $46 and $52 to fill
"NIO has started allowing Norwegian users to test drive its ES8 SUV, marking its latest step in entering the international market."
Who bought $NIO or $TSLA in the single digits???? That's right.
Made over a million dollars last year on NIO…great stock with an awesome future! Enjoy 
"Car deliveries 2019 Q3 4,799. Car deliveries 2021 Q2 21,896. Total revenue US$ 1.308.4 BILLION Q2 2021Gross profit 243.8 million Q2Hopefully it will stay down so I can keep buying more! As longs as those car keep leaving the factory and hitting the road I’ll be invested."
You may never find another stock that has an $80 business hidden inside at $52 stocks NIO can set you up for life
"NIO is a speculation stock anymore. This is a serious contender to be a FANG level company. Anyone who knows about NIO and is not in it for a realistic time frame is hurting themself. We need to all move it up and let it turn into real money, not hold it down for a few leaches looking for entry. They had a month."
Bravo on a strong finish to the day NIO!
"NIO delivered 7,931 vehicles in July 2021, representing a strong 124.5% year-over-year growth. The deliveries consisted of 1,702 ES8s, the Company’s six-seater or seven-seater flagship premium smart electric SUV, 3,669 ES6s, the Company’s five-seater high-performance premium smart electric SUV, and 2,560 EC6s, the Company’s five-seater premium smart electric coupe SUV. As of July 31, 2021, cumulative deliveries of the ES8, ES6 and EC6 reached 125,528 vehicles."
NIO will return to its highs right after the heist is over Everybody wants NIO stock and the big boys know how to glom it
"NIO SAYS GOODBYE LITHIUM BATTERIES NIO announced the launch of a new 150 kWh solid-state battery pack, coming at the end of 2022, which would make all-new NIO ET7 deliver the 1,000km (NEDC) of range. This announcement follows the technology roadmap of Li-ion battery development. NIO states that the energy density of its semi solid-state battery would reach 360 Wh/kg, a more than 60% increase in comparison with the commercialised Li-ion battery in 2020, coupled with improved safety performance."
"So, I've been on the sidelines with Nio - have preferred XPEV, mainly because I've done more research on that company.Question: What do you consider to be Nio's long term catalysts?"
"No worries, Nio made in China or Tesla made in China, there is only one who wins big, guess who !!!"
"According to Wall Street, sales for Nio are expected to catapult from $2.55 billion in 2020 to $16.83 billion by 2024. It is a 560% implied sales growth by 2024, just in about 3-years time."
"NIO's sales are expected to grow rapidlyNIO is expected to have sales of $8.9B next year, twice as much as XPeng… which has the same P-S ratio than NIO. Li Auto has the cheapest sales growth as FY 2022 revenues are valued with a 5.2 sales multiplier factor. Looking at estimated 5-year revenue growth, Li Auto is expected to grow sales the fastest, in part because of its smaller size. However, NIO will still have very impressive revenue growth of 310% until 2025 (based on next year's sales). Because of NIO's BaaS revenue opportunity (which is better than XPeng's battery lease model), I would choose NIO over the other two Chinese EV makers... despite the lower total sales growth rate."
"EV Market in China moving Down to Mid Level EV's, High End Suffering now, even Tesla knew this would happened and of course came out with Lower Priced EV's. NIO has nothing for at least 6 months."

Above the dynamic balancing machine is an external power supply switch panel, which can supply power to other equipment.The interior of the car is equipped with interior and parts tool cabinets. The bottom half of the door on the left side is a tool cabinet for fine tools, and above it and the door on the right side are large pieces of equipment or accessories.Tools in the tool cabinets are all insulated to protect the safety of the electric vehicle service rescue team. The tool cabinet is also the most expensive part of the mobile service truck, according to NIO.The trolley equipped with the service truck can be loaded with the required tools into a small space to make up for the difficulty of accessing each site obstacles.The engineering computer inside the vehicle is used to overhaul software problems including NOMI and clear fault codes.In addition to a jack to lift the body, a safety bench is provided as double insurance. The safety stool can support up to 6 tons of body to ensure the safety of personnel, according to NIO."
