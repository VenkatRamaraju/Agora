"NIO US Battery Swap Patent - Could be worth $80+ a shareNIO is making big moves in this area, which leads us to believe that, one day, the company could hold a significant market share of the Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) market. Ripe for the Picking The EVCS market is ripe for the picking, and NIO doesn't want to miss out. According to a report by Astute Analytica, the EVCS market could reach $93 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 20%. NIO is developing the charging infrastructure that will power the EVs of tomorrow. While it is still unclear how these charging stations will work, BaaS vs regular charging, for example, or how profitable this business will be, we do know that EV charging will be a billion-dollar industry."
"Short term, who knows. Long term, still confident. NIO is disruptive ;)"

Per the report, PBoC — being a member of the Joint Conference to Deal with Illegal Fund Raising — actively cooperates with the lead department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

"MF's are getting it. ""Nio: 560% implied sales growth by 2024It's no secret that electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are set up perfectly to benefit from a multi-decade replacement cycle for consumer and enterprise vehicles. Nio's (NYSE:NIO) opportunity within EVs is perhaps even more impressive given that it's based in China, the world's largest auto market.According to Wall Street, sales for Nio are expected to catapult from $2.55 billion in 2020 to $16.83 billion by 2024. For those of you keeping score at home, that's a 560% projected sales increase."""
Bottom is In. EV Stocks oversold and poised to run again

"Don't you all see, this is getting primed for nxt big move up to 60 - 70$...professionals want your shares cheap, stop selling, just hold, simple really!"
We thought NIO had a 72% annual growth rate. Apparently according to new analysts forecasts it just went up to 169% a year or 508% going into 2024
"No worries, Nio made in China or Tesla made in China, there is only one who wins big, guess who !!!"
Best stock in the financial market for a long term investment
"See you @ $300According to a report by Astute Analytica, the EVCS market could reach $93 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 20%. NIO is developing the charging infrastructure that will power the EVs of tomorrow. While it is still unclear how these charging stations will work, BaaS vs regular charging, for example, or how profitable this business will be, we do know that EV charging will be a billion-dollar industry."
"last year I swing traded this for, 60,80 and 45% profits. the breakouts were the norm. now it's been idling for almost the whole year. ima grab some cheap shares and hold long term. next year will be great!!!"
"I've talked about the Chinese EV market growing at a rate of 40%/year based upon 1.18 million EV's sold in China in 2020, and projections for China to be buying over 5 million by 2025. It would be great if NIO were to grow at that 40% rate as well! However, NIO is on pace to sell 85,000-90,000 vehicles which is about a 100% gain from last year's 43,728 vehicles sold. The JAC/NIO factory is contracted to be completed by January 25th, 2022. It will be making the ET7, which will sell a minimum of 50,000 of them (I've heard that there are actually up to 70,000 pre-orders). Even if NIO doesn't sell any more ES8/ES6/EC6's that they will sell by the end of this year, they will be increasing their total number of deliveries by OVER 50% next year. Increasing those numbers (sales of the ES8, ES6, and EC6) by 40% is a reasonable expectation IMO, so we could be close to another 100% increase in deliveries next year.Other catalysts are:-The 2 new cars that will be introduced on NIO Day, the ET5, and the new smaller car with the new brand, ""Alpes"", targeting the $25,000-$30,000 market.-The new 1 million car factory NeoPark should be completed during the summer of 2022.-The chip shortage should be a thing of the past, but just know that Li Bin has stated that NIO will be working on making their own chips, and we could hear about that at any time.If we are increasing deliveries by 100%, isn't it reasonable to see the SP increase accordingly?"
"NIO: The Sky Is The LimitAug. 27, 2021 Summary NIO is on its way to becoming a dominant force in the charging station market. This adds value to its business and also allows NIO to monetize this infrastructure. At the current rate, NIO could have a significant share of the $98 billion market that charging stations will soon become."
