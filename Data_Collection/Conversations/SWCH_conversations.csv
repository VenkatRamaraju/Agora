"Great news!! The predicted forecast and the consensus EPS forecast for this quarter (Nov 13th ER) ive read is between $0.06-$0.07. Analysts are saying to expect this number to go up over the next upcoming years (Switch’s Q4 2017 earnings at ($0.21) EPS, FY2018 earnings at $0.21 EPS and FY2019 earnings at $0.28 EPS...., and why shouldn't it considering this company is just growing and leading the pack,adding more data centers. Go long or go home!!! Don't sleep on this stock and wait til morning of Tuesday November 14 b/c u'll have missed the boat by then."
"Currently lot of companies are targeting Zero emission by 2030, 2040, 2050. This boy did it before 2020.Give some respect to this stock price ;)"
Patience with this one. They are investing huge in the data centers. Hundreds of millions to build one. They have over a 97% customer retaining rate with some big names. Revenue is sky rocketing year over year for 4 years. At some point they will get past initial investments this will become a cash cow and probably be a 10x winner. Accumulate and be patient!!!

If the share down after this fantastic quarter it Will Be Good Entry lets Wait For The Ceo Comment Otherwise Fantastic Quarter
This company has been in business since 2000 they have 17 years under their belt. Data center industry is growing. Ipo raised 531 million dollars. Guidance will be good
I should have switched stocks
I'm on the side lines waiting for my personal buy signals. Once it truly bottoms will be plunty of time to profit even if I miss some short term gains. Long term $$$$
it's started
Ever since I picked up a small amount of shares as my spec play I have been hedging myself with a put spread. I am making more money on that than I am with capital appreciation so my overall position is in the green. When we have that turnaround I will trade off my put spread for some long term calls. No matter what happens in this stock I make good money. I'd love to hear some thoughts on earnings news because that could change this company and my position completely
"Today on 5/3/18, everything is red in my portfolio except..... SWCH I don't know what's going on anymore."
Bitcoin investors coming to SWCH.
hope for nice earnings report after today's close
i can easily see SWCH go to 20$/share in the near future
"…but isn’t the conversion to a REIT a lengthy process? Besides the initial ‘excitement’ of the news, when can we begin to see a profit of the reorganization reflected in the price?Interested to buy long, but I’m waiting for the hype to settle."
I added another additional 59k shares worth to my stake @ $12.90I am going long. Don't care what the bears said. I am in faith.
Switches buy rating reiterated by BMO capital markets to $20 target
"That's why it is important to jump in now b/c it is going to hit 20 (as it did after last ER b/c there is NO way it can not meet next ER with such ridculous EPS expecation low forecast of -.22). This is a very stable and great company, got great growth and immense potential."
Sympathy push to the upside from sector movement...this thing will be fine
Glad I've been holding SWCH 
"Still holding all my shares; hopefully, buy-out offer soon. All the indicators are there....With 50% premium, it will likely be $19's.. GL longs."
Wish i could double my position here
Be happy ! Hold on to what you have and cherish. Just don't expect too much from anything then you'll be at ease .
"Still looking flat folks. The market has been on fire, breaking new highs everywhere so not sure why anyone would be letting good money sit here on SWCH. I understand there is nothing particulaurly wrong with Switch other than it's stock performance, which is what we all really care about. Even on days like today where there is a nice little pop in the morning, it fails on very lite volume. Only takes a few sellers to squash it back down. Eventually it will break past the resistance and I hope to be there to jump on, but technically it still has a few hurdles to jump."
I believe this is a buying opportunity. Atlanta will be huge for the bottom line. a lot of investment has gone into it. Time for the ROI
I didn’t buy enough on Friday. I’ll pick up more if it comes back down.

why this stock is not a popular one? holding tight forever
Oh...Trading with a high volume today .and a good sign
SWCH is much bigger next year. Revenues growth . 21% yoyMissed ER doesn't mean it's not growing. Building #11 is still under construction at the core campus Vegas. Big one in Atlanta is underway.Data centers are demanding resources .
One year chart looking good! I like the upward trend...

when the solar project comes online the share price will go up fast. powering one million homes is mind boggling

"I had 5000 pcs in , hope this one will do ok later on. Due to the expansion of its business infrastructure , that's why I bought it. Come on lucky dollars !"
"Wow....the conference call was MIND-BLOWING!!! It seemed as if they sort of highlighted the benefit of this stock in terms of both a short term AND long term gainer, highlighting the fact that next year they will complete building of second las vegas campus to make it largest data center in world not to mention an atlanta campus to where they are going to gain and acquire East coast customers. They also stressed how they are dealing mostly with high tier (tier 5) instead of other companies that only deal with tear one or two, and can't have as much storage and hence can't compete. They're on the grow, and it seems like as they beat all estimates this quarter (and will continue to during next couple of quarters)....."
Insider buys this weekhttp://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/4/summary/?id=4629904
Keep in mind that nearly ALL Casinos in Las Vegas use SWITCH...that's a LOT of chips...
"According to the data, it shows it had an increased revenues overtime , like 9.5% So technically , it's still a profitable data center colocation service provider .Wait like 1-2 years to finalized our investment decisions."
"Keep holding guys, you won’t regret it by mid of 2018. Look at the 1. Number patents registered for the company 2. Expansion of new data centre. 3. Last 4 quarters earnings are all profitable4. Next earnings forecast is already low and it will beat for sure to make 2 consecutive beats after IPO5. Growing demands of data centre business6. Compare to competitor price is still cheapGLTA"
Hopefully this is the beginning of our santa Claus rally.

No news and less noise though and we all will be fine..(longs).

For such a down day in the market this stock is holding up really well today. It points to a good buying opportunity

I got scared then cancel my orders. I was new to investing at the time.Now AMD is up 500% from where I was going to buy in. be the judge of yourself , maybe you're smarter this way.If you really see a bargain , grab it , have faith in the companies you're investing in. Keep your watch on the news but don't rely too much on it.I believe in luck. Luck sometimes outperform the smartest analysts on Wall Street . Luck outperforms anything in its path ."

"BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long reiterated his Outperform rating on the shares of Switch and a $23 price target.Switch reported solid third quarter results, with modest upside to BMO Capital Market's revenue and adjusted EBITDA estimates, Long said in a Monday noteAbout 68 percent of the growth came organically, while the remaining 32 percent from new customers, the analyst said. Despite gross and operating margins trailing estimates, adjusted EBITDA of $50 million was slightly above BMO's $49 million estimate.""Gross margins in the quarter benefitted from Switch becoming an unbundled energy provider in Nevada, which added 300bps to gross margin,"" Long said. Highlighting the differentiation and stickiness of offerings, Switch added 29 new customers and reportedchurn of only 0.3 percent, according to BMO.Fiscal 2017 revenue and EBITDA guidance were in line with Long's estimates, but capex guidance exceeded his expectation, he said.

how did the conference call go?
SWCH is up 5.01% to 15.73
"This is the first small cap I bought since started investing. (newby) Wow bought at 8.10 in March and 100% gain. I bought 200 shares. This was my spec play in my portfolio and I don't know if I chose wisely or just got lucky, but WoW!! This is a long term play guess I bought at just right time"
"SWCH was brought to my attention, so I started watching and read past earning reports. They an interesting and workable business plan if properly executed. They have expansion ideas but their expansion has been delayed and because of that they keep taking on mote debt. In the conference call management kept pointing their fingers to the pandemic as a reason for their expansion being delayed. Many other companies have been able to execute and do well through this pandemic and enhance shareholder value.SWCH management needs to figure out how to accelerate expansion so that they can get beyong single digit growtoeth and bring in revenue above anylsis expectations."
"As I predic it,rising fast,should hit 16 by end of the week,,Cho choooooooooooooooooooo"
"Good earnings, and the conference call sounded very positive. Now let’s see how the market feels about that."
"ok why is this forum so dead, seriously? 2.5million for volume yet 1 comment per week? Seems very off. plus, this stock is really undervalued by all metrics"
Next earning re-scheduled to 2nd April 2018 after market close.So finally they realize the having a earning just a day before holiday would hit the stock. As they will surely beat the low number set.GLTA
"whelp, guess I'll average down again. :)Long and strong baby"
"eps estimate 4 cents, hits 8 cents.Go through their presentation, they are planing on more growth per square feet, and partners are growing every q.The P/E is expensive, but long term company can be triple digits with slow buy backs & growth of companies needing more protection from hacks.If you believe in online data as the future, Switch is the castle thats holds the princess."

"I’m starting to get back into this stock. With the new buildings being added, earnings will increase over time. Expecting $20+/share in less than 2 years."
Not worried. This will definitely beat expectations come next quarter. Don't expect any magic next few weeks. It'll pick up closer to earnings in February when it should go back up to the 20s. So much potential and upside in this puppy.
this week will be 40$/s

"Switch has got top notch clients in the business world including ebay, amazon, verizon, wells fargo, cisco to name a few.Switch has a very large patent portfolio (hundreds of patents), probably biggest amongst its peers.Switch has the HIGHEST growth rate amongts its peers, accelerating its revenue grown by 25% by fiscal 2019.Switch has the potential to gain 3 billion dollars in revenue just by filling its data centers (which it will do given the momentum switch is attaining/going to attain given its the premier industry leader amongst its peers).Switch has nowhere but to climb up and up and up......such an undervalued stock!!! Has SO MUCH going for it!"
Nice and steady up trend in the last week. Let’s see if we can hit 19 by the end of the week.
Cisco earnings up and expecting growth in cloud software/datacenter
Wth??? I’ve seen their facility 1st hand. It’s amazing! Too bad the stock say different about the performance.

Why the steady decline?
"Earnings Date on 05/09/21, stock will go up! I love that stock in terms of so many overvalued stocks"
SWCH must be spending a lot on cash because prediction of .05 eps at 113 million and we got .03 eps at 117 million. SWCH should’ve crushed earnings. In time this company will be a 50$ stock with 3$ dividend.
"quick question, why do companies use Switch? why don't they just build their own data centre? is ut a difficult endeavour? i mean, i know the basics of the theory but don't know what it takes to build one out."

Amazon Prime video streaming might use SWCH too in the near future.
"Impressive how switch is rising from the ashes and how it went up to 16.75 today. I see it climbing again tomorrow, gonna see 17 very soon!! People know this is a solid company with great outlook."
"Price action of a stock depends on investors, traders abroad.More demand, more people cashing in for the stock, a breakout likely to happen. It 's all about demand.Company performance , earnings , these are separate considerations.I see some companies has negative earnings, high PE, P/B ratios and their stock going up like crazy, super hype !Why? People and demand for the stock. SWCH just need to be lovedby investors so that the share price can start climbing. Simple !"
"Breakout happening now, Q4$ will blow away the highest estimates,"
do the bubble up!
Miss EPS but beat revenue. Guidance remains the same. My guess tomorrow will be +/- 5%.
Showing great slow gains over the last couple weeks. Will have to wait and see what next weeks earnings does to this up trend.Hope it continues moving upward.

"20% growth rate is not impressive. There are100s of companies with 50% growth rate and better, so not sure why anyone would park their money here. Also consider that SWCH has performed poorly in a record breaking market. When this market pulls back (which is very likely at least for the tech sector) SWCH will go with it. I watch SWCH for a short term pops but no way I'd hold thru months and months at this point. Stocks make amazing gains AFTER accumulation and I just don't see any. YES YES i know..SWCH is a good company and has beautiful facilities, so of course, it's going to be around for years to come, but the ""break out"" has some serious hurdles still to jump. It's appears the big boys are in NO Hurry for SWCH. Peace!"
"If you look at my previous post about 11 days ago, i said this'll probably stay in the 17s for now. Now, as it gets closer to Feb 12th (which is around the corner), you're going to see it start climbing. I'm hoping that before it does, but it may be that it might hang around 17s and then really surge day of or one-two days before earnings report. But one things for sure....expect in the 20s after ER comes out (as it hit the 20s after first ER). This time around it'll beat two ER, more expansion and future potential revealed and this company continues to expand and grow."

BMO noted its coverage group within the sector is trading at a 19% discount to the S&P 500 and in two of the last three times when the group was at a similar discount, the sector rebounded ""meaningfully."" In turn, the firm said, ""we would not be surprised by more outperformance this year.""For 2018, BMO kept Motorola Solutions (MSI) on its list of top picks and added two others to the list: NetApp (NTAP) and Switch (SWCH). The firm said it sees MSI as ""set up well now that all states have opted into FirstNet, and we expect the focus will shift to ramping solutions in support of the nationwide LTE network.""As for the new additions, BMO said it expects NetApp ""will continue to benefit from the ramp in [all-flash arrays], as well as better execution in services, helping revenue to stay in the mid-single digit range."" The firm believes Switch is ""best positioned to benefit from strength in colocation, and its best-in-breed technology will likely lead to further share gains.""As part of the sector outlook for 2018, BMO also upgraded its investment rating on F5 Networks (FFIV) to outperform from market perform while downgraded its investment rating on Western Digital (WDC) to market perform from outperform."
"Well...hasn't been much good to say about SWCH stock this last year but at least it's not caving in with the market. 94k shares so far today is a blessing. Pretty much just being ignored, which again, on a day like today is wonderful. GL longs."
Look at the big picture Data will increase and Data Centers will get bigger which means big profits.

"Swch mirrors Roku...both were in the red and went down today. I predict that tomorrow it'll go up. Patience is the key to this stock. It's not as sexy as other stocks, but it truly is a solid company. Wait til next Earnings Report to start thinking about any exit plans. Don't take the loss b/c victory will be ours early next year and the oncoming months ahead!"
I had 5000 shares bought at 24.63 on the very first day. Lesson learned never buy any stock on the frist day. Had sold all last week @10.20 . Took 70k loss. I had kept it thought after earning it might go up again but with every ER it went down more. Good luck everyone who have been holding it.
Holy smokas this ain’t no jokas 
"question: rough napkin math based on Yahoo data, why does this trade at such a high multiple of earnings? I'm guessing a high forecasted return on the pp&e spending? The bottom line is only growing at 10%... what's the bull case?"
Thank god I sold at 13.5 with a loss
Can anyone tell me why Zacks Investment Research forcast for the 2/12/18 earnings report is $-0.22??????
It is nice to see news on this stock other than the class action lawsuits. Reading the earnings miss and the analyst downgrades is a refreshing change.

"SWCH is behind CONE, QTS and COR,but it's catching on .Get onboard while it's still fairly cheappeople."
"If SWCH hit $13 , I will buy more sharesBut I doubt that it will be that low."
Wells Fargo report 11.58% stake in Switch. Big boys moving in!
SWCH just broke resistance today and possibly heading to $15.
Help me here... Why would you open data centers in hot climates???Wouldn't the best idea be to locate them in cold climates where cooling the equipment would be less expensive?Just curious.
Need more buyers here !!!!! I wanna see $20 soon .
I just drove by it earlier took some pictures. If you provide me your email address I can forward you some pictures. Major constructions underway truly amazing.

nice to see it up on a down day...still need cloud storage no matter what weather brings the market
"We are excited to report that Switch ended the year with a record recurring revenue backlog of more than $50 million, our highest ever as a public company."
"Why this is up today, Am I missing anything? they have changed the earning date so traditionally it should go down. Any insights on this would be helpful. FYI: I am long on this since day 1 of IPO."

SWCH did a pretty good job managing their debt.
Can we hold these 5% gains on Friday?
