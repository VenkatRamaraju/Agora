"AXON took a small hit after T-Mobile announced they will migrate 1st responder smart phones to body cameras. T- Mobile shares took a small hit the same day. This is a nothing burger. Integrity, storage, evidence reliability in not a commodity. Looking to add on a bigger over reaction. GO AXON !!!"
And the Axon phychosis continues!

"Oh wait, my bad, some of you are actually hoping for a dividend. Me, stock appreciation, thats it. Get me to how you appreciate the stock, its all good. Since we have no news how that is happening - I offer the only 2 possibilities available.Split Stock or Split company."
"Pima County Arizona approved $26,000,000 for body cameras and Tasers"

THIS STOCK GETS MANIPULATED SO MUCH !!
Is there something I should know?

Just another buying opportunity. Picked up some more in the mid 164's.
$AXON is a bargain right now. Pick some up before you miss the ride back to $200+!!!
"T-Mobile wants to use its phones as body cameras for first responders? Who else has heard this, and do they propose evidence storage and retrieval?"
I see Axon is off of it's meds again!
"IMMA say , SAS side is worth 15 Billion on its own ---- maybe 20 Billion should one of the whales want the cloud traffic.Its time - SAS is where the money is - hardware meh - it can still be leveraged.( wonder if he's got in into his head to build his own cloud - that would be interesting - but problematic )"
Wow...down 5 days in a row while the market has been breaking records.
"In its most recent quarter, Axon Enterprise earnings and sales growth rate both rose. Earnings soared a ridiculous 3,900% vs. the same quarter a year earlier"

"Its like being preganant, and I ain't pregnant - SPLITTTTT BIOTCH.Seriously though, do you think we are heading for some sort of split phenomena in the market ? I get this feeling there are art least 40 stocks ripe for splitting."
"Taser split - how has it done ?Nvidia split - how has it done ?MSFT split - how has it done ?Apple split - how has it done ?Taser down from 212 to - where are we today, hmmm sub 180. Nice metric for a monopoly . An Axon 4 fer 1 split will get you 100 with a float of 240 million shares......incredible metric. And yes, everything stays the same, except, more investors will now be trading it. And yes, alot with no understanding in investing, except, they see a a ""cheap "" stock . Bobbbo - understand why stock splits happen. Then apply the understanding. It's all psychological.If Ricky splits the stock, I garrrrrrAnteee, you'll get a #$%$"
you are concerned about a director selling 8% of his holdings? LOL seriously?
come on Rick....split the thing...4 fer 1
AXON offers a platform/portfolio of very sticky products and services. In many ways it reminds me of Microsoft Office in its earlier days.
"Where is OperaNStox....I miss her....who was that big short, forget his name, he was good."
"Of the 25 stocks I own/follow, only Axon is in the green today. Its proving to be a very resilient stock."
Buy this and forget about it. 10 years from now you will be very happy. I look back to when I accumulated at between $5 and $7 many years ago. There hasn't been and doesn't appear to be any competition out there. Gold standard !!
