"In 2020, operating expenses were 63 percent of total revenue; for the LTM, 80 percent. Operating expense growth continues to exceed revenue growth. When will AXON be profitable? The CEO has a nice pay contract."
"Guys, can we all agree to stop talking about stock splits? It makes not difference, since you can now buy fractional shares. Focus on the business plan and fundamentals. Please, everyone, shut up about stock splits. Nobody cares and it won't drive up the stock price. So hear me loud and clear, SHUT UP ABOUT STOCK SPLITS ALREADY!!!"
Finally a green tinge for my 1 best stock.A rise after earnings? This is almost unheard of during these times.
should be up on the news

Good Friday!
congrats fellow long term longs...onward and upward...
Axon is selling those 3mm shares like there is no tomorrow!
The Phoenix Police Department is ready to spend nearly $6 million to equip all patrol officers with body-worn cameras that automatically activate.Chief Jeri Williams recently told the city’s public safety subcommittee she wants to move forward on a five-year contract worth $5.7 million with Scottsdale-based Axon Enterprises.http://kjzz.org/content/747577/phoenix-police-preparing-2000-body-cameras
"IMO, JPM is trying to lower the price so they can establish a position. They lowered their rating from overweight to neutral and lowered their price target.IMO, they want to get in before earnings and the race to 250."
Any info out here on why AXON's SG&A expense is SO HIGH? Despite big revenue growth the company is still not showing a profit. I don't get it.
"TASER SALES ARE STRONG!!(Toledo Police pushing to upgrade taser system.)The department plans to sign a new five-year agreement with Axon Enterprises to essentially “lease” new Tasers. Axon will cover the cost of the Taser and related equipment (like batteries, data storage, cartridges and more) as well as maintenance and training for officers.Axon will also buy back Toledo Police’s current tasers for upwards of $90,000.The new Tasers come with upgrades; they will be more effective at close range as well as have “automatic smart features.” Because much of the manual input with the tasers will be alleviated, TPD trainers say they will save the department an estimated five man hours per unit per year.Police trainers say they haven’t had any issues with their current tasers, but they want to be proactive.The contract for these tasers will cost city taxpayers $349,920 each year from the general fund after the first year of the contract (four years total).http://www.wtol.com/2019/02/16/toledo-police-pushing-upgrade-taser-system/"
AXE CAPITAL just upgraded AXON to STRONG BUY!!estimates $100 price target by earnings announcement!!
"Is This True? The government stimulus deal that was just passed, included 35 Million From The Government To Match Purchase Orders From States & Municipalities.... to help them obtain MORE body cameras.? That would be kinda a ""Big Deal"" for aaxn, because ya gotta store all that data and all that is additional recurring revenue (and great margins in that segment too.!)"
"Time to leverage Cloud side. Split company into 2 , Hardware, Software. The stock takes off"
Atlanta airport police to get body cameras [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]BY Knight Ridder/Tribune— 8:36 PM ET 05/10/2018May 10--Atlanta Police Department officers at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport will soon be outfitted with body cameras.It will be the first time officers at the world's busiest airport have been outfitted with body cameras. Millions of travelers from around the country and the world pass through the Atlanta airport.
"Worst manipulation of Axon stock price I’ve seen, and I have been following it a long time. “Quiet period” and fund managers typically reluctant to buy/add before earnings, leaves field open to constant sale pressure we have seen last couple days. SEC never anywhere to be found. Doubtful that even a small “whisper” miss could further depress this leader in rapidly expanding market. Good luck tomorrow, Longs!"
Let the dust settle and buy when you are confident. This company is right place right time. They have amazing products that this country and the rest of the world needs right now. They have just begun to scratch the surface of the total addressable market. It is huge and so is their moat No company in this area of the market is even close. No real competitors. I have been in this stock for a quite a few years now and have accumulated a pretty large position. Too big according to investing rules. The never put a lot of your eggs in one basket theory.The negative news right now is the FTC and their anti-competitive lawsuit against axon. The suit has been around for a while and the FTC wants axon to undo the merger with Vievue. This suit will drag on for quite a while but I believe axon will prevail. Just a minor distraction in the meantime. Axon saved Vievue and the FTC is clueless.
"With many growing companies investors bet on growth and the eventual hope that growth will result in profits. Axxon has growth, inevitable growth, security of government entities paying regularly, and predictably. It has both growth and profitability. Add to this, you get a constantly improving and necessary product. You couldn't ask for much more."
301 is the P/E. This is going up too fast. The market goes up every day to boot. Something doesn't seem right. This is too good to be true.
"I thought everything was coming up roses, yet we wallow around the mid $180s. I expected we'd be approaching $200+ by now."
"AAXN will relelase earnings on Feb 26. I will be interesting to see if results drive the stock up or down. From their web site:Axon to Release Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings on February 26, 2019"

"The Washington Times: FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals ‘unprepared’ for body camerasA new audit by the Justice Department Inspector General finds four federal law enforcement agencies are “generally unprepared” to implement body-worn camera programs.Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’s report released on Thursday says the federal agencies did not receive any of the $115 million dollars in DOJ grants for camera programs provided to other departments in the last decade. The federal agencies include the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.“For the past decade, the DOJ has studied, supported and promoted the use of body-worn cameras by state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies,” Mr. Horowitz said in a video included with the audit. “Nevertheless, our review found that DOJ law enforcement officers themselves largely did not use body-worn cameras.”"
"I think we are so early in the evolution of AXON and it's stock price. Once AXON records get a foot hold, AXON will own the market with a comprehensive end to end solution of products that no other competitor has. In an atmosphere of 'defund the police', the need for less office involved shooting, the need for accountability, with AXON records and AXON's full compliment of products, they can achieve it all because AXON records will save PDs money due to efficiencies producing records, [just like body cams and tasers due from a lawsuit perspective] and, if needed, with reduced officer count. (There is a butt load of time, overtime cost and effort doing paperwork)The best part is that AXON was onto records management a couple of years ago and invested in it properly. I image they have even more in the pipeline because they really understand the full operations of law enforcement and there is a lot more that can be done."
And I sold this last week at 27.75 . Another bad move
"I’m not quite sure why I keep hearing people say “it was a GREAT quarter, why the drop?” The quarter was not great. It was solid, perhaps good, but definitely not great. Quarterly revenue increased 20% yoy, good not great. Quarterly earnings came in below estimates, were down sequentially two Qs in a row, and down 38% yoy. For a stock price of $60 and yearly earnings of $0.52 per share, I would say the price was due to come down. I am a holder since 2017 and am still long the stock, but this report did not justify a $60 stock."
"Nice move today in a down market. Been waiting for the Military to get involved and finally on June 10th they announced the military police will equip with 2500 cameras. Many more will follow. Ready to launch. So glad I started buying ""Taser"" in 2014 before Fergusson incident. Go AXON !!!!!"
"If the Justice in Policing Act or something similar passes, that requires all police to wear cameras, how much more business is out there to be had? There is obviously a set number of police in the US so it is feasible, at least domestically, that the market will reach some sort of critical mass. Does anyone know what percentage of the current domestic police force is NOT yet using body cameras?"
"Just my 2 cents. I have equal and large positions in both AAXN and DGLY. I have made a good amount of money in Taser as a buyer since about $24. My hope and theory is that at the end of the day AAXN will be the sole winner, but they will need to get this lawsuit behind them. I don't think they have a good shot at winning it, as try as they might, they haven't been able to invalidate DGLY's patents. I think this ends with a buyout of DGLY in the $10-15 range. I think AAXN may take a temporary hit to the stock price but once the uncertanty has been removed, the sly is the limit."
We are now down about $15 over two days on really low volume.A decent report and this jump $25..

"AXON has spent the last decade expanding from a small Taser-producing company into one of the most influential companies in law enforcement. But the groundwork is being laid for an even bigger expansion. - Body cameras produced by Axon give law enforcement the ability to capture video evidence for later analysis. They are part of a broader long-term goal of being a data gathering, data storage, and analytics software provider for first responders and law enforcement. The various initiatives underway will make the company more of a technology platform for its customers and they will drive the company's growth and development over the next decade."

"Axon slid from YTD highs after Raymond James double downgraded shares to Market Perform from Strong Buy, saying the stock's ""unsustainable energetic move higher"" this month cannot be reconciled with fundamentals of the business.Ray Jay analyst Brian Gesuale notes the stock had rallied ~50% in the last few weeks, some of which can be chalked up to short covering and a technical breakout.But Gesuale says it is hard to know when those catalysts will run their course and the stock's positive momentum will reverse."
The George Floyd police reform act is set to be voted on this week in the House. it mandates ALL federal law enforcement have body cams. provides grants for state and local body cams. and directs empathy based training. This is going to be huge for AXON! These three aspects of the bill have large bipartisan support in both House and Senate.
"From San Jose CA Spotlight article“Every sworn SJPD officer currently has the Axon Taser Conducted Electrical Weapon (CEW). The ""less-than-lethal weapon"" delivers an electric charge that targets the nerves controlling movement. The taser is used to ""incapacitate armed and combative subjects"" during mid-range conflicts, even if that person does not feel any pain, Tindall said.A National Institute of Justice report found taser-related deaths to be rare, but they were more likely to happen if the individual was under the influence or had an underlying health condition.Unlike the CEW, a new taser model called Taser 7 has two cartridges: one that fires long-range darts and another which fires at a closer range. A second cartridge is helpful if an officer misses the target and needs to fire a second round. Tindall said a second cartridge can help an officer avoid more violent tactics should the taser fail.""The field test group has already reported positive results with this feature, including one deployment against a violent male who was in crisis and threatening officers with improvised weapons,"" Tindall said.According to a report by Tindall, the Taser 7 hit the person at a greater distance than previous models used by SJPD. The man hit did not suffer significant injuries as no additional force was necessary to detain him.Valdez said one silver lining to new taser technology is that Taser 7 alerts supervisors when activated and uploads data including officer name and badge number along with the number of trigger pulls and intensity of shock.The City Council on Dec. 1 approved a contract for getting more of these tasers.”"
"Axon's response to Spruce Point article:“Spruce Point Capital put out a poorly researched report that is riddled with inaccuracies and innuendos. While short sellers seek to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt in hopes of knocking our stock down to make a short-term profit, Axon is focused on long-term solutions such as making the bullet obsolete, improving police-community relations and enabling a fairer justice system. There are three key themes in the report to which we would like to respond: Axon’s accounting practices and SEC disclosures are sound:Axon did not increase its line of credit without filing an 8-K, as Spruce Point alleges. We filed one on January 7, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069183/000106918319000010/a8-kxjpmcreditagreement.htmOur capital raise, as we’ve said repeatedly, was designed to strengthen our balance sheet ahead of the TASER 7 launch. Selling hardware on a subscription, where customers pay over time, is a use of operating cash, as investors know.The “recently reported” material weakness was in 2016, nearly three years ago, and was remediated by the end of 2017.The reason the reserve as a percent of inventory has increased is because we have been much more efficient with managing our inventory, so the denominator (gross inventory) has decreased by 33% since Q2’17.Axon’s segment reporting is in accordance with GAAP, which is to disclose segments consistent with how management looks at the business and has been consistently disclosed in our filings.Axon does not have discretion to decide the timing and value of revenue recognition. Both are dictated by applying U.S. GAAP to our products and services. We do not claim that bundles have “stand-alone” value. Within our bundles, we have performance obligations (promises to transfer goods and services to our customers) that are “distinct.” In the Taser 60 plan, the hardware is in fact a distinct good, which is why we recognize the value of that hardware when it is transferred to the customer.Axon does not have a “choice” to recognize hardware revenue upfront in the same way that Apple does not have a “choice” to recognize iPhone sales when they deliver the iPhone hardware. The timing of recognition is dictated by U.S. GAAP.Customer billing statements do not dictate a company’s GAAP revenue recognition, and everyone with basic accounting knowledge knows this. The stated value of an individual good or service in a bundled contract is irrelevant for revenue recognition. The customer in those transactions is paying a bundled price. The value that matters for revenue recognition is the standalone selling price, which we use to allocate the price customers pay for the bundle to the distinct promises in the contract.Axon is actively mitigating China exposure:Axon is not concealing the fact that it has suppliers in China. Indeed, our annual conflict minerals report includes substantial disclosure of source locations, including China. As far as the impact of tariffs on the company, like all companies with imports subject to recent tariff increases, Axon is managing through the impact of these developments by negotiating aggressive discounts with suppliers and in some circumstances shifting production to other countries.Axon feels great about our ability to disrupt the police Records Management Systems and Computer Aided Dispatch markets:Axon has been very transparent about the competitive landscape in RMS and CAD. Indeed, Spruce Point’s competitor list could have been lifted right from Axon’s 10-K, where we list out competitors by name. We feel great about our market positioning and intend to execute.”https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/investors-dont-find-short-sellers-claims-credible-759114/"

"Does anyone have any doubt this stock will be over $10B market cap? The only question is when. I personally think within 2 years. All this recurring revenue keeps going higher and higher. More cities keep adding bodycams to their police officers. City after city, town after town. All the ancillary business once they add a bodycam creates a financial windfall from the ripple effect. All the recurring revenue is essentially locked in with contracts and high switching costs. It is also a pain in the neck. Which company would you switch to? Digital Ally??? There is no competition. Look at who your customers are, LE. Taxes will just be raised to pay the bills if money becomes any type of issue for these absolutely essential products and services. Bear market, bull market, this stock is set. This is the best story I have ever seen in a stock in my life."
This stock has given investors so many chances to buy on the cheap. Right now is another one of those chances. Do you really think this will stay at a 3.5B market cap for long?

Rumor has it that AXON is partnering with an Israeli company ( investing 90 mil) that does forensic intrusion & analysis of cellphone data as well as digital evidence management which every law enforcement agency in the country will have to use.

""The City Board of Directors was generous enough to approve the purchase late last year,"" Mitchell said. ""It will be paid for through funds acquired from the city's share of federal asset forfeitures, so it's not costing the taxpayers anything.""""The cameras will add a layer of transparency, which is necessary for 21st Century policing, and it also will highlight the great work our officers are already doing,"" Mitchell stated. ""It's going to be an invaluable training tool as well for current and future recruits.""According to AXON's website, each device and app work seamlessly together, and when you draw your taser or weapon, its signal technology alerts your Axon camera so it can begin capturing vital footage.From there, that footage easily uploads to a website where law enforcement can quickly view and organize it as well as use additional tools for transcription, redaction, and more, according to their website. The Fort Smith Police Department post on Facebook said:""Almost there! The Fort Smith Police Department welcomes the arrival of 80 AXON body cameras and thanks to the Board of Directors and especially You, the citizens of Fort Smith, for providing us with these resources to help deliver the best level of service possible.""Some people who commented on the FSPD Facebook page seemed to be pleased that police may have more protection.Some of the comments included: ""Fantastic!!

Any thoughts on why AXON's market cap keeps growing despite no earnings? Love the revenue growth but this is a 20 year old company that is still not profitable. Any help appreciated.

"Murrieta City Council approves body-worn cameraThe details of a Murrieta Police Department request for new body-worn cameras for all line officers to wear on patrol are being formulated by the department after winning tentative approval of the Murrieta City Council Jan. 15.City Councilman Jonathan Ingram said the proposal will come back to the council for final approval soon.The request made by Murrieta Police Capt. Rob Firmes and approved by Chief Sean Hadden asked for Axon’s Evidence.com body-worn cameras as the best choice for the program. The department has been using several different body-worn cameras for 14-months to study their effectiveness and found it to be the best practice to the Murrieta Police and other police agencies that “embrace community-oriented policing and transparency.”The cameras were worn by selected sworn officers in the 14-month test period. Those officers were members of a committee formed in 2017. Their job was to evaluate the various vendor cameras in the field in an effort to identify the unit which would meet the departments’ needs and expectations, according to the report.The body-worn camera program was earlier identified as the best practice for Murrieta’s community-oriented police departments. The use of body-worn camera videos to capture the actions of police officers on the job that has had a positive effect on prosecution efforts by the District Attorney’s Office, jurors, judges and prosecutors. It showed how the department’s officers consistently exhibited professional behavior in their law enforcement duties.They also gave administrative officers the ability to review critical and high-profile incidents that clarify the police actions that had been taken by personal recording devices that sometimes are taken out of context or capture only part of the encounter.During the 14-month trial period, the officers used the systems of Axon Evidence, GoPro Intrensic and Lenslock. Each system provided two main components to their systems; hardware and software.At the conclusion of trials, the committee recommended the selection of Axon’s Evidence.com. The reason for the recommendation centered on the company’s exceptional video and audio quality, superior battery life, simple operation with no delay when activated, user-friendly and highly customized digital management software, mobile application for tagging an uploading evidence in the field and secure chain of custody and sharing of digital evidence with the district attorney’s office and other agencies.https://www.myvalleynews.com/story/2019/01/25/news/murrieta-city-council-approves-body-worn-camera-vendor-agreement/64335.html"
"I just don't understand how someone would want to sell this stock right now unless they really needed the money. Even if the stock drops 10 or 15 points on profit-taking by large institutions it's eventually going to go back up because they got the corner on the body camera market and taser. It's now a big player in the mkt.No longer is axon a 2bit stock, it is now in the big leagues.in the coming yrs it will continue to grow, so why shop around? And that's all I have to say about that!"

OK once more for those at the back AXON makes CONNECTED wearables why would you sell off the cloud business they require?. Secondly Motorola has body cameras and in car fleet cameras connected to their cloud. they have no software or AI offerings and more importantly real time offering (respond).If your still not sure or didnt bother reading the FTC case and AXONS response you could read seeking alphas latest article.
"AXON is a technology company.....the Tesla of law enforcement high tech. What matters is the services it sells, more so than the tasers and body cameras. IMHO. Be patient as the stock price will reach new highs."

"Does Axon really want this patent case to go to court? Digital has a market cap of less than 40m and is asking for 200m. Do they want to trust a judge or even worse a jury? Not the same thing, but look what happened to Windstream when everyone thought they would win their case and the judge decided differently."
How large is the DEA and other government groups that must follow suit - the addressable market? Do you have any estimate of the proceeds?

"For longtime AAXN fans:2 weeks ago I had a conversation and demonstration of the Taser gun, camera, controller, in car real time notebook suspended from the ceiling, and automatic charging/downloading of video. (the camera and controller were not AAXN but another manufacturer I had never heard of). This young officer in Boca Raton was very enthused as he was explaining everything from an operational perspective. However the most interesting comment he made was what the PO's thought about what was going to happen before using the equipment and after several months of actual usage. The vast majority of PO's thought that there would be many instances where officers would get in trouble during arrests for using too much force, unethical tactics, etc. But just the opposite has happened. When an arrestee makes a claim against a PO the police dept views the video and again, the vast majority turn out to be frivolous claims which are immediately dropped when confronted by the video.Turns out that the video has become the PO's best friend instead of their worst enemy.No wonder he was so enthused."

"Would anyone care to enunciate the AAXN shareholder's point of view regarding the following matters?1. Axon Signal Technology patent has never been granted, and has a priority date 3 years after DGLY's '495 and '292 which it is an exact copy of. Here's their patent application: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170367049A1/en?oq=+20170367049 2. Someone mentioned AAXN's ""ICOP 20-20w"" dash cam technology earlier, which is old news. AAXN already had auto-activation technology before DGLY! Unfortunately, it was useless as it didn't solve the main problem that body camera's were created to solve.As I said before, DGLY's patent is not simply a signal for one camera to activate, it is an ecosystem of linked cameras to activate once in range of the triggered camera. So, AAXN's ""ICOP 20-20w"" dash cam technology would activate with a light bar, sure. But this has nothing to do with body cameras or the true implications of auto-activation and the scope of DGLY's VuLink technology. The need for body cameras came out of a need for greater transparency. One dash cam does not provide this. Only multiple cameras from multiple perspectives and multiple units arriving at the scene can come close to providing the full picture. How do you capture all of that video evidence automatically without each camera needing to be activated individually? DGLY's patent.The reason that AAXN's ""ICOP 20-20w"" didn't hold up as prior art with the USPTO is because the technology did not include a second signal that was sent back to a recording device manager which would then activate all other cameras that were already in range or would come into range while the camera was on. Read about it here: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ptab-filings%2FIPR2017-00375%2F513. Why does AAXN have $300mm+ suddenly in cash on its balance sheet, while $75mm was the most it ever held previously according to annual filings? Maybe for a buyout? Like how they bought out VIEVU no more than 6 months after DGLY entered into an exclusive supply agreement with them. Funny coincidences, huh?I just can't wait for justice to be served."

Using both of the systems will also allow for one storage location for all videos.Wegener said the next step will involve the body cameras being used for about a month to make sure officers are comfortable using the system, and to answer any questions they may have.

"(Previous Post 21 days ago) If you own Aaxn or Dgly shares you would be wise to get a copy of the Seeking Alpha Sept 13, 2018 report ETC. PART 2. I was advised to give a comment or interpretation on the following 2 recent events. (1) Dgly new EVO-HD technology and (2) Aaxn drops the appeal to Dgly auto activation feature built into its body worn cameras.The new EVO-HD technology (alluded to in my previous post) means that Dgly body cameras are far superior to Aaxn products and sooner or later police departments will come to realize this.Dgly patents have now become more valuable and adds another compelling reason for Aaxn to seek a buyout solution, preferably one share of Aaxn for one share of Dgly.Aaxn drops the appeal. This is just common sense in light of all the facts surrounding this case. When Aaxn was testing and patenting it's stun gun, Dgly was working, improving and patenting their body worn cameras. (I remember CNBC (?) showing a clip of this demonstration by Dgly many years ago.) Besides, what good is a body worn camera without this auto activation feature. Aaxn will plead ""no contest"" if this point is brought up in court.The Aaxn board of directors was given bad legal advise years ago. The lawyers should have recommended paying a small license fee, instead they have this better than you ATTITUDE, (money talks, BS walks). You can almost hear them back then, we will stall, postpone and do everything to run Dgly out of business, including selling our body worn cameras below cost, or practically giving them away on a trial basis and to do anything to get a contract. (LAPD and NYC contracts are examples).Their business decisions violate antitrust laws including the Sherman Act and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) , unreasonable restraint of trade, monopolization, unfair methods of competition. The Clayton Act bans certain discriminatory prices or services and also authorizes parties to sue for enhanced (TRIPLE) damages when they have been harmed by conduct that violates either the Sherman or Clayton Act. (note) To prove willful INTENT, one must look at the result of the action involved in the business decision. Dgly case for successful TRIPLE damages just rose from 50% to 75%.(note) Patent infringement cases are very complicated. In performing a reasonable analysis, patent damages experts often rely upon other license agreements either to determine an appropriate royalty rate or as a check against another form of reasonable royalty methodology. We also expect to see a renewed focus on willful infringement and enhanced damages as the District courts and Federal Circuit courts begin to apply the Supreme Courts ""Halo"" decision.Why did Aaxn go from mid to high 20's to over 70. Read the quarterly reports, do a financial analysis, check the charts with dates relating to Aaxn news bulletins (omitting possible bad news) and important media personnel giving their personal opinions. By putting all this information together like a puzzle, you will get the classic ""pump and dump""ADVISE to Aaxn shareholders. DO NOT SELL. Contact the Aaxn department of investor relations (If you can get thru) and request they settle this dispute with Dgly (one for one) BEFORE it goes to court which I believe will be mid April. I DO NOT have inside information but my gut feelings tell me there are one or possibly two companies looking to make a bid for Dgly.If I was a paid consultant, I would recommend Motorola Solutions (MSI) for two important reasons. (1) Dgly and MSI existing products would be a perfect fit. (2) MSI has financial strength, a strong cash flow and experience in dealing with patent infringement cases. They can buy out Dgly and take over the Dgly infringement case ( a distinct possibility without being accused of ""trolling"") and if this chain of events happens, beware Aaxn, your stock could possibly drop like a rock down to as low as 15.00 per share."
Is there any evidence the company will bring more to the bottom line this time? Does anyone know if we made money?
AAXN has a secret: They can not win the Patent Infringement case against DGLY but don't tell anyone they are trying to keep it from their shareholders.

"Despite Digital Ally’s repeated misstatements in its recurring press releases, this case is not about auto-activation. Auto-activation of cameras is not new and was not invented by Digital Ally. Indeed, TASER publicly disclosed the use of a police car light bar to wirelessly activate body worn cameras as early as 2008—a full five years before Digital filed its ‘452 patent application. Instead, the patented technology at issue allows law enforcement agencies to identify and assemble video evidence from multiple in-car and body-worn cameras related to the same event. Axon separately developed patent-pending technology called “Slate” to accomplish the same end, but by completely different and non-infringing means. Axon’s system does not use information from the accused Axon Signal Unit (“ASU”) to link videos. Instead, Axon uses Slate beacons sent between cameras wholly independent from the ASU to identify videos of the same event. Importantly, Slate is not an accused product in the litigation.On January 31, 2019, Axon moved for summary judgment that (1) it does not infringe Digital Ally’s ‘452 patent, the sole remaining patent in the case, and (2) there is no “willful infringement” (and thus no mechanism for triple damages) because Digital sued Axon on the same day the ‘452 patent issued and Axon has maintained reasonable non-infringement and invalidity positions throughout the litigation. In fact, only 1 of Digital's original 8 claims against Axon remains for judicial resolution. All of Digital’s antitrust and unfair competition claims were dismissed by the district court, which was affirmed on appeal. Digital also was forced to dismiss its infringement claims concerning a second ‘292 patent, and granted Axon a covenant not to sue under that patent on existing Axon products. Even on the remaining '452 patent, Digital has abandoned all but one of its infringement theories and dropped all claims of lost profits based on Axon’s sales of the accused products. Thus, the court file tells a completely different story than Digital’s media campaign.Axon also moved for summary judgment that Digital Ally is not entitled to alleged and overstated “convoyed sales” damages for non-accused, undisputedly non-infringing products, including Axon’s award-winning digital evidence management cloud-based software solution “Evidence.com” developed, launched and commercially successful long before Digital filed for its ‘452 patent. Indeed, the vast majority of Digital’s alleged damages relate to unaccused products and services such as Evidence.com, warranty services, and even bundles that include TASER Smart Weapons, regardless of whether the sale also included ASUs. Because actual revenue from the accused Signal products is quite small, Digital Ally has inexplicably attempted to expand the royalty base to include every product sold by Axon’s business division. This is the only way Digital can lay claim to the extreme damage figures it routinely feeds the media and its investors. The law, however, does not support patent damages for unpatented products and services unrelated to accused ASU sales.Finally, Axon continues to maintain the invalidity of the ‘452 patent and will present that evidence at trial, should one be necessary. Despite Digital Ally’s false public statements to the contrary, the USPTO did not find the ‘452 patent valid in connection with Axon’s IPR challenges, only one of which involved Digital’s remaining litigation claims. The recent denial of Axon's petition for reconsideration of that IPR decision changes nothing. Indeed, the key prior art Axon relies on in the litigation as invalidating has never been considered by the patent office, either during prosecution of the ‘452 patent or during the IPR proceedings.Axon’s non-infringement arguments on summary judgment, if successful, are case dispositive. Should the court find a question of fact for trial on infringement, Axon’s damages arguments of no willful infringement and no convoyed sales, if successful, would greatly reduce any trial risk. Summary judgment rulings are not expected until late Fall. The court has not yet set a trial date."
"I believe in AAXN in the long term. However given the unexpected outlays and loss of tax revenues by all levels of government, I can see buying cameras taking a backseat in the short term. What will carry us through these tough times is the fact that we have been changing to a subscription model of business."

"I wouldn't be surprised if the Capitol police force makes a deal for AXON body cameras and software. I did not see body cameras being used by the CPD during the Capitol rioting, so a sale should be in the works eventually. This will be another catalyst to move the stock higher. Longs should be buying here."

"For Aaxn and Dgly interested and informed shareholders. ""Slate"", axon's term for their new system has never been mentioned in any previous material or statement by them or by VieVu which was a part of Safariland (2015) and was sold to Axon in May 2018. VieVu contains an automated video redaction technology that blurs faces and objects such as children and innocent bystanders.""Slate"" contains beacons sent between cameras. I sincerely hope these beacons are not laser beams, that would most likely infringe on some other company's patents. ""Slate"" is under ""patent pending"" which there could be a multitude of sins hiding in their proposed design. Speaking of patents, claims are found on the patent application and are parts of the patent that define specific patent protection by explaining the scope and innovation of the invention.""A picture speaks a thousand words"". This is true in the case of patent drawings as an invention can often be more easily explained through drawings than in reams of description. Accurate, clear drawings strengthen and enhance patent applications helping patent examiners to understand inventions faster. These precise images also help instruct judges in cases of patent infringement clarifying the patent owners claims and clinching the decision in their favor. Patents can be held unenforceable for inequitable conduct, such as when material prior art is intentionally withheld from the examiner. I seriously doubt this unmeritorious patent will ever be approved.I will admit, Dgly has a poor sales organization despite having an invaluable built in auto activation feature and as a result they are not as competitive as they could have been. This does not give Aaxn the right to purposely infringe Dgly patents, in fact Dgly does not have to prove malicious intent on Aaxn's part in order to prove patent infringement at trial.We now come to the subject of the suit against Aaxn board of directors and senior officers by some Aaxn shareholders employing the California law firm Glancy, Prongay, and Murray LLP.. I suspect these shareholders were deceived by the board of directors and senior officers who have violated their fiduciary duties and omitting material facts concerning the operation of their company. They have told lies and half truths to cover up the true facts. To perpetuate this pernicious situation bigger lies and a deeper cover up is necessary until a ""whistleblower"" comes out of the wood work. Game over,like the opposing team scoring a winning touchdown with no time left on the game clock. The Aaxn board of directors could consult GPM LLP and ask, where did we go wrong! In hindsight, GPM LLP could possibly reply, two years ago when confronted with the issue of auto activation patent infringement, you could have admitted guilt, agree to pay reasonable royalties and start negotiations on buying out Dgly. You know the expression, ""pennies on the dollar"". Smart and wise management would have realized Dgly patents are worth hundreds of millions of dollars in future sales. Whatever the cost to Aaxn for this takeover, whether it be 30 dollars per share or 250 million dollars, you could have gotten back twice as much in 5 years. Your stock would be over 100 by now.It is difficult to say if it is too late for such negotiations after appearing scared and desperate saying we look forward to and are confident of winning the trial, like a condemned man awaiting the executioner. Is it any wonder Aaxn is being sued by their own stockholders. A word of advice to the Aaxn board of directors. A settlement of the Dgly suit as soon as possible will not only save Aaxn money but will go a long, long way toward appeasing your disgruntled shareholders represented by GPM LLP.This is all brought about by Aaxn corporate mindset, win sales contracts at all costs. At all costs is un American, get rid of your slogan, ""The best competition is ...NO COMPETITION AT ALL!!!Don't even think about filing an appeal if this case goes to court and Aaxn loses. A court justice was quoted as saying ""lawyers should not lodge appeals that are totally without merit. Such a move wastes judicial time and public money and delays cases that deserves to be reviewed."" This justice also highlights the increasing use of incompetent legal representation as a reason for appeal which he said was groundless in many cases. Abuse of the legal system is a serious matter and is not taken lightly.I hope this message reaches the ears of competent personnel on Aaxn and Dgly board of directors. There is a saying, advice is only worth what one pays for it. It is free and well meaning advice for both parties, and sometimes can be fortuitous and prosperous. ""The pearl of wisdom is born in the seed of honesty"" Donald E."
You're going to see more European contracts. Zerohedge has coverage of the protests in France. Wouldn't surprise me if this goes parabolic by next year with elections coming up. They are now shifting to the cloud. This is the next Netflix.
"They're a long-term play. Once a department buys their camera and storage solution they're in there for years. Plus AAXN has a suite of police-related products that will ensure the department will never want to leave. They want to be the system that runs every police department in the world, and they're well on their way."
Looking Good!!

"(For the first time, all 62 Clovis Police Department patrol officers are outfitted with AXON body-worn camera.)The department’s Axon body cam system cost $104,000, which covered the cameras and the first year of cloud storage.Two grants — Community Corrections Partnership and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) — funded $69,000 of the cost. The city’s General Fund paid for the remainder.The General Fund also covers the $100,000 annual operating cost of the body cam system, Munro said.As part of a five-year contract, the department can trade in all 62 cameras for updated versions every two years.More Evidence, More TransparencyHaving access to more evidence and being more transparent are two of the reasons the department invested in the cameras, Munro said.“They allow us to show the public what’s going on,” he said. “If we have a critical incident, we can show that our officers either did the right thing or they didn’t.”Saving Time, Money, and StaffThat, in turn, saves the department time and money in investigating complaints.https://gvwire.com/2019/02/13/all-62-clovis-police-patrol-officers-outfitted-with-body-cams/"

Lots of shares traded after hours Fri pm and it looks like real trades. I'm surprised they all went through without any price change.
This is so great. Have been accumulating and trading Taser / AAXN since 2014 before Ferguson. We have a winner here. No other company in the world comes close in name or sales of body cameras. Will break out soon now that the lawsuit is behind us. Don't sweat the small down days they are an opportunity to accumulate. You made a good decision with AXON !!!

2018 Fcst ResultsI believe Axon was being conservative in their conference call when they stated 2018 growth rates of 18-20%. Third and fourth quarter revenues will easily come in at second quarter levels and more than likely higher. I believe Rick wanted to give numbers he knew the company could beat. It's always better to exceed estimates than to miss them. We are 1/2 way through the third quarter and I wouldn't be surprised to see this around $80 when third quarter results are released.
"Axon shareholders and followers. Please refer to my post on the Dgly board. It would be to Axon's benefit to agree to a settlement, One share of Aaxn for one share of dgly. See permanent injunction case (Ebay Inc. v. MerExchange LLc. In district court case of Power Integrations Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int'l the defendant competed with the plaintiff for design-win contracts that locked in business from third-parties for a period usually lasting years. The court also reasoned that the plaintiff had already lost sales and seen it's prices erode, there was a ""casual nexus"" between the patented features and the demand for the plaintiff products, and the fact that other infringing may be in the market place did not negate the irreparable harm.If Aaxn loses this case and is planning on filing an appeal, they must file a defendant appeal bond. This serves as a safety net bond which helps protect the court from frivolous appeals or delaying tactics to avoid payment as these dishonest activities cost the court time and money."

Alright!(Baltimore PD Angles for $8M for New Tasers, Camera Tech)—-*”And I quote: Axon Enterprises Inc., formerly known as Taser International Inc., is “the manufacturer’s sole authorized source of these products,” and the city Police Department's choice for the contract”*—-The police department is asking for the funds to purchase the stun guns and body cameras that activate when a gun or Taser has been fired.The Baltimore Police Department is asking the city for nearly $8 million for Tasers and software that will activate officers’ body-worn cameras when a Taser or a gun is fired.Those requests will go before the city’s five-member Board of Estimates on Wednesday.Axon Enterprises Inc., formerly known as Taser International Inc., is “the manufacturer’s sole authorized source of these products,” and the city Police Department's choice for the contract.Last year, the BOE approved an additional $6.8 million for the city’s contract with Axon, which expires in 2023 with options to renew. If the latest request is approved, it would bring total spending under the contract to around $26.5 million. That’s more than double the initial contract, awarded in March 2016, for nearly $12 million.The increasing use of Tasers by area police officers has been controversial. A 2016 investigation by The Baltimore Sun found that Baltimore police officers exceeded widely accepted safety limits for Tasers more than any other force in Maryland, and in nearly all cases fired the weapon at suspects who were not complying with police orders but did not pose a threat.Taser is the only brand of stun gun used by law enforcement in Maryland. It fires two electrified darts that incapacitate suspects long enough for them to be handcuffed.http://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Baltimore-PD-Angles-for-8M-for-New-Tasers-Camera-Tech.html"
"DGLY's CFO Tom Hickman during the latest CC: ""I would add just a couple thing. We’ve always said that the outcome of this case will dictate the competitive landscape for the future of body cameras. And I firmly believe that and I think Stan does as well. And the second thing, Taser or Axon, I guess, what they call themselves now, really has never been in this kind of position that I’m aware of. And I’ve looked back and I don’t recall ever seeing them as a defendant in a patent litigation suit. They’ve always been the aggressor, the plaintiff, and trying to protect their shock weapon patent. So this is a new shoe for them that they’re not comfortable with apparently, and they’re feeling their way as well.So I guess, what I’d like to say, at the end of the day, patents mean something, patents are costly and should be enforced. Taser use that to build their conducted weapon business, and they continue to use that. If you look, they’ve won three or four, five patent cases, put companies out of business that infringed on their conducted weapon patents. We expect the same. We have a valid patent. The patent board has rolled on it repeatedly. At the end of the day, we want to protect our patent, and hopefully, it hurts the competitors as much as Taser’s hurt the competitors in their conducted weapon business."""

"If you focus on a variable, like stock splits, you are not focus are measurable metrics. This stock is immune to inflationary pressure. Axon is always raising forecasts for the future. It has more sales every quarter and has the competitive advance of a near monopoly. Cash in bank, no debt, super strong growth. Sell high by back when the market is down, make money. Who cares if you buy 100 shares and pay 200 for a stock going to 400 or; or buy 200 shares at a hundred and its goes to 200. True investors do not invest based upon a split because in the long term, its only earnings and valuation that matters. Instead of begging the online bloggers about a stock (whom by the way) have no control over Axon stock, read Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd, or the Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Dodd. Old books that still are very useful today. In other words elevate your intellect so you are not an online beggar."

1) Where is the split rumor coming from? I'm in at $133 and want more but it's steep right now. 2) I recently resigned from a major police department after 5yrs and we used the Axon enterprise (except for report writing). I'm a huge believer in this company. Idk much about Digital Ally but after using Axon I can see it as the Shopify/Amazon of the police world.
Why doesn't Axon just buy Dgly and put this thing to rest. They would be further ahead than paying court and settlement costs.
"Will this affect AAXNAt Def Con this weekend, Josh Mitchell, a cybersecurity consultant with Nuix, showed how various models of body cameras can be hacked, tracked and manipulated. Mitchell looked at devices produced by five companies -- Vievu, Patrol Eyes, Fire Cam, Digital Ally and CeeSc -- and found that they all had major security flaws, Wired reports. In four of the models, the flaws could allow an attacker to download footage, edit it and upload it again without evidence of any of those changes having occurred.Additionally, all five devices had vulnerabilities that could let an attacker track their location or manipulate their software. In the latter's case, that could include delivering malware to the device that might eventually give an attacker access to a police network. Further, Mitchell found that the devices lacked mechanisms to verify whether recorded footage is intact, had unsecured WiFi access points and had WiFi radios that gave away too much information about the devices themselves.""With some of these vulnerabilities -- it's just appalling,"" Mitchell told Wired. ""These videos can be as powerful as something like DNA evidence, but if they're not properly protected there's the potential that the footage could be modified or replaced. I can connect to the cameras, log in, view media, modify media, make changes to the file structures. Those are big issues.""In all, the findings point to a number of serious flaws that could threaten the integrity of body camera footage and, therefore, the whole point of body cameras themselves. ""If there aren't reliable ways of ensuring that such equipment meets strong security standards, then something is deeply broken,"" ACLU Senior Policy Analyst Jay Stanley told Wired. ""No police equipment should be deployed that doesn't meet such standards."" Mitchell told Wired that he notified the five body camera companies of the issues he discovered and is working with them to close the vulnerabilities."

"In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance. They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.[2]ETAN: ""@miccar No I am a C programmer (run my own trading algos (early stages - trying to improve on profitability) and I build algo's for others- license app)…… Studied some law on my own as I was planning to go to law school at night...…..

Has AXON ever discussed getting into the home security space? I think that would catapult us to the stratosphere because right now we are limited to law enforcement with body cameras and Tasers. Home security would open the world markets to the AXON brand. Just a thought.
"Larz, Consider that a lot of mutual funds, ETF's, etc., have to follow a discipline. Micro and small-cap funds can buy AAXN stock. when it's a small cap company. Now that Axon has been added to the midcap index, those funds must divest themselves of Axon because its too big for their stated investment plan, small caps. That will create selling pressure for the stock, which as of July 1, is now a mid-cap. I think part of the selloff of Axon stock was divestiture by funds. Uncertainty regarding political negotiations and tariffs might have kept high P/E stocks from rising. If I am correct, Mid-cap funds can begin to accumulate Axon beginning July 1, 2019. That may provide support for Axon stock price or even cause it to rise. However, if facial recognition is an issue that will affect the stock price, maybe not. I am not concerned with facial recognition affecting pricing but I believe that it would be invaluable to include facial recognition in the camera software. As somebody who never has contact with the police in the official capacity, I would be unconcerned. People who always have contact with the police are very concerned. and its those persons society would want to be indentified."
"The press release, you all did notice the bottom comment right? (This press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some jurisdictions under the applicable law and ethical rules.)Good for them let them do their thing, but this does not mean it’s true and that they will find anything."
"January 2019 Axon moved for summary judgement (1) it does not infringe Dgly 452 patent, sole remaining patent in the case and (2) there is no ""willful infringement"" thus rulings no mechanism for treble damages. From Axon PR they comment that summary judgement rulings are not expected till late fall. From Dgly conference call Stan indicates that any day there could be a summary judgement ruling although he does flip back and forth that it could be in the 4th qtr. as well.A summary judgement in favor of Axon would make the case dispositive (charges thrown out) or the judgment may not find in favor of Axon. A finding not in favor of Axon does not conclude any infringement occurred or damages granted although expect Stan to release some BS press release stating ""Axon lost summary judgment."" This summary judgement is another cost effective way for Axon to defend the case instead of trial. But rest assured Axon has every intention of taking this case to trial.In regards to the USPTO it makes no difference how many times Axon was unsuccessful in invalidating the patent. Seven times, fifteen times, twenty four times. None. It's just another strategy to defend yourself against the claims against you. The USPTO is not a court of law and does not decide infringement or damages litigation.A court date for trial has not been determined yet. On the Dgly CC, Stan mentions could be 4th qtr. as well. He also indicates that he expects to incur 3-4 more qtrs. of legal fees in relation to the Axon case. This looks to run into 2020 for trial. In patent infringement cases plaintiff, (Dgly) holds the ""burden of proof"" to show the court that Axon infringed on it's patents. Just stating that the USPTO recognizes the Dgly 452 patent does not mean Axon infringed on their patent. Over the past six years the body camera business has experienced exceptional growth and what has Dgly done for it's Co. and share holders? Nothing. They claim that competitors have stolen their patents thus resulting in their lost business. No one has stopped Dgly from selling their camera's and products to anyone. For numerous qtrs. the past few years they have had delayed product launches, inventory problems, poor sales and bleeding cash. How can this happen when demand is booming? Their poor sales and lost business is no ones fault but themselves. Management failed to deliver.On to the Watchguard settlement. Stan has boasted and stated for qtrs. on the conference calls that Watchguard was going to pay for their patent infringement and Dgly is owed millions in damages. What was the result:• WatchGuard will pay Digital Ally a one-time, lump sum settlement payment of six (6) million dollars. • Digital Ally has granted WatchGuard a perpetual covenant not to sue if WatchGuard’s products incorporate agreed-upon modified recording functionality. • Digital Ally has also granted WatchGuard a license to the ’292 Patent and the ’452 Patent (and related patents, now existing and yet-to-issue) through December 31, 2023. The parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve any infringement that occurs after the license period expires. • The Parties have further agreed to release each other from all claims or liabilities pre-existing the settlement. • As part of the settlement, the parties agreed that WatchGuard is making no admission that it has infringed any of Digital Ally’s patents. This is no win, more failed management.What is wall street telling us? After the Watchguard settlement Dgly shares get a 50% haircut and trading flat. Axon approaching all time highs. The street no longer believes Stan's statements. You should not as well. This ship has been sinking and continues to sink..."

"AAXN is the co in the right place at the right time. It is practically monopolizing this space to equip police forces across the US and is expanding to Europe and Australia. Once contracted and ordered from the co, it is virtually impossible to move on to any other supplier with the same quality of equipments. This co will continue its high growth rate for quite a few years to come and share price will reflect that fact. The CEO is a man of vision. The fact he is not being paid by salary, but by stock shares says a lot of his confidence in the co and his alignment with shareholders’ interests. One can hardly find such a CEO in cos."

"Funny, I'm watching CNBC and they are all talking about how we have all been waiting for this drop to happen and how it was expected ... to far to fast ... blaa, blaa blaa. Then Monday when it starts going back up they will talk about the resilience of the markets. LOL"
"I previously had misspoken when i said i had it five yrs, i apologize for that. time goes by so quick at my age. I looked at my records and my actual purchases were in 2008, 2009 and 2013, for a total of 2000 shares at dollar cost avg of 7 dollars a share. if Cramer is right I could have a half a million dollars for my kids by year end. Never in my wildest did I think that would happen. Go Axon, I love you."
"If I recall correctly, Smith has 10 years to bring the market cap to ~12.5B where he then reaps massive compensation. We are now almost 8B. Does anyone have any doubt that this stock hits $200 by the end of 2022 and probably much sooner. #worryfreeinvesting"
"AXON is a huge buy at this price so I picked some up. Will probably pop after earnings. If it goes down after a good report, I’ll be doubling down without any question"

"Axon is amazing. If you don't have it, you don't have anything, and you hamper the effectiveness of your police force."
Is DGLY still a threat? LOLLast time I checked they were getting into the thermometer business or was it deodorant? I'm not sure.
I sat in on the Zoom meeting today. I was impressed with the cohesiveness of the group and the common goals of moving the company forward. That is a quality needed in a group to work together and be successful. Forward looking projections are very positive. I didn't add more to my portfolio only because the markets is not done going down ... I don't think. So I will wait. AXON has been very very good to me. Congratulations to all us longs we picked a winner !!!!!
"As a person that bought aaxn when it was tasr 6 yrs ago at 7. My 2000 shares have appreciated nicely, and I'm happy for my kids, because I bought it for them. I get a kick out of all the comments on this site from people who have such definite knowledge about the Mkt. As I have said before if u like a Companies product, believe in their Mgt and the future value of their product , buy it and hold it long..I think I heard Warren Buffett say that once. Go Aaxn, your great."
"Look for the ranks of law enforcement to steadily decline as experienced officers retire the second they are eligible and you couldnt get new replacements with a $1M signing bonus. Universities all over the country are dropping their criminal justice programs for lack of enrollment. The future of law enforcement is extremely bleak, which doesnt exactly bode well for companies who supply them."
