"OK guys--FMC and LTHM are down today; but let;s do the math:If you own 100 share of FMC at today's reduced share price, (e:$82.10) you have $8,210On March 1st you will then be rewarded 93 share of LTHM (e: $11.85), you'll have $1,102So, right now your combined value including spinoff is $9,313 for your 100 shares of FMC; or today $93.13/share.Now, going forward analyists have projected your 100 shares of FMC, (less spinoff) will be worth $97.00/share or $9,700Analyist are also projecting that in one year your 93 shares of LTHM will be worth $19/share or $1,767So, you projected values in one year including both stocks will be $11,467 versus today's value of $8,210--a 40% return plus the 1.9% dividend you'll get from fMC.Hold on and reap the benefits of this spinoff"
"Earnings okay, but I was looking for more. Outlook okay, but maybe a bit less than expected. I would think this stock should be flat to down, with a downward bias for a while IMHO."
"With months of sideways trading it was tempting to sell off my shares for something else. But, I let my brain do the investing and not my emotions and my brain recognizes all the problems that Covid caused in 2020 going away in 2021. My brain recognizes the extreme importance of crop protection because food is always in high hot demand as population increases. Food shortages in countries can occur making it paramount that countries experiencing good crop conditions ensure their crops are protected and ensure they are making ever more crops. FMC remains a strong buy type of a stock in my personal I just like the stock opinion, not financial advice as I am not a professional."
I’ve come to understand that FMC has the highest quality lithium. This is due to the technology they purchased from John Burba CEO of international batteries and Metals. Is this true? Does anyone have info on this?
FMC--smashes thru projections for the last quarter. Going forward some material cost concerns; but these problems will be resolved. This stock is a great stock to hold; and I am going to hang on to my LTHM will will be spun off from FMC. I don't see anything taking over lithium batteries on a commercial scale for a while. Hang on for the ride up.

As Er said the most of the stocks are down on good results news - cash taken out for holidays?
What a great opening. I read the main reason their sales were off is of a drought in Brazil.
"Hey, does FMC still mine lithium as one of their other working sectors?Thanks"
"Just went Long 100 shares FMC at $84.60. Looking for a significant pop up for this solid, undervalued stock in a safe sector, based on a very good earnings report in a few minutes, with positive EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. We shall see if I am finally right, in a few minutes... :-)"
"does anyone know if I bought shares of FMC yesterday 10/10/18, will I get shares of the spinoff IPO?"
Good ReportsSeaport & Citigroup have upgraded FMC to a BUY. The 2.2 BUY rating is predicted for all of 2018.
For what it’s worth I am considering picking up some more shares tomorrow. I have been holding for years now and think picking up some more will be good.
The run up to get shares of the IPO.
So VERY underpriced given the earnings beat and story.
Major downturn in ag related companies. This is a great stock at a great price. buy at this level---also take a look at SMG and CF---all at bargain basement----for a bit more spice take a look at bayry
"On Dec 3, 2018: (1) FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC) says it will increase its quarterly dividend to $0.40/share from $0.165/share and authorizes a new $1B share repurchase program. (2) FMC says the moves are part of a capital allocation plan to return up to $4.5B to shareholders in the next five years."
Awesome earnings report. 98 EPS versus 93 EPS. 1 Billion in Revenue. $200 Million share buyback. March 1st date set for the rest of the spinoff going to shareholders. FMC is aqesome long term investment.
any idea what it is going on???? It doesn't make any sense
Class action (cancer)) against Syngenta. Other ag stocks caught in downdraft ?
