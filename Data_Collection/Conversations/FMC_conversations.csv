FMC reacting to earnings the way it should have done. Earnings beats shouod be rewarded not punished.
Great earnings!
FMC is up 4.90% to 84.29
"SANTIAGO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) refused to increase the lithium production quota for U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, which had already gotten approval for an increase from a national development agency, a local newspaper said on Saturday."
Food Shortage in China. Possible Spring demand for Crop Protection could lift earnings significantly.
We'll get approximately .93 shares of LTHM for each share of FMC that we own. That works for me.
Picked up another 1000 shares this morning at 112.90
FMC is up 8.05% to 69.35
FMC--smashes thru projections for the last quarter. Going forward some material cost concerns; but these problems will be resolved. This stock is a great stock to hold; and I am going to hang on to my LTHM will will be spun off from FMC. I don't see anything taking over lithium batteries on a commercial scale for a while. Hang on for the ride up.
For what it’s worth I am considering picking up some more shares tomorrow. I have been holding for years now and think picking up some more will be good.
Class action (cancer)) against Syngenta. Other ag stocks caught in downdraft ?
"Stop it already! Wanted to buy more shares but as share price goes higher, money to buy shares buys less shares."
The whole Li mining sector is down not sure why that is when there is so much demand for Li
Why did FMC drop so much today?
Swarms of Locusts from Africa to China and who knows what else damaging crops. Crop protective Ag products are in super high demand right now. If there exists no waybyo deal withocusts then companies like FMC have the opportunity to try and find an answer. This is probably one of the hottest sectors of the world's economy right now.
Why down so much?
So what is going to happen with FMC's stock when they split off the Lithium Unit in an IPO?
Major downturn in ag related companies. This is a great stock at a great price. buy at this level---also take a look at SMG and CF---all at bargain basement----for a bit more spice take a look at bayry
"Hey, does FMC still mine lithium as one of their other working sectors?Thanks"
"FMC Earnings release missed Whisper Number expectations of 2.5 Googleplex of Revenue and 12 Trillion per share Non GAAP EPS. Well, maybe next time???"
Please any clue what it is going on and why is -11 in a month? I can't see any bad news or any news at all.Anyone?
FMC reached an all time high at 109.95
Who all is going to sell their shares of LTHM in March?

The premarket looks very good this morning for FMC.
"OK guys--FMC and LTHM are down today; but let;s do the math:If you own 100 share of FMC at today's reduced share price, (e:$82.10) you have $8,210On March 1st you will then be rewarded 93 share of LTHM (e: $11.85), you'll have $1,102So, right now your combined value including spinoff is $9,313 for your 100 shares of FMC; or today $93.13/share.Now, going forward analyists have projected your 100 shares of FMC, (less spinoff) will be worth $97.00/share or $9,700Analyist are also projecting that in one year your 93 shares of LTHM will be worth $19/share or $1,767So, you projected values in one year including both stocks will be $11,467 versus today's value of $8,210--a 40% return plus the 1.9% dividend you'll get from fMC.Hold on and reap the benefits of this spinoff"
Earnings beat! It seems FMC deserves better price action!
Back to making 52 week highs!!!
Will current shareholders get shares of the lithium IPO?
Is FMC dropping off the cliff because of the spinoff. They are retaining still a lot of LIVENT shares. I can not find any good research on lithium. One side sees EV demand continuing to increase and also the price of Li. The other side says there is over production of Li and the demand and price will go down. So far the bottom of the Li market is falling. I hate loosing money...
After closing bell earnings report that apparently the investor community isn't even going to notice....crickets crickets crickets.... FMC would havento do a special investor tour like a new IPO company does just to inform people they are out there doing great things.
FMC is up 5.01% to 76.77
What's private investor consensus on FMC vs SMG? I'm conflicted on which to make long term investment. I know that SMG does a lot of sales for marijuana business. As more states allow recreational MMJ use stock should grow.... I don't think analysts have MMJ play priced into SMG target ceiling.
FMC is down -4.92% to 81.50
Looks like we have hit a little head wind this quarterly report caused by the pandemic and S. American drought. All temporary. We will probably see a little dip in price.
I see a double top - anybody else see this !!!!!
Marlet down 400+pts. Awesome timing to receive Livent Shares.
This was USWMO's 21st pick for 2020!

Another incredibly strong earnings report from FMC!
This stock has the Jim Cramer Seal of approval. All attempts by anyone else to be bullish on this stock must pay a licensing fee to Jim Cramer.
I posted weeks ago. This is a great company. I am surprised there is not more interest in it. We are finally getting away from the Trump factor and increasing in value once again.
NRG Metals just released new sampling data and its looking good check out NRGMF
FMC is up 4.93% to 121.73
Farmers planting the most grow crops ever. Great for FMC.
"So when a company spins off a business to a new IPO, shareholders receive sharea of the new business based on how things are worked out. The original company's share price will drop to a lower price based on no longer having that business being part of the market cap. But, as I said shareholders lose out on nothing as we receive appropriate amount of shares of the new IPO to offset the price drop.I could be wrong but that is how this ignkrant individual investor understands things."
"this is why fmc is down.. alb down big too.Chile's Corfo, SQM reach agreement in lithium dispute https://seekingalpha.com/news/3323513?source=ansh $SQM, $ALB"
I’ve come to understand that FMC has the highest quality lithium. This is due to the technology they purchased from John Burba CEO of international batteries and Metals. Is this true? Does anyone have info on this?
Target is high 90’s...and with china agreeing to buy ag prods...fmc will be the beneficiary indirectly
Another 1K invested into FMC with another 1K soon to follow before earnings.
any idea what it is going on???? It doesn't make any sense
Thank you FMC for another divi raise. I will definitely be increasing my stake in 2021 in FMC. This is a great company to have in your Long Retirement account.
New to the stock and I make some analysis but also believe people opinion is important. What do you think about the future of that one? Is it a good one to buy and forget.
Could this drop today have to do with DWDP earnings?
FMC is down -4.92% to 78.53
Nobody here.....that's fine.. I will continue to sit back collect divide nd payments and enjoy my expanding profitable portfolio of investments. Boring investments like FMC are great. Big Strong corporations operating in a sector AGRICULTURE that will always be in increasing demand.
Insider Monkey 20 some days ago asked if FMC is a good buy now.....well gee I donno....is a stock that keeps raising their dividend and share price keeps reaching new all time highs a good buy? Wracking my brain on this one real hard here.........
FMC continues to trade based on Lithium prices which are jumping up today.
Back to $60?
FMC is down -5.10% to 89.07
So VERY underpriced given the earnings beat and story.
Grain prices continue to rise as China buys all the world's grain. Ag chemicals are going to be huge worldwide.
Corn hit $6 today. Big profits and growth for FMC
Any news?
Over $600 million of debt paid off. EPS goes higher as debt is paid off due to decreased interest expense. All.of those articles cautioning investors about FMC's debt seem inconsequential now. Tarrif wars with China don't seem to be as impactful as Wall Streeters have been making it out to be. Share price being held down for too long. I see $90s in our near future clearly. Perhaps $100 by February if not sooner.
IS anyone still here ? ???? I can't see any postings for a couple of months
I guess the stock is done floppin around like a fish out of water. The paramedics will be called back.
"Insider Money article.is hillarious. .ainstream media predicting / hoping for imminent recession ever since Trump won 2016 election. Because that would hurt Trump. so Insider money pats themselves on the back when it finally happens. Meanwhile, I will be biying up the shares of stock of FMC Corp that the Hedge Funds dumped....since this recession will be a short one."
Good ReportsSeaport & Citigroup have upgraded FMC to a BUY. The 2.2 BUY rating is predicted for all of 2018.
"Earnings okay, but I was looking for more. Outlook okay, but maybe a bit less than expected. I would think this stock should be flat to down, with a downward bias for a while IMHO."
"Hello, anyone home. I am surprised no one is on to this company. It is decent."
FMC is up 4.90% to 87.83
Credit Suisse Maintains outperform rating.
FMC or ALB? I select ALB. ALB is a leader.
April every bit as rainy as predicted as Wheat prices continue to be super hot...Jumping today alone up almost 2%. This is good news for FMC's lrofit margins as their crop products go higher in price when wheat goes higher.
FMC has its moments where it just trades sideways for weeks and perhaps months. That is just its resting period and perfectly normal. New 52 week highs are created when money starts rotating into agriculture stocks. FMC and companies like it only need to keep performing well....the share price will follow performance over time. It is called patience. Get frustrated over FMC going sideways for 2 months then you are liable to sell off your stake prior to the next move up.
Very good quarterly statement. This sell on the news is a frequent play of day traders who want to secure the stock at a lower price. I doubled my position at closing. Hang on and maybe think about selling it when it hits $120
"If FMC announced that ER and Jeff are the only shareholders, I would believe it. A beat and raise earnings report attracting nobody to the stock forum to talk about it...save a Yahoo robot."
"Just went Long 100 shares FMC at $84.60. Looking for a significant pop up for this solid, undervalued stock in a safe sector, based on a very good earnings report in a few minutes, with positive EPS, Revenue, and Guidance. We shall see if I am finally right, in a few minutes... :-)"
opit investora
Any news or up dates on the spin off?
"does anyone know if I bought shares of FMC yesterday 10/10/18, will I get shares of the spinoff IPO?"
What a great opening. I read the main reason their sales were off is of a drought in Brazil.
Does anyone have any idea how many shares of LTHM we will get at the time when it is spun off from FMC?
Awesome earnings report. 98 EPS versus 93 EPS. 1 Billion in Revenue. $200 Million share buyback. March 1st date set for the rest of the spinoff going to shareholders. FMC is aqesome long term investment.
It looks like somebody is manipulating the lithium stocks. Or the stories about there being a much better battery technology is being taken seriously.
"Is someone know when FMC separate their Lithium division to Different name, Livent, how can I switch my FMC stocks to Livent Stocks?"
No surprise.on the reaction here to the earnings report. If we go with a maximum 28 P/E for FMC then the share price should be around $111. Arguably higher than that taking into account the share repurchase program could justify $112 as a fair reasonable price. A d this opinion disregards any impacts as a result of China lifting tarrifs on U.S. imports.or any other macro economic impacts that could.impact currencies.
"is this one worth buying? what should i do? any advise? I am thinking about buying in, financials are good.. to my understanding, but it didnt seem like have been moving so much on the stock price... what do you guys think?"
Goldman Raises FMC target https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/08/06/goldman-sachs-raises-price-targets-on-4-sizzling-stocks-that-crushed-earnings/
Another 52 week high! And no fanfare or parade or anybody around to celebrate it....
I don't understand why this stock not skyrocketing? they publish good reports Q3.
As Er said the most of the stocks are down on good results news - cash taken out for holidays?
S&P came.out raising their outlook on FMC from stabke to positive meaning in 1 or 2 years they could raise the comoanies credit rating based on EBIDA. I wonder if that jounalist / analyst that wrote that article claiming FMC had too much debt and it was dangerous to have that much debt still has his job?
"With months of sideways trading it was tempting to sell off my shares for something else. But, I let my brain do the investing and not my emotions and my brain recognizes all the problems that Covid caused in 2020 going away in 2021. My brain recognizes the extreme importance of crop protection because food is always in high hot demand as population increases. Food shortages in countries can occur making it paramount that countries experiencing good crop conditions ensure their crops are protected and ensure they are making ever more crops. FMC remains a strong buy type of a stock in my personal I just like the stock opinion, not financial advice as I am not a professional."
"FWIW, all 13 stocks in my portfolio are red. Most had good quarterlies."
The run up to get shares of the IPO.
"fmc getting taken down....is this a set up for a strong run into earnings?? hmmmm,,,"
"On Dec 3, 2018: (1) FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC) says it will increase its quarterly dividend to $0.40/share from $0.165/share and authorizes a new $1B share repurchase program. (2) FMC says the moves are part of a capital allocation plan to return up to $4.5B to shareholders in the next five years."
Hello...Anybody home? Isn’t the stock market a fun game to play? Especially recently. No stability even with well functioning companies. Be safe Be well.
I do think that FMC should trim back their dividend payouts to ensure they can pay off their debt during the recession period.
What happened after market?
You still here Jeff ! I still can’t believe I just stumbled onto this company years ago. When they announced they were spinning off their lithium section I bought more to get more “free” stocks. As you remember everything was great till a lithium surplus was revealed and the price plummeted. When the price was down I continued to buy more of the lithium stock. I feel like I lucked out this time. GL everybody.Be safe.Be well.
New crop control initiated using enzymes. Seems interesting and promising.
FMC stock is for longs not shorts
Earnings beat 1.76 compared to 1.54 est.
"g everyone to sell (Zacks rank #4 Sell) FMC ahead of earnings report and saying not to expect a earnings beat because their ESP model shows an ESP of 0.00 which is not positive. Zacks had a earnings per share prediction of $1.53. Remind me again why Zacks is even still around? They won't bother to explain whatbtheir ESP model even is. They suggest it is inconclusive to expect an earnings beat despite a knowledging that thenpast several quarters of earnings have all been beats. Huh????? I have the wrong day job. I would love tonwork for Zacks, be incredibly wrong all.of the time a d still get paid."
FMC reached an all time high at 118.17
FMC is up 4.95% to 106.72
"Feels good knowing I bought more shares yesterday into the overdone 3% dip in share price. At $82.xx in my ignorant personal non-prpfessional, just an individ..investor's opinion...That was a screaming buy. Seriously Mr. Market? Pricing FMC down 13% from the high was insanity. Just going to profit off the insanity everytime it happens. The possible buyout of Lithium division offer is just a signal to the simple fact that this coming IPO is highly desierable by the business community regardless of how Mr. Market treats it."
Zoom! Zoom!................!
"Albemarle +4% as Goldman Sachs calls lithium selloff overdone https://seekingalpha.com/news/3367843?source=ansh $ALB, $FMC, $SQM"

So I take it the earnings report was kinda ok???
FMC reached an all time high at 108.37
"well we have backed off our yearly all time high. The exports are being affected slightly, be it the tariffs or the beginning of a world slow down. I see no reason to sell my shares. For such a solid company the dividends could be better."

Crazy market reaction. Ag stock have an amazing profit outlook into next quarter. Farmers are planting every acre they can with corn at $8 and soy at$16 a bushel. FMC hits $150 a share on next quarter.
Still not many people following this company. It has been good for me for several years. I even received some of Livent when they spun it off. I own lots of it now too with the lithium demand increasing.
