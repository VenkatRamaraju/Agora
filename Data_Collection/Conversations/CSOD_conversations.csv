"Rivulet Capital took a 5% stake in CSOD. They filed with the SEC on March 18th when the stock was at $22. That’s the floor for this stock. I’ve followed Rivulet and before that OSS,and they don’t take a stake unless they think a stock can double or triple within 2-3 years."

Almost 16 k shares traded after hours. Not typical for CSOD.
It was over $63 Jan 2020 - recovering slow but now with Saba should go above. I’m sticking for at least $65.

$57.50 is daylight robbery. The acquisition apparently has the backing of major shareholders. Based on the press release I assume that includes Rivulet and the other recent 5+% holder whose name eludes me. Really surprised they’d agree to that price.

I thought the quarter was not bad. Maybe the G&A was higher than expected. This company needs to be bought by somebody.
