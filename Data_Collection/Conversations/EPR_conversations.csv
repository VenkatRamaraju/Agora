HELLO AGAIN 200 WMA AT 52.23- IS THIS FINALLY THE TIME WE BREAK THROUGH?
Excellent news announcement: rent will be deferred- meaning they will collect it later. Liquidity is great - even if they collect NO RENT but still do the share repurchase and assume they get zero rent - the dividend could be maintained for 19 months. We all know things will get better as the country begins opening- so as I’ve said—> DIVIDEND IS SAFE!
Already above avg daily volume- that’s what we need to finally break above the 200 wma.
"It has been a long 15 month wait, but finally collecting the dividend and reinvesting it and buying more on Monday as well."
"This looks like a good company, undervalued, good dividend, why all the complaints?"
"Need some more love/traction for EPR and for Delta variant to subside! . Note the top 3 holders are 1)Blackrock, 2)Vanguard, 3)Investco. We are in good company!!!! The monthly dividend reinstated should help wake some investors up, I would think."
"Is it worth buying more now, or has it reached its top?"
what if AMC produced its own films.. similar to nflx and hulu...
what is happening.... recent seling in light of good news from AMC
GAME ON - we’ve taken the 50 dma - now onward to the 200 WMA!
"$EPR Dividend Reinstated as follows: << The Company announced today that its Board of Trustees declared a monthly cash dividend to common shareholders. The dividend of $0.25 per common share is payable on August 16, 2021 to shareholders of record on July 30, 2021, and represents an annualized dividend of $3.00 per share. >>"
"Glad I took some off the table at $55 from $23 but folks, we are going to $75 plus within a year stay the course. This is almost a cash position for me I played the covid fear so well. Unless of course we have another big money liberal scam and have to muzzle up!! But hey hindsight is we know JPOW prints like a madman. Hold strong."
Nice to see the bump up of earnings estimates. Analysts must be seeing some improvements.
"Odeon Capital says retail REITs' rebound is 'just beginning'- With net lease names already outperforming other retail REITs, Arnold flags ""significant potential upside"" for EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) and likes VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) for its nearly perfect collection rate from shuttered casinos through the pandemic."
still looking for this back to the 60's. Price Targets est 53 to 57 seem low to me. Monthly Dividend back for income investors. Earning should be good but not great. Going forward they should be great. Movie Theater exposure is my concern though.
"Interesting information from today's press release: ""... in response to the market dislocation of our stock price, our Board of Trustees has authorized a limited share repurchase program which we will selectively deploy while carefully considering our liquidity position."""
WOW- GREAT UPDATE AND WE ARE FINALLY THROUGH THE 200 WMA!
are the dividends qualified or not.
Why are we popping today?
"Very positive business update. If this continues, perhaps a bump up in dividends in the 1st quarter of 2022."
