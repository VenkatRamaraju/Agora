Right now dividend is 9.5% Better off buying shares back than paying dividend.
"Personally, I always try and buy financially sound companies when everyone else is selling. This stock is one of them. If you are millennial generations and intend to hold long term, this stock could make you millions depending on your investment. We will be able to mitigate this virus in 6-12 weeks, by the end of 2nd qtr Americans will be able to get back to their normal life - by 3rd qtr economy will be in recovery mode and by 4th qtr we shall see a robust stock market again. This time it will be a very short recession and hope we will not see another one in next 10 years. Great buying opportunity now and hold for next 10 years. Management team is very experienced and they could do both limited stock buy back and small dividends cut and that is not bad at all in long terms prospective. EPR is one of safe dividend stock based on strong balance sheet and portfolio pipeline. GLTA."
How low will we go today? Any ideas? I’m looking to add...
took on more at close! Long term hold. income!
Major tenant AMC just announced that they are issuing 500M of senior notes that bear interest of 10.5%. This very good news for EPR.
"EPR owns movie theaters and recreational venues. I don’t see any possible way their dividend can not go to zero. I’ll hold it, but it’s painful."
"Just bought at $13.33 in this deeply discounted REIT; now providing a 34% dividend yield paying monthly. I was stopped at $62.47, on 2/27/2020.This buyback increased my monthly dividend income by over 340% with no additional capital and certainly better than T-Bills or MMF. My due diligence closed about 95% of my trading portfolio in February into bonds as recession talks started to come up again.IMHO, this correction is almost over, now that this administration is considering imposing futures and option restrictions on short and naked-short trades with hefty fines – which helped start this sell off. This may be another way to help fund new citizen checks scheduled next month, Just the Facts on the current hype - decide and act accordingly:According to the CDC, the flu remains a higher threat to U.S. public health than the new coronavirus.a. April 2009 the Swine Flu pandemic hit the US. Per the CDC with an estimated 60,900,000 cases, 173,304 hospitalized and 12,469 deaths in the US alone. b. This flu season has at least 19,000,000 cases across the U.S. and led to over 10,000 deaths with 180,000 hospitalizations.c. US deaths: 2,744,248. Death rate: 849.3 deaths per 100,000 population Life expectancy: 78.6 years Infant Mortality rate: 5.87 deaths per 1,000 live births.d. As a side note; there are about 5,000,000 car accidents in the US every year causing over 37,000 deaths and over 2,000,000 of these injuries require extensive medical care with many reducing a victim’s quality of life.e. As of 3/19/2020, the US had 9,480 confirmed CORONAVIRUS cases with 155 deaths.As always do your own research and have a plan of due diligence or exit plan Cash is King only temporarily. Long and Happy Investing!"
This is more like it.........and we want our dividend back!!!!!!!
Good entry point. Bought for 1st time today. Will buy more on way up or down. See you in 3-5+ years.
Thank you EXECS for the dividend increase - this is what was needed to turn this ship around.
"Odeon Capital says retail REITs' rebound is 'just beginning'- With net lease names already outperforming other retail REITs, Arnold flags ""significant potential upside"" for EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) and likes VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) for its nearly perfect collection rate from shuttered casinos through the pandemic."
"what is wrong with this company or stock price?Since last october, EPR dropped 27% and still dropping.Only event, I recall that they sold some schools and going into recreation real estate moe so.But, 27 % drop and going into bear territory. I don't know where it is going to stop.Their dividend is great. Generally interest rates are going down ,down, however, EPR is going down also.Let us know hope, it stopsThe management should come out and calm investment community . May be explain that there is nothing has changed and profilitity is just fine.Hopefully this happens..Any explanation or comments Hopefully,"
IMO. Indicated EPR price targets vs fundamentals: Near term without AMC BK 32- 33. With AMC BK 22-24.
MM WILL DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT EPR FROM CLOSING ABOVE THE 200 WMA - let’s see if he does it again- currently 51.94.
"Unprofitable businesses are deflationary. An era of low interest rates has made capital cheap. The hurdle rate for lending it or investing it is low. So, investors and banks have been willing to provide equity and debt financing to businesses with no plans to be GAAP profitable for a very long time, like Tesla (TSLA), Uber (UBER), and so forth. Even fast-growing Netflix (NFLX) is free cash flow negative year after year and literally issues junk-rated debt to fund new content. As long as the stock price keeps going up, investors are happy and executives get paid in these unprofitable business models. And as long as companies have not had to make a profit on the products and services, even after a decade or more in operation, the prices of their products tend to be cheaper than they would be in a funding scenario that requires them to make a profit. Bear markets eventually test investor patience for structurally unprofitable businesses, if stock price appreciation is the only source of financial payback."
Pretty sure the .37c dividend will hold up considering buy backs and EPR is likely to still generate revenue and is also well balanced
"I've been buying EPR on the way down since $28 to $14. My thinking is that the owners of AMC, Cineworld (Regal's ParentCo), and Topgolf are aligned to maintain their locations through this temporary shock.AMC is majority owned by Wanda and Silver Lake - both sophisticated investors with deep pockets. I feel pretty good knowing that Silver Lake is likely working their arses off to protect their $600m stake made in 2018 - from an access to capital markets standpoint, I think they'll figure it out if needed. Cineworld (Regal's ParentCo) gives me more pause than AMC. Huge cinema chain that will absolutely be at risk across its global business. I do find a little comfort in knowing that AMC is looking to expand its footprint in the U.S.. Well-located Regal centers within EPR's portfolio seem like natural places for AMC to take over if Regal falls into distress.Topgolf is privately owned with around $400-500m of debt, but with latest private valuations at $2b. There was a lot of chatter earlier this year about a $4b IPO for Topgolf. As a business, management will be motivated to maintain its current locations and weather the coronavirus distress - closing down locations would have major implications to Topgolf's growth pitch if it ever returns to the IPO table.Together, these three tenants represent about 40% of EPR's revenue. Under the operating assumption that the three companies remain solvent and able to operate, they would have to continue to pay the contracted long-term triple-net lease rents. Think rent deferrals or maybe free rent could be possible and likely, but EPR has the cash and credit facility to bridge this if needed. Renegotiating 10+ year leases on the basis of a temporary shock is unreasonable from a market practice standpoint, though in times of extreme distress I'm sure people are willing to give into odd things. In my world, I potentially see a few months of lost rent, but ultimately think these tenants remain and continue to pay rents after the coronavirus is managed.On valuation, I'll just take broad strokes since no one really ever knows. Starting with YE2019 standing investments of $6.7b let's just say that $650m of the revenue is equivalent to NOI since most of these are triple-net leases. That gives an implied cap rate of ~10%. I do think these rent payments will be worth less from a multiple/cap rate viewpoint because the underlying credit of the tenants will change. As a proxy, the spread of BB (junk) to BBB (investment grade) corporate bonds has widened to ~600bps recently (more recently trending around 200-300bps). Let's say the new cap rate on the same cash flow should be 16% using this proxy. This implies a distressed valuation of ~$4b. The market is currently pricing ~$1b market cap on $3.1b debt with $500m cash, so enterprise value $3.6b. Feels like a good value right now even taking into account the downside.No numbers to really back this up, but I also think at $4b enterprise value, you have a wide range of real estate private equity and distressed investors that could consider a take-private transaction. I just have a hard time believing that this portfolio of properties would sell for under $4b given the above, and I think the private equity investors that have been hording dry powder are itching to put some money to work. Though getting shareholder approval with these depressed valuations I'm sure would be a big challenge.Just some lurkers 2 cents. Welcome thoughts!"
"Am I reading the closing correctly, up .56 today? About time!"
"Fox Business: AMC's reopened theaters sold out almost everywhere, CEO says.https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/amc-reopen-movie-theaters-sold-out-adam-aron"
are the dividends qualified or not.
"Time for EPR to announce a 5,000,000 share buy back."
Could the downward pricing pressure be related to harvesting losses for tax purposes?
AMC is EPR's biggest tenant and AMC up more than 90% today.shouldnt we expect a big move here?
"This looks like a good company, undervalued, good dividend, why all the complaints?"
As someone said; even if AMC goes down EPR still have properties at attractive locations. They could build apartments or stores there. But let’s hope AMC recover and that the virus dies.
Any reason for the drop or just cause?
"Another good earnings report! Love it. On a flight the other day, I sat next to a guy who went to a Top Golf and loved it, he was able to play with his group even though he was on crutches. That's an interesting spin on activities while recovering from injury! Now i wish i had bought more in the $55 range..."

I wonder when they will start paying dividends to ordinary shareholders...
AMC planning to open theaters where allowed in mid to late August.https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/07/regal-cinemas-amc-theatres-set-new-reopening-dates-for-movie-theaters.html
Temporary- even if AMC CHAPTER 11 - they will reorganize stronger- and as you know EPR MANAGEMENT is VERY SMART- they are only involved in STRONG sites- which will definitely be kept!
where we go from here ?!
"The annual shareholder's meeting will be Friday, May 29, 2020 at 11:00 a.m. (Central Time). The key question that I would like to see addressed in how much of a reduction in rents the company is experiencing and how long do they expect this to continue? Also, what type of agreements have they come to with the tenants for rent concessions while the renter's businesses are shut down?"
Does anyone have a good guess whether we might see a reduction in the dividend payable in May? The dividend payable on April 15 is .3825 per share. I'm thinking that the company may choose to reduce the dividend and either conserve cash or use the funds to repurchase shares.
New 52-week high at $72.18!
nice earnings report! The sky is not going to fall!
"Glad I took some off the table at $55 from $23 but folks, we are going to $75 plus within a year stay the course. This is almost a cash position for me I played the covid fear so well. Unless of course we have another big money liberal scam and have to muzzle up!! But hey hindsight is we know JPOW prints like a madman. Hold strong."
"Good news for EPR longs. Although some EPR traders are up 12% to 16% this month, September may be better as analysts started upping near term price targets now to over $40.00 per share over the weekend. This morning RBC raised EPR’s target price to $41. As a trader including several REITs I am long EPR under $30.00 currently covered with the 9/18/20 $40 Call at a $1.10 written early July. I sell calls for planned income and projected capital appreciation; now plan on adding more shares on dips, covering current open calls and repeat the cycle in a few weeks. Long and Happy Investing!"
"$EPR Cash Collections @ 72% in Q1-2021  (continued improvement), and $EPR had Cash Collectoins @ 77%  in APRIL 2021 (more continued improvement). Nice upward trend of increasing cash collections. And, here is the Big Catalyst —> 98%  of Theatre Properties will be OPEN by May 21, 2021 !!!!!!!!! ... ️ GREAT NEWS ️   Also, important to note: $EPR used cash of $90 Million to pay off their remaining balance on their $1 Billion Revolving Line of Credit. I see the REOPENING of nearly 100% of Theatre Properties as a MAJOR BULLISH CATALYST for $EPR. STRONG BUY on $EPR Key Excerpts from Q1-2021:First Quarter Company HeadlinesQuarterly Collections Continue to Increase - Cash collections from customers continue to improve and were approximately 72% and 77% of contractual cash revenue for the first quarter of 2021 and April 2021, respectively. In addition, year-to-date through April 30, 2021, the Company collected $40.0 million of deferred rent and interest from accrual basis tenants and borrowers that reduced receivables.Strong Increase in Theatre Reopenings Expected - Approximately 71% of the Company's theatre properties were open as of April 30, 2021. Additionally, with Regal's announced reopening schedule, it is expected that by May 21, 2021, approximately 98% of the Company's theatres will be open."

"Taking my losses and moving on. Loved EPR and enjoyed monthly dividends as a retiree. Hard to imagine EPR doing well in a pandemic environment. EPR business model does not work in a pandemic environment. Rate of infections continuing going up in states that have reopened faster than others. Should see the infections rates increase significantly in two weeks due to the civil unrest. Unemployment rate around 15% for those that are counted in the system. With CARES act unemployment bounce of $600 per week running out at the end of July it's hard to imagine unemployed folks with discretionary income in the near future. There will be many more companies filing for bankruptcy, increasing unemployment and the feds continuing to pass out digital currency. How much longer can the feds keep giving away money without consequences. Why is the fed giving away so much money? They have no other options. The rate of infections from Covid will continue to spread and a proven vaccine will not be available for 18 months at best...key word on vaccine is, proven! With lack of a coordinated national effort to address this pandemic we will hurt as a nation for many months to come. Forget football, baseball, conventions, tourism and expansion of the economy. I suggest we do what EPR management has done...Raise Cash and defer all unnecessary spending! As a Vietnam Veteran I hope the best for our country and look forward to celebrating our commonality as soon as it is safe to do so."
Nice to see good volume on the move higher!
UNBELIEVABLE- down 9 of the last 10 days after great report and dividend reinstatement- just shaking my head!
"By then the turn around will happen, back up to 80 and dividends along the way"
"The hits keep coming for this stock unfortunately. No one feels it more than those of us in around $65.Nothing to do but wait for the comeback. Not selling in my IRA, but this got brutalized from covid and the latest news today on more theaters closing. Since its temporary we should be ok. I do think next year when covid gets under control, folks will still want to go to the movies, go to Top Golfs, Zoos, concerts etc. I know I will. Until then we have to take the pain....and even consider averaging down for a better position long term. Hold the line guys!"
MANANGEMENT controls the dividend - and they decided to only give it to the special preferred customers and not to the commoner - that is what they have done wrong. They had plenty of cash to continue the dividend but decided we weren't worth it.
Motley suggests to sell = strong buy. AMC will drive this
Already above avg daily volume- that’s what we need to finally break above the 200 wma.
"I'm very bullish in the coming years, but do you think there is a chance to see this drop to low 20's or high teens again in the next month or so?"
Dividend now at 14.79%- at this pace we’ll be back to normal in no time. Where are all those dividend cut posters?
The quarter ended 3/31 reflected that they have paid down most all that they borrowed during the pandemic. Hopefully with the good news about recent theater ticket sales their revenues will be back at a level they are comfortable reinstating at least part of the dividend.
"Analysts: AMC, Cinemark, Netflix Won't Suffer Greatly From Warner Bros.' 2021 Streaming SchemeThe fears of cinema collapse are an ""overreaction,"" there is no ""death star,"" analysts say.https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/04/analysts-amc-cinemark-netflix-wont-suffer-greatly/Holdings (NYSE:CNK) dropped yesterday after AT&T's (NYSE:T) Warner Bros. division declared HBO Max will stream its entire lineup of 2021 films at no extra cost to HBO Max users. Shares of streaming content leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) also dipped yesterday as investors apparently expected HBO Max to challenge Netflix's premier position. Today, however, several Wall Street analysts have weighed in, saying the concerns are overblown.Eric Wold of B. Riley Financial says the share price plunge for the physical theater operators is ""likely to prove to be an overreaction"" by the stock market. Wold cites the release of COVID-19 vaccines as probably causing a return to the theaters in the near future. He also says marketing expenses will push Warner Bros. to ""abandon or meaningfully modify this new strategy"" and expects a much more moderate effect on cinema profits than ""initially feared."""
Why the severe drop?
Hey management- time to reinstate the dividend or time for you to be replaced!
WOW- amc completed over 1/2 billion dollar stock issuance- they are now in GREAT SHAPE- we should continue the move higher as our tenant has VASTLY IMPROVED!
EPR Properties Increases Monthly Dividend Nearly 6% for Common Shareholders to $.36 month or $4.12 annually. Makes this stock a 7.25% yielder.
tomorrow earnings should be interesting. Looks like good news is expected. Lets get this REIT back in form and paying us the div again.
"Interesting information from today's press release: ""... in response to the market dislocation of our stock price, our Board of Trustees has authorized a limited share repurchase program which we will selectively deploy while carefully considering our liquidity position."""
This stock will SKYROCKET the day AMC announces they are opening some theaters. AMC did the right thing today - furlough the EXECS - conserve cash. When TRUMP gives the okay to open parts of the country - we will see a MONSTER move in this stock.
OF COURSE!
Per my previous comment- they will not cut the dividend- and I’m sure they are buying selectively- this is a well run company!
$150 mil. Share repurchase. Depending on price - this could be over 10% of the outstanding shares- GREAT MOVE!
"missed earnings and dividend suspension, which didn't see that coming? rents are deferred so how did anyone expect the same dividend payouts. invest now on the dip and load up on this great company with solid leadership and financials. in a years time when business is back to normal you will enjoy a nice 20-30% return on your money, cant ask for a better situation.... providing you have the patience to wait a year."
"Why does EPR keep going down? I am dollar cost averaging on the way down. Somebody, anybody, why does this Reit yielding 6.4%, keep going down?"
"Today, I am writing you with the good news that coming soon, movies will be returning to the big screen at AMC theatres throughout the United States. We now expect that on Wednesday July 15, AMC will open approximately 450 theatre locations around the country (representing more than 90% of moviegoing at AMC). We will be showing new releases, as well as classic movies that are widely known and loved. And essentially all of our U.S. theatres should re-open by the end of July. This means that AMC will be there for you with open arms, welcoming you to enjoy Disney's inspiring MULAN and the Warner Brothers release of Christopher Nolan's intriguing TENET, along with several more superb movies now scheduled for a July theatrical release."
Dividend boost on its way 
"I understand the panic here but this won’t Bankrupt these companies they will prosper after a few. I’m adding like I said on the dips and if it falls to 15 I’m not worried, the dividend if cut will be temporary, this is a unique and great opportunity long term, but I understand the fears Which is creating this unbelievably low price do your own due diligence"
• Guidance to be provided with Q4 & YE 2019 earnings in late February• 2020 increase in monthly cash dividend to common shareholders alsoto be announced with Q4 & YE 2019 earnings

Good news for EPR shareholders; Stifel raises price target to $82 from $80.Another 6.5% appreciation from here plus a 6% divided meets my goals and objective.Long for the monthly divided and capital growth. Happy Investing
"Im pretty sure that in the long term EPR will hold out just fine, during the financial crisis in 2008 they cut their dividend by about 1/4, which might happen again, but even then it's still a ~20% yield which is insane for such a solid company. The analysts estimates are around $60 in a 2 year period which if true will make this an insane investment opportunity to gain ~300% in capital gains and a huge YOC on top of that."

"Very insightful article written by Matthew Frankel. His DD research is bullish on $EPR’s portfolio of A-Rated Movie Theaters. https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/01/will-movie-theaters-survive-or-even-thrive-in-2022/Key Excerpts:<< Deidre Woollard: So what do you think about the future of movie theaters, in general? Do you think EPR (NYSE:EPR) is going to gradually, I believe at the start of the pandemic, it was talking about the fact that having AMC as the biggest tenant might be an issue, is that something that they're looking at gradually adding more things and then diluting how important AMC is to the overall REIT? >><< Matt Frankel: They haven't specifically said it, but when they talk about getting into big growth mode again, I don't get the vibe they're going to buy more movie theaters. I think the concentration is going to go down naturally. If they spend $1 billion on water parks and ski resorts and casinos and things like that, it will naturally will reduce the concentration in movie theaters. I see that happening over time. If Simon owns the A-malls, EPR owns the A-movie theaters. There are about 40,000 movie theaters in the U.S. and most experts agree we need about 30,000; the industry can support about 30,000. The 10,000 that are going to close are not the ones in EPR's portfolio, those are the ones that are underperforming, the ones that are half-full even when there's a new movie out, things like that. EPR, I don't think they're going to expand that side of their portfolio. I think the movie theater business will be just fine, people want to go to the theaters. Even Disney (NYSE:DIS) said the future for their Pixar movies is not to put it on Disney+ at the same time, it's to put it right to the theaters, I think Warner made a similar announcement that beyond 2021, things are going to go right to the theaters and not on HBO Max. For the rest of 2021, box office revenues are going to get some subsistence level. Man, I can talk today. It's time to get off Live. Too many meetings today, I'm talked out. But the level is going to be really low for the rest of 2021. In 2022, when everyone stops putting things on streaming services at the same time as the theater releases, you're going to see the movie theater business really pop back. Movie theaters have co-existed with streaming for a long time now, it's not that streaming is going to cause the demise of the movie theater overnight. I mentioned that ticket sales peaked in 2002, they haven't declined by a ton, and per seat revenue has increased so much because the younger generations want things like the fancy seats, they want better dining options in theaters, they want theaters that have full bars and then not just like an 80-ounce Coca-Cola for $20 or whatever you used to buy. They want more of these fancier options and it's increased revenue to the point where it's even overtaken the decline in ticket sales that resulted from streaming. I think the movie theater business and streaming can really co-exist well. How long has Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) been streaming for? Did it kill the movie theater business? No. Now, even the streaming services that have great movie studios like Disney are saying that they are going to be a theater first model. I think there's a reason they are doing that, it's because that's where they can generate the most revenue. If they didn't think people are going to go to the theaters, they wouldn't be doing that. If Disney thought that they could make more money by releasing things on Disney+ for $30, that's exactly what they would do. Disney is a business, they want to make money. I think movie theaters, in general, will be just fine. If you own any other REITs that have a big movie theater concentration like Realty Income (NYSE:O) or Store Capital (NYSE:STOR) or any of those, I think you don't have anything really to worry about. >>"
Ok- I’m shocked- didn’t expect suspension of dividend- how will this be viewed by the market?
Looks like this will be the 10th week fighting for breakout above the 50 week ma.
I bought today... with a big smile on my face
All management has to do is announce the dividend is back and we will move back to where we belong!
ALL: The dividend will NOT be cut - that doesn't occur in situations like this - temporary shock. The dividend was actually just raised. If you ever wanted to get into this stock - your chance is NOW - this will be a GREAT investment - mark my words - buy and look at the investment this fall - you will be VERY HAPPY.
"Ouch... Regal Cinemas latest causality of Covid. How much longer can AMC holdout? EPR's portfolio doesn't work in pandemic environment. Perhaps management has to look at opportunities other than experiential properties. As a former holder of EPR months ago I had to reallocate my investment dollars. Hopefully, management is too."
"So the big deal of the day is the CLA bankruptcy, and what and when we'll get anything back out of it, including re-leasing the subject locations.........also going down generally because of the rising interest rate environment. Also, if there is another general economic downturn, how will the entertainment industry (a discretionary expenditure) fare. Still mighty tasty dividend, but there is a reason."
just joined the family and bought up shares at this price i got a great monthly div and i put it on drip lets go!!!
EPR hits new 52-week high at 52.15!
Hoping this resumes paying a dividend soon.
"Very positive business update. If this continues, perhaps a bump up in dividends in the 1st quarter of 2022."
so im thinking about buying this. How material is the risk of an AMC bankruptcy and how would it affect share prices?
Nothing management can do here. Just a terrible portfolio to have during a lasting pandemic. EPR has good management but the business model doesn't work with Covid.
When will EPR pay monthly or quarterly dividends again?
"I am surprised they have not announced a settlement with AMC for back rent owed. With that, I would think they could become compliant with the covenants that were temporarily waived under the credit facilities...and then re-commence the payment of dividends. AMC clearly has the cash now to enter into a settlement. Any thoughts on this?"
MaNaGeMeNt working hard today raising the share price! LOL
"Well, I guess it was to be expected... and maybe it will get back down into the low teens? At that point I will add a little more and work towards doubling my position (not a lot). We need to keep an eye on when the Theaters open up again- that will be a good turning point.""...the Company has also determined that it will temporarily suspend its monthly cash dividend to common shareholders after the common share dividend payable May 15, 2020 (except as may be necessary to maintain REIT status and to not owe income tax) and will suspend the share repurchase program upon the effective date of the covenant modification agreements, which is expected to occur in the next 30 days."""
this is a great value play
"Buy on the dips! It’s a disaster at the moment but think above 6 months when things reopen and start to get back to normal . People will be flocking to recreational entertainment forums after being stuck in the house, these companies have At the least enough cash in hand to cover a quarter of rental payments"
"From previous company liquidity release- with NO DIVIDEND, NO BUY BACK and ZERO RENT COLLECTED they can now go more than 43 months- WOW!"
I thought the earnings call was very positive. I added today. I didn't expect it to fall under 51 after that call.
"Undervalued,it’s a buy!"
Excellent news announcement: rent will be deferred- meaning they will collect it later. Liquidity is great - even if they collect NO RENT but still do the share repurchase and assume they get zero rent - the dividend could be maintained for 19 months. We all know things will get better as the country begins opening- so as I’ve said—> DIVIDEND IS SAFE!
"What a great report, increasing ffo is always a good thing! GLTA longs."
"New investor here.Everybody says this is a turn around and reopening play. But hasn't this already more than doubled form the low of year of $21?From today's price of $48, how much upside is left?I am willing to buy and hold for a couple of years. What could be the potential price target if every property they own reopens?Thank you in advance!"
Would this be a good dividend stock to jump into with 20k?
Going for an eight day in a row down-SICKENING!
"Thanks for the dividend, I will be buying more shares in your company with the money."
"I can’t see this going straight up, low volume still. I think this is just following news of stock buyback and bill being passed. I think once unemployment numbers come out and such she dips again before stabilizing for a slow crawl back up to $60+"
". Unfortunately the virus and this communist character Sanders got the market spooked real bad.Keep in mind EPR is a LANDLORD. Good bad or ugly, its tenants will pay rent. By the way, even if the GOVt ordered a shut down of movies, golf etc- all of the companies have business interruption insurance. Don’t work, EPR will be just fine.Buy more."
Have had a position in it for many years and found it to be a dependable dividend payer and a well-run company.
Dudes: Hollywood will not permit the movie theatres to become obsolete. Watching 1st run movies on the big screen will continue to be cheap enjoyable entertainment. We are human beings and we need fun things to do. Covid 19 will eventually pass over.
They will put dividend back starting June 2021
Thanks for the great dividend
Bought 330 shares hoping the risk paid off
used to pay .33 divi EVERY MONTH. it will again!!
Nice to see $30s again - on the way back to $80
OK - now the yield is > 7.4% --> MY GOD - this is either a GREAT time to get in - or there is something wrong with the business. I would think if there was something wrong - they would not have grown the dividend like they just did. I'm going to add to my holdings tomorrow and pray I chose the right one.
5.6% DIVIDEND YIELD  —> $EPR trading at $53.55 per share —> $EPR now pays a Monthly Dividend on Common Stock of $0.25 per Month 
NICE- as I’ve said - NO DIVIDEND CUT+ SHARE BUYBACK+ country opening back up——> price moves up.
any thoughts on this stock now?
Is AMC going to pay back all the back rent?
"Does anyone seriously believe this lock down situation will go on for 6 months or a year? New treatmentS for CV19 are coming on line and people need to get back to work. The public will not stand for it and the science is starting to say stay at homes are not needed everywhere and maybe they don’t even work. Also a vaccine is being fast tracked for THIS January. The time to buy this stock is when everyone is afraid of it. If as an investor, you have a time horizon of over 6 months, this is a screaming buy. EPR has Liquidity to pay its bills AND to buy back oversold shares. The earnings call is almost irrelevant, the only real question is will America reopen within the next few months, I added more today to an already substantial position. I can wait 6 moths to 2 years for a great ROI. Do your own DD. Never bet against America..."
"Dinner and a movie are not going away. People want to go out, enjoy and live their lives. This stock will return to pre Covid levels in time. If you are an investor this is a worth while addition to any portfolio. Buy it now check back in a year you’ll be pleased you did."
Anyone know whats going on??
$EPR is up over 40% —> This is a strong market validation of the Entertainment Industry. People want to go out to the movies again! The new vaccine will be a big boost to business in general. Looking forward to the reinstatement of the dividend in 2021!
Every EXPERIENCIALREIT I have is up BIG today- except this DOG. They will be moving into gaming- take a look at MGP & GLPI today- it’s NOT Coronavirus!
when dividend gets reinstated it's about a 17% yield at it's current price 
Had to...no choice but to lock in a 6% return today. Will settle for a 6% return now and capital gains in the future. The gift that keeps on giving!
"Need some more love/traction for EPR and for Delta variant to subside! . Note the top 3 holders are 1)Blackrock, 2)Vanguard, 3)Investco. We are in good company!!!! The monthly dividend reinstated should help wake some investors up, I would think."
This stock is no worse than O and O just had a dividend increase. I feel O should have more of a downturn.
"Down 7% in three days on 2X normal volume each day wiping out a whole year of dividends.Maybe it will bounce tomorrow? Like sign in restaurant ""Free Beer Tomorrow"""
"Seems like a good company, but they are gonna take a big hit for so many places being shut down for so long. I'll wait to buy this when it's much lower."
They are still paying dividend in this awful environment. Good sign.
Anyone know what they said in the call to cause the price drop?
Cuomo just said open the theatres up now. It was all political.
what is happening.... recent seling in light of good news from AMC
"What a great UP day- especially if you started your position back in April.I should have bought when it was in the low teens to average down from the 50's... I didn't. But sold out today to get some money on the sidelines and take the loss. GLTA- I'll be back though- I think this REIT is a good one. I may look at the preferred shares, they still pay a dividend."
"No surprise this one blew up along with VTR Ventas. Now the name of the game is to buy when everyone else is running for the door.....but when? I jumped in to soon at 67 on EPR but will buy more when the current nightmare situation settles down. I still want it for my Roth iRA but dont want to catch the falling knife. My dry powder is staying dry for now. Maybe ""O"" is a better choice for my Roth REIT buy? Brutal times for us all. I will hold the line!"
Ohhhh- it broke above the 200DMA today! That’s a great sign!
BULLISH —> Theatres are coming back strong! ... People have been shut-in way too long! ... EVERYBODY wants to get out and go see a movie! —>   ... MUST READ —> Theatre Box Office — (From the $EPR Q1-2021 Transcript) .... Analysts think Box Office Gross Receipts will increase from $450 Million right now —> ️ UP TO $4 Billion to $5 Billion by Year End 2021 ️ ..... PS: IGNORE all the naysaying... The dividend will be reinstated by Year End 2021 as the Entire Economy Reopens! ... GO $EPR   
I want my divy back …now
movie theaters open for less than 1 month in Washington State and the governor close them today for another month.
Once people realize a vaccine isn’t coming out anytime soon the market is going to drop again Don’t get all caught up in it
I have never invested in stocks. I am a senior in high school looking to make some extra income. Is this a good stock to start with?
What's happening?
Seeking Alpha markets over priced stuff..this REIT is double a buy price...IMO
"All reits are down today. Also, people are taking some profits before earnings, and EPR is dealing with a lot of insider trading by investors."
"The stock price has been doing pretty well considering the dividend suspension. I think there is optimism about a vaccine being available soon. Unfortunately, I think it's going to be many months until movie theaters and entertainment venues can reopen. I expect that EPR is going to have to give significant concessions to renters who are not getting any revenue."
"It has been a long 15 month wait, but finally collecting the dividend and reinvesting it and buying more on Monday as well."
I am not a troll. i am long epr. Will epr definitely survive? i am a retiree living off dividend income.
AMC going bankrupt!! EPR leases almost 60% of its properties to AMC! No revenue for foreseeable future???

Will people return to the theatres in time to save us?
"Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson predicted the Soviet Union would overtake the U.S. economy by 1984. Less than a decade later, on Christmas Day 1991, the Soviet Union was wiped off the map.Karel van Wolferen’s The Enigma of Japanese Power: People and Politics in a Stateless Nation, published in 1989, marked the peak of the Japanese mania. Almost to the day, Japan entered a 30-year period of stagnation from which it has yet to emerge.In 2001, Goldman Sachs’ Jim O’Neill anointed “BRIC” – Brazil, Russia, India and China – as the economic superpowers. In 1994, just three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.K.’s Hamish McRae predicted, “It is very difficult to see China as anything other than the world’s largest economy in 2010.”But today, a decade later, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $21.44 trillion remains 50% above China’s (questionable) $14.14 trillion. And the late Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Fogel’s prediction in 2010 that the Chinese economy will reach $123 trillion by 2040 is not aging well.You put yourself above the daily fray of financial market headlines.My advice as Buffett advises, if you believe in American Ingenuity then “Never bet against America.”"
"Perhaps this will come to epr as it has in GameStop and now amc- A short squeeze is also likely contributing to the steep rise in AMC's share price. Many individual traders have been coordinating their stock purchases on sites like Reddit in an attempt to pressure short sellers. To exit their positions, short-sellers must buy back the shares they sold short -- a dynamic that can drive the price of a heavily shorted stock, such as AMC Entertainment, even higher."
May the stock market Rest In Peace.
"EPR is parting roughly a 17% dividend. I dont care what anyone here says, but mgt can’t do a deal that nets it 17%. So mgt should take that 450,000,0000 cash and just buy back shares. T"
CEO (Silvers) sold a ton of shares a couple of days ago.... A bad sign for stockholders???
"Bank of America, upgrade EPR to a buy. Sixty Two dollar target. Maybe close over 50 today?"
Bought 50 additional shares
If amc defaults they need to keep as much cash as possible on the balance sheet to make it thru the recession due to covd-19. That is why they aren’t buying stock and why the stock is dropping.
"EPR Properties announced that the Company will release its third quarter 2020 financial results after the market close on Wednesday, November 4, 2020 at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST. Management will host a conference call to discuss the Company's financial results on Thursday, November 5, 2020 at 8:30 a.m. EST."
This stock dropped 36 percent today. That’s almost $16. Do you know how many monthly dividends you need to get $16? Trust me its a lot.
"Investors fear that EPR must be very vulnerable to recessions since it relies on consumer discretionary spending. The logic is that as we go into a recession, people will spend less on AMC (AMC) movie theater tickets and more on Netflix (NFLX). The coronavirus outbreak makes this even worse. In reality, it's the opposite: EPR is among the safer REITs because it earns steady rent checks from triple net leases:Triple net leases are very long in nature, 13 years in this case, and rents are pre-set for the entire duration. Moreover, all property expenses are the responsibility of the tenant which protects EPR against inflation. The leases also include automatic rent increases of 1.5-2% per year. Finally, the tenants enjoy strong rent coverage, nearly 2x, and so even if they temporarily suffer in a recession, they are unlikely to default on their leases.Therefore, even if we go into a recession tomorrow, it would not have a great impact EPR’s cash flow which is highly predictable and consistent.The defensive cash flow makes EPR an ideal retirement investment because it allows to fund generous dividend payments. Right now, EPR pays a 15% dividend yield that is safely covered at an 82% payout ratio. Historically, it has managed to grow this dividend at a 6% annual growth rate: mEven better, the dividend is paid on a monthly basis, which makes it ideal for retirees who live off the income. Right now is a good time to invest as EPR is trading at a discounted valuation relative to its own historical average. At just 6x FFO, it offers good margin of safety and appreciation potential:Bottom Line: EPR is an ideal retirement investment because it generates steady and predictable cash flow. It's historically discounted. And it pays a generous 15% dividend yield that's set for further growth. The income is paid on a monthly basis and expected to remain sustainable in the coming recession."
"During pandemic lenders altered loan covenants instead of calling loans......one of those new loan covenants prohibited using available cash to pay common stock dividends. EPR report indicates improvement in results but covenants remain in place for now. Stock will trade higher on continued improvement which anticipates renegotiation of covenants resulting in eventual reinstatement of dividends. Dividends are coming back, but probably will be late 2021."
HELLO AGAIN 200 WMA AT 52.23- IS THIS FINALLY THE TIME WE BREAK THROUGH?
"Certainly EPR is out of favor and a great value at 68 given the uncertainty of their pending deal within the gaming space. I’m confident management will prudently redeploy capital and continue dividend payments for years to come, making EPR a strong buy under $70."
IS THIS TRUE( don’t see news ):Projected dividend changes (NYSE:EPR) to $0.265 from $0.3825.
"Perhaps this a reaction to the fear of the coronavirus. Many corporate cancellations of meetings and gatherings. EPR properties is a place where people gather. Airlines, cruise ships and hotels experiencing significant cancellations. I've been adding looking to boost my income. At these yields of 7% - 10% found in oil companies, REIT's hard not to lock in at these prices. GLTA!"
"This is pricing a bankruptcy at 50/50; seems extreme with the liquidity on the BSSeems AMC is the biggest risk, and its actually up a bit today; I would think you will see some lease modifications and a dividend adjustment, but, at least they own real assets (buildings) I don't know, who does, but, sitting on an enormous loss, its not worth selling whats left vs possible non bankruptcy Be nice to hear from mgmt at some point - the silence is hurting"
I have 63 stocks. I buy a week ago when was $41. Should I keep it for long term? Keep dropping every day
My prediction: we now have a share repurchase going on- ideally for a great use of cash they buy low and sell high- so I say they won’t touch the dividend until summer to see if tenants get to open - and in the mean time they buy stock at these DEPRESSED levels. They will know by by then if they can leave the dividend alone. BTW- now a days when these companies cut dividend the stock moves up- another reason for them not to while they’re buying.
Keep up the fine job management- you really go the extra mile for investors.
"The AMC stock issue this week makes it more likely EPR will collect back rent from this tenant, if any negotiations still ongoing. AMC was also treated as cash basis accounting which would super boost earnings."
AMC just announced reopening of 450 theaters around the US ! July 15th! Epr will be back in the zone now !
Lost $1200 in this stock but not to worry I received $360 in dividends over a year of holding
Anyone complaining not seeing dividends now should realize dividends and high price will come at the same time!
One of these days we’ll get rewarded in a big way!
IMO EPR is over priced at $41. Long term buyers might want to nibble around the $32 area. Important to keep in mind that there will not be dividends paid through 2021 in accordance with an agreement with lenders that is in place.
Be patient look at it as a buying opportunity till everything opens back up without any fear involved
So the stock has reached bottom Lucky buyers today
"The transparency in the PR is good overall, but clear the company will need to be cutting dividends and soon. With all the talk of 12-18 months for a vaccine, it is possible with the customer profile that revenues will fall big time. But the good news is that if they do that, the chance of financial distress is remote. I would be buying more in the event of a sell-off on a dividend cut, as eventually the country (and company) will overcome this period."
Why up today?
Easy $60+ coming steadily. Good hold in this volatile market.
AMC today said they have substantial doubt they can remain in business yet EPR is up 7% today
"I held EPR through the pandemic because I knew the dividend would be back! Believe it or not, I own a gold stock with a monthly dividend. Check out FTCO. Ex-dividend is 7/16/21."
WOW- GREAT UPDATE AND WE ARE FINALLY THROUGH THE 200 WMA!
Disney expects to release Mulan into theaters in late July. Get the May dividend and maybe only miss 2 or 3 months dividends. AMC on the hook for past due rent. Disney stock holding up well. All depends on this d**n virus.
"EPR can't even get off the mat today. BV is $38, so maybe that would be the eventual floor on this one. If management can swallow some pride, cancel the gaming purchase (the agreement was ""non-binding"" per the last CC) and use the cash to 1) buy back stock 2) support the dividend and 3) buy another property in the $200M-$500M range in the coming months while everything is on a fire sale, I'd bet EPR would get back into the $60's real quick."
mass gatherings not set to return until mid 2021. Can EPR survive this long with little income?
"Great news on the dividend reinstatement. I think this will run as soon as folks get the word. I will admit, I just found out, and believe me I have been waiting!!!! Bring on the monthly divs. Good luck going forward to my fellow longs!!!!"
"June 1st, 2021 —> EPR Properties : Raymond James raises to STRONG BUY from market perform! ... HUGE UPSIDE in $EPR    —> EVERYBODY go see a movie this upcoming weekend !!!    "
Does this stock still pay a dividend? I read their dividend yield is 7%.
That nice little jump in volume and price about an hour before close peaked my interest. I hope some good news may be forthcoming.
GAME ON - we’ve taken the 50 dma - now onward to the 200 WMA!
Why are we popping today?
"Epr announced another dividend for preferred stockholders, this is the third. How much longer do common stockholders have to wait?"
At least they restored the dividend. Thought it might go up after respectful earning report
"Bought Monday at 27$ yesterday at 19 $ today at 14$ and it just Keeps dropping. I’m thinking that’s a over reaction from 70$ just a few weeks ago, let’s hope recreation activities are back to normal after a few months and amc for one doesn’t go bankrupt"
Very good earnings- nice increase in 2018 estimates.
EPR has announced that the May dividend is .3825. I'm a little bit surprised that they did not decrease the dividend but I see it as a good sign that they expect the tenants will be able to continue paying.
"I'm no financial analyst. My thought is before EPR lease holders skip lease payments they would use their cash or line of credits to make these payments. Could any of these lease holders have pandemic insurance? Is there such an insurance to pay in the case of a catastrophic event? The other option is nuclear, file bankruptcy which is to be avoided at all cost. Am I missing something here? I would think the dividend is safe as, this too shall pass. Any thoughts?"
Nice to see the bump up of earnings estimates. Analysts must be seeing some improvements.
What a great few days. It will be $40 after earnings. Keep waiting for the single digits LOL.
"Great quarter, great outlook and brought back dividend- stock down ever since- unbelievable!!!"
"Dividend paid and next one announced today, great company."
Wow! Up 30% premarket!
Almost 8% yield - WOW - > this will move much higher now that the worry about AMC is over.
To me EPR seems like it is ready for a big jump in the next couple month. Pretty sweet dividend for those who bought the dip too. Thoughts?
"BREAKOUTCONFIRMED breakout above 50.75, no resistance in area just above.Type: True breakout from triple+ resistance.Target: 58.93, 11.6% Stop: 49.71 Loss: 5.8% P/L ratio: 2 : 1 - FairBREAKDOWNNone."
"RBC raises $EPR Price Target from $41.00 to $49.00 per share. As the economy continues to “reopen” and 98% of the Theatre Properties “open” on May 21, 2021, the $EPR Price Target will likely continue to get bumped up. I think we’ll see $75.00 to $80.00 in the next 1 to 2 years or sooner. Do your own due diligence research before buying or selling anything. Just my honest opinion —> INVEST & HOLD $EPR "
Could today be the day EPR declares the reinstatement of the dividend?
