I wanted them to but $bmrn
"BMRN is a possible buy out target (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4451821-biomarin-more-opportunities-ahead). But not by the companies mentioned in that link. However, the little green men on Mars wouldn't mind an extra eye in the middle of their forehead. The only issue is BMRN can't guarantee where the third eye may form. Think about all of the possibilities of where the third eye can appear. Now imagine all of the ramifications of having a third eye in various different locations both inside and outside of a body. Interesting possibilities that are too numerous to count. Yep i say go ""Gung HO"" and sell this stuff to extraterrestrials.Getting back to that possible buy out. Martians are the marketeers of our universe. They can sell a dead person a house on a ocean beach in death Valley. Once they find out of the possibilities of a third eye, they will go crazy with the cheese whiz with all the market opportunities and potential return on investment."
you all are so optimistic over possible fraud with bmrn... you say hey no biggie brmn has lots of cash ad many other promising products in pipeline.... but....but...but... what it those other promising products cause a third eye in forehead or the pipeline gets backed up and can't be unplugged? Say good-bye to investment...
"Biomarin has 5-6 early stage promising candidates in their pipeline, and collaboration with Allen Institute and AI partners. And with dwarfism and hemophilia drugs to be approved in 2021-2022, that adds more revenue and cash pile as sales start rolling in. And guess what they will fund? Those 5+ candidates in the pipeline to really grow. The stock is reflective of the pace of innovation. And the best part about Biomarin is that they don't need dilutive funding to advance their pipeline, so that means shareholders do not get diluted either. Just have to wait for the these drugs to really pan out. In the meantime, enjoy the dwarfism and hemophilia revenues to come. 2 year data is maturing for valrox, and there is clear benefit. I still don't think the FDA should have requested the 2 year data for approval. Should have been conditional approval."
"Revised revenue up for the year, and profitability next year? Plus approval likely in November. I'll pick up a few shares to see if this can rocket back up."
"(RVPH) Market Cap $57 m--Cash $38 million --A Phase 3 biotech with MONSTER Pipeline targeting multiple blockbuster indications like Alzheimer ,Parkinson ,Depression ,ADHD and so forth / under radar low float stock = CHEAPEST Biotech out there with potential to run like SAVA which went from $3 to $130+ ...GLTA####"
"Should be down today, at least 10%."
BioMarin Pharmaceutical is up 5.20% to 75.45
Nice day for BMRN... glad bought a little more. GLTA
No adverse news. Why tanking today?
"As a rule, an FDA rejection has this effect.What's in the pipeline?That's for another day. For today, preservation of capital should be number one goal.nt"
"""RBC Capitol price tgt $88.00, CFRA has it as,""strong buy""."
Hold everyone.
Sold 10 puts and bought 250 shares because of possible FDA approval on 11/20 of Voxzogo.
"Mark my words. BMRN will be over $98 by end of the year but i anticipate much sooner. 2 huge billion dollar drugs are near fruition. Gene therapy sunk the stock and will soon make it rise with the data release which looks pretty good so far. A monster multi billion dollar Hem A market. There are 19000 eligible patients, and if even half the patients were treated at least a million dollar treatment, well, do the math. Also Vosorotide is on the way as well which will be a billion $ plus as well. Just the gene therapy manufacturing alone with be a huge asset, if, and yes its still an if, it all works out. But BMRN gets drugs approved! They're aren't little some start up with no products, no experience with the FDA or getting products approved. I'm on big on this stock and am anticipating near their 52 high this year"
Going to buy some more shares tomorrow. Looks like this can run to $80's next month with runup to FDA approval of VOGO.
"Merrill says this was a LT project, and changes nothing for BMRN. The future pipeline is robust. PT $110"
fair value >$100 easily. EASILYAnd it's struggling to stay above $75This is ridiculous
"It has already hit the bottom $75, the people who are saying it will go down to $50 should quit trading and start doing some other things. People are forgetting that this company sell many other medicines. One blow would not bring the company down. And also overall market is down today due to other negatives news."
"Next is US approval for drawfism. And then the big one with valrox next year. Plus they early pipeline is looking great. Biomarin also knows how to commercialize, mass produce, and already a sales channel to hit the floor running. Biomarin is going to grow in the next 12 months, and can hit $120."
