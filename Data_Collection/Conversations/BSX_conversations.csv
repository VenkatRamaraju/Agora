BSX target price increased to $40 from $32 at JPM........
I don't think that BSX has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
C’mon stock! Move already…
"Karen Firestone of Aureus Assets Management, #25 of Forbes Wealth Managers List, recommended Boston Scientific (BSX) as a top pick for 2021 on CNBC’s Halftime Report on 12/31/20. She views it as a Covid vaccine rebound play that has not yet caught up to an eventual post Covid reality. In 2020, she said, patients have delayed “elective” surgeries which will create a pent up demand for their cardiology devices."
Bsx partnership with Nvcn or a buyout??
"Just bought some BSX. Good stock. Hope it will up end of year, then to next year."

"Up after hours,Does anyone know why."
This stock has done nothing in one month. It?s like a cat stuck in a tree indefinitely. What a #$%$ stock.
"How will Abt’s fda approval on Amulet, left atrial appendage closure device effect bsx’s Watchman business? Who has higher market share in ous (Europe) where both have been selling for awhile? Are there any inherent advantages one device gas over the other? Watchman has enjoyed no competition to date in US market, does the market expand or will competitive device take share from Watchman?"
At least they are consistent with the earnings misses. Glad I sold at 37 yesterday - now I wonder what's the right re-entry point. Good thing is we are close to the floor at 34-35.
Time to move on with a new management team. Almost 3 years with no SP growth.
$40 by the end of the year for sure. Mark my post.
I looked for a year to buy on today's price. One of the best companies in the market.
I hear 60 minutes is good show
"the broader market brought this down further today. however, revenue decline is a REAL concern here and will continue to be during COVID. being hyper-focused on efficiency is great, but the current market doesn't respect that nor care how many companies you acquired if they aren't bringing in revenue. Boston need to show real growth or tout the potential for growth to succeed in this difficult market. not to hate on this stock in particular, same is true for 90% of stocks out there. in 2 years, maybe Boston's acquisitions will pay off. CEO is strong. right now, what is their answer to corona though? when Medtronic got in on ventilators or 3M upped their game in PPE, Boston just furloughed employees to save cash. okay, not the worst option but what happens next? convince me why I should touch any value stock right now when their are corona-proof growth stocks like ZOOM or Enphase? I revisit all med device companies once we have vaccines. until then, none of them are ""safe"" or winners until the market starts respecting value. also, a blue wave only hurts any med device company. in 2021, especially under full dem control, there will be very few stocks that win. don't make the mistake of listening to your financial advisor who pushes value stocks that will continue to lose until we see signs that these are starting to win."
No big deal. Read that EPS will only be affected 1 to 2 cents in 2021. Great buy here! I just picked some up on the dip. Good luck all!
Held 20 years TWENTY YEARS...when boy!
Alright... Decided to jjjuurrrmpppp on in just below $25.
