"What's going to happen when these leases are up? Everyone is working from home fine. Leases won't be renewed and prices drop. Same with high end living. Why be near city and pay twice re rent, traffic, smog. Move to lowere price rental. Your computer will work their just as well."

People don’t want to go back to the office. Plus the dividend is suspended. Sell this trash
"2/22/2018The overall market has come back nicely the past 2 weeks, with a nice move midday today. The large liquid names that we love like JPM, TCF, FULT and UVSP and all moved up nicely. The last 3 we own for takeout plays only and dividends or we would be out, JPM we still think is cheap and own 50% of our position still.ORIT and CIZN our dividend pays 7% and 4.5% they haven’t done much in price movement, but let us sleep with the cash payouts. We keep adding RCBC, also a takeout play at $275 we think!OPY is now again 55% of all monies, we loaded up again last week.We are buying “short-term” S and P puts again today as a hedge for heavy long accounts. OPY again benefits greatly if short-term rates go sharply up, which already have, again this year. Blowout earnings will continue here, till they get bought.Half of all banks deals were under $200 million in size the past few years, that should mean MCPH and FRFC could be next. Most deals seem to be happenings in the mid-west, were growth is hard to find.We have “shorted PYPL” again, today, as a hedge only, a 5% position to start.The fed could raise rates 3 to 6 times the next 12 months, I would bet 6.Many banks have no growth, stay with the ones with great deposits, this has always worked well for us with smart people running the shop.We just use common sense and reasonable expectations approach while watching the downside risk, this is most important in todays world. Banks are always a risky place to invest as they can make the short-term look better than it really is, we stay with the honorable bankers.Insiders must also own a lot of stock and always buy it and never sell any shares, like OPY has done.We beat heavy when odds are in our favor and the CEO does the same thing!In fact, OPY bought back shares last year a ton 450,000 at almost 50% of tangible book value, about the best use of shareholder capital I have ever seen. It is the only liquid stock still to buy in our sector that I can find still today. Yes, even up 70% this year it is still cheap, I don’t think I could say that about any other liquid stock, while it may have 10% downside risk it we get a hard sell-off our Puts and “shorts” would easily cover that. In fact, if rates raise a lot causing a downturn OPY should again go up. Our average account that was long only was up 88% last year and all hedged and margin accounts were up 107% plus in 2017. Hedged accounts in 2018 are already up 35% do to the recent meltdown and hedges we had on.These results will only be repeated if OPY gets taken out. Most of these gains again for 2017 were by betting heavy on OPY the past few years, longs like SCZC, CHMG, AVBH, CFFI, MCPH, RCBC, and JPM.Most of 2018 gains have so far been from trading “shorts” and S and P short-term,” Puts” timed, very well. These results again, will most likely, not be repeated any time soon. In fact, most of the real bargains are gone now, but with earnings power now the driver on names like OPY , not just out of favor bargains way under book value, OPY should do very well in 2018 and 2019. If the market did crash “shorts” like PYPL and S and P “Puts” should again cover any OPY losses if they were to occur and 20% to 30% in cash, also helps us grab more OPY at $22 to $23 if the market drops 20% or more, which we feel is a 50% chance now, just Put options are again not cheap, like they were, last month. Either way we will do well and keep picking off names like TCF and FULT on big sell off days if they happen again and selling names like CHMG and CFFI when they got fully priced last year.We are just going to keep at it, ignore all the “Noise” !

"I was in this until they started dumping suburban NJ office properties to double down on Jersey City. People are moving out of NYC and into the suburbs. I can see big companies downsizing expensive office space in the city, but opening smaller offices in North Jersey and LI/Westchester to accommodate commuters."
