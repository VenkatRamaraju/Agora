ASR announcement today is very bullish for Cigna .
Most recent post 8 days old—-? Have to fix that. TJ how’s the weather been treating you? Unusually cold at night here recently
Please exercise great caution with Cigna as it has dropped under the range it’s traded in for over a month . Operationally it’s going great but the stock is not following suit .
Best buy of the week on AAPL CI APLS NVAX indeed....GL
"Here we go again, up to high to 169 and change coming, I'll feel slightly optimistic then it will return to 165"
I prefer to track the JMG indicator. I have found it to be reliable.
Earning per share of 2.87 shows CI ability to generate Free Cash Flow in good time or bad time.
"Haha ... Kevin Fischbeck of BofA sneezes and the market reacts. What sheep. Fischbeck ""reversed"" his position from ""buy"" to ""underperform"" ... merely based on Cigna's ""lack of clarity"" on earnings projections. But more amazing is that he simply moved his price evaluation from $240 to $225 .... And that warrants a double downgrade? ... when the stock is currently at 205 to 210? What a hack."
could this be the day to start a position? crazy valuation on this drop compared to the market
Not gonna lie ... I love Cigna ( it?s my family?s insurer ) and the Company deserves a better price than it?s got . But I?m throwing in the towel here for a little while and jumping on the UNH train . Not a huge fan of UNH but it#$%$ new highs and looks to go higher still . Soon .
"Cigna is undervalued no doubt about that. Just now they declared a quarterly dividend of USD 1 per share. If the market didn’t react positively and correctly price the information, then the Efficient Market Hypothesis of professor Fama is flawed. I tried to load more on the dip yesterday but, unfortunately, I ran out of cash."
Earnings due out on 2/6 will blow the top off this thing.IMO $220 is not out of the question
Straight up comparison with peers UNH and HUM - Cigna is significantly undervalued in relation to both .
rang the register at 202.7.... can't stand the election news anymore... may come back in if drops further or if market corrects.
CI may finally run bigly on earnings this week!
Yay! Nice Xmas present trade. $4-$5 share on 1500 shares. Ho Ho Ho.
"IMO, nearing the bottom of the recent trading range"
"CI getting crushed. Any news? Never mind. Here it is. BofA Securities Double-Downgrades Cigna to Underperform From Buy, Lowers PT to $225 From $240, Shares Lower Premarket"
"CEO David Cordani at the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference on September 14…“…the portfolio will grow as we step into 2022, again, we’ll see margin expansion opportunity relative to the underlying risk business in the portfolio. And we’ll see productivity gains additionally within our portfolio.”“And I think putting 2022 in context of our historic performance, we have a decade track record of delivering, on average, between 10% and 13% EPS growth for the franchise. And 2022 will be another year where there will be attractive organic earnings performance and very attractive capital deployment.”“As we step into 2022,…it’s demonstrating that 2022 will be another year of attractive growth. Attractive growth in terms of our earnings growth in the organization as we continue to make targeted investments within our portfolio organically.”"
Glad I bought some yesterday.
Cigna announces a quarterly dividend . $ 4.00 annually . Didn’t see that coming .
"From the PR News: for MA plan participants CIGNA will provide free transportation to vaccination sites up to 60 miles each way for 4 visits. Includes an extra adult for those who need help. Another example of CIGNA’s commitment to lower costs and improve clinical outcomes for their MA population. Should be very helpful in your State, eh Jeff?"
CI is likely to be bought out
CI is fundamentally cheap. I am a big bull on this name. This is one of just a handful of stocks out there right now that trade on fundamentals. I believe this company will continue its rise over the long haul.
This is going back to 200$ slowly. No question about it.
The are playing and dancing to the limbo song---how low can you go! To low for the investors.
Amazing how the stock continues to flounder yet no comments from the management. Management and board need to be changed. They've had the heads in the sand long enough.
"I jumped in today a little while at around $153.45-$153.55, trying to take a quick day trade ride. No way this will stay THIS far down - gonna bounce a little. Even a dead cat bounces."
Update : watching the market I’m seeing energy & healthcare sectors falling out of favor . Internet seems to have stolen the new year . While I still believe Cigna will see an earnings pop - I’m lowering the after ER range to $230-$250
"The short term chart looks favorable for CI. It is triangle, around 200+, which I think it should hit the bull eyes by earnings report date. The great part of CI is great growth rate for the next three years with low PE around 10. Health care and biopharma. sector are the only two sector that has bright future. So i think CI is the best candidate, low PE, best growth rate even better than UNH. ROE is among the best. I think CI is the low risk bet in the health care sector."
"CI is a sleeping giant, if you would ask me."
Wonder why CI underperform today? Earning is similar to peers like ANTM and UNH.
"Has any of these talking heads and bloggers really looked at the deal with ExpressScripts? It's not that bad, I think folks are concentrating on the debt - which is actually ""book debt"" and is not owed real money (yet). I think folks have forgotten that Trump had a meeting with these guys last spring. ""Nothing"" came out of that meeting, but shortly thereafter you began to see a flurry of M&A deals, and companies repositioning under a new model. Don't kid yourself folks - last year they got a glimpse of what is coming, and they are all switching to the new model. I suspect that Gaul was divided into three parts, and Cigna is grabbing the third piece. And it will probably be good. Cigna is certainly a bit later to the party, but not the last one. Once the new health care stuff is revealed by the administration, folks will see how smart a move this was - not only for Cigna, but UHC, Amazon, etc."
"$50 billion in expected operating cash flow ($40 billion in free cash flow) over the next 5 years vs. the current market cap of $70 billion is really compelling. Cigna plans to deploy an average of $8 billion per year to dividend, buybacks and some M&A. Assume $6 billion on average goes to buybacks and dividends…that is $18 per share in capital return, or roughly 9% of the current market cap. FCF yield today is 10%, growing to 15% by 2025. Cigna generated roughly $20 billion in cash flow during the past 2 years and retired roughly $10 billion in debt (also using proceeds from the Disability business sale). Most of the business is services, not insurance. Within the managed care portfolio 80% is in administrative (ASO) arrangements where Cigna does not bear underwriting risk. Estimates for Evernorth keep getting revised higher as that business is growing much faster than guidance. COVID is likely a very transitory headwind that is fully behind the company by 2023 (and partly by 2022). The company has the ability to reprice its insurance business every year as cost trends dictate. The accelerated share repurchase announced last week will take another 3% out of the share count immediately (equivalent to 60 cents in EPS accretion for 2022). How is this stock trading for less than 9X NTM EPS?!"
CI Dec 17 2021 200.0 Call can be very profitable IMO
300 end of 2022
Wow !!!! If it wasn’t so painful it would be funny.
"Any clues why CI's stock went down, rather than up? The earnings call is nothing but positive, nothing about it that shouldn't send the stock way up. Their short interest was 1.44%, not particularly high. What's going on with the constant downward pressure on a stock that could be > 200 with all that's going on in that company?"
"Hey TJ —-since the last ER, have been staying away from even looking here. READY TO RUMBLE?"
Yes yes! For 1 week I was writing about this moment. Finally the push came and on the 6th try we brake the MA50 resistance. Looking at fibo levels 1st target 216.5$ and then 220$ in sight. Above 220 will depend on the earnings release that is coming up in 2 weeks which I expect positive results. So will not be a surprise if we see 240s before year end
"Morgan Stanley conference presentation yesterday was positive.Cigna’s CEO made it clear that the company would hit its guidance for $20.20+ in EPS in 2021…which means the next 2 quarters are somewhat derisked. The company also gave color on medical cost trends in 3Q…positively, non-Covid utilization is tracking BELOW baseline as the spike in Covid cases has limited capacity for procedures in the quarter. So although COVID-19 medical costs might be higher, there may be an offset in lower than expected non-Covid medical costs. Regardless…the franchise is diverse enough to enable Cigna to deliver on its financial commitments to investors for the year…that’s the takeaway!Similarly, Cigna sees 2022 as a very good year of growth for the franchise…at least 10%. That puts EPS at $22.20+…but realistically it could be much higher than that (as I previously walked through in my analysis).So the stock at $204 is at a measly 9.1X 2022E conservative EPS guidance. By the way, Morgan Stanley is a full $1+ ahead of this EPS estimate at $23.45 for 2022. MS is also $0.50 ahead of the $20.20+ EPS guidance for 2021…so it expects a beat on EPS relative to guidance/consensus in 2H 2021 as well.Cigna CEO David Cordani said the announced ASR was management’s way of signaling to the Street that it viewed the stock as undervalued. And he affirmed his $50 bil operating cash flow target for 2021-25.The stock is a BUY."
Nice move up today !! This stock is still greatly undervalued !!
CI is trading on its own and don't followed the overall markets because it is in oversold condition.
Great buying opportunity. I bought today. Will be 250 by end of August.
What am I missing? To me this earnings report was great and the only reason it is dropping is because it barely missed analysts' predictions. $11.45 net income before reporting the buybacks is a great quarter and almost half the year's earnings. I see this as nothing but a positive but I'm here to listen to opposing perspectives.
CI can easily afford to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.01 to $0.40.
"lol, The games funds play. Sell it down after they write calls and buy puts. Then they hold it here until retail investors get tired and sell to them for a DEFLATED price. Don't sell to the #$%$"
"wait for the upside analyst upgrades, could be in the $260 share price target easily"
Earning call was good... including hint for 2022 was very positive. Don’t know how stock could be down this much... seems like buying opportunity
Still well below 20% of Credit Swiss target of $215.! Up up again.
"It is always nice to pick up those gems that have an attractive valuation, CI has been on my wish/watch list since spring. This was a good week to start a position (Tuesday), however, I wish it were larger. I only bought 125 shares, I typically only buy small lots over several days and it works about 80% of the time. Great board though, lots of useful info, thanks, and good luck & great investing."
"Wow, be very careful holding anything into earnings. This seems over sold though"
"Looking closer at the $2.50 Covid headwind for 2021/2022: With its Q2 release,Cigna increased the amount of COVID-related headwinds it expects to incur this year to$2.50 from $1.25, previously. Roughly 80% ($2.00) is related to medical cost, with theremaining $0.50 headwind relating to the economic impact of Covid (expectationsregarding the economic impact were unchanged vs prior ests). The $2.00 medical costheadwind encompasses all Covid-related costs and the anticipated MA risk adjustmentheadwind being occurred this year. Of the $1.25 increase in headwind (from $1.25 to$2.50), 50% was incurred in 2Q21, with the remainder anticipated to materialize in theback half of the year (spread evenly between 3Q/4Q). As it relates to 2022, the companyexpect to see a $1.00 EPS recoupment of the Covid-related headwind (MA riskadjustment headwind is part of this recoupment). Beyond that, Cigna currently anticipates acontinuing $1.50 headwind heading into 2022, with $0.50 tied to the economic impact ofCovid-19 and $1.00 due to ongoing Covid costs. Separately Cigna said it expects to grow‘at least’ 10% off the $20.20 baseline (suggesting at least $22.22 in 2022 EPS)"
"MOH and CNC are the most exposed, HUM could benefit The most impactful provisions from repeal would be the repeal of the individual exchanges, and Medicaid expansion. The companies most exposed to those provisions would be MOH (47% of EPS) and CNC at (40%). WCG (8%) and ANTM (6%) also have exposure. Finally, CVS’s Aetna subsidiary, CI, and UNH have limited exposure to the repeal of the ACA, with less than 2% of their earnings derived from ACA-related enrollment. Of note, these numbers are gross exposures, as there would be some offset from the repeal of the Health Insurer Fee (HIF)- 2% on average for diversified names. In fact, after factoring in the offset from the HIF, in our view diversified names would largely have a minimal impact and HUM may actually benefit from a repeal of the ACA given it has minimal ACA revenue and would benefit from a repeal of the HIF. Reform"
This will be back in the 180s within a few weeks. It’s at the bottom of the channel it’s been in lately. After that who knows when it will retest 200s.
I think this is is probably stuck in trading range of 204 to 220 (with 210 median) next catalyst either way is the senate GA run offs. A rep win in either being positive and a Democratic win in both resulting in senate majority would be negative.
Tip-Toe Thru the Tulips—-trader Jeff knows exactly what I’m talking about 
"finally we broke up on MA21 daily average but got rejected by MA50. If we can push above MA50 this week, we should easily climb back up to 220s. I expect good results on earnings report on 4th Nov. Let`s see how it goes."
"Normally I don`t track MA144, but on Friday, we tested MA144 line at 219$ and got rejected. That is to be expected. Right now we are sitting right on 0.5 fibo level at 216.25$ As long as we don`t close below this level, upward move will continue and we should continue testing MA144 at 219$. In my earlier statement, 216.5$ came, next target is 220$. Earnings right around the corner, let`s go"
Insurers up across the board today. Any idea why?
"Yesterday after the earnings perfect chance to buy first time, I am very happy to be on this board!"
CI should have gone up today. There is no reason/negative news for it to be down. I picked up 2000 shares this morning at $170.62.
"With the earnings growth over 18 % and dividends 4 bucks, the pig will fly high over 250. Don't believe me, OK? Let wait until this Thursday when UNH reports earnings in early morning, it should pop another 10-15 points, leads the whole sector to another new high. After that, ANTM will confirm at the end of the month. It is the done deal that CI will get the chance to go even higher."
"YTD Cigna is up less than a dollar . That’s ridiculously cheap considering current & forward earnings , a $6B buyback and a new $4.00 dividend ."
"earnings growth is 25%, PE is only 10. I think when the market gets better today, CI will move up higher."
Almost a $20 price swing between the morning low ( dumping on news ) and the afternoon recovery . Wow .
"Still here. You’d be paying a big premium to historical valuation for unh, currently 27PE vs 13 year median of 18. CI historical is 15 trading at 10. When express script debt is paid down CI will take off."
Debate last night should remove some of the anxiety on this stock.
"Think about this: The market cap at the close of business was $61 billion. Cigna paid $67 billion for Express Scripts. Not only has Cordani lost $6 billion from the merger, he lost all of the market cap from the old Cigna, which was close to $40 billion! Heck of a job David and board. When do the law suits start?"
"When the $165 support level holds, uptrend movement will start later today or tomorrow."
184 coming
Whats going on?
Generally agree on the health care sector—but take a look at the growth of UNH & especially Humana since last quarter —-Humana sp has crushed it about +25%. There’s no reason in my mind CIGNA can’t do the same. IMO CIGNA’s PBM side (Evernorth) has the best clinical products to contain client cost than any other. Barring an unforeseen Black Swan event (which is saying a lot these days) I would not be surprised to see 260’s by 3Q
Cigna stock price target raised to $250 from $230 at SunTrust RH https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/markets/news/story.asp?docKey=1-SN20191118005160&cid=1-SN20191118005160-MIP
COILED Spring gonna get sprung next week.
"Just read a report on HealthCare stocks to buy .It stated Cigna’s Price to Cash Flow was 9.92x as of 04–16-21 or $ 25.47 . Humana’s at 12.39x at $35.13 . Cigna dividend $4.00 or 1.59% . Humana at $2.80 or 0.636% . The article made Humana sound more compelling than Cigna based on these numbers . There’s NO question by cash flow , earnings and dividend Cigna has Humana beat by a Texas mile when you consider how much you have to pay to buy a share of each . Cigna is also knocking on the front door in the growth comparison now too ."
Why is this falling when it had a great financial quarter? New business segments growing over 20% and crazily undervalued and away from the their lowest price targets. Doesn't make sense to sell... The upside here is huge.
"I like CI at this price, I don't know what happens to the health care providers sale off. UNH will report the earnings on Wednesday morning which I expect UNH will beat the estimate as usual. I think it is the cheapest among DOW at this price."
$5 swing range today. A savvy day trader could have made 6-7% on CI today.
Wow...thanks for the gift today. I'm jumping in tomorrow after market reacts to the 8:30 jobs report. Only one price target cut from what I could tell. From $228 to $210 at CFRA. Great one year upside from here.
Well here we are . Again . Will this break out to new 52 week highs tomorrow or crash like a meteor ? Or not move at all on ER . Very hard to tell with this stocks ER history and with the market currently shrugging off some blockbuster results with a yawn .
"just bought 1,000 shares. Hopefully, it reaches all times highs by earning date."
bought in at 176 . Is there still downside ?
A good day here . It didn’t escape my notice that we saw a new 52 week high . This May inch up as we approach ER . I think it flies with ER this time .
"I'm going to start a small position today. I missed the low of $200, hopefully catch 210. CI under it's historical P/E FV, future E ests. look good, and they started a div. I think it will work for me, LT."
Cigna the most undervalued Health Care stock going into earnings IMO . The late July ER should be worth 20 points up from here at a minimum
At $208 a forward PE of 10.4 and a dividend yield of 1.92% .
Anyone have an explanation for this?
"Deal to sell parts of Int’l is smart. $5+ bil in buybacks with the proceeds. Combined with another $4-5 bil in expected buybacks from FCF and Cigna will retire another 15% or so of its share count by year end 2022. The businesses sold were non-core, although pretty profitable. Assuming $10 bil in buybacks Cigna’s share count will shrink to 280-290 mil by yr end 2022. That’s roughly 90-100 mil shares less (25-30% less) than shares outstanding after the closing of the Express Scripts deal and debt is down by $10 bil as well. Ultimately 2023 EPS will be $26-27…and the stock will be at $300 within 18-24 months."
RSI showing oversold territory
Extremely undervalued... Added more yesterday. Only upside back to recent price....
"Debt is coming down nicely, nearly 4.5 bio per year but still sits at 33bio. On the other hand debt over asset ratio is %20 and the company generates a free cash flow of 9bio average so I don`t see a risk of this debt becoming a burden. Solid company, I think it was time for profit taking as there is not much story going on. Technical side, I see it is coming down to 231 (MA 144) before starting consolidating. Might go down to 224 but I think it will bounce back from 230 range."

150 K shares at the open moves this $200 stock +7 points—-say what?
Bought my initial position today at 204.03
I gave in and sold for profits today. Too big to pass up in a short 2 months of owning it. I’ll look for a pull pack back to jump back in. Good news for all you holders. Usually when I try that it back fires and the price just keeps going up. Lol
They had some interesting insights about CI on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Incredible buying oppurtunity
Any me know why a double downgrade? Stock seems very cheap
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-1q-earnings-snapshot-101337369.html
"CLOV is ripe for the picking. It's way undervalued when you compaire it to $UNH, $CI, & $HUM. Look at the valuations. This is a good buy at this price."
"Mark this post. If you buy CI today you will be very handsomely rewarded. This is truly a over kill. There is noway Medicare for all is going to pass then all these insurance stocks will run. This is truly blood in the streets for these stocks. All had good earnings and good forward guidance. I am not saying it will start a run in the next week, but if you buy this today and put it away in a IRA you make better than 50% in the next couple years."
Every time I add to my position goes down not adding anymore so it’s safe to buy
Business rationalization or lack there of. I think some investors were expecting to hear consolidation outline and they didn't get it. Start with the duplicate Accounting and HR departments and then the low hanging fruit of numerous office space spread out around the country as easy first steps. I guess a promise or two was made but it will have to be done sooner rather than later.
"A quick sanity check on the “Medicare for All” overhang and why it’s overdone Industry Overview Equity | 01 March 2019 10 reasons why MFA has little chance of passing On Tuesday, Congress released a “Medicare for All” proposal that would completely replace the current managed care model by moving everyone to the traditional Medicare program. Although this has hurt multiples for the managed care sector, we essentially see this as an issue of headline risk with very little chance of implementation. We do expect Democrats to work towards coverage expansion, but a more likely scenario is shoring up the ACA (a clear positive for healthcare). Although we have been highlighting headline risk as the biggest risk for Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) this year, in our view valuations are overly discounting a very low likelihood event (CI is trading at 8.5x 2021 guide). Below we highlight 10 points on the “Medicare for All” (MFA) bill and why we see little chance of the bill being passed in the next 5 years. 1. There are 107 co-sponsors of this bill, underscoring the importance of the issue. However, this is below the 124 people who co-sponsored a similar bill last year. 2. There are few details on how this would work and no details on how it will be funded. Cost has sunk every such provision in the past and we think is likely the biggest roadblock this time. 3. The current Medicare program is expected to go bankrupt in 7 years. This program would cover more things than Medicare – vision, dental, hearing, LT care, have no premiums, copays or deductible and all providers will be in-network. 4. We estimate paying hospitals Medicare rates would bankrupt the industry. The Center for American Progress estimates that hospitals need to be paid 20% more than the Medicare rate and doctors need to be paid 10% more to make those businesses viable – which would make it even more difficult to finance. 5. Few (if any) industries are likely to support this proposal – beyond eliminating MCOs, it would eliminate all for-profit HC providers (hospitals, nursing homes, etc) and Medicare would negotiate drug pricing. We expect significant lobbying against this bill. 6. Simplistic view is that Dems say we don’t need managed care. Factual evidence indicates the government can’t manage utilization and MCOs must play a role. 7. Medicaid MCOs manage 51% of Medicaid spending (vs 26% 10 yrs ago) and save states 10-15% and improve quality. Dem and Republican states have moved to MCOs. 8. Medicare Advantage (MA) covers 35% of seniors (up from 25% 10 yrs ago despite rate cuts) as it is able to provide better benefits than Medicare for the same price. 9. The stars have to align. We think Dems would need to win the Presidency and the Senate (likely a large majority) to pass the bill. The President would need to make “Medicare for All” the key initiative for the agenda. 10. But even that is no guarantee - Trump failed to repeal the ACA despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (52 seats). Obama almost failed to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (a much less aggressive plan) despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (60 seats). What gets the group working? Beats and raises We forecast average annual EPS growth of 14% across the large cap MCOs over the next 3 years, and we see upside for all of them. We expect strong Q1 beats and raises, positive tone at Investor Days and regulatory clarity in May on the rebate rule (likely including a delayed implementation) which should help multiples. CI (top pick), trades at only 8.5x 2021 guidance, despite what we see as multiple levers to drive upside.

Hang on and add more if you can afford. Only reason for this drop is fear. Nothing company related.
"Are EPS estimates for 2022 too conservative?!Let’s revisit.Cigna guided to at least $20.20 for 2021 and at least 10% higher in 2022…implying $22.22.But the 2021 EPS figure was based on a avg FD share count of 344-345 mil. FD shares were around 340 mil at the time of the 10Q filing, however. With the $2 bil ASR that should fall by 9.5-10 mil going into 2022…so 330 mil. That by itself would add 60 cents to full year 2022 EPS (and 15 cents to 2021). Plus, Cigna assumes it will recover $1.00 of covid related EPS in 2022. So those items by themselves bring 2022 EPS up by $1.60 (out of the $2.02 assumed in guidance). Plus Cigna is calling for growth in both its medical business and Evernorth, with margin/efficiency improvements expected (as per the Morgan Stanley conference presentation). Plus, there will be additional shares repurchased in 2022…which will be additionally highly accretive to EPS. Plus, the sale of the international non-core business will likely be neutral to EPS (but result in another $5 bil in buybacks).So overall $10 bil in buybacks (15%+ of the current mkt cap)!And unless the core business is down in 2022 Cigna should easily meet the $22.22 EPS number it guided to and very likely HANDILY exceed it. I am at $23.50-24 for 2022…just assuming moderate core growth and continued buybacks.All thoughts welcome on my math or otherwise."
CI is way under valued.
"Just trying to analyze, any thoughts on how the new drug price executive order (if hoes in to effect) can impact health insurance providers?"
"Too funny that they are trying to keep it down. ANTM up over 3.2%, UNH up over 2.5%, and CI only up 1.7%....Really? I bought options at the open and they are already in the money and will continue to gain value in to the close."
Sold all my positions a month ago around $160 and moved into HUM with a nice profit already. I advise you all to do the same
"Momentum wise Cigna is currently weak despite hitting a new 52 week high Thursday .That being said , management has instituted a solid $4.00 dividend and committed to buying back stock & reducing debt to match its peer group .Further , they have the earnings , cash flow and recent $6B cash divesture funds to do exactly that . If there was ever a stock primed to run .... this one is . Political risk and market risk not withstanding ."
I’m really struggling with trying to fully understand why Cigna is so much more impacted by the weakness in this sector than the other names . Yes the Pharmacy business issues are part of the answer but the Co is none the less outperforming all the rest % wise with revenue and earnings and trading at a much lower PE .
Chewy- Healthcare moving up this week in tandem I’m feeling better about Cigna’s chances of popping on earnings ( one direction or the other lol )
"With earnings on 7/31, this should be flying. IMO earnings will be spectacular and we should touch 210"
"I just wanted the retail investors to be aware that CI believes their stock is undervalued which is why they are doing accelerated share repurchases. BUT please read the news release, this is NOT a NEW share repurchase . This is accelerating purchases of the remaining (existing $3.8B) plan that is already in place. GLTA"
"Let’s do some arithmetic!Earnings estimates revisited:2021: $7 bil in adjusted earnings divided by 340 mil shares equals $20.58 in EPSAssume 5% earnings growth in 2022 (that’s just recovering the $1/sh in COVID costs) = $7.35 bil in adjusted earnings. That assumes ZERO core growth. Divide by 320 mil shares = $22.97 in EPS.Assume 8-9% in adjusted earnings growth in 2023 (that just recoups the full Covid impact with minimal core growth in the business) = $8.0 bil. Divide by 310 mil shares =$25.80 in EPS.But I’m going to assume some core growth in the business in both years. Let’s say 2% in 2022 (bringing adjusted earnings to $7.5 bil), and 4% in 2023 plus recovery of full COVID costs (bringing adjusted earnings to $8.35 bil). That gets me to EPS in 2022 of $23.44 and in 2023 of $26.95.Guidance is $20.20+ for 2021 and $22.20+ for 2022. Cmon…does this not seem overly conservative?!"
"Bought at $145ish, hoping for a pop and have a cushion for some downside. No way national healthcare will pass. Insurance and medical lobbies too strong. Doesn't matter if the people want it or not. Besides, someone has to service all the customers before the bill gets paid by the Gov't. Buy on fear is a win for me."

It is trading at only 12 times estimated 2018 earningsIt can run up to $200 per share in the next few months I am buyer
for a rare co that reaffirms 2020 guidance this thing is trading so poorly its not even funny... while Nikola haven't made a truck yet has a $20B market cap... #$%$..
It's not that often that you get a chance to take advantage of a complete misread by the market. After the dust settles this is going straight to $220 before meandering higher.
I’m looking at jumping in on CI. After some research I can’t tell What is bringing the stock price down. Any insight?
Last thought before market - guess I’ll have to hope that they’ve decided to start buybacks this morning lol
"HEY BAGGIES: WHO DROPPED THE Q ON PBMs to the tune of multi millions of dollars social media advertising attacking the the PBM model. Example: if you are a FB user, you get more than a dozen anti-PBM ads per hour. BU-BYE CAREMARK. Just go look for yourself...tune in and watch America ""roast the PBMs"" Check it out on CI too."
locked in a bit of profit today... CS price target remains 260 but not sure if thats too optimistic
I dipped my toe in at $208. Very small amount. I’ll add if it goes down. Hope this was good entry.￼
"Great news for ReWalk for a major insurance agency like $CI to make changes to their policy regarding exoskeleton devices and those in need. Volume is great off the open, now let's see a push to .50 https://stockwatchers.finance.blog/2019/02/13/3-healthcare-stocks-setting-the-pace-on-wednesday/"
Can someone explain what is the logic behind the 12% drop. I thought the earnings report was positive and beat the expected on all measures.
"BofA downgrade is a buying opportunity! Analyst’s rationale is he is not sure about earnings visibility due to a bit of confusion around guidance provided on the 2Q call and likely higher 3q/4q medical costs. CI just reiterated guidance a week ago and the ASR should add some cushion to that given the healthy 60 cents of annual EPS accretion from buying in 3% of the FD OS in one quarter. So there is upside to his numbers, in contrast to what he says in his note.On top of that, he says 10X is the right multiple for the business because it is somewhat slower growing and that has been the avg multiple since the Express Scripts deal was announced. More poor logic here. Cigna’s business is much less capital intensive as it’s 70+% services and 80% ASO in the MCO space. That allows for 10-13% EPS growth when including reinvestment of FCF, on par with other MCOs. Why is 10X the right multiple for a capital light FCF machine that grows earnings HSD organically? CI said it will generate $50 bil in operating cash flow in the 2021-2025 timeframe. That’s relative to the current $68 bil mkt cap…pretty compelling.Who cares if 3q/4q have higher medical costs?! It means little when focusing on the intermediate term earnings power of the business as pricing/plan structures can be adjusted for 2022 and beyond to incorporate Covid related costs. Ultimately these are transitory headwinds that won’t affect 2023 earnings (my EPS estimate is $27 assuming 310 mil shares vs 330 mil shares post ASR completion). Put 10x (even if that’s a conservative multiple)on that Kevin and you get $270.Underperform? Really? Seems like this guy’s analyst skills are underperforming since he was touting the stock $65 points higher."
Had to get in at this level. Can’t see much more of a downside with the latest earnings report as well as the P/E ratio.
"could it be, finally a rebound... will it be sustained? I hope so. this is easily worth 180"
Valuation is dropping based on the perception that earnings in 2022 are under pressure from continued COVID costs and an uptick in standard medical costs which are coming back up to historical trends .
thank you Carl
Very similar thing happened to CRSR on Aug 3. (Huge drop on decent report).CRSR recovered as of now. Let us see about CI.
Yup bought last dip sold 211 bought again 203 will go to 210 or so sell rinse wash repeat
"@Chewdog : I think you once said - what a difference a week makes . Boy doesn’t it ! Looking at the other two big players that I watch ( Humana & United Health ) to gain some context - the sector now appears to be moving higher -together - with 2 of the 3 hitting fresh 52 week highs for the week , Humana trailing by only a small handful of points .Cigna has reached my initial target of $260 however fundamentals have turned more positive as well as the overall market .Guessing here that the entire sector moves 10% higher in the short term if the market stays green . That puts Cigna at $280-$290 . My revised target price is $300-$320 . Cigna has more ground to cover than the other two I watch as it’s stock price has been depressed . Could Cigna do a stock split ? A thought . The last one was in 2007 . But splits aren’t as popular now with BOD’s . I do think it would help the stock price if one were declared - but let’s not hold our breath waiting for it .Given the above .... I purchased a tranche of Cigna $262.50 calls before the close on Friday . It’s a simple gamble on Cigna as well as the rest of the group - moving 5-10% higher in the short term ."
"Today’s press release on “integrated care” is the perfect storm. It’s been what I have been touting as the benefit from buying Express Scripts:When you have ONE view of the COMPLETE patient; rx’s filled or sometimes more importantly, maintenance meds for high blood pressure etc late to be refilled, or not filled at all, and the complete medical history of the patient, there is no one else better to assess the current condition of the patient. Traditional pharmacies only see pharmacy claims. Doctors only see what THEY ALONE prescribed. CIGNA’s integrated care model brings all this data under one roof, in one place, where sophisticated algorithms and teams of pharmacists and nurses identify patients most likely to have an adverse medical event. These patients or their prescribers are contacted to try and avoid that ‘upcoming adverse event’. Avoiding the cost of even one visit to the ER or even a fall leading to an ER visit with a hip fracture and orthopedic surgery and a protracted recovery in a rehab center is incredible is directly measurable in dollars saved. Take for example, the patient above who falls, goes to ER, hip replacement, extended stay in rehab center (think Covid now)—-> how do you measure the psychological toll this takes on the patient and their families ?This happening to a grandparent can directly impact easily 100 members of their families with worry, days taken off from work, transportation, etc. The psychological costs can never be measured. How do you place a $ value on grief?Disclaimer: I do not work for CIGNA, but do own the stock."
Strong close would be a plus for upside.
Any news on why Cigna is up 5% today on heavy volume?
"I saw 4 valuations Attrix, GuruForce etc based on FCF... all shows above $300 price...and stock is at $199. Funny d way momentum works over Fundamental.... any thoughts ?"
Loaded some up at 168.21
"From Credit Suisse.........Raising 2021 EPS to $20.34; 2022 EPS to $22.40: We are raising our 2021 EPS to$20.34 from $20.25 (guidance calls for ‘at least $20.20’) and 2022 EPS to $22.40 from$22.25 (company 2Q21 commentary indicated ‘at least ~$22.22’) as we factor in thecompany’s ASR program while adjusting our overall future outlook for share repurchases.As a reminder, the company’s outlook includes the potential impact of future sharerepurchases, and the company at their 4Q20 earnings call previously indicated they had$6.6 bln available for share repurchases and strategic M&A."
"MDLIVE—-brilliant move: congrats guys & girls. Could be in response to several things: multiple clients/patients asking about it, maybe a State added the tele-MD as a requirement to conduct business in the particular state, or in response to a very large RFP."
CI beats estimates good buy
"So far UNH and ANTM posted better than expected EPS, driven partly by a lower MLR as non-covid utilization surprised favorably, more than offsetting higher covid costs. Cash flow was also very strong for both.Can we anticipate the same for Cigna? In September the company presented at the MS conference and called out industry trends that included higher covid cases but lower non-covid utilization. Cigna also reiterated its 2021 and 2022 earnings targets.I think shorts need to start worrying here. If Cigna beats on MLR, produces strong FCF, at least reiterates EPS targets, and nothing stupid comes out of Congress we may get a pretty powerful move to the upside in the stock.At 9.5X somewhat depressed 2022 EPS with 15% of the shares outstanding likely to be repurchased in 2022 the stock is still a bargain."
My comment on the ER - solid results - management is being very conservative with the estimates on 2021 EPS with their statement about the same . This is poised to hit $300-$320 this year .
Next catalyst is the late July ER . I can’t think of any reason why it won’t be a tremendously positive report .
Last thought on CI today: Their earnings are up 8% ttm and there's about 5% less shares in existence than there were a year ago. Mid-February last year their shares were going for around $220. I feel good about where Cigna is right now and my investment.
Cigna would be in the 220’s this morning absent that bogus BofA downgrade .
Leon Cooperman is one of the most respected investors on Wall Street. Only two weeks ago he had CI as one of his top seven value stock holdings. And that's when CI was 227. So even with the miss CI is still a good stock to hold. It's more likely to see 225 then 185.
"How can you go wrong with a Company, according to the synopsis here, founded in 1792."
"5 day we tested MA50 and so far again we are rejected. Standing behind my earlier statement, if we can break up the MA50 resistance, the road ahead will be much positive but I guess all the algorithm trading is wired to sell at MA50 and buy at MA21 so we oscillate in between. Seems we have to wait for earnings release"
"Bill, was this a wholesale downgrade of healthcare stocks? There are many other HC stocks down today, though none as bad as CI."
The ER and guidance is outstanding . As a business Cigna is running on all cylinders . Forward PE is around 7x earnings . Fully valued this should be well over $200 no question about it . Buy & hold a good bet here .Trading it is much tougher .
