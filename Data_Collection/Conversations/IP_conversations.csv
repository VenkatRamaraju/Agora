from 2020 full year SEC filing. Printing papers were about 24% of total revenue and about 13% of gross profits (my math). What's left looks pretty interesting...........Kel
4.5% increasing dividend + $2 billion buyback + 6.1 P/E << ======= seems like a bargain What am I missing?
I believe this can be classified as a “buying opportunity”!!
Looks like a lot of selling today of Sylvamo and buying IP
what's going on today.dont see any news
Entire sector taking a hit today. Industry numbers just came out for third quarter and stats were disappointing. Shipments down and inventories up. Exports also up which is usually an indication domestic demand slowing.I think this is supply chain related and an over reaction. Paper and packaging is lower sector and the totem pole when trucking becomes tight. Product is a low priced bulky commodity that takes up a lot of room in a truck. Tough to compete with other industries who are willing to pay more for trucks. Plus with goods being backed up in ports there is less demand from packers who are out of goods.Unfortunately until first industry earnings report comes out later this month there is going to be pain.
If you add back the Sylvamo valuation IP's technicals are starting to look better. Needs to get back over $56 and hold.
"I have always been tempted to get on the CC and ask this question:Dear Mr. Sutton: On August 1, 2018 your stock was trading at $48.50, a full $1.00 above where it is trading today 3 and a half years later. Yet every quarter you come on the CC and claim that IP is performing well. Can you elaborate on what you mean by ""performing well"" and do you feel that the current stock price fully reflects all the great strides IP has made under your leadership over the past 3 and a half years? Finally, what would you tell a stock investor in IP today? Thank you."
"IP is an easy stock for analysts to push around, up or down. However, the earnings continue to look better than expectations. This and the ongoing buyback, will prevent anymore meaningful downside. Value line has 2-4 year target of $120+.Continual very good earnings do add up over time."
Not a good earnings report. PKG best in class had the same supply chain issues and knocked it out of the park. It's a very simple business and you just need to execute.
"IP stock price is in a really bad place. Technicals are bad and until the spin off is complete there is no support. People are just guessing how low the dividend will be reduced. Based on the spin off ratio it should be about a 9 to 10% reduction, but based on how it is currently trading it could be worse.At least IP's debt will be reduced appreciably."
IP is down 4.92% to 50.43
Anyone see the SLVM shares in their account yet?
"Well as stated in the earnings report they received the 1.4 billion and 19.9 % of sylvamo stock. Input costs was the reason for miss. Reduced debt by 235 million don't he quarter. Repurchased 3,6 million shares. Said they will use the money to continue buying back shares and reducing debt. Earnings to increase over next 2 years due to cost cutting, share buy backs, higher margins, and reorganizing from the spin off. Probably a buying opportunity hear. JMO. Staying long collecting my dividends"
I do not have much BUT if it gets back to higher 50’s I will make my 30% and ease on down the road.. I do not know what will happen to THEIR FREE stock after I sell my IP but I guess I will at that time. Does ANYONE?
"OK....so we didn't get the ""POP"" we expected. Nothing wrong with the EPS, and Revenues. Continuing to buyback shares each quarter. CEO was ""adamant"" about continuing to grow and sustain the dividend. Cash flow to grow from $1.8B in 2018 to $2B in 2019. 4.2% dividend yield, low p/e, ........hey it's a great value stock , it's not going to move +/- 20% on earnings, like a growth stock."
"Just an FYI......if you listened to the most recent CEO presentation from IP he was asked a question about the stock performance. He stated that IP over the next 2 quarters would perform well and that Wall Street and the stock price would come to understand the earnings power, and cash flow that this company has. These large investment houses are ""notorious"" for issuing both upgrades and downgrades in an attempt to move the stock to where they can either buy it or sell it in a way that benefits their customer. Hey can you blame them....that is what they get paid for. I can tell you from personal experience that if you do the opposite of what these guys ""SAY"" they are doing .....it usually turns out well. Come back to this post on February 1, 2019 (the day after the IP earnings release), and let's see who is right. I'm not saying I know for sure what will happen, all I'm saying is the CEO comments don't match WFC's bearish view."
I have just seen secret information( from very deep sources) that indicates IP stock could go up or down.
IP is down 4.93% to 53.06
"Cash about $700MM, DEBTS $7BB,Way over valued"
anyone see slvm trading. Price?
Does anyone know when the lockout on the Sylvamo stock is off?
"acc to SEC filings 1 share for every 9 shares of IP. No date stated in filing, only 2021"
"I recently saw an interesting article written by an analyst from ""Simply Wall Street"". He makes a lot of assumptions, but his estimated valuation shows IP is currently trading at approximately a 24% discount. I agree with his analysis, but think there are many other stocks also trading at a discount from there discounted cash flow value."
Where is the bottom? 42? 39?
"Yeah I also bought couple days ago for yield. Retired now, so dividend is great and safe for now. I'll buy more if it drops anymore. We will always need boxes and fluff products (hygiene products). I think if they ever crack down on plastics , paper products will increase again. Long IP!!! Just send me my quarterly check!!"
EPS estimates for 2022? Anything out there for 2022 so far adjusted for the spinoff. Still looking for the rev and EPS uipdates. Printing papers were 24% of rev in 2020 and about 13% of gross profit. Thanks.....Kel
"I was recycling cardboard boxes from recent covid19 related Amazon purchases today and couldn't help but notice that most of the boxes came from International Paper... Makes you wonder how the virus is impacting the company's operations. I'd say I feel very positive about the business in times when so many people are ordering products from home, but it's debt burden and low cash on hand are worrisome. Thoughts?"
I am a current employee for IP and stay busy with business so idk why it has dropped like this. It really is a great company and just going to get bigger and better so I believe its undervalued really
Have they said what the sip off ratio and date will be?
Has IP mentioned what happens to the dividend after the paper spinoff???
It's still amazing to me that Yahoo Finance can't report ALL the news on a stock in a timely manner. Just found this today 1/6/2020 that on 12/10/2019 Goldman Sachs downgraded IP from neutral to sell and put a $40 price target on it. Meanwhile BNP upgraded IP on 12/2 to OUTPERFORM with a $53 price target. I guess we will see on January 30th who is right.
Has ANYONE received anything from IP on this? Only thing I see is that they ARE going to BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM IP! This is not anyway to keep Stockholders informed!!!
"International Paper Announces $2 Billion Share Repurchase Program; Decreases Cash Dividend 9.8% to $1.85 per Share Annually10/12/2021MEMPHIS, Tenn., Oct. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- International Paper today announced its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of the company's common stock.

"Poor number due to Supply Chain...........if everything is sitting in port, it is not being shipped to stores or consumers. Fewer boxes being used, plain and simple."
"They must have paid the dividend, stock price is down..."
We just had what they call a golden cross in the short term vs long term moving avg. Supposed to be a bullish sign . Looks like it wants to move higher.
GLAD I SOLD @ $53.91 $$$$$$ I was sweating when it was going back down last week!!!!When it gets back down to $38 Will give it another go! IF IP LOOKS STABLE!
I'm holding onto my Sylvamo shares as well as my IP. Read somewhere that they could be take over target. Also said they may pay a dividend. We will see.
"One reason I bought IP is for the dividend, and the other reason almost everything comes in a box."
