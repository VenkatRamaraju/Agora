Staple products bit cyclical but operation can be flexed. Nice dividend. I just pray mgmt treads carefully next couple years
what is happening with the new paper/box board plant being built on the east coast I forgot the name? is IP losing contracts already.
"Just picked up some great shares of IP. Reasons: Beat quarterly earnings big time past 3 quarters, tons of cash on hand and not much more debt, relatively cheap price and a Fantastic 4% dividend!! Can you say Winner??"
"Just an FYI......if you listened to the most recent CEO presentation from IP he was asked a question about the stock performance. He stated that IP over the next 2 quarters would perform well and that Wall Street and the stock price would come to understand the earnings power, and cash flow that this company has. These large investment houses are ""notorious"" for issuing both upgrades and downgrades in an attempt to move the stock to where they can either buy it or sell it in a way that benefits their customer. Hey can you blame them....that is what they get paid for. I can tell you from personal experience that if you do the opposite of what these guys ""SAY"" they are doing .....it usually turns out well. Come back to this post on February 1, 2019 (the day after the IP earnings release), and let's see who is right. I'm not saying I know for sure what will happen, all I'm saying is the CEO comments don't match WFC's bearish view."
The largest company for paper. Plastic is being banned and there is a new paradigm. Paper is the new plastic. As large cites continue to ban all forms of plastic take out packaging this company will fill the void.
Guys please don't Day trade IPNFF. Hold it. Trust me you won't regret it. Shorts just got burned. The CEO has fantastic plans for this company. We just signed a 5 year partnership with the NFL Alumni with shared revenue. That's a huge deal. Allen Paul will be presenting again next week on Wednesday. I bet anyone that we get news again next week. End of Year $1 USD at a minimum. I advise new investors to look at the interview from yesterday it's very informing and a fantastic confidence booster. #IP LONG AND STRONG
"Solid second quarter results in the face of difficult economic conditions. Some takeaways.....Very weak printing pulp market was just a minor drag.Costs are being controlled very well.Quarter bodes well for remainder of the year and going forward.India charge will hopefully be another reminder to stop bad acquisitions ( I believe the deal guys are all gone).Analysts are still fighting the wars of the past.Going forward IP should focus on increasing dividends, buying back stock and cutting debt."
"Bearish , I feel like IP is paying down debt to take on more. I feel once the spin-off happens in the 3rd quarter that they already have their sites on an acquisition. For which they always overpay. At which I believe the stock will fall to 38-42 range. Every CEO likes to put their stamp on their tenure, this one other than spinoff of printing papers has not yet beware."
"Share buyback , Dividend boost !! Confident company !!! Buy buy buy !!!!"
"So earnings beat?So there are no problems?So we just ""erased"" $20 worth of share price (between June and now) for ""fun""? For nothing?No recession? No panic?Well that is ""wonderful"". Everything is fine, EXCEPT that shareholders took a $20 per share ""haircut"" for no apparent reason.So, if that is the case, and ""nothing is wrong"", when do we go back to the $60 per share level???"
"I was recycling cardboard boxes from recent covid19 related Amazon purchases today and couldn't help but notice that most of the boxes came from International Paper... Makes you wonder how the virus is impacting the company's operations. I'd say I feel very positive about the business in times when so many people are ordering products from home, but it's debt burden and low cash on hand are worrisome. Thoughts?"
Well the news about the miss on earnings and revenues obviously was out several days ago!!
"I have always been tempted to get on the CC and ask this question:Dear Mr. Sutton: On August 1, 2018 your stock was trading at $48.50, a full $1.00 above where it is trading today 3 and a half years later. Yet every quarter you come on the CC and claim that IP is performing well. Can you elaborate on what you mean by ""performing well"" and do you feel that the current stock price fully reflects all the great strides IP has made under your leadership over the past 3 and a half years? Finally, what would you tell a stock investor in IP today? Thank you."
thank God
And now Door Dash gets $250MM to expand food delivery to the home (8/17/2018). Gee .....I wonder if they will use any BOXES??
$IP.CN bullish!! Shoutout to #PAULPICK2020
"UBS initiated coverage today for IP( p/t $40), and PKG (p/t $146) with a sell rating for both. UBS also initiated coverage for WestRock (p/t $59) with a buy. UBS last covered International Paper in 2012. When IP was trading at $27.00 last March, no word from UBS. They must be short!"
For sure you can guarantee on line sales will only get bigger and bigger in the future so I don't see boxes and paper going away any time soon. Just wait when the DEM wits take over for sure all the plastic will be replaced by paper and boxes. Just look at straws today. Get you shares of IP on any pull backs. I we have anymore.
Have they said what the sip off ratio and date will be?
"If you wait to sell , I am sure you will get a lot more for your shares , But if you need to go ahead , but at least do it smartly with option that will get you more than just selling the shares."
1/6/2020---Stephens Company advises that Domtar raised pulp prices. The firm thinks the move could signal a bottom for the pulp market.
"Last month Goldman and BMO capital slashed earnings and price targets for IP. They both warned about falling container board prices and new capacity to soon come on line from competitors. Goldman and BMO must have been short IP, going into the downgrades. Analysts overlooked the fact that IP does have a balance of business which includes printing papers, cellulose fibers and recycling facilities, that do add to the support of overall profits and growth. They have 29 mills, 170 converting and packaging plants,16 recycling plants and 3 bag facilities in the U.S. In addition to operations worldwide. So, the buyback of $2 billion + will startup 48 hours after earnings are released, early next week. With a market cap od $17.5 billion, $2 billion = 11.5% of the outstanding shares. Value line has a $90-$135 target price on IP, in 3-5 years. This stock got pushed around hard by those big investment firms who have targeted IP as an easy short. It can only go up from here. Should be in the upper $40's soon, with the buyback kicking in next week. Last week, Jim Cramer also went negative on IP, which was a mistake, based upon analyst pressure and weaker cardboard, open market pricing."
I'm holding onto my Sylvamo shares as well as my IP. Read somewhere that they could be take over target. Also said they may pay a dividend. We will see.
"IP is hiring, their competition is laying off"
"IP is an easy stock for analysts to push around, up or down. However, the earnings continue to look better than expectations. This and the ongoing buyback, will prevent anymore meaningful downside. Value line has 2-4 year target of $120+.Continual very good earnings do add up over time."
"this companys platform is utterly amazing. I love the hologram quality and the fact that they can source multiple people as 3d AR holographic assets from anywhere in the world and put them together as holograms in their custom AR Global stages. the Global stage concept is already gaining fruition and I can only imagine this along with a few others $IP and $NTAR paving the way for AR in 2020 and beyond, these types of technology are what apple, google , microsoft, snapchatz facebook, all WANT and NEED. this space will be growing weekly as the year progresses. AR is the new tech of the post covid world. this includes 3D assets(holograms), geolocating and geoplanting said 3D assets, virtual conferences with AR, and the marketting industry with advertisable 3D assets instead of 2d images for advertising. Folks this is the future of business. Augmented Reality."
"What I am,hearing is the market is very soft for their product lines. They are basically just a commodity producer with ""no moat"" and easy entry from competitors. They sold the complex product lines and decided to focus on commodities. Can't help but be bearish on their decision quality."
Well they keep making progress buying back shares and paying down debt. One day they will be rewarded. Until then I'll keep collecting the nice dividend.
"Just putting this on here for ""educational"" purposes. Making a public prediction of whether a company will meet/beat/exceed on their next earnings report is just a guess. But Jim Cramer is predicting that IP will miss on their next earnings report as he proclaimed on MAD Money 7/3/19. We'll see........soon."
"Better start locking in yield your going to need it. IP is a great 5% dividend payer today and for sure Amazon and all the on line retail are not going to stop needing boxes. If anything it just keeps growing,"
Looks like a lot of selling today of Sylvamo and buying IP
Has IP mentioned what happens to the dividend after the paper spinoff???
"Poor number due to Supply Chain...........if everything is sitting in port, it is not being shipped to stores or consumers. Fewer boxes being used, plain and simple."
WOW did Amazon day cause all the online retailors to need a ton of boxes and more paper just to ship all of them orders. I would not be surprised if IP had to raise it's forecast for this Q just because of Amazon day. WOW
"It's amazing what the market makers can do to stocks on a ""quadruple witching"" day. Thank God I have a big position in the semis today to offset IP. These moves are not caused by ""investors"" they are caused by high frequency traders and the options guys. Go to ride thru this type of day, can turn on a dime."
Looks like the Wells Fargo analyst just but a buy on IP with his price target of $43 some one should tell him the stocks trading at $37 LOL. If he really wants to down grade it's he needs to have a lower price target than it's trading at . LOL
I saw where ip is planning on selling brazilian containerboard interest fo 65 million after paying more than 400 million for it a few years ago
"This is indicating big.. and no IT is NOT JUSt the first media announcement. The volume on this has been insane last few days.. something big is up. the LvL2 prices, there is a mountain of bids and asks at 0.56 right now.. #moneyRUSH. $ipnff $ip rocket to the moon isnt enough... this is pluto bound. Also I pity those who sold (weak paper hands make me sik)"
"IP stock price is in a really bad place. Technicals are bad and until the spin off is complete there is no support. People are just guessing how low the dividend will be reduced. Based on the spin off ratio it should be about a 9 to 10% reduction, but based on how it is currently trading it could be worse.At least IP's debt will be reduced appreciably."
"acc to SEC filings 1 share for every 9 shares of IP. No date stated in filing, only 2021"
"GPK has strong earnings and Goldman raised GPKprice target significantly. IP should aquire GPK,and add their significant earnings to IP."
Does anyone know when the lockout on the Sylvamo stock is off?
Looks like the retest of the $36.45 is now in play lower highs equal lower lows or the retest of $36.45
I bought today during after hours at $45.64. I hope I did not make a mistake.
"IP is a conservative company except for acquisitions where they tend to over pay. That Smurfit run is still a 15-20% overhang. As a long time shareholder I want IP to increase dividends, reduce debt, buy back stock at attractive prices and pick up attractive assets at bargain pricing. Forget about mega mergers. We should all be happy that failed. You buy IP for cash flow. I just picked up another 500 shares over the last week and will be a buyer on any weakness providing entire economy does not tank. I am hoping recent personnel changes indicate acquisitions are now on back burner.Last I am not overly concerned about machine conversions in the north country."
"Getting ready to go on vacation here. But before I go, In the last couple of days, I have seen an article that says that the 2nd half of 2018 will be rocky and difficult; and then I have seen an article claiming that the 2nd half of 2018 will be good. Both cannot be right. One must be wrong. Given the trade war issues and problems, I assume the second case to be incorrect. Also troubling is the forestry and timber article which I mentioned previously. I don't get warm and fuzzy feelings from that. Without another sufficient upswing in IP, I could be VERY STUCK here. Thinking further about that article, ""it fits too well"" with the troubles we have been seeing here. The stock sells off (for what was assumed to be a correction, and now seems certain to be more than a correction), the CFO leaves, and now this tea-leaf article that predicts a downturn in the forestry (and other) sector. Seems the selloff last month was about a LOT MORE than the CFO.Hard to see whats coming here.Love to hear the thoughts of all others here on this."
"Hey .....let's hear some ""educated guesses"". Estimate is $0.99/share. I'll start.....$1.08/share, but revenues will be flat to down 2%."
the stay at home economy needs more packaging ...IP should do very well
FYI.....On 12/2/2019 Exane BNP Paribas initiates IP with an OUTPERFORM rating and a $53 price target. They did the same rating on WRK but with a $48 price target. Just thought you would want to know.
every week for recycling pickup I see everyone's bins overfull of cardboard from online purchases. I don't see any slowdown in the near future.
"Just a side note here. I live in Maine and the local Wal-Mart just ""discontinued the use of plastic bags"". Now all customers need to either bring their own cloth bags, or if they don't have a bag, brown paper bags are used. They tell me this will go nationwide . I guess people are sick of those bags showing up in the environment and believe that paper bags will breakdown in the environment. After all it's just fiber, like trees, twigs, and leaves on the ground. If this does go nationwide for Walmart others will follow and FIBER will increase in price due to a significant shift in demand."
"Found this news today: (don't know if it's calls or puts or some hybrid strategy involving both; I'm not an options guy)I'm guessing that the options activity IS about Smurfit and tomorrow (D-Day), and whatever outcome is hovering over us all. _____________________________News & EventsPrint Format Change Text Size:Default text sizeA Larger text sizeA Largest text sizeAUnusually active option classes on open June 5th (TheFlyOnTheWall)BY The Fly— 9:40 AM ET 06/05/2018Unusual total active option classes on open include: Scorpio Tankers (STNG) , Taiwan Semi (TSM), First Solar (FSLR) , International Paper (IP) , EBay (EBAY) , Under Armour Class A (UAA), UNG (UNG), Starbucks (SBUX) , JD.com (JD) , and Deere (DE)."
I'm thinking about buying after this little correction if over--I suppose around the end of the week. Any suggestions?Good luck!
"Yeah I also bought couple days ago for yield. Retired now, so dividend is great and safe for now. I'll buy more if it drops anymore. We will always need boxes and fluff products (hygiene products). I think if they ever crack down on plastics , paper products will increase again. Long IP!!! Just send me my quarterly check!!"
"Today is 9/9/2019.....if you ever thought about adding either Westrock or IP to your portfolio today is the day to do it. Westrock's announcement of shutting down a linerboard machine and taking 288,000 tons of linerboard off the market shifts the supply demand balance. Price increases will follow, and that additional revenue falls directly to the bottom line. That's why IP and Westrock are UP today. GLTA."
IP really needs to do a BIG dividend boost.
I cannot believe UBS put out a SELL rating on IP when they've blow away their earnings for the past 3 quarters!! Coincided with X dividend date too!!
Just when I felt better about IP .. Cramer said he likes it !!!
"IP could take a BIG leap up on this earnings report. The analyst are not expecting much from them but I took the regular dividend payment as a ""positive"" sign."

"They tendered for their Corporate Debt which shows Strength...earnings should show a big beat be long , be patient , be a winner ."
It is clear that this stock was manipulated. There was no reason for it to drop so drastically. Too bad the SEC is incapable of investigating the “illegal” role of hedge funds and their PR reprentatives.
"Looks like GS downgraded IP because the earnings last Q were down over 30% and it looks like they have dropped the earnings forecast down 37% this Q so IP can beat them , Earnings are dropping faster than a MACY's or a BBBY I did not know IP was in the mall. LOL,LOL"
"Uggghh. (sigh)_____________________Analyst Actions: International Paper Downgraded To Sector Perform, Price Target Cut To $47 From $54BY MT Newswires— 6:39 AM ET 04/05/201906:39 AM EDT, 04/05/2019 (MT Newswires) -- International Paper (IP) received an investment-rating downgrade Friday to sector perform from outperform from RBC Capital Markets, which said it expects ""increased scrutiny of the containerboard market due to softening demand and fears of incremental capacity coming online will likely keep a lid on packaging valuations.""The firm also reduced its price target on the shares of the producer of packaging, pulp and paper products to $47 each from $54. This brings the target slightly below the stock's Thursday closing price of $47.31. The shares slipped 0.9% to $46.89 during Friday pre-market trading.In a note to clients, RBC said its new price target on the stock largely reflects a lower target multiple due to a contraction in sector multiples for containerboard-focused companies.The firm described International Paper (IP) as a ""great company in tough market conditions."" It noted both industry data and major industry players are reporting market weakness, with International Paper (IP) and WestRock (WRK) both announcing extended market downtime in Q1 in response to weakening demand.RBC said it believes International Paper (IP) should trade in the middle of the range relative to large US paper and forest-products companies. It cited ""negative sentiment on the [containerboard] industry, and 'late-cycle' fears which have deflated sector valuation multiples, partially offset by positive near-term outlook on its printing papers segment.""Price: 46.94, Change: -0.37, Percent Change: -0.78MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

"I came in at the close with 300 shares. Got to take a chance sometime, and this is a well managed company with a good balance sheet that I can't believe has gotten this low. So many of those names out there, but it is ridiculous that this many years of growth got chopped off in three weeks."
"This dead stock will go lower by year end. ""They're a play on worldwide growth and there isn't enough, so we're going to stay away from IP,"" said Jim Cramer. Let's check out a few charts and indicators and see if they agree. In this daily bar chart of IP, below, we can see a downtrend playing out over the past twelve months. Prices made lower lows into late December and while prices have just broken (by just a hair) the November highs, I would consider the downtrend still in force."
from 2020 full year SEC filing. Printing papers were about 24% of total revenue and about 13% of gross profits (my math). What's left looks pretty interesting...........Kel
anyone see slvm trading. Price?
"Can't find any reason for today's increase, but Ill take it."
I live in small apartment building in NYC and I cannot tell you how many amazon packages are delivered here everyday. Maybe 20 or 30 (mine included). Every single one of them comes in a box made by IP. Christmas is coming and is expected to be very good. Analyst estimates for this company are still i the $5+ range for this year and next. Add in an almost 4% dividend and it sure seems like a reasonable speculation at these levels.
"Don’t worry. Trump’s tariffs and his ordering of US business to leave China will be a boon to the market. Also, his upcoming trade war with the EU should help all American companies.The S&P should continue its spectacular rise on Friday. God has Trump’s back."
Here's one more reason you can't trust analyst. 1/23/2019--Stephens raises IP price target from $50 to $60 raises to OVERWEIGHT from equal weight1/28/2019--Barclays cuts IP from $44 to $41--maintains UNDERWEIGHT2/1/2019--RBC raises IP price target to $54 from $49--maintains OVERWEIGHTBetter off doing your own research and not listening to any of these guys as we have NO SYSTEM for revisiting calls and creating a record of who is right or wrong on their calls.
"Analysts have said that competition has added capacity and inventories have also increased. As a result, price cuts for container board will follow. However, it is possible that this group can still manage pricing and protect margins and avoid dumping excess product on the market. Container board and paper related products are still in a long term gradual growth mode."
"Looking at Stockcharts on the daily setting (IP), one item which becomes plainly evident is that the 50 DMA ($53.62) is trending upwards towards the 200 DMA ($55.59). If IP has a fairly brief correction and then resumes the climb, then that trend towards a golden cross should continue. I am a lousy judge of distances, lengths and times, however, just for the sake of arguement, I will estimate that a golden cross should happen in the next 2-4 weeks (assuming a relatively brief correction and resumption of the prevailing upward trend).For those who know what a golden cross is all about; once it occurs, boom, kapow, upwards goes the share price.Maybe (just ""maybe"") that is how we get to $63 and $65????Will have to watch that one closely also......."
"International Paper Announces $2 Billion Share Repurchase Program; Decreases Cash Dividend 9.8% to $1.85 per Share Annually10/12/2021MEMPHIS, Tenn., Oct. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- International Paper today announced its board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program to acquire up to $2 billion of the company's common stock. The new authorization is in addition to $1.3 billion remaining as of the end of the third quarter from a previous repurchase authorization. During the third quarter the company repurchased approximately $212 million in common stock at an average price of $59.13 per share. The company intends to continue repurchasing such shares in open market transactions. The company's board of directors also decreased the quarterly common stock dividend by $0.05 per share or 9.8%, which brings the per share dividend to $1.85 annually."
Where is the bottom? 42? 39?
"See my note on Jan 9, 2019. Downgrade IP on 1/9/19.....stock moves up 4% (in a down market) the very next day. No one will call WFC or try to hold their feet to the fire. When IP is at $60/share they will upgrade it with a $80/share price target and sell it the next day."
Tendering for their long term corporate bond debt sends a powerful message of the strength and vision of this company . BE LONG... BE PATIENT.... BE A WINNER .
bought 300 shares at 38.70. dont really see this bottoming out much lower than here. but I'm willing to buy more
Wow......sure gets quiet on this board when the stock is misbehaving. I bought more today at $44 (in the morning ....before Powell).
"Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. The upcoming fine paper spin off is most likely causing interested parties to kick the tires on fine paper assets and make offers pre-spin off. Sale of Poland mill will be bringing in over $800 million. I would not be surprised to see interest in the Brazilian assets. Hopefully there will be an offer. Also hopefully proceeds will be used to pay down debt, return value to shareholders and improve computer systems, cybersecurity and logistics. Do not want to see IP go after Domtar with the cash."
"Just watching a story on CNBC how Kroger is initiating ""Kroger Ship"" to compete with Wal-mart/Whole foods and Amazon delivery to the home. Research is saying that home food delivery goes from 2% (current) to 20% in 4-5 years. This e-commerce trend is going to GREATLY increase the number of cardboard boxes needed. Your IP shares should now be considered a ""long term"" investment and NOT a trade. GLTA"
Another solid earnings report. Packaging numbers up...printing papers would be even better if coated manufactures were not lifting coaters and making uncoated. Not sure how long that is sustainable. Pulp prices are in the toilet right now and that is basically the issue for IP. Any sustained trade aggreement shoukld help pulp and overall business.Another impairment charge for a lousy investment...good news the takeover guys ae gone.Cash generation up by over 10%. I was hoping for dividend up to $2.10...maybe being conservative due to trade issues.
"Question to holders..Seems like a nice entry with a low beta ,, Is this a good defensive proof stock with a solid dividend to gold for 5 years?"
"1/28/21, ZACKS maintains a 1- Strong Buy on IP"
"If we keep this trend for a while longer, yield will be at 100% or better!!"
I will admit that I never thought we would see these price levels again. It's as if they went through with the acquisition and got penalized for it. We did fill the last open down gap when we hit 54.34 so maybe it was that. The market hasn't had too much negativity because of the tariffs so I doubt that would result in the 10%+ decline we've had.
"This lines up more accurately with the share price action of the last year than anything else which I have seen as an explanation.....more bad news....._____________________Containerboard stocks fall after KeyBanc cuts ratings on 4 companies to underweightBY MarketWatch— 2:50 PM ET 07/15/2019Shares of containerboard companies fell Monday, after KeyBanc Capital analyst Adam Josephson turned bearish on several companies in the sector, as industry fundamentals continue to deteriorate. Shares of WestRock Co. (WRK) fell 2.7%, Sealed Air Corp. (SEE) shed 2.2%, Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) slumped 2.2% and International Paper Co. (IP) slid 1.0%. The stocks were the four-biggest decliners within the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF (XLB), which edged up 0.1%. Josephson cut his ratings on all four companies to underweight from sector weight. Although containerboard fundamentals are ""worse now than in recent years,"" Josephson said valuations are now lower than in line with historical averages. That suggests consensus estimates for the companies have further room to fall, which suggests the stocks are more likely to underperform over the next 9 to 12 months. The stocks' selloff comes as the materials ETF has climbed 15.7% year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 20.1%.-Tomi Kilgore; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com"
"just bought in, merry Christmas guys."
Pete Najarian on the Halftime show said the option traders are buying the IP $42.50 calls that expire Friday 10/25. The options traders rule the stock movements and will be right. IP will be over $42.50 (maybe today) and will significantly higher after their ER.
"OK IP shareholders , today (9/19/2018) was the day. This is the first day we closed above $54/share (closed at $54.22). Ironically before today, the last time we closed above $54/share was June 19th (exactly 90 days ago). My point is the trend change is in. I'll stay with my prior prediction of $60 by year end (see below). With the market at new highs we are not going directly to $60. It will be a choppy path there."
4.5% increasing dividend + $2 billion buyback + 6.1 P/E << ======= seems like a bargain What am I missing?
IP is up 8.23% to 35.51
... sure seems to be a good buying oppty for long term holding. Short term situation should not be forever.
"I think that they're more into real estate, ie forestry mgmt. than paper production. And with some properties having been devastated by fire, this affects the bottom line. Still, IP is up huge from the covid crash of Mar 2020."
I have just seen secret information( from very deep sources) that indicates IP stock could go up or down.
Has ANYONE received anything from IP on this? Only thing I see is that they ARE going to BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM IP! This is not anyway to keep Stockholders informed!!!
Jon Najarian bought IP today (7/17/19) at $42.45 (approximately). Let's see what happens.
"OK....so we didn't get the ""POP"" we expected. Nothing wrong with the EPS, and Revenues. Continuing to buyback shares each quarter. CEO was ""adamant"" about continuing to grow and sustain the dividend. Cash flow to grow from $1.8B in 2018 to $2B in 2019. 4.2% dividend yield, low p/e, ........hey it's a great value stock , it's not going to move +/- 20% on earnings, like a growth stock."
just bought some shares today very good company
I heard about IP the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I can't remember when Zack's was right about anything.
On World Intellectual Property Organization site:Friday afternoon and noticing that @TetraBioPharma’s composition of matter patent around inhaled cannabinoids status is now listed as “In Force ” $TBP $TBPMF #IP #cannabis #patent
"company is doing well. numbers are good, dividends are in line, balance sheet is good. this is a good long term candidate. 60$+ dividends. easy money"
"Way oversold on good earnings results. With the up-coming price increases, this should go to 70."
what's going on today.dont see any news
IP reached a new 52 Week High at 59.55
"I am a long term investor, liked the price and put a buy order at 43.50 yesterday morning. It did NOT fill in the afternoon when it hit my mark... First time I had a buy order not filled. It is unscientific, but I took it as a sign NOT to buy at this time. Heck, it's as good a reason as any for me to wait."
"Well, it looks like a big day today. IP crossed $57 and made it up to the $57.35; which is what Recognia had for a target a couple of weeks ago. IP also filled the open gap that was between $56.20 and $57.35.Trading Central is still showing a run up to $59; but I don't know if that is happening or not (honestly).I am going to wait and see what happens next."
2 billion dollar stock buy back and a divy boost to $2.00 thank you to all those selling to me :-)
Anyone see the SLVM shares in their account yet?
Earnings seemed to be good and beat analysts expectations but the stock is getting hit during the conference call. I can only guess what they are saying isn't that great. Anyone listen?
Never throught they would give me a chance to get back in IP after I sold it when it got so over valued . Just made my first purchase to built back in . If they want to take it lower that's ok it will let me buy more cheaper. IP is a great company . You just don't get to many times to get in this cheap.
The new corporate tax rate might give the dividend a bump up. Corporations don't know yet how this will increase cash flow...they only have a rough idea.
"Good quarter!! Second , third and fourth quarters are normally higher due to seasonal demand, so the runway is clear for at least a little while. I like the strong csh flow generation, make the dividend not only safe but room to increase it. Expecting similar (or better) results from Westrock (WRK) next week."
"No matter what you buy or where you buy it, it comes in some kind of packaging."
"I have, just this morning, seen information that reveals that IP is going to fall to a low of $38.50 (most likely sometime next year).If you were shopping for bargains, you might want to wait.This mess has not stopped nor figured out even HOW TO STOP.Don't worry though, your stock is great. No problems. Everything is rosy. Just the share price is always to high. Merry Christmas."
Been a long time since this has been sub 50..
"What's eating International Paper. It gained a lot of ground yesterday and Monday after a big fall off last week. Today, we're back in the tank again. The only information I see currently is the news Steinbeck gives below and the fact that they're off-loading another tranche of pension liability for the new year. Is this what's moving the price? Seems strange; I thought the pension news would be a boost for the stock even if they're looking at paying a premium to Prudential Financial. I think this is a good move on the part of IP."
This was their moment to shine... I guess it’s the increase in plastic packaging that Amazon has been using recently. Good for truck load factor but bad for the environment and IP shareholders. I might sell half my position this week... Nice divy though so idk
If you add back the Sylvamo valuation IP's technicals are starting to look better. Needs to get back over $56 and hold.
I've owned IP for 25 years and have noticed that the analyst are always backwards when they rate it. They say sell the whole time it is going up and they say buy when it's going down. I think alot of times they are using individual investors. Should be against the law.
You don't raise your dividend by 2.5% and then report poor quarterly earnings............you just don't. We will know for sure on 10/31/2019.
The search for yield is on and IP will now start getting stock buyer looking for yield. Why I am one of them. and made my first purchased today . only took 3 years for me to get back in IP after selling it when it got so very over valued. Well now it way under valued and it pays me 5% again to wait for the next run higher . Do what you want I will be buying more if they want to give it to me on even bigger sale price.
"I worked 17 years for IP, but retired now. Earnings continue to grow and last quarter they beat their earnings estimate, but stock value has dropped 10% over the last month. Looks to be in an over-sold position right now. ""Big Boys"" obviously nervous about IP's earning going forward due to the China-US trade war."
"Should be interesting in the morning. Good up day today on 133% of the average volume. A lot of volume into the close. Wonder if somebody knows something or is this just positioning (options, hedges, etc...). We will soon know."
"Excellent earnings report with strong cash generation...plus major reduction in debt. Pulp still bad, but printing papers had a decent rebound. Luckily IP is not as dependent on office papers as PKG or Domtar."
"I am just putting this ""signal change notice"" out there for posterity. I am NOT saying that they will achieve the target, and I am NOT saying that they won't. I found a change to Trading Central's signals, I am simply putting it out there. (from 07/18/18)It is STILL more important that the company ""shows it's hand"". After all of the events which have transpired, it is definitely NECESSARY.We will see just how far things get. ________________________________Technical EventOutlook - International Paper ST: short term rebound towards 56.4Short Term View: Limited Rise• • • • • Recent Technical ChangeUpgradeMedium Term View: Range• • • Recent Technical ChangeUnchangedOur pivot point stands at 50.8.Our preference: short term rebound towards 56.4.Alternative scenario: the downside breakout of 50.8 would call for 49.2 and 48.1.Comment: the RSI is below its neutrality area at 50.

Ip is worrisome- Payout ratio 126% and still receiving lots of money from sale of assets to GPI. What's going to happen when GPI pays off and ip receives no money? Goldman Sachs rates it a sell!
"Okay, we have a change which bodes well for us presently. Stockconsultant has revised long targets up as today.

"With Amazon and Wal-Mart buying cardboard boxes to ship retail, can’t see IP going anywhere but up slowly. And who cares how slow with a 5.5% div."
IP has now broken below its 200-week moving average which is a major negative sign for the shares. Looking at/around the $41.00 area for the next important support level. This level is an important retrace level on the chart and a spot where the stock broke out in July 2016.
"IP will start their buyback program this week. $2 billion, is about 11% of the outstanding shares."
"No position yet in IP, but dividend and valuation seem intriguing. However, isn’t paper a dying breed? Everything is going digital part of me feels like investing in this would be like investing in VHS tapes in the 90s... am I wrong?"
September industry numbers were the best since pandemic started. Container numbers were very strong and printing/writing is showing improvement at the same time as producers are shutting down production.
The International Paper facility reopened Wednesday morning. A representative from International Paper reported that all of the team members are safe. The fire is still under investigation. Original Story: Employees evacuated from International Paper in Lynchburg after a fire was reported at the facility.Lynchburg Fire officials told WFXR News that the fire no injuries were reported at the facility on Mayflower Drive.
"OK let's try this one more time.....On Monday 5/20 this stock falls 4% on no news. On Tuesday (the next day) it's up over 3% on no news. This is how the high frequency traders, options trades, hedgers, algo's work. It has NOTHING to do with the intrinsic value of the stock. This is why you should not try to be a trader.......you'll never get the days right. The stock trades on it's FUNDAMENTALS over the long term. The fundamentals are known on the earnings report day. The days between the earnings reports are when the day traders play. DON'T succumb to their tactics that cause WILD swings in the stock. Invest on the fundamentals and hold it until the fundamentals change. GLTA."
Earnings next week. Machines selling today. Buy backs out of the equation. Fruit shipping could be damaged by tariffs. Internet shipping demand is heaviest in third/fourth quarter. Any temporary price cut not stopping dividend payouts or buy backs. Industry has figured out how to manage supply/demand. Added to both IP and started to new West Rock position.
Excellent October numbers for containerboard. Plus operating rate was over 98% which is basically full capacity. Exports were down which helps average price.
"Okay.What a mess....... huh?IP has gone from a high of $59.57 on 06/12 to today's (thusfar) lows of $53.91.Work that out and you have a #$%$66 decline over the last 6 tradiing days (06/12 to 06/20).Or it works out to a -9.5% decline (non-Fibbonacci).Fibbonacci retracement wise, we are down WELL over 61.8%.Looking at the move down -9.5%........ technically it still holds a a ""correction"" and not a change to a bear market situation. I guess that you could call it an extreme correction. But more honestly, I admit that I am a little nervous about what we are seeing. I am hoping that IP is not going to get swept up with other stocks which are ""supposedly at risk"" of the China tariff war. I saw an article yesterday, released by TheStreet (Cramer's company) that listed 50 stocks which are suseptible of getting beat down due to the China tariff situation.I checked the list and IP was NOT on it. Today's action is troubling to me, as I cannot fine a reason for this move down. I am hoping that it is ONLY due to the lower gap-fill.My hopes are that today is the end of this down move period."
Great dividend and great 3rd quarter results. Will keep an eye on management. Really need to see some tweaks to medium range plan as Coronavirus seems to be sticking around for a while.
"Overall market surging, IP is down almost 3%. Either they are manipulating it down ahead of earnings, or earnings and or revenues will not be that good. Just have to sweat it out until they are released!!"
I am a current employee for IP and stay busy with business so idk why it has dropped like this. It really is a great company and just going to get bigger and better so I believe its undervalued really
Does anybody know if (and to what extent) IP took advantage to buy-back some stock when it got $43 and below....they have authorized a lot of money for buy-backs . JOE
"I just received an offer to either sell my 28 shares, (for an undisclosed amount), or buy an additional 72 shares for $3,744.00, ($52/share, based on a share price of $40.67 as of 9/30/19, plus fees). I think I can get them cheaper elsewhere."

This moves the target above the stock's Tuesday closing price of $57.19.The upgrade from RBC marks a return to outperform after the firm had downgraded its investment rating on International Paper's (IP) shares to sector perform in mid-April due to an ""unfavorable view of the proposed acquisition.""In confirming late Tuesday that it won't be making an offer for Smurfit Kappa Group, International Paper (IP) cited a ""lack of engagement by Smurfit Kappa's board of directors and management.""

Both proposals had been rebuffed.In its Wednesday note to clients, RBC said ""we liked IP, just not with Smurfit.""

IP is going out of business hurry sell I need to buy more shares
"The dividend is fat, but it's overlooked that IP bought back hundreds of millions in stock last year with a market cap of 18.48 billion. A gem hidden is plain sight."
"Today 11//18....Someone called in to the CNBC Halftime report and asked Jon Najarian for his thoughts on IP. He said it was a ""screaming buy"". I agree."
"Hey this market is not that interested in Packaging & Containers right now, WestRock Company beat on earnings and revenue yet it went down and is down more today. The good thing is that I have both companies in my portfolio and I keep getting the dividends. The plastics are wining today. I am a long term holder and up on both stocks over 5% which is not as important as the dividends I am collecting dividends each quarter. Good luck to all."
"I’m in! Averaged in at $34.43. I’m still looking to add a bit more, but I’m in for the long run. Planning on the nearly 6% yield to help me retire. I will reinvest the dividend for awhile."
"They must have paid the dividend, stock price is down..."
It's interesting that Zack's had this with a rating of 1 (strong buy). Then they missed the Zack's estimated earnings and now Zack's has them rated as a #2 (Buy). Trying to protect their guess.
"Fact is IP is back to growth trend if you remove the sugar high of the 2018 tax cut , Fact is IP is doing great. Time to start picking up shares on any pull packs and get paid very well to wait for the next run to new yearly highs"
Another ‘do the opposite of Cramer’ stock.
Great play on Amazon! Most of the time when my wife orders from Amazon the stamp on the back says IP
"I recently saw an interesting article written by an analyst from ""Simply Wall Street"". He makes a lot of assumptions, but his estimated valuation shows IP is currently trading at approximately a 24% discount. I agree with his analysis, but think there are many other stocks also trading at a discount from there discounted cash flow value."
"Looks like IP better start gearing up looks like we are going to need a little more boxes , WOW looks like everyone is blowing away business WOW retail is strong."
IP should buy GPK; GPK has strong earningsand a buy rating from Goldman with a new targetprice of $22. IP would be buying an addditional 85 cents in earnings.
Why is IP's Beta over 1.30? I would think it would be below 1.
"Every day all I see is Amazon, FedEx and UPS trucks delivering boxes! How can IP not be killing it? I think if they can't make money in a pandemic we need a change in management."
"Cash about $700MM, DEBTS $7BB,Way over valued"
IP's board now is the time you want to start buying back shares and retiring them Just look at the money you can save long term on the dividend payout
IP is down 4.93% to 53.06
Looks like pretty good resistance around 46-47. I may add to my recent position at those levels. Looks like info about the miss was out there several days ago!!
I believe this can be classified as a “buying opportunity”!!
"One reason I bought IP is for the dividend, and the other reason almost everything comes in a box."
Why is ip down so much today?
watch $MARA $MSTR $HIVE $DMGI $NDA $BIGG $IP
I will be taking shares on all the call options I purchase all the way out to Jan 2020's. Today if you want the dividend and keep the dividend I would buy more shares today or repurchase the call options. Fast before I start you might nort see them gone fromyour account until the close and it will be to late to save your dividend. Just a heads up
"A good solid quarter that is being reported as ""disappointing"" and a failure of management. The press certainly has its own agenda, and it isn't truth."
after getting a lot of little stuff in big boxes from amazon I thought this would be a good idea. not yet
"On November 1, 2019 IP's stock price was $44/share. That day RBC Capital analyst raised the price target for IP from $42 to $43 and kept his ""market perform"" rating. Do these guys actually get paid for these wonderful insights? One week later (Nov 8) the stock closed at $46.21."
Program Trading is the scourge of the stock market.
"In the 4th quarter Ray Dalio (Hedge Fund guru for Bridgewater) a VERY SMART INVESTOR increased his position in IP by 1.3 million shares, almost 8X what he already owned. He bought the shares at an average price of $44.18. Meanwhile .......if you remember, WFC analyst downgraded IP on January 9th when the stock was trading at $42 vs todays price of $46.50.Need I repeat.........NEVER make your trades/investments on analyst upgrades/downgrades. They are working for their investors NOT YOU and in many cases are buying when they downgrade or selling when they get the pop from an upgrade."
IP sells cartons that are used by Amazon.
"I have been looking for signals to change, and I have been watching intently for any changes; but, up to now, I haven't seen any. Since May 29th IP has moved from approximately $53 to $59 which translates to an approx. 11% move upward. If I had to assume anything, it would be that IP needs solidify that move or possibly give some amount back to establish a secure floor. Looking at resistance and support levels, it would appear easier to go up than down to me. There is a double resistance level (strength between 5 and 10) at around $59.75.But there are Triple and Double support levels which IP would find at $58.3 and $57, respectively.The 200 DMA may also provide support at $56.39.There are the possibility of open gaps down at $55.5 and $54. Those don't look likely to be achieved, to me. Unless, something big and unexpected came out, news-wise , to make those gaps a reality.My best swag at this is maybe a little down, and maybe mostly sideways movement, until IP proves ready to resume a climb. (It is almost scary, to me, how fast this wonderful stock can climb. ):-)"
We just had what they call a golden cross in the short term vs long term moving avg. Supposed to be a bullish sign . Looks like it wants to move higher.
I'm encouraged by this bounce-back. I am hoping that it means that IP still has momentum left in the bottle. It doesn't look like IP filled that lower gap in the $53 range; although it looks like it did try (very briefly) at the open.For Michael in NC===== looks like you should have gotten a very nice buy-in price last week. $55 to $65 should fetch a nice yield. Good luck. Keep going IP !!!
"Here we go again. You can do it IP! Get through this resistance level, then back to the 50’s. Wall Street hates you but I’m rooting for you."
Analysts predict earnings to stay steady in 2019. with a P/E <10 it looks pretty safe at this price level. Paying over 4% dividend it is much better than bank savings and every week holders can sell covered calls. No wonder over 1100 institutions hold this stock.
"With a 7.17 PE, 3.67 dividend yield, a growing bottom and top line, you would think this would be a great investment. IP could even become a take over company soon, but not many out there with the capital to buy them. Only company that could would be amazon since they are in the need for so many boxes. I would recommend IP does a limited amount of buy back which would help their earnings per share number."
management team needs to take some bold action. hedge funds are fleeing this stock. I think it may be time to buy if management presents a strategic plan.
"The entire packaging supplies sector is tanking. Must be thinking that with the increase in warehouse pat, Amazon to $15 an hour, retailers will go after packaging suppliers for savings and you’ll see margins shrink. That and you’re seeing cost on things like stretch film and corrugation go up but those will likely get passed on to the retailers. Buy them low and rake in the dividends."
They beat both earnings and revenue by huge due to high demand for packing boxes and printing papers.
"I wonder if we are going to get the CEO ""I am excited about the future"" speech this week? Most likely."
This happens all the time with analyst. When they say sell u should probably buy. Same thing when they say buy they are selling. Should be against the law to try and manipulate stocks and take advantage of individual investor.
It's still amazing to me that Yahoo Finance can't report ALL the news on a stock in a timely manner. Just found this today 1/6/2020 that on 12/10/2019 Goldman Sachs downgraded IP from neutral to sell and put a $40 price target on it. Meanwhile BNP upgraded IP on 12/2 to OUTPERFORM with a $53 price target. I guess we will see on January 30th who is right.
"So will we hear anything from Key Banc Capital's Adam Josephson who downgraded IP only 10 days ago???? I didn't think so, they were too busy buying IP stock for their paying customers. NEVER listen to analyst."
"My thinking is with a 3.58 yield, I am getting paid to wait."
Entire sector taking a hit today. Industry numbers just came out for third quarter and stats were disappointing. Shipments down and inventories up. Exports also up which is usually an indication domestic demand slowing.I think this is supply chain related and an over reaction. Paper and packaging is lower sector and the totem pole when trucking becomes tight. Product is a low priced bulky commodity that takes up a lot of room in a truck. Tough to compete with other industries who are willing to pay more for trucks. Plus with goods being backed up in ports there is less demand from packers who are out of goods.Unfortunately until first industry earnings report comes out later this month there is going to be pain.
I do not have much BUT if it gets back to higher 50’s I will make my 30% and ease on down the road.. I do not know what will happen to THEIR FREE stock after I sell my IP but I guess I will at that time. Does ANYONE?
Stubborn level here. Expected more after solid earnings report and positive comments from CEO going forward.
These 5 percent bumps are nice ... anyone know why ?
This stock “ll be over 55$ very soon!
Latest Announcement: $2 Billion buy back and raised dividend by 5.3% to 50 cents.
This is a solid company with decent numbers. keep accumulating if it goes down.
Should I buy WRK or IP? I have been debating for the past two weeks. It looks like IP has a management team who looks out for their investors more the WRK?
Did I hear Cramer say that the paper/board companies were trying to put thru a second price increase?
"I had been listening in on the CC. Began at 10AM and just concluded. I'm sure that a detailed transcript will materialize within the next day. Overall the CC was very positive and good, with no Facebook moments. :-)Thank God, because, my week in other places has been REALLY bad. No evil surprises (financial or otherwise), management used words and phrases such as ""well positioned"", ""firing on all cylinders""""IP employees performed very well (for the quarter)"".Outlook for the remainder of the year looks good. No analyst tantrums that I can see. If I should find more detailed description in print, I will gladly share it here. :-)I was hoping and praying that this one would not go bad. At least the whole week was not a loss for me. Go IP!"
