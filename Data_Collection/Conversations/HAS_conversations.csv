"Take advantage of this pullback to either buy more or just getting into the best company in its space. Way overdone on the downside. Good numbers, a little soft on boys toys but not by much. Buy now"
Mattel crushed earnings. HAS will as well.
Bought a little has before shipping cost and availability became a issue. Will this impact Christmas so bad that HAS price could drop a lot. Worried that this could be a big issue for HAS.
"""M S"" and BMO. Both wrong."
"Hasbro should merge with Mattel... after Mattel's bankruptcy, when the few worthwhile assets they have can be purchased for pennies on the dollar."
One mom's concern that Hasbro needs to work on their products pre-release.https://www.facebook.com/thatsinappropriateblog/videos/3644370005578024/
BOOM
Priced for a $8.50 move this week with the earnings report. Report is out and its down $6 pre-market. Hoping some value investors step in and keep it within that $8.50 range.
might be a good opportunity to get in on these price!
"Brian Goldner, CEO, has passed away. SHORT IT"
Hasbro to the moon! It will be $100 soon!
"Here's what Hasbro could be buying. What a treasure.------------------------EL SEGUNDO, Calif. , Nov. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Mattel honors Ibtihaj Muhammad , the first American Olympian to compete while wearing a hijab, as a Barbie Shero by gifting her a one-of-a-kind doll in her likeness. The doll was unveiled at the Glamour Women of the Year LIVE Summit, an annual event that gives young women the opportunity to hear from select past and present Women of the Year honorees, as well as other influential leaders from a variety of fields, in Brooklyn, NY ."
HAS reached a new 52 Week Low at 86.39
why is this up today!
haspro is a steady company with fair price and nice dividend. I'm adding more. yes.
yesterday was a buy back program buying by HAS. and now it's the real thing.
no body follows? weird. it's a good company.
85 is coming...scroll down
"The supply chain issue is old news. Soon the ships/trucks/logisitics situation will get fixed. Hasbro beat expectations in Q2 despite all that. Wages are higher, America is ready to spend for this coming holiday season with their boosted savings. The demand is strong. Love this Sept/ Oct overreaction at $90."
Great company and leadership. Some troubles now (some overblown) but will be back better than ever. Buy.
Magic the Gathering is one of if not their top money maker yet they keep putting out cards that are overpowered and need to be banned constantly now. It's gotten to the point that I really question their direction in that regard along with the pointless virtue signaling they did today. Hasbro really needs to clean house at WOTC if they wanna keep the money machine working IMO.

"Support your local Dungeon Master. Buyeth thee more Hasbro, good sirs!"
Any news recently? I am doing research and besides the FB partnership for VR I can't find anything of worth
Good buying opportunity here. It never falls much lower than 90
Anyone excited for the q4 earning?
Meanwhile Mattel has doubled down on its commitment to gay/fat toys. Great news for Hasbro!http://www.startribune.com/ken-gets-a-dad-bod-and-man-bun-as-part-of-barbie-world-makeover/429662343/
Thinking about buying. Good dividend and down a lot. Good idea to buy? Seems like in recession it may be good
Profit taking on great results - buying opportunity for the rest of us
All of you investors should be concerned about the divisive actions of this company. I cannot write the truth on here because it will be deleted. Watch PV videos for the real truth. Boycott these toys!
Loading zone HAS and BLUE APRON APRN
"HAS is a short here. For folks looking to invest in games, ATVI, EA or even TTWO are much better long-term opportunities. Digital business models are where the long term growth opportunities are...."
"Does anyone know what the ""pension settlement"" charge was? Using GAAP it seems to have wiped out most of Hasbro's profit. Is this a one-time cost related to the termination of the pension plan in 2018, or is it recurring?"
I think it went ex-dividend today. Higher.
HAS reached a 52 Week low at 81.21
Am i the only one excited about hasbro?!
Everyone figures Goldner is insider-trading... again.
#HAS Rising with good volume. Technical indicators at stoxline are looking bullish.A break of 106.54 could move it up to 124.44.
i see 77 in the future
"Should be down graded, not up graded"
I wonder if Brian took the Jab. Honest question 
Mattel get wiped out after investor day and dragged Hasbro down with it. When will Wall Street realize Mattel and Hasbro are different companies?
"The entire toy industry appear to be in trouble with competition from WalMart, Amazon and other online retailers. This in addition that kids are more and more playing on mobiles means that Haspro is in chronic long-term trouble and unless they re-invent themselves will be on their deathbed like Toys-R-Us and other retailers."
"Wow, I just started trading Hasbro today and I’m down 1.5%. Not a good start. Buying call options starting tomorrow."
I would buy HAS long strangle deep out of the money if my only my account had options trading. the $60 puts for 10 cents and the $100 for 15 cents. This thing is going to be rockin on Monday morning. Your welcome
Ouch miss
They beat estimates and did not future lower guidance.
Im shorting HAS...$89 here it comes!!!
"Mattel got slaughtered, let's hope for another great quarter for Hasbro, proving once again that no one wants fat barbies or ""gender neutral"" toys (except fat liberal feminists....Naomi, are you there?). Go Hasbro!"
We are to believe people are buying monopoly during this crises! No one plays board games anymore.
"Once the D&D movies and shows start coming out, profits will  with all the tie-in merch sales."
any truth to the rumor of a merger with Mattel? New company...hasmat 
https://discord.gg/WzmJmaF
Need a new CEO? I got it covered lol.
HAS needs to merge with MAT to invent new exciting toys for children. MAT's new dinosaur looks exciting.
I bought HAS as a Starter Stock by Motley Fool on the dip in April. Up over 15% in 5 months. I am pleased with the direction Hasbro has gone after the Toys Are Us closings. Waiting on the next dip to add shares.
Soon hasbro will have all of mattel's revenue.
"Rest In Peace Brian, you were a great CEO and you will be missed. I hope the team can make your life long dream of a entertainment giant come true."
what happened to Hasbro recently?
They need to close the gap on the chart at $120. Before year end?
This is a good idea heading into ER. Wait for pullback into 60s first.
only lost $67k so I'm not mad will break even in 2 months
Hasbro is up 5.51% to 85.72
Barron's Pump never hurts....
"Mattel eked out almost a whole nickel of EPS this quarter, so maybe Hasbro will beat as well."
"Drop by offering on 11/4, How much?"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Hard to talk about it .. but thus far due to the pandemic their monopoly game soar in sales .
"This from Zacks Equity Research:""The U.S. toy industry was dealt a death blow when the country’s largest independent toy seller, Toys ""R"" Us filed for bankruptcy last September. To add a nail in the coffin, Toys “R” US also confirmed that it is liquidating its entire U.S. operation, leaving toymakers like Hasbro, Mattel MAT and JAKK Pacific JAKK in a soup, as these used to derive a considerable portion of revenues from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. Although retailers like Amazon AMZN came to the rescue of these toymakers, the companies currently don’t have shelf spaces as big as Toys “R” Us, which remains a concern."""
GOING TO ROCK ON NEWS ON MONDAY
They're working on an animated series for Netflix for Magic: the Gathering
"Hasbro posted earnings of $1.88 per share, beating estimates of $1.63 per share."
Does anyone think this means less or even no dividend?
Hasbro is down 5.01% to 91.37
Hmmm. Not good obviously but not discouraged. As usually a long I might go shopping for more...
"Already over priced, selling starts now"
This quarter will be interesting especially since historically HAS doesn't typically preform well in Q2.Anyone want to drop thoughts on the quarter?
"lets get this this going again, it was fun to watch and now we are going sideways."
buying at 85
"I backed the truck up at $43/ share the day I saw the CEO interview on CNBC. It's now my number one holding. Great company, story, dividend, future. I'm looking for a big pop after ER. GLTA."
"File those SEC complaints online: Brian Goldner and every other officer of Hasbro exercised their options and dumped their shares on Feb 26-28. The following Tuesday the TRU liquidation was ""leaked"" to Bloomberg."
Sls Sellas Life Sciences about to 20-40x on pending FDA approval for cancer drug GPS to treat 20 different types of cancer. Company just started hiring for manufacturing on website showing their hand that they know FDA approval is on the way or they wouldn’t be hiring now. Sls already signed licensing deal in China with 3D-medicines with royalties for more than current market cap. Analyst are jumping on board and institutions buying now in front of approval . Huge short squeeze just starting as news of hiring for manufacturing and lots of other great news leaking into market for very under the radar company. Sls is the future of cancer treatment. Look into company and u will see this is all true.
They surpassed their earnings report and showed growth from last year. This is despite lockdowns halting their typical kids movies to promote their toys.
"Ok... Mattel smashed earnings expectations, and I have to think that Hasbro will do as well or better.Got In today for Mondays earnings... Hope I don't regret it.Play-Dohhhh!!!"
some news? HAS and MAT Popping
The individual or individuals who suggested the elimination of Mr.. and Mrs. Potato Head should be fired for doing extensive damage to our corporate image.Stockholders should not be tolerant of this kind of gender political nonsense.I am selling this stock because we are now facing a consumer boycott over this outrageous nonsense.
Great for a swing trade!!!
this stock is way too inflated to begin with...it should be valued at about 70-80max per stock
WOW...talk about over done on the downside. Time to buy
"I made a video about stocks to buy in Market CrashCheck it on YouTube: ""10 Stock to buy in Market Crash  Recession Proof stocks""$HAS in that list do you want to know another 9?"
down more than 6% in less than 10 mins after market opens. my goodness.
How can this stock drop after positive dividends --Fire the CEO
HAS is up 8.35% to 68.38
Mattel had another horrible quarter == good for Hasbro.
Kids bored in summer. Buy some toys!
Brian Goldner dumped $30M in shares just days before TRU announced liquidation. Maybe he's just lucky?
HAS and MAT will merge in 2018. This is a case of necessity. They need each other.
"with the DnD Resurgence, MTG Resurgence both hopefully getting TV series soon, and mtg arena success that has gotten alot of new costumers over the course of the Pandemic who are eger to try playing MTG in an LGS and buy paper decks I can see Hasbro having a killer year, Moder Horizons 2 coming out which is a super hype set. bought in today gunna continue to add, hoping for some steady growth"
He’ll always be known as Mr Potato Head!
Down 6% today while the market is up 200. Still dropping after hours. Hassenfeld's selling another million shares? Insider-trading litigation? Tariffs? Or all three?
Should we hold to Q3? Earnings surprise or not?
why is everyone selling when the company is buying another one?
"Looks like the option sellers are going to wipe out the 90's calls tomorrow. Thieves. That's why I NEVER buy calls, only sell them against my stock."
Perfect timing for release of the CRT training of employees. Won't be buying their toys for XMAS or birthday presents and plan to sell the stock.
Why does a low tech toy company sell at 59 times earnings?
"Well, “according to people familiar with the matter” MAT declined the offer. I guess those are the same people who released the rumor on the offer to begin with and sold you their shares in 20% premium. Congratulations, you fail for the oldest scam in the book."
Crazzzzzzy run up here.. wow.....
"What a shame, they should've waited until after Mattel's bankruptcy."
So if Mattel can figure out the tariff issue why can’t HAS?
Deeply oversold on the short term!
Hasbro is up 6.16% to 98.10
Short sellers got burned here today
My prediction :this is psycho stock and it will fly from now
"With reprints of MTG cards, Hasbro is basically printing money... and not just money, but $20 and $50 bills in card-form! MTG and DND are massively recognized games, likely to grow and remain in popularity perpetually. This is an odd intersection of gambling, esports, nostalgia, fantasy... and entertainment. The characters, worlds, and stories have tremendous long-term potential. I see Hasbro's DND and MTG offerings as future Star Wars / Disney-type multigenerational entertainment."
"I am surprised that the stocked reacted to the eps impact to 2020. The acq of eOne is a strategy you can best understand if you watch the episode re: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on “They Toys that Made Us” available on Netflix. Having an entertainment production company is an engine for predictable and growing toy sales. Children see toys as avatars for something they can form an emotional connection and TV provides that through the story lines and character development. Ninja Turtles was an adult graphic comic, that a toy maker wanted to bring to life, but how to introduce it to children. They created the whole cartoon to sell the action figures. May have seemed organic but was engineered demand. Same with Paw Patrol today - a cartoon that is one long ad for toys. And it works. And is not a bad show, as a parent I like it, it’s better than most teaching positivity and I don’t knock it just because it’s trying to sell toys. Point is eOne is going to supercharge and make sales more predictable based on rating and market info. I bought based on the acq and am down big in a down market and I am a hold on this. Strong conviction in the model and management was trying to explain what a jewel eOne is going to make the new Hasbro. Analysts were concerned about slowing growth, not achieving as high return on investment - these questions show that they don’t understand how the landscape works and what Hasbro is planning on a holistic level."
It's a Buy under 90....
Does hasbro know the first thing about making video games.....I see no need for Roblox partnership...It isn't needed
Yahoooooo!!! Was able to hop in when it was only $96 earlier!!!
Report is out and great! Strong balance sheet
This company cpuld go to 200 if spin off wizards of the coast
"nice breakout above resistance today, technicals look good. going to pick up calls for earnings next week."
HAS is up 6.93% to 107.89
"Does anyone know if HAS will see the profits from any possible Dungeons and Dragons movie. Im Making a call, that with the marvel universe is running out of stories it is only a matter of time before they dig up the DND novel universe and make them into movies. I see there is a partnership but how much would HAS see from movie box office sales ?"
Big drop tomorrow.
"What a great balance sheet HAS has! I'm just concerned that when people get out of quarantine, the last thing they'll want to do is stay in and play games."
Just broke through the 200 day moving average. That's big. This thing has a good chance of getting back to the $100's.
Only down 0.3% after hours. Market doesn't seem think it's much of a loss.
HAS is up 8.39% to 71.15
Longs... dont panic... this company has been around a long time and it's not going anywhere... I have to young ones and limit screen time to 30 mins a day. Guess what they play with? Toys... we played with them and so will they... keep your kids off the cell phones and I pads and let them play with real toys.
I'll have to listen to the investor presentation at toy fair from this morning. This drop is bizarre with no news.

added more to my portfolio today on the dip... next target 90
Great article out today on HAS. Higher. $100 soon.
I've been out and around trying to get summer toys i.e. water guns ect. fro my kids. You can't find any and I'm thinking there could be a surprise in earnings for the 2nd quarter quarter which is not typically strong for HAS.
Table Pounding on Sale MATTEL....at anything under $24 per share. The momentum is undeniable in the brands....and momentum breeds momentum. They are now LEADING the industry in share growth. This company is delivering in spades. Expect $37-$40 range by EOY in my opinion. They sand bagged their increase in guidance...to be so low its a joke. Lots more upsized guidance to come!
About to take off thru 80. Just went thru the 50 day moving avg.
"HAS can't go down. won't go down. it's the most valuable toy company in the world and toys are spanking valuable. markets will tumble and turn but Hasbro is fireproof and can't be burned. shorts and putters, capitulate (as I did today) and seek the solace of sunshine and pony rainbows...cause this stock isn't touching down ever again."
Toys are back in style I suppose. Pick up more today before Xmas.

Hasbro was going to buy Lionsgate for $40 a share a couple years ago. Now they could get it for $20. Why not now????????
Wow!!!
Hey fellas. Gen X investor. Raised on real toys by Hasbro. I want to invest in Hasbro. Are these recent dips good to jump on the Hasbro train? Or should I wait for a lower buy in? Thanks.
Adding on the dip
Please dump your Hasbro shares as soon as you are able.....we need to teach companies like this that indoctrinating employee's with anti-white propaganda is not okay....
Expect a rebound to $104-$105 today.
Hasbro and Mattel will merge. Just as soon as Mattel declares Chapter 11.
A racist company? Has to be if they are promoting CRT. Wouldn't wanna buy this stock now. Or their products of course.
Whats wrong with HAS?
Any predictions about earnings this quarter? Revenue was declining in most areas prior to the TRU announcement. Does anyone out there think management will be able to offer positive guidance?
"""According to BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson, there have been a number of headwinds working against Hasbro in recent quarters, none of which are likely to ease up any time soon.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-inc-stock-too-many-problems-104146557.html"
Could the drop also be due to ex dividend date rules? Therefore this stock should drop again today approximately 3.98% into the bell. Will climb after though.
good chance to add to position here! 90 is cheap
there's a pretty good short on this so if you wait you may be able to get out with a little less pain when they start to cover

"In recent years, major developments in how video games and eSports competitions are being organized have taken place, creating a new and fast-growing market. Awareness about eSports is also rapidly expanding thanks to technological advancements and higher income levels around the world. According to Grand View Research, in previous years, limited tournament infrastructure and a lower number of organizations have restricted the market growth. Such limitations resulted in fewer revenue streams for players and team owners. However, in 2017, Riot Games created the League of Legends for the North America and Europe region, giving a structured format to the tournament. Later, in 2018, Activision Blizzard, Inc. launched its Overwatch league, creating requisite infrastructure and monetization of the eSports tournaments. FansUnite Entertainment Inc.
