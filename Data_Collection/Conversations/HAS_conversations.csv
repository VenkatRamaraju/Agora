Bought a little has before shipping cost and availability became a issue. Will this impact Christmas so bad that HAS price could drop a lot. Worried that this could be a big issue for HAS.
Thinking about buying. Good dividend and down a lot. Good idea to buy? Seems like in recession it may be good
This is a slow and steady company. You wont be disappointed to hold at long term.
Bullish article by the Motely Fool this morning on HAS. Says it's undervalued and should be a core holding.
"I backed the truck up at $43/ share the day I saw the CEO interview on CNBC. It's now my number one holding. Great company, story, dividend, future. I'm looking for a big pop after ER. GLTA."
good chance to add to position here! 90 is cheap
"Hasbro news out! Good news that sale proceeds will be used to pay down debt and pay general expenses. Hasbro to focus on growth of core business. GLTA!Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Entertainment One Music (""eOne Music"") for an aggregate price of US$385 million in cash."
"I am surprised that the stocked reacted to the eps impact to 2020. The acq of eOne is a strategy you can best understand if you watch the episode re: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on “They Toys that Made Us” available on Netflix. Having an entertainment production company is an engine for predictable and growing toy sales. Children see toys as avatars for something they can form an emotional connection and TV provides that through the story lines and character development. Ninja Turtles was an adult graphic comic, that a toy maker wanted to bring to life, but how to introduce it to children. They created the whole cartoon to sell the action figures. May have seemed organic but was engineered demand. Same with Paw Patrol today - a cartoon that is one long ad for toys. And it works. And is not a bad show, as a parent I like it, it’s better than most teaching positivity and I don’t knock it just because it’s trying to sell toys. Point is eOne is going to supercharge and make sales more predictable based on rating and market info. I bought based on the acq and am down big in a down market and I am a hold on this. Strong conviction in the model and management was trying to explain what a jewel eOne is going to make the new Hasbro. Analysts were concerned about slowing growth, not achieving as high return on investment - these questions show that they don’t understand how the landscape works and what Hasbro is planning on a holistic level."
"Brian Goldner, CEO, has passed away. SHORT IT"

"The supply chain issue is old news. Soon the ships/trucks/logisitics situation will get fixed. Hasbro beat expectations in Q2 despite all that. Wages are higher, America is ready to spend for this coming holiday season with their boosted savings. The demand is strong. Love this Sept/ Oct overreaction at $90."
"With reprints of MTG cards, Hasbro is basically printing money... and not just money, but $20 and $50 bills in card-form! MTG and DND are massively recognized games, likely to grow and remain in popularity perpetually. This is an odd intersection of gambling, esports, nostalgia, fantasy... and entertainment. The characters, worlds, and stories have tremendous long-term potential. I see Hasbro's DND and MTG offerings as future Star Wars / Disney-type multigenerational entertainment."
Only down 0.3% after hours. Market doesn't seem think it's much of a loss.
"Just remember, alot of 'oil' goes into their products."
"Rest In Peace Brian, you were a great CEO and you will be missed. I hope the team can make your life long dream of a entertainment giant come true."

They surpassed their earnings report and showed growth from last year. This is despite lockdowns halting their typical kids movies to promote their toys.
I will wait until they warn on supply chain issues and then swoop in an buy!
