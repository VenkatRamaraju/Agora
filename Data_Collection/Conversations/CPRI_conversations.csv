"Opinion on what happened today in CPRI (intraday low of $5), since it ties in to something larger. One of the currently running crises (alongside corporate bonds, corporate paper, treasury liquidity... etc) is that there are many ""liquid"" mixed asset vehicles that are frozen up. For example, even big vehicles like the Vanguard Total Bond fund are trading nearly 10% under the sum total of their underlying asset value. This is because when the dealer attempts to buy the vehicle, part it out, and pocket the spread, they are finding that there is no liquidity available for many of the components. They are not actually liquid now, if they ever truly were, but this was the promise told to buyers of the vehicle/ETF. This is primarily because there is a general liquidity crisis, but also because it is extremely difficult to price corona risk (usually dynamic pricing is done by models that can't price the current environment). Even if the vehicle is composed of many similar assets, ex: high grade restaurant bonds, this current situation means that some restaurants are fully closed for months, while others will be open doing large amounts of take-out and will feel only part of the impact. The quality components are being crushed and dragged down by the toxic assets until everything can be properly repriced.This mostly concerned the insanity in some REITs today, but it must also apply to CPRI to some degree. CPRI is held in many vehicles alongside other distressed retail. Some of which is in a better situation than CPRI, some worse. Some with valuable assets like Versace, some with brands worth no more than the now empty mall storefront signage they are printed on. In the REIT space you saw strong balance sheet companies like VTR hit 13 today - priced at bankruptcy. Mark this post for the future, today was a truly legendary panic."
"No dividend, no floor price for Capri. Had a fantastic rise like most luxury houses but like Prada the slide is quick. To prioritise a share buy back over a dividend tells you that the now chairman is looking at his own bank account. Did very well with his backer first time round. Looking at the Kors cash cow we've got a board that has their noses well in the trough. Choo is a drag on Capri, Versace has to deliver every quarter to stop the fall to pre-pandemic prices."
"Maurox, private equity will take out the entire American fashion industry, they are driving prices down with the assistance of the brokerage houses. They will combine different elements of different companies and hold them for two years and then reintroduce them to the markets as IPOs with a price point of 50 for the new Capri which will not include Versace, Versace will be sold off to LVMH for a billion to raise additional cash for the deal."
Capri is up 6.14% to 60.54
"Continued insider buying today, 06/04/19, as CEO?COO Thomas Edwards Jr. picks up 11,600 shares at $34.41. Very Bullish signals from those who have the inside track on the Company's business prospect. Time to get long!."
"Thinking the Chinese attack on their own form of 'capitalism"" is /will effect high end fashion sales. Thoughts?"
"in 4 days the ER , what do guys think? i think shes gonna keep grow in asia , but in EUROPE the stores are keep getting close now the question is if the market is gonna love the report or not"
"This is one of the most frustrating stocks there is. Unreal action at 9x this fiscal years earnings, and 8x next yearâ€™s earnings.... 25% discount multiple to $RL, $PVH, Prada in HK trading. Different animal in LVMH, but a 70% multiple discount to them too.... just nuts. Staying long and strong until $75+ later this year with Versace integration and synergies"
Latest outlook they raise guidance .. This is 100 bucks stocks given its earnings capacity !! MK Versace and Jimmy choo !!!
"Guess what Oscar, it didn't fell (sic) to twenty yet, nor will it, this is freight train to the 50's and eventually to the 70's and higher."
why is it dropping AH?
Tomorrow we start trending up.
"1) off load Jimmy Choo to a European luxury house, stick to Kors & Versace2) cull the wasteful share buy-back3) start paying a dividend, ipo was a decade ago4) concentrate on your cash cow in Kors and forget talk about being an LVMH or Kering"
Capri is down 5.69% to 54.56
Amazing earnings! I feel this is going much higher!
The business getting a lot of traction!! Soon Blue Sky !! As we head to 70 bucks !!
"Shaggy, at a market of 3.85B it seems to me that the street is valuing MK at 1.85B and the two brands at 1B each -- MK by itself is probably worth around 5B -- This trading action defies any logic..."
"AI, I think if anyone makes a move, I think it is more than just a small move, I see CPRI acquisition as a small move, what I envision is a complete take over of the American fashion scene, with yesterday's losses, the top six fashion houses in USA can be bought at current prices of 36 billion, add a 25% premium, you get 45 billion, 18 months ago, those six fashion houses were worth over 2.5 times that amount. I would think a well financed private equity firm would be most probably as they could see large profits by spinning off three fashion houses by mixing and matching parts of the six and selling them off as IPOs in probably less than three years. My guess on profitability of such a move, would be in the 200% range or 67% per year. The same thing could very well happen in the brick and mortar sector of retail."
"To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
The board has stated that it constantly looks at ways to deliver value to shareholders and a share buy-back was seen as best value for shareholders. Although the board has never paid a dividend to shareholders since the 2012 IPO it commenced the buy-back in March. Share price support is yet to show through as shareholders watch to see how the circa $350m is filtered into the market. High 'beta' and the re-opening trade over shareholders can't rely on a dividend setting floor price. LVMH saw a circa 6% rise off improved Q3 with a small pull-back. With CPRI being outside of the luxury heavyweights expect to see small rise at Q3 then slide as Q4 underperforms (as per industry) when the market will realise that Q4 growth happened in Q2&3. Choo compared to Ferragamo lacks that spark and still runs at a loss post acquisition. Similar story as Mulberry as the shine wears off. Fascinating to think a board can not pay a dividend for near on 10 years but feel a share buy-back is returning cash to shareholders.
