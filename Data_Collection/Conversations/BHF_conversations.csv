I don't understand their financial reporting. Are they truly making huge profits or is this just an accounting trick?
Beat on revenue and non gaap. Massive loss on gaap earnings?
This should appreciate by 5x over the next 5 years as long as buybacks resume while price is still cheap. 2 insurance companies bought at book value this week. Be patient and wait for the dividend.
Down 7% on 300k volume? Really? How does roughly $10 million in shares traded effect $300 million in market cap? I hope it is just as effected on low volume on the way up!
"They made more repurchases in 1st quarter than they planned for whole 2020. So even thought it's temporarily suspended, they plan to resume it by year's end.https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/07/brighthouse-financial-inc-bhf-q2-2020-earnings-cal.aspx"
I have seen analyst estimates for dividend. 10 cents a year in 2020 and 36 cents a year in 2021. Would be a start
Where is the bottom? Any guesses.
"What is really amazing or telling is that there have been zero insider purchases even as ""cheap"" as this stock appears to be."
I had hoped the stock would increase due to the Price/Book ratio. Not to be as GAAP Earnings are terrible. How long will it be before GAAP and non GAAP are the same?
This stock looks like an absolute powerhouse from a technical viewpoint:Book value = 194.48Cash on hand covers their debt by 2xIncreasing revenueShareholder equity is 5x the market capFree cashflow is $36Bookprice steadily increasingPeg ratio = .04The only problem I could find with this thing is that the free cashflow is slowly decreasing each quarter.I'll do some comparing of this stock to the industry and dig deeper into their SEC filings. This is very weird.
"Curiosity: Here we have a $35 stock with a 2021 P/E of 3 based on estimates of $11.55 eps and the board can't even raise a bored ""Ho Hum"" ! Why? I'm accumulating shares off $1 to $2 swings. I'm doing the same thing with UNM and FHN. The money is in the zig zags, not in the buy and hold!"
Buybacks resume 8/24/20.
The fact that very few people here are posting means that bhf is still under appreciated and un-discovered. With just a modest increase in the 10 year treasury rate bhf should have no problem hitting 60 to 70 soon.
Bought in some eod.Credit agency report in the afternoon moved the stock higher during the day.
at some point this has to turn into a buy but man this thing just keeps dropping
In the zacks article about the earnings report they mention 4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. So that is basically the market cap? Book value per share is $125. So shouldn't the share price be much higher? What am I missing?
Negative RE second quarter in a row. What is the end game for the hedging program?
"Anyone care to guess what the earnings report means, exactly?"
Could this company actually implode if the market continues its sell off?
got the letter to sell my huge stake (6 shares) in BHF - anyone know the sell price????
