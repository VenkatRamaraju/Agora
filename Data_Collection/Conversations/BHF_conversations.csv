BHF is down -4.91% to 64.15
Is there a dividend in the near future?
This is becoming a total disaster. Down 3.5% on no volume.

This stock looks like an absolute powerhouse from a technical viewpoint:Book value = 194.48Cash on hand covers their debt by 2xIncreasing revenueShareholder equity is 5x the market capFree cashflow is $36Bookprice steadily increasingPeg ratio = .04The only problem I could find with this thing is that the free cashflow is slowly decreasing each quarter.I'll do some comparing of this stock to the industry and dig deeper into their SEC filings. This is very weird.
earnings 2.45 verses expected 2.15. looks like huge upside Potential
I had hoped the stock would increase due to the Price/Book ratio. Not to be as GAAP Earnings are terrible. How long will it be before GAAP and non GAAP are the same?

Forward pe of 4.2 is just too low. Maybe a dividend would help

I am impatiently waiting for the beginning of dividends. Does anyone have an indication of when this might happen? The EPS is a high number indicating a P/E of around 5-6. Too much debt?

"What is really amazing or telling is that there have been zero insider purchases even as ""cheap"" as this stock appears to be."
In the zacks article about the earnings report they mention 4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. So that is basically the market cap? Book value per share is $125. So shouldn't the share price be much higher? What am I missing?

"Metlife should buy this thing back. The stock has gone from $67 to $41. They should pat themselves on the back for shorting at the right time and buy back the company at 60 cents on the dollar. Or, you would think there are other life companies out there that might want to buy things at a big discount to book value."

Bought in some eod.Credit agency report in the afternoon moved the stock higher during the day.
CFO hired from MetLife. Guy was previously the Treasurer there. Why would the guy leave a nice safe place like MetLife for the supposed “bad bank” that was spun out/sold by MetLife.
$1 from 34 resistance. Should be past that by Friday as long as volume stays strong and be close to 40 by end of next week
huge jump option calls this AM
BHF should be higher in coming months. Way below book value!
Was guidance up or down i was unable to listen to call
I am buying
Terrible company. earnings should be forecastable to within a penny a share and they can't seem to predict tomorrow even after laying off hundreds of employees.
Why do you think this hot mess was spun off? Because MetLife knew what a bottomless garbage pit it was.
what a dog!!!!! this is dead money.. the problem is it's boring!!!! what else could it be.. pathetic..in at 28.. bailing out at 25 support

"Not sure why the hatred for life companies (and anything financial).

The fact that very few people here are posting means that bhf is still under appreciated and un-discovered. With just a modest increase in the 10 year treasury rate bhf should have no problem hitting 60 to 70 soon.
Looks like a good earnings report.

"Repurchases roughly 125 million worth a stock per quarter (1.5 billion over 3 years). They’ll restart repurchase program next week to stay on track as they have purchased 316 through 7 months. Roughly 1.5 billion of capital in the holding company which they have stated they only want to keep 2x fixed charges ($500 million roughly). Adding preferred to lower hedging costs. If this was dividend rather than buybacks at $500 million/year, a 5% dividend yield would make this a $10 billion dollar company. That’ll happen after they lower the share count substantially. It’ll be added to S&P500 and by then you’ll be lying on a beach in Mexico. 3 bagger conservatively from here, but could be 5-10 bagger if they continue buying back shares at steep discount to intrinsic value. Look at insider purchases and lack of selling. You’re welcome."
I don't understand their financial reporting. Are they truly making huge profits or is this just an accounting trick?

This company is missing estimates almost every quarter-- and missing estimates by huge amounts. Analysts are again lowering estimates. Probably in a few weeks we will again find that BHF is today overvalued.

Cannot comment on the BHF Stock but can comment on their lousy Customer Service. Just do a search on Brighthouse financial Service complaints. That says it all. Brighthouse giving salaries to Reps who are either clowns or have no idea what to do. Numerous transfers from rep to another and hours wasted. Multiply that by thousands of frustrated customers.BH stopped paying the monthly Annuity which I am owed according to the contract they signed. Even their reps cannot figure what is wrong and they agree with me. Next stop will be with my Attorney with my contract in hand
