"Dyadic Announces Scientific Achievements Reported During ZAPI Stakeholders Virtual Web MeetingResults demonstrate that Dyadic?s C1 platform produced record levels of safe and effective vaccines in animal trials and further positions C1 products for potential human clinical trialsJUPITER, Fla., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dyadic International, Inc. (?Dyadic?, ?we?, ?us?, ?our?, or the ?Company?) (NASDAQ: DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving, applying and deploying its proprietary C1-cell protein production platform to accelerate development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales, today is updating the market on the Company?s key scientific achievements reported in the Zoonotic Anticipation and Preparedness Initiative (ZAPI) Final Stakeholders Virtual Web Meeting, which was held on February 4-5, 2021.ZAPI was a five-year research and development program sponsored by the European Union. Dyadic and its C1-cells played a key role in the #$%$20 million ZAPI program since its launch in 2015. ZAPI brought together experts in human and animal health to create new platforms and technologies that will facilitate a fast, coordinated, and practical response to new infectious diseases as soon as they emerge.Dyadic?s patented and proprietary C1 gene expression and recombinant protein production platform was selected by ZAPI as a production host of antigens for the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV). The SBV antigen from C1 produced 300 times greater yields than the SBV antigen from baculovirus and was more stable. Additionally, the C1 SBV antigen was shown to be safe and very effective (Full Protection) in protecting cattle and mice from the SBV. Based on these results, additional fully funded animal trials are continuing in 2021 with C1 expressed antigens for SBV and RVFV and to generate additional safety and efficacy data.Several positive outcomes have already originated from the ZAPI results, including several fully funded animal health projects and several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine collaborations, including Dyadic?s receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This vaccine candidate is being developed in various collaborations, including with three of the top infectious disease and coronavirus scientists who worked with Dyadic and C1 in the ZAPI consortium, the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) and others. These activities have positioned Dyadic to determine the best path forward for an anticipated first in kind human Phase 1 clinical program using the C1 produced RBD COVID-19 vaccine candidate.?Our participation in the ZAPI project has generated important safety and efficacy data as well as demonstrating very high antigen productivity. This data, along with other data generated outside of the ZAPI program, will allow us to apply our C1 technology in ways that we, and a growing number of scientists globally, believe can help industry and governments in the fight against existing and new infectious diseases as soon as they emerge,? said Mark Emalfarb, Dyadic's President and Chief Executive Officer.?Now that we have demonstrated C1?s performance and productivity benefits compared to other cell lines, we are engaged in discussions with global scientists, biotech and pharmaceutical companies as well as governmental agencies to explore other possible vaccine and drug applications for use in human and animal health,? continued Mr. Emalfarb. ?We look forward to potentially undertaking multiple IND enabling studies to allow us, and our collaborators, to enter the clinic with a number of recombinant protein vaccines and drugs.?During the conference, ZAPI scientists highlighted the pivotal role Dyadic?s C1 technology platform played in the ZAPI project. ?Efficient manufacturing processes are being developed and I specifically would like to mention Dyadic?s C1 fungal process which gives enormous amounts of antigens and I think especially in the face of the world?s situation with the pandemic, a system where you can produce much more vaccine would be an ideal one to look into so if that were to be the only spin-off, that would be fantastic.? stated Dr. Albert Osterhaus, Erasmus Medical Centre the ZAPI managing member.Dyadic?s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Ronen Tchelet commented, ?Our participation in the ZAPI program helped us accelerate the development of our C1 gene expression platform to rapidly develop and manufacture recombinant protein vaccines, at flexible commercial scales, faster, and more affordably than other traditional vaccine manufacturing processes, such as insect cells (baculovirus). The C1 platform has proven it is capable of producing safe and effective antigens in quantities that can help combat pandemics more affordably. The hyper-productivity data generated in the ZAPI project, along with the recent productivity demonstrated"

"IIBR in animal trials, big newshttps://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/31/world/middleeast/31reuters-health-coronavirus-israel-tests.html"
"DYAI - just to make it clear, since there seem to be some haters or short traders here, who clearly need some clarification:1) Mark never said explicitly that C1 will produce 1B Doses of vaccine. But it is possible. And it's most likely faster (than CHO, E-coli and yeast), cheaper (than CHO for sure) and more stable (altogether). They proved it. Any other assumptions were made by Fox moderators who clearly have no clue.2) DYAI has been around for a while, mostly getting money for research. Well, yeah: They started with the pharma-branch 5 years ago. In the meanwhile they couldn't make any move due to some legal issues that have nothing to do with the science.3) Yeap, it seems PFE und MRNA won the race for Covid. But it's a different technology than C1. Go ask the big pharma why they wouldn't listen to DYAI. Besides, who's gonna vaccinate in India, China, South America, Africa? mRNA? No one can afford there even a 10$ pop. 4) Yes, it's a tiny company. 6 people cannot produce anything. But! C1 ist a platform that can be used easily by any person who's willing to pay royalties/license. Again, Mark is not going to produce anything. Go ask the big pharma why they wouldn't listen to DYAI. 5) So the company is young (in pharma-terms) and is trying to convince the big fish out there to go for C1. Why nothing has happend? My guess is politics. It's probably hard for the Production-Officers to admit that their science is inferior. So they keep on wasting billions. That is why I am here for the long. It's the science that seems to work. Everything else is just background noise."

"Over 34 million shares was shorted last week, over 4.2 millions shares short volume today. Only 9 million shares floating shares, this is a very good proof of Naked ShortsHold on to your shares, massive short squeeze is coming."
"We see over $6 today.. Facts! The bears will try to short the run up from yesterday now to.right out of the gate. And, this not a premarket mover, But, we will squeeze them out in the morning and early-afternoon session . The shorts covering will make this RUN today even more parabolic!! 6's-mid 6's here we come!!"
Bullish ...
A’H’s $$ - DYAI - just like moderna started hold one year $100 dollars a share￼￼￼

"This runs and runs HARD Monday Tuesday Or Wednesday maybe all three! But one, maybe a combo of the 3 will produce 35-65% We had MONSTER inside and BIG Investor buys!! Today we went RED to GREEN 3 times intraday, and we finished Red to GREEN in AH while climbing over 3.5% from close to get there!!!This weekend y'all, EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY FOR MONDAY WE FLY!!!!"
Mark CEO says DYAI is agnostic about which company develops a viable vaccine. DYAI will help make colossal scale possible. Case uptick in Beijing on news this morn. Stay long here! Looks like Moderna is working w Israel as an FYI.
Stunned how few in msg boards paying attention here and also SOLI and REGN and SNY. One day jaws will drop that they missed out on DYAI.

I just did a little dance... :-)
POTUS to and task force to update. Assume fast track and right to try type strategy from Gov’t. High five
"Am I seeing this correctly, DYAI only has like a 9M float? Wow."
"This Company is a new gene expression platform, when it is incorporated a existing or new product it will restate the market and replace current technology (CHO). This next generation platform has significant potential as it can be used in multiple applications of human and animal biologics for the discovery, development and production of drugs, antibodies, vaccines and media."
Only about 27 million shares outstanding! This is a tiny company and could rise very quickly and to surprising levels if some substantial long money tries to get in! IMHO

Chart looks good! I would buy DYAI now before it is $7 or $8 per share!
"Yesterday’s PR is a breakthrough for the Company, thought leaders in a public forum discussing the performance and potential of the C1 Gene expression platform"
They have very good news this morning
what happened today? why the big spike and then drop ? I did see the CEO on Fox Business

Blas is correct...confirmed through Fidelity. This morning upgrade with a $10 price evaluation!
Posting freeze? Why is this happening!
"Bought another 1400 shares today, thanks for the sale shorts!"
"I've read the entire transcript word for word. Quite impressive . They really have their things in order especially for the very near future! A beat of over 70% of the consensus for Revenue is remarkable as are their Sales. EPS was their ONLY downside of a quarter gone, but on the heels of a VERY promising future quarter ahead. PT needs to be set at $10.00. And that is being modest! I predict VERY frequent PR's in the VERY near future on the closing of the BINDING deal with Sorrento.(among other things) Which will sky rocket the stock price. Each PR drop on its inevitable advancements, will lead us further toward the modest $10.00 PT I mentioned earlier."
"Everyone that can, buy at least 100 shares each. Let's get some pre market buys coming in!!! Create momentumn and see if it will catch fire. If it does, the shorts will cover and their buys that they will make as they're squeezed out will send this through the roof. Then we trend get volume and go on to$ 6.00 and beyond. But, we need early buys even if they're small and then stay consistent at slapping that ask!! For anotherhundred or more especially around the VWAP intradaday! We are only talking $400-500 per person, but this will collectively squeeze out the Bears.Let's Rally!!!!!"
maybe folks should take a look at the big investors in this stock over 24% held by institutions.
"In the stance to run. Let’s go 8 billion vaccine capacity catalyst, DYAI!"
"In Fox News saw that of the recent $8+ BN funding that $3 BN going towards vaccines. Yes, the vaccine companies and test kit companies are up and I hope they all figure this out for the world quick. DYADIC International out of FL is the holding company working on the vaccine being developed in Israel. $DYAI on the NASDAQ. Go on DYADIC International website. They perhaps could be first with a vaccine but I am invested in almost all of them. And the treatments we have for now that are being used in studies and compassionate use drug."
Yikes. Good luck and best wishes!
Ready to break thru to another high IMHO
"Stumbled upon this new video. Mostly known facts...but:- Mark repeats: with IIBR they were able to produce ""massive amounts"" and ""extremely high levels"" of the vaccine and that it can be produce on a global scale ""billions of doses"" monthly- he really believes that C1 is at the right point of time in history (Covid-wise) and that they already ""deliver""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gGbGu2sm1g"

Interested investors and industry partners may request a one-on-one meeting at jlatiuk@dyadic.com or contact Dyadic at (561) 743-8333. If you are registered for any of the events, you can also request a meeting through the event platform.About Dyadic International, Inc.Dyadic International, Inc. is a global biotechnology company which is developing what it believes will be a potentially significant biopharmaceutical protein productionplatform based on the fungus Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila), named C1. The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines and drugs, such as virus like particles (VLPs) and antigens, monoclonal antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, Fc-Fusion proteins, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Certain other research activities are ongoing which include the exploration of using C1 to develop and produce certain metabolites and other biologic products. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of these technologies in development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic vaccines, drugs and other biologic products to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers, and improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.Please visit Dyadic's website at http://www.dyadic.com/ for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic's plans for its biopharmaceutical business.Contact:Dyadic International, Inc.Mark Emalfarb, CEOPhone: (561) 743-8333Email: memalfarb@dyadic.comSOURCE: Dyadic International, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/629688/Dyadic-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Events"
All you need to know about the investment is in the youtube video below.
C1 platform successfully proven to grow stronger faster cannibus plants. Should cause DYAI to go through the roof. Buy as much as you can before the announcement
I can NOT wait for this to take a huge run
Dyadic has an expression platform that can produce molecules at mass scale and at lower cost utilizing existing pharma infrastructure at CDMO’s and CMO’s. Company does not need to build infrastructure and capex
"They've gotten 10 million up front. They will get an additional 33 million also, at closing! ALONG with ROYALTIES.!!! This Vaccine will produce revenue forever for them!!The other amazing news, is that it is being proven effective on the ""variants"" of covid which is like making a vaccine for the future!! And, Sorrento will market it to Asia and Europe where those previously vaccinated will need a booster or to chooes a ""different Vaccine"" that does more for the VARIANTS (those countries don't care about FDA from America they know the various and many harmful things the FDA has approved . I believe this ""protein based"" will get EUA as well as being safer and more effective. This will help on all those that still have not been vaccinated yet by BIG PHARMA (Pfizer J&J Moderna) ASIA Is a MASSIVELY Populated Continent!! And they have said that India will be one of their main countries many among other to market it to. And yes this does include the U.S.!Can you say WOW!!!!"
I have invested in Sorrento for over a year now and so far I know CEO Dr.Ji He likes to buy this small companies as subsidiaries. I would not be surprised if he purchased this one very soon. So make a most of it and buy as much as you can.
The earning were already priced in Boom
Dyai looks like it's taking off. I see it at $9.80 before the end of the year.
"WOW!!! (2) nearly 50k share buys with in 20 mins of each other!! Not to mention 68k to start the morning run, after the weak, uniformed turned loose their shares. MAN this thing is about to EXPLODE!!!"
D J starts with a 14 targethttps://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/904761/dawson-james-securities-initiates-coverage-on-dyadic-international-with-a-buy-rating-904761.html
"My daily chart is showing me that at exactly 3pm, 784.96k share short was covered/bought with one another right behind it? Anyone else see this? That us over 3/4 of a million. That is hedgies pulling out. This is a great sign that BIG Shorts arepulling out! Once they do, and cause the parabolic run..We are home free. That cover right there is an enormous sign of great things to come. Hang tight! This is a ticking time Bomb ."
Simply ￼Buy & hold DYAI reminds me of MRNA 1-1/2 years ago
Shorts bite us! Just hold!!

"Nothing has happened with Big Pharma and this company because they dont think this is worth anything. Politics have nothing to do with it. Big Pharma is very smart.. They will gobble up any and all good technology and if this 6 person company had anything of value, they would have just bought them out.. So, we are to believe that there is an Edison type inventor among these 6 people? I don't think so! The volume is minimal.. There is no interest.. this will drift down.. as people try to slowly unload!"
"Earnings Call:The usual...many irons in the fire, there could even be a deal in 2021. News... was that Serum Institute in India collaboration seems to be in stall mode...if it still exists at all. 50/50 this goes to under $3 (no deal), or jumps to $10 (a deal signed)...and probably somewhere in the middle: $7, once dosing gets significantly under way, by early fall. Short position will keep increasing here.There's a 2 Year survival clock here, and its ticking down on Mark E."
"Bought 2000 shares today, I also owned 14k shares SRNE."
"Don’t understand why there is selling, unless shorter’s back at it! Company is very close, buy meaningful dips and hold. Long time holder and very positive on technology!"
THIS COULD MOVE DYAI TOMORROW !Early this week I called TD Ameritrade as to why DYAI was a CASH ONLY stock with no margin. I ended up burning up a lot of my cash to buy the stock anyway. Today after the close I suddenly got a big increase in B/P and I didn't know why. Finally I looked at DYAI and it was changed from non-margin to margin after todays close.My point is TD made the stock a lot more easy to buy more than twice as many shares for less cash. I don't know how many other brokers don't margin DYAI but TD is a very big firm and might make a difference in the PPS price with the increase in volume. I know I'am going to buy more with the extra B/PGOOL LUCK LONGS !
"ZAPI...The team is also exploring the potential of a prolific fungus, developed by another project partner, Dyadic, that can churn out vaccine and antibodies in unprecedented amounts and could further accelerate the manufacturing process."
"Panic selling after a little price manipulation. they need sellers on this LOW FLOAT! it will run again and hard too. And, I say between Monday and Wednesday we see a 35%-65% Green day!"
"Weakness on volume. $3.40. Odds of <$3.00 goes from 50/50 to 60/40. If market softens for real, we go <$2.50. We need a deal very, very badly for sake of share price. Company has cash to keep on trucking through 2023."
"Bears will burn tomorrow!! People can read We aren't dumb. This was a Great ER!, beside the EPS miss from a quarter that doesn't even matter with all things considered and at what's on the table currently!! We had amazing numbers in Revenue and in Sales!! And, we have a new product Covid Vaccine READY with a new Biding deal with Sorrento to market it. This pull back is where people enter at a great price for tomorrow we fly!!"

"@PATC I saw your post on ARWR's board. Have you been to the StockTwits board for DYAI it has some amazing posters.I stopped posting on ST as I have found it to be even worse than YMB although the DYAI board is loaded with great people. By the way there are only 325 watchers on the ST board for DYAI and that points to lots of upside as more discover it.I found this sometime ago from Dan at Tailwinds and liked the fact that they had lots of cash and science that was proven with the division they sold. I have averaged up with two more buys as more news percolates. The news the other day coupled with the fact they have > 100 confidentiality Agreements & MTA’s!Myself I have learned patience is key to these smaller developing plays and you have to learn or try to learn the science and most important is management as many of these micro caps have poor mngt. DYAI mngt started the co and owns > 30% and have proven themselves already.This statement from co sums up why I think they will make a big move in 2020.""Now let me add some more color to that. I think that our pipeline is bulging at the moment to some degree. Now whether these get through legal departments. We have a variety of stages of where we're negotiating potential deals as we speak today, all the way to starting new deals. And a lot of those are with Big Pharma and some of those are with biotech. Some are in animal health. Some are in human health. Some of those are with CDMOs that are contract manufacturers that a lot of these pharma companies are saying, ""Well, find us a CDMO that will run C1."" And we -- that will even accelerate things faster. So we just say stay tuned, but yes, we expect more deals to be done and we expect at least 1 or 2, maybe more, even in Q2 to be announced.”By the way I am looking at SOLY and VBIV now as cheap plays with lots of potential upside.If you like micro caps and like recurring revenue tech SaaS models check out MCLDF mCloud Technologies, this is a slow and steady growing co with an ever expanding TAM and fortune 50 clients including BAC, Starbucks, DairyQueen and many more. Sales growing rapidly and no one knows about them yet and all for only .34 per share.My take is hold a few stocks but buy a lot of shares over time and average up as news gets better and the investment theses plays out and always be on the look out for short term trades with minimum downside and good upside ( PERI at 5 and under ). All this while looking for the next one. DYAI is emerging as the next one for me now. Good luck all!"

"Look at the charts.. This is headed back down to $1.50 - they have no products. No orders.

News update today
"The Company has make significant advancements in science with successful results in mAb, Antigen and vaccine expression suggesting that most if not all roads to commercialization of Covid-19 therapies will pass through Dyadic C1 technology due to exceptional yield, potency/titer and cost advantages. The Company has established numerous development partners which means the probability of success is dramatically higher than 6 or 12 or 18 months ago and accelerating! I’m very bullish the Company will have several monetization events in the near term. Share price s/b above $10-11 today so room to run!"

"With several major drug companies working to produce a COVID 19 vaccine, two vaccines virtually FDA approved and others (JNJ) in stage three trials, would there EVER be a better opportunity for Dyadic’s technology to be used to help produce at least one of these company’s vaccine? I continue to hear only the sound of crickets. No positive announcement regarding C-1 in commercial COVID vaccine production.
