"Nothing has happened with Big Pharma and this company because they dont think this is worth anything. Politics have nothing to do with it. Big Pharma is very smart.. They will gobble up any and all good technology and if this 6 person company had anything of value, they would have just bought them out.. So, we are to believe that there is an Edison type inventor among these 6 people? I don't think so! The volume is minimal.. There is no interest.. this will drift down.. as people try to slowly unload!"

"@PATC I saw your post on ARWR's board. Have you been to the StockTwits board for DYAI it has some amazing posters.I stopped posting on ST as I have found it to be even worse than YMB although the DYAI board is loaded with great people. By the way there are only 325 watchers on the ST board for DYAI and that points to lots of upside as more discover it.I found this sometime ago from Dan at Tailwinds and liked the fact that they had lots of cash and science that was proven with the division they sold. I have averaged up with two more buys as more news percolates. The news the other day coupled with the fact they have > 100 confidentiality Agreements & MTA’s!Myself I have learned patience is key to these smaller developing plays and you have to learn or try to learn the science and most important is management as many of these micro caps have poor mngt. DYAI mngt started the co and owns > 30% and have proven themselves already.This statement from co sums up why I think they will make a big move in 2020.""Now let me add some more color to that. I think that our pipeline is bulging at the moment to some degree. Now whether these get through legal departments. We have a variety of stages of where we're negotiating potential deals as we speak today, all the way to starting new deals. And a lot of those are with Big Pharma and some of those are with biotech. Some are in animal health. Some are in human health. Some of those are with CDMOs that are contract manufacturers that a lot of these pharma companies are saying, ""Well, find us a CDMO that will run C1."" And we -- that will even accelerate things faster. So we just say stay tuned, but yes, we expect more deals to be done and we expect at least 1 or 2, maybe more, even in Q2 to be announced.”By the way I am looking at SOLY and VBIV now as cheap plays with lots of potential upside.If you like micro caps and like recurring revenue tech SaaS models check out MCLDF mCloud Technologies, this is a slow and steady growing co with an ever expanding TAM and fortune 50 clients including BAC, Starbucks, DairyQueen and many more. Sales growing rapidly and no one knows about them yet and all for only .34 per share.My take is hold a few stocks but buy a lot of shares over time and average up as news gets better and the investment theses plays out and always be on the look out for short term trades with minimum downside and good upside ( PERI at 5 and under ). All this while looking for the next one. DYAI is emerging as the next one for me now. Good luck all!"

Srne isn't moving up? Why?
"Bears will burn tomorrow!! People can read We aren't dumb. This was a Great ER!, beside the EPS miss from a quarter that doesn't even matter with all things considered and at what's on the table currently!! We had amazing numbers in Revenue and in Sales!! And, we have a new product Covid Vaccine READY with a new Biding deal with Sorrento to market it. This pull back is where people enter at a great price for tomorrow we fly!!"
"Shorting, bashong, then panic selling, people saying it's "" done"" etc.. is all to be expected. Know what you hold!! Buy more at these lows if you can, but know that a PR about the closing of the BINDING deal with Sorrento is coming! And then we REALLY SOAR!! Hang tight!"

"Big news on SRNE and DYAI, yet DYAI isn’t copied on the news release"
"I've read the entire transcript word for word. Quite impressive . They really have their things in order especially for the very near future! A beat of over 70% of the consensus for Revenue is remarkable as are their Sales. EPS was their ONLY downside of a quarter gone, but on the heels of a VERY promising future quarter ahead. PT needs to be set at $10.00. And that is being modest! I predict VERY frequent PR's in the VERY near future on the closing of the BINDING deal with Sorrento.(among other things) Which will sky rocket the stock price. Each PR drop on its inevitable advancements, will lead us further toward the modest $10.00 PT I mentioned earlier."

If you are registered for any of the events, you can also request a meeting through the event platform.About Dyadic International, Inc.Dyadic International, Inc. is a global biotechnology company which is developing what it believes will be a potentially significant biopharmaceutical protein productionplatform based on the fungus Thermothelomyces heterothallica (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila), named C1. The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines and drugs, such as virus like particles (VLPs) and antigens, monoclonal antibodies, Fab antibody fragments, Fc-Fusion proteins, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Certain other research activities are ongoing which include the exploration of using C1 to develop and produce certain metabolites and other biologic products. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of these technologies in development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic vaccines, drugs and other biologic products to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers, and improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.Please visit Dyadic's website at http://www.dyadic.com/ for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic's plans for its biopharmaceutical business.Contact:Dyadic International, Inc.Mark Emalfarb, CEOPhone: (561) 743-8333Email: memalfarb@dyadic.comSOURCE: Dyadic International, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/629688/Dyadic-to-Present-at-Upcoming-Events"
So few of us smart retail investors here. We are going to be rich. Cheers and hang tight.
Deals are likely to start happening after a great deal of focus on Serum Institute of India as per article in WSJ today https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-are-becoming-important-diplomatic-currency-11613152854 as well as all four of top animal pharma players now test C1. Just a matter of time. Earlier anticipation of potential deals were premature. Human and animal pharma takes time.

Shorts bite us! Just hold!!
Binding agreement with Sorrento for their created Vaccine and now Earnings today!! This is gonna explode AH and all.day tomorrow!!!
This is gonna be huge
"In Fox News saw that of the recent $8+ BN funding that $3 BN going towards vaccines. Yes, the vaccine companies and test kit companies are up and I hope they all figure this out for the world quick. DYADIC International out of FL is the holding company working on the vaccine being developed in Israel. $DYAI on the NASDAQ. Go on DYADIC International website. They perhaps could be first with a vaccine but I am invested in almost all of them. And the treatments we have for now that are being used in studies and compassionate use drug."
Iam holding
With this news and when the shorts are.forced to cover. this will be Parabolic!!!
This should get the shorts attention.
Zack’s Target valuation $10! Stock way over sold!
TIME TO EXPLODE 
I'm glad I stayed in this.
"Everyone that can, buy at least 100 shares each. Let's get some pre market buys coming in!!! Create momentumn and see if it will catch fire. If it does, the shorts will cover and their buys that they will make as they're squeezed out will send this through the roof. Then we trend get volume and go on to$ 6.00 and beyond. But, we need early buys even if they're small and then stay consistent at slapping that ask!! For anotherhundred or more especially around the VWAP intradaday! We are only talking $400-500 per person, but this will collectively squeeze out the Bears.Let's Rally!!!!!"
Nice one by Mark. Sounds robust But still: show me the moneyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjkIqMwM4I
So great
I have invested in Sorrento for over a year now and so far I know CEO Dr.Ji He likes to buy this small companies as subsidiaries. I would not be surprised if he purchased this one very soon. So make a most of it and buy as much as you can.

"The Company has make significant advancements in science with successful results in mAb, Antigen and vaccine expression suggesting that most if not all roads to commercialization of Covid-19 therapies will pass through Dyadic C1 technology due to exceptional yield, potency/titer and cost advantages. The Company has established numerous development partners which means the probability of success is dramatically higher than 6 or 12 or 18 months ago and accelerating! I’m very bullish the Company will have several monetization events in the near term. Share price s/b above $10-11 today so room to run!"

"With several major drug companies working to produce a COVID 19 vaccine, two vaccines virtually FDA approved and others (JNJ) in stage three trials, would there EVER be a better opportunity for Dyadic’s technology to be used to help produce at least one of these company’s vaccine?

In 50 years of investing, I cannot recall a company and its CEO doing more analysts presentations than DYAI. Hard work. Perhaps less would be more! Disappointed."

"Dyadic Announces Scientific Achievements Reported During ZAPI Stakeholders Virtual Web MeetingResults demonstrate that Dyadic?s C1 platform produced record levels of safe and effective vaccines in animal trials and further positions C1 products for potential human clinical trialsJUPITER, Fla., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dyadic International, Inc. (?Dyadic?, ?we?, ?us?, ?our?, or the ?Company?) (NASDAQ: DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving, applying and deploying its proprietary C1-cell protein production platform to accelerate development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales, today is updating the market on the Company?s key scientific achievements reported in the Zoonotic Anticipation and Preparedness Initiative (ZAPI) Final Stakeholders Virtual Web Meeting, which was held on February 4-5, 2021.ZAPI was a five-year research and development program sponsored by the European Union. Dyadic and its C1-cells played a key role in the #$%$20 million ZAPI program since its launch in 2015. ZAPI brought together experts in human and animal health to create new platforms and technologies that will facilitate a fast, coordinated, and practical response to new infectious diseases as soon as they emerge.Dyadic?s patented and proprietary C1 gene expression and recombinant protein production platform was selected by ZAPI as a production host of antigens for the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV). The SBV antigen from C1 produced 300 times greater yields than the SBV antigen from baculovirus and was more stable. Additionally, the C1 SBV antigen was shown to be safe and very effective (Full Protection) in protecting cattle and mice from the SBV. Based on these results, additional fully funded animal trials are continuing in 2021 with C1 expressed antigens for SBV and RVFV and to generate additional safety and efficacy data.Several positive outcomes have already originated from the ZAPI results, including several fully funded animal health projects and several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine collaborations, including Dyadic?s receptor-binding domain (RBD) antigen of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This vaccine candidate is being developed in various collaborations, including with three of the top infectious disease and coronavirus scientists who worked with Dyadic and C1 in the ZAPI consortium, the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) and others. These activities have positioned Dyadic to determine the best path forward for an anticipated first in kind human Phase 1 clinical program using the C1 produced RBD COVID-19 vaccine candidate.?Our participation in the ZAPI project has generated important safety and efficacy data as well as demonstrating very high antigen productivity. This data, along with other data generated outside of the ZAPI program, will allow us to apply our C1 technology in ways that we, and a growing number of scientists globally, believe can help industry and governments in the fight against existing and new infectious diseases as soon as they emerge,? said Mark Emalfarb, Dyadic's President and Chief Executive Officer.?Now that we have demonstrated C1?s performance and productivity benefits compared to other cell lines, we are engaged in discussions with global scientists, biotech and pharmaceutical companies as well as governmental agencies to explore other possible vaccine and drug applications for use in human and animal health,? continued Mr. Emalfarb. ?We look forward to potentially undertaking multiple IND enabling studies to allow us, and our collaborators, to enter the clinic with a number of recombinant protein vaccines and drugs.?During the conference, ZAPI scientists highlighted the pivotal role Dyadic?s C1 technology platform played in the ZAPI project. ?Efficient manufacturing processes are being developed and I specifically would like to mention Dyadic?s C1 fungal process which gives enormous amounts of antigens and I think especially in the face of the world?s situation with the pandemic, a system where you can produce much more vaccine would be an ideal one to look into so if that were to be the only spin-off, that would be fantastic.? stated Dr. Albert Osterhaus, Erasmus Medical Centre the ZAPI managing member.Dyadic?s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Ronen Tchelet commented, ?Our participation in the ZAPI program helped us accelerate the development of our C1 gene expression platform to rapidly develop and manufacture recombinant protein vaccines, at flexible commercial scales, faster, and more affordably than other traditional vaccine manufacturing processes, such as insect cells (baculovirus). The C1 platform has proven it is capable of producing safe and effective antigens in quantities that can help combat pandemics more affordably. The hyper-productivity data generated in the ZAPI project, along with the recent productivity demonstrated"
Today’s positive vaccine news from AstraZeneca and Pfizer very promising for DYAI
"Biggest news I've seen and the start of what everyone has been waiting for out of DYAI. They need deals that will provide ongoing revenue. This is still the ground floor, so time to get in."
Chart looks good! I would buy DYAI now before it is $7 or $8 per share!
THIS COULD MOVE DYAI TOMORROW !Early this week I called TD Ameritrade as to why DYAI was a CASH ONLY stock with no margin. I ended up burning up a lot of my cash to buy the stock anyway. Today after the close I suddenly got a big increase in B/P and I didn't know why. Finally I looked at DYAI and it was changed from non-margin to margin after todays close.My point is TD made the stock a lot more easy to buy more than twice as many shares for less cash. I don't know how many other brokers don't margin DYAI but TD is a very big firm and might make a difference in the PPS price with the increase in volume. I know I'am going to buy more with the extra B/PGOOL LUCK LONGS !
The SHORTS have not figured out that I own shares in this company! Here is to flying under the radar!

Approximately 7.8% of the shares of the company are shortOver 100% increase!!! Wow.. the only speed bumps are the lowly bears! Something tells me large buys coming force them to cover REALLY SOON. This stock is a prime candidate for a Parabolic squeeze! I want to be here when it happens. We will see 6's in a flash the 8' up to 10's in the near future with a PR drop.They got us today. Panic sellers sold..some., sadly for a loss. But those of us that held, remember ""They have to BUY to cover!!"" It's bound to happen! Whether that's tomorrow,Thursday or Friday. Institutions are still loading and these are great prices for them and other investors a like! And that could possibly cause the epic squeeze. I WANT TO SMELL BEAR HAIR FRYING!!!"
No activity on here because Yahoo keeps deleting my posts???..Anyone else notice?
"DYAI - just to make it clear, since there seem to be some haters or short traders here, who clearly need some clarification:1) Mark never said explicitly that C1 will produce 1B Doses of vaccine. But it is possible. And it's most likely faster (than CHO, E-coli and yeast), cheaper (than CHO for sure) and more stable (altogether). They proved it. Any other assumptions were made by Fox moderators who clearly have no clue.2) DYAI has been around for a while, mostly getting money for research. Well, yeah: They started with the pharma-branch 5 years ago. In the meanwhile they couldn't make any move due to some legal issues that have nothing to do with the science.3) Yeap, it seems PFE und MRNA won the race for Covid. But it's a different technology than C1. Go ask the big pharma why they wouldn't listen to DYAI. Besides, who's gonna vaccinate in India, China, South America, Africa? mRNA? No one can afford there even a 10$ pop. 4) Yes, it's a tiny company. 6 people cannot produce anything. But! C1 ist a platform that can be used easily by any person who's willing to pay royalties/license. Again, Mark is not going to produce anything. Go ask the big pharma why they wouldn't listen to DYAI. 5) So the company is young (in pharma-terms) and is trying to convince the big fish out there to go for C1. Why nothing has happend? My guess is politics. It's probably hard for the Production-Officers to admit that their science is inferior. So they keep on wasting billions. That is why I am here for the long. It's the science that seems to work. Everything else is just background noise."

"Dyadic Announces Nonexclusive Research License with WuXi BiologicsACCESSWIRE ACCESSWIRE•March 30, 2020JUPITER, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 30, 2020 / Dyadic International, Inc. (""Dyadic"" or the ""Company"") (DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving and applying its proprietary C1 gene expression platform to accelerate development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines, drugs, and other biologic products, at flexible commercial scales, today announced that it has entered into a nonexclusive research collaboration with WuXi Biologics, a leading global open-access biologics technology platform company and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO).Under the terms of the research license agreement, Dyadic will grant WuXi Biologics restricted access to its proprietary and patented C1 gene expression platform and allow WuXi Biologics to evaluate the C1 technology in a cGMP facility and to perform certain experiments to the C1 cell lines for any other internal noncommercial purpose. WuXi Biologics, one of the global top ten CDMOs, which provides development and manufacturing services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies globally, will invest its own resources to evaluate the C1 platform for their customers worldwide.""We are excited to announce this agreement with one of the world's most prestigious CDMOs. As highlighted by the current coronavirus vaccine and drug situation, there appears to be a growing market demand to find a faster and more efficient gene expression technology platform for vaccine and drug development and manufacturing. We believe that our C1 technology may be ideally suited to help fill this gap for many types of biologic vaccines and drugs and we are continuing to see interest from both our previously announced collaborators as well as other global bio-pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies,"" commented Matthew Jones, Dyadic's Managing Director, Business Development and Licensing.""We believe that today's announcement further highlights the diverse and growing opportunities for Dyadic to leverage its C1 technology platform to begin to help address the cost of goods issues associated with vaccine and drug development and manufacturing as well as to help overcome gene expression challenges that have either been shelved or stalled in R&D. The agreement with WuXi Biologics has the potential to further expand our global footprint and provide another potential catalyst for growth,"" said Mark Emalfarb, CEO of Dyadic.""Over the past decade, microbial fermentation has reached a higher level of sophistication, with wider adoption in the biopharmaceutical industry and we are excited to expand our technology platforms into this promising area, utilizing our extensive know-how in biologics discovery, development and manufacturing,"" said Dr. Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics. ""We have been exploring the right time to work with Dyadic in the hopes of further speeding the adoption and use of their industrially proven C1 gene expression platform. With our decision to expand our technology platforms and CDMO service offerings to include microbial fermentation, coupled with the significant improvements Dyadic has and continues to make to its C1 technology platform, it now seems like the appropriate time to evaluate C1 at WuXi Biologics where it may be better suited to speed the development, lower the cost and improve the performance of a number of biologic vaccines and drugs for our customers.""About WuXi BiologicsWuXi Biologics (stock code: 2269:HK), a Hong Kong-listed company, is a leading global open-access biologics technology platform offering end-to-end solutions to empower organizations to discover, develop and manufacture biologics from concept to commercial manufacturing.

The focus of Alphazyme matched with the power of our C1 technology makes this a very exciting opportunity for both companies. We believe this sub-licensing agreement, which includes an equity stake, milestone payments and royalties upon the commercialization of C1 expressed Alphazyme products further demonstrates the diversity of applications our C1 gene expression platform may help address.""""The molecular tools industry is fast approaching a critical constraint in its ability to produce the quantities of the enzyme tools required to drive large-scale production and detection of DNA and RNA.

where do u say thanks and call it a day?
"“Dyadic signs technology transfer, licensing agreement with Rubic Consortium” - big news for this one today!"
"CEO, Mark, says they are agnostic to which vaccines get approved ... they will strive to work with appropriate winners to produce potentially billions of doses w their C1 cell line for the world."
"Shorts have increased to~1.1M, betting against catalysts, the Company will disappoint! Hold your positions and add at these levels"
Zacks had a nice write up today
"Earnings Call:The usual...many irons in the fire, there could even be a deal in 2021. News... was that Serum Institute in India collaboration seems to be in stall mode...if it still exists at all. 50/50 this goes to under $3 (no deal), or jumps to $10 (a deal signed)...and probably somewhere in the middle: $7, once dosing gets significantly under way, by early fall. Short position will keep increasing here.There's a 2 Year survival clock here, and its ticking down on Mark E."
why's this dropping so fast ?
"Simple case hereof Shorts over staying (I won't say welcome, because they're not) I will say, they get greedy and stay way too long and give back profits. Now we are above vwap and volume will start to rise some smarter bears will cover NOW or SOON and that will cause the parabolic rise back way above 5!! Bye Bye 's"
