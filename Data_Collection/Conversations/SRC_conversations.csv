I think this spinoff is intriguing. The Shopko assets will be separated and should allow SRC to get the proper credit it deserves. Also the spun off asset will have some upside. The shopko holiday sales were uplifting. At a 9% dividend and the changes coming I think investors should be attracted to SRC.
