Release from yesterday - Alteryx (AYX) Remains at Centre of Takeover Talk: Betaville
I have this in my portfolio as a hold until 2023. By then I'm reckoning they will either be making money and completed the cloud expansion or will have been taken over. The fact that they have made recent acquisitions reinforces both assumptions.
"with the recent acquisitions, Alteryx finally got the message that they need to have cloud in their offering. This may be a surprise growth stock in 2021-2023."
"3.5 years, did nothing.... bag holders"
Will touch 85 soon good news coming ..load up its a take over very good price
Now I would say the stock is undervalued.
"At this stage, the key question is whether the management can be trusted regarding their statement about ARR - if the answer is yes, then a revenue surge should be expected in the coming quarters given how revenue has been lagging ARR in the past year. I think the management is believable given their high profile institutional investors base."
"All the comments in this board reflect a short term view or trading. This was was underperforming, brought in the ex Palo alto networks PRESIDENT, as CEO and are executing a turnaround tied to sales approach and business model change. It is a great turnaround story and will be a great long term investment. Doubt they will sell but never know. You donâ€™t leave Palo alto to fail or sell in 6 months."
Oops if you don't buy!

Alteryx job USA on Linked 7000 - last month 650 new impressive
"Take over talks: Tableau, Episode 1 ; Alteryx Episode 2 until 126."
"From one perspective, you look at the stock and say it's going down, something must be wrong. From another, since the IPO a few years back around $15, you say wow it's gone up 465% to $70 since then, something must be right? So which perspective do you enjoy? The reality is many companies experience employee turnover and management change, and many companies after their IPO go down for years. But what has exactly happened? What's the right perspective? GL"
Any news on this slide?
"Alteryx Announces Acquisition of Hyper Anna, a Leading Cloud Platform for AI-driven Business Insightshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/alteryx-announces-acquisition-hyper-anna-130000068.htmlAnyone see the terms of the deal?"
"You can ignore the takeover rumor I guess?...but now in October Alteryx has bought 2 private companies, so I would argue that the total value of AYX is now greater and not less. Puts them at least at $100 valuation now and not $96, GL, all it takes is one serious gap UP to end this WITCH HUNT."
Microsoft should buy it out. Companies dont like being so reliant on Alteryx but would be much more comfortable to leave it in MS software
"This is not a loved stock, but things revert to their means, and this is prolifically over sold. Expect a slow crawl back to 90 as others realize this and the company performs as expected"
Cloud Designer coming out.
"I sold my shares today. If it drops back down into the '60s, I'll buy it again but this is going to be a real long-term stock I think. I've never seen a stock get so little love as this one. Even when they have a fantastic quarter, not last quarter, but in the past, this thing would get dragged down. This is really just a day trader stock right now"
