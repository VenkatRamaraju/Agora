Alteryx job USA on Linked 7000 - last month 650 new impressive
RSI is 12 and that means well over sold territory. I bought in today at $117.57 and will enjoy the ride back up to normalcy. This Company has a great product that is in demand and will rise again after this temporary down day.
"the report is going to be bad, website traffic declined in the last quarter"
"our firm is hearing a beat on earnings as we have a position on this. take with a grain of salt, don't know the exact figures nor guidance. last quarter wasn't greatly affected by Covid-19 hence why guidance will be important for subsequent quarters."
"Really small gains compared to sector, suppressed by big tech!"
I wouldn’t be surprised if this stock regains its value back by Friday
Now I would say the stock is undervalued.
"AYX is great company with great future. Unfortunately, it is technically on downsides. It could drift down to low 70s. I have been accumulating last few weeks. If market trend down sharply or interest rates rises sharply over 2.5% this summer, whole market could go downhill. In that scenario AYX could possibly could to 60. I will continue to add. This is long term play for me."
Over last few weeks AYX has been outperforming other cloud stocks. I can see this moving higher to closer valuation as OKTA/COUP/... Its still relatively way cheaper than other cloud darlings.
"I admire your perseverance for holding this stock, lol"
Alteryx Unveils Analytic Process Automation Platform to Accelerate Business Outcomes for Companies Across the Globehttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alteryx-unveils-analytic-process-automation-platform-to-accelerate-business-outcomes-for-companies-across-the-globe-301056071.html
My only question is will any analysts raise their price targets into the $200+ area.
Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) reported quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.29 by 120.69 percent. This is a 6500 percent increase over losses of $(0.01) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $156.5 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $130.31 million by 20.10 percent. This is a 158.64 percent increase over sales of $60.508 million the same period last year.
"I am an old school guy . For me , this stock is undervalued now. Looking at their comparative fundamentals and growth , this is really a good buy if you looking for long term investment. Compare this stock with its opponents in industry, this will be one of the leading company when AI come into picture, that is where the value lies. For all those who wants to slowly add a descent AI stock to your portfolio , this is the one. btw, I am not saying this is the best stock in AI era."
"this traded 17 million shares on Friday. The float for this stock is 49 million. Of that 49 million 94% owned by institutions and 7.6 million shares are shorted. This stock will fly to the upside in my opinion. The shorts will need to cover and this was an over reaction because this stock has a very low float. Going to be a real good week for the bulls, GLTA"
"WITCH HUNT almost over, they can't keep this below $70! BUY"
So is everyone going to just ignore the takeover news now? Must be a big buyer trying to keep everything quiet now.
daam i cant believe i bought in at 120
"zacks were right, their sell rating was confirmed"
"while algorithms sell, the human brain should be buying. added 35 percent to my position at sweet glorious 94."
Is it down 6% on jitters alone? Where's the report?
"AYX gonna be over $100, thanks to All the buying and holding! $25 upside is the low end, bare minimum, 1/2 of intrinsic value, gains. Their software is top notch, big player, not small player, buyout should be 18 billion to be competitive to what CRM paid!"
to all the bag holders i say: good morning. how is the pain?
This thing far from finding a bottom. I'll look to jump back in once it's below $40.
Softy will buy this company
Change to 1 year contract in stead of giving discount make sense and is a good decision. Better value for Alteryx. And customer shall stay with Alteryx because of the product and the value it brings to them not because they have a 3 year contract and cannot get out. So absolute the right decision.
"Alteryx reports prelim Q4 results - sees revs of approx $59 mln vs $57.4 mln consensusQ4 billings, which represents amounts billed to customers during the period and is calculated as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, is expected to increase approximately 60% period-over-period. Dollar-based net revenue retention is expected to be approximately 129%, compared with 131% in the prior period."
Will touch 85 soon good news coming ..load up its a take over very good price
"$80 option strike is next target, $75 is yesterday!"
"About the same as Q1, $120 mil revenues, Net Loss of $35 mil, not good guidance for next quarter.... I expect price to drop for a while obviously..."
A seemingly promising stock but it's been such a painful year. I got out around $120 about ten months ago. The stock has been building a base for the past 5 months. I am giving it a second chance.
Holding long term. I use Alteryx's product every day. I have lots of confidence in their growth. There is no other company that allows users to be as effective and efficient by leveraging automation with data analytics. Alteryx has a lot of market still to reach.
buying opportunity. phenomenal company. way oversold. you can never time things perfectly. could it drop a little more? sure. could it start an aggressive ascent back up from here? definitely. all i know for sure is the company is way undervalued currently. you are definitely going to do well buying at this price.
I shouldve sold a long time ago..
Rumors or takeover. Hopefully it will be more than 20% today’s price. I got Medallia a couple of months ago and thought with the takeover it was going to be a bigger offer but was not that great!
"Ayx, crm, dt was not a work at home tech stocks or any of those covid stocks... These are good long term tech stock like msft, ibm and others.... I'm pretty sure in a few months or so, Ayx will probably be bought buy some other big names....$115 to $130 is a good price to get in."
The stock only goes up pre-market and aftermarket. Only time it stays in the green! 
"Insiders own over 12% of company, so that's very high conviction! Most companies have 3% or less!"
"Cash and equivalents of over 1b. So the markets really pricing the company at 3.5b. Guidance was a letdown, but everyone is guiding down this quarter. There’s no way this is only worth 3.5 b as a company!!! What a deal, grab some"
"From one perspective, you look at the stock and say it's going down, something must be wrong. From another, since the IPO a few years back around $15, you say wow it's gone up 465% to $70 since then, something must be right? So which perspective do you enjoy? The reality is many companies experience employee turnover and management change, and many companies after their IPO go down for years. But what has exactly happened? What's the right perspective? GL"
Stay confident and build your position. $AYX will show some strong price action going into Q2 earnings call on August 4th.
It will be a nice year when this witch hunt is over on AYX!
Company getting on avg 20k per customer per quarter. Need to increase contract amounts for very technical service.
"It must be painful for you guys, but AYX has much more downside tbh. NTNX went through a similar transition (the downward guidance issued by the AYX yesterday looked even fiercer compared to what shareholders of NTNX had to go through). Yet, NTNX was trading at <3x EV/Sales at rock bottom during its transition. AYX still trades at a significantly higher valuation.Luckily, NTNX successfully completed its transformation and now is on the path back to former highs. Let’s hope the same is true for AYX, but I fear it needs to get considerably worse before it might get better at some point in the future."
"looked like a good report but stock is down in AH, I think, on guidance issues. I will continue to hold long term and sell OTM calls against my position on a monthly basis to lower my cost basis and generate income."
AYX was oversold by 30 points when it was at 110. CRM gave an outlook and save all the software.
"Revenue was higher but GAAP and Non-GAAP profit was essentially unmoved from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021. Operation Losses were greater this Q2 vs. last year, but I take this as the company employing more cash to market or procure new customers. What I like is Guidance remaining as expected. This is a long haul guys. Hang in there. The company is getting more customers...that's the plus side."
Numerous price target raises:-> Wedbush price target $168 (from $152) maintains outperform-> Needham price target $167 (from $151) maintains buy-> Cowen price target $165 (from $147) maintains outperform
No growth stock won't be in the 70's long...down BIG is coming.
"this has nothing to do with current qtr beat. everything to do with 2021 Revenue and pipeline.2021 Rev forecast at $565M below estimates.HOWEVER, ARR is a big deal given accounting changes for AYX - $635M is a substantial increase so could provide upside - will learn more on the 5p call.Alteryx (NYSE:AYX): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.62 beats by $0.31; GAAP EPS of $0.32 beats by $0.26.Revenue of $160.5M (+2.6% Y/Y) beats by $6.86M.Full Year 2021 Guidance:Revenue is expected to be in the range of $555.0 million to $565.0 million.

EPS consensus of $0.73 consensus."
Any news on this slide?
There are 300+ companies in the same business as AYX. What are the chances that AYX will be bought?
Could someone with far more tech knowledge than me explain why Tableau was bought out for more than 3X Alteryx current market cap? 15.7 billion dollars?
"SAS Institute competes directly with Alteryx, says Rosenblatt - SASInstitute, which the Wall Street Journal reported is in talks to be acquiredby Broadcom (AVGO), is a leading analytics and data science platform businessintelligence vender that competes directly with Alteryx (AYX), Rosenblattanalyst Blair Abernethy tells investors in a research note. As such, theanalyst would view the purchase of SAS by Broadcom as a longer-term negativefor Alteryx. Broadcom would give SAS a greater profile and go-to-marketresources, Abernethy says. The analyst keeps a Buy rating on Alteryx with a$130 price target. The stock is down 5% to $79.54 following the Journal'sreport."
NTNX is way ahead in its transition. So why bother with AYX?
"Was just going to hit the sell button and slither away with a $12,000 loss but then started reading all the negative comments so have a buy in or 500 @ 102.80. Too many people giving advice to sell...sooner or later they will have to cover."
buy out might be 7 billion
"On the 31st Zacks Investment Research called AYX A toxic stock, giving it a # 3 rating which is a hold. On the other hand the last four or five articles citing other Tech companies, they mention AYX as a buy. with # 1 rating. Different authors? Do they even communicate with each other. Very misleading, Anybody else noticed that?"
"In all seriousness, I had the pleasure of working with a few consultants from Boston Consulting Group on a 9 figure contract. They used Alteryx to gather all our data from multiple sources, merge it, analyze, and present the data. Blew my mind. By by spreadsheet management, hello intelligent data design."
"The financial health of AUX is higher than MongoDB! Give it up shorts, Motley Stool!"
as I said 180 never again! Even 100 is no longer feasible for this stock. It will take years before this stock reaches 100
"Gross Margins are steady at 91%, Dollar-Based Next Expansion 132% ... awesome numbers"
"Sell that bottom! Sell, there are over 300 companies competing with Alteryx! 300+ lol."
"I wouldn’t characterize this pullback as a “collapse”. Nothing in the company changed yesterday, and all we saw was profit taking (I mean, you’d have to be crazy not to realize your gains after a run like the last 6mo). Sharp downward movements are intended to shake out investors who don’t know a stock’s true potential. And just like that, your panic-sold shares become someone else’s excellent entrance point."
"This is the EXACT same earnings call as last quarter. They had already announced it would be an average year LAST QUARTER, OLD NEWS. Look for yourself. It dropped to $98, than slowly bounced back up to $140. I traded on the dips and sold 3 times last quarter. Greatest stock ever to buy and sell. Just bought a bunch and hoping for somemore of a drop. NEVER FAILS!!!"
at this point I waiting for a buy out.
SaaS companies have been in a bear market since July. they will come back eventually as pretty much all valuations have come down to more reasonable levels
"Oppenheimer lowered its price target from $190 to $180; maintains outperform. Guggenheim lowered its price target from 130 to 125; cut from buy to neutral. Goldman Sachs cut its price target from 216 to 195; maintains a buy. I sold a small part of my holdings in the last couple of days at about 177 (to buy something else); after reading through the earnings call twice, I bought most back at the close yesterday (8/7) at 121.38. Alteryx is a great company, leader in a rapidly expanding industry. It has faced a slowdown in revenue growth due to the pandemic; its future is as bright as ever."
AYX a few 2 month later 127$
similar share price this time last year ($110)12 month revenue up 40% on prior year12 month gross profit up 40% on prior yearsurely it's time for this stock to get back to where it belongs in the $180 (then to infinity and beyond!)
Mark it this trades 90 by Friday. Anything under 70 is a screaming buy. Someone will come in and take them out for 120.
"Needham raises price target to $108Needham analyst Jack Andrews raised his price target on Alteryx to $108 and kept his Buy rating after its ""strong"" Q1 results and raised FY19 guidance. The analyst cites the the company's increasing focus on enterprise customers driving large initial land deals and strong customer additions, also noting that the company's self-service tools serve a ""pivotal function in the Big Data software stack."""
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Stocks-tracker.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Needham analyst Jack Andrews raised his price target on Alteryx to $90 and kept his Buy rating after its ""solid"" Q4 results that exceeded its pre-announced revenue. The analyst notes that as a results of ASC606 accounting adoption, the company will be able to ""recognize 35% to 40% of TCV billings within a quarter"", which results in sales acceleration. Andrews further cites the ""record number of customer additions"" disclosed by Alteryx and points to the ""broad demand across all use cases internationally."""
Is the earning release after or before the bell tomorrow?
"When the stock price is gunning for the IPO price 4 short years ago, and you are bummed today, look at all these negative posters and check them back to the highs of $180's, see if they were negative and so smart then? NOT."
Release from yesterday - Alteryx (AYX) Remains at Centre of Takeover Talk: Betaville
"Earnings beat again, amazing company and more importantly their customers love them > 128% expansion is incredible"
I don't understand why without negative news it still keeps falling
Market should rally some tomorrow after today's selloff. I expect AYX above $100
whats the tidings?
"Please listen to the conference call, folks. Please pay attention to the ARR number, which is more important than revenue. This is why: they are greatly reducing incentives for signing multi year contracts so the average contract duration is reducing to 1.5years from 3. Since revenue recognition is 40% upfront, less of it is recognized in the first year if the contract duration is shorter. I think they are doing very well based on the performance of the last quarter. The shorter contract approach results in more actual revenue in long run as long as the customer does not go away. I don’t think there are others that can substitute for ayx. I think they are doing well and well do better"
"Frustrating price action, looks like the street wants AYX to prove it wasn’t a one off quarter of growth. Growth went from 3% to 9 % last quarter. Guidance for next quarter is 17%. If it can indeed meet this, we are severely undervalued and will scream back in to triple digits. Enterprise spending is coming back, be patient!"
"""Cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2021 was $15.8 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.6 million for the first six months of 2020."" Cashflow looks ok. What you really need to gauge as an investor is if the company is employing capital effectively to grow. 10% net new customers since last year isn't great but at least it's positive. They have I think created that learning division to educate more companies about data and possibly make them new customers. I'd need to see how well other companies like AYX are doing in the area of obtaining new customers to see how this is in the industry (and to see if AYX is underperforming)."
Does anyone with far more technical knowledge than me have an opinion as to the company's products vs. CRM? Are they complementary or competitive? This industry seems set to consolidate eventually. Is AYX predator or prey?
2500sh avg $92. Will hold.
This a $20 stock in slow motion:)
"Looks like a nice base is forming. IMHO, it's time to start adding shares. Thoughts?"
Time is running out on this bear raid witch hunt on AYX. AYX is solid.
Lotta people will regret selling! Im buying more
Walletinvestor has a 1 year PT on AYX of like $10.60..at this point they don't look to be right.
excellent read. Interview with the CFOhttps://www.cmlviz.com/2019/11/19/AYX/alteryx-one-on-one-with-the-cfo--the-pick-axe-to-the-data-chaos-revolution.html
rekt thesis has changed the software is not mission critical for companies
Walletinvestor has AYX going to $8.55
Big overreaction yesterday. This is going up big time on its own or with a takeover. A definite.
"Just in: Alteryx assumed with an Outperform and $132 Price Target at WedbushWedbush analyst Daniel Ives assumed coverage of Alteryx with an Outperform rating and $132 price target. Ives says that while COVID-19 has negatively impacted expansion and new business activity in the near term, he expects Alteryx to exit the storm stronger as companies are now realizing the need for greater analytical rigor within their organizations.https://thefly.com/n.php?id=3151603"
Hold what exactly? I'm not selling until we reach 20x sales. We're currently at the lower bound of the price for the past 2 years. The growth will accelerate once the pandemic passes and businesses start to spend again.
Looks like a repeat of what happened after Q1 2020 earnings release. Stock was down 12% after hours. In regular trading the next day closed down on 2.9%. They missed EPS but beat revenue that time. This time they beat both EPS and revenue easily and the full year guidance is above street view (while Q4 is below and conservative as usual). Full year is above though. This could be green tomorrow or should come close to break even by close of trading. Let’s see if this happens again.
Seriously!! Anyone know what going on here. I keep averaging down but I’m at 35% of my portfolio and that’s way to much risk in one basket but I believe in the company.
"Been swing trading this thing for a while now, got lucky and sold my last position above 150. Starting a new position here, averaged in at like 112 for now, hopefully we go up from here!"
very bullish on this. prediction of $160 by end of fiscal year
"hey gregory, how are your buns? do not hurt? it seems your favorite company is not feeling well. well, nothing, maybe in 5 years it will be able to reach the price of 80....))))"
Oops if you don't buy!
$150 to $105 in 4 days. right after a report where they show accelerating 75% rev growth
It's a drawn out....zero confidence propaganda message to ensue a short selling attack on insider selling witch hunt! Insider selling is insignificant and 12.6% insider still owned is massive confidence!
"investors all year long:"" oh i wish price would go down so i can buy.."". when the price actually goes down:"" it's going down, run for the hills, sell sell sell....."""
"After noodling this for awhile I've decided to cut my losses by selling 2/3 of my holdings. I see small to no prospect for a big gain in the share price in the short term, I doubt the company is for sale or would be sold until the cloud transition occurs, guidance is lousy and there's a substantial chance of an overall market correction before this company gets it's act together. Still, I believe in the company long term and will revisit this investment periodically; at some point either exit or reentry will make sense."
RIP for all the bulls who bought in at 100+
Analysts on the call seem very impressed. Should get lots of upgrades tomorrow.

"Well, earnings and guidance sucked...again. Fool me once, so it's time to bail or stick around and hope they get acquired, and soon. Either way, I have a sell order in already for half my position."
"$60's, $50's, $40's? I guess Alteryx is done, gosh!"
"This is not a loved stock, but things revert to their means, and this is prolifically over sold. Expect a slow crawl back to 90 as others realize this and the company performs as expected"
"Yep, anyone buying now is a sucker, but not when it was trading at $185/ share, buying then was genius! Now that's it's $73, we're all suckers and AYX is overvalued because the growth is all gone. Wrong. I'm buying and I'm holding."
"There is a great deal of misinformation concerning the CEO's recent sale of 30k shares at price of around 109. First of all, there are many reasons for insiders to sell shares from purchasing a home to meeting financial obligations to diversifying his/her portfolio; one should never read too much into it. When insiders put out their own cash to buy shares is, on the other hand, an important positive signal that they regard the shares as undervalued. In the case of Alteryx, the CEO and co-founder Dean Stoecker owns about 130,000 of the Class A shares and 8,387,947 of the Class B shares, amounting to about 12.8% of the 66,176,000 outstanding shares. It is common for leading insiders to receive a significant part of their compensation in the form of stock options or grants. Stoecker receives 30,000 shares on or about the 13th every month and has an automatic sell program for those shares (probably feels that 8.5 million shares is an adequate holding). Automatic sell programs are commonly used by insiders to avoid charges of trading on insider information; they in no way indicate a loss of faith in the company."

"Market appears to be rotating from growth to value stocks. I saw this happen in 2000. IMHO, there are many differences between now and 2000. In 2000 value stocks were very profitable and paying high dividends, Many growth stocks were not profitable and required more funding to stay in business. Neither of these are true today. In fact, just the opposite. With the growth of electric vehicles, many oil companies are vulnerable of going bankrupt. AYX is profitable and artificial intelligence is a growing field. I think this change from growth to value is temporary."
"Pretty good beats on both, plus was oversold, should go up a lot tomorrow.A beat by $0.08 on earnings of $0.17Third Quarter Revenue of $103.4 Million, a beat of $13M"
I like this stock but... PEG 1700. Why?
I've been in and out of AYX for the past 2 years. I always kept a small position but sold when it was too over valued and bought when reasonable again. This volatility has happened several times in my 2 years holding. This looks like a time to add again somewhere around today's low. It is still a high quality company that is doing fine.
Can someone copy and paste article from Seeking Alpha on rumours of buyout here please ?
"Wow the stock jumped today don't know the reason why, but not much reaction from the people on this board ...."
breaking: Alteryx price target raised to $202 from $150 at Citihttps://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3035835&headline=AYX-Alteryx-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Citi
"Well this one is a ride! My belief is today's rise is driven by minor over-estimate performances from PLAN & CRM (which play in the AYX space) and a correspondingly massive rise in their prices. I've spent my career largely in the BI/Analytics space and think I know my stuff, but have to say I am now perplexed about how to value these players. That said I bailed @145 and came back in @110 so I'm a happy camper. Looking forward?... AYX is an excellent offering, is not going bust any time soon and could easily get bought by someone with deep pockets (ref Tableau) . In the meantime good luck all."
"AYX competitors like MongoDB (ticker: MDB) up 25% today because YOY revenues were up 40%+. AYX continuing to lose market share...so BUY, BUY, BUY according to the perma bulls here"

"The question is: is the stock already ""priced for perfection"" where perfection means beat & raise with bullish guidance? If so, we tread water at best. If not, there's room to run. The problem is in accurately (dispassionately) reading market sentiment.

"Growth was 25%! not sure what people want. Wait for the cc, wouldn’t be surprised if green tommorow"
"Alteryx has been growing more than 45% per year since going public until this year, when growth is expected to be 11.6%, and next year, when it is expected to be 27.2% (both estimates are likely to be too low). The company is largely an SaaS (software as a service) company, but it does have marketing/sales people visit company sites to show buyers how to use the software--and this has slowed dramatically during the pandemic. Analysts covering it have an average buy rating (5 strong buys, 5 buys, 3 holds and 1 sell), with an average price target of $162.64. Alteryx provides data analytics for companies--the need for this will only increase over time. One expert in the field provides the following example:""Home Depot has 2000 stores, it has 200,000 skus and each store will hold 100,000 skus. You can imagine all the combinations and permutations this yields. Alteryx is the key to harnessing this data. It takes Home Depot 2 weeks to crunch and simply prepare data from the permutations when traditional software is used. It takes Alteryx software under one hour. It tells Home Depot exactly which product to place on which shelf during July of a calendar year (a solution to a question with millions of possible outputs). It tells them what product to make seasonally available. It tells pro sports teams who to put on the floor in the last 2 minutes of a game."" I added to my holdings yesterday."
look at the trading...to my eye. it is a continuation of the short from a while ago. perfect environment for pulling it off....but it can't continue with the improving business.
"People spreading Too much FUD, buy and hold on through!"
i am considering selling for 10 percent loss... and move on. not worth my health
Whole SaaS and cloud sector sold off this last week and half. Not company specific means to stick with it if nothing fundamenallly has changed with company.
Anyone that’s owned this stock for a decent amount of time knows they always guide low and beat earnings. This company will be fine
I don't get why it dropped so much today...bizarre the way the stock market works...manipulate it lower and then push it up higher. it works on some people as they fall into the trap
Alteryx Fundamentals Continue To Shinehttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4302256-alteryx-despite-stock-weaknesss-fundamentals-continue-shine
Bought 200 shares on breakout above 123 but no volume today. Long term hold. It is in the right space for future growth.
"I sold my shares today. If it drops back down into the '60s, I'll buy it again but this is going to be a real long-term stock I think. I've never seen a stock get so little love as this one. Even when they have a fantastic quarter, not last quarter, but in the past, this thing would get dragged down. This is really just a day trader stock right now"
There is life!
"Anyone who bought the stock 2+ yrs ago is still underwater, at a time when so many cloud stocks have gone to the moon  Management should just put the company on sale and move into the twilight..."
There is speculation that alteryx will be bought out? Saw this on the stock's news
"Buoyed by the strong results, Alteryx raised its outlook for full year 2019. The company currently expects revenues for the year in the range of $389-392 million, compared to the previous estimate of $370-375 million. Outlook on adjusted net income was also raised to range of 57-60 cents per share, versus the prior estimate of 44-50 cents per share."
"A quick read of the conference call. They expect revenue to increase 25% in 2021. But prior to Covid it was increasing 62% and stock price was increasing 100% per year. The SP is way ahead itself and likely to return to $110 (IMHO). This could be a buying opportunity for patient investors for two reasons. 1.) Company has a free academic program in place training 14000 data scientist how to use their platform. 2.) Sales are still being impacted by Covid. With infection rates declining at a time when they were increasing during the 1918 pandemic, light at the end of the tunnel is in sight. AYX is using this pause to build on-line partnerships for the next growth phase. The analogy is Netflix transitioning from mail order to streaming. 2022 could be explosive. Unfortunately markets don’t usually look that far ahead. But with most growth stocks being well above their 50 day moving average, it could be refreshing to buy a growth stock that is below its 50 day moving average."
"I can't see anything in the earnings report that will have me running for the hills. Still fantastic growth year-over-year and a huge top-line beat this quarter.Guidence is ""eh""....still estimating a 10-15% YOY revenue increase, but compared to a 43% YOY increase in revenue this quarter, that is very underwhelming. The balance sheet is fine. Cash on hand has increased, and they will make it out of this recession. Nothing changes to the long-term outlook in my opinion and i'll be looking to buy if it gets to the low $90's/high $80's. This stock price has been perenially overvalued, and even after hours trading has it overvalued in my opinion."
Priced about right based on guidance and their 12 month prospects. Love the company but I’m out for a nice profit against my $96 cost basis
shocked is a word here -
"What can be walked down on low volume, can be walked up on low volume, stealth! BUY. Minus One hundred a ten dollar per share discount!"
Solid story on its way up. It is a long term invest.
I’ll never understand why people get so worked up over earnings of these cloud companies. A $4.5B cloud company should not even be thinking about profitability….it’s an infant. Invest your revenue back into the business! Revenue is growing at 25% people! Earnings will be there in the future.
Their accounting methods make me think we have a $160 stock going at a huge discount right now. And may double digits after the next earnings update. But onwards and upwards after that. I am thinking $500 plus in the next few years
Can’t believe this is 77 dollars.
"I hope everyone listened to the er or at least read it. Interesting on the revs front concerning contract terms and pricing. Customers are wanting shorter contracts that allows them to modify, change their particular needs vs a more hassle change with a 3 yr. contract. Give the people what they want. As stated, increases value to the company by eliminating the discounts they offered customers for a longer contract, profit increase for the coffers of AYX, and better to serve the customer with this shorter contract. Competitive field and churning of customers is and has been expected but still retain over 90% overall on renewals. Not to bad. It seems that ""the sky is falling"" reaction is by switching to shorter contracts, which is what customers are wanting. The columns that the revs have been reported in the past are the same but they will be increasing, steady or falling as this change is taking place. The CFO explains it pretty well in the transcripts. Still adding new customers, partnerships with other companies (SnowFlake is one), oh and they have over $1,000,000,000 in cash on hand. That's alot of zero's, kind of like all the uninformed negative nellie's on board here. I believe that the next 2 quarters will help reveal that AYX is on the right path or there is a chronic problem here. There is a great need and value here just need to see if management or some other company can bring it to the shareholders. GLTA>"
"You can keep shirting, YES, but just like AMC, you can lose big time! BUY Alteryx! Private Equity money is circling the waters of speculative offers."
to all of the bag holders: good morning
Have a feeling the floor will be at $115-$120 for a while with a small run up into the next quarter. I loved the answers management had during the press conference and I still believe this is the best product in the data science/data visualization space. Have to look at the YTD stock price appreciation and not since the pandemic. It's still up 20% in 41 days from $100 where we started at the beginning of the year. Soft guidance but that means potential easy beats and the ARR raise to 27% seems bullish on behalf on management. Stay patient.
When you (retail) sell their computers will kick in a drive it up big $125 or so. I have seen this over and over on other stocks. Guess what? I will hold this stock for YEARS!!! and add more if it drops ...but I doubt that....they could be bought out at anytime.
"huge stone of my heart, just sold. didnt want to say this before because i was still holding: do the math, this company is worth 38 $ at best- 500 revenue X 20% profit margin (average industry)= 100 M. 100 X 25 (PE) (growth PE)= 2.5 billion $ market cap, which is 50% down from today."
"New to this stock....was recommended by a new newsletter is just bought...Trying for an opening position today.""Right now, Alteryx services 37% of the Global 2000 – the World’s Largest Public Companies – and has the potential to take over this entire market category.Selling this powerful, accessible technology opens up Alteryx’s total addressable market (“TAM”). The overall data analytics space is enormous… Conservative forecasts are for the TAM to grow to $110 billion by 2025. Right now, Alteryx services less than 1% of the data analytics TAM.If Alteryx continues to grow its revenue at 70% per year, as it has historically, the company would still only be at 6% of the total market share over the next several years"""

I knew that was going to last long. Insiders are going to buy this up like crazy. Watch volume go through the roof. Yesterday was a once in a lifetime opportunity. There is no way a stock goes from $180 to $67 and remain there for long.

"a nice 7% discount without any reason, other than algos. Thank you, I was waiting to add to my position long term position."
"Accidentally stumbled on AYX. Strong support at 500 dma ($101). A bargain below 250 dma ($124). Stock should be based on revenue growth, not earnings."
"AYX is having a spring sale.Buy now at these low, low prices while the deal lasts!"
I am buying here. Not worried. Hold on for the long term!
oh my goodness... how much is it?
"AYX did a good thing by re-evaluating their number for future quarter 2020. They decided to go with conservative number which is safe to reach versus to have a high target and finally dont reach it because of covid long term effects there is still a huge risk out there with the “second wave” imagine if AYX forecast growth of 21% FY just like the analyst and suddenly who knows second wave, un-employement, presidency, etc. However, this company have a good balance sheet and had proven in the past they are growing. Today, i was finally able to get some share at a really fair price!!"
No bottom in sight. No growth.
I have researched Alteryx and have found many wonderful things about the company. It is on many analysts's buy lists as outperform. The room for growth is enormous so why hasn't a bigger company bought it? Just wondering.
Today is the second one of several SHORT SQUEEZE days to come in the next few months for Alteryx! It's time for shorts to cover their remaining positions!
Do we have anymore news on the buy out?
"me at 107 years old: ""this stock is gonna go up to 90, you will see. its worth holding"""

"At this stage, the key question is whether the management can be trusted regarding their statement about ARR - if the answer is yes, then a revenue surge should be expected in the coming quarters given how revenue has been lagging ARR in the past year. I think the management is believable given their high profile institutional investors base."

"Alteryx price target raised to $216 from $164 at Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs analyst Christopher Merwin raised the firm's price target on Alteryx (AYX) to $216 from $164 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. In light of the current interest rate environment, the analyst adjusted assumptions in the discounted cash flow component of his valuation methodology, which drives increased price targets across the software sector. The ""resiliency"" of the sector throughout COVID-19 underscores the ""criticality"" of many software categories as businesses adjust for more distributed workforces and therefore require modernized cloud systems, Merwin tells investors in a research note. With sector multiples at all-time highs, the analyst favors stocks where he sees ""compelling relative value."" Merwin's best ideas currently are ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), Alteryx"
"I believe the risk reward sets up quite well, right here. Between Thursday and Friday, the stock got over a 33% hair cut. Which I believe was extremely over done.Looks like analysts agree, as many barely moved their price targets:Alteryx price target lowered to $195 from $216 at Goldman Sachs, BuyAlteryx price target lowered to $185 from $195 at Piper Sandler, OverweightAlteryx price target lowered to $180 from $190 at Oppenheimer, OutperformAlteryx price target lowered to $172 from $192 at Needham, BuyMy reasons for adding:1. As noted in article, company always guides very conservative (just like they did the previous quarter, and then beats). So it fully makes sense for them to do so again given we are still in the midst of the pandemic (and even with their conservative forecast as still projecting to grow their revenues). With ARR projected to grow 30%.2. They are best in breed in their field with long term multi year/decade secular tailwinds at their back. They used this time to further enhance and build out their APA platform. Which will allow them to hit the ground running as the virus issues get better resolved. This will allow a rapid re-acceleration of revenues. When this occurs their will be little time to get on board (Without missing a quick 25-50% upside). It will not take much to get this, it could simply be in the next quarter a simple comment about an improvement in outlook and conditions in the market and it will be a rocket higher.Many people are looking for a ""re-opening"" stock to buy in anticipation of better news on the virus / vaccine front. I would contend Alteryx is an excellent choice especially after their recent selloff has been largely de-risked. One that offers a potential 100% upside within 12 months, 300 % potential in 24months, both on a stand alone basis (or possible takeout target)."
Beat earnings by a whooping 68% and beat revenue by over 6%? I LOADED up in the post market. What a steal
"Don’t like AYX because the company is way behind peers when it comes to transitioning to the cloud. Will take much more time and efforts before we see light at the end of the tunnel. Hence, I prefer NTNX since this company is much further with its transformation."
The $75 battleground is so yesterday! Welcome the $80 strike! And I welcome the $85 too by Sept. 17!
"In a report released today, from Oppenheimer maintained a Buy rating on Alteryx Inc, with a price target of $85. The company’s shares closed yesterday at $67.60.“This week we hosted investor meetings with Alteryx’s management and come away bullish. Our key takeaway is that Alteryx has a long runway of growth ahead, though we also highlight the following: (1) the competitive environment remains benign; (2) customer expansion activity is strong and could potentially be sustained for the foreseeable future; (3) customer penetration rates remain low; (4) multiple growth avenues beyond current use cases are available; and (5) M&A activity could pick up. Alteryx remains in a heavy and front-loaded investment mode with an opportunity to disrupt a large market (~$1B in revenue within reach). We expect such investment to yield positive results and consistent productivity gains, both of which we believe would be viewed positively by investors. Maintain Outperform.”"
"If you listen to the earnings call, management highlights that 2021 will be a ""transition year"". The company is a year or 2 behind the competition in moving to the cloud in properly serving is core customers. Reinvestment into its technology was probably a significant reason for reducing 2021 earnings by 90%. If you're confident that the company can make the""transition"", perhaps it can return to growth mode. If the company did not successfully make the transition, the company will continue to lose market share. In the short term, I would think that the sp sells off until investors become confident that the transition is bearing fruit."

AYX small float 58mill...Lots of Institutions in it..and they produce free cash flow...saw this same situation with bitcoin..drop all the way back to $5 and then WHAM UP she went...same thing will happen here..mainly due to two things..small float and free cash flow.
