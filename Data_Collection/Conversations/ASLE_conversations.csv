"Finally got some movement again, what’s the news update I need my $ASLEW to fly"
I hope everyone here knows that earnings are out today after the close. Fingers crossed as this seems to have some momentum today. A close above $11.37 would be a new high in a month. Best to us all.
"The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination. Dec 23, 2020 .. If my math is right, January 12 ish... Should see parity... I will buy some more warrants today under valued by 50%-60%"
"Warrants are so under valued , will buy more"
"New 52 week high for the warrants, new 6 month high for the stock. Someone knows something."
"I was here a year ago, I'm here today, and I will be here 1 year from now."
Can someone tell me what the ASLEW warrants are realistically worth? I see varying numbers from a few different internet sources. Thanks in advance.
warrants holding their value
"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397185-top-bitcoin-and-spac-bets-for-2021?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=chris-demuth-jr-top-bitcoin-and-spac-bets-for-2021&utm_campaign=rta-author-article&utm_content=link-0""The biggest opportunity in deSPACed equities is AerSale (ASLE). Since the warrant disclosure, they more than quadrupled. Equity is up since the position was disclosed. It is history’s third best performing deSPACed equity among those with such a high redemption rate (94%). Redeeming holders simply made a terrible mistake with a huge opportunity cost. Today, their equity costs under $14 and is worth $10 per share more. Even as the market awaits verification of its value as a newly standalone public company, it should trade in the $18-24 range. Once it secures FAA approval, their AerAware product launch later this year could represent another $10 per share of value for a $34 per share upside.""This guy knows his stuff. I'm in today 14.60 with a healthy position. GL to us all. May everyone have a very Happy and Prosperous New Year."
"It looks like the stock is trading down to the warrants rather than the warrants trading up to the stock. I think this is more of a long term play. The warrants remain very cheap. They do not account for any time value. I would think at least 20 or 30 cents of time value would be appropriate. With this one, you have to wait for a year until the airlines start taking off again. Then the stock will double and the warrants will go from 2.70 to 20. I am holding for now. Sitting on my hands. No reason to do anything."
"Some good information from the Cowen Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference presentation. Just a few tidbits... Sounds like they fully expect AerAware to be approved by FAA later this year. The delay has been from software updates to fix glitches in the system, otherwise all feedback from FAA test pilots have been extremely positive. They've also had some delays in receiving the remainder of the 24 planes they purchased. Sounds like they expect to be able to turn the 24 planes into 18 fully functional cargo planes to be sold off."
"Wow What a bargain at 9.50 these people who selling must be a desperate, or got their shares for free."
"Glad to be home guys, I will be back in tomorrow just decided to take my 100% all-in profit and move all of it into GHSI where I secured a 50% gain overnight, now I’m cash ready to comeback to this winner . GLTA!!"
I will be buying more ...
If Maintains 15 .. One rich man is going to get richer with another million shares as incentive
Taking their time apparently
Still under valued....
Hopefully all these baby traders sold their shares today.. 13.26 ... All this needs is a little news
Cohen as a market perform... ROFLMAO just to allow his clients to profit
The Volume is anemic for this size of company. Shares are being held tight. So this will go down one or two ways . I am betting for explosion to upside by August.
George Bauer has be reported as having 9.8 % stake in ASLE..

"Good to see you still here yahoo, how are you doing?"
I find it interesting that this is down pre market considering how the spike between the equity and warrants were inaccurate and left the warrants even more undervalued
The warrants are slowly gaining correlation with the equity but it shouldn’t be taking so long. These should be trading around $5 at this price .
Time to greedy ... Addd ADDDD
ASLE reached an all time high at 17.10
it amazes me that people are selling the warrants below real price .. at 15$ - warrants are worth 3.50$ without adding the time value
"@SteveStrike is 11.50 and you can use an option price calculator to determine the worth. You will have to estimate the implied volatility as well as the expiration date (because warrants can be force exercised once the stock clears $18). If we assume one year to expiration, and IV = 38, and interest rate 2% and dividend 0, then you get a price of 2.39 which is about what the warrants are currently trading at. Personally, I think that IV is a little bit high for this stock, meaning that the warrants are bit over-priced. However, worth is in the eye of the beholder. I own some warrants and I and not selling them."
"Rookies .. this is going way higher , profit takers will be sorry..."
could anyone explain why this company in supposed to be so undervalued .It seems to be at just an ok valuation based of cash flow and earning multiples
no support.. still in free fall
easy go to $23 in 1 or 2 months
buying more S1 scared low life investors today... time to add when fear is in the air
Love to know what the news is
One more interesting thing is the last earn out that i see is at 15$ per share. So the executives have every incentive to drive the share price up to earn $$$$$.
yes got filled at 2.35 warrants....
"CEO is buying shares and warrants , yet these dum Az retail investors are not buying this. This is reason why I'm a millionaire. In a few months this will be way north of $15"
ASLE is down 20.54% to 13.31
"@yahooFrom the latest current report off the Aersale web page. Warrants — The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination provided that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within 90 days from the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement or a current prospectus, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that the Company is unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. In addition, any Private Warrants held by Cowen will not be exercisable more than five years from the effective date of the registration statement. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.There are a number of caveats in all that. It says that they need a registration statement (S-1 ?) to provide for the exercised shares. If they don't have the S-1 (if they did not bother to submit one), then they may (optionally) do cashless exercise if an exemption is available. Otherwise, they are NOT required to settle the warrants. It is not clear to me that the warrants are presently exercisable; and nor is it clear to me that we have an exercise date. It seems to be kind of open ended right now, but I guess we will find out. It should be possible to contact the company directly and ask them for information."
Parity ... Yes..... now this will double in 2 months ...
buying more soon.. rookie trading is almost over
Well...so much for that opportunity this morning at 2.44. Good going whoever got those 4k warrants.
"bottom appears to be set 10.80 , great time to add shares for 16 Price target .. This was shorted...Now shorts will pay up"
"@yahooI talked to Interactive Brokers. They said that the warrants were ""not yet settled"", meaning that you could not exercise them yet. I don't think that the exercisable shares exist yet. I think ASLE still has to file an S-1. I sent an email to the company. Hopefully, they respond."
added another 4k warrants
"This is a Monster winner for me and the more I research news and insight, the more amazed I am that NO ONE knows about this company. Not one tidbit on any SPAC sight I know of? Anyone else have thoughts on this?"
@yahooSee here for detailed info regarding exercisability. https://content.equisolve.net/sec/0001104659-20-120867/tm2029543-1_10q.htm
Should see a spike at open tomorrow and then a drop to a sideway 2-4% positive throughout day
"@yahooIt it not clear how much time value a warrant really has, given that the company can force early exercise. Once the price is above 18, the company can force early exercise. So you really don't have all the way out until 2025. Anyway, on the assumption that these warrants have six months left on them, option price calculator indicates that these warrants have a present delta of 0.91 -- in effect, they are almost like stock. In the calculation, I used 0% for the interest rate and 30% for the IV. Theoretical price is 3.636 with 3.50 of intrinsic value and only 16 cents of time value. I suppose IV could be higher, but once they have their first earning report, and the stock settles down, I don't see why IV should be higher than any other stock in its same industry. If they really do have three years of time value left in them (and will not be force-exercised early), then the deltas decrease to 0.78 and the theoretical price becomes 4.80. If you assume an IV of 50%, then the six month value is 4.09 and the three year value is 6.38."
Little patience an warrants will be $$$... PT is 16
"Very good q1 result, be ready for good days"
Wow up 40% in a few days work
What f o ols are selling today.. This is going to 20$
trying to buy more warrants today at 2.80 by adding another 5k
Giving this one another 30 days to show some spark
Does anyone know if the warrants are capped to a certain exercise price?
ASLE and ASLEW both starting to heat up. Somebody accumulating on the sly.
Warrants Still under valued
All you need to know is that someone has 15 mllion incentive to get this above 15
Warrants still under valued by 20% but gap is closing
Warrants now well above $5 in premarket trading.
"Short Consolidation after big spike, we will see next move forward soon"
"Warrants are still so undervalued , will buy more if stays below 3"
"91% held by institutions, 41m shs outstanding, 145k shs traded today current price means absolutely nothing"
The warrants may double after ASLE provides a business update ..
Hey mgmt wake the #$%$ up
I am under the assumption that they cannot call in the warrants until they trade over 18$ per share???
"Warrants are a pretty good way to own this stock as it would be hard for them to drop much lower. The warrants only cost about two bucks each right now. We are going to need to see some positive news regarding maintenance contracts for this stock to move up. Once the economy starts to recover from COVID, air-traffic related stocks should move up."
Today is good day.. I owned warrants since 1.15
50% retracement from the pop is good opportunity
"It looks like ASLE is filing an S-1 form today. They are giving themselves the right to both issue new shares and also the right to issues shares for the purpose of satisfying previously issued warrants. On the one hand, this is likely dilutive (as any S-1 would be). This could result in short term pressure on both the stock and warrants. On the flip side, if they raising money, that means they have a need for the money, and AerSale remains an excellent recovery play. If aircraft start flying again, the need for maintenance will increase dramatically. Right now, ASLE is preparing for a future where aircraft maintenance is in higher demand. I don't know if the S-1 necessarily changes things a lot. Every SPAC will eventually issue one or more S-1 forms. They must, in order to exercise the warrants. We knew this was coming, but who knows what the short term market reaction will be. You may recall that QS got whacked when they issues their S-1."
"Only fool would not be buying, EOY 2021 this will be 18$ plus .. Money in the bank"
"Recent insight from a highly reputable investor...AerSale has multiple ways to win. The market could give it an industry multiple based on the company's current business mix; that could be a double for the stock in 2021. But what if the market ignores their current business? It could easily double anyways because there are so many embedded options that are ripe for success this coming year. The industry could recover and aircraft servicing is a levered bet on that recovery. Even without a recovery, servicing benefits from the chaos of turning so many passenger planes into cargo planes. And their shareholders get free calls on a range of promising engineered products that could be worth more than the whole rest of the company once the FAA approves them and they hit the market. Stay tuned. Another free call: projections don't include growth from M&A despite a great industry consolidation opportunities. And one more: projections don't include substantial growth from government contracts. But both M&A and government contracts could soon be big growth engines over the next several quarters. By that point, shares are likely to trade in the $18-24 range. That is why this is my top SPAC equity for 2021. Amidst a SPAC boom, this is a true value investment that will stand the test of time."

Good Volume glad to see some distribution.... Coheen caused the sell off to allow his followers to get in bellow 16...
"Any positive news and this will explode, limited shares avaliable"
The after hour power of these warrants are undoubtedly immanent
Interesting 14.00 might start to add in this range
$100-120M in earnings this FY based on a VERY VERY good analyst note.$2.40 in earnings this FY.$36-48 a share in 12-months or less is his personal target.Take it for what it's worth; one person's opinion but based on facts.$BA
"@yahooI bought some warrants at 2.75 then shorted the stock at 15 as a hedge. I asked interactive brokers for immediate exercise. I don't know what the first possible exercise date is. The warrants do have time value, although the stock trades very thin and has no options and would be hard to scalp. The stock is hard to short. Something like 15% annual interest rate to short the shares. You would not want to hold the short for very long."
Oh boy let’s see where this is going
I am very Bullish and will overweight this in my portfolio .. Bought more at 12
buying more here 2.67 wow what a bargain
Monetization ...Get your popcorn ready
Best value on warrants i have ever seen....
"So the real kicker on this play in the airline industry is when ASLE gets added to JETS, the US Global ETF. The company fits all of the parameters to qualify for this ETF and with it's crazy small float, any institutional size purchase will push the price up into the high teens/low twenties. You really want to own this stock before that happens as it will literally open a HUGE DOOR of opportunity here."
"ROFLMAO, rookies selling... Dont they know this is a 20$ stock they are selling at $14"
This float mostly owned by institutions.... it will go higher
Freshly merged
"SEC has approved S1. Now warrants can be traded in for shares, should see warrants trade up to par. Warrants convert at 11.50 ."
Cohen messed up the advance ...He wants his followers to capitalize on the move... Wall street games
Come on FOMO Investors .. this going to 20's
I will convert my warrants if they remain this low... Market is inefficient. Warrants are worth 5$ right but trading at 3$
