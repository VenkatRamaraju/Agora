George Bauer has be reported as having 9.8 % stake in ASLE..
"Some good information from the Cowen Aerospace/Defense & Industrials Conference presentation. Just a few tidbits... Sounds like they fully expect AerAware to be approved by FAA later this year. The delay has been from software updates to fix glitches in the system, otherwise all feedback from FAA test pilots have been extremely positive. They've also had some delays in receiving the remainder of the 24 planes they purchased. Sounds like they expect to be able to turn the 24 planes into 18 fully functional cargo planes to be sold off."
No one noticed again that AerSale has bagged a new contract with Norse Airlines.
could anyone explain why this company in supposed to be so undervalued .It seems to be at just an ok valuation based of cash flow and earning multiples
"$ASLE WE HAVE LIFTOFF!!!

bought more warrants added 10k
Does anyone know if the warrants are capped to a certain exercise price?
Well I said $2 valuation at the right time
"91% held by institutions, 41m shs outstanding, 145k shs traded today current price means absolutely nothing"
3 BUMPS COMING:FAA Approval - Imminent - BUMP to $30Earnings - November 3 - BUMP to $453 Airline Purchases - approx. $60M Rev - $BUMP to $60 all in 2021
The after hour power of these warrants are undoubtedly immanent
I am under the assumption that they cannot call in the warrants until they trade over 18$ per share???
One more interesting thing is the last earn out that i see is at 15$ per share. So the executives have every incentive to drive the share price up to earn $$$$$.
The warrants are slowly gaining correlation with the equity but it shouldn’t be taking so long. These should be trading around $5 at this price .
"$ASLE This is what can happen with a SPAC. Only a tiny portion of the company is offered as shares. So the floats are low. Then there is misunderstanding that AerSale is some kind of start-up or baby company when it is one of the industry leaders. Then the shorts take a big position based on bad perception of company.SO NOW: 18% short position, really no way for shorts to close their positions. THEY ARE STUCK. IF they tried to close their shorts we would be at $100 today.AS LONG as holders of this stock keep holding and don't sell, this one will MOON one day soon."
added another 4k warrants
"BATON ROUGE, La., Oct. 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Prescience Point Capital Management, a research-focused, catalyst-driven investment firm that seeks to earn superior risk-adjusted returns uncorrelated to the broader market, announced today that it has published a detailed analysis of AerSale Corporation (NASDAQ:ASLE) (""AerSale"" or ""the Company"") with a Strong Buy recommendation and a near-term price target of $47.13.A copy of Prescience Point's research report on AerSale can be found HERE.Prescience Point believes that AerSale, a leading provider of aftermarket aircraft services and equipment, is one of the most obvious and attractive investments it has ever seen. The Company is projected to grow its adjusted, fully-diluted EPS at a robust CAGR of 231% from FY 2020 to FY 2022. Yet, despite the Company's impressive growth trajectory, its shares are trading at just 10x FY 2022 earnings, while its peers are trading at 25x – 30x. Prescience Point believes AerSale offers immediate upside as several imminent catalysts could result in a more than doubling of its share price within a month. These imminent catalysts include:Expected FAA approval of AerAware, the Company's game-changing wearable head-up display (HUD). Adapted from military-grade fighter jet technology, AerAware will enable commercial airline pilots to see through inclement weather such as snow, rain, sleet and fog. AerSale reached a major milestone in late September by completing the final round of FAA flight testing and related requirements, and its certification work is now essentially finished. Based on prior comments by AerSale management, Prescience Point expects FAA approval should be granted within a few weeks of final flight testing – most likely before mid-November.Prospects of a large launch order for AerAware. Several major airlines, possibly including United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines, are believed to have expressed interest in and flown test flights with AerAware. The airlines' interest reflects AerAware's potential to deliver substantial operational savings by significantly reducing or perhaps even eliminating flight delays and diversions caused by inclement weather. Based on public comments by AerSale management, it appears to be a near certainty that the Company will receive an initial large order from a major airline soon before or immediately after receiving FAA approval, which, as noted above, is expected to occur before mid-November.Potential upward revision to 2021 guidance. Based on AerSale's strong YTD performance, Prescience Point believes the Company will substantially raise its FY 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance when it reports Q3 earnings in early November. Current guidance is $60 million-$70 million, although the Company has already generated $46.9 million of adjusted EBITDA through the first two quarters of the year, including $30.4 million in Q2. AerSale only needs to generate a total of $23.1 million in the 2021 second half to exceed the top-end of its current guidance. Since management disclosed, during its Q2 2021 earnings call, sale commitments for 11 converted 757s, the majority of which will likely be sold by the end of 2021, Prescience Point expects aircraft sales in both Q3 and Q4 will be double the level of Q2. Even with conservative assumptions for the remaining business lines, AerSale thus has the potential to generate $62.4 million of adjusted EBITDA in the second half of FY 2021, and $109.4 million for the full year.Prescience Point projects AerSale will generate $1.08 of adjusted, fully-diluted EPS in FY 2021. Based on conservative projections for the Company's core business, and assuming the delivery of 250 AerAware units to its launch customer in FY 2022, Prescience Point estimates that the Company will generate $1.89 of adjusted, fully-diluted EPS in FY 2022.""Given that AerSale generates higher margins and is growing at a much faster rate than its peers, we believe its shares should, at the very least, trade at a multiple that is in-line with its comparables,"" said Eiad Asbahi, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Prescience Point. ""Based on our projection of $1.89 of adjusted, fully-diluted EPS in FY 2022, and assuming a conservative multiple of 25x, we value AerSale shares at $47.13 today, which represents a 146.5% premium to the current share price of $19.12.""Prescience Point has a long position in shares of AerSale and stands to benefit if the share price rises.About Prescience Point Capital ManagementPrescience Point Capital Management is a research-focused, catalyst-driven investment firm that seeks to earn superior risk-adjusted returns uncorrelated to the broader market.

"It looks like ASLE is filing an S-1 form today. They are giving themselves the right to both issue new shares and also the right to issues shares for the purpose of satisfying previously issued warrants. On the one hand, this is likely dilutive (as any S-1 would be). This could result in short term pressure on both the stock and warrants. On the flip side, if they raising money, that means they have a need for the money, and AerSale remains an excellent recovery play. If aircraft start flying again, the need for maintenance will increase dramatically. Right now, ASLE is preparing for a future where aircraft maintenance is in higher demand. I don't know if the S-1 necessarily changes things a lot. Every SPAC will eventually issue one or more S-1 forms. They must, in order to exercise the warrants. We knew this was coming, but who knows what the short term market reaction will be. You may recall that QS got whacked when they issues their S-1."
ASLE OR ASLEW going forward. Can’t find info on this
"FAA approval will result in multiple contracts with three carriers immediately. Airlines are lining-up for AerSale new low-visibility system. I believe their pending contracts are close to 25% of the total market cap today. $100 stock in 12-months. If you are reading this, you are getting in right at the beginning of this multi-year run."

Since the warrant disclosure, they more than quadrupled. Equity is up since the position was disclosed. It is history’s third best performing deSPACed equity among those with such a high redemption rate (94%). Redeeming holders simply made a terrible mistake with a huge opportunity cost. Today, their equity costs under $14 and is worth $10 per share more. Even as the market awaits verification of its value as a newly standalone public company, it should trade in the $18-24 range. Once it secures FAA approval, their AerAware product launch later this year could represent another $10 per share of value for a $34 per share upside.""This guy knows his stuff. I'm in today 14.60 with a healthy position. GL to us all. May everyone have a very Happy and Prosperous New Year."

"AerSale is ready for takeoff and Mr. Market is sound asleep, this vendor to Boeing is worth $40.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457214-boeing-vendor-aersale-worth-40"
Warrants now well above $5 in premarket trading.
"I hope everyone listed when I posted 6 months ago, but this isn't done yet. FAA approval soon and then sprinkled in deals with Airline companies and then Bam deal with Boeing. I will make another million before this is over."
"@SteveStrike is 11.50 and you can use an option price calculator to determine the worth. You will have to estimate the implied volatility as well as the expiration date (because warrants can be force exercised once the stock clears $18). If we assume one year to expiration, and IV = 38, and interest rate 2% and dividend 0, then you get a price of 2.39 which is about what the warrants are currently trading at. Personally, I think that IV is a little bit high for this stock, meaning that the warrants are bit over-priced. However, worth is in the eye of the beholder. I own some warrants and I and not selling them."
"Recent insight from a highly reputable investor...AerSale has multiple ways to win. The market could give it an industry multiple based on the company's current business mix; that could be a double for the stock in 2021. But what if the market ignores their current business? It could easily double anyways because there are so many embedded options that are ripe for success this coming year. The industry could recover and aircraft servicing is a levered bet on that recovery. Even without a recovery, servicing benefits from the chaos of turning so many passenger planes into cargo planes. And their shareholders get free calls on a range of promising engineered products that could be worth more than the whole rest of the company once the FAA approves them and they hit the market. Stay tuned. Another free call: projections don't include growth from M&A despite a great industry consolidation opportunities. And one more: projections don't include substantial growth from government contracts. But both M&A and government contracts could soon be big growth engines over the next several quarters. By that point, shares are likely to trade in the $18-24 range. That is why this is my top SPAC equity for 2021. Amidst a SPAC boom, this is a true value investment that will stand the test of time."

Love to know what the news is
On board love the P/B ratio I’m long
What f o ols are selling today.. This is going to 20$
Interesting 14.00 might start to add in this range
"I was here a year ago, I'm here today, and I will be here 1 year from now."
"Wow What a bargain at 9.50 these people who selling must be a desperate, or got their shares for free."
Still under valued....
Today is good day.. I owned warrants since 1.15
"Warrants are a pretty good way to own this stock as it would be hard for them to drop much lower. The warrants only cost about two bucks each right now. We are going to need to see some positive news regarding maintenance contracts for this stock to move up. Once the economy starts to recover from COVID, air-traffic related stocks should move up."
"New 52 week high for the warrants, new 6 month high for the stock. Someone knows something."
