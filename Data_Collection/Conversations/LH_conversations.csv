"should be 240 after earnings from ascending formation bounce off of 50 day moving average.One wouldn't think of any kind of short squeeze with only 1.36 million sh short, BUT, this stock has 95%of its outstanding shares owned by Institutions, So 95% of 96.87 float leaves only 4.9m shares left and if 1.36m are shorted that's 28% short and that's alot. This stock could run up very quickly with such a thin float."
"Their customer service is still the worst by a long shot! Benn in the lab biz for 34 years, every customer I know holds their nose when they have to order from Labcorp or Quest!"

Wow fda approved for in home use. This is mucho grande
$119 for the at home swab test. Are you serious?
Covid cases are NOT decreasing and there is not enough to vaccine to kick in herd immunity until at least next spring for the general population. Keep your covid testing stocks ... even on vaccine news for approvals when the testing stocks take a dive buy more because an approved vaccine does NOT eliminate the need for testing and LH and your fav covid test related stocks will likely fare very well IMHO.
Long time holder and would like to see a dividend.Love the stock and would like to see a return on my capital without selling.
This should be well above 190
So a company that does testing for the Virus is down because of a new strain of the Virus. See this makes absolutely no sense!! wow
Hi I bought share at 180. What I should do?. They are keep dropping. Is there any chance they go up?Thanks.
Earnings call coming; this morning’s news...going up 20% from here in the week
Does anyone have a reasonable explanation as to why the Companies picked to supply COVID-19 test kits are all tanking on that news? LH DGX OPK HOLX
Do you know if earnings will be announced before trading or after trading tomorrow. Appreciate anyone's help. The second quarter earnings should be a blow out number to the upside.
Just watch the news. Testing is not an option. It’s an absolute necessity.
My son is a quality control manager at LH in Burlington and loves the thorough research and quality of how the lab techs do their jobs. Great company !
Who thinks earnings will be great ?
Strong Buy!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/labcorp-lh-q1-earnings-revenues-121512936.html
"This stock is being unfairly punished along with the overall market. Read the press release from Labcorp today, they are going to be scaling up to processing 20,000 tests per day just for coronavirus. Business is booming for them yet they are trading like they are an airline company."
This over the counter at home. You get immediate results is a game changer. Sports for kids can test the day of the game
Shouldn't a new strain make this stock rocket up?
"THE BEST NEWS: Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) is the first diagnostic test developer to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market an at-home specimen collection kit for COVID-19. In an April 21 FDA news release, the federal agency announced it had “re-issued the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Laboratory Corporation of America COVID-19 RT-PCR Test to permit testing of samples self-collected by patients at home using LabCorp’s Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 Test home collection kit.”The kit includes a nasal swab for specimen collection and a shipping package for returning the sample to a designated medical laboratory.https://www.darkdaily.com/fda-issues-first-approval-for-at-home-covid-19-test-to-labcorps-pixel-other-clinical-laboratory-developed-at-home-test-kits-may-soon-be-available-to-general-public"
"Antibody testing at home will be huge. Govt and insurance co pay, I hope. Then partner with Amazon and return via kohl’s or UPSDatabase will be built on AWS ?...."
"Earnings report coming tomorrow for $LH. Expecting a blowout quarter, raising the whole sector with it."
"Continuing to stay long, got in at $185, underwater ever since. I can’t see how this can’t do well long term."
"Should be soaring. If a testing type of stock can't in these times, it never will."
I wonder what will happen when more people start going back to work and drug testing becomes a thing again. I know they were able to make up some of the lost profit because of the covid-19 stuff but it should be interesting to see how things play out in the next year or so.
70 mil in awards so far this year from govt. vs. 102 last year total. Running tons of test. Home COVID kit available on website. What you think earnings will be?
Accumulating
"LH are completing Covid-19 testing of between 55,000 to 65,000 per day currently. That’s just the diagnostic side. Think about that!"
How many times do we have to be mentioned at a Presidential Press Meeting before people realize we’re the ones providing all the testing?
"if its FDA approved, why is this going down?"
Testing in Sacramento and elsewhere starts on Monday per SAC BEE article today! MD will collect sample Lab Corp will test.
Very very very nice
"Labcorp and Quest are doing between 50 to 75% of all testing in this country. In may they started doing elective procedures again which means more high dollar lab tests. Quest CEO said they will be profitable just doing Covid tests. They should have some very good earnings this month vs. the much lower expectations! I own Quest, Labcorp and Apple and I have made twice as much off of Quest and Labcorp as I have Apple. Don't understand why these companies get zero respect but I'm loaded up on the Aug., Nov., Dec, and Feb options and buying more on every fallback. Go ahead and buy your 1 in a hundred vaccine stacks, my money is on the real Covid winners in the economy. BTW, I sold Apple last week after being in it for 5 years and I'm up 300% this year and still have 50% cash!"
LH approved for sample pooling. Great !!! This allows several specimens run at the same time to have higher capacity testing for covid ..
If they are doing 50k+ tests per day for virus...shouldn’t their next quarter earnings explode?
Great company. Long time shareholder. Would like to see a split or dividend.
Today up to 172.
"You will see every American be tested, some more than once. 93% of all tests go through 2 large output labs, qwest diagnostics and lab corporation. Do the math and tell me the number"
Up $7 after hours
