I don't buy the idea that gamers will leave because of that harrassment news. FUD

"It had beaten analysts' expectations for its fiscal second quarter earnings results, option traders are taking actions suggesting that they think the share price will move higher in the future. This may come as a mild surprise considering the recent controversy around the company, but the share price did rise 2.12% the day after the earnings announcement."
Diablo 2 Ressurrected beta test 200k live viewers on Twitch. It will be even higher when the game is actually released. The hype is real

How many times does ATVI have to CRUSH earnings before people believe that this company is making great products? Crying about people leaving WoW but failing to mention people are joining too and it is STILL the most played game. This company makes money! And a lot of it!! Ignore the distractions and look at the bottome line. Just a matter of time before this goes over $100 based on the fundamentals from analyst reports. So don't take my word for it.
100$ soon!
My god... is the paint dry yet?
Twitch Viewership: Call of Duty Warzone: 179kApex Legends: 180kThey are approximately even. No more days of Apex having lots more viewers as the uptick from its new season has passed.Meanwhile it may be that either Esports tournaments like the recent Firedog Whiskey event or Call of Duty Vanguard reveal has increased interest in Warzone.
"In a final attempt to get around the Yahoo Auto-ocker.A games website popular has an article.New game from other company possibly has same issue as COD Warzone has had. A company that makes hacks is claiming they can Hack this new game from this other company.If true then I guess this certaintly is an issue that will.impact everyone and not just ATVI. Hopefully, Publishers can defeat these things to make their games fair.Sorry to be vague but only method to try to get the info..out. Really good article to read though."

"I care about the share price tomorrow, any chance we break 90 dollars per share?"
Call of Duty Vanguard reveal event on Twitch gathered 800k live viewers. Seems to be really good and about to become the best selling game of the year again. RIP Battlefield & Halo
Any known catalyst for the BoD buying?
"Call of Duty Warzone Twitch Viewers: 104,000Apex Legends: 75.9kBack to normal. Back to Warzone as king. Only reason Apex was ahead for a week (if even that much) was due to their new season that introduced a new character (Seer) that had to be nerfed because it was overpowered / out of balance with the other character choices."

I get the feeling a big player is pushing a short position.
"This stock will be hitting close to the $90.00 by the Release of ""Diablo 2 Resurrected"" Sept. 24.The negative feedback will soon pass away like it does all companies. ATVI has great financials and cash flow until they release other games. Diablo 4 is going to be one of these game to keep your eyes on."
"Time to bet against the market today, this harassment case doesn't impact the fundamentals of the company imho.With Diablo 2 Ressurected out in september, a lot of 40-50 year-olds will spend some cash to play this game again, even a so-so earnings call today wouldn't be much of a problem.Taking the risk to add some shares."
"Yesterday while playing world of warcraft classic tbc, I asked my guild if they heard that the blizzard president stepped down and an actual mythic wow player was going to become president. Most of the 30 ppl o line didn't even know of any of the news. The gamers are all still playing as if nothing changed. Most people playing the game itself don't care about what happened at the blizzard hq behind closed doors. I play the game because it's fun and I will continue playing it for another 15 years."
"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/morgan-stanley-names-activision-blizzard-a-top-pick-outside-of-faang-names.htmlMorgan Stanley names Activision a top tech pick outside of FANG names, predicts a nearly 50% rally. Maybe this will goose it higher."
"ZNGA, tremendous buying opportunity."
"At some point I'll invest in this company again. I believe they will get stuff cleaned up. However, I'm not investing a dime until I see the recurring subscription numbers.... this is not the bottom."
"Buy around Activision releases or announcements. Nothing coming out of blizzard unless it's outsourced or half-baked. And if PR can't do a better job it will fall til something positive comes out note worthy. Overwatch is a mess, expecting a reforged like launch from Diablo 2.If they rush Diablo 4 along with CoD stuff that would be my time to jump in. otherwise I'm sitting back watching the dip and waiting."
As of July 2021:Final Fantasy 14 has over 27 million monthly subscribers.World.of Warcraft has over 115 million monthly subscribers.This data was.found doing a search on Bing search engine.It is from MMO Population website.
Wow.. and on NO news.
"As a former Warcraft player, CEO Bobby Kotick is the guy I'd like see being shown the door. He did a great job ruining everything fun and enjoyable about the game through the business strategy of greed and the people he appointed to shift game development in that direction. Sure, they made a fortune doing it but at what long-term price? I stopped playing and sending them my money several years ago due to the shift in game philosophy and content. I'd go back in a heartbeat if Kotick and his developer team of raid centrics were removed."
"Round trip here I come. Not worried at all though. Buying opportunity below 80. Gamers do not care about news. They don't watch the news. They play video games. Honestly I hope we go into the 60's so I can add even more. Fair value is 100 in my opinion, and fair value at 120 next year. So if they get this into the 60's you can essentially double your money in a year. That is how the market works. Just make sure to stick to the plan of buying more if it does down."
"Not yet an upward trend until closing orice of $85+ in my opinion, but loving the action here nonetheless.Why the move up? Simple. Call of Duty Vanguard reveal."
"10,000 calls have been bought today for ATVI to 87 by next Friday. We're down 21% from the 52 week high. Low PE multiple. Strong beat/raise quarter. Powerful fundamentals, big cash position, low margin. 83~ has to be the bottom. This is where you want to initiate a long position in the stock."
