"They have 9 billion in cash. That alone is $12,25 per share. Then add in all the IPs, patents & assets they have + stable cash flow from the current and upcoming games. Extrenely undervalued. Also if you look at the twitch viewer numbers this drama has not affected to any ATVI games. Still same amount of streamers and viewers as before."
"Is there a bear case for this company? Fair valuation, incredible growth, beloved IP, inflation proof… I can’t think of a reason why someone wouldn’t buy."
Anyone in the right mind would be LOADING up on shares right now.
Fantastic buying op
"ignore all bashers, forget all bearish scenarios, we are part of the one of the best companies of the world, as a gamer I love their games, as an investor this is the best moment making huge money by shares and call options, large caps like this are GEM, and forget those lawsuits, smart money don't give a sh, so do I, GL"
Dropped two dollar right after the open
Warzone is dead lmao - they used monthly active user data when there were no hackers. Hackers have since ruined Warzone and everyone is leaving to Apex/ Battlefield.Good luck to those banking on Warzone revenues in Q4
"When blue chip, industry leading stocks are trading at 25X p/e in high growth industries on bad temporary news. YOU BUY THE EFFIN DIP.Meat balls."
"Reading through the lawsuit, this company is going to fall in an orderly fashion. The utterly disgusting workplace encompassed at Activision is simply horrifying, and cannot be transitioned to a better & fair workplace without a change in management, even at the executive level.Love their products, but let's be honest, this stock is going to be in a downward trend for a good while now. Time to short it."
"FYI:$ATVI, Call options Strike 92.5$, Sep 17th 2021.Ver nice set-up, before earning. huge profit"
I have one thing to say…. You’re fired
"This stock will be hitting close to the $90.00 by the Release of ""Diablo 2 Resurrected"" Sept. 24.The negative feedback will soon pass away like it does all companies. ATVI has great financials and cash flow until they release other games. Diablo 4 is going to be one of these game to keep your eyes on."
"Sold half, I hope they get their act together."
"A tech company with dividend,profit,a customer base and a reasonable P/EYes,yes,yes."
"In a final attempt to get around the Yahoo Auto-ocker.A games website popular has an article.New game from other company possibly has same issue as COD Warzone has had. A company that makes hacks is claiming they can Hack this new game from this other company.If true then I guess this certaintly is an issue that will.impact everyone and not just ATVI. Hopefully, Publishers can defeat these things to make their games fair.Sorry to be vague but only method to try to get the info..out. Really good article to read though."
"Sell.off due to CHINA crackdown. This impacts heavily Call.of Duty Mobile. But, it isn't the end of the world. Bobby Kotick will have to fashion a new strategy for growth takong into account that China may be a road to nowhere. ATVI has a ton of cash on the balance sheet and plenty capable of findong growth without China. It just may be slower growth until things change again. But, Diablo 4 is going to break records in my opinion for sales and so sticking with ATVI for Diablo 4."

ATVI one of Goldman's 32 picks.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-goldman-sachs-thinks-these-32-stocks-are-very-attractive-165455513.html
"Huge buying.opportunity. I was planning on accumulating shares of another one of my investments, but I will be buying more ATVI at some point this week. Anytime you have a firestorm of some kind, you buy buy buy. For example, Warren Buffet bought into a credit card company at the start of a major scandal/problem with customers. Everyone sold out of it dropping the price to historic lows. Warren Buffet did the opposite, bought up shares and held waiting for the firestorm to pass. Once it passed the stock proceeded to recover and eventually reach historic highs.The fundamentals haven't changed. The games set.to release in a year or teo are going to be huge successful and I will be buying them and playing them myself and enjpying the heck out of them. I can't wait to play Overwatch 2, Diablo immortal and Diablo 4. I can't wait to see what ATVI has in store for Playstation 5 in the years to come. Internal company issues will sort themselves out. Look at TESLA and their history of issues with cars catching fire or problems with self autonomous driving. Yet TESLA remained a hot stock to buy."
I hope blizzard loses the lawsuit
Hard to prove any kind of harassment claims. Probably just a good opportunity to buy and hold. Despite the quality of the games they still sell and people buy a new game every year.
"I am a gamer. just about every streamer has a ""wow is losing customers to FFXIV"" stream"
TTWO and EA closing up 2% while atvi is closing in the red. I have seen enough. Congrats I am no longer long. Best of luck to those trying to survive this stupidity. Who knows.. may be more trouble here then they are admitting to the public. They hid it from us in the first place. They make great games but apparently they don't know how to run a business.
When this stock gets above $83 it's going to explode to $88.

"Activision CoD is doing amazing but all there other games are dying fast. WoW is almost nonexistent, lost respect with almost all there loyal player base, I see bad earnings ahead when CoD hype dies down and when WoW is fully dead."
Why high volume ? Why are people supporting this company ?
"Buy around Activision releases or announcements. Nothing coming out of blizzard unless it's outsourced or half-baked. And if PR can't do a better job it will fall til something positive comes out note worthy. Overwatch is a mess, expecting a reforged like launch from Diablo 2.If they rush Diablo 4 along with CoD stuff that would be my time to jump in. otherwise I'm sitting back watching the dip and waiting."
"Down a MAU from last quarter, and back to the MAU of 2016 — prior to Overwatch’s release and during the content draught of WoD. Consumers are leaving. The only IP carrying any future promise is CoD."
"I am very uncertain about this company's long-term success and execution. The quality of their games over the past 2 years has been atrocious, and clearly their work culture is in shambles. Quality employees are likely to leave and streamers are less likely to support their games now due to reputation risk."
nice after hours action
Diablo 2 Ressurrected beta test 200k live viewers on Twitch. It will be even higher when the game is actually released. The hype is real
Are you buying or selling today.
I just withdraw my profit two days ago. I'm glad I did invest with him still reinvested and trade is ongoing.
"Earnings tomorrow and I expect ATVI to crush expectations again. ATVI has the best games on the market. I am SHOCKED at the crazy reaction over sexual harassment. Just how and why does this change earnings? McDonalds, Google, Fox News, UPS, Targe, Coca-Cola.. I could go on and on and on. Hard to name a company that has not had charges of Sex Harassment. But I don't believe any of these companies have taken the beating ATVI has over such a trivial matter. Let the courts settle it and pay the bill.. learn and move on. The reaction here is like this company is going out of business. Just crazy."
As of July 2021:Final Fantasy 14 has over 27 million monthly subscribers.World.of Warcraft has over 115 million monthly subscribers.This data was.found doing a search on Bing search engine.It is from MMO Population website.
100$ soon!
"What’s next??? Now that the Virus is gone (Bobby Kotick). This should Hire a Woman CEO. I don’t mean to be one sided. But it will be a, good look if the company has women’s leadership role there. Qualities we want to see in a CEO:• Must be able to show Empathy • Outgoing• Skill full• They MUST have a PASSION for running a business . • Understands the importance of mental health. ACTIVISION has gotten Bitten. How can we heal this snake bite ??? Let’s make ACTIVISION the place we (investors) want to work in. Let’s do #better from now on."
"ATVI has become the new ""Sin Stock"". Blizzard actively lets harassment happen and has caused a female employee to ""commit die"" after sharing lewd pictures of said employee to other male co-workers. She tragically took her life.This likely won't go anywhere and is something people need to seriously consider when buying this stock. The lawsuit is by a STATE not a person... or another person... A STATE! State's normally don't do anything unless they are 100% certain they can win or have backup.Now saying this some people might not care (hell I want to buy ATVI but I feel it can drop a little lower... maybe back to $81 before running. But consider this:- Blizzard's WOW (World Of Warcraft) is BLEEDING players that are running to Final Fantasy 14 (Large youtubers that bring thousands of players with them are leaving and taking their fans with them)- Game Quality is drastically dropping. This isn't a big deal COD will still sell. There is no arguing... but what about the rest? Blizzard has little to 0 use at this point aside from being a pain in Activision's side. Overwatch 2? Delayed, Diablo Remastered? Delayed, Diablo 4? Delayed, WOW? Bleeding players.Seriously consider this when buying this company. I've done my own DD and feel like this company has potential... ONLY on the COD side. Blizzard brings value but its quickly draining that..."
Sad to watch the alphabet people kill this company. All over someone's definition of fairness. They will all loose in the end.
LET IT FOLLOW RBLX today
Vanguard and Blackrock are holding at $93. This stock is 90% institution owned. That is an incredible number. This is a buy and hold and some.

"It’s ready to fly, technically it hit 200MA and rejected by high volume that is very bullish, chart looks good and earning will have surprise"
"I think the CEO's resignation is weighing this down from any upside gain. Continues to reject newer highs. So much selling pressure today. Massive orders on level 2. Many lots of 50,000 shares going through on the sell-side this is banks and institutions selling."
"EA reports great earnings. EA is up $5 in after hours. ATVI announces GREAT EARNINGS. ATVI was up $% in afterhours yesterday. If EA goes up $5 or more today, then this is total manipulation on ATVI's stock. I know the market was down yesterday, but ATVI should have been up $5 yesterday based on future guidance. Future guidance is what nailed TTWO. Lawsuit was totally overblown. This happens all the time at Amazon ,Google and other companies. EARNINGS and EPS were great and so was future guidance. ATVI guides conservatively and then beats . LONG ATVI since 2006."
They had some interesting insights about ATVI on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Nice ATVI jumping in reaction to awesome earnings. So much for the ""what was it again??? I can't remember.... oh yea Sexual Harassment thing we are supposed to get all perpetually worked up over""."
im glad i sold it last year at $77 and move on to other stocks.. Overvalue
"I just checked Twitch and get this:World of Warcraft Shadowlands viewers over 40,000Amazon's new game in Beta called New World: 880That is it. I have been tracking a steady decline in viewership with New World over the past few days. Now it has tanked to just 880 viewers.According to critiques that said they liked New World, they nonetheless voiced big concerns over the clunky combat and animations. If you can't get combat right in a Fantasy Middle Ages style MMO role playing Gane you are done for. No chance of success if the main thing you do in these games ia clunky and not fun.Amazon has the budget development houses could only dream.of having and yet they have yet to make a successful game. New World runs the risk of vaporware status...Shadowlands has the record in most sales ever for a title and still geta lots of viewership on Twitch and lots of subscribers. It is perhaps the most successful MMO expansion ever."
Monster earnings.
throwing my shirt now
This will make a nice short if you?re into that. There?s more downside coming in my opinion. Blizzard has #$%$ off too many customers and it?s not about the harassment issue.
multiple harrassment lawsuits will cost 100s of millions to their bottom line. Puts.
"Expecting 70-75 in the short term, I dont think good numbers will matter in this report, the market is always thinking ahead and this is shouldnt be an exception. Losing players to FF, New Order and (probably) Riot's upcoming MMO, the scandal going on, no work being done on WoW atm... This report might be good but the market is already thinking about the next report, and thats what a few of you don't really seem to get. But if I'm wrong I hope Blizzy comes out stronger than ever and that they've learned something from all of this, since they've made some of my absolute favorite games."
Its time to eliminate the rebellious elements at Blizzard and move 1500 jobs to India and Sri Lanka.Replace the entitled and privileged nuissances with some loyal employees that will glady give their lives for 150-200 dollars a month.Its time to bring up the profit margin.
"Diablo 2 Remastered Q3 release, Next Modern Warfare release in Q4 2020, Diablo 4 also in pipeline... This isn't dropping anytime soon. Also the change up in Activision management by axing J. Allen Brack is exactly what Blizz needs to shake up their inefficient development of titles. Loading up on his discount from bad PR."
Next target is 87$ and then 89$. GL
Screaming buy at $70.
Waiting for higher gap tommorrow when market open.
We better have a really good report next week or the social factors will hit hard.
keep it coming i still got the upvotes
This will go down to around $75-$77. Absolutely no support. And we all know their either gunna somehow remove this from media or pay the victims to hush. Predictable move. I’m pretty sure this company breaks the constitution law of pursuit of happiness .... No one should have to avoid bathrooms at a safe work environment. Bad managed company+ unhappy employees + bad production resulting in unhappy customers. When you invest in a company make sure you would wanna work there yourself lmfao. News like this is NOT okay. Do better.
"People, if you think this is a buying opportunity, you are nuts. This is going to lead to a hot mess of change management in the organization and many, many people will leave. This is is 20% - 30% bomb drop at a minimum. They will be the scourge of gaming for a while. If you own, you may want to jump out of the ship quickly, trying the hold strategy is going to be be very risky, and it could take you 5 years to get back pre-scandal"
I’m def interested in getting in on these prices where do you think it’s gonna drop to?
Going to cut my stake by half as suggested by Jim Cramer.
"Predatory monetization and environment will not let this company grow as it could. I am definitely not supporting the company. I got ripped off enough. Activision Blizzard needs to rebuild their PR and new good game or expansion. Still, they are pricing their products way over it's potential value. At certain point more means less and all of this backfires. It already started backfiring. Once top content makers leave and Activision Blizzard is making sure that they do leave (for example disclosure that everything you make in Warcraft 3 Reforged map editor belongs to Acti Blizzard). I see it as Titanic and it will slowly but surely sink."
"It's going down, get out while you can. Rebuy later if you still want to support this. Earnings next week will probably be BAD.Don't like the stock? Short it. Like it? Sell and rebuy!"
I wish Yahoo would remove Accesswire and Newswire from it's feed so we can get actual analysis instead of law firm advertisements. Neither of them ever have anything of worth to an investor and just junk up the page.
To the Elune!
"Citi upgrades Activision-Blizzard, says it’s time to buy the dip in the video game stockPublished Fri, Aug 13 20215:58 AM EDTUpdated 2 Hours Ago"
Lawsuit? Time to short.
This company is done. I can see it dropping down to $20s if not filing for Chapter 7. They got woke! Don't mess with us.
"Remember a little while back when employees were disgruntled because they didn’t think ATVI was paying enough??? What happened??? Very little. Some left, and were quickly replaced. Earnings will be great. Innocent until proven guilty. LONG ATVI"
Whoever is driving this rocket ship.. easy.. we are fine with going up $5 a week.
"what a dog of a stock, held it for a year and it went no where except from the beginning. and now going down due to recent news. disappoint on this one"
VOLUME IS EXCELLENT. Share price will come back . Long ATVI
Would buy in if I could. I allready sitting on tons of it and not selling until $100+.
"I should have bought more, but its all good."
Thumbs up if 83 is the bottom. Thumbs down if 83 is the top.
This stock has been a major disappointment YTD. Need a catalyst for this rocket to take off 
"ATVI should be $103. Where it was in Jan/21. Truly, BEST IN CLASS. Superb MANAGEMENT."
Just watch the grind higher to 100
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Fairstox.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
All time highs by mid next week. Lawsuits dropped and PE low.
A lot of bag holders here!!! Company hasn't released a game worth playing since 2010.
"This is a great opportunity for some massive layoffs of rebellious staff.Get rid of a good 1000 or 1200 problematic characters and open a couple of warehouses in Sri Lanka and/or India. For 200 dollars a month people are willing to kill and will happily work 15 hrs a day, 6 days a week and half a day on Sundays.Profit margin will slyrocket after a couple of quarters.Short term price target: 701 yr price target: 175"
"Tonight ATVI will smooth everything over by announcing a mobile version of Small World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Remastered, with 4k resolutions and enhanced audio/visuals."
People don't seem to understand CEO resignation means insider stock sales incoming
So China rescinded its news about the video game crackdown.
Be carefulShorts are gonna be all over this until upper management steps down!They should have stepped down already as they have a duty to the shareholders
"Like i said many times and got many negative commends, the true story we will see in next few Q. Dont be suprise if earnings drop/ dont be suprise if catalyst change. More and more bad newa are coming, if they manage to turn thinks arround then i belive company will be worth 100 dolars, but dont be suprise if this go back to 50, dont be suprise if earnings will come really bad in next few Q, dont be suprise that many games will be delayed. This will make stock plummet. Do your risk managment i put this in your perspective. Risk/reward right now i think there is bigger chance that stock go down then up, but if you are long term then dont need to worry about it, expect if thinks get bad. I decided not to short it, becouse i am always positive that everything will be ok."
"More power to the employees standing up to corp mistreatment of women.... To bad wall street didn't send the same message and dump the stock. That's the only way this message will truly hit home. No place for this kind of treatment in any company, small, large, public or not."
"Oh. Those ""woke"" people really did a number on Activision. Look how much it is plummeting in pre-market. Hey ""woke"" I have a few other companies that I'm invested in that I would appreciate if you could do the same to them."
I heard about ATVI the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I don't buy the idea that gamers will leave because of that harrassment news. FUD
I am glad I sold 80% of my position last week. Management must really be tone deaf given the outrageous salaries and the work conditions. I hope the board takes quick action but the effects of this problem will be more than short term.
just preordered diablo 4
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Multistockalerts.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"I care about the share price tomorrow, any chance we break 90 dollars per share?"
"It had beaten analysts' expectations for its fiscal second quarter earnings results, option traders are taking actions suggesting that they think the share price will move higher in the future. This may come as a mild surprise considering the recent controversy around the company, but the share price did rise 2.12% the day after the earnings announcement."
"If you think today is bad, wait until diablo immortal and warcraft patch updates start getting delayed due to employee strikes."
Must be something amazing brewing at Activision Blizzard given the sudden numbers of shills showing up here.
Need to find a law firm? Just log onto Yahoo Finance ATVI chart and scroll down. There are more law firms listed than human beings on Planet Earth.
Earnings in two weeks. You will see ATVI crush earnings expectations again. No idea why the stock is lagging but I am all in.
Huge sell. Girl committed suicide during a Work Trip.. The harassment is bad at Blizzard
more discount
Sad that there is no news about this company. Only law firm advertising.
"I won't speak for the future of this company, but I will about its short term. Many in the gaming industry have woken up and realize that these huge companies that bring loved games do have a much horrible side, EA helped start this, Activision is just one of many who will show its true colors. This company, at least short term, it will go down in value. It has received extremely bad rep, even when the CEO and those up high have tried to stopped it by asking friends to go long, but only temp. If you want to cash out, Short would be the advisable thing to do right now. You could buy now that is low, but then again, that's just missing out on a giving Opportunity. Short, then when you make your play buy when is really low."
The one thing that no one expected was the stock to fall 10% last week due to the Sexual issues and history proves that those types of events are one off and will be forgotten about IMHO sooner than later and that really does not effect earnings..... So is most of the downside if they have something bad in the ER already baked in?
Weird... sex lawsuit and the stock goes up? Who knew a company with BILLIONS in the bank and crushing earnings quarter after quarter would grow in value? Did you know ATVI makes the best games? I have played them all and NOTHING is as nice. WoW STILL has MILLIONS of players (and #1 by A LOT in MMORPG) and for a good reason and that isn't even their best game! PLEASE SHORT THIS STOCK! ROFL'
Where are the Naysayers? Awfully silent in the after hours here or did I mute them all?
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Roblox misses revenues leaving ATVI as the only worthwhile inveatment for video game publishing.Diablo 2 Beta was a great success. Mostly saw positive feedback from Twitch watchers and streamers. That releases in about a month and will jump start Blizzard as they release more Diablo games in the coming months (Diablo Immortal for example).
My god... is the paint dry yet?
"Raven Software reports this morning with a Tweet that Call.of Duty Warzone Anti-Cheat info is coming soon. Also, a patch was scheduled to be released today.... I believe for Warzone but not sure if it is Cold War instead... Delayed to tomorrow it looks like. Glad to see the developer was never asleep on this issue but working hard behind the scenes to address this."
Short squeeze today.$88+ incoming.Thanks Bobby.
"Time to bet against the market today, this harassment case doesn't impact the fundamentals of the company imho.With Diablo 2 Ressurected out in september, a lot of 40-50 year-olds will spend some cash to play this game again, even a so-so earnings call today wouldn't be much of a problem.Taking the risk to add some shares."
"Yesterday while playing world of warcraft classic tbc, I asked my guild if they heard that the blizzard president stepped down and an actual mythic wow player was going to become president. Most of the 30 ppl o line didn't even know of any of the news. The gamers are all still playing as if nothing changed. Most people playing the game itself don't care about what happened at the blizzard hq behind closed doors. I play the game because it's fun and I will continue playing it for another 15 years."
"Their IP, especially WoW, imo has been impaired. They really need to just scrap it after Shadowlands and make Warcraft 4 with WoW 2.0 to follow - otherwise this MAU bleeding is going to continue."
I'm still addicted to hearthstone and give them all my money
Expect this to trade Higher this week. We should see $83.00 maybe even Higher.
Great to see the Moderators are siding with short sellers and blocking my posts here.
As I have been saying... CRUSHED earnings expectations and they will continue to do that. Now lets move on! I want my $100!!
Twitch Viewership: Call of Duty Warzone: 179kApex Legends: 180kThey are approximately even. No more days of Apex having lots more viewers as the uptick from its new season has passed.Meanwhile it may be that either Esports tournaments like the recent Firedog Whiskey event or Call of Duty Vanguard reveal has increased interest in Warzone.
I hold it at least Diablo4 & immortal. it is the best game i played.
Grateful for the money I made on puts on this company. Despite the incel who harassed me on this board over it.Market really didn’t care about lawsuits in the end. Workers protesting and walking out? That did the trickSwitched to calls yesterday. It’s all up here from here.
You naysayers were around between Oct/2018 to Dec /2019. Stock won’t go anywhere!! Get out while you can !!! ALL OF YOU WERE WRONG. This will pass. LONG ATVI SINCE 2006.
"26M MAU... down 1M from last quarter despite the launch of patch 9.1, and TBC Classic. Unless they can turn around the current trajectory, Wows MAUs are going to continue dropping"
"As reported by Daniel Howley:Video game giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI) reported its second quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines.Back to the $100s we go!Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.Revenue: $1.92 billion versus $1.89 billion expected.Earnings per share: $0.91 versus $0.75 expected.Activision Blizzard is also calling for revenue of $1.85 billion in Q3 2020, outpacing analysts' expectations of $1.79 billion for the coming quarter, though earnings per share are expected to be $0.65 compared to expectations of $0.75."
"I know gamers. They could not care less about sexual harassment or a toxic work environment. Frankly, some of them probably wish they could work in a place that let's you harass women and get away with it.Drop the new Call of Duty or Overwatch 2, and it'll all be water under the bridge.It's sad actually, but none of my business. Just here to make money. Excited to see what the calls I bought today will look like in the morning."
bought more on dip
"Not yet an upward trend until closing orice of $85+ in my opinion, but loving the action here nonetheless.Why the move up? Simple. Call of Duty Vanguard reveal."
Earnings will be spectacular. The trend is up. Ignore the whiny basement dwellers who can't beat level 1 in life.
"MoffettNathanson Starts Activision Blizzard at Buy With $124 Price Target, Says Blizzard Segment 'Poised for a Renaissance'BY MT Newswires— 6:38 AM ET 06/24/2021"
Lol just nonsense...100 dollar stock for 80s as some lawsuit ...fire those and move on ... company didn't stop making money ..buy the discount I did.
"The gaming industry is in a transitioning phase right now, and gaming stocks have been down since the pandemic has been wrapping up. However, Activision has some upcoming games for 2022 that are gonna generate a lot of revenue and attention. Don't forget the bigger picture here: The gaming industry is expected to grow about 10% per year over the next 5 years, and Activision has had some of the most recognizable and steady games in an unpredictable and volatile industry."
They should hire Sylvanas Windrunner to replace Bobby the Tick as CEO of Activision Blizzard. She checks all the boxes and would be the perfect 'woke' candidate to lead this company.
"No debt, 6bil in net cash. Very high margin and keeps improving"
"lmao more top talent let go at Blizz.""Diablo 4 game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and World of Warcraft designer Jonathan LeCraft were let go from Blizzard on Wednesday"""
"expanded lawsuit just another wallstreet hatchet job. when is the bottom, ill buy more."
"Got some aug 20 77.5 puts, who knows, the damage over time could increase. Other people might start speaking out too.Don't see it falling lower than 70 and as many mentioned, it'll probably rebound later or not fall more at all due to fundamentals"
"Insider Trends: Insider Purchase Adds to Activision Blizzard Positive TrendBY MT Newswires— 7:05 PM ET 08/09/202107:05 PM EDT, 08/09/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Peter J Nolan, Director, purchased 20,765 shares in Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ) on Aug 05, 2021, for $1,677,320. Following the Form 4 filing with the SEC, Nolan controls 218,169 shares of company stock of which 87,062 shares are held directly and 131,107 are owned indirectly. These holdings have an approximate market value of $17.98 million as of the prior-day closing price."
Blizzard games are starting to suck. They took 15 years to make a new Diablo and it's no better then Nintendo graphics. It's going downhill. Call of duty is old with nothing new. Same with WOW. Plus this lawsuit now. Goodbye atvi.
Activision has some massive projects in the works over the next 2-3 years. Don't let a short-term scandal scare you away from one of the strongest names in the gaming industry.
Activision's Lawyers preparing for court:
"As a former Warcraft player, CEO Bobby Kotick is the guy I'd like see being shown the door. He did a great job ruining everything fun and enjoyable about the game through the business strategy of greed and the people he appointed to shift game development in that direction. Sure, they made a fortune doing it but at what long-term price? I stopped playing and sending them my money several years ago due to the shift in game philosophy and content. I'd go back in a heartbeat if Kotick and his developer team of raid centrics were removed."
Shorted at 83.75. Gonna ride all the way to zero!
Here was managements reaction to the Hundreds of people who showed up Wednesday outside an office of Activision Blizzard Inc. in Southern California to demonstrate their support of a sexual harassment lawsuit and to protest the video game maker’s insufficient response.
Possibly one of the worst products I’ve ever used. Hilarious that the corporate end is just as bad 
"What a croc!!! I don’t know if ATVI will miss the next quarter guidance, but I do know they have some of the best games and MANAGEMENT. ATVI is great in free to play and ESPORTS. I’m looking forward to a solid last quarter. Third quarter is always the slowest before they release the new COD. Lawsuits like these happen all the time and in most big companies. Time will tell. LONG ATVI since 2006"
"can't wait for an investigation then news to follow that activision has allowed hacking in call of duty warzone to increase player base , popularity, and in game purchases to artificially inflate stock price. Activision employee sold source code. Activision has known this since 2020 but allowed it due to the billion $ in revenue generated from the games in all purchases. Activision is involved in fraud and stock manipulation. 2 months till halo drops as well as Electronic arts battlefield. short this bad boy hard over the next 5 months. this is your warning when you all cry and say why didn't anyone tell us"
"Call of Duty Warzone Twitch Viewers: 104,000Apex Legends: 75.9kBack to normal. Back to Warzone as king. Only reason Apex was ahead for a week (if even that much) was due to their new season that introduced a new character (Seer) that had to be nerfed because it was overpowered / out of balance with the other character choices."

"what a dog of a stock...never went anywhere, but return to the same or under in a year span"
I hope and expect the brains will calculate the cost of the metoo issue and realize it is minor compared to the constant earnings beats and the BILLIONS in cash. Oh.. and do not forget they have some pretty amazing products coming out in less then a year. Seriously.. this company is BOOMING!! BUY BUY BUY!!!
"It’s going to 86-87 end of this week, and 100$ before September"
Solid earnings. However All 3 divisions down on previous quarter MAUs. They are losing players.
"days like today and the past week make you thank God there's a thing called Emotions causing these wonderful buy points for us to get into THE best gaming stock there is right now. Like a chipotle's food scare, a few years ago, the allegations against people at Blizzard is small and won't disrupt what all of the segments at ATVI do. Thank you sellers. Bought shares at 78.85 and gotta love that post-market bump. we should see a return to 90+ real soon. use your pre-frontal cortex (logic), no one should be selling ATVI shares, but hey, I'm not complaining."
New leader coming soon! New culture! Amazing earnings! No reason not to buy.
"I sold mine on July 15, about a week before the lawsuit hit. I do not plan to reinvest unless its not just words, but action as well."
Any known catalyst for the BoD buying?
Earnings reports are in from the video gaming companies and i believe ATVI is the CLEAR winner. As many of us have been saying.. ATVI makes the absolute best games in the business because they have the best programmers. That is just the bottom line. Focus on this and make money as this stock has NO business selling at this price.
"Very weak stock today fails VWAP and $82. I'm long $80.85 with over $70,000 worth of shares. Earnings were great but certain stocks have been hammered."
"buy the dip, this is best opportunity before earnings, no one give a sh to these kind of lawsuits,"
Wow.. and on NO news.
An Evil company doing Evil things. Evil is what you support when you support companies like this. Walmart is just as bad.
Google research sexual harassment lawsuits. Most companies experience them and them and the video game industry is ground zero. Settlment will cost millions and is just part of doing business and needs to be addressed. Great opportunity to buy again as it is a minor distraction to a company sitting on about 10 BILLION in cash. But please short the stock.. and while your at it short google that had a similar lawsuit or better yet short all stocks with sexual harassment lawsuits.
bought at 91 - will set another buy at 78.80
Imagine the nasdaq reaching ATH and your company still being in the red.
Somehow the news just keeps getting worse...https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762
"I can't believe that with people leaving World of Warcraft in large numbers and the class action lawsuits, that this stock is not taking a nose dive.."
"With the lack of new toys and distribution/supply chain problems in China, ATVI should have massive success with content and new game downloads. It’s looking like a very merry Christmas for ATVI!!!!"
"People forget that Activision Blizzard for many years in row has been chosen to be one of THE BEST employer in the USA. Fortune, Glassdoor, Great Place To Work Institute etc. have all rated it to be top100 places to work. The rating is based on former and current employee experiences so they wouldn't have been nominated if the lawsuit accusations were correct. Why would some accusations from 5-10 years ago ruin the reputation of this company anyway? Besides the guy who was accused has been fired already. It is still great place to work without any harassment. This Blizzard hate bandwagon will be forgotten in 2 weeks."
Love these fake journalist smearing companies with tabloids. Creates perfect buying opportunities!

"According to a senior developer at Activision Blizzard, practically all work on World of Warcraft has been halted by a lawsuit regarding sexual harassment, bullying, unfair pay, and more. $65 incoming"
looks like no one cares about the scandal anymore. picking these up at 79 was highway robbery.

Any normal shareholder knows that the lawsuit accusations were a poor excuse to send this great company stock down $11. Long ATVI since 2006.
all the headlines about disappointment.. but stock price doesn't care.
"Sorry bears, 6billion lost in market cap over a lawsuit isn't going to last."
"isn't just an Activision problem, this is industry wide, grandma's boy really isn't that inaccurate of a representation"
So much fuss about jokes?
I probably missed the Vanguard event but as of right now 749k viewers of Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch.Top streamer pro Tim the Tatman had 121k viewers.
A weekly reversal could be in play if we close over $84 on friday
Anybody know what is happening at Activision Blizzard today? Walkout?
"People do realize that this was a 2 year police investigation and not a SJW lawsuit, right?"
how much more of a beating do we think the news cycle will cause here? looking for a bottom to buy in
pretty good setup for a bounce
"Hey, Otter, I'm getting back in. I think there's a trade to be had here for a bounce. It's way oversold."
I got a source that tells me the lawsuit will be for 500 billion dollars.Get out now
"The sheer amount of law firms infesting this situation is unbelievable. I am not trying to diminish or take anything away from the justice that the leaders have to pay for, but this is absurd. What a bunch of mosquitoes..."
"Activision is going to have to start purging certain employees. Afterall you can balance things out also be deleting certain people. Of course there are less woment, trans, etc... in a stem related field. They should just start cutting pay until everyone is equal.... lol. The company is getting what they deserve. They actually believe most of the political woke themes they push in their games. And now they will eat their own. At this point they either start laying certain people off or this will only build until the company comes crashing down. I'm neutral leaning towards underperform."
Too many people are focused on the short term. Big investors aren’t going to care about the lawsuits and noise. Fundamentals will drive this company in the long run.
In regards to the ongoing Case against Blizzard - States rarely take cases to court unless they are certain they will win. For a state that has only one year of budget surplus in over 10+ years (?) it really isn’t feasible to think that they would waste money on frivolous lawsuits against wealthy corporations.Any fines assessed to Blizzard as a result of this case would be insignificant to CA’s operating budgets so there is no financial motivation for this case to be brought by the state.
I have not yet gotten my dividend that was suppose to come August 6th. Anyone else had the same problem?
"I posted day ago saying that blizzard is not in good shape and got multiple screaming at me how i have no idea what i am saying, how this is a buy and bla bla. I warn you to be carefull, i told you why this is risky and now you have a huge problem and when important people start leaving the company you should start seeing red flags. Meaby i was right about shorting this, we will see."
"I sold yesterday into the rally. I did take a loss. My issue is that until the negative headlines ease up, any rallies will be sold into. Fundamentals don't matter at this time for ATVI. GLTA"
"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/morgan-stanley-names-activision-blizzard-a-top-pick-outside-of-faang-names.htmlMorgan Stanley names Activision a top tech pick outside of FANG names, predicts a nearly 50% rally. Maybe this will goose it higher."
"it's going up, 5% should be good for tomorrow."
Why the big drop?
"It might be too little, too late."
woke employees running the company into the ground. good luck with that
"I've been attempting to keep up with the recent news with this stock, but I'm just getting more and more confused. Anyone care to explain? What is going on with the whole shareholder voting and the union resistance towards the CEO? Didn't he get a reduction in salary that went towards the bottom portion of employees in the company? Also, it looked like the share price started to rise after the new WOW was released AND the new Diablo 2 resurrected was announced. Why are we seeing this big decline despite such quality content being released? I heard some stuff with the new Chinese regulations giving some small issues with releasing games there, but nothing surely not so impactful as a 2-4% drop in price?"
"Just get it below $85, and we can use some of those earnings to buy the girls Edible Arrangements."
"I dont think so you guys really understand what is happening. Data is suggesting huge exodus of players in there biggest game WOW, no1 wanna work for blizard anymore, people are done. I am telling yoh this could be a nice short, this Q you will not see the damage but next Q, trust me you will see how much they lost. I am warning you, this will not follow the normal projectory of stock going up, meaby i am wrong but for sure i will not risk my money at this stage. The hate is getting worst and worst."
Amazing how this stock has been about the biggest pandemic disappointment.
"I love it! While some are selling half their shares, I am buying. While some trust Jim Cramer who as far as I can tell is NOT a video game sector expert at all (does he even play video games???), I am buying. ATVI to the moon. Best video game franchises bar none. Best gameplay.The population of gamers should not be pigeon holed to United States only or even North America. ATVI franchises are played globally. Short sellers don't want you to know about that.I am super excited for Overwatch 2 as I loved the trailer for the single player mode. The single player campaign for Overwatch 2 is essentially introducing a new IP as no single player campaign existed in Overwatch 1. Call of Duty Warzone continues to be super successful as well as Call of Duty Mobile.The best video game developers are with ATVI period.I am looking forward to Diablo 2 Remaster coming later this year as I already preordered it awhile ago.I couldn't be anymore bullish on ATVI than I am right now. And hey, it is my money not yours so why would anyone care if I am wrong?"
It’s no wonder Afrasiabi just suddenly left last year with no mention. Also no wonder their games have been such a mess over lately. More than half the workforce play video games and get drunk all day while delegating work to the rest of the staff.
"Even if you were to completely ignore the lawsuit, the quality of Blizzard products has degraded drastically over the last few years. Also, increased competition and a mass exodus of hardcore loyalists for greener pastures dsnt help. They USED* to make the best games.I dont see any future for this company unless they make some drastic changes. People really shldnt trade based on sentiments but even without the lawsuit, its still pretty bad. They have ruined their long term interests in favor of milking the loyal fans for short term gains through increased micro-transactions. And now that the loyal fans are leaving in droves, Blizzard is done for - unless they actually use their resources to make a drastic - and i mean VERY drastic changes."
my eyed teared up when i saw green
"Regardless of the controversies, This is an ON SALE buy. Warcraft? Not going anywhere. CoD? Not going anywhere. Overwatch? Not going anywhere. This company has a solid footing in the gaming industry. They will restructure and be better. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BOOMER INVESTORS WHO SAY IT’S TRASH."
"10,000 calls have been bought today for ATVI to 87 by next Friday. We're down 21% from the 52 week high. Low PE multiple. Strong beat/raise quarter. Powerful fundamentals, big cash position, low margin. 83~ has to be the bottom. This is where you want to initiate a long position in the stock."
California expands lawsuit against Activision Blizzard
"Is not like i am not telling you fornlast 2 weeks that numbers are realy bad and that next x2 Q gona show the truth. I am sorry but you cant have 26MPSU same like 2016 with more games, and think everything is fine, and that number is gona be much much less in next few months. Delays are coming, for sure. They wanna change, it will cost them ignoring there player base for years, and is not like they were not telling them."
"Statement from Activision in response to today: “We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.”Responding to systemic harassment allegations filed by a Fair Employment Department with a threat to leave the state. This just shows more of the problem that goes up and down this company."
"Round trip here I come. Not worried at all though. Buying opportunity below 80. Gamers do not care about news. They don't watch the news. They play video games. Honestly I hope we go into the 60's so I can add even more. Fair value is 100 in my opinion, and fair value at 120 next year. So if they get this into the 60's you can essentially double your money in a year. That is how the market works. Just make sure to stick to the plan of buying more if it does down."

I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Will this rock tomorrow?
So many fell for this head fake by the big guys. Look at the fundamentals and ignore the drama of the day. This company has over 9 Billion in cash as much as the others combined. If you play the games then you know that the ones ATVI owns are the BEST in the business. WoW STILL is #1 despite all the people leaving/joining. The vision of the future of gaming is being written by ATVI. They will CRUSH earnings again on Tuesday. Long ATVI!!
"Thank you, Blizzard socialist justice warriors. I love buying stocks on sale. I couldn't do it without all your whinging about employee rights and whatever else you boring people complain about. Keep complaining! And I'll see you on the picket line.I'll be the one laughing all the way to the bank."
Buying the dip here
it'd ready to hit 100$ very soon.these are key-levels92$96$98$
"I buying my first gaming shares with ATVI on Monday. If the current political trend continues toward leftist idiocracy (great movie, BTW), gaming will be added to the list of government ""freebies"" and possibly amended to the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights."
How long before upgraded price targets get announced?
"If you sell, sell so I can buy more, this baby is a gem. Financials are bliss and you all worry about a lawsuit from FEHA, no shot anyone actually invests in this company easily switching their strategy up like the comment section. See you at $110"
I get the feeling a big player is pushing a short position.
"bought some more earlier today, already in the money."
"Technically, Best time to get in is now."
btw this is not down because CEO step down. It's actually bullish that they get new leaders with fresh ideas. It's down because Take-Two reported absolutely horrible numbers. They are dragging the entire gaming industry down. After the Q2 report it should go back up
"Activision Blizzard's HR Department may have been caught shredding documents that were requested by DFEH. If this is true, this means that ATVI is assuming guilt. Also, employees at the company have been posting documents on social media of the HR department trying to stop these same reports from getting out into the public. This is just getting worse. I am a bullish investor, but don't see any future growth for this company within the near future. Unless we get new information regarding the investigation, or the board gets completely replaced, I'm going to short Activision Blizzard until further notice. I've included an article link regarding the HR Document Shredding. Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/08/25/california-alleges-activision-blizzard-improperly-shredded-investigation-documents/"
"Man regardless of financials and performance outlook, the ethics and morality of a company should be considered and held to standard by all investors."
"$ATVI is now a buy, with upside of ~23%. Citi upgraded the stock late this afternoon"
Many hardcore blizzard customers are leaving and taking their followers with them. I’m talking about players with thousands of followers look it up on YouTube
"Diablo ii resurreceted and Diablo 4 , money printing soon"
"I could really care less about the news and will continue playing world of warcraft. For example : If something happens at Yamaha, I'm not going to sell my piano out of protest."
I have nevet followed this one but my gamer son asked my opinion. I told him to check out the CEOs software and gaming credentials and ignore the social issues stuf. I didnt knoe gaming CEOs wore full business suits. Let's get him a Hawaiian shirt and an appointment to smoke some quality stuff with Elon Musk... maybe that can help.
wow still at 82
Did Activision post a dividend this year? I don't recall getting one.
Does anyone know if ATVI rates well for ESG strategies? Even a whiff of social or governance issues will promote selling from ESG funds. Just a thought.
"ATVI is the worst gaming company on the planet! I'll never own their stock again. Not only do they allow cheaters to continue breaking their code, many believe they are profiting from it. It's ruining battle royale gaming as we know it. The first company that comes out against cheating and actively works to find cheaters will get my investment. ATVI karma is headed your way get you some good divorce attorneys your about to give a little more than half your money away. after that FIX your game."
"I like the bears BS, you can S my D, it’s going to 96-98 in next two weeks, lol. Play with each other until my next post."
kavanaugh hearing part 2.
after reading the lawsuit it makes sense why the stock has stalled.
The stock looks poised for a breakdown tomorrow. Buying opportunity in the $80's coming right up.
"At some point I'll invest in this company again. I believe they will get stuff cleaned up. However, I'm not investing a dime until I see the recurring subscription numbers.... this is not the bottom."
"Leadership at ATVI is disconnected from their customer base and their team.The company needs to promote a new team of leadership from the development trenches, who understands the internal team, and has a true love for video games.ATVI has lost it's heart."
How many times does ATVI have to CRUSH earnings before people believe that this company is making great products? Crying about people leaving WoW but failing to mention people are joining too and it is STILL the most played game. This company makes money! And a lot of it!! Ignore the distractions and look at the bottome line. Just a matter of time before this goes over $100 based on the fundamentals from analyst reports. So don't take my word for it.
"I am telling you, this doesnt look good. It will fall, if this new numbers are true. Then stock will plummet"
ITS RED EVERY DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of Duty Vanguard reveal event on Twitch gathered 800k live viewers. Seems to be really good and about to become the best selling game of the year again. RIP Battlefield & Halo
"Activision has nothing to worry about except catering to their core customer base. The Execs will just spew some lip service appropriate for the optics, and straight back to work. Let those who walk out do so, just hire replacements. Tons of applicants want to work in the game industry. Things will blow over this hiccup, and the purge of the rabbel rousers will be healthy for the long run."
