ATVI back in the 80s. Where are the shills claiming this was going to drop to 70?????????
"As an avid gamer, this company has no future. They have come to the end of their only IP worth anything. There is nothing to replace it! Its profits have come to an end."
"80s... 80s... 80s... Hey Shills were in the 80s. You said it couldn't happen, did you lie? Yaaa! 80s... 80s... 80s.... Rollin up into the 80s.... We are climbing up really really high! Yaaa!"
I heard about ATVI the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"this is my long term investment, adding more here"
"This stock have great balance sheet. Huge revenue, popular products, good management team. Profit margin is great number . Why can’t move up?"
"Come on, the nasdaq being up triple digits again today and seeing this bleed out makes the pain much worse."
Must be time to load up since Kotick is taking a pay cut and vowing to change the culture!!! TIME TO BUY!
Day traders will cream the next 2 days and on Monday it will go 85-95 range
https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/atvi/forecast This is current estimate so ignore the hype. ATVI has maintained guidence and have beat expectations regularly. They have said they have a number of big releases coming out in the next 12 months too that I do not believe are correctly factored into these estimates. low estimate is $100 Go ATVI
"Well, this is pretty much it. October is over. One trading day in November before earnings. If shorts feel lucky, they should go all-in at this juncture. I wish them nothing but the best (i.e. total obliteration)."
