"Regal Investment Advisors LLC Invests $286,000 in Activision Blizzard, Inc.Not that much but good sign anyway"
Christmas time may be decisive. We need an other project like candy Crush or COD. Cyclical
"They have 9 billion in cash. That alone is $12,25 per share. Then add in all the IPs, patents & assets they have + stable cash flow from the current and upcoming games. Extrenely undervalued. Also if you look at the twitch viewer numbers this drama has not affected to any ATVI games. Still same amount of streamers and viewers as before."
"Another law suit... stripping adult content from games... LOL Throw all the numbers you guys want at it, they have not revealed the true hit from recurring revenue. ATVI only has pain in the near future."
Feel bad for all the Oct 15 call options #BigLosses
"Activision CoD is doing amazing but all there other games are dying fast. WoW is almost nonexistent, lost respect with almost all there loyal player base, I see bad earnings ahead when CoD hype dies down and when WoW is fully dead."

Easiest money in the market so i took the risk and buy 500shares at 73$ :)
Waiting for higher gap tommorrow when market open.
"Citi upgrades Activision-Blizzard, says it’s time to buy the dip in the video game stockPublished Fri, Aug 13 20215:58 AM EDTUpdated 2 Hours Ago"
What is holding this great stock from moving upwards? Thoughts?
ATVI history shows major earnings beats for over a year and that is not going to let up imo. This stock is now selling as if it had never released CoD and THAT is crazy. I dumped half my position because this is #$%$ C e D up! Major manipulation going on and just no idea what to do but ride it out. This stock should be $100+ and Diablo is coming next year?
$18m to settle the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit. Moving on.
"Hey, Otter, I'm getting back in. I think there's a trade to be had here for a bounce. It's way oversold."
$120 stock. Long ATVI
What's going on? WHy up like this?
"This won't be over until they jettison CEO Bobby Kotick, but he's making so much money he won't want to leave."

"We’re heading to 75, watch and see."
"What a croc!!! I don’t know if ATVI will miss the next quarter guidance, but I do know they have some of the best games and MANAGEMENT. ATVI is great in free to play and ESPORTS. I’m looking forward to a solid last quarter. Third quarter is always the slowest before they release the new COD. Lawsuits like these happen all the time and in most big companies. Time will tell. LONG ATVI since 2006"
To have the safest margin for Blizzard is at 68- 70. Anymore than that you wont be a good long term returns. Just an advise :)
A pretty tepid rally considering the stock dropped $8 in three days. But I'll take it.
You know it's over when: World of Warcraft changes the name of the Big Love Rocket mount to the X-45 Heartbreaker in an effort to desexualize the game. Some players spent years trying to get that mount. The game will be unrecognizable a year from now.
$70 shall we !
I probably missed the Vanguard event but as of right now 749k viewers of Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch.Top streamer pro Tim the Tatman had 121k viewers.
My gamertag is YeahPete for those who want to play.
"Press Release:Activisionless Buzzard announces November 2021 release for its’ latest edition of COD, Call Of Duh, Bankrupted.

"If $73.03 support holds over the next few trading days the bottom is likely in. However, if support doesn't hold expect an additional leg down to between $67 - $68.90. Full disclosure, I currently hold no positions in ATVI, just an investor that'll load the wagon should an additional leg down to below $70 occur... GL & Trade Safe!!"
I would encourage everyone to short this stock because earnings is coming up and this company never beats earnings expectations.
Going back toLow 50s
"They have this stock locked at $82.50. I keep thinking it's going to break out, but it's being tightly controlled."
100$ soon!
"The main point about ATVI is the business core itself floats forever at 60-80 dollars on average, with some #$%$ dividends. 0 shareholders reward, a ridiculous investment to be in. Rather buy some HomeDepot shares. lol.Doesn't matter if a new games come out, the share prices dies down eventually and back to 75 average AGAIN. It's just acting like an AMC stock overall."
This is going back to low 50s
Diablo2 resurrection!
If it drops to $70 I'm buying
Second buy today for me @74.50
Diablo 2 Ressurrected beta test 200k live viewers on Twitch. It will be even higher when the game is actually released. The hype is real
Wish big corporations can file countersuits and defamation suits against hedge funds with deep pockets paying media companies to hype up bearish and wokester propaganda … fundamentals don’t lie…….
Any known catalyst for the BoD buying?

No more days of Apex having lots more viewers as the uptick from its new season has passed.Meanwhile it may be that either Esports tournaments like the recent Firedog Whiskey event or Call of Duty Vanguard reveal has increased interest in Warzone.
LOL.. NO NEWS... dropping like a rock.
it looks like we will see a 52 week low today.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
I heard about ATVI the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Back on track be patient
"Next oneDuality Advisers LP acquired a new position in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in the 2nd quarter, according to the company in its most recent Form 13F filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission. The firm acquired 21,968 shares of the companys stock, valued at approximately $2,097,000..."
"Dead stock. Lower and lower it goes. Blizzard is a failure and bleeding subscription numbers, Call of Duty Warzone is a fad and Vanguard will be the worst selling COD since Infinite Warfare. This is a complete dud! Sel sell sel!"
"Lets break out:ATVI as a group consists of three divisions. 1. Activision is the main sales driver: Q2, $ 789 million. 2.King Digital, the mobile gaming division, is a profitable, future-oriented cash cow with Q2 sales of USD 635 million. And the scandalous 3 Blizzard division, a strange, ineffective organization / gathering around World of Warcraft, which has already been fundamentally in crisis for several years in a row, is dying. Q2 sales: $ 433 million.Blizzard had almost complete autonomy within the group as a whole. And so Bobby Kotick could not interfere in their politics to reorganize the division to make more profitably according to his plan. The ongoing scandal is now the chance for Bobby Kotick to given control of the Blizzard division and will (the chance) to turn them into a highly efficient division and be able to restructure a significantly more profitable unit. The chances are good. It's just the temporary loss of reputation. And this can be remedied with good corporate results and a gender-friendly corporate restructuring. Especially since the current game pipeline looks very robust."
How many times does ATVI have to CRUSH earnings before people believe that this company is making great products? Crying about people leaving WoW but failing to mention people are joining too and it is STILL the most played game. This company makes money! And a lot of it!! Ignore the distractions and look at the bottome line. Just a matter of time before this goes over $100 based on the fundamentals from analyst reports. So don't take my word for it.
$80 close should be max pain for tomorrow.
"You think the numbers are bad from the lawsuits?? Wait until you see the disappearing recurring revenue reports. Lot of people blowing hot air, when they know the worst has yet to begin."
This stock isn't ownable at this juncture. It looks like it wants to test $69 by 11/1.
Atvi in future :
A weekly reversal could be in play if we close over $84 on friday
"The sheer amount of law firms infesting this situation is unbelievable. I am not trying to diminish or take anything away from the justice that the leaders have to pay for, but this is absurd. What a bunch of mosquitoes..."
"Activision Blizzard's HR Department may have been caught shredding documents that were requested by DFEH. If this is true, this means that ATVI is assuming guilt. Also, employees at the company have been posting documents on social media of the HR department trying to stop these same reports from getting out into the public. This is just getting worse. I am a bullish investor, but don't see any future growth for this company within the near future. Unless we get new information regarding the investigation, or the board gets completely replaced, I'm going to short Activision Blizzard until further notice. I've included an article link regarding the HR Document Shredding. Link: https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/08/25/california-alleges-activision-blizzard-improperly-shredded-investigation-documents/"
"As a former Warcraft player, CEO Bobby Kotick is the guy I'd like see being shown the door. He did a great job ruining everything fun and enjoyable about the game through the business strategy of greed and the people he appointed to shift game development in that direction. Sure, they made a fortune doing it but at what long-term price? I stopped playing and sending them my money several years ago due to the shift in game philosophy and content. I'd go back in a heartbeat if Kotick and his developer team of raid centrics were removed."
I don't buy the idea that gamers will leave because of that harrassment news. FUD

Earnings reports are in from the video gaming companies and i believe ATVI is the CLEAR winner. As many of us have been saying.. ATVI makes the absolute best games in the business because they have the best programmers. That is just the bottom line. Focus on this and make money as this stock has NO business selling at this price.
"Buy the dip, just short term noise!! Just do it!! In a couple months you'll be glad you did and you can thank me then!!"
I bet CareFree and Woei Cherng are the same person xD
I heard about ATVI the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Wow.. and on NO news.
the gaming sector is down on no information!?
Management is a joke
"Just how many last chances can you have to enter this ""lawsuit""?"
$115 or $120 would be pretty noissss to see by the end of this month. So glad I am not a short on this moonshot stock. GLTA.
Conflict of interest with SEC getting involved I wonder who is short and who is protecting who…. Filing a complaint right now with my senator and DOJ
Love the price action in here !
"Yesterday while playing world of warcraft classic tbc, I asked my guild if they heard that the blizzard president stepped down and an actual mythic wow player was going to become president. Most of the 30 ppl o line didn't even know of any of the news. The gamers are all still playing as if nothing changed. Most people playing the game itself don't care about what happened at the blizzard hq behind closed doors. I play the game because it's fun and I will continue playing it for another 15 years."
"Round trip here I come. Not worried at all though. Buying opportunity below 80. Gamers do not care about news. They don't watch the news. They play video games. Honestly I hope we go into the 60's so I can add even more. Fair value is 100 in my opinion, and fair value at 120 next year. So if they get this into the 60's you can essentially double your money in a year. That is how the market works. Just make sure to stick to the plan of buying more if it does down."
RUMOR: Battlefield 2042 delayed. Guess who benefits if this rumor circulating around the Internet is true?
Roblox misses revenues leaving ATVI as the only worthwhile inveatment for video game publishing.Diablo 2 Beta was a great success. Mostly saw positive feedback from Twitch watchers and streamers. That releases in about a month and will jump start Blizzard as they release more Diablo games in the coming months (Diablo Immortal for example).
My god... is the paint dry yet?

"NewsflashActivisionless Buzzard announces release of new game “Treading Water”. The interactive puzzle allows investors/players to utilize the stock’s prior 6 month performance as a guide to other time wasting experiences such as sitting in a running parked car, standing in place on 1 leg, waiting for a pot of water to boil, studying a stopped clock, expecting your local postal carrier on time , drawing to an inside straight, and lastly a run up in ATVI stock."
The road to $100 !
"I'd really like to know who bought those 10k options at 87 strike price expiring today. They paid $.55 - $.75 so the total cost of that trade was over $550k. The stock was $83 at the time. Or was this a hedge against a short position? If so, it's a pretty big short position. 10k options control a million shares. If that's the trade, they got $2 on the short shares (at least) or $2m and lost $550k on the hedge. $83m to short the shares. You need 25% of that in your account plus the cost of the options so call it an outlay of $21m. Profit of $1.5m. That's a 7% return in two weeks. Not too shabby if that was the trade. There's over 10k open interest on the Sept 17 85s. I think there's a good chance the stock will move higher over the next two weeks."
282k viewers on COD WARZONE. Multippe Major Tournaments going on including Twitch Rivals and Worlds This is without Symfuhny streaming today who draws 10K+ viewers himself consistently.COD Warzone is always where the action and excotement is.Games like DOTA are dying off. They peaked years ago. COD Warzone continues to grow and a new Pacific Map and Anti-cheat system is coming November or December.ATVI may have its issues but those are being delt with. Investing is about growth and all the growth is with ATVI. All the Esports growth. All the best game developers. All the Mobile Growth. You name it. Nothing has changed. ATVI is still ATVI.

"Pre-Orders of Activision's Next Call of Duty Tracking Well -- Market TalkBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 9:58 AM ET 10/04/20210958 ET - Activision Blizzard's ( ATVI ) next Call of Duty game, due out Nov. 5 with a retail price of $59.99, is on track to be another hit for the shooter series, according to an analysis of weekly GameStop best-seller data by Cowen. With six weeks of preorder data for ""Call of Duty: Vanguard,"" the investment firm projects console sales to reach a healthy 23.8M units by the end of 1Q 2022. The annual release is typically Activision Blizzard's biggest revenue driver, making Cowen's projection noteworthy"
"Of course I am biased as an ATVI investor but I have to say Amazon's New World looks really boring.In 1 scene was a cave where it litterally was just a bunch of people attacking 1 enemy at a time. Cave didn't look interesting to me either.No fist weapons like claws or brass knuckles. It appears to just be sword, axe, staff, bow. Some morning stars / daggers as well... Nothing creative or inventive.The crafting and gathering of ingrediants to make stuff seems incredibly dominating in what you are supposed to do. Most MMOs leave this as an additional thing to do and not so dominating.1 streamer walked his character into a large BAR. Inside were empty tables.... Zero Patrons in the bar to talk to. Just a bartender. ????A boss fight from.another streamer with what I noticed was ZERO music. A silent boss fight??? what??? Maybe the streamer turned off the music before hand??? maybe??? The boss fight dungeon was really boring. No decorations of any kind adorning the walls. No blood splatter or dead bodies leading to the boss fight. Just walls and flames from ensconced torches. The flames were same dang greyish blue color of the walls and floor.I noticed as 1 streamer was travelingnthrough town how few buildings there were that allowed you to walk inside.The quests you get seemed almost exclusively fetch quests.This game just was awful. I didn't see any mounts to ride and I gather from reading up on it.... The game litterally doesn't have any mounts."

But, someone getting paid to talk down a stock on Yahoo Finance is going to only say bad things on RED days to create what is known as FUD.FUD is a technique by paid shills to try and make longs scared and nervous and eventually sell their shares so Short Sellers earn more profits."

"Not yet an upward trend until closing orice of $85+ in my opinion, but loving the action here nonetheless.Why the move up? Simple. Call of Duty Vanguard reveal."
This company has ZERO future. It has lost any confidence it had in the gaming world. They are a joke now.

Any normal shareholder knows that the lawsuit accusations were a poor excuse to send this great company stock down $11. Long ATVI since 2006.
Short squeeze today.$88+ incoming.Thanks Bobby.
So this company is going out of business because some drunk guys were crawling under the desk?
"Viewership on Twitch for Diablo 2: Resurrected has been massive. At one point reaching over 410,000 yesterday. That was numbers much greater than Warzone on a major tournament day.Earlier this morning 153,000."
"One thought, will GME buy ATVI? GME now has no debt and piles of money, and recently just claimed they were no longer the game retailer any more."
Look back at Blizzards stock about a year before they unveiled Overwatch. Overwatch 2 and all the other games they have rolling out in 2022 is going to ramp things up in massive ways.
"Sorry bears, 6billion lost in market cap over a lawsuit isn't going to last."
Nice reaction to the AAPL news.
Everything happening right now is just irrelevant noise. Wait until they unleash their massive lineup of game in 2022 before you judge Activision’s future.
Institutional investors dumping the stock right before close.
So glad I bailed at 92.
Selling is overdone. Loaded up at $73. Thank you sellers.
Has anybody realized that the entire Asia zone inly representes 12% of ATVI revenues??And people are still concerned about China..
"per usual, Media hyping this discrimination lawsuit. It doesn't change the facts that ATVI has 9 Billion in cash, awesome games, great Esports & Mobile, and their results won't be hindered by this. Atvi will go on producing great games and make extraordinary income from them in the next 12-18 months. Say what you will about the lawsuit, but the juggernaut continues on. LONG ATVI."

Activision Blizzard deserves to crash and burn. Fully unethical and greedy company. With their zero appetite for any change they are guaranteed to have a new lawsuit to deal with every quarter while more employees and customers are walking out.
give me 80$ and i will go all in ^^ - tbh great stock for long term!
I keep buying …
"Dota2 > any of this company's games.Compare the stream numbers, prize pool, events counts and sponsorships. This stock is just bagging your money, giving back you pennies while their management are earning interest on your present investment. I say its no brainer to sell out and put the amount on other places."
When this stock gets above $83 it's going to explode to $88.
"Time to bet against the market today, this harassment case doesn't impact the fundamentals of the company imho.With Diablo 2 Ressurected out in september, a lot of 40-50 year-olds will spend some cash to play this game again, even a so-so earnings call today wouldn't be much of a problem.Taking the risk to add some shares."
"Now the Tencent news piled on top of the lawsuit, Overwatch 2 delays, and no new big IP is gonna keep dragging this down. Wouldn't be shocked if this is back in the 60's soon. I'm waiting to get back into this but I'd like to see all the dust to settle. It's a great company. They need a new franchise badly."
ATVI earnings reports are gonna CRUSH the short sellers and paid shills:
how big is the scandal?
"Buy around Activision releases or announcements. Nothing coming out of blizzard unless it's outsourced or half-baked. And if PR can't do a better job it will fall til something positive comes out note worthy. Overwatch is a mess, expecting a reforged like launch from Diablo 2.If they rush Diablo 4 along with CoD stuff that would be my time to jump in. otherwise I'm sitting back watching the dip and waiting."
Shorted at $82.
I heard about ATVI the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"D2 not on Mac, short now"
Undervalued pain
I'm not even gonna say it. But this is why you don't automatically ignore an opposing perspective and get emotional when trading.
September is over. Let’s get things going !
RSi 27....The bottom is in......
"At some point I'll invest in this company again. I believe they will get stuff cleaned up. However, I'm not investing a dime until I see the recurring subscription numbers.... this is not the bottom."

"In a final attempt to get around the Yahoo Auto-ocker.A games website popular has an article.New game from other company possibly has same issue as COD Warzone has had. A company that makes hacks is claiming they can Hack this new game from this other company.If true then I guess this certaintly is an issue that will.impact everyone and not just ATVI. Hopefully, Publishers can defeat these things to make their games fair.Sorry to be vague but only method to try to get the info..out. Really good article to read though."
"With deadline passed, Happy no more law firm clutter posts."
"I am telling you, this doesnt look good. It will fall, if this new numbers are true. Then stock will plummet"
"I love it when bad press hits a company, and the bad news has nothing to do with the current or future financial outlook of the company involved. Let this serve as a lesson... Bad news surrounding any ""financially sound"" company will result in a ""temporary"" negative impact on SP; however, almost 100% of the time the SP recovers to pre-news levels within 2-3 months. A lot of $ has and will continue to be made anytime situations similar to ATVI's occur. So while the scared sell just wait, watch and buy after the initial bounce on above average volume. You'll be glad you did... Easy..."
Thx bears and shorts and wokesters for cheap shares ….
"Lawyers are so greedy. Sure, I've lost money on my investments but I'm not going to take anyone to court over it. What a ridiculous case. Furthermore, the legal challenge relates to a certain division of the business and their practices do not reflect the over all culture of the company. For example, you can find a recent article from the developers of Diablo II resurrected who are a separate division of Activision Blizzard stating that they were not implicated in any of the charges but they still implore you to do what you think is right in terms of your consumer decisions. So don't be a sap and jump on the media band wagon there is always two sides to every story, think critically and stick with the facts. Just have a look at the companies market cap, it's insane! Putting all the noise aside, this stock is a total bargain atm."
"I can't believe that with people leaving World of Warcraft in large numbers and the class action lawsuits, that this stock is not taking a nose dive.."
"If the NAZ doesn't rally off today's lows, then look out below. It could and probably will drop another 700 points in a matter of days. $69-$71 is entirely possible in the short term in this scenario."
"Get puts I've been locked out of Diablo 2 all morning, they keep having issues with connecting!!!!! Puts until this is fixed!!!"
$ATVI $CLX $FDX im glad i dodged these when i sold it last year..
"A tech company with dividend,profit,a customer base and a reasonable P/EYes,yes,yes."
Call of Duty Vanguard reveal event on Twitch gathered 800k live viewers. Seems to be really good and about to become the best selling game of the year again. RIP Battlefield & Halo
"Let's see what the next releases like Call of Duty will bring. The HR and management approach will probably have to change, if needed (the reality). The investigations are ok, that's what the regulators are about)))"
Whoever is driving this rocket ship.. easy.. we are fine with going up $5 a week.
"I buying my first gaming shares with ATVI on Monday. If the current political trend continues toward leftist idiocracy (great movie, BTW), gaming will be added to the list of government ""freebies"" and possibly amended to the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights."
people are giving away free money. way oversold
"60's inc .. used to be a good company , now its just a micro transaction circus. no innovation no devs , copy pasta year after year."
Buy buy buy
"It had beaten analysts' expectations for its fiscal second quarter earnings results, option traders are taking actions suggesting that they think the share price will move higher in the future. This may come as a mild surprise considering the recent controversy around the company, but the share price did rise 2.12% the day after the earnings announcement."
ATVI chief legal officer Hart to leave the company. This is not the bottom.
100% catastrophic…
"Citic Securities Co., Ltd initiated coverage with a recommendation of buy. PT up 34% to $105"
"The company is stable, profitable and growing....why the dithering on the stock?"
Go go go!!!!!
18 million doesn't sound like a lot. (with 9bil cash).....lets hit 80$ today ^^
Expect $60 !
"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/morgan-stanley-names-activision-blizzard-a-top-pick-outside-of-faang-names.htmlMorgan Stanley names Activision a top tech pick outside of FANG names, predicts a nearly 50% rally. Maybe this will goose it higher."
Can someone explain that is SEC investigation over or not?It seems EEOC and SEC are different organisations
Grateful for the money I made on puts on this company. Despite the incel who harassed me on this board over it.Market really didn’t care about lawsuits in the end. Workers protesting and walking out? That did the trickSwitched to calls yesterday. It’s all up here from here.
I think the Pope wants to open an investigation. And I heard that Kim Jong-un is investigating. He thinks maybe he can learn something from Bobby's tactics. Anyone else?
"China bans all new video games indefinitely. But nothing to see here, move along."
"Technically, Best time to get in is now."
And now they are being investigated by the SEC
Next good NewsMorgan Stanley on Thursday named Activision Blizzard a top pick for 2022 among non-FAANG stocks.
"This stock will be hitting close to the $90.00 by the Release of ""Diablo 2 Resurrected"" Sept. 24.The negative feedback will soon pass away like it does all companies. ATVI has great financials and cash flow until they release other games. Diablo 4 is going to be one of these game to keep your eyes on."
"$ATVI is now a buy, with upside of ~23%. Citi upgraded the stock late this afternoon"
"10,000 calls have been bought today for ATVI to 87 by next Friday. We're down 21% from the 52 week high. Low PE multiple. Strong beat/raise quarter. Powerful fundamentals, big cash position, low margin. 83~ has to be the bottom. This is where you want to initiate a long position in the stock."
"Does ATVI have a share buyback program? If not, seems like an excellent time.to start one. These programs are set up to simply allow ATVI to buyback shares not obligate/force them to buy X shares at X time, rather they can buyback at their own leisure/discretion within the set time period for the program.Can't wait for Diablo Immortal."
"As a female game developer with more than 15 years of experience I can tell you, fundamentals are no garbage. I worked for Ubisoft, EA, King(Activision). I got out last year from the gaming industry because I wanted to do more than entertainment. Although all are the same I would say that at King I had the time of my life. All IT companies are the same so keep the eye on fundamentals. Someone just smelled the pile of cash."
wow still at 82
And then it got quiet.
ATVI News reported yesterday:Diablo 2: Resurrected pre-orders for Nintendo Switch coming soon.Previously it wasn't confirmed the game would release for the Switch
u guys in dilutional mode !
All the ESG funds are going to have to sell since they can no longer hold this stock
Great close
Most short-able stock there is. Joke of a company
Too many people are focused on the short term. Big investors aren’t going to care about the lawsuits and noise. Fundamentals will drive this company in the long run.
I get the feeling a big player is pushing a short position.
"Call of Duty Warzone Twitch Viewers: 104,000Apex Legends: 75.9kBack to normal. Back to Warzone as king. Only reason Apex was ahead for a week (if even that much) was due to their new season that introduced a new character (Seer) that had to be nerfed because it was overpowered / out of balance with the other character choices."
haha $70 this week$60 by end of month!
VANGAURD is going to bring so much money to this company it’s insane. First COD people are excited for in a while.
"Someone bought 500 puts at 86$ strike for 10/09/2021, he's hedging a long position."
I am very happy that i sold when I did. I am keeping an eye on it for a re entry point
"Idk why everyone in the comment section is bashing this company. I ve been gaming my whole life and WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch and all the CoD games after the purchase of activision are probably the best games ever. I don t see how this conpany doesn t thrive in the future. Financials are solid in my opinion and everything looks good. Do i care about all the law suits? No sir."
I am shocked to see this down and the others up. Left half my position here and may have to pull it all. This is so hard to make sense of. Great company making the best games bar none. Beats earning EVERY quarter. Tons of cash on hand. Endless positives. So why the beat down...

ATVI up while EA down big today as rumors of Battlefield 2042 delay have been confirmed late last night.
bankruptcy next
Surprised at the 1.5 million shares volume at the bell! What is going on?
Sad that there is no news about this company. Only law firm advertising.
Added to my position today. will be adding again if she goes lower. I am expecting a bounce here. Way too many people are bearish which means it's gonna go up. still have lots of dry powder. Sold a bunch of stocks 2 weeks ago in anticipation of a pullback.
ATVI a 10 percent holder of MYPS. A great upstart !!!
"This stock is the best deal among large cap names, if one ignores the short-term noise..."
"I want back in but I won't touch this with your money till this lawsuit is behind them. It's rather buy later at a higher price than now with this cloud of them. Settlement could be a billion, people will be fired, etc...Then gaming in every aspect will become woke and ruined along with it. There's no in between for a company of this size."
War zone anti-cheat kernel leaked. Bad news in abundance. When it Rains it pours!

Buying the dip here
"Well, going below $73.03 support indicates a continued bearish trend to below $70.... ($67 - $68.90)..."
"Woof Woof, look at the dog stock and all its’ owners."
"Activision Blizzard is currently sitting on a war chest of $9 billion. With between $2 billion and $3 billion in cash flow coming this year and only $3.6 billion in debt, none of which is due until 2026, management can get really creative with how it is going to spend this huge cash pile. It is already choosing to reinvest in development, with plans to hire 2,000 developers over the next two years. It could buy another studio like Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA), which is the perfect size for Activision Blizzard with a market cap of $9 billion. However, the best move for the company is probably to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. It has a $4 billion authorization outstanding, and with a market cap of $60 billion, it could reduce its share count by over 5% while still leaving a strong cash cushion if management sees any new investment opportunities."
"Didn't see the lawsuit coming, but it's here. MANY OTHER TECH COMPANIES have been sued or are being sued(Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc.). ATVI will make it through this, and with an array of new titles, they will prevail. Owned this baby for 15 years. Saw the last drop from $80 to $39 back in Oct- Dec 2018. It came back. Saw it drop when they bought out Blizzard from Vivendi. Long and short, everyone has a long or short stake in the stock. I'M LONG TERM and believe management and their belief in ESPORTS, Frre to Play, and MOBILE will pay off. Will something new come along-- of course. I expect ATVI will be on the cutting edge. By the way, very little of their profits come from CHINA> LONG ATVI since 2006."
"Insider Trends: Insider Purchase Adds to Activision Blizzard Positive TrendBY MT Newswires— 7:05 PM ET 08/09/202107:05 PM EDT, 08/09/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Peter J Nolan, Director, purchased 20,765 shares in Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ) on Aug 05, 2021, for $1,677,320.

$79! Next stop $80!How are you all Short Sellers doing out there with your infinite losses? You get to pay for my dividend next year while Overwatch 2 or Diablo Immortal release after a spectacular Call.of Duty Vanguard Launch.I hope Shilling pays you well.
"Doesn't matter what the future of Gaming will be. Video Game Publishers are the content creators period. Metaverses or self-learning software or my personal concept which I won't get into because it is part of my fictional novel unfinished. Bottom line whenever technology appears to shape gaming, Activision Blizzard will adopt it or acquire whomever to adopt it."
