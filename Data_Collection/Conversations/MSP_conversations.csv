Datto is positioning itself to be in a great position. Compare Q3 19 vs Q3 20 and still expanding.
First!
Are there any similarities between this and TTD?
Buy this stock it is low float. In few month it will boom
"We hit $30! With no PR come on Datto, give us something."
"Bought 300 shares more. I hate the fact about the volume, but it's definitely a 35-40$ company, if it stays on the path they took!"
great ER proud of these guys. Journey has started. not sure why my ealier post not showing.
Madison Strategic Sector is up 5.59% to 26.83
"as always, start low, go up in the end of the day:)"
I bet Hunter Biden likes this stock
I feel a rally coming on!!!!
Buddy of mine told me to hurry and buy at $29 Plus before it went to $30 plus..... I have a feeling this was a mistake ? Any thoughts as why this should be acting stock ?
They had some interesting insights about MSP on (http://stocktip.xyz). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This will be big 
What’s going on ?? Looking bearish ?
this going up today!!!!!
Strong buy - growing big in the UK and buying integrating products which will drive revenue
Good day for the stock. Will see how reacts the market to the earnings report.
"Been watching stock, finally bought in today, may be a little early, but looks like bottom is in for now."
"this is so thinnly traded to start with you pretty much have to buy and wait for the slow, but hopefully sure, build up of volume and interest. What get price moving is ongoing steady results that can't be ignored. Volume is also a two edged sword- very littel required to move the stock price up or down in a fairly big way. ER monday so glta."
Volume is increasing day by day... full year report is coming next month.
"Tuff analyst action of late. they are taking a show me first attitude. volume/action here is anemic for sure like almost nil. that's concerning. will take some positives to get this on folks' radar, in the end must grow volume to get big participation."
Datto is a dying business. Many customers are cancelling their SIRIS contracts because they are moving physical servers to the cloud. Datto was built around backing up physical servers to on-prem hardware and their core business and revenue generator is collapsing daily.
"This is really exciting to know that IPO Proceeds will be used to pay down their outstanding debt. “Datto will use its IPO proceeds to pay down debts that it accrued during its takeover from Vista (private equity: a good deal for private equity). However, Datto’s CEO Tim Weller told TechCrunch in a call that the company will still be well-capitalized after the public offering, saying that it will have a very strong cash position.”"
Any idea when options start trading?
"10X potential in 6-12 months!What you read below is in regards to $MSP; is not meant to be financial advice or tell you to buy; its just some thoughts I'd like to share. Someone posted in the msp ceo channel today ""There is an alleged short and they have been shorting this play for a while. The house positions since January say Anon is net sell $1 million. “ That being some are making the conservative assumption $300k is short even tho there is speculation of it being more or less or nonexistent. If it's real This is massive relatively speaking for CSE TSX.V plays The average for this alleged short position according to the house positions on CEO since Jan 1st is approximately 20c; which means the short is likely underwater; there are 15 million shares free in the market that aren’t being held according to some. I don’t think the parent company shares are even registered. This is the evidence at hand to support the short squeeze hypothesis, now onto the company; $MSP has a parent company by initials S&P that is a multi-billion $ revenue-generating international conglomerate that relies on $MSP to land contracts under the Canadian Umbrella. This is why they took a stake in the first place imo. S&P provides funds and resources as required to $MSP which is why $MSP doesn’t look liquid on paper, but the reality is they have access to a ridiculous amount of funds needed to work towards the contracts. This eliminates risks related to going-concerns etc. due to the operational nature of the company $MSP has EOI’s for multiple government to government contracts; with a projected $2 billion in revenue in the pipeline best-case scenario. Now some are saying these are just typical EOI’s, but there is a bigger reality at play which is why some have generated such bullish sentiment. Someone described it as the following; “Think of it like an arranged marriage. The deal is done....the dowry terms are just getting hammered out” In other words; the EOI does not mean they are bidding amongst others, it means they have already been selected as the Sole Sourced government to government bidding party and are in the negotiation phases until the terms of the contract have been handed out…. But again what does this means for investors? Where is the meat???!!! The meat is from a deposit that could result during these negotiations… Lets say a contract is $100 million and conservatively $MSP takes 10% of the deposit in advance for fees pertaining to the planning process; this could mean $10 million could be sent to $MSP and related parties. S&P has no incentive taking this money in my opinion as they have a huge incentive to legitimize their Canadian company to land more deals. So lets assume most of this money goes to $MSP. Just a deposit; makes $MSP liquid for an amount of approximately $8-10 million conservatively. That is insane when they have 8+ contracts they are working on and 3 In their advanced stages where a deposit could land near term. This could have drastic effects for a company below $20 million market cap. Now for the longer term investors; Within 3-12 months $MSP may have a contract; This range is wide but it means a contract could land anytime mainly due to the government to government negotiation process. This is where speculation could kick in but when they finalize even 1; mark my words $MSP has established 10x potential. OK so lets summarize Parent Company Backing Massive short position Deposit near-term catalyst Contract medium long-term catalyst. This is the bullish case for $MSP. Do your own Due Diligence, Cheers!"
"Per the latest PR, as I understand it, DATTO released/sold 3,300,00M shares to the folks whom served as underwriters. Why couldn’t they just buy from the previous 23,300,00 shares, that would of bumped up the Price. I don’t agree, to whom can I complain?"
or maybe after market close?
"Good news, we are expending"
have customer users seen a lot of needed chkdsks to fix 'erorrs' that the backup process throws off requiring intervention? curious abt overall experieinces with the backup product liek siris.
Is DataDog and Crowdstrike the competition?
"Datto / Autotask are an MSP suite of tools for backups, cybersecurity and computer networking. They are growing rapidly. This will go up.."
"Datto is already in a high demand business DRET “disaster recovery. Not only that, but it is using a cloud base product. In the old days, businesses were using physical servers to backup data. I really hope people see the goodness that this company can deliver."
"i see like someone is playing here. High volume at buys at highs, low volume at sell, that is moving stock 1-2% down"
look at the financial statement. you will wanna add this more.
Here we go.
"Thanks for an opportunity to get back in:) I was monitoring the stock before and since ER report. Waiting to get back to 30 in 1-2 weeks, and test 35 before Q4 report"
beat and raise
Datto Holding is up 5.65% to 27.50
So is the only comparable competitor VEEAM and Dropbox? These seem like they are a partial competitor. Is their a competitor that offers their full solution suite?
