I'm looking forward to the interview with $IPG CEO Peter Cashin tomorrow. Already emailed in my questions. Should be very informative. This is certainly an exciting period for Imperial and all of its investors!

Our American friends finally appear close to passing their bipartisan infrastructure bill. Still full of drama over there but I say it will get done. This should be a big boost to Canadian miners like $IPG.
"I was on the webinar this morning. Great talk from the CEO Peter Casing and some good questions which got some extra info out in the open. Shame if anyone invested here missed this. Those are golden opportunities to get extra info and a general feel for the company and what's next. Anyhow ... here is what I took out of that webinar;1. Provincial Government is already onboard. Big news will be that the Federal Government is getting involved too. Expect an announcement sometime soon.2. PEA or Preliminary Economic Assessment report out by the end of 2021 or early 2022.3. The collaboration with Eck Industries has very good chances to becoming reality and if so $IPG would supply Eck with very significant 50-60 tons of #Scandium annually.4. #REE or #RareEarthElements would be contracted outside for processing. 5. Mining on the property would be done in the warm Spring - Fall season. This would cut costs by avoiding the extreme winter conditions in Northern Quebec and significantly cut costs. They can mine all the ore they need in the warm season to produce #Scandium all year round.6. Patent for extraction method is pending.7. New Chairman to the Board will be announced soon. It will be someone with significant financial expertise in the mining sector.8. $IPG continues to work on possible alloy development as is studying in detail the global #Scandium market as well as #Aluminum market in Quebec.9. $IPG has a Multi-Billion potential. If you build it, they will come!"
Indicated Resources of 7.3M tonnes grading 282 g/t Sc2O3 & Inferred Resources of 13.2M tonnes grading 262 g/t Sc2O3 for the Northern Lobe of the TG #Scandium Zone. Mineralization remains open laterally & at depth; potential to increase the resource with additional drilling. $IPG
"1. March 18, 2021 $IPG is awarded a $90,000 Federal Grant for Scandium Material Research with McMaster University. When the Federal Government gets involved you know that good things are coming. Cooperation with McMaster is a very welcome development.2. Then on May 18, 2021 it was announced that $IPG and Eck Industries Executed a Letter of Intent for Collaborative Scandium Material Research & Development.3. June 9, 2021 - Imperial Mining Develops High-Recovery Extraction Process for Scandium and Rare Earth Elements for Crater Lake Mineralization.4. Then June 23, 2021 Imperial Mining Receives Final Crater Lake Drill Results: Data Sent to Engineers for 43-101 Resource Estimation on TG Zone."
Let's go #IPG !! Is the kind seller at 16 cents done and are we going up???
The Interpublic Group of Companies is down 4.95% to 36.13
"That recent low at 13 cents was a perfect chance to buy into IPG at a discount. We are creeping back up the charts now. And without any surprises! Their Crater Lake Scandium & Rare Earth Elements property is a gem!! Just check the recent developments and what they already announced is coming in 2021. Easy to see that SP will only rise. Might explode - I think there is a very good change that this might be the case;1. March 18, 2021 $IPG is awarded a $90,000 Federal Grant for Scandium Material Research with McMaster University.

This alone could send SP soaring. It should be done by the end of July. With the resource estimation in hand, likely in July, and completion of the metallurgical flowsheet, $IPG will commence work on delivering a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the project some time this fall, as originally scheduled.When the PEA comes in $IPG should be anywhere between 50 cents to $1.00. This is a golden opportunity!! I've been increasing my position accordingly. I think there is time to do that until the 43-101 comes in and then we will see high SP. On the other hand this is a virtually zero risk bet. No way this will slide. Only upside here. Only question is how high will this go and within what period of time."
"""The transition to renewable energy, especially the electrification of transportation systems, will require a notable quantity of technology metals and materials"". Indeed, #Scandium is one of them!! $IPGhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-021-00211-6"
Interview with $IPG CEO Peter Cashin. Very much worth a listen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj6tKO24rt4
I heard about IPG the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). Itâ€™s looking like an interesting play.
"Yet another article on #IPG collaboration with Eck Industries on the battery box out of Scandium-Aluminum Alloy for a global auto manufacturer. This one from today, Oct 1st. https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2259648-eck-imperial-develop-scandiummodified-ev-alloy"

Imperial Mining Group is just about to release 43101 with significant volumes of Scandium and REE's. This will be just from a quarter of their property which is estimated to be the largest Scandium asset in the world. Located in Quebec where Rio Tinto is king. Rio already a global leader in aluminum and recently investing into Quebec Scandium. $IPG is a big moneymaker. Do not miss that one. Take a look - do your research!
