"If I see the way they have beaten their own guidance '16 and '17 and the fact that they mentioned they prefer to give a 'cautious first guidance', I trust much more solid the focus on actual results rather than on conservative guidance (normally beaten)"
Can someone explain to me why the stock is going down after the decent report?

"Got another example yesterday of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"
Quite a bit of profit taking late Friday. I switched three quarters to $TMV (rising 30 yr interest rates 3x leveraged) expecting 2.20% in a by Thanksgiving. Thoughts.
Could anyone explain why this stock is tanking this week? For I don't seem to find any negative news whatsoever regarding the company.
A is down -10.98% to 61.61
Have to admit to myself that I haven’t comprehended the business model as a whole early enough thus I might be late to start a position.Looking brilliant nevertheless.
Some profit taking in green tape. Adding on dips

"""The Dangers of Shorting Stock Should Not Be Underestimated""""When you short a stock, you are exposing yourself to a lot of potential financial pain. In some cases, when investors and traders see that a stock has a large short interest (a big percentage of its float has been shorted by speculators), they will attempt to drive up the price to force the shorts to ""cover"", or buy back the shares before it gets too out of hand.""""It is important to remember a few things if you are thinking about shorting stock. First, never assume you will be able to repurchase a stock you have shorted whenever you want at a price that resembles ordinary experience. The liquidity has to be there. If there are no sellers in the market, or there are so many buyers (including panic buying, which is caused by other short sellers attempting to close out their position as they lose more and more money), you have a serious problem. The most famous, and catastrophic, example of this is the Northern Pacific Corner of 1901. Shares of a particular railroad went from $170 to $1,000 in a single day, bankrupting some of the wealthiest men in the United States as they tried to get their hands on shares to buy them back and return them to the lenders from whom they had borrowed the stock."" ""Next, never assume that for a stock to go from price $A to price $C, it has to go through price $B. You may or may not have the opportunity to buy or sell on the way up or down, prices may instantaneously reset, the bid or ask jumping. It is something that is obvious to experience investors but new investors take for granted. Even in regular stock investments that do not involve shorting stock, there is this mistaken idea that a stop loss order can protect you under all circumstances, which simply isn't true. The major risk as it pertains to shorting stock is a corporate buyout or merger. It isn't unusual to wake up to an announcement that a company is going to be acquired for 40% higher than its stock price including a special $10 per share dividend or something, which means the short seller is instantly harmed in a major way.""""Finally, shorting stock is subject to its own set of rules. For example, you cannot short a penny stock, and before you can begin shorting a stock, the last trade must be an uptick or zero-plus tick."""

40X earnings for a 10% grower. Part of the general stock market bubble.
They had some interesting insights about A on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

Earnings beat but stocks are going down?
Never seen so many analyst upgrades in one day. Hopefully it translate to a huge gain today.
"What to look for in CCBig issue, of course, is Jakafi income--QoQ growth should be up a hair from last CC as PV charges on, GVHD does its bit and use in intermediate-1 MF expands. No surprise to anyone. The ultimate sales target might be raised officially, but that is mo surprise either. Iclusig also shouldn't generate surprises, making the Ariad deal look good for management.It's too dangerous to talk about bari at this stage, and epac announcements aren't Incyte's to make, so I don't expect anything there, even in response to questions.We ought to get a roadmap on GVHD plans. Maybe a time for go / no on a '465 (delta) push to approval. Probably announcement of a phase 2+ trial for an own / own drug combination. Probably at least that strong a commitment to a single-agent biologic.There are still a shitload of announced-possible but unpaid Novartis milestones, and with Jakavi being a bit of a highlight for them, $a few tens of MM more milestones would be no surprise.Another non-surprise that I'd seriously appreciate but don't expect would be naming of a non-oncology anti-JAK1 candidate. (Big targets would be psoriasis and Crohn's disease, which are expected to benefit from near-complete JAK1 shutdown along with less inhibition of other JAKs)I'll guess that some analysts will be frustrated that there are no new out-of-house epac results--everyone doing the work is still trying to deal with the need to stratify phase 2 results by PD L-1 status before planning phase 3s; there's a lot of flexibility available in scheduling announcement of phase 2 results and there's no benefit to announcing before you're ready either to drop or to schedule the next steps. This doesn't look like a stock-price-mover."
A $121.57 RSI 60 starting point a little high? Or is Agilent about to make a solid run for a week or more?

I thought the ER was good. Agilent is expending and has been pretty steady. Any fall in price should be temporary and it may attract investors that require safety.

Found some interesting information regarding shorts for A https://marketwirenews.com/short-information/NYSE/A
"We are all disappointed in the current state of affairs at this company, but I do believe in the management team. As I have described my take on WC in the past, he has geared up SG$A for the optimistic outlook he had foreseen. In all fairness to him, he thought the Italian deal was done. I do fault him for not moving more quickly to adjust for the current sales. People make mistakes, but you can't let your pride get in the way of doing the right thing for the shareholders. We need to do a better job at growing the business within cash flow. Increases in SG&A expenses always seem to be ahead of optimistic revenue projections. Again, I would like to thank the European Orbital division for their continued wins. And as always, the power distribution division for paying the bills. The sales cycle times are in their final stages for Orbital NA, we should see orders in the near future. Good News Coming Soon!!!!"
"Wanted to get in, but price was a bit high for me, however, I will soon get in as this is not the end of the world for A."

whole system is corrupt here. All this market manipulation by FED with rates. Every time markets go down they lower rates etc. Enough already I say crash and burn. So over priced period.
