EOLS is much better buy right now. Will fly on news of settlement with ABBV......
Finally seeing some volume and a bit of price movement. Not much to hang my hat on but looking like a little life is back.
JMP reached a 52 Week low at $3.90
ONLY 44 Million Market Cap. seems like it's a Tee Tiny company now-a-days.
"Have they Continued the Stock repurchase program, going forward.?? (Yes / No....and if so...How much can be spent, until when.??)"
"Well....with the Sale of ""JMP Credit Advisors"".... I wonder if they will 1. finish their stock buy-back program and 2. initiate a continuation of the buy back program to repurchase more shares this year & next...."
Is the merger good or bad for investors?
Decent earnings out today. CEO hinted of a strong 4th quarter... lots of potential deals nearly finalized. Sure seems like the reward-to-risk is intriguing with the stock at 2.55/share.
I tried to buy more this morning but TD Ameritrade never filled my order.
"I see that Webush Securites keeps nibbling on JMP shares. According to my math, they now own about 10% of the shares. Hoping JMP moves up big ahead of next earnings report... as we all remember the gigantic move up after the stellar earnings last quarter from JMP. If they deliver two straight blowout earnings reports, surely the market will start to notice."
I feel like we (long term shareholders) are about to be screwed. If they want to take JMP private there is nothing we can do. Jolson will name the price and we will take it because we have no options!https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/rejecttenderofferpublictoprivate.asp
Holy buckets!!!
Any concerns (or thoughts) about their Financial Ability to pay the Interest on these exchange traded notes.... like the 8% Notes due in 2023.?
The nice thing about $JMP is that they are already in a correction if one comes.
TO THE MOON!
looks like blowstocks is putting out buy signal
Any news on any upcoming dividend?!
JMP reached a 52 Week low at $4.59
"Some more buying by Wedbush Securities this week (small amounts... but still good to see). Looks like JMP is doing ""some work"" on the upcoming Coinbase IPO this week (if I am reading the S-1 correctly). That's gonna be a big one. Glad to see their name listed : ) Although they certainly are a small fish on that food chain... the usual big boy companies are listed in much larger font size ~"
makes no sense when the market is hot and investments continue to go down
"well....looks like the company is buying back from shareholders around 14% of the company's stock..... I guess THAT puts a ""ceiling"" on the price until the end of June."
JMP is down 5.49% to $4.82
"Isn't the stock repurchase plan, that IS being executed, really reducing the number of outstanding shares by quite a bit.? Does anyone Know the % of shares that has been actually reduced over the last 2 years.?? Is it like a 5% reduction in outstanding shares, or 10%, or more..."
"Ummm.... why hasn't the February 15th Interest on the 7.25% senior notes literally been posted yet.?? (per the issue's prospectus) DTCc says that they haven't gotten the money yet, from the paying agency (is that US BANK.?) ... hummm..."
"no interest in the stock , guess this would be great investment before market tanks"
Is the baby bond safe?
"WELL GUYS, 10$+ EASY TOMORROW"
"Yikes, latest press release says they are being delisted..."
Anyone have a theory on today's rise? It was nice to see. Could be people jumping in ahead of it going ex-dividend next week I suppose.
Buy!!! to the moon !!! Will skyrocket today
"They're calling away the 7 1/4 % issue again, and again, and again.... :/"
"Well, that didn't last long!"
2021 will be your year of manipulation will end as gold and silver will again be recognized as real money not federal reserve notes that are becoming worthless as the confidence of the people that use them and except them Will learn in 2021 silver and gold or money and everything else is credit this was shed by the person who your company is name for JP Morgan
Any guesses on what the divy will be?
"So JMPNL had a 20% Call.... BUT, who got exactly 20% Called away from them, and Who didn't.?? AND...even Better... did you get the ""plus accrued and unpaid Interest up to (but not including) the date of Redemption"" as written in the prospectus.??"
I'm Surprised another brokerage firm hasn't gobbled them up yet.
JMPNZ reached an all time high at 23.68
"Why hasn't the Interest that the company owes, been paid yet.?? Who's running the ship here.?? The 7.25% baby bonds are Missing the Feb. 15th Interest payment.!!! Hummm...."
What Is Going One.??? only 1 trade today for 272 shares.?? why is there no REAL trading going on.??
Always pumping in premarket and aftermarket. During the regular trading day hours it's not really desired.
4.80s to 4.90 WOW.... that's a big dividend yield now-a-days. *But is it safe (with financial health of the company)....Or what about those preferred shares.... (safe?)...
JMP reached a 52 Week high at 3.45
DO NOT BUY the US Stocks in this MEGA BUBBLE!The Valuations are ABSURD! A Heavy Correction is imminent!The US Market will COLLAPSE BIG TIME very soon!$AAPL $AMZN $JMP $TSLA
"GOOD RIDDANCE : the press release had the guts to say, ""Mack helped chart the strategic direction for a highly successful investment banking franchise, setting an example as an accomplished advisor to corporate clients."" BAHAHAHAHA He created NO shareholder long-term value.!!"
This should see a good run tomorrow
"Wow. no conversations here really.... even on earning release dates..... ""quiet little company"""
"If I am reading Air B#$%$ recently filed S-1, it looks like JMP is mentioned as one of the companies that assisted with them going public. Makes sense... given the CEO's remarks on the recent earnings call. Should bode for another strong quarter! Things are looking up for JMP. Finally!!"
"Can someone be kind enough on this board that knows about Bitcoin, tell me if Bitcoin is more valuable than Gold and Silver?"
"I'm sorry i dropped this to 5.27 today with my limit order, but I'll love it later "
maybe jmp group will be bought out by a more aggressive financial firm with targets that all fiduciaries have to meet or they get booted. .
"Earnings tank.... but ""Weâ€™re very proud of our first-quarter results, as they represent a continuation of the terrific momentum we built during such a successful 2020"""
Market Manipulation At-It's-Finest.... for the common shares today.
This gonna hit $15 end of today
i was lucky to get out at 3.30 a share..small loss but the nightmare is over
JMP reached a 52 Week low at $3.96
Any thoughts on the law firms trying to investigate the acquisition?
"Or just after the sell off, 1 min trade, just play with 1000 shares. Superb volatility for day trading"
"battered today, anyone thinks it will climb back? maybe a short squeeze eod?"
Heavy internal buying going on. It made vicks top buy this week. Sometime is brewing!
JMP reached a 52 Week high at 3.84
