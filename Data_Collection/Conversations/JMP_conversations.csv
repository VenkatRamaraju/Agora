"Some more buying by Wedbush Securities this week (small amounts... but still good to see). Looks like JMP is doing ""some work"" on the upcoming Coinbase IPO this week (if I am reading the S-1 correctly). That's gonna be a big one. Glad to see their name listed : ) Although they certainly are a small fish on that food chain... the usual big boy companies are listed in much larger font size ~"

"I see that Webush Securites keeps nibbling on JMP shares. According to my math, they now own about 10% of the shares. Hoping JMP moves up big ahead of next earnings report... as we all remember the gigantic move up after the stellar earnings last quarter from JMP. If they deliver two straight blowout earnings reports, surely the market will start to notice."
