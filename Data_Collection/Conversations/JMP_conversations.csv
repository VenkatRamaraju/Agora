Is the baby bond safe?
"Or just after the sell off, 1 min trade, just play with 1000 shares. Superb volatility for day trading"
Anyone have a theory on today's rise? It was nice to see. Could be people jumping in ahead of it going ex-dividend next week I suppose.
Is the merger good or bad for investors?
I feel like we (long term shareholders) are about to be screwed. If they want to take JMP private there is nothing we can do. Jolson will name the price and we will take it because we have no options!https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/rejecttenderofferpublictoprivate.asp
Finally seeing some volume and a bit of price movement. Not much to hang my hat on but looking like a little life is back.
"Can someone be kind enough on this board that knows about Bitcoin, tell me if Bitcoin is more valuable than Gold and Silver?"
"Have they Continued the Stock repurchase program, going forward.?? (Yes / No....and if so...How much can be spent, until when.??)"
DO NOT BUY the US Stocks in this MEGA BUBBLE!The Valuations are ABSURD! A Heavy Correction is imminent!The US Market will COLLAPSE BIG TIME very soon!$AAPL $AMZN $JMP $TSLA
"Ummm.... why hasn't the February 15th Interest on the 7.25% senior notes literally been posted yet.?? (per the issue's prospectus) DTCc says that they haven't gotten the money yet, from the paying agency (is that US BANK.?) ... hummm..."
JMPNZ reached an all time high at 23.68
Always pumping in premarket and aftermarket. During the regular trading day hours it's not really desired.
4.80s to 4.90 WOW.... that's a big dividend yield now-a-days. *But is it safe (with financial health of the company)....Or what about those preferred shares.... (safe?)...
The nice thing about $JMP is that they are already in a correction if one comes.
Decent earnings out today. CEO hinted of a strong 4th quarter... lots of potential deals nearly finalized. Sure seems like the reward-to-risk is intriguing with the stock at 2.55/share.
"I'm sorry i dropped this to 5.27 today with my limit order, but I'll love it later "
"GOOD RIDDANCE : the press release had the guts to say, ""Mack helped chart the strategic direction for a highly successful investment banking franchise, setting an example as an accomplished advisor to corporate clients."" BAHAHAHAHA He created NO shareholder long-term value.!!"
"I see that Webush Securites keeps nibbling on JMP shares. According to my math, they now own about 10% of the shares. Hoping JMP moves up big ahead of next earnings report... as we all remember the gigantic move up after the stellar earnings last quarter from JMP. If they deliver two straight blowout earnings reports, surely the market will start to notice."
"Earnings tank.... but ""Weâ€™re very proud of our first-quarter results, as they represent a continuation of the terrific momentum we built during such a successful 2020"""
"well....looks like the company is buying back from shareholders around 14% of the company's stock..... I guess THAT puts a ""ceiling"" on the price until the end of June."
maybe jmp group will be bought out by a more aggressive financial firm with targets that all fiduciaries have to meet or they get booted. .
Any thoughts on the law firms trying to investigate the acquisition?
"Isn't the stock repurchase plan, that IS being executed, really reducing the number of outstanding shares by quite a bit.? Does anyone Know the % of shares that has been actually reduced over the last 2 years.?? Is it like a 5% reduction in outstanding shares, or 10%, or more..."
This gonna hit $15 end of today
"battered today, anyone thinks it will climb back? maybe a short squeeze eod?"
Any guesses on what the divy will be?
What Is Going One.??? only 1 trade today for 272 shares.?? why is there no REAL trading going on.??
ONLY 44 Million Market Cap. seems like it's a Tee Tiny company now-a-days.
Market Manipulation At-It's-Finest.... for the common shares today.
"Yikes, latest press release says they are being delisted..."
Holy buckets!!!
JMP reached a 52 Week high at 3.45
Any concerns (or thoughts) about their Financial Ability to pay the Interest on these exchange traded notes.... like the 8% Notes due in 2023.?
JMP reached a 52 Week low at $4.59
"no interest in the stock , guess this would be great investment before market tanks"
"If I am reading Air B#$%$ recently filed S-1, it looks like JMP is mentioned as one of the companies that assisted with them going public. Makes sense... given the CEO's remarks on the recent earnings call. Should bode for another strong quarter! Things are looking up for JMP. Finally!!"
looks like blowstocks is putting out buy signal
This should see a good run tomorrow
"Wow. no conversations here really.... even on earning release dates..... ""quiet little company"""
"WELL GUYS, 10$+ EASY TOMORROW"
