What’s a good entry here? And what will patent settlement do to stock price?
somebody bought 4 shares premarket at 13.01. if this can get to at least 30 somehow they will make 68 bucks before commissions. nice....
"I don't have this stock but wish I did. i just came here because I just love to see a great short squeeze. Love to see the shorts get roasted. With their losses in Tesla and now PBYI, hopefully they wont have as much money to drive down other people's investments. Burn shorties burn"

"$15 a share in less than six months. Very few new patient starts combined with high discontinuation rate and low clinical benefit. Buyout will occur when the commercial organization cannot fund itself at pennies on the dollar. Cash burn rate is unsustainable and very little traction among breast cancer specialists. Do what you want with your $$, but don’t spend it here looking for a home run."
"Before anyone pops any corks, can someone explain why management refused to answer two direct questions regarding new patients per month??? It was the one question anyone following the company wanted answered after the unexplained dip last quarter, and it was asked by two analysts today. Both times management said “I don’t have that in front of me”. YOU DON’T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF YOU??? Any senior manager at Puma who doesn’t know those numbers (which are the single most critical numbers in gauging the long term viability of the company) should be fired for incompetence, and any senior manager who knows those numbers and intentionally refuses to provide them on a public conference call is doing something close to fraud. On the prior conference call, the CEO said he couldn’t explain why the new patient number dipped in April. And he said he would monitor the subsequent numbers and report on any negative trend. On today’s call, guess what? The monthly new patient numbers were gone(!), replaced by a blended number that management refused to break out. Now why would they remove those numbers? Could it possibly be because the downward trend had continued? I can tell you one thing, after the attention paid to the dip on the last call, if the trend had reversed, it would have been highlighted in bold letters on slide #1. Can you imagine if Reed Hastings said he didn’t know how many new subscribers Netflix had in the past quarter, or if Elon Musk said he didn’t know how many Model 3 orders they received? I suspect Puma management knew exactly what the new patient numbers were for the past three months, and they refused to tell investors in response to two direct questions. What would you call that?"
Give me $50 and I am out ....buying this from $270
Major classic short squeeze today with huge volume.
"As usual market converting good news to bad for underperforming stock and bad to good for outperforming stock.They generate adjusted profit, net cash flow, grow q over q , beat revenue target and addressing side effect concerns without overspending on marketing and yet market look at as there is no future."
someone please explain this action! longs only
"Puma was founded by Alan Auerbach, remember... he sold Cougar to Johnson & Johnson for 1 Billion all cash back in 2009. He will sell Puma for 2 Billion 100%."

"I added 8K stock (60%+ in my IRA as My main account running low in buying power). Also add BLUE, MDGL,CLVS, BMRN.I was not trading in IRA almost entire year as I was not finding reasonable price stock and Glad I can't short ( I can buy Call and Put but that is not for retirement account) So I still have lot of buying power in IRA accounts. So I can take advantage of Market mispricing and fear of politics.Politics fear is way overdone I think and I don't think anyone want to see Biotech industry get crushed. They are life saver. You should not kill life saver for money which fed can print limitless and at end worth nothing."
I think it can get to 21 today
Neratinib is on its way to doing over $200 -225 million in 2021. With the right marketing partner could be at $500 million in two years. Worth at least a $100 dollar per share in a takeover.
I'm hearing this is a recall... News Pending
Wonder if JP Morgan will revise their $23 price target today....
"Only computers trading with each other now. 200-300 shares at a time. Whoever wanted to buy, sell, panic buy or panic sell - is DONE. Big buyers (or big sellers) will need some time to assess further movement - so the stock will move 20% or more in next few days. Likely upwards. I had a sell order at $19.82 for 500 shares (bot at $18.60). Watched the ticker - the computers took forever - reaching 19.81 (a penny less) at least 5 times before yielding. No celebration. I also have one lot at $23.96. Will keep."
"A buyout could be a possibility??, the way PBYI is holding today shows the stock will go up or a buyout could happen. No doubt China is a big market sales will go up looks cheap at this level."
404 million cap now. glad I didn't buy on this down trend. something is very wrong with a market cap this low. it's trading like peak world wide sales about 135 million now. pray it bottoms around 9.
Priced like a failure at $500M+. It has $200M+ in cash; over $200M in current sales. License revs. from ex US sales starting soon. Sure it's a one trick pony but sales do exist.
"I just can't figure out this stock, why the volatility after yesterday's news"
Nobody is interested in this company. Not even to consider buying even at a price below $8. What does that tell you?.

"5 years ago today, this stock was at $200. Happy anniversary. Welcome to the R&D Bio sector... You can pull up the 5-year chart on almost anyone of them and they look like this. But when they get this cheap...some, the ones with successful research, can move up big in a hurry. Tricky game."
"Too uncertain about Puma going into earnings this week. The decline in new Nerlynx patients this past April could be a blip, or a big problem. If steady growth in new Nerlynx patients has resumed this quarter, I’ll get back in. European approval should be coming any day."
"FDA approval = 5% decline. Good buying opportunity. I did, bought 2K shares"
Yahoo has 7 analysts with average $53M - range $51 to $57M. At this point costs/cash burn will also be a major consideration.
What's happening???
What is interesting that options don't have activity as this going up. and trading volume is low.
I’m holding 700 shares @ $231/share...hopeless.
volume traded pretty low and day traders seen rushing out which is good and stock stabilizing at these levels and holding on to good amt of the gains formLast week —-want to see it closing above 13 this week for the next leg up next week so that break out stays intact! Good luck to Longs!!!
Q4 2017 net sales increase: 14 million. Q1 2018 net sales increase: 15.9 million. Q2 2018 net sales increase: 14.8 million. What’s the problem? What are they not happy with?
Without a doubt the best biotech in this market
why doesn't pbyi CEO buy shares like clvs ceo
"I continue research on PBYI as While I wasn't sure weather this will go 50+, I was confident that it will not go lower than 35 (About $1.25B valuation given $200M+ run rate already) but turn out wrong big time.So here is my result by point which cause Analyst target drops.1.> Doctor may not prescribing after seeing side effect. I think this is furthest from truth. When I search patient blog, most doctor warn upfront about side effect. They clearly want to start patient on this drug and many blog as up front as 1-2 month before they going to start their treatment. In other word, fear about not enough new patient starting drug to replace patient leaving is not found. I even come across where someone getting perjeta going to start on this. So doctor may still give it given recurrence is dangerous. 2.> No one will continue 12 month+ treatment. While company disclose about 130 continued which is about 30% of patient population, After extensive search, look like that's likely even less % in future with larger population. Clearly side effect has significant impact on life and most patient seems eager to get off meds. They blog about last month with lot more happiness.3.> Perjeta will take market share:- Sure Perjeta will used. But I don't think doctor won't consider Nerlynx even after combo. Reason:- Perjeta efficiency only 11% after 3 year compare to placebo arm. This is significant. Herceptin damage heart so doctor don't prescribe more than 1 year. With Perjeta they only improve 11% vs with Nerlynx 29%, They will still se Nerlynx as option after treatment for Perjeta. I come across two different patient blog who starting on Nerlynx after Perjeta.Given 11% improvement, both Insurance and doctors are resistance. They likely prefer Nerlynx.4.> Patient may not able to tolerate and may discontinue given limited benefit. Furtherest from truth. While I come across 1 post where she asking forum on opinion given her chance of recurrence is 5% only after Herceptin, Majority discuss how they trying to survive from very bad side effect so they can complete 1 year. Even some who end up not continuing, didn't bash drug, instead said not for her. This is important because this define how important for Patient that Cancer does not return back. It's more important and message is clearly reduce chance by another 25% as message and not 2-4% in absolute term. Remember if cancer recur, it likely become Metastatic and that's not curable even with so much advancement in treatment.So Many who think just like placebo need to look different way. recur chance of <9% vs 12+% is significant difference."
probably a mistake. but I bought at 7.94. thank God it's only money. I'm still puzzled at 2 things .. why market cap is this low and why CEO hasn't been thrown out.
Good news due on Monday .. sure to hit 60+
"Its a puzzle why management didn't seek an SPO and tap the market in Spring, after their Q4 report and hares above $40,Either they 1) were unprepared for an SPO, as concerns regulatory fillings, 2) didn't foresee the need for additional funds, 3) didn't think that $40 reflected the true value of the company, 4) didn't force the decline in sales, 5) never expected that shares would fall over 70%.Probably all of the above in various fractions of incompetence...."
"Nektar wasn’t the only casualty among Choi’s coverage. He separately downgraded shares of beleaguered Puma Biotechnology Inc. to sell from neutral and slashed his price target to $8 from $24. Potential competition for the company’s cancer drug Nerlynx is an underappreciated investor risk, he said. The stock fell 18% Tuesday and has lost 82% in the last year."
Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a sell rating and a target of $42. Saw the mention at Seeking Alpha.Kel.......a holder
Where is the bottom. Why is anyone selling at this loss?

I am out of job and if this stock does not do much today I totally get it ..it's out of options just last week .. give it some time folks.
When is CHMP expected to meet on this again? I understand they are expected to vote in their next meeting.

"Reason for sell off:-Continued growth, $22M+ gross selll in October, very low cash burn, Non-Gaap profit (Which exclude stock based compensation and no other item), break even or slightly possitve cashflow in Q4, $120M+ cash on hand, Slight slowdown in growth. So if this is reason to sell off with 48% cut, I think entire market should get same."
"this is from march with sales of 61MM. geez, we're way oversold. Cantor Fitzgerald Bumps Puma Biotechnology Price Target On Strong Nerlynx Sales11:23 am ET March 1, 2019 (Benzinga) PrintPuma Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ: PBYI) announced fourth-quarter results and 2019 guidance Thursday that were ahead of expectations, boosting confidence in Nerlynx achieving a global product revenue estimate of $683 million in 2023, according to Cantor Fitzgerald.The Analyst Cantor Fitzgerald’s Alethia Young maintained an Overweight rating on Puma Biotechnology and raised the price target to $57.The Thesis The LA-based pharmaceutical company reported strong fourth-quarter results, with U.S. Nerlynx sales of $61 million handsomely beating the consensus expectation of $53 million. Puma Biotechnology guided to 2019 U.S. Nerlynx sales of $255-$280 million, exceeding the consensus estimate of $238 million.This was the company’s first cash flow-positive quarter, recorded at around $8 million, Young said in a Thursday note.Based on its performance in fourth-quarter, the annual run rate for the breast cancer drug is around $240 million, the analyst said. The 2019 guidance implies 6-17 percent growth, which could prove conservative, she said.“We expect the company will frame growth in terms of bottles from here on, as contribution from spec distribution channel seem to have increased,” Young said, projecting U.S. net sales of $269 million for 2019.Price Action Puma Biotechnology were rallying 36.14 percent higher to $37.86 at the time of publication Friday."

The market opportunity I’m the US alone justifies much higher valuations so whatever the deal with Canada is that doesn’t change the story. This will see 50 again doubt it will be 100 but 45-65 range is my view
"I can't believe that there aren't any institutional investors that are not demanding the resignation of the CEO, who single-handedly destroyed his company's value by 97% over 7 years. Auerbach and his leadership team must go!"
"Is the share price drop today manipulation? With the huge volume today, it is virtually impossible to manipulate the stock price. Simply put, some shareholders want out at any price and that is why the price is plunging. But it soothes the soul to say the stock is manipulated as it deflects blame from the shareholder. If you are in the price manipulation group, keep that thought for the reality will blow your mind."
Wait and see...or
"melt down, must be a dilution coming after hours or private offering. This thing can't get out of its own shadow."
"Appears that CEO’s talk at JP conference yesterday had little to no affect. I notice the new posts about buyout occurring. Puma reported flat sales, and Metastatic study was a wash since there wasn’t any statistical significance. Notice the other buyouts were of companies with a successful commercial product and or significant technology, or promising pipeline. Since Puma doesn’t have a pipeline, no technology, and little hope of increased sales into metastatic area. I’d bet the worst isn’t over yet."
amazing only a 400 million market cap. trades at something like 1 x peak sales.
looks like giving back all the after quarter results gain. glad I didn't get tricked into buying.
camber capitol mgt just bought 2.4MM shares of PBYI or 6.1% per 13G
Declining price from here on out until next quarterly reporting comes in ahead of target.
"People look at number of bottle sold and say they still have side effect issue. They fail to understand that doctor tried patient and found side effect hard to manage and many give up, this is reason sell start going down. Now with updated label and incremental dose seems lower side effect, Bottle count is start raising which mean they getting more doctor prescribe more patient. If side effect remain issue they would continue drop as doctor stop recommending and patient resist to take it.It might got false start but that does not mean it's failure. They openly accept challenges they facing and adjusting including cash burn. I think this will turn out great investment."
There seems to be little to no interest in this stock. what did I miss
Started position. Might starting bit early but I don't think you can timed it right unless very lucky.
An interesting way to look at this stock here... https://fdaheadlines.com/puma-biotechnology-inc-nasdaqpbyi-dives-as-nerlynx-gets-left-in-the-toolbox/
What’s going on? Yesterday after market was 15%down today early pre market 12%down and now recover
Nice Canadian approval! Let’s see how much this can move the stock and finally bring about a serious buyout!
"1yr target estimate is for $89.50, currently we are mid year wrapping up FY18 Q3. With today's Bull shares coupled with the EU possible approval with Neratinib to begin sales in the very near future, I'm confident the new support should be building itself for the $89 mark. I say all this firmly believing that today's shareholders are as unpredictable as a 16 yr old looney girl that is a habitual gambler. GTLA."

"From June 21st 2019. See Ph III Nala portion of interview. I'm beginning to think there is a short attack on PBYI vs. its falling because people in the know are selling. Makes sense. We'll see. ""Sara Tolaney, MD, MPH, associate director, Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and assistant professor of medicine, Harvard Medical School, discussed new combination treatments for patients with breast cancer at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting.The MONALEESA-7 study, a phase III trial, evaluated the responses of premenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer to receiving ribociclib (Kisqali), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, with endocrine therapy. Overall survival (OS), evaluated after 173 deaths, was greater in patients treated with ribociclib and endocrine therapy rather than placebo and endocrine therapy; the median OS was not reached versus 40.9 months, respectively. Estimated OS rates at 42 months for ribociclib/endocrine therapy versus placebo/endocrine therapy were 70.2% versus 46%, respectively. Ribociclib paired with endocrine therapy saw a 29% decline in deaths compared with placebo and endocrine therapy, Tolaney said.The SOPHIA study, a randomized phase III trial, compared margetuximab versus trastuzumab (Herceptin), each combined with chemotherapy, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer after prior anti-HER2 therapies. Researchers found margetuximab prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) over trastuzumab at a median 5.8 versus 4.9 months, respectively. In 524 patients with baseline measurable disease, margetuximab had a better overall response rate (ORR) at 22% compared with trastuzumab at 16%. The effects of treatment were more pronounced in patients with CD16A genotypes containing a 158F allele. Although the outcomes were similar, margetuximab may offer benefits over trastuzumab, especially for patients who have CD16A genotypes.The randomized, phase III NALA trial compared the combinations of neratinib (Nerlynx) and capecitabine (Xeloda) versus lapatinib (Tykerb) and capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated by ≥2 HER2-directed regimens. Of the 621 patients, the risk of disease progression was reduced by 24% with neratinib rather than lapatinib. Additionally, in neratinib versus lapatinib, 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 47.2% versus 37.8% and 28.8% versus 14.8%. OS rates for neratinib versus lapatinib at 6- and 12-months were 90.2% versus 87.5% and 72.5% versus 66.7%. An extremely interesting aspect, according to Tolaney, was the time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system disease (overall cumulative incidence 22.8% vs 29.2%) was delayed with neratinib versus lapatinib. Researchers found that neratinib combined with capecitabine greatly improved PFS and seemed to improve OS versus lapatinib and capecitabine. Tolaney said it will be a challenge to integrate the neratinib and capecitabine into practice because “there are now so many HER2 therapies in this [third-line] setting.”"
$250m market cap with $200m revenue cancer drug
"“We remind investors that in the first quarter of 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines were updated to include Nerlynx as a recommended combination treatment option for breast cancer patients with brain metastases. Most physicians use the NCCN guidelines to determine the best course of treatment for their cancer patients. Investors will be keen to know if sales of Nerlynx picked up in the second quarter.” - This is from the most recent article on PBYI from Zacks. I’m not scared"
"PBYI will be in the mid $60's this summer. Given the revenue forecast of aound $300 millions. Let's calculate the share price:($300 mil x 7.5) / 38.5 million shares = $58.44--This is revenue along for the approved product. There will be revenue from the drug to be approved in China, Israel, Australia, etc... and the pipeline are worth around $10/share.With this, we will see PBYI at around $65-70 this summer. Hold your shares tight and don't listen to the shorts."
Where is QUO hiding ?????
"25% of float is short. With $250 million in revenue and market cap of $450, and progress on fda, seems like Puma has the potential to pop. $100+ million cash in hand. What am I missing?"

Just read the earnings report. Sales met target and improved. Costs were reduced. Loss is reduced. Company seems to be working on improving sales. Fairly - the stock price drop last few months already baked in the slow adoption of their pill. Unless conf call screws up something - this is $10+ tomorrow. And if adoption increases - we can $20 later this year. GLTA
PBYI is up 9.31% to 67.50
We all know how does it move ..It could be $20.00 with one good news ..
Still no news! There has to be something to support this increase and volume of shares changing hands. Wouldn’t this amount of shares mean the institutional holders have been selling too?
new collaboration agreement and nothing. can't wait till this thing wakes up
finally broke 7 again. Wish the CEO would sell the company. Oncology is hot. He should be able to get a good price.
now it is up
"here is the problem. the reputation is that the product is too toxic for people take. When word gets out to the other doctors, they won't even recommend it to their patients."
From $200 plus to $6 then from $7 to $14. I wish from &12 to $20 then $40/$50. Eventually all shorts will disappear from this board. IMO
PBYI will be bought out for $20 easily.Gl!
$CLVS and $PBYI board need to actively look for buyer. Their stock price so low with promising drug that they likely have significant interest.
The unremitting value destruction on Auerbach's watch is astounding. Exactly 7 years ago this stock was $270/share and now is below $7/share - 97% decline. I wonder if the CEO's salary has seen a similar decrease since 2014. He and Puma's leadership are an absolute disgrace.
news after the bell. stock up to 11.83. closed at 11.49. data sounds good. do we hit 12 tomorrow?
Patent was mentioned on the conference call. Does any body know how the patent will impact the bottom line?

I hope the CEO sell this to a bigger player
anybody think this is in buyout radar now. big pharma could now pay 40 or 1.6 Billion for the whole company.
almost unimaginable that a stock that was in triple digits has been reduced to an 8 dollar stock. nothing else to say but truly amazing.
Sell on the news! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/puma-biotechnology-licensing-partner-knight-203400069.html
"All the sentiment is negative...which may very well be a positive!Few recall their May 2019 Commercial update presentation (10 slides) which indicated that April 2019 sales (bottles) was 1600 units, compared to 4400 in Q1. That’s a scant data point, and we have no indications for subsequent months. But it is not unreasonable to expect that’s Q2 sales (bottles) will be at least at the Q1 level.If that is verified in next weeks call, and if the international launch dates remain firm, then there is good reason to expect shares to see a relief rally...which could be quite violent given the short volume now in play. This isn’t to ignore downside risks, but with market cap now down to $350M, with positive net cash position, the shares are selling at about 1.5 revenues.They do have a cancer treatment drug, approved, on the market, with international partners. They have an NDA in the works, and are making progress on a more tolerable version of their drug."
Guess the stock price on 9 August (earning After Hours 8 Aug)
"Pretty sure company won’t be bought at a premium if bought at all. It’s product nerlynx doesn’t treat active disease, and there isn’t a pipeline / R&D at Puma (like TSRO comparison). Nerlynx niche application is preventative only, without a clinical marker. Payers and Doctors don’t like guessing, and you can’t tell who’ll respond. It’s like pulling a handle on a medical slot machine that’s $11K+ per monthly yank. The data for the double negative (ER-/ PR-) hormone patients washed out too. No benefit there, and those patients are the ones who need the most help. Not the ER+ PR+ patients by comparison. That’s why the product has no growth, losing ground every earnings report, and shrinking support from the medical community. There are also products in clinical trials that are already making nerlynx even less relevant. Investing capitol into nerlynx near term has no long term value for another company, but I wish you luck recovering you lost investment."
"Looks like CLVS all over. Beware, but good luck."
"What you guys are missing is the press release from Chicago. They studied loperamide, other drugs, and just presented the results of using dose escalation and low dose loperamide as needed. The results of that looked excellent. If that method manages the side effects, it could be a game changer for the drug, sales, and stock. I’m bullish based on that. Plus the other trial they presented seemed positive as well."
pbyi and clvs has by far the worst management in approved cancer drug stocks.

"Analysts at Morgan Stanley highlight cancer drug Tagrisso as a key growth driver for the company. Sales of the drug increased by 16% quarter-on-quarter in the 2Q, largely thanks to growth in Japan, Europe, and emerging markets. This quarter, analysts at the investment bank are forecasting sales of $828 million, which translates to 65% growth year on year. They also are expecting an update on DS-8201, the research-stage cancer asset that Astra is developing in partnership with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. (4568.TO). if they do have patent rights, they won't shut it down. they will get royalties (at least 15%) or about 125MM a quarter. PBYI's income just skyrocketed. When sales were 100MM a Q, we were 35 to 40. This is way past that."
"While today there likely some pressure from margin calls, I am hoping some recovery. I think key is market is clearly large enough.While given side effect I think they only able to get about 30% of herceptin at peak. Herceptin sell at $7B rate world wide which mean market is as large as $1.5B-$2B easily.Remember side effect is bad but recurrence can be fatal. Many patient specially below 60 likely strong enough to deal with side effects."
I can feel a great earnings and a pop of $10 to $12.00 by closing on 2/20/2020. I did ride it about six months ago from $29 to $42.00. It was a great surprise that morning with a pre open at about $4 bucks. Great decision at 850 share!
"Thinking of getting back in at a small position, do you see it hitting teens in 6 months? Trying to figure out whether to buy now, which I’m leaning towards.Thanks for your input."
"Since they got expansion label approval last month or so, it will help on the revenue."
Anyone remember what the jump/volume was like when they reported Q1 earnings - Feb 28?? Could we see a 50% jump tomorrow?? 60%???
18 million shares trades already today !!! That's the most shares traded in a single UP day ever. Ever ! In the entire history of PBYI.There are only 40 million shares outstanding. And there were 8 million shares short a few days ago !That's huge. This is big. What else could it be but a buyout to get those Patents?$20/share is near...
Good time to buy now
Did anyone listen to the cantor conference. Seemed like the tone of ceo was he didn’t care and they are very challenged with maintaining patients on the drug. Any thoughts?
I can't believe the selling from HOD. This can open in the 20's to 40's Monday. Just amazing.
Go to PUMA website! Listen to web cast. FDA to meet with PUMA 4th qtr 2021 pre-NDA meeting for accelerated approval Neratinib combo trial
"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PBYI/insider-transactions?p=PBYICEO sells shares at $12.78. Yes, PBYI will go under 8 for sure."
"At this time, the only thing that is going to move this is sales. No pipeline, no updates. Can only hope sales pick up with these additional country approvals. I'd just like to make back what i invested in this stock at this point, rather than remain down by 55%."
"Main question about PBYI is will it become standard of care after Herceptin. I am reading various blogs posted by patient (There aren't enough public info to make judgement but activity and post tell you detail.)For example:- When I search just Sep 2019, I find 3 patient indicated either just started or going to start.Also more important is how MD think. I read some MD suggest it's must, Other said Not required. Now as they realize that it reduce recurrence by 25%+ in real practice they might change opinion. After reading I can say following1.> % of MD getting on board growing which is very good news. 2.> Chance patient continue beyond 1 year is very unlikely even after label change3.> Many lately not complaining about side effect this mean diarra treatment help lower intensity and working, Label expansion sure going to help further.I think it will slowly become standard of care. I think any big pharma with oncology focus not try buyout is pain stupid. They can grab this company for as little as 1-1.5B easily. With label expansion this is well worth it. Remember they don't have marketing cost as much as PBYI and so it add into earning.Let's see what happen. One thing sure, it's very cheap and given they didn't try to issue more stock, They either confident about finance or already working on some good offer.Let's hope best."
"CLVS acting like buyout. Huge volume, and rumor mill is stating a hiring freeze is on. 2 positive indicators. Chevy might be right for once!"
Heading to 44.60 and then a close at the low of the day. Typical Friday playbook created by the Crewks on Wall Street. Nothing changes. Same old story in biotech.This wouldn't happen if this was a software stock or Tesla or MSFT or GOLDMAN SACHs.
4 million shares in one hour of trading and not a single piece of news anywhere. This should be illegal
"I know the shorts are complaining that Puma just went up $15.00 over two days on miniscule sales, but if we look at the big picture we are beginning to see oncologist see the benefits of this drug with a pretty good side effect profile. They have the diarrhia under control no pun intended. I see Nerlynx sales for 2018 coming in about $105-$115 million. 2019 guidance $220 million. See takeover around $190 per share."
"￼Why These Breast Cancer Study Results Look So PromisingBy Chris Lange December 12, 2019 9:15 am ESTPuma Biotechnology Inc. (NASDAQ: PBYI) shares made a handy gain early on Thursday after the company presented updated results from its Phase 2 Summit clinical trial of neratinib at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS).Neratinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy and is marketed in the United States.￼Overall, the study has so far demonstrated encouraging clinical activity with durable responses in this heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patient population. By the looks of it, management will continue enrollment in this cohort of the study.The interim efficacy summary of the breast cohort that received neratinib in combination with trastuzumab and fulvestrant showed that for the 17 efficacy evaluable patients, nine patients (53%) experienced a confirmed objective response, all of which were classified as partial responses, and 10 patients (59%) experienced clinical benefit.Alan H. Auerbach, CEO and president of Puma Biotech, commented:We are very pleased with the activity seen with neratinib in combination with trastuzumab and fulvestrant in this cohort of patients with HER2-mutated breast cancer. We are in the process of expanding this HR-positive breast cancer cohort in SUMMIT with the intent of using this data to support future registration. We look forward to enrolling additional patients into this HR-positive breast cancer cohort in order to generate the additional data required to support approval of this combination therapy.Shares of Puma Biotech closed Wednesday at $8.69, in a 52-week range of $6.26 to $43.90. The consensus price target is $12.13. Following the announcement, the stock was up over 3% in early trading indications Thursday."
"Where is our Chevy? At this very special time, how can Chevy disappear?"
We close above $34 tomorrow. And then other news in a a couple of months will drive above $50 again.
I guess the market is still hoping for buyout. I see nothing wrong with the deal. adds 60 million up front. another 345 million in milestones and double digit royalties.

"Here is PBYI partnership that enter this year. This is for all those who think it's dead drugEU 60M upfront, 345M in milestone + Significant double digit royalty (Part of which then paid to Pfizer) Likely still left with higher single digit.Canada:- Upto 7.2M + double digit royaltyChina:- 30M upfront + upto 40M milestone + signficant double digit royaltySo my simple question is Why so many ready to partner with PBYI and ready to pay so much upfront for dead drug?"

Where is Quo ????
"I am flabbergasted why this is even down pre-market. Granted they dont have next blockbuster, but we are talking about under 600 million company. They have stabilized sales at 250 million run rate, have several catalysts this year, they are cash flow neutral with 111 million cash, chance of windfall $ from patent dispute, M&A possibility etc."
$200m per year breast cancer drug worth only $272m. Is the fair value?
"Why are there posts stating “big earnings beat”, they missed. PB lost > 100 million / last Q. It’s their first earnings miss since launching the product. Also, without the one time 10 million royalty payment mentioned. The sales would’ve been negative, or flat Q/Q. PB appears to keep cutting operating expenses to boost revenues looking at the report. Not using sales, or able to use their product sales to boost revenue. The + 10% price increase will help product revenue next earnings cycle, but won’t change the volume of prescriptions. That has to be slow, or flat looking at Q/Q sales they reported. I’m glad the stocked popped. I just don’t envision it running with the inability to create > sales revenue. My guess is the 30s will be their new home for the foreseeable future if overall market and IBB remain stable."
"Note this trial is conducted by competitor Roche (RHHBY), NOT by Puma. Primary endpoint was met March 2, 2017. Data released June 5, 2017 - HR 0.81.

"Newbie here.(Thinking to buy some shares).I've read something from website, sec filings etc....But we know not everything is there.Can anybody share some thought? I see shares at all time lows, an approved drug..... it's not clear to me.Thanks"
tsro gets 6 billion. pbyi shoukd be worth the same.
Overall survival is not great. Once again the data shows slightly improved performance over the standard of care but with bad side effects (diahrea). They’ll gain only a small portion of the current market
I was tempted to buy 17 or 18 a while back. so glad I didn't. seriously thinking of grabbing shares in the 12s
"This stock is quite undervalue.Company doing everything right, Very likely their label going to expand soon. They able to maintain sells even analyst create fear like no one want drug due to side effect. Overall this is great stock to own at this price. Price under pressure only because Short control Biotech market and This stock is easy target for them for time being. If they able to bring $55M+ sell next Q (Analysis says $60M revenue but it might include milestone as well) I think this will go in 20's atleast. Should trade 30's or even 40's."
Shorts will likely be in control in the next session and this would likely drop and I had be hunting for $10 calls with expiration four months out—-diarhoea issue is a real one and recommendation with lowering drug dosage is addressing it effectively prolonging the drug usage period ...new prescribers data is positive and Jan references augurs well...q4.19 10% ( plz don’t mislead folks) over q3.19...I would expect q1.20 is going to to be setting up for a huge 30% revenue increase over q4.19 huge beat on topOf the fda approval..Trial design shd keep costs low and get to the arms that matter fairly quickly as each arm is getting 7 pts!!!What do you guys think?
Will it stop bleeding? What management of Puma is doing without taking any action of stopping beeld?
I am long and a big fan that believes this should see 60-70 levels again but would like to understand the potential impact of soon to be approved Kadcyla in that setting on Puma. I am struggling to understand the logic which may need to be applied in regards to pragmatism - thinking that doctors have no incentive to deal with hundreds of grade 3 situations caused by neratinib versus better tolerability of Kadcyla? Doctors prefer the easy way I would think. And i am wondering if there is a commercial sense for doctors to choose kadcyla because it’s an infusion where they buy the infusion for 50% less than for what they sell it and also probably can charge 1 k per infusion versus using a pill (reduced revenue source)? I am not an expert but would like to hear a view if we can go higher in Puma from this recovery even if kadcyla May blow neratinib out of the water? Again I am long term holder for years and can handle volatility but like to get some more views from people who understand it better.
"The USPTO has allowed two patent applications (11/883474 and 15/207349) that are exclusively licensed to PBYI. The patent applications appear to cover AZN's Tagrisso, and may entitle PBYI to claim a royalty on AZN's sale of Tagrisso."
Article was confusing today. Puma earnings to decline 2nd quarter revenue was 54 million this quarter estimate is app 60 million if they say bring in 58 better then q2 but misses 60 estimate How does that make revenue decline ?
"what is wrong with PBYI today?? geez, can't shorts leave one stock alone??"
More good news is coming!!!
It will run to 16 after results..
2022 pbyi will return to profitability..
This is the market is where strong gets stronger and weak gets weaker. PBYI will be dissolved
zigzag chart. but its on upside.lets see if Monday this will be zig up.
WOW! definitely the time to start shorting
"PBYI true value with some assumption in case of buyout.First Assumption:-USA Peak patient per year treatment :- 8000 ( With 2000 discontinued due to side effect) = Net 6000.(Anyone hoping that patient will continue more than 1 year, unlikely given side effect. Infact it's better company focus on 1 year treatment and not market like multi year because that only going to get pushback from doctors and more importantly patient who don't want to live with sideeffect for life )Rest of World USA equivelent patient per year treatment :- 6000( with 1500 likely discontinued due to side effect) = Net 4500Total 10500 peak yearly script.Total Revenue:- $1.2B-$1.5B peakProfit:- Given they can generate profit with just 1500 patient:- About $800m to $1B.Time to peak sale:- 3 year for USA, 5 year for rest of world So let's use 5 year for being conservative.Multiple:- 10x earning = $8B-10B at peak saleNow let's discount 20% yearly:- Value = $3.2B -$4B.Let give 25% discount for uncertainty:- Still worth $2.3B to $3.2B.Current Market cap:- 900M. So if Any pharma looking to buy, They will value more than 2x possibly 3x from current level. TSRO got nearly 3x from low and it's possible here as well.Once tax loss season end, this will strongly recover. I might loss half of my stock to tax loss selling although I have less reason to claim tax loss now given solid profit in TSRO that I only going to book next year. Means I can claim tax loss against that as well in next year.I have to decide claiming tax loss is important or aggressive trading and profit while stock price remain low and volatile is better option."
"The 19's have arrived as expected. The Street was short PBYI ahead of the Call. CEO, are you short your stock? What company representative would say patients are FOREGOING treatment? The sales numbers should speak for themselves. This sector REEKS with CORRUPTION. That 5 year price chart proves it."
I don't get this stock. One day it's climbing Mt. Everest and going higher till the close and then the next day it's down the tubes on low volume like it's going out of business. Why can't management see the obvious and sell out to a larger pharma firm as they can't do it alone. Can they be that blind???
I literally could have sold my entire portfolio June 1st and shorted every stock that I owned and would be up over 100 percent! Rough summer for sure!
I suspect the down trend is related to another poor quarter. The market usually knows ahead of the retail investors. You think you are getting a good deal sub $10 and then BAM! another poor earnings call and before you know it the stock is at $5. The stock has no support now on a multiyear technical chart as it is skidding to historic lows.
"Perhaps we should all write to Puma's Board of Directors, urging them to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to properly oversee the organization. The board members are: Allison Dorval (CFO at Voyager Therapeutics); Ann C. Miller (retired VP of Marketing at Sanofi; currently also a board member at Inovio Pharmaceuticals); Michael Miller (retired as EVP at Jazz Pharmaceuticals); Jay Moyes (CFO at Sera Prognostics); Adrian Senderowicz (senior advisor at Constellation Pharmaceuticals); Brian Stuglik (CEO of Verastem); and Troy Wilson (CEO at Kura Oncology). Of course, the inimitable CEO of Puma, Alan Auerbach is the chairman of the Board. I wonder how these individuals serve on a board of the organization that has consistently underperformed in such grotesque terms."
PBYI 20% drop today got my attention. So - the Chief Commercial Officer (Mr Lo) has accepted top dog spot at another biotech.He had been with PBYI for 4 years. Other than that - nothing has changed materially with the company since yesterday.All the positives are there. All the negatives are there.And yes Goldman Sach threw in Sell rating - so they can buy. I'm buying a bit here. High risk and high reward. This can get you a 2-3 bagger in a year.
"Buyout rumors from Pfizer swirling,,, BUY, BUY"
Why is it down after hours? Any news ?
"I think someone rich should buy $KPTI, $CLVS and $PBYI and merge them together. They bring in a little under $600m in revenue together and some products in their pipeline to form a respectable commercial stage biotech. I think with $3-5B can be done and it worth it."
"Test 6.90 today. If so, we will know if we have a winner up or down. Could be an interesting day."
"When share prices surged to low-40s in mid-March, after unexpected surge in revenues, one might have anticipated a SPO to raise fresh capital. This is the formula often seen in biotech (e.g., see HZNP in their recent actions after share price rise...).Perhaps PBYI feels that they are not in deed of capital at this time, and that they foresee (as we were told) positive cash flow to begin filling their coffers. But that seems unlikely as a sole reason.Perhaps PBYI feels that they have no need for cash because they have no intention to invest in R&D, now or in the foreseeable future. In deed, they are a 1-drug company and have indicated that their prospects are solid simply by pursuing additional indication for that drug. But even that comes at cost.Perhaps PBYI feels that their stock is still far undervalued, and share issuance even at $40/sh is dilutive given their view of the likely future share growth prospects. An investor would like this argument, but a bird-in-the-hand should never be forsaken, and the 25% share price decline since March highs suggests a lost opportunity. Perhaps PBYI is engaged in buy-out with a suitor, for which an SPO would be a distraction. Certainly, the value of their drug got a boast after the recent surprise uptick in sales. They trade at a small EV/EBITDA multiple given the ultimate peak rev of their product. They are likely on someone's radar screen, and a $2B price tag is not unrealistic.In sum: If management felt that its Q4 rev surge was unrepresentative of sustained growth prospects , it is plausible think that they would have secured additional equity funding. That they didn't do so should be viewed as a positive, imo."
"There is no such thing as a ""Value"" Biotech.For those imagining that PBYI is now a ""value"" play, forget it.Small biotech is only a ""value"" if it product has sufficient promise to warrant a suitor who would bu- out the product or company.The declining sales of its sole product, its poor efficacy rating, and its severe side effects, make it a poor product for patient and investor. Better is needed to help cancer victims, and better will be developed.PBYI is exploring the side effect issue, finding better cocktail combos with its product, but that is hardly the same as new drug development and clinical program.The cost of drug, near $100K for an annual regime, is also a huge issue, again given is poor efficacy.So, at $500M market cap, with no prospects of a suitor, and no development plan---to sell at anything more than 1x revenues, rather than the current 2.5x, is ridiculous."
Excellent
how did jp Morgan justify its 83 target today ? stock has dropped from 136 to 45 today. that's incredible.
"ouch!!! aka, Pros / Heggers have no confidence in next earnings. They know the data. It must be poor. Zacks: Investors in Puma Biotechnology, Inc. PBYI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 20, 2019 $9.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.Where is stoner bill to interpret this?"
Tail wind from BIIB could drag this puppy over 7 with IBB. QUESTION IS will it hold?
Revenue: $53M and .97 cent a share loss. Guidance tomorrow will move this stock.
Sold all @ avg 10.53 Will be back after a few days. I just have no idea where this is heading
"After buyout for other pharma, Reaction here very strong which is very positive. Let's hope earning is best. I expect good earning and script growth continue. I think after quater or two we may see buyout as well because 1.> It give normalize result so if script still growing and trend look reach 6K+ (Which I think where we peak in USA) that's enough to reach $800M in sell rate at least. This can easily valued at $4B+ (Assuming Europe sell at least half USA) based on that.Last earning fall was clearly over action which created opportunity of lifetime (I brought bunch near 20)I reduce quite a bit since JPM Health conference (From 4000 to 1200) mainly due to lack of any new info operating info in biggest health conference. I am sure I will regret selling but good side is overall I am in profit still and still have good amount of stock to benefit if stock jump after earning."
so when pbyi once traded over 200 the market didn't know of these side effects?
"PBYI sp is staying strong with 1M shares already traded , something is up with the stock ....let’s get at least $2 B in the BO"
Their full year Nerlynx guidance is still right there. 175m to 200m. Right now $123.5 million for 3 quarters. A little light but overall not too bad. I just bought this at $25.
Biotech companies are probably the only one that can waist investors money for decades and bear no responsibility for it and most important after decades of research and trails declare that they have nothing and continue asking for more money so they could waist even more. There are only small number of successful biotech delivering new cures and making progress in the field the rest of them are just wanna be.
With no analyst downgrades one has to wonder why this is continually drifting down
It dropped over 30% when negative opinion was announced. Who thinks they go 40% today?
That right. It way undervalued
"As a pro traders , I’m long by the way , I can just tell you , they (market makers )Will NOT pop PBYI at the Open. They will keep the bid down, look to force weak hands . Get Rid of the whor*s who were looking for quick pop / trade after San Anton conference . This isn’t pivotal news . Just keeps the ball moving toward expanding Application . It’s huge news if your long (LIKE US- me included)But without overwhelming demand. They will take it lower first .Don’t get sucked in and Sell/ capitulate . And I would NOT buy at the open. I would wait for about 1015am let it dip to 8.4-8.60 Get sellers out of way, see if Decent bayside volume starts to come in . Honestly we shouldn’t need any Catalyst, PBYI is trading at 1X in valuation (Current mkt Cap VS. annual revenue or cash flow )That’s where they bring the Valuation to , b4 they Get in board and drive it back to the moon (moon in this case is 14-16)By expanding CURRENT approval , Singapore , Hong King, Australia, fixing the Diarhea problem, and Filling the Vacant Sales Rep Jobs/ not missing out on Rhise regions sale.Adding countries and Having much less dropoff patient wise from diarrheaThey will be 250-300m at least.

"The FDA, on Friday, warned of rare but severe lung inflammation associated with the use of some advanced breast cancer medicines, Pfizer’s PFE Ibrance, Eli Lilly’s LLY Verzenio and Novartis’ NVS Kisqali. The FDA said that the related lung issues can prove to be fatal for the patients.The FDA approved new warnings about the inflammation risk to be added to the labels of these cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitor medicines. The FDA also approved a patient package insert for the entire class of these medicines, which work by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which interferes with the division of cancer cells and helps stop tumor growth.While shares of Pfizer declined 1%, that of Lilly and Novartis went down by 0.5% and 2.8%, respectively, on Friday.The FDA reviewed data from completed and ongoing clinical studies on CDK 4/6 inhibitors that mentioned some serious cases of patients experiencing lung inflammation issues like interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases.The FDA has asked patients using these drugs to watch for symptoms like difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath even while at rest and other worsening symptoms involving their lungs. It also instructed doctors to regularly monitor patients for symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. In patients, who have developed ILD/pneumonitis, the FDA instructed permanent discontinuation of CDK 4/6 inhibitor medicines.Nonetheless, the FDA’s safety alert emphasized that the overall benefit of these CDK 4/6 inhibitor medicines are greater than the risks. However, we believe that these additional warnings may affect sales of the three drugs, to an extent, in future quarters.While Ibrance was approved by the FDA in 2015, the other two medicines were given the green signal much later in 2017. Ibrance generated sales of $2.39 billion in the first half of 2019 while Verzenio and Kisqali, garnered sales of $243.3 million and $202 million, respectively in the same time frame. All three medicines are approved for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor to treat adults with HR+, HER2- breast cancer that is metastatic, or in other words, has spread to other parts of the body.Though several drugs with different mechanism of action are approved to treat breast cancers, a relatively newer class of drugs approved to treat the disease is PARP inhibitors like Merck MRK and AstraZeneca’s AZN Lynparza."
220 to 240 guidance 220 at low end 3x sales 660 million. why does it trade 430 million cap ? fair value right now is 15 area.

"Anyone doubt that because roche has Perjeta, it might reduce scope of Nerlynx. Read this. Sure Toxicity is problem but Company doing everything to educate doctors on subject. This is significant opportunity.Perjeta only improve by 1.7% absolute term vs Nerlynx improved 4% absolute term at 5 year data. This is more than 30% relative improvement compare to 20% relative for Perjeta. People said it's almost like placebo and so will fail but doctor prescribed it.People said due to side effect no one will prescribe after first patient, While it yet to confirmed, it will turnout wrong. Company will successful educating doctor that antidiarrheal should reduce effect and that after sometime it go away.Overall potential is quite big and at current valuation and very low burn rate, All they need is sustain sale would double stock price.https://www.curetoday.com/articles/treatment-options-expanding-in-her2positive-breast-cancer"
anyone out there ever think that this triple digit stock would ever trade in the single digits? why was the drug even approved then? Only way to make money in biotechs is by shorting.
stock is trading like peak sales under 100 million. they should take a 15 to 20 buyout if anyone willing to put up 600 to 800 million. very fair value if peak sales are 300 million

The Oncopole is officially recognized by the French government as a National Center of Excellence for cancer research. In 2015, Pierre Fabre entered into an agreement with the American biotech company, Array BioPharma, to codevelop two small molecules (kinase inhibitors), Braftovi & Mektovi. The primary indication (melanoma) was approved in September 2018 by EMA and marketing is already underway in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway and Denmark."
"When the negative trend vote was first announced the stock ranked from ~$94 to ~$64. Huge decline. Since then the share price has further declined to sub $50. With the CHMP opinion reversal to a positive trend vote, the share price ONLY reacted with a $14 pop and has since settled back down to sub $55, well below the $64 low when the neg trend vote was announced. What’s wrong with this picture?! PBYI is significantly undervalued at this level! Buy buy buy!"
still moving up. buyer knows good news and probably price so they keep buying slowly with price going up.
Chart setup looks bullish to me at the moment
Brought 1000. Sales is doing quite well. At this price no brainer. It going to sell $200M yearly rate. Drug launched just 12 month ago. This going to turn out billion dollar drug easily and when market realize long term potential this will trade 100+ very soon.
"Just read that Russell investment group just increased their holdings by 11.4%. I’ve been losing a little money lately on this one, you think it’s worth holding on to this year or at least a part of it? I like taking chances with at least one biotech, but they are hard for me to research."
GS will not let it loose
Buy now. Sell it tomo am at $28. Thank me later
in 2014 stock leaped from $58 to $270 in such short period of time and not taking any profit? gotta learn to be a smart trader people auch good luck
"Neratinib is an MST1 inhibitor and restores pancreatic β-cells in diabetesAmin Ardestani, Matthew S Tremblay, Weijun Shen, Kathrin MaedlerCell Death Discovery 5 (1), 1-3, 2019The failure of pancreatic insulin-producing β-cells is a central pathogenic hallmark of all forms of diabetes. Ninety-nine years after the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best, insulin is still the only available therapy for patients with diabetes once β-cell function is fully declined. We have not succeeded yet to establish a therapeutical intervention, which maintains and restores β-cell survival and function. Pathways and targets, which control stress response, cellular homeostasis, and the apoptosis network are consequently paralleled with tumor checkpoints and the risk to exploit them for the therapy of a chronic disease such as diabetes has so far outbalanced the promises of harnessing the power of an antiapoptotic strategy to target diabetes. At the cellular and organismal level, developmental, regenerative, antiapoptotic, as well as oncogenic pathways all share some common signaling hubs and regulatory networks. Thus, their deep understanding is absolutely required to safely target and monitor such pathways in the context of therapies. Decorated with multiple pattern recognition receptors, the pancreatic β-cell is highly sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. The necessity to survive periods of malnutrition and starvation during human evolution required highly regulated insulin secretion in tight adaptation to glucose and nutrient status. Now, overnutrition and physical inactivity fostered by Western diet and lifestyle abnormally alter glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis for which more and/or highly functional β-cells are needed to handle such metabolic imbalance. This progressive and constant high insulin demand from the β-cell leads to stress, β-cell overwork and exhaustion, degranulation, β-cell degeneration, and finally death resulting in progressive development of the relative insulin deficiency, unable to maintain normoglycemia and consequently to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Very similar in terms of consequences for the β-cell, β-cell death is thought to initiate and exacerbate immune-mediated type 1 diabetes (T1D), indicating the importance of β-cell loss in the process of T1D onset and progression.The identification of relevant molecular pathways and pathophysiological events that are responsible for β-cell demise in diabetes is instrumental for the better understanding of disease mechanisms and to ultimately address what is truly missing in diabetes: the β-cell. Through indepth studies of key elements of the apoptotic machinery, we have previously found serine/threonine kinase mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1), a core kinase of the Hippo developmental pathway, as a critical regulator of β-cell death and dysfunction in diabetes. Activated by multiple diabetogenic stimuli in human islets in vitro, in animal models of diabetes in vivo, as well as in pancreas sections obtained from patients with T2D, MST1 directly induces β-cell death and impairs insulin secretion 1 (Fig. 1). The importance of MST1 as a therapeutical target in diabetes has been confirmed at the level of the β-cell as well as for diabetic complications, ie, nephropathy and cardiomyopathy 2."

Buying more here...... way undervalued
"Here is the email I sent to the so-called ""leadership team"" at Puma + the Board members I could find the email addresses for. Of course, no response, although that's to be expected. Dear Puma Biotechnology Leadership Team & Select Board Members,I am a holder of over 15k of Puma Biotechnology shares, whose value has plummeted in the past several years. As a senior finance executive with extensive Board experience, I am wondering how the obviously dismal financial performance and poor execution by Puma's leadership team in the past several years - and ongoing! - has impacted the Puma Biotechnology Board's oversight. Just to mention a couple of stats: - Puma Biotechnology's stock has collapsed from $260 per share 7 years ago to $6.24 per share as of today. This represents a 98% decline in value in 7 years.- Market cap has gone from over $400m only 9 months ago to about $250m now - an almost 40% deterioration in just 9 months! It is evident that the leadership team of Puma has failed in achieving its strategic and tactical goals as judged by the company's accelerating market value collapse. While I understand that this isn't the sole metric to gauge success, it is indeed a critical one for a publicly traded entity. My main question to the Board is: is there any governance in place that monitors and holds Puma's executive management accountable for the strategic and operational success of the organization? Have the following questions been asked by the Board: 1) is Puma's executive management up to the task of building and operating a financially thriving company, and if not, what correctional measures have been taken; 2) given the abysmal financial performance over so many years, has there been a consideration of seeking a buyer of Puma that would be able to re-build the organization; and 3) if Puma's strategy is to remain independent, have you considered going private."
"Their cash position is about $200M, counting the recent $60M up from payment for EU rights.They have debt of about $150M.They expect 2019 revs in the range near $250M.Shares are trading at about 1.5 revenues.That is cheap by all measures, for a company having a market for a cancer treatment, that still is new to the market, has international marketing and royalty agreements, and has NDA fillings for improved formulaics and expanded indications research."
"*Puma Biotechnology shares are trading higher on continued momentum after the company reported better-than-expected Q3 EPS results.funny, as of after hours Wednesday, it was a sales miss and the stock was selling off. Geez, these guys change comments on Monday after the game is played on Sunday"

"I should have sold when it was up, I had 3 chances. Added another 2k shrs today @8.07, with 14500 shrs I am now nervous.GLTYA Longs"
Wow what a bias market. Everything great and stock move $2 up. it's joke.1.> They reduce debt2.> They control their operating cost very well.3.> R&D cost going down.4.> Label expansion in progress5.> Revenue growing again after bad 1st quarter.6.> Partnership bringing milestone payments while reducing risk on international launch.Overall great earning and great potential and yet it trading 1.5 time revenue. What a joke.
Wow I remember this stock when it was in the $100+ range after approval.
I don’t understand why wouldn’t a fund that owns this come out with an upgrade or positive research note to stop the waterfall?
"Regards to the side effect , diarrhea, patients statistically are basically NO LONGER discounting the Puma Breast cancer drug due to Diarrhea. Research it. The test results from yesterday and Today . It was proven adding the additional medication to the Dosing Drops the side effect Substantially . Meaning PUMA and Seattle are the only 2 with The Breast cancer drug that works . When the first 1 or 2 treatments don’t. Look at Seattle Generics take over of Cascadian last year for $600m. That puts PUMA worth MORE THEN 600m. Since they already have 300m In sales . Add to the fact that Their existing lead drug already generating 1/4 Billion in annual sales, is just being rolled out globally NOW. At just 1X Annual sales (current existing sales plus 400m from the drug / todays test )Minimum a Billion in sales , so mot cap on PUMA will be 600m to $1BB . Takeovers for PUMA are coming after today’s test . Watch you will see very soon"
