Puma Biotechnology reached a 52 Week low at 5.97
Any news on 10% down?
Any insights on why they have negative net income? Is this common for pharma companies?

"I can't believe that there aren't any institutional investors that are not demanding the resignation of the CEO, who single-handedly destroyed his company's value by 97% over 7 years. Auerbach and his leadership team must go!"

Can you name one breast cancer drug company with at least 200m revenue a year is valued this low? I can not find one in this market. clvs and kpti are valued twice of it clec with 0 revenue and is valued more than it too.
This company generate a revenue above 250m and the market cap is around 250m. I don't get why not any big pharma is not interested in buying this at 2-3x revenue and just add the product to its portfolio. They already have infrastructure in place to sell and market a couple of additional products at no extra expenses.
New low everyday! Is this thing heading to bankruptcy?
"I'm just surprised institional holders are demanding answers....I think everyone is in bed with each other, pure manipulation, low float, and 250M in rev. Interesting how this was $7.75 AH after an upgrade by Citi, and then 1M shares started the drop to 6's"
$250m market cap with $200m revenue cancer drug
"Perhaps we should all write to Puma's Board of Directors, urging them to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to properly oversee the organization. The board members are: Allison Dorval (CFO at Voyager Therapeutics); Ann C. Miller (retired VP of Marketing at Sanofi; currently also a board member at Inovio Pharmaceuticals); Michael Miller (retired as EVP at Jazz Pharmaceuticals); Jay Moyes (CFO at Sera Prognostics); Adrian Senderowicz (senior advisor at Constellation Pharmaceuticals); Brian Stuglik (CEO of Verastem); and Troy Wilson (CEO at Kura Oncology). Of course, the inimitable CEO of Puma, Alan Auerbach is the chairman of the Board. I wonder how these individuals serve on a board of the organization that has consistently underperformed in such grotesque terms."
"Here is the email I sent to the so-called ""leadership team"" at Puma + the Board members I could find the email addresses for. Of course, no response, although that's to be expected. Dear Puma Biotechnology Leadership Team & Select Board Members,I am a holder of over 15k of Puma Biotechnology shares, whose value has plummeted in the past several years. As a senior finance executive with extensive Board experience, I am wondering how the obviously dismal financial performance and poor execution by Puma's leadership team in the past several years - and ongoing! - has impacted the Puma Biotechnology Board's oversight. Just to mention a couple of stats: - Puma Biotechnology's stock has collapsed from $260 per share 7 years ago to $6.24 per share as of today. This represents a 98% decline in value in 7 years.- Market cap has gone from over $400m only 9 months ago to about $250m now - an almost 40% deterioration in just 9 months! It is evident that the leadership team of Puma has failed in achieving its strategic and tactical goals as judged by the company's accelerating market value collapse. While I understand that this isn't the sole metric to gauge success, it is indeed a critical one for a publicly traded entity. My main question to the Board is: is there any governance in place that monitors and holds Puma's executive management accountable for the strategic and operational success of the organization? Have the following questions been asked by the Board: 1) is Puma's executive management up to the task of building and operating a financially thriving company, and if not, what correctional measures have been taken; 2) given the abysmal financial performance over so many years, has there been a consideration of seeking a buyer of Puma that would be able to re-build the organization; and 3) if Puma's strategy is to remain independent, have you considered going private."
Now it is time to buy
Puma Biotechnology is up 4.93% to 5.53
This looks like a good value play right now.... hopefully the earnings are good....
