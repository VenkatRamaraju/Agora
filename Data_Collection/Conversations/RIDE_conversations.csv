"New CEO. New CFO. Secured financial future with YA and strategic partnership with Foxconn (Apple) - $500m?? Backed by Ohio and gm because of jobs, carbon credit (at the very least). All this hype around -$146b in debt Ford…so weird?? I guess they’re planning on selling 14.6b F-150?? The evaluation of nikola, fisker and hylion. Huh???????"
Sam should be chiming in soon telling us he had a one and a half percent gain . today wash rinse repeat 
toomanytoms. kinda wierd fella(s)
Look at what’s happening with LUCID when actually sales start and that’s exactly what will happen with RIDE!
"Who bought today at 5.38 ?(Ha, ha, ha !)"
"Whoever is trying to mimic my name , You just committed a cardinal sin ️ Just today you lost 5% !! You are going to loose more May God bless you piece of peace , All the best longs!!!..."
Shame this should never go below $10
LMC is in the red every single day 
Sam you're so full of it nobody believes you 
I am really curious why this truck which is supposedly designed for the work market has a short bed.
"Look at MPLN, I only own 1500 shares, but they sold it down from $6.50 to $4.57 today in three weeks just because I bought some. They report in a few days."
Today the downsized Tiny Old FUDfactory was riding on LCID's coat tails which actually has EVs to deliver...
"""Longs"", you may target my messages to get them deleted, but this does not change the fact that RIDE is in free fall. Gagging someone you don't like does not solve your problem."
Do you think Steve Burns will sell half or all of his 26% in shares or he will be faithful to Ride?
Please go to $11 so I can get half my money back
"Let's line up all the EV companies with ZERO revenue: $NKLA $FSR $ARVL $LEV $FSR $RIDE $WKHS $GOEV6 of these companies have one more thing in common; their market cap is larger than $PTRA. $PTRA had $214M in revenue with a $2B market cap. Their revenue grew by %39 YoY, during global pandemic.Do the math."
How’s everyone doing? Are you all playing well together? My 1000 Lordsturds are still in the garage…
Admit it shorts .... SB has diamond hands and isn’t selling. And if he is who cares it’s green
Close 5 today? @I own puts@Tom@The best@the genius
ready for bankruptcy today
LCID continues dragging this do-nothing but make excuses stock higher again...
Could RIDE still be the first one to production? FoxConn has chip connections don’t they?
Aww fragile pumper Megan deleted their post 
"Bigger the bass, higher in $20"
"Lordstown's liquidity the EV startup had $210 to $240 million in available cash at the end of September.In connection with the Agreement in Principle described under Item 8.01 below, on September 30, 2021, Lordstown Motors Corp. (the “Company” or “Lordstown Motors”) and Foxconn (Far East) Limited, an affiliate of Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”), entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, and Foxconn agreed to purchase, 7,248,163 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for $6.8983 per share in cash, or approximately $50.0 million in total consideration. The closing is expected to occur as promptly as possible but no later than 10 business days after the date of the subscription agreement.$210 + 50 + 100+ $360M The Lordstown Complex consists of four main facilities in one location, in addition to multiple support buildings: (1) General Assembly, (2) a Body Shop, (3) Stamping and (4) a Paint Shop. The Lordstown Complex has approximately 6.2 million square feet of manufacturing space and significant production capacity that we believe will be more than sufficient to support its targeted ramp up over the next several years and provide ample capacity for further growth thereafter. We also have solar panels on-site, which generate approximately 2.2 megawatts of energy. The Lordstown Complex is in near-production-ready condition with modern robotics, painting, assembly and stamping equipment and weare in the process of making a significant retooling investment in order to commence full production of the Endurance.Construction is in process on an 800,000 square foot propulsion production area, which will house production lines for in-wheel motors and lithium-ion battery packs, and is expected in time for the targeted start of limited production of the Endurance in late September 2021. Which RIDE keeps along with....In November 2020, we opened a satellite research and development and engineering center in Farmington Hills, Michigan. This facility includes space for vehicle inspection and benchmarking, as well as labs for testing, validation and prototyping.In Irvine, California, we have established an engineering, technology and service center. We have established Lordstown EV Sales, LLC, to receive direct orders from customers and have received our dealership license from California."
"The Endurance towing capacity is ok at 8k lb. The seating is ok at five . The Three year warranty is well below industry standard. Three year bumper to bumper shows little confidence in the truck , the ten year battery warranty says they have more trust in the battery than the truck . Move the three to at least six year bumper to bumper and people may have more confidence in the truck."
"FWIW, Megan Burns (daughter of Steve) was ""Front Office Manager"" at Workhorse (maybe still is --- see Linkedin).Posted a LOT of stuff about WKHS and RIDE.Not sayin the Yahoo poster is the same ""Megan"", but the real Megan B was a regular on Stocktwits for awhile."
And you know why the call prices up there remained very high even though they are manipulating the shares....ASK ME LATER!!!
"We’ve been putting hub motors to the test. Watch the technology handle tall grass, gravel, and mud with the control and traction needed to get the job done. With four dedicated hub motors, the Endurance all-electric work truck can handle almost any terrain. #RideWithLordstown"
the genius. I know I know I'm sitting on a lot of shares though believe me I'm not happy about it 
Another +100 Nasdaq pts to pump us above $5
"TSLA $1,000 x 1 billion shares = $1 trillion market cap.TSLA expects to sell 885,000 EV in 2021 x $50,000 per EV = $45 billion salesTSLA selling for $1 trillion mc / $45 billion sales = 22x annual sales.With many more EVs coming from the traditional automakers, TSLA will be having much more competition, so will not see as much sales growth as the past 10 years..."
"In my opinion, Lordstown's relationship with Foxconn would be a shift to manufacturing as a service (MaaS) which is increasingly feasible and on-trend due to advancements that have been made in technology. The old traditional players in the industry have heavily depended on factories as a key component of their barriers to entry. Increasingly the factories of the big OEMs may become liabilities as it will be difficult for them to maneuver/shift production quickly and will probably have to spend significant amounts of time and money to retool factories that are bloated with union workers."
September production will change everything.
"Ford is going to crush these guys. Better product, lower price, nationwide support."
good old tom finally went to bed thank God. he'll be at it bright and early right around 8:00 
"“A magnesium shortage could trigger a shortage of aluminum, which in turn could also hitcar production”.10-20-2021 Zero HedgeWhat is da 6500lb Ford lectic pick up made of?The F-150 is mostly aluminum. The Lordstown Endurance at 4200 lbs except for the door panels is steel."

Lesson learnt is just keep adding when this goes below 5.
When truck?
Hi Megan!
"If Ford is having a tough time making the sale, imagine how hard it is for Lordstown.But some of those potential fleet buyers are taking a ""wait and see"" attitude, partly from a lack of experience with electric vehicles and partly from a lack of clarity on government policy and regulations around EVs."
Early thanks giving and all 'short' turkeys are cooked today
"@Ryan Already went out yesterday at 5.08 for a 6% gain. Waiting for another sub 5 dip toooo…..you guessed it, wash, rinse, repeat."
"What event will materialize first, a production truck rolling off the line or the elusive short squeeze?"
"Monday, 18 Octhttps://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/foxconn-foxtron-ev-brand-cars-electric-bus/"
Elon Musk acknowledged lordstown motor the $RIDE as one of good Ev trucks
well Sam looks like you left a lot of meat on the bone getting out at 5:08
I buying every dip  at this price
These fake accounts are being produced faster than the Endurances
"I’m wondering if Steve Burns us selling his￼ shares, or holding."
Some day the stock won't be recovering in price...
This CNBC Ford love affair…wow?!?!!!
Hoping to see the agreements ironed out and finalize within the next couple of days. ...so They can announce Nov's Q3 Report date in Oct.
Well it’s not easy for a start up like LMC . It’s a high risk but look how far this company has come . The next 90 days will break or make this company. Ask your self this ! Is it a real full size pick up truck or is it a mirage ? Did they roll the Truck off a hill like Nikola ? Does LMC has a team of experts from the auto industry? How many betas does LMC have ? How about the crash test 5/5/4 rating do you know what that means ? Why would the # 1 phone supplier in the world be interested in a scam ? I can keep going !
Are we getting details on Foxconn agreement after the close??? We were to get it by 31st which is Sunday.
"So, what's happening ?Let me guess: Steve Burns is buying shares . . . P.S. : Don't take me seriously."
Best time to get out now!
"Ford plans on being in the black, finally, by 2053"
"In the San Felipe 250, Lordstown got stranded due to lack of charging stations in the critical areas they needed. The truck only made it 40 miles on the course, which was grueling deep soft sand last year. Nevertheless, no issues with the hub motors, and the truck pulled through deep soft sand mixed with refrigerator sized boulders. Unfortunately they calculated 3X normal battery usage, and it proved to be 4X, and they got caught short. The truck made it to the road to get charged, tried going back, but they realized they’d get stuck in the mountains with no way to charge, and ultimately bailed. The truck actually drove about 100 miles that day. No issues with the hub motors."
Is now a good time to buy?
"You would think that since they missed the production target, management might take down all the news stories on the web site about on track for production in the fall."
"Back in at 4.88, wash, rinse aaaaaaaand repeat."
Wonder if someone's shares are being dumped?
"Finally, they announce Q3 Report on Nov.11th. Likely FoxConn agreement near ends today"
"NASDAQ up over +100 pts and not helping....ok, 2 o'clock PM claw back begins"
The crash testing certification is on the way …. Remember the endurance has a 5 star rating so far and the final inspection should be done soon with the amount of betas they have . To bad they have to crush these brand new trucks over and over at different angles but it’s for the security of the driver and passengers. Certificate soon 
"As we counted down the days until September production, now we're counting down to Foxconn / Hon Hai agreement. Should be a YUUUGE event."
"So I bought this at around $14 and change figuring, hey they have a factory and will be pumping out cars in a few months...what could go wrong?Hahaha, the joke was on me! Thank god I only bought 25 shares."
Just remember $RIDE is the next $TSLA 
"Headed back down under $5 again. Wash, rinse, repeat."
Hi Megan
"Lordstown CEO Daniel Ninivaggi said in an interview the new partnership with Foxconn allows Lordstown to move to a less capital intensive business model and that the deal is expected to close in about six months.""We can get the benefits of scale without necessarily having to do it all on our own,"" Ninivaggi said."
"TSLA at trillion and we are not even a billion, soon market will recognize. Yes TSLA delivered, we will too..in near future."
"Yehaaawwww, out at 5.08 for a nice 6% one day gain. 30% in 2 weeks"
"Only 5 days left to iron out the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. Talk about squeezing, Foxconn is doing just that to RIDE's nether regions right now. Want to know who is nervous? Lordstown executives are sweating bullets. Foxconn could walk and pick everything up later at the fire sale. Without the $230 million for the plant Lordstown has no hope of coming up with the $800 million detailed in the revised spending plan. Foxconn saw how the market destroyed this stock. They no they are in the driver's seat."
Not a bad day today and I believe RIDE is on an uptrend here. News is imminent in the next 3 weeks or so and possible hear something with the Foxconn deal on October 31st and the infrastructure bill should also help this stock. Shorts should be worried  now .
"10 endurance order for the City Parks . $568,000 is a start. Orders will be coming in soon we have a full plant of production for the next 5 years this is going to fly to $150.00"
Pro is racing to $4...
"Some seem to have blind folds on and ear plugs in tight. Got to realize a bad investment and move on, that's how the money is made. Arrogance looses money"
Atta boy!
"This stock will take off just like LUCID did today, up $11.08 so far today!"
Hopefully Tesla will buy ride
"Who brought their factory, who is building e-vehicles, Foxconn. It tells something…"
Time to load up again!
"I’ll buy back in today if dips below 5. BTW shorts, if you haven’t figured it out already what I’m doing is what the majority of buyers are doing and is why your shorts under 5 aren’t sticking."
just waiting for Sam to come on here and say he got in at 4.82 wash rinse and repeat.lmao.
I wonder if Burns will drop an Endurance at this peak
Also read that Lordstown has about 30% institutional ownership; that’s a pretty good sign in an otherwise dim outlook. I wish Lordstown would do better PR…
Sam is the only ding=a=long trying to dig out of his money pit with buying below $5 and selling the pops above $5...
Everyone is anticipating the next failure or bankruptcy from ride. This will go nowhere until they can prove it is a viable company. The odds are stacked against them.
"So far, not any major selling prior to end of month. No indication of Lordstown getting any bad terms to the FoxConn agreement"
Tip toed back in.
FoxConn agreement should close this week. SP should trade higher as this officially finalizes. Expecting to be back $6 before Friday...possibly $7ish
I hope it goes higher. Makes for a more profitable short opportunity.
"Subscription agreement for $50 Million should have closed.In connection with the Agreement in Principle described under Item 8.01 below, on September 30, 2021, Lordstown Motors Corp.

6 is on its way !!!...
I just read an article stating Steve Burns owns 26% of the shares. Anybody know when he’s able to cash them in?
"Foxconn agreed in principle, to purchase common shares at $6.89 from Lordstown. What's stopping them from slowly buying these shares at $4.96 and slowly taking a larger stake at a lower price?"
Pro was able to lasso up some dinner tonite...
"Lordstown...compared to Tesla.....anyone remember Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer, Saab?"
You know what this stock needs? Some good vibes
"Most recently, Kroll spent five months as chief administration officer for Hyzon Motors, the Menlo Park, California, company that is making hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles, according to his LinkedIn profile.Prior to that, Kroll spent four months as interim CFO for UPG Enterprises, the steel supplier in Oak Brook, Illinois.Earlier in his career, Kroll was an executive director at JP Morgan where he focused on the automotive industry, advising companies on more than $125 billion in capital markets, loan and mergers and acquisitions transactions, Lordstown Motors said.New cfo!"
"The Detroit News reports the company's battery line is ""fully commissioned"" and its assembly is production-ready. The company in its announcement said it expects to have liquidity between $225 million and $275 million in cash, excluding ""any funds from capital raises.""Foxconn would pay Lordstown Motors Corp. $230 million to purchase the massive 6.2 million-square-foot assembly complex it acquired from General Motors IF…LMC agrees to make Foxconn the contract manufacturer of its electric pickup truck."
Shorts can have their fun for now . Longs will be rewarded in 2022 once this is over $30.00 PPS. The Endurance first then the Van .
"The partnership between RIDE, FSR, and Foxconn hasn’t helped this sinking ship. At least Foxconn will keep the Endurance prototypes. Not the burned ones of course."
Hub motors are a game changer!! Yes they were... 130 years ago when they were first patented in 1880!! LMAO
"The stock is way above it's all-time low. To the moon. They have 100,000 orders and production started in September."
He bought at $5.25 today...
If day for EV tomorrow. Look for $7.50 prices
What happened to the pitch to AMZN? Amazon takes stake in Rivian.
By month end Foxconn deal will close......
The Ford model t had a single engine yup in 1915
"We have the team in play . New CEO and CFO with a team of engineers from Tesla, Ford, GM ….. and now (WKBN) — The company that has an agreement to buy the Lordstown Motors plant unveiled three new electric vehicle prototypes Monday.Foxconn showed off an electric bus, car and SUV"
"Nice! My shares are in the garage, growing up to become an Endurance"
"I know longs will be the winners...all the timeBut is today a short or a long's day, I mean close red or green? I go for green."
"Okay so the company has roughly 2 dollars a share in cash and will spend through it in a year or two and a dream. What are their options? They need billions. New share sale? Produce a few thousand EVs, but I don't think the timing of the cash flow will get the company to the finish line. Sell any other assets they have? What do they have? I think they sold what they have for a few hundred million to Foxconn."
"Looks like they are still negotiating with FoxConn. Once things finalizes, we'll see the SP affected in some way. ...or a specific Q3 Results date will be announced to provide updates."
We’re up after hours!
Lordstown Motors is up 10.40% to 5.30
