Time to back up the truck and fill er up.Going up.
Come on Wall Street beats this is the set up you were looking for.
"This seems to be a binary choice, either they make production or they don't. If they are successful producing the vehicles stock will go through the roof. If they are unable to meet production the stock will go to $0."
"After that alpha seek article, your gonna need more than shorts to bring this stock down. When you have low volume mixed with slow appreciation after a massive dip, all indicators suggest that the sellers are less and more confident and the buyers are more with slightly more confidence. A new ceo and we shall squeeze the shorts out of the water, it could happen any time now."
Price minimum 50$ before EOY
Stock is trying to turnaround...
"New CEO is from Icahn Enterprises, yes that’s Carl Icahn"
"Wow shorts, who would have thought? Up 20% in premarket on news. Ouch that’s going to leave a mark. Time to cover."
Now I can enjoy my weekend with a smile!
The risk is to lose 100% or to win 1000% ....... I bet on the 1000% and buy more shares
$10. for Tom.
Huge win. Congrats to all those who held strong during the pain. No pain No gain
Tom 6.66
Where is all the hype and detailed videos like the Ford Lightning? Bake Sales are run better than this epic disaster.
Shorts will buy this stock with $10 after 9.30am . New CEO the great. RIDE rocks today 
"All EV car manufacturers have had startup problems, many end up rising 1000%. The risk is to lose 100% or to win 1000% ....... I bet on the 1000% and buy more shares"
Looking for $5.75 to short more...
#RIDE is up with 17% and over 1.5M volume
this thing's going to run pretty good tomorrow also.
at 7.70 buying at this levels for a double dip in the sauce.
I own F and RIDE. Thank goodness RIDE came along and woke up F. It was stagnate until RIDE showed them the path!
BZ: Lordstown Motors Appoints Daniel A. Ninivaggi as Chief Executive Officer
RIDE has Carl Icahn backing. You know what that means.
Major airport purchase agreement announcement soon.
Be sure you're getting the real deal and not the...
Tom's short shorts must be pinching. His posts are about 20 minutes apart.

Who ever said making money was easy? we RIDE to 100.
"I understanding day traders taking some profit at 7, but we are going to 15.00"
$100/share coming
I expected more profit taking than this so far. Very positive indication.Although the short shorts seem to have come back on the board.
Chip shortages will probably temporarily hold up production for everybody in the EV market. Lordstown who have already prepaid their chips for the first year of production could potentially benefit here.
I will wake up to Ride premarket at $15 Monday
Money    on the way we will have party  soon next month 50$
"Shorts will be scrambling to cover as they find out that this hit ""Bottom"" last Thursday at $4.77 and reversing to an upward trend due to production, delivery, and new businesses."
Follow Pro make money.
TEN!
"6.15 is support boys and girls. ""When"" not ""if"" it hits 6.28. BUY BUY BUY!"
We have almost double the short interest AMC.
136.66 million shares has been traded today! The new well-known CEO has brought a lot a of good sentiment and restored investors faith in RIDE. The CEO has great track records and would never jeopardize his professional life and would not take this position if he did not believed in RIDE
Made a limit order to sell: $100/share expiring November. See you than.
Clear buy.
We are heading back into the teens quickly. Should hit 7.50 or higher today
Lordstown Motors is up 21.41% to 6.69
"The endurance is going to eat the lightning for breakfast. It’s a matter of specs, and the endurance has it all.Very very bullish on this company and after the alpha report, you should never allow any shorts telling you how bad this company is."
"Perhaps investors should focus on and ask management about DELIVERIES and DELIVERY DATES rather than production. There is no ambiguity about delivering a truck to a customer. Production can be pilot, trial, pre- etc."
"While you are swooning over the ""military"" model. Polaris already sells a conventional fuel vehicle, the Dagor A1. The war fighter will never use an EV that needs to be recharged. For mobility and air tranportation, weight is a big issue so battery packs are probably out too. Keep dreaming that demo was just a distraction. Importantly, it highlights management's lack of focus and is emblematic of a company searching for anything to keep the stock priced bouyed."
What Carl has to be thinking...
"Who bought at $7.79, please raise your hand."
The bashers gonna short their pants when trucks start rolling off the assembly line! It’s inevitable and I can’t wait.
"shorts are down 27 % on their positions, hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha"
"Another quick calculation for break even = $0 profits.Again with 20% gross profit margins on the $53,000 EnduringWait truck = $10,600 per truck and quarterly expenses of $110 million, it will take a quarterly production of $110,000,000 expenses / $10,600 per truck = 10,377 trucks per quarter to breakeven (= 41,508 annually)..."
Water please !!!
"Why fly with an established airline, when there is an upstart like RIDE ?"
Together we got it!
"I am concerned. FORD is soooooooooo much more experienced at handling recalls. and bad press. ""not safe at any speed"". Yet here they are!"
CARL==NEEDS TAX WRITE OFF?
we squeezing?
They were shorting more yesterday!!Total shares short as of 8-27-2021 ta da! Shares: 35.02 M
This morning will be the last time to get in under $8. Moon times
LETS GO
7 come to me.
"Yeah, cancelled the bid, I really don't need anymore RIDE. I own tens of thousands already. But will grab more if they try yesterday's lows. That way, I can take another $800 gain when they attempt their usual covering towards the end of the day."
"Mr. Ninivaggi will receive an annual salary of $750,000 and an annual bonus with an annual target bonus equal to 125% of his annual salaryNo wonder he took the job."
MEV. Looks perfect for interbase vehicle.
We can all feel it can we? the big short squeeze is coming. Every time they bring ride down it just won’t budge.
New CEO
Premarket jump. Hope this is a sign of something amazing
Shorts are underwater. Wait till the panic buying frenzy kicks in. $10 pre market. I wouldn’t be surprised. More news tomorrow.
Easily $25 within a year. Can't wait to be rolling in cash.
$15 by the end of this week! You think it’s impossible. Watch!
Cramer said he was wrong wow lol.
"Usually shorts are swarming upon weak stocks with poor sales/profit prospects. But ding-a-longs have figured out that if they swarm upon these heavily shorted stocks, they might be able to make a profit from getting shorts to cover the short positions. And these poor companies have figured out they can sell millions more shares to keep operating rather than ever make a profit..."
"If we are being truly honest with ourselves shorts, might be time to find another struggling company to pick on because RIDE didn’t go up 18% in one day for no reason."
"Ford Motor Co said Wednesday it will temporarily shutter its Kansas City assembly plant that builds its best-selling F-150 pickup truck due to a semiconductor-related part shortage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Do you think this bodes well for production of the Ford Lightning? I think not. Lordstown has procured the chips they need. If they barely have enough chips for their cash cow products, do you really think they will be making a lower margin fleet EV a priority?"
I don’t care about ever selling. I just want to be part of the movement that takes down Hindenburg short sellers that have been taking advantage of retail investors in many stock we all owned.
Only 7500 trucks a year. How are they going to stay in business?
Decided to cover yesterday's $5.75 short at $5.46 this morning for a quick 5% gain...
BOOM !!! THIS IS THE WAY !!!
"My average for 1400 shares is 5.70. If it falls below 5.00 I'm adding more. Between the former Tesla execs and now this new CEO from Icahn's company, RIDE has serious, experienced people joining them, and I don't think they would be doing that if this looked like a guaranteed failure. Quite the opposite."
Ding-a-longs looking tapped out...
"Mr. Ninivaggi is going to need to display very strong leadership, and an ability to gain investors. I wish him and all of the employees at Lordstown good luck and Godspeed. I’m not ready to get back in yet, but if this becomes a viable company, I’ll be interested in buying an Endurance."
"New PR posted this morning. Joining the LMC team after graduating with a degree in Chemical Engineering, Paint Process Engineer Kalliope works & collaborates alongside people who have decades of automotive experience with the goal of producing the best electric vehicle."
yeah sure you did Tom
"Wow, 1 month away from Burns being able to dump his 45M shares."
Yesterday 138 mln. Volume with a High oF 7.75 Today under 200 k volume Good opportunity toLoad up!Turning point in Ride’s history.Gl!
Wanna be bashers disappearing now? 
Just got back from having a Subway lunch and decided to cover at $6.48 for a nice 2.7% daily gain...
One would think with GM holding 7.5 Million shares they would not want to see them fail.
the truth is that they can announce some kind of a funding news anytime now. another story is if this will be something like printing more shares (means diluting) or something else..
"If Tesla shows even the slightest interest in this company and it's 6 million sf of production space, and proprietary technology, even a long look, would send this stock to 30-40 per share. Lot of Tesla alumni there already."
"Bought more yesterday, set a limit sell order at $100/share expiring November. See you than."
The big question is: Can the ding-a-longs get the share price to $6.66 today?
"Lynch said to invest into businesses that have strong fundamentals (check!), strong leadership (new, experienced ceo - Check!) and ideally, are undergoing some type of market panic (check!) - RIDE seems to check all boxes. Only problem for me is that Hertz also had Icahn, but still failed."
Everybody should write very very very positive things about RIDE. That will attract new investors and the price will go up. Then we can cut out and sell RIDE at a very nice premium and make good return.
Good week ahead for this American company who will be first to market with their all electric pick up!
Just set my sell orders for $100

"lordstown isn't even close to being on schedule. they were supposed to be in production last year. here's the original schedule for 2020...""According to Burns, the company will show the pickup in Detroit this June, begin crash testing it in July and then start hiring workers to build the vehicles in September. Production will start in November or December of this year.""https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-detroit-auto-show/"
Apes decided to sleep in today...
How are pickups used at the airport?
Congrats RIDE for getting an experienced responsible CEO. Unfortunately he will begin to deliver the truth as he should and it's not going to be pretty.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-r-jmK5w28 ....... WE WILL SOON SEE as SEPTEMBER NEARS..??
News coming before Friday.
"I have been going through some crypto resources particularly on Ethereum, bitcoin I wish to start contributing on these crypto resources would anyone be able to kindly tell me which is ideal to put resources into and furthermore what the overall revenue resembles?"
"September is a day away, don't miss out on the train."
Seeking Alpha hits it out of the park!
anyone know anyone who works for LTM? What are they doing all day? Supposedly have 400 employees and have not started mass production.... so what are they doing?
Why pop 4%? ...gotta be some.news?
Ninivaggi is now the 2nd largest insider shareholder after Steve Burns.He's in it to win it.
Buy now for an easy %50 gain.
"Ford Motor is once again cutting production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup truck and two other vehicles next week due to the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.The automaker on Thursday confirmed its Oakville Assembly Plant in Canada and Kansas City Assembly Plant in Missouri will be down the week of Aug. 30. Oakville builds the Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus crossovers. Kansas City assembles the F-150.Ford also will cut two of three shifts next week at its Dearborn Truck Plant in Michigan, which produces the F-150.Which begs the question- if Ford doesn't have enough chips for their cash cow ICE F-150s, it certainly could significantly impair their ability to produce the Lightning which contains more chips."
RIDE will skyrocket any moment. $10-$15 ...easy!
"Actually, since they like playing around $6.20, I moved the bid to $6.23 and tripled that number. That way, they still get three cents more...lol. So I expect them to come to $6.28 now"
I’m buying in ore market. This is gonna be $15 by weeks end
"I asked a question this morning that still has not been answered: Why have several execs with Tesla credentials, who could work anywhere in the EV industry, chosen to work with RIDE?"
"I have been going through some crypto assets especially on Ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple because I wish to begin investing on these crypto assets can anyone please let me know which is best to invest in and also what the profit margin looks like?"
Connections with Carl Icahn. He could throw some lunch money at us and we would have all we would ever need to get into production.
Up again!
This is going to be green everyday until end of September. No one is selling because no one wants to miss this opportunity.
Rivan wadding through a shallow watery canal at low speed on Twitter . I saw the video looks like low powered pick up compared to endurance.
I think I can....I think I can....The little engine that could.
Selling for anything over $15 will be a regret. If new egg can jump 500% in a day with the same short interest same float we can get to $50 easy!
$ZOM will never stop
Longs should be happy If Ride increases the number of shares the loss per share will be smaller (gotta love longs arithmetic.
"With a $53,000 EnduringWait truck selling price and an industry high 20% gross profit margins (GM and F only have 15% profit margins since they don't know anything about making vehicles other than 13 million annually) equals $10,600 profits per truck.With 177 million shares x $6.50 per share = $1,151 million marketcap.Assuming $0 for all other expenses like R&D, SG&A, WKHS 1% + 4% commissions, income taxes, etc., $1,151,000,000 / $10,600 = 108,585 trucks need to be sold to recoup the marketcap investment.With an annual production rate of 7,500, it would take 108,585 / 7,500 = 14 years 6 months."
So the big question on everybody's mind is will the EnduringWait truck be able to complete 50 miles in the Baja 2022 race?
I’m Starting a Small Position in $RIDE as soon as the Pre-Market gets underway because the Starting of Production is Going to make this Stock Explode ! Get in before the bull run gets underway !

"tesla looked at hub motors, rivian looked at hub motors, both are well funded and rely on experienced engineers and...both rejected the idea. there is no way in this world that little lordstown can develop the AI necessary to get four hub motors synchronized. that is why only company trained drivers have been allowed behind the wheel..."
"Be very careful, this stock will skyrocket any moment."
Just got email from lordstown about their real people real work real truck and other stuff..great confidence in them
I got an email from Lordstown this morning. Updates on pre-order delivery dates coming soon!
Back to $30s folks.
Nice to see that the shorts can't see 2 inches in front of them. Next comes funding and it's game over. Hang tough bears and don't cover! Would prefer a squeeze over $25.
Push for a squeeze!!! I need a house deposit!!!

Got 1000 more
I will ask again. Can anyone point to evidence that they have managed to get this truck to drive over 40 mph consistently? From my research I have yet to find any evidence of such. It is known though that they are having issues syncing the 4 hub motors as it was disclosed during Lordstown week as the reason they couldn't go over 40 mph.

I just traveled through La Guardia airport in New York City I only saw 6 pickup trucks at two of the four terminals I could see. I don't think there is big demand for pickup trucks at airports. Which airport is going to place an order for more than 20?

"Sold twice and left.Nothing is left in RIDE. Too many companies with real factories ,assembly sites, and actual products rather than fake drawings and pictures."
Now RIDE is pushing to sell military 6-seaters rather than build to sell pickups...
Shorties feel like
short sellers are trying hard to keep it down. dont sell for low. buy and hold.
What's happening guys. Buy the shares before it goes up.Soon will fly to the moon!!
Covered at $6.66...
The new CEO with great reputation and excellent track record as an CEO of different companies only means that RIDE is legit and working hard to bring its product to the market. No great CEO in their right mind would accept leading a fraud business and he is now appointed as the CEO it means they are on the right track . This new CEO means restored faith in RIDE and its production among all investors.
hold longs it's about to bank
I love this stockLong
Maybe going to see 10$ next 6 months.
"CEO appointment Daniel Ninnivegi great news, saw his background with auto industry and Carl Ichan connection. Great news for RIDE."
hold!
RIDE moving up on the squeeze list... get ready.
"Please Carl, RIDE needs your $400 million..."
"buying at open, FOMO"
"You all have to consider the fact that this company is NOT going to mass produce EV's...EVER. They can fill a niche at airports and short run small trucking companies. Think about this...years ago a company called Butler Aviation was in every airport in the country. They took baggage to and from planes and delivered some fuel. That company prospered for years. Now in the future, this can be done and airport operators would prefer it to be done by EV's. And Lordstown is ahead of Ford and GM. Just my opinion."
Could be a interesting week 
So LM got a good CEO in less than 3 months . This tell me they were looking for another CEO since Burns left . This is a major catalyst for LM . As the CEO stated that it’s imperative that production starts on time as he said he will get lots of friends ( meaning loans will be lining up ) hopefully non- diluted.
"Wow! So much excitement in this room! Either fans with strong convictions, or people posting funny pictures trying to make fun of investors."
Production of first EV pickup on track for September per the company. Load the Endurance up!
Because this will go back up over $20 and you know it will. Anyone bashing this knows this and they are just wanting to mess with you into selling so they can make money. Remember everyone is out for themselves. People don’t just help because they want to see you do good. People are out for themselves
"What is “substantial doubt”?In summary, FASB ASC 205-40 provides the following new guidance as a result of the issuance of ASU No. 2014-15:a. Defines the term substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern (substantial doubt) as follows:Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The term probable is used consistently with its use in Topic 450 on contingencies.b. Requires an evaluation every reporting period, including in- terim periodsc. Provides that the mitigating effect of management's plans should be considered only to the extent it is probable the plans will be effectively implemented and mitigate the conditions or events giving rise to substantial doubtd. Requires certain disclosures when substantial doubt is allevi- ated as a result of consideration of management's planse. Requires an explicit statement in the footnotes that there is substantial doubt and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviatedf. Requires an evaluation for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued)"

The almost daily occurrence of negative articles on Lordstown Motors (RIDE) is strange considering those articles all state a similar thesis - that LMC cannot compete.To some, this seemingly directed smear campaign against LMC might seem familiar to the one against a fledgling Tesla nearly a decade ago. The similarities exist because a source that has spoken to C-suite LMC management has told me that those executives concluded that it is the same entity leading the attack on Lordstown, the National Automobile Dealers Association."
I’m all in won’t sell till $50
Show zero mercy let’s see the squeeze
"The Lordstown All star Team, Lets get this stock back to the 30's"
Shorts are nervous.
Just keep buying keep pressure on let’s moon this thing. Don’t forget 38% short interest will take all day for them to cover $20
"“When Lordstown Motors first came out, I said ‘Wow, that’s impressive,’” Daniel Ninivaggi, told The Business Journal in an interview Aug. 26. “I like the hub motor design, they’re going into the right part of the market with the right product, and they’ve got the benefit of the Lordstown plant.”"
Carl Icahn is my one of most favorite legendary investors. His CEO joining RIDE means a lot. For sure I can say that RIDE is not NKLA. Its a real company and stock will go back to 38 in future.
have a lot of them but couldn't resist and added few hundred this morning.
I bet an article comes out talking about production vs pre production....just what we need. More confusion to cause panic.
Premarket is going to be great tomorrow
I just bought today 177 million shares !
Board appoints new CEO Daniel Ninivaggi.
Don't get taken again people. I mentioned it yesterday. DON'T invest in this stock! TRADE IT!
Don’t drive your brand new 2021 Ford F 150....you’ve been ordered to park it and TOW it in to get the seatbelts replaced.
I don't get the spike...what fundamentally changed?
Today is the day we bankrupt Hindenburg. They have been taking advantage of us retail investors. Don’t let them off easily by selling at $10 it can goto $20
Just took out the average daily volume in 2 minutes. What to do with the rest of the day?
Did you see that pop on $RIDE? One news and 25% move upside:) Shorts must be very careful.
"Ford’s F-150 was hit by the global semiconductor shortage, and now its flagship Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle is seeing a serious delay too — by a minimum of six weeks for prospective owners who were scheduled to get their vehicle between July 5th and October 1st. Imagine how far this could push out the Ford Lightning."
The big Reno gamble is going to be Carl or bust...
Shorts you said this was going to fall? What happened? Oh that’s right you were wrong 
CEO......an announcement of a major purchase order.....and a plan with confirmed financial backing to fulfill that initial order. Thats what needs to happen this week.
Thanks for 6.21 
Who bought today? I did. $7.29 avg now.
"While I am away at lunch, please let me know when my $6.66 short is losing money because I would hate to lose money like the ding-a-longs..."
Today was a beautiful ride. Let’s continue fellow long investors.
AMC will squeeze this weeks bringing all meme stocks to new levels! $20
"Yeah, I'm just going to give up my job as CEO of a highly profitable conglomerate and step into a startup so I can get that 750k annual salary. Yeah. Seems to me we are seeing a plan unfold and the plan is to make trucks in Lordstown. If it is Icahn, he certainly has the $$$."
"Anyone add more this morning? I did. 160 more to round off my total. 3K avg $7.24. Such a Ding A Long am I. If this goes to zero, I'm changing my address to 2300 Hallock Young Rd, Warren, OH 44481. Come visit, I'll show you around. Bring the whole family! I'll make a giant mile long shuffleboard table and play with leftover hubs!"
"Come on and invest Carl, think of all the bar mitzvahs you and your friends can have at the Big Old Factory..."
Should be TRENDING but yahoo won’t allow it.
Go back $12.
"Lordstown will make history with the first electric truck running on four motor hubs!!!Be part of the change, and make money."
"Ford recalls 2021 F-150 trucks due to bad seatbelt. Last month 800,000 recalled FixOrRepairDailyhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/ford-recall-suv-pickup-truck.amp"

Give us an early Gift
Hindenburg getting margined called first on AMC then ride then bankrupt.
"When do the margin calls start, 9h30?"
Wow AMC already squeezing. I’m here to take Hindenburg money.
Short squeeze coming?
"Gotta get thru this upcoming week by staying above $5. Next week should be better! ""Lordstown Motors heads to the NAFA Institute & Expo in Pittsburgh, PA from August 30 - September 1 to get the Endurance in front of a largely new audience. The NAFA I&E is billed as “the premier professional development and networking event that brings together fleet professionals from across North America in every segment including corporate, government, public safety, utility, education and more.” NAFA is the world’s premier not-for-profit association for professionals who manage fleets of sedans, law enforcement vehicles, trucks, buses, as well as a wide range of military and off-road equipment for organizations."""
"Prideev is launched, and they have the endurance posted along with lion electric and workhorse. I know the location of this company as I live near them, they have a massive property for logistics. Search it on google, yahoo doesn’t allow me to post the website."
Here we gooooo....
"Quick comparison calculation to Ford:F market cap = 4 billion shares x $13 = $52 billionF price to sales = $52 billion mc / $136 billion sales = 0.38RIDE market cap = 177 million shares x $5 = $885 millionRIDE would need sales = $885 million / 0.38 = $2.3 billionWith a $53,000 price per truck, RIDE would need to sell $2.3 billion / $53,000 = 43,400 trucks per year.Adding the often-quoted $148 billion total F debt to the $52 billion F mc = $200 billion total mc + debtF total price to sales = $200 billion / $136 billion sales = 1.47 total price to salesWith $0 debt, RIDE would need sales = $885 million / 1.47 = $602 millionWith a $53,000 price per truck, RIDE would need to sell $602 million / $53,000 = 11,400 trucks per year."
why selling! still more big news ahead lol
SAY GOODBY TO 5.00 !!!
Water Please ....
$10 soon
3 solid green days in a row !!!!!
"When the Carl news is announced, there will be a big buying pop before a big selling drop. Whoever gets stuck holding in the end will suffer from ever more share dilution..."
The ding-a-longs are waving flags to honor Carl and his $400 million...
HOLD
PRODUCTION BEGINS SEPTEMBER 2021
A new CEO is supposed to magically make this turn around?
Can you imagine the look on hedgie's face when the trucks start rolling off the line? LOL
"Question: Can a squeeze start intraday or does it happen overnight via reddit and wsb, moving it to meme stock status?"
Hahahahahah shorts
Green
question really is not so much about management but whether anyone at lordstown can figure out how to get those four hub motors synchronized so the Endurance is not only safe to drive on paved roads but also driveable by someone who hasn't been trained to get used to its handling...
buy at open or wait?
"Wanna buy my shares, the least I take is $100/share."
"Still no money,still no product,still no buyers"
High quality CEO in place with automotive experience and top end financial connections. 1st step is complete. Next is partial funding with price melt up ensuing. Then the real $$$ come in at much higher pricing.
Pro was right again. Buy now!
Did you buy more today? Willi?
"LOL...now you see why I was trying to get out of those long-dated $10 and $12 calls. RIDE will be $50 by Jan 2023. And if Carl Icahan starts buying early, as I suppose he will....not with 32 percent shorted shares on a company with asset valued more than MKT CAP, we may see that $50 very very soon!"
I doubled my shares and got this notification: Your account currently holds securities that may qualify for the SLFP program. no thanks
"Carl knows that since RIDE will keep needing more cash until production is over 41,508 annually and is likely years away, the only deal to make is to get a few 100 million free stock options that can be immediately cashed-in and sold on the big price pop for a quick profit to recoup the $400 million in share investment. Of course, the company will get even more much-needed cash when those stock options are exercised = win-win..."
This has been on the Top 10 squeezes list for months now. Could easily see $11-12 today from covering alone.
Love this company. Big money to be made.
Someone check on Tom!!!!!
It’s gonna spike to $10 on open. Lol.
Today is gonna be big after that redit post at the trade show.
Down one penny.I'm sure it was due to Tom's 47 posts today.
Cramer was wrong again what a tool.
