Ford has installed about 1 BILLION SEATBELTS and STILL has to recall the 2021 F-150 since they haven’t figured it out yet.
Only 7500 trucks a year. How are they going to stay in business?
I just got 4000 more shares!

"Ford recalls 2021 F-150 trucks due to bad seatbelt. Last month 800,000 recalled FixOrRepairDailyhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/ford-recall-suv-pickup-truck.amp"
"With a $53,000 EnduringWait truck selling price and an industry high 20% gross profit margins (GM and F only have 15% profit margins since they don't know anything about making vehicles other than 13 million annually) equals $10,600 profits per truck.With 177 million shares x $6.50 per share = $1,151 million marketcap.Assuming $0 for all other expenses like R&D, SG&A, WKHS 1% + 4% commissions, income taxes, etc., $1,151,000,000 / $10,600 = 108,585 trucks need to be sold to recoup the marketcap investment.With an annual production rate of 7,500, it would take 108,585 / 7,500 = 14 years 6 months."
"I am concerned. FORD is soooooooooo much more experienced at handling recalls. and bad press. ""not safe at any speed"". Yet here they are!"
"“When Lordstown Motors first came out, I said ‘Wow, that’s impressive,’” Daniel Ninivaggi, told The Business Journal in an interview Aug. 26. “I like the hub motor design, they’re going into the right part of the market with the right product, and they’ve got the benefit of the Lordstown plant.”"
Production of first EV pickup on track for September per the company. Load the Endurance up!

Wow this is top ten on the squeeze meter for fidelity.
"tesla looked at hub motors, rivian looked at hub motors, both are well funded and rely on experienced engineers and...both rejected the idea. there is no way in this world that little lordstown can develop the AI necessary to get four hub motors synchronized. that is why only company trained drivers have been allowed behind the wheel..."
I bet an article comes out talking about production vs pre production....just what we need. More confusion to cause panic.
Wedding receptions for the empty Big Old Factory space? There's some big money there...
"Hey, where has all the money been going?"
I love this stockLong
still no word on Federal braking tests. getting those hub motors sychronized for stopping is much more difficult than setting them up for accelerating...
A new CEO is supposed to magically make this turn around?
"This seems to be a binary choice, either they make production or they don't. If they are successful producing the vehicles stock will go through the roof. If they are unable to meet production the stock will go to $0."
CEO......an announcement of a major purchase order.....and a plan with confirmed financial backing to fulfill that initial order. Thats what needs to happen this week.
