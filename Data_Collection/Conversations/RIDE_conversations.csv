"the potential is significantly out weighing the risks: The Hub motor works and efficient to production feasibility in both cost and speed. The former CEO fully entrusted in the technology and his shares have been locked until October (which was presumed to be 1 month after the production scale up in September but Ride encountered Covid and surging in price for parts/semiconductor shortage). Foxxcon is a contracted builder for Apple iphones and Fisker Auto, this new Lorstown factory could potentially set up Apple EV car production where Ride could become Apple's partner is this Hub Motor skateboard is as good as Ride has been touting. Imagine Apple software enhancing the performance of Ride Hub motor skateboard, easily transforming from a pickup truck to SUV and Van, even a monstrous powerful EV car. The reward is the sky and the risk is $5/sh. Hold and buy more on dips."
Well at least its not at the daily low.... oh wait it IS at the daily low..
"Subscription agreement for $50 Million should have closed.In connection with the Agreement in Principle described under Item 8.01 below, on September 30, 2021, Lordstown Motors Corp. (the “Company” or “Lordstown Motors”) and Foxconn (Far East) Limited, an affiliate of Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”), entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, and Foxconn agreed to purchase, 7,248,163 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for $6.8983 per share in cash, or approximately $50.0 million in total consideration. The closing is expected to occur as promptly as possible but no later than 10 business days after the date of the subscription agreement."

"Kroll’s “deep understanding of the automotive industry and experience in financial operations and strategy will have an immediate impact” in bringing the Endurance to market and completing the company’s partnership with Foxconn, Ninivaggi said in a release Wednesday announcing the new CFO."
Arrtg! I’m a bag holder! I’m going to take a nap. Good thing I played this pretty well yesterday!
Nice to see a new CFO on board. This will give more transparency going forward .
The Endurance really looks like one of the most exciting vehicles to come to the market in a long time... Skate Board Design and Hub Motors... Lowest Cost of Ownership... It Will Revolutionize The Auto Industry...!
"When all the cash is spent (management is not going to admit failure and decide to liquidate thereby returning cash to shareholders), what is left? All RIDE has is a hub motor assembly line that uses technology licensed from an Eastern European company that is set up in a leased factory, a battery pack assembly line in the same leased factory, and a pick up truck design licensed from an obscure EV company. How much do you really think that is worth? They will have to pay someone to scrap everything when Foxconn evicts the company for non-payment."
"Hyzon, where our new CFO came from, has similar and possibly worse problems. perhaps he was actually resigning from Hyzon just as our CFO was forced to do? if so, he's just jumping from one sinking ship to another...""Lordstown still faces a lot of scrutiny from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to its merger with a SPAC, and statements it previously made about pre-orders for its vehicles."""

Steve Burns trying to figure out which beach to retire to once he dumps all of his shares in 11 days
lordstown says expenses are going up even after selling the plant. so all the cash on the books and all the money coming in will be used up within 12 months and that means the 'going concern statement' remains along with the risk of bankruptcy. keep in mind they have been overstating cash because the updated 10-k filing said they were in arrears to suppliers because they had not been making minimum payments. it all said they they did not have adequate staff that knew how to keep the books...

I see lots of good things happening to Lordstown Motors next year and after that so I plan to buy over $9000 worth of shares while the price is still low and hold it till I can make a big profit from it.
"Foxconn deal happened and, it’s this bad just imagine if it didn’t?? Hired shills in the media are a joke especially that Morgan Stanley dude. The SEC should probe his as…"
shorts aren't driving the price down. it's longs throwing in the towel and selling. short interest is down 20% in the last two months. there is virtually no potential for a short squeeze while margin calls keep piling up for the clueless pompom pumpers...
"hey invester big big risk now will crash below $1 , no deal offically signed yet. still lot lot of neigotion have to happen , foxconn can still back out if they dont like theneogotion . probably willwill backout"
So strong
"So the downsized Tiny Old FUDfactory will have $240 million current cash + $50 million FoxyCon share sale + $230 million Big Old FUDfactory sale = $520 million cash / (176.6 million shares + 3.6 million YA shares + 7.2 million FoxyCon shares ) = $520 million / 187.4 million shares = $2.77 per share cash value...Cash balance on September 30, 2021 - $210 to $240 million, down from $225 to $275 million, which includes approximately $20 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Company’s Equity Purchase Agreement in August and September but excludes proceeds from Foxconn’s purchase of $50 million of the Company’s common stock as announced today.the Company agreed to issue and sell, and Foxconn agreed to purchase, 7,248,163 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for $6.8983 per share in cash, or approximately $50.0 million in total consideration."
Tomorrow shorts will be like
"Highlights of the tentative deal/partnership with Foxconn:Foxconn pays RIDE $230 in cash for the factory excluding some assets *.* Assets retained by RIDE: Hub Motor assembly line, Battery module and packing line and certain intellectual property rights along with other assets not listed.Lordstown will sub-lease their part of the factory and retain core employees (except production workers).Foxconn also agrees to purchase $50 million in Lordstown stock, at a price of $6.8983 a share. Foxconn will acquire 1.7 million warrants (exercise price of $10.50/exercise in 3 years).Foxconn will manufacture the Endurance and provide rights to future vehicle programs.Foxconn will offer employment to Lordstown operational and manufacturing employees."
"foxconn could care less about the Endurance. it bought the plant to build this vehicle for Fisker as confirmed by this statement...""Ironically, Fisker, which is building electric SUVs in partnership with Foxconn, revealed it will build its sub-$30,000 SUV Pear at Lordstown's Ohio facility and now expects an earlier launch."""
I know it'll pain all of you to admit it... But I said at beginning of week this would be just under $5 by end of week and BTW that was while it was up 10% during premarket...
Hiring more and more upper echelon to line pockets and not make a vehicle. Just burning cash and warming up the climate.
It’s amazing this company is still in business.
Let's see $4 today!
"RIDE this roller-coaster! I'm in for a bang or bust. This will either offset capital gains or eventually become a profit. I have waited these kind of stocks out before and if they pay off, they pay very well."
"Are Ford and GM bondholders feeling nice and cozy or worried with all these new EV coming online, with little of no debt? Hmmm"
"Selling the plant (their only asset) does not stop the bleeding, it’s not even a bandaid to slow the bleeding, it’s just a bucket to catch the bleeding so the executives can feed from the bucket until it’s empty without any revenue at all until a year from now they are bleeding lordstown dry. The board if there is one should fire or lay off everyone until production starts especially high wage earners"

so awful to look at. Drop near 50% in less than a week.

Nice to see it above $5…again. I expect more volatility but more on the upside than downside.

Wow.. I didn't see this coming..
Woot.
pro was right the whole time.
"I still feel they should target business sales. A few weeks ago they were the only truck represented at a show for airports. LMC could corner that and never have to compete with GM, Ford, and the Japanese and Europeans. Each of those Co's. are having their own problems with batteries and such. Business and commercial sales would give LMC a virtual monopoly."

"Well, at least it's not down 10% already. LOL!!!"
So did foxconn. buy ride or just the factory to make or lease out to other car or truck companies....
"lordstown still has to maintain the line, the tooling, and keep everything updated...""the Contract Manufacturing Agreement will provide that: (1) LEVC shall be responsible for sourcing directed supply and supplier tooling for the Endurance, replacement tooling on those components and LEVC requested engineering changes or re-sourcings"""
I will keep on buying and be patient 
"Sale of the factory is an admission of failure. Basically, the new CEO just sold all the recently purchased equipment that was installed at the plant and gave the plant to Foxconn. The $50 million share purchase just dilutes current shareholders. The contract manufacturing terms will be so favorable to Foxconn that either there will be no profit for RIDE or no trucks will ever be built. RIDE will have to pay to reprogram the line every time there is a production run. The risk profile of RIDE also changes because to make it economical they will have to big production run of trucks before they are sold."
https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/valley-congressman-tim-ryan-meets-with-lordstown-motors-ceo/
"Problem here is Ride has nothing left to sell. Their only asset is sold to generate enough cash to barely survive one year. They have not produced a single vehicle in the two years after they acquired the fully tooled GM Lordstown plant. Their technology although ingenious does not belong to them it belongs to Workhorse who they promised 10% from every truck sold. The new landlord stated the plant will not be ready to produce a production vehicle for at least a year. No cask flow coming in, bleeding daily, no assets left, no proprietary technology to sell or leverage, Morgan Stanley downgraded to $2 or was it $1…….without cash flow soon they are done."

"lordstown has no patents on hub motors or batteries, and has no sold their only asset, the big old plant, at a loss after all the tooling that went into it. and now they want to become an EV designer. only problem is they have never designed anything. the Endurance which they gave up trying to produce they got from Workhorse who had previously given up on trying to produce it. there is no future for lordstown..."
"Ford has a better truck coming out sooner. Brand support, lower price point. RIDE missed their moment."
"And I did another 250 shares at $5.22, time: 09:39:34 EDT."
Down another 10% in PM...may just go below $5 today. Foxconn should have bought out RIDE...the entire factory and whole company for $10/share....or might just do...like before April production at a lower price of $5/share?
"Ok, who saw this coming?"
"Another passage from the book, developed this morning:""Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas was a great example and captures the flawed influence of cognitively-biased analysts on RIDE. Adam Jonas had established a $25 price target on RIDE after the initial listing. With Hildenburg and the stock sell-off, Jonas initially arbitrarily reduced his RIDE price target to $8, rating the stock Underweight. He later reduced the price target to $1. In the first week of June, 2021 and while RIDE was trading around $10, Jonas abruptly pulled his underweight ratings stating in part, that Morgan Stanley believed that the market was underestimating Lordstown’s economic, strategic, political and social risks. According to Jonas, Morgan Stanley thought that those risks were too difficult to quantify. Analyst Adam Jonas then moved Morgan Stanley to the sidelines on RIDE rating. Throughout the summer of 2021, there was a seesaw on RIDE shares, with some analysts seeing the stock at $1, while at least one analyst established $20 as price target. Inexplicably, at the end of September 2021, Adam Jonas slid Morgan Stanley back into RIDE analysis with an Equal Weight rating and reestablished his $8 price target. The price target and Jonas’ entire analysis would last only three days. Lordstown announced the deal discussed above and Adam Jonas re-anchored his thesis to a bearish outcome. Analyst Jonas claimed that he had assumed that the Lordstown plant was worth over a billion dollars. Now that the plant was sold, according to him for less than 20 percent of his assumption, he was slashing his price target to $2. The bad news was that neither the company nor any other analyst on the stock had this assumption. In its second quarter statements, Lordstown had reported the value of all its assets in an SEC filing to be $286.3 million. In fact, RBD Capital analyst - Joseph Spak, another bearish analyst on RIDE, was so excited about the Lordstown-Foxconn deal that he raised his price target on RIDE from $1 to $5. More importantly, for an analyst that essentially was not following RIDE for three months, analyst Jonas did not assume a billion dollars of plant assets prior to quitting RIDE in June 2021. So, one was left to question whether analyst Jonas fixed his benchmarks arbitrarily in order to get to his assumed price target or whether he actually looked at the stocks he followed. More importantly, was analyst Jonas working for someone else - some short-seller that had driven RIDE down from an $8.80 high and now needed an $8 price target taken off in order to try and cover at $5 – five dollars being here the big banks settled their price targets? Do you feel me?"""
"no production until at least late 2023 but more likely 2024 since there are always delays. foxconn's statement...""Existing automobile manufacturing facilities, infrastructure, employees, and location in Ohio with robust supply chain resources will give Foxconn speed to market that meets our customer's needs for production by end of 2023."""

Worth nibbling at 5Good luck traders and longs
Hey management.. thanks for mentioning to your investors that NO trucks would be produced when promised until AFTER the dead line. What a failure on so many levels.
RIDE longs watching and hoping for a victory by only having a-2% day...
"RIDE is hiring! Both, OH factory and office and CA office! Lot of positions are open! Go to website and see! Don’t listen to anyone in “blogs” and “comments”! Nobody knows nothing but to speculate!"
"Wait...is it possible NO ONE is buying this truck, and the former CEO lied about customer interest to take this company public then cashed in for his own benefit?"
"Interesting points According to Mahoning Matters reporter Justin Dennis:-Will the vehicles have a Foxconn or a Lordstown Motors badge once they are available to the public?“I think it's still a little too early to tell,” Dennis said.-One appealing aspect of the deal for Foxconn is the access to Lordstown Motors’ hub technology, Dennis said. “They believe in the hub motor design, which is commercially untested at this point,” he said.“Really the only moving parts essentially are the four wheels, and everything is fed off a battery pack so there's no drivetrain,” Dennis said.In my opinion, if what Dennis is saying is true about Foxconn believing in the hub motor design and Lordstown is holding onto the hub motor line for themselves - then I think the market is under appreciating the value of that - not to mention the value of the battery line."
"I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THE FOXCONN DEAL AND ACTUALLY LIKE THE DEAL !!! LORDSTOWN MOTORS RETAINS SKATEBOARD HUB MOTOR DESIGN !!! FOXCONN HAS THEIR OWN SEMI CHIP FACTORY AND CIRCUMVENT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES UNLIKE GM, FORD AND MANY OTHERS !!! ADDITIONALLY FOXCONN IS HEAVY INTO CLOUD COMPUTING, AI AND SELF DRIVING AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS !!! FOXCONN BRINGS ALOT TO THE TABLE AND AS A LONG TERM SHAREHOLDER I HOPE THE DEAL GOES THROUGH !!!"
I’m out…Will use this stock as my 3K loss write off for the year. Finally some peace instead of being annoyed every single day as bag holder.
"I sold at 9.20 Thursday. My first ""TOP"" sale in 40 years of trading. Now I can get a 32% discount. Of course it was only for 250 shares."
Can anyone name two Lordstown customers?
On the other spectrum.. imagine how happy those are that sold on Thursday above $8
"I love the business model, GM and Foxconn in am in too."

Let’s go LMC!
"Now that we have two extra decimal points on the big board, the longs can gloat when they are up a couple hundredths of a penny, instead of bragging about whole pennies."
"Another good comment: …. “ The deal gives the Taiwanese conglomerate its first automotive factory, and a significant new presence in the United States — one that the company will use as it tries to establish itself as a global electric vehicle automaker. Foxconn previously announced a massive LCD panel factory in Wisconsin but has failed to live up to the myriad promises it made to that state.“"
"ought a few twice already, and with each buying, they stalk the purchase and lower the stock a penny: 250 shares at $5.26 by 09:35:28EDT, they lowered and I got another 200 at 09:36:11EDT. Just to track, nothing else."
Where is the new Ceo hiding and the BOD they just don’t give a Damm about the shareholders only there golden parachute I hope they fall
"This is the most important part I got from the deal: No going concern issues going forward, because now Foxconn has to pay the maintenance and bills for that huge building. Lordstown can just focus on their product, and scale up as their cash allows, and pause when they're out of cash. One more thing: It's in Foxcon's interest to ramp up as quick as possible for Lordstown and begin cranking out vehicles, even if it requires them more capital expenditures. After all, any money they invest in their own factory is ultimately theirs."
"Longs wanted to see those extra decimal points on the big board, two weeks in a row! You can assess your investment in hundredths of pennies this weekend! Way to go!"
"This the only company where Bears dream about the product, in-wheel hub motor technology. Only four moving parts."

It’s very interesting that Goldman Sachs would come up with a sell rating for Ride this close to actual production! What changed?It makes you wonder about what’s the real motivation is! Having actually seen the pickup truck I’m still bullish on this stock!
Morgan Stanley! LOLlook at what happened with LUCID!!Morgan Stanley dropped their price rating and it shot up $7.00 by the next day. Now couple that with high short interest of RIDE and you will see that the analysts are just manipulating stocks for their own benefit. They have short position and are insuring their profits will be high. I own NO shares .... Sold out after the jump the other day.
"Hope fellow longs had a nice weekend. Noticing my recent posts related to MS analyst Adam Jonas and his inputs to his RIDE models were all were deleted … As mentioned in those posts, I’m a satisfied MS client, but Jonas’ logic/inputs are inconsistent in the absolute and relative to EV sector and were outlined in my posts. Not sure why these comments are deleted … assuming the paid basher contingent here doesn’t want real dialogue."
"In my opinion, Lordstown's relationship with Foxconn would be a shift to manufacturing as a service (MaaS) which is increasingly feasible and on-trend due to advancements that have been made in technology. The old traditional players in the industry have heavily depended on factories as a key component of their barriers to entry. Increasingly the factories of the big OEMs may become liabilities as it will be difficult for them to maneuver/shift production quickly and will probably have to spend significant amounts of time and money to retool factories that are bloated with union workers."
"After 31 days, bring back some more money..."
Ford actually lets analysts drive the new Lightning. wonder why lordstown couldn't allow them to do that...https://www.barrons.com/articles/ford-electric-f-150-lightning-review-51633804695

This is actually the worst investment decision i have made so far
Tomorrow will be another 25% down!

There are two potential directions for every stock. Going long because you think a stock will go up is not morally superior to thinking it will go down and selling short. I root for people to pick right.

Look for a Steve Burns conviction from the SEC/DOJ before his shares vest on the 26th
"Ride has no factory, no government approval from NHSTA, no money, and hoping to become an design company and sub contract out the production. How are the Pom Pom Cheerleaders Queens here going to try to flip those facts? They flipped production in September from the announced betas for validation to full production to some people. Let’s see how they try to flip the new information."

"It would take unpossible alien techmology to build an electric vehicle, powered by nothing more than batteries(!), and drive it around a parking lot. Clearly this is going to the moon."
Hopefully we trade higher today on new CFO!
"Personally, I feel safe about investing here for the long term.- No ongoing concern anymore- $230M and access to $400M secured, and more financing options are to be discussed- Foxconn will handle the production, which will limit estimation issues we've been facing-Foxconn is now a partner in Lordstown- The market capital now is one of the lowest in the industry (even for companies that don't have cars in the market yet)"
"I expect $6.89 PPS in the near future according to the Foxconn deal….. “Also, Hon Hai, which operates as Foxconn, has agreed to immediately purchase approximately $50 million in Lordstown Motors’ common stock from the company for $6.89 per share.”"
"Your downvotes sustain me.Name one Lordstown customer who ordered 20,000 trucks."
$8.80 Monday
"$$$ Phone assembler Foxconn is buying an automotive factory from struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors for around $230 million, the companies announced late Thursday. Foxconn says it has agreed to build Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck at the plant, which is where General Motors used to make the Chevrolet Cruze, and that the startup will remain a tenant there. Lordstown Motors will also “agree to provide Foxconn with certain rights with respect to future vehicle programs.”"

"Investors in Lordstown Motors Corp. RIDE need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 15, 2021 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today"
It will all come together soon.
The shorts are nervous this morning. Lol
"Well, all we could find was this hub motor, so let's change the tire..."
@I own putsNot many messages from you today!!...loosing faith in your puts?..are you shorting more?
$8 today!
"Patience holders, patience.."
What is the bull case on this stock?
it will be over 6 tomorrow!! mark my word shorties!!
"I expect some company communication soon. Have not had any since new CEO took over. Confirming pre market production and certification would put this stock in double digits. Announcing that, plus fresh major capital investment would send it to 20."
Louis Navellier the one that wrote the article against lordstown has a lawsuit from the SEC he has to pay more than $2m. This person might go to jail.
Waiting for lower levels…
"JD thinks everyone here bought in at 30.00 LMFAO. This is obviously a speculative stock and needs to be traded that way. All stocks are a gamble, the stock market itself right now is a huge gamble. Don’t put any money on a stock that you are not ok with to lose."
Did the 300th predicted short squeeze happen today? I’m on the golf course.
Dow will be 24-26k by December and RIDE will be at 1.50 you that know my 95% accurate price action predictions better take note!! Lol
"“I am very pleased to welcome Adam to our leadership team,” said Dan Ninivaggi, LMC’s Chief Executive Officer. “His deep understanding of the automotive industry and experience in financial operations and strategy will have an immediate impact as we focus on bringing our Endurance pickup truck to market and completing our recently announced partnership with Hon Hai Technology Group (“Foxconn”) (TWSE: 2317).”"
Lasttown Motors will be the last EV co. to produce an EV. If they ever produce one at all.
"I’d be very careful about seeing this new CFO as any kind of miracle cure for RIDE.First of all,he’s had a few “interim” short-term CFO gigs. He’s actually only been a CFO for about 3 months in his career.The CFO that just left had more experience than he does. This is his THIRD job in a year by my count.He was at a hydrogen fuel-cell scam company Hyzon for an entire FIVE MONTHS before moving on.Hyzon is another start up company that has fabricated orders and customers : https://fuelcellsworks.com/news/hyzon-motors-stock-crashes-on-scathing-short-seller-report/I’m more convinced than ever that Lordstown is an out-and-out scam company.They handed this guy 200,00 stock options and 250,000 shares of stock on top of a $450,000 salary ($8600/week for a company that is vaporizing money).All this for a guy thats been a CFO for a grand total of about 3 months in his whole career.Lordstown has ZERO revenue and a cash burn of about $250million per quarter.Financing options are non-existent (except for ruinous “payday loans” like the deal they cut with Foxconn),and they’re trusting their financial structure to a guy that has virtually no experience in his job? If I described this situation to you long investors and took the name off the story,how many of you would still buy or hold the stock?"
Ride was 11.29 when Steve Burns left. Just saying
"I'm underwater $20k on Ride. Irks the heck out of me....but at this point this stock is dead to me. If by some miracle of god this turns around then great, otherwise I'll write it all off and selling it now to save another $10k won't change my life."
$4.50 today?
"Just remember - Nio's stock was in the $3-$5 range for a little over a year and now it is at $36. Lordstown is not the same company, but the idea is that these are risk-on investments that are not for the timid. As with all risk-on investments, while there is a significant amount of downside, there is also a tremendous amount of upside. All start-ups hit a lot of bumps along the way - it is all about getting the right breaks, timing, and execution. Most of these negative posts have no substance - just distractions, trying to shake weak hands.There is an abundance of opportunity for those willing to do intense research and invest with conviction because they will understand the company better than most people outside of the company. This played out well for those who invested in GameStop, who understood how wrong Wall Street and investors were getting it.The arbitrage opportunity you have is in doing good research versus the lazy research and naysayers that just want to prey on people's emotions.Do your research, formulate an opinion, and invest with conviction."
Direct sales would allow LMC to keep its prices down and protect proprietary technology. Ohio already approved Tesla back in 2014. Catalyst!
"new CFO should fit right in given that he is coming from Hyson, another EV scam that used the SPAC route to go public, and is embroiled in lawsuits after being accused of lying about pre-orders..."
"When you could have sold for almost $9, but instead held out for half..."
LOL I'm bullish as never before .
Red tomorrow or W
The chances that Lordstown Motors will ever produce a production truck seem to be pretty remote. I see this firm being sold for its asset value and patent estate. The EV industry will go through consolidation -- Lordstown will likely be be the first of many that will not survive.
Worst management ever and that is saying a lot . They thought the FOxconn deal will hide their failure of not updating the market about production
"Still holding on to my 1000 little Lordstown turds… not much of a cheerleader here. I’ve decided to just sock it away and see if this company makes it. If they do, then maybe I get to actually buy an Endurance; it’s gotta make it to about $35/share for that to come to fruition, and it still won’t pay the whole bill… Nevertheless, an EV that can get 250 miles on a charge, and tow my trailer filled to the max (6000lbs) would suit me very well. Who knows, maybe it’s a Rivian, or Ford, or GM Chevy. I just happen to like the hub motor design."
Foxconn is going to leverage its vast experience with NHTSA to bring this home!
jay20 hours agoit will be over 6 tomorrow!! mark my word shorties!!wanted to save this before @jay deletes it
Remember October is the big $4 tunnel giveaway month...
This is a very good time to get in at 5. Which is a heavily discounted price IMO. Fox con building EV factory at Lordstown will be bringing more visibility to RIDE. Plus the new ceo is on track to bring RIDE to practical deadlines for truck deliveries. Data soeaks for itself. LMC PR has taken a positive turn too recently. All facts! Let’s forget the past and ride the RIDE with new CEO and foxcon partnership.
new CFO comes from an EV startup that is a mirror image of this lordstown scam. with luck he and the new CEO might be able to stabilize lordstown at a dollar a share...https://fuelcellsworks.com/news/hyzon-motors-stock-crashes-on-scathing-short-seller-report/
"Don't forget, baggies, Lordstown can't book the $230M until, and if, a definitive agreement is signed. Foxconn is holding all the cards."
Ain't that a hoot to see over $5 again...
I want this truck!
"Another record low close on the way, this is incredible."
Ride makes an appearance today
Added 5000 in addition to 5000 that I added premarket. All the best longs
"If Fisker can have same business model, is further away from pre production, doesn't own their own skateboard platform, and it has a 4 billion market cap, Lordstown is way underpriced."
"Money went to other places to make more money...np, will flow back to RIDE again! :)"
