Sam is the only ding=a=long trying to dig out of his money pit with buying below $5 and selling the pops above $5...
These fake accounts are being produced faster than the Endurances
"Lordstown...compared to Tesla.....anyone remember Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer, Saab?"
"New CEO. New CFO. Secured financial future with YA and strategic partnership with Foxconn (Apple) - $500m?? Backed by Ohio and gm because of jobs, carbon credit (at the very least). All this hype around -$146b in debt Ford…so weird?? I guess they’re planning on selling 14.6b F-150?? The evaluation of nikola, fisker and hylion. Huh???????"
What happened to the pitch to AMZN? Amazon takes stake in Rivian.
"Lordstown CEO Daniel Ninivaggi said in an interview the new partnership with Foxconn allows Lordstown to move to a less capital intensive business model and that the deal is expected to close in about six months.""We can get the benefits of scale without necessarily having to do it all on our own,"" Ninivaggi said."
Shame this should never go below $10
"FWIW, Megan Burns (daughter of Steve) was ""Front Office Manager"" at Workhorse (maybe still is --- see Linkedin).Posted a LOT of stuff about WKHS and RIDE.Not sayin the Yahoo poster is the same ""Megan"", but the real Megan B was a regular on Stocktwits for awhile."
"TSLA at trillion and we are not even a billion, soon market will recognize. Yes TSLA delivered, we will too..in near future."
"I know longs will be the winners...all the timeBut is today a short or a long's day, I mean close red or green? I go for green."
Pro was able to lasso up some dinner tonite...
"Nice! My shares are in the garage, growing up to become an Endurance"
Elon Musk acknowledged lordstown motor the $RIDE as one of good Ev trucks
Hi Megan!
"The stock is way above it's all-time low. To the moon. They have 100,000 orders and production started in September."
Lesson learnt is just keep adding when this goes below 5.
Look at what’s happening with LUCID when actually sales start and that’s exactly what will happen with RIDE!
Akron Soap Box Derby will be the target race venue for LMC in 2022. The competion in EV trucks is hot for this type of race!
"As we counted down the days until September production, now we're counting down to Foxconn / Hon Hai agreement. Should be a YUUUGE event."
"Look at MPLN, I only own 1500 shares, but they sold it down from $6.50 to $4.57 today in three weeks just because I bought some. They report in a few days."
LCID continues dragging this do-nothing but make excuses stock higher again...
By month end Foxconn deal will close......
"Finally, they announce Q3 Report on Nov.11th. Likely FoxConn agreement near ends today"
"Back in at 4.88, wash, rinse aaaaaaaand repeat."
"I’m wondering if Steve Burns us selling his￼ shares, or holding."
Are we getting details on Foxconn agreement after the close??? We were to get it by 31st which is Sunday.
"@Ryan Already went out yesterday at 5.08 for a 6% gain. Waiting for another sub 5 dip toooo…..you guessed it, wash, rinse, repeat."
Do you guys follow http://the-alphatrader.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the RIDE board - The alerts have been great!
Lordstown Motors is up 10.40% to 5.30
Hedge funds are loading around $5 will shoot to $10+ by ER
I buying every dip  at this price
6 is on its way !!!...
Drove past the lords town plant Thursday on my way to Michigan. The parking lot filled with employees cars.
We’re up after hours!
"In the San Felipe 250, Lordstown got stranded due to lack of charging stations in the critical areas they needed. The truck only made it 40 miles on the course, which was grueling deep soft sand last year. Nevertheless, no issues with the hub motors, and the truck pulled through deep soft sand mixed with refrigerator sized boulders. Unfortunately they calculated 3X normal battery usage, and it proved to be 4X, and they got caught short. The truck made it to the road to get charged, tried going back, but they realized they’d get stuck in the mountains with no way to charge, and ultimately bailed. The truck actually drove about 100 miles that day. No issues with the hub motors."
Wonder if someone's shares are being dumped?
When truck?
"So far, not any major selling prior to end of month. No indication of Lordstown getting any bad terms to the FoxConn agreement"
"Only 5 days left to iron out the Contract Manufacturing Agreement. Talk about squeezing, Foxconn is doing just that to RIDE's nether regions right now. Want to know who is nervous? Lordstown executives are sweating bullets. Foxconn could walk and pick everything up later at the fire sale. Without the $230 million for the plant Lordstown has no hope of coming up with the $800 million detailed in the revised spending plan. Foxconn saw how the market destroyed this stock. They no they are in the driver's seat."
How’s everyone doing? Are you all playing well together? My 1000 Lordsturds are still in the garage…
