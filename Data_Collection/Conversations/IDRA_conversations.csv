"This week’s lesson is about momentum trading.Let’s not forget the numbers. IDRA had a great week, full stop. Monday set the tone. IDRA only gained a penny, but it was a day when the rest of the market was doing a belly flop. But there was no gain on Tuesday in spite of a green market, and we’re thinking same old, same old.Weds. saw a 6-cent gain, but it was no reason for excitement. The stock did trade as high as $1.86, which was higher than it had in over two weeks. But only by a penny.Nobody expected that the stock would gain 13.4% on Thursday on 3x normal volume, and certainly nobody expected it to follow up Friday with another 9.36% on another high-volume day. By Friday’s close, the stock had gained 50 cents or a whopping 29.1% at $2.22. For 2020, the stock went from red (by 5.49%), to green (by 21.9%).The broader market was a bit mixed. The NAS actually took a step back, a rare occasion of late. It lost 1.08%, checking the pace of its 2020 gain to 17.06% (down from 18.3%).The DOW managed a nice gain of 2.29%. And for the first time in recent memory, BA went in the opposite direction, sliding 1.56% on the week. The DOW’s 2020 deficit was pared from 8.63% to 6.54%. My bio indexes had a fairly strong week. The BTK rose 2.29% (by pure coincidence, the same gain as the DOW); the IBB did better, up 3.41%; the XBI was right in the mix, up 3.32%. The XLV had a fine week, leading the pack with a gain of 5.14%. The VXX went back to its usual level of volatility of late, hopping like a ping-pong ball in inverse proportion to the market. Since the market was generally up, the VXX went down, by 4.76% to close at $30.62. On 7/17/19, IDRA closed at $2.61. This is a tougher comparison than last week, but IDRA had a stellar week, so the YoY deficit shrunk from 32.5% to 14.9%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.71-1.84T 1.71-1.75W 1.76-1.86Th 1.83-2.07F 1.92-2.24 And from last week:M 1.75-1.85T 1.75-1.80W 1.50-1.81Th 1.66-1.80F 1.71-1.77 I had a plan for this week. A message of caution. ‘Sure, it’s been a big week’, I’d say. ‘But the market is headed for a waterfall. So 2 weeks from now, if the market is in free fall and IDRA is tumbling with all the other waves, remember this moment.’Yup, that’s what I was going to say. Until Mr. Momentum reminded me of its presence.How did it remind me? By making me eat my words. A couple weeks ago, I poo-poo’d NVAX. Yeah, it’s at the table at the White House, I said. But it’s never gotten a vaccine approved. There’s no “there” there, I said.Yeah. Well. Wanna know how NVAX did just this week? It gained 48.9%. For the past two weeks, that figure is 72.1%. So you can guess what I’m having for breakfast this morning. A big serving of crow.But….many here may have noticed what happened AH last night. In case you didn’t, IDRA merely. Went. Crazy.First, IDRA seldom trades AH. If it does, it’s seldom on a Friday. And, when there is an AH trade or two, the volume is almost always in the hundreds of shares, barely a blip on the screen.Not last night. Not at all. Immediately after the closing bell, huge trades started hitting the tape, with the stock well up. When I checked, it was up 28.4% at $2.85. And it had hit $3.25 in that AH session. I believe the last trade was over $3.00.And the volume? Amazing! The 3-month average daily volume for IDRA is 275,000 shares. Last night, it traded over a million shares, AH alone.And of course, there’s no news.But I’ll say this: that kind of movement, on that kind of volume, is significant. I’m expecting some sort of news between now and Monday morning’s open.Um, I suppose I should caution realism here. I SHOULD say, ‘remember that IDRA has never had a drug approved before’.But not today. My message today is, BRING IT ON, BABY! BRING ON THE MO-MO!! LET’S TAKE A RIDE!!!Because this might be a moment in the sun. Hold on to every share, and consider adding. This could get really exciting.Sarge"
"Looking through the 10K, there are a couple of interesting items:1. They have slowed the quarterly spend significantly. This is (I think) the downsizing at work.2. ATM was tapped for half a million shares during the quarter yielding roughly 1.5 million dollars.3. Lincoln Park facility was not utilized at all during the quarter (although they did issue about a quarter million shares to LP as a ""fee"" for setting up the facility.4. Out-licensed unnamed ""non-core"" assets to unknown recipient that will result in 1.4 million being paid to IDRA in Q2.5. Baker Bros Advisors exercised two and a half million warrants that converted to a like number of shares. Notably, this cost the BBs $3.76 per share, resulting in 9.5 million in cash to IDRA. BB could have bought those same shares on the open market for far less, but instead they paid more by exercising the warrants - the difference being that the warrant exercise puts money in IDRA's pockets while buying on the open market would have kept money in BBs pockets. 6. All of this activity has diluted IDRA stockholder by something like 3.2 million shares, but I can't find any place in the 10K that states the total number of outstanding shares. I may have to reach out to Bob on that one.7. I did not see much new in the various descriptions of the trials, although I did note that they appear to still mention the tilso-pembro trial in melanoma. I also note that the new phase 2 trials in Head and Neck and Colorectal will begin with patients that are immunotherapy naive, and then will enroll relapsed patients ""at the appropriate time."" Looks like they are trying to get a less sick population for these trials.Just my quick review. Please jump in if you saw something else interesting. Good luck folks."
"IDRA is on its way. The question is, will the trip be worth it? One thing is for sure: it will be long and it will be strange.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA broke a two-week losing streak, rising 12 cents or 4.71% to close at $2.67. For 2019, IDRA made a little headway, moving the loss from 7.94% to 3.61%. The sector also had a good week. The NAS made it two green weeks in a row, gaining 2.71%. For 2019, the index is now green by 19.6%. My bio indicators were all green: the BTK set a brisk pace with a gain of 2.61%; the IBB did better, up 2.8%; the XBI was Best of Breed, up 3.6%. The XLV was green but only a little, nudging up 0.27%. The DOW had a solid week with a gain of 1.91%. For 2019, the index is now up 13.3%. On 4/5/18, IDRA closed at $13.36 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss “improved” from 82.6% to 80%. Try to contain your excitement.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.52-2.64T 2.58-2.85W 2.71-2.87Th 2.61-2.83 F 2.65-2.76And from last week:M 2.55-2.72T 2.55-2.71W 2.50-2.65Th 2.50-2.64 F 2.51-2.66The ILLUMINATE-101 data came out this week. Many thanks to @Tursta for on the spot analysis on this and all aspects of trial data.I was chatting with @Alridge95 about this news. With combo therapy seeming to be the wave of the future in cancer treatment, I can see the day when a product is developed solely to enhance the efficacy of an existing medication, which has no efficacy on its own.What will happen then? I suspect it will be a long, drawn-out battle, and that ultimately the FDA will acknowledge that efficacy as a sole treatment is not essential to approval. I’m just glad Tilso did not have to be the guinea pig for this issue.Now, we can concentrate on the real issue: whether Tilso is better than the other TLR 9 agonists that are in development as well. And who will get to market first.The next data is due in a few months as I recall. We have seen how devastating it can be to stockholders when there is a headline “miss” regarding a trial’s objectives (even when not merited). We are on the brink of some exciting times.Sarge"
"Nice volume and price action today. That should get lots of eyes on the story. I don't post much anymore but I assure you that is not due to lack of interest or financial commitment. My musings have been mostly about vetting the clinical science and the mechanistic strategies rather than MC, PPS, ATMs etc. As we now enter the final push toward commercialization/approval and maturation of the company and science I very much appreciate the financial/technical types here that have our backs posting their thought as we go forward. I think this is going to get exciting not only financially but as an agent that has wide reach in extending both the quality and duration of lives not just in melanoma. I will say I am not in total agreement that we can expect some improvement in the ORR in the Phase 3. While the strategy has been to now use this in less sick patients rather than essentially all comers common in Phase 2 trials, this has to be balanced by the historical tendency of Phase 3 results often not quite being as stellar as Phase 2 results. Hopefully cleaning up the selection criteria will counteract this tendency. Suffice it to say if we maintain the 20+% ORR and the 75+% DCR with the confirmed excellent safety record for Tilso and the essentially one and done strategy, then we should be in great position. Good luck all."
IDRA is a victim fraudulent media mob. I sincerely hope that you find reason to to rethink and take back your position. I just bought the dip.
"At $155 million market cap and looking like support with a potential blockbuster on our hands, this is WAY undervalued now. I’m a buyer today."

"New CMO has a nice Ivy League pedigree, but I am not sure how I feel about someone with a background in cardiology (no offense Tursta) and internal medicine who is quoted as saying that she is excited to learn how tilso can benefit these patients. I am probably making more out of this than is warranted, but her background does not strike me as ideal for an oncology-focused biotech. Maybe I am missing the point, but it is a bit of a head-scratcher for me."
"IDRA took a pause this week. And, it’s not the end of the world.Let’s look at the numbers. It all comes down to Tuesday, when IDRA took advantage of a down sector to get a week’s worth of red in a day. It lost 9.7%.The rest of the week was fine. Green 3 days, and even on the 4th. But even added up, the non-red days could not outdo Tuesday, and the stock closed down 36 cents or 6.05% to close at $5.59. A look at the bright side: the stock is 24.8% above the closing price two weeks ago, AND, YTD, the gain is still 51.5%.The broader market was generally depressing. The NAS gave back most of its gains on the year, falling 3.49%. Its gain for 2021 dropped from 5.46% to 1.77%.The DOW went from green to red on the year, losing 3.27% on the week, to create a loss of 1.39% for 2021. BA has struggled so far this year. This week, it lost 5.66%. Its loss on the year grew to 8.99%.My bio indexes were generally unsupportive. The BTK led the way (down), losing 2.87%; the IBB was only slightly better, down 2.46%; the XBI managed a tiny gain of 0.21%. The XLV went along with the majority, down 2.18%. The VXX had a party this week. Amid uncertainty in politics and in the market, it sprang back to life, surging 28.5% to $21.08..On January 29, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.77. The YoY comparison is still a gaudy gain of 216%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 5.70-6.10T 5.35-6.09W 5.26-5.94Th 5.27-5.69F 5.50-6.12And from TWO WEEKS AGO:M 4.10-4.38T 4.13-4.34W 4.02-4.30Th 4.12-4.39F 4.15-4.49I think it was @Anonymousrex who referred to IDRA’s stock having “elasticity” this week. I thought that was an appropriate adjective. This stock seems to bounce back very well these days.To be honest, IDRA was due for a little pullback, after last week’s spectacular showing. So when Tuesday came and the sector was tumbling, it was an ideal time for some folks to take some profits in IDRA.I don’t begrudge that. I think it’s a healthy thing. A stock that goes straight up, generally, will come straight down. The occasional correction or pullback will help, in the long run.This week, not for the first time, IDRA again seemed to reset itself in a very efficient way. Last Thursday (Jan. 21), the stock hit a 52-week trading high of $6.14. Four sessions later, on Wednesday, the stock hit a low of $5.26. That’s a 14.3% correction.The next session, Thursday, the bears could only get the stock down to $5.27. Friday, the stock was back to flirting with the 52-week high, trading as high as $6.12.Yes, the late afternoon was a disappointment, and yes @Brian, I crowed too early, and likely jinxed us. Hopefully I’ll get a chance to crow soon, and this time I’ll wait…The stock has indeed come far. Look to the daily trading ranges. Note that I printed the ranges from two weeks back. Notice anything? It’s ALL 4-handles.We’ve come a long way. And the run is just beginning. Hold on to your shares.Sargehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjG9wK-Cn-o"
"One thing to keep in mind as we compare Tilso results in melanoma to others is that the patient populations, number of prior treatments, and severity of illness vary widely. It is unlikely that Tilso, or any other agents studied will become standard of care or the only adjuvant agent used with the current CPIs. Rather, like traditional chemotherapy regimens that have been used for decades, there could be perhaps as many as 4 or 5 agents used together or staggered in a treatment course. So comparing the best ORR for instance in these early studies does not necessarily constitute or award a single “winner”. It will also be important to demonstrate safety in combination with several other agents and additive benefit. So until a single agent is able to cure melanoma (unlikely) there will be many agents considered as part of a multi agent synergistic regimen.Another aspect of melanoma treatment is that it is often chosen as a proving ground for new agents since lesions are easy to image, access and evaluate action and results are often accelerated compared to other cancers. So while it is important to show benefit in melanoma the end game is gathering data and momentum for many other solid tumors, a multi billion dollar market. In other words safety and efficacy demonstrated in melanoma is a springboard to the bigger prize of solid tumors. Of course in an apples to apples comparison to other agents we want Tilso to stack up well. Just remember it is only a first step in the big picture."
"I just love it when my stock keeps hitting 52-week highs.Let’s look at the numbers. After hitting 52-week highs for trading and closing last Friday, it wasn’t too surprising when the stock went red Monday of this week. Just 4 cents – no need to panic. Then Tuesday was much more of the same, as the stock lost 7.58%. Could our joy be slipping away so quickly?But the next session, the stock gained back 11 cents or 2.82%, closing over $4 and making me feel like the stock might end up with a smallish loss on the week. Ending green? Forget it. Not after gaining 50% last week.But in Friday’s shortened session, the stock rallied 6.98% to close the week UP 3 cents (0.7%) to give us a new closing high at $4.29. For the calendar year, the stock is now up 135.7%. The broader market was green on this holiday-shortened week. The NAS had a nice gain of 2.96%. Setting all time closing highs Weds. and Friday, its gain on the year rose to 36%. The DOW had a very respectable showing, up 2.21%, and closing over 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday. The calendar year’s gain grew to 4.81%.BA continued its charge back to respectability. It followed up last week’s gain of 6.69% with another 8.46% rise. Lest it get too proud, it’s still down on the year by 33.5%.My bio indexes were in on the party. The BTK had a solid gain of 2.16%; the IBB was better, climbing 3.13%; the XBI was top dog, soaring 4.3%. The XLV was a laggard, up 0.59%. The VXX made it 4 red weeks in a row, losing 5.86%, and closing at $17.51.On 11/27/19, IDRA closed at $1.76. This friendly comparison means the YoY gain improved from 113% to 143.75%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.00-4.78T 3.78-4.28W 3.84-4.11Th ThanksgivingF 4.00-4.47 And from last week:M 2.63-2.87T 2.76-3.04W 3.01-3.43Th 3.36-3.70F 3.59-4.90As I have noted in the past, part of the reason I write every week is to give myself a reason to stand back and take perspective.This week, my exercise took me to the trading range for Monday of last week. That session, November 16, IDRA had a trading range from $2.63-$2.87. It closed at $2.76. That’s two weeks ago. Friday, November 27, the stock closed at $4.29. Increase in closing price: 55.4%.When one of my stocks has a hot streak, I often wonder if I should take some profits. It’s like, the longer and the faster it goes up, the more the feeling of “this can’t last” creeps in.Stocks DO NOT just go up every session. As much as we’d like them to. So, when a stock of mine gains, say, 50% in a week (like THAT happens often!), I wonder when the inevitable pullback is coming.This time, IDRA seems to have take care of it already. The stock hit a trading high of $4.90 last Friday, November 20. Three sessions later, on Tuesday, 11/24, it hit a trading low of $3.78. The difference between zenith and nadir: 22.8%.That’s a full correction. And now, yesterday, the stock rallies to a new 52-week closing high. Seemingly full steam ahead, with the correction out of the way.I’m not complaining. Just amazed.Enjoy your stay in Quad Country. It will probably be brief, one way or the other!Sarge"

"So 13F filings are now due. I have not done a full review yet, but it is interesting that the Bakers reduced their IDRA exposure by 234K shares, or about a 5% reduction. This is the first time I have seen a sale of IDRA shares by the Bakers. Of course this could be a very troubling sign, but I need to do a little more research before I get too concerned. There are at least two reasons for this. First, the Bakers have warrants that will convert to shares in the not to distant future and they have a cap at 19.9%. It is possible that this could have been a situation where they took advantage of the run up in PPS to trim the position in anticipation of that conversion. However I need to go back and look at the size of the conversion to see if this is a plausible explanation. Second, I looked at the Bakers entire filing. They trimmed each of their top 6 holdings in amounts ranging from 1 to 6%. Of course, IDRA is not one of their top 6, but the point is that they seem to be raising a bit of cash. As soon as I have done a more thorough analysis I will post the results."
Dr. Diab also was in charge of the NKTR-214 trials & also their combo with nktr's TLR-9...back in 2016 & 2017...so to hear him insinuate that IMO~2125 is superior..is interesting...especially when billions were offered by BMY.....i realize NKTR-214 may be classified not as a TLR agonist.....but regardless is still an immune modulator (stimulator)...............
"The roof did not cave in on IDRA this week. Some perspective is in order.Let’s look at the numbers. After two stellar weeks in a row, IDRA was probably due for a pull back. Just about all the damage was done on Monday. While the rest of the market cheered the Pfizer news, the home team lost 9.18% in one day. In the final four sessions of the week, the stock lost a total of 3 cents, as the stock closed the week down 32 cents or 10.1% at $2.84. For the calendar year, the stock is still up 56%.The broader market was generally supportive. Uncharacteristically, the NAS did not lead the festivities, as it lost 0.55% on the week. The index’s gain on the year dipped from 32.6% to 31.8%, still an impressive showing in volatile times. The DOW was the largest beneficiary of the rally, closing with a gain of 4.31%. The calendar year tally changed from a loss of 0.75% to a gain of 3.29%.BA was once again a driver of the DOW, up 18.6%, as transports surged thanks to the promise of a vaccine. For the year, its loss improved from 51.6% to 42.6%.My bio indexes were all shades of green. The BTK came in with a respectable gain of 1.35%; the IBB was a notch better, gaining 2.41%; the XBI was Best of Breed, up 4.31%. The XLV had a solid gain of 2%. As the market surged, the VXX reeled again. After losing 22.7% last week, it lost another 7.02% this week, closing at $19.08.On 11/13/19, IDRA closed at $2.09. That’s a much friendlier comparison than last week ($2.52). Thanks to that, the YoY gain improved from 25.4% to 35.9%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.84-3.32T 2.67-3.04W 2.80-2.92Th 2.74-2.92F 2.73-2.85 And from last week:M 2.72-2.97T 2.90-3.14W 3.00-3.47Th 3.19-3.39F 3.12-3.36After two weeks of ticker-tape parades, we were bound to have to sweep the streets at some point. It’s never a pleasant task.But I think it was just a pause, in the grand scheme of things.First, look at how far we’ve come. 3 Fridays ago, on 10/23, the stock closed at $2.27 (and it had to rally a bit to get there). Since that time, even including this week’s haircut, the stock has gained 25.1%. Not a bad 3-week return if you ask me.I was also encouraged by the lack of follow-through on the selling. After losing a total of 42 cents between last Friday and this Monday, the stock has been red two of four sessions, and as I mentioned before, lost a total of 3 cents.In prior days here, after IDRA would climb a peak, stock price wise, it would usually descend from that peak as fast as it went up, if not faster.Not this time. This time, after hitting a nice high of $3.47, the stock has pulled back, but then settled on a plateau in the $2.80’s. If you get time, pull up a 6-month chart. The price where the stock levels off after a surge upward keeps getting higher. Especially this time.We may founder here for a while. We may re-test the low of $2.67 that printed Tuesday. But IMO, the next significant move for this stock is up. There’s too much promise in all these combo trials for Tilso, for the stock to be denied.Sarge"
"28%+ ORR----70% stable disease----5-10% Complete response--------no severe reactions. This is the minimum I am looking for and have high confidence that the readout will be at least as good. With these numbers the stock goes to $750 million MC at a minimum. That is a stock price between $18 and $20 a share. Being first to market and adopted as part of the standard of care treatment for refractory melanoma patients(to begin with) and then part of first line treatment should get the market cap up to at least $1-1.5 billion. And that's not even considering the very high possibility of acquisition by the likes of BMY, MRK, or another pharma company looking to boost it's oncology portfolio. Turning onto the home stretch here. Very exciting time."

"This is, apparently, Quad Country. We like the Number 4!Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA took a full step back this week (though in context, the stock is in great shape – more later). While it gained over 5% Tuesday, it lost over 13% combined over the next 2 sessions, closing the week down 43 cents (8.83%) at $4.44. For the year, the gain is still 144%. The broader market was mixed, with the upper hand going to small caps. The NAS gave back 0.69%. That’s ok: its yearly gain is still 37.95%.The DOW was also red, also not by much: it slid 0.57%. Its calendar year gain is now 5.28%.BA had a small pause in what appears to be the road back to prior trading levels. It lost 1.02%, raising its deficit since New Year’s from 28.6% to 29.3%.My bio indexes had a definite slant toward small caps. The BTK lost 1.37%; the IBB, however, rose 1.62%; the XBI was the clear winner, up 4.46% (it had a huge Thursday). The XLV ended green, but by just 0.76%.The VXX snapped a 5-week losing streak, gaining 89 cents or 5.2% to close at $18.00.On 12/11/19, IDRA closed at $1.64. The YoY gain shrunk from 178% to 171%. Oh, the pain.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.71-5.00T 4.71-5.18W 4.62-5.08Th 4.15-4.74F 4.35-4.68 And from last week:M 3.95-4.46T 4.11-4.43W 4.20-5.29Th 4.91-5.37F 4.62-5.04After the heady days of sporting a 5-handle (there were 6 of them!), it’s a little hard to appreciate the beauty of a 4-handle.I’ll admit that at this point, it’s an acquired taste.But look where we’ve come from, and how fast it’s happened. Exactly 4 Fridays ago (11/13), the stock closed at $2.84. Quad Country was, it seemed, a distant dream.But look now. Friday’s closing price of $4.44 (which some might call a Perfect Number) was exactly 56.3% higher than it had been, exactly 4 weeks prior.If someone had asked me on 11/13, how I’d feel if the 12/11 closing price was $4.44, I’d have said, “where do I sign up for that?”.That’s not all the good news. For the second time in a couple weeks, IDRA has managed to fold in a full correction into its trading. Last Thursday, 12/3, the stock hit a trading high of $5.37. One week later, it hit a trading low of $4.15. The difference between high and low? 22.7%. With a little market support, I think IDRA is poised for another leg up.So enjoy your stay in the lush surroundings of Quad Country. We might not be staying long.Sarge"
"If a stock could have a nickname, I’d be tempted to dub IDRA “the comeback kid”.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA has had a mini-trend of late, to perform rather poorly in the first 3 or even 4 sessions of the week, then rally in the latter sessions. This week was more of the same as it went red the first 3 days, digging itself into a 17-cent hole. Thursday showed a little hope with a gain of 4 cents, but the stock was still 13 cents down for the week. I figured we were headed red for a second week in a row.But the stock rallied 14 cents Friday afternoon to put it up a penny (0.44%) to close at $2.27. For the year, the stock is now up 24.7%.The broader market was not helpful. After 4 green weeks in a row, the NAS went red by 1.65% Monday and never recovered. Final tally was a loss of 1.06%. Its gain on the year dipped to 28.7%, which is still impressive for late October. The DOW performed similarly to its younger sibling, down 0.95%. This erased its tiny gain for the year, bringing the score down to red by 0.71%. BA ended in a virtual dead heat for a second straight week, as it gained exactly one penny to close at $167.36. For the year, its loss continues to remain at 48.6%.My bio indexes were less helpful. The BTK lost 1.94%; the IBB did worse, down 2.3%; the XBI was the most motley of the bunch, down 2.48%. The XLV almost broke even, sliding 0.09%. For a second straight week, the VXX ended up just about where it started. It closed at $22.17, a loss of ten cents. It seems like the market is holding its breath until the election.On 10/24/19, IDRA closed at $2.71. That’s 4 cents higher than last week’s comparison. Given this week’s tiny gain, the YoY loss grew from 15.35% to 16.2%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.15-2.27T 2.11-2.30W 2.04-2.17Th 2.10-2.17F 2.13-2.28 And from last week:M 2.30-2.40T 2.21-2.33W 2.21-2.32Th 2.13-2.25F 2.16-2.31So what do we make of this trend for the stock to come back and turn losses into gains late in the week? While the daily gains are impressive, as Brian pointed out last night, it’s not on much volume.And that’s what makes it so strange. As I noted last week, in my observation, stocks that trade in the neighborhood of 100,000 shares per day are vulnerable.Avanir Pharmaceuticals (AVNR) was a great example. Its pattern would be the opposite of what we’re seeing here with IDRA. It’s been years now, but it seemed like the stock would scratch together a gain of 4 or 5 cents heading into Friday (this is when it was basically a $1.00 stock), and then would try and hold the week’s gain.But like I said, it was thinly traded. It seemed like inevitably, there would literally be a 100-share trade at 3:59 to take the stock from green to red. The phrase “painting the tape” came up often.Why ISN’T that happening here with IDRA? Note that yesterday’s volume was just under 82,000 shares.These are the tea leaves I’m seeing. I’d welcome any theories as to what they’re saying.Sarge"

"Bollinger bands on IDRA chart are VERY tight, the tightest in a long time. A breakout could be coming, and when it does it will be strong and to the upside. The MC for the stock is way too low and should be somewhere above $250-$300 million, which is about the historical average over the past few years. That would take the stock back up over $10, which I see as a reasonable valuation given the trial results and effectiveness so far of tilso. And if the stock can get back above the $5 threshold then institutional buying will pick back up."
"Apexigen grabbed the headlines yesterday at AACR with APX005M which in Combination Therapy with Nivo was Well Tolerated and Induced Tumor Shrinkage in 20 of 24 Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer, Several Patients on Therapy for Over a Year. Of note they did not mention how much tumor shrinkage.You may remember that IDRA had an important abstract using IMO-2125 in MICE exactly 2 years ago that demonstrated great tumor reduction, abscopal effect and importantly tumor memory in pancreatic CA. Jump ahead to the monotherapy study IDRA presented yesterday and it appears that with Tilso, Interferon alpha signaling occurred in all the patients that had pancreatic cancer. Hopefully this results in tumor shrinkage as well. We don't have the details yet.Clearly the dismal outcomes in pancreatic CA puts it on everyone's radar as a difficult to treat cancer. Like IDRA, APX is choosing to go after difficult to treat cancers AND develop an agent that can be paired with different CPIs in many cancers. From their PR: ""We are committed to advancing a broad clinical development program for APX005M in multiple types of cancer as we work toward transforming the standard of care for patients across a wide range of cancer indications."" Today they are presenting their melanoma data. It should be interesting to see if they can ""steal the show"" as the headlines read 2 days in a row.This somewhat confirms that IDRA has a good strategy. It would help if Tislo grabs some headlines. We know Tilso is safe. It also needs to be one of the best immune enhancers going forward. Things are heating up in the CPI combo field. BTW Tilso also showed impressive Interferon signaling in a limited number of patients in breast and soft tissue sarcoma. This could get very interesting."
"Monday was terrific. Then the light on the dashboard came on.Let’s look at the numbers. Monday was indeed fine, with the stock gaining 4.36%, and never getting close to the prior Friday’s closing price – green all day.Then we moved from the Emerald City to Red City. The rest of the week combined for a loss of 7.8%. When the dust settled, the stock was down 20 cents or 3.79% to close at $5.07.Reality check: this is the 4th straight week the stock has closed every session with a 5-handle. And YTD, the stock is still up a pride-inducing 37.4%.The broader market had a similar story, with generally tepid results. The NAS did close the week at yet another all-time closing high, rising 1.73%. Its gain for 2021 stands at 9.76%. It’s mid-February, friends.The DOW also found its way to the record books, gaining 0.99% to end at an all-time closing high. On the year, it’s gained 3.45%, which is a gaudy number by its standards. BA followed up a gain of 7.07% last week with a more modest gain of 1.47%. Its loss on the year is down to 1.13%.My bio indexes were a mixed bag. The BTK slid 0.84%; the IBB, meanwhile, was green by 0.99%; the XBI, despite gaining 4.3% on Monday, closed the week down 1.47%. The XLV ended up the Winner this week with a gain of 1.39%. If there was a party, the VXX missed it. It closed the week down 4.43% at $15.74.On February 12, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.59. The YoY gain remains a stunning 218.8%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 5.34-5.55T 5.28-5.60W 5.12-5.53Th 4.96-5.22F 4.95-5.40And from last week:M 5.36-5.70T 5.30-5.71W 5.30-5.73Th 5.26-5.68F 5.20-5.60Technical analysts will tell you it really doesn’t matter what business a company does. By seeing its trading patterns, they can predict the movement of a stock.The funny thing is, they’re often right.But I have always held that ultimately, value is the thing that drives a stock’s price. The thing that drives value, of course, is earnings.So it’s a mix, IMO. Value plus technical.In IDRA’s case, as is often the situation in pharma development, there is no income. Stock price pops most often come as a result of news of clinical results.If the company posts results that exceed expectations, pow! A stock that’s been languishing for weeks can shoot up 30% or 40% or more in a day, on huge volume. But it seldom lasts.After a day or two of glory and checking the market every 10 minutes, many pharma stocks will come back to earth pretty quickly. In spite of the promise, income is still a distant dream.Why, then, has IDRA not settled back these past few months? With each dramatic rise, the stock has settled a bit, but never back to where it came from. Glance at a 6-month chart.Why? @Andy reminded me to look at the company’s 2021 Corporate Statement. Tilso looks likely to knock it out of the park when the 301 results for melanoma come out later this quarter. And the story does not end there. There are many other types of cancer this drug can help, as it “bird dogs” for tumors in the body. Some of them have no current effective treatments.That’s the value the analysts see. Even discounting for the time spent waiting for FDA approval, the value is too great to discount all together.So we wait, and buy on the dips. Here’s some nice waiting music to keep us company.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96UgSarge"
"IDRA held its own this week. So we longs watch and wait. Feels a little like fishing.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA took what we hope is a brief pause in its march upward, giving back 2 cents or 0.7% to close at $2.83. We haven’t quite reached the greener pastures of a 3-handle, but it’s still in sight. For 2019, IDRA is still officially making progress, with a 2.17% gain. Not time to write home just yet.The sector provided nice support. The NAS rose 0.9%, bringing its 2019 gain up to 14.5%. My bio indicators, meanwhile, went hog wild: the BTK surged 4.29%; the IBB was just behind, up 3.97%; the XBI was the Star, soaring 7.08%. The XLV didn’t win, place or show, nudging up 0.43%. The DOW was up Friday, but not quite enough to make it a green week, off by just 0.02%. On the year, the gain is now 11.57%. This breaks the winning streak to begin 2019 for the oldest index.On 3/1/18, IDRA closed at $14.24 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down half a percent to 80.1%. This…is a depressing statistic. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.80-3.05T 2.88-2.98W 2.88-3.09Th 2.71-3.02 F 2.64-2.84And from last week:M President’s DayT 2.52-2.67W 2.58-2.72Th 2.59-3.09 F 2.73-3.15IDRA continues to make progress. It’s a slow slog – just the nature of the beast.But this week, on Wednesday, the company announced the completion of enrollment for the Illuminate 204 trial for the combo of Tilso and Ipilimumab following failure of PD-1 Inhibitor treatment. This is a significant milestone, though it was met with yawns on the Street.Last night, our friend Tursta shared his insights for the abstract for AACR, which admittedly is basically a place-holder until the data comes out. But it’s coming out. We just have to wait. Time IS on our side, if the trends we’ve seen to date continue.I want to share a call I made this week (sorry to those who have read this on the SPPI board). I have a small position in NVAX. It was 1,100 shares at the beginning of the week. Not much in the grand scheme, but it sure took a chunk out of my portfolio when news hit that they’d missed the primary endpoint of a vaccine trial on Thursday. The vaccine was administered to pregnant mothers, in hopes of preventing RSV in infants.The stock had closed at $2.13 on Wednesday. After the news hit, the stock was trading at 71 cents, a 66.7% discount. Oh, my.But then I looked at the trial results. The goal was 40%. The vaccine was effective in 39.1% of the patients. And, in the American cohort, they administered the vaccine later in pregnancy, when it was less effective.So I added. For about $400.00, I added 450 shares to my little position, which is now 40.9% bigger than it was 2 days ago. Yesterday, the stock got as high as 85 cents, making me feel smart for about a minute, before it settled back down. I’ll have to wait for gratification. Oh yeah, it’s the market.But I’ll wait, and I’ll watch. If I like what I see and hear, I may add more while prices are this low. It will bring down my average purchase price and let’s face it: I don’t have unlimited resources. If I can add while a stock is temporarily out of favor, I get more bang for my buck.We investors wait and watch. Patience is a virtue. Stubbornness doesn’t hurt, either.Sarge"

"Yes, we are miles away from Quad Country. But it could be worse.Let’s look at the numbers. After losing 10.3% last week, IDRA was in a pitcher’s duel through Thursday, with the stock not closing more than 3 cents higher or lower in the first 4 sessions. Friday morning, the stock was up by just a penny, and the fate of the week was a toss of the coin. But Friday, the stock took advantage of a sector tailwind and gained 5 cents to end the week up by 3.28%, at $1.89.The broader market had a pretty good week, with bio pharma leading the way (UP this time). The NAS broke a 2-week losing streak, surging an even 6%. Its 2020 tally turned from a loss of 4.09% to a gain of 1.66% in the space of a week. Who gets the credit? The usual suspects. The likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google (and a couple others) have kept the index afloat.The DOW gained back 2.56%, trimming its 2020 loss from 16.87% to 14.7%. Why is the DOW down while the NAS is basking in the green? Look no further than BA, which has lost, drum roll please, over 59% this year.My bio indexes staged an impressive comeback. The BTK outdid the NAS, surging 6.9%; the IBB was right behind, up 6.21%; the XBI was not to be outdone, rocketing 9.62%. The relatively conservative XLV turned in a ho-hum week by comparison, up 1.62%. The volatility indicator, the VXX, had a tough week. Green in only 1 of 5 sessions, the ETN tumbled 15.1% to close at $34.95. On 5/8/19, IDRA closed at $3.60. The week’s gain could not undo a much tougher comparison, and the YoY loss grew from 37.96% to 47.5%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.00-2.05T 1.90-2.05W 1.82-1.89Th 1.79-1.87F 1.79-1.95 And from last week:M 1.73-1.85T 1.17-1.93W 1.92-2.05Th 1.90-2.00F 1.75-1.91 It’s not a stock market. It’s a market of individual stocks. Such a cliché, but so much truth.I listed 3 of the 4 “FANG” stocks earlier, and how they were leading the NAS. Let’s see how they are doing in 2020. All are green; some more impressively than others. FB is up 3.46%; AMZN is up 28.8%; NFLX is up 34.6%; and GOOG is up 3.8%. I wonder where the NAS would be, without those four stocks? (I’d also include, MSFT, which is up 17.1%.)The other end of the spectrum? Pick a sector.Airlines: I follow LUV because I used to hold it (sold my last shares a year or so back). This week, I noted that it set new 52-week lows on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. THAT’s not the kind of streak you want! Its 2020 tally: down 49.5%, even after gaining 6.9% yesterday.Retail: a leader is Macy’s (M). It closed 2019 at $17.00. Yesterday, it closed at $5.37. That’s a YTD loss of 68.4%.Energy: EOG closed last year at $83.76. It closed Friday at $51.45, a loss of 38.6%. XOM closed on 12/31 at $69.78; yesterday it closed at $46.19 – the YTD loss is 33.8%. Note that while the carnage isn’t as bad for these two stocks as for the comparisons above, this sector has rallied significantly from its lows in March.Where is little old IDRA in all this? Actually better than all four of these comparisons for 2020, with a GAIN of 3.84%. Are the stock and the company home free? With a 2-handle still giving me warm fuzzy thoughts? No way. But it COULD be worse.I would be remiss not to mention AKBA (the former KERX). This week, it went from $7.98 to $11.98, a gain of 50.1%, based on some great Phase III trial results for its drug Vadadustat.Are we in the best sector with IDRA? No. Are we in one of the worst? No! I suspect this market rally will fizzle, and we will hit some choppy waters (again). If it does, don’t panic about IDRA. We’re one piece of good news away.Sarge"
"After spending most of the last two month under the 8 day exponential moving average, it has just sneaked back above that line, although only barely. The MACD is not showing much of anything one way or another and the RSI is only 45, which is consistent with the low-ish volume recently. To my very untrained eye this little ride up is not particularly strong (yet) but there are not any glaring alarms either. I wish it was more definitive but I just don't see any real support under the price as of yet. Like Rome, trends are not built in a day."
"A quick look at the Dynavax and Nektar ASCO data or lack thereof makes me happy we are in IDRA. These 2 companies have not put forward straight forward PRs which leads to speculation that they are hiding something or cherry picking patients to pad the numbers.....whether they are or not the impression is there. The drop and PPS that both have received today may be as much due to the vagueness of their PRs as the actual data. A quick look at some of the message boards to me indicates that even the followers of these companies are having a hard time interpreting the data available. Also very interesting is that everyone seems to be comparing Dynavax, Nektrar, and Checkmate in the TLR-9 space without considering or even mentioning IDRA. The many contributors on the IDRA board have had no problem absorbing and evaluating the data. Granted we have a very active and intelligent message board but I think IDRA has nothing to hide and present the data accordingly. In fact IDRA has much to be boastful about but it has not been their style to overstate or demonstrate hyperbole....almost to a fault. I say let them underestimate IDRA. The truth is that appears that IDRA is sitting in the catbird seat. Good luck to all. I like our team."
"Though it was short lived, the fireworks around here on Tuesday were significant.Let’s look at the numbers. The week started off strong, with a gain of 4.6% on a day when the sector struggled. But Tuesday, we got the thing that every drug development company so desperately needs: good trial news. Yes, it was just Phase I, and it was just a dozen or so patients, but the market noticed.It didn’t hurt that there was some sector tailwind. When the news hit, the stock traded as high as $2.55 on extremely high trading. The last time we saw that price level? November 7. Such heady levels could not last, but at week’s end, the stock had gained 22 cents or 12.7% to close at $1.95. For 2020, the stock is now positive by 7.14%.The broader market was mainly a large cap story. The NAS added another 3.42% to its recent gains. Its 2020 tally now stands at 9.38%, which is officially higher than the high-water mark for a weekly close of 8.45% from February 14. Amazing.The DOW led the gainers, surging an eye-popping 6.8%, and trimming its loss on the year from 11.1% to just 5%. BA must be mentioned here: it gained an amazing 40.1%, and closed over $200.00 per share for the first time since March 10. Caution: I saw a guy on CNBC yesterday talking about BA. His price target: $150.00.My bio indexes were mainly red, with one exception. The BTK was about mid-pack with a loss of 1.22%; the IBB took the Last Place ribbon, dropping 2.52%; the XBI tried a comeback Friday, but closed the week red by 0.64%. The (green) outlier was XLV, which closed the week with a gain of 0.19%. The volatility indicator, the VXX, took it on the chin again, tumbling 11.95% to close at $29.17. On 6/5/19, IDRA closed at $2.65. Though this is a worse comparison than last week, the stock’s impressive gain more than made up the difference. The YoY deficit shrunk from 32.4% to 26.4%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.73-1.85T 1.96-2.55W 1.98-2.13Th 1.86-2.02F 1.92-2.04 And from last week:M Memorial DayT 1.81-2.00W 1.75-1.89Th 1.73-1.80F 1.73-1.78Many people don’t manage their investments all that actively. I’d say most don’t. We’re busy with our lives, and who has time to watch the market? So we buy an S&P 500 Index Fund, and figure we’re probable safely ensconced in solid, safe returns.Not in 2020, IMO. Things are moving at a much faster pace than what’s typical. There are opportunities, but don’t blink.It’s truly a stock picker’s market. So let’s keep looking at individual stories.First, I’ll update the stocks I focused on last week. NVAX had a topsy-turvy week, gaining 14.73% on Monday, then losing 6.02% and 10.86% in the next two sessions. At week’s end, the stock had gained exactly 26 cents to close at $46.30 (0.56%). Need a heavy-duty seatbelt here.Last week’s other featured stock, CRDF, released news of promising results for its prospect Onvansertib, in KRAS- Mutated Metastic Colorectal Cancer. Yes, it was only Phase 1, and there were only 9 evaluable patients in one set, and 11 in another. But the ORR was 44%, which is 10 times better than the 4% we’re seeing with the current standard of care. That was good for a 21% gain on Monday, and another 10.7% on Tuesday. At week’s end, the stock was up 29.9%. This week’s focus is on two non-pharma stocks. I’ve held Sirius Satellite Radio (SIRI) off and on for a couple years. When COVID-19 came, it got hammered along with just about everything else. On April 3, it closed at $4.48 per share. Friday, just over a month later, it closed at $6.51. That’s 45.3% - not bad.I think I mentioned oil driller Helmerich and Payne (HP) when I was lamenting the fate of that industry a while back. On March 20, six weeks ago, it was down to $13.16 per share. Yesterday, it closed at $26.84, a cool 104% gain. I don’t have a position in HP; just shadow-boxing right now. While it’s nice to see the NAS snap ALL the way back and then some this spring, you’ll have to count me among the skeptics as to whether the good times will continue to roll without incident. Let’s put it this way: I’ve been adding to my VXX this week. If it goes down more next week, I’ll add more.Because there are more weird times ahead.Sarge"
"Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues, and you know it don’t come easy.Let’s look at the numbers. There isn’t really much of a story. Red 3 days out of 4; no loss higher than 2%. We played just well enough to lose. The stock closed down by 4 cents or 2.04% to close at $1.92. The gain since New Year’s stands at a still-slightly-encouraging 5.5%.The broader market had a generally red week, with the NAS continuing its recent mini-tailspin. The index lost 4.06%, and its gain on the year is now at 20.1% (down 10.2% from its high two weeks ago). The DOW was mid-pack with a loss of 1.66%. After going green again for 2020 two weeks ago, the venerable index has given some back. It’s back in the red again, by 3.06%.BA did not help. It lost 6.33%, and brought its 2020 loss to 50.8%. My bio indexes were red. The BTK set the tone with a loss of 1.69%; the IBB was down 1.15%; the XBI was the Least Stinky of the bunch, off 0.81%. The XLV was relatively unscathed, down 1.05%. The VXX has had a couple topsy turvy weeks! Last week it gained 13.1%; this week it lost 11.8%. Today, it stands at $25.52, six cents lower than it closed two weeks ago!On 9/12/19, IDRA closed at $3.00, which is 65 cents higher than the comparison from 2 weeks ago. The YoY loss has grown from 9.8% to 36% as a result.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M HOLIDAYT 1.90-2.00W 1.96-2.05Th 1.93-1.99F 1.92-1.99 And from last week:M 1.92-2.12T 2.00-2.13W 2.04-2.13Th 1.96-2.11F 1.95-2.09People talk about making money on Wall St. Companies get sold, and the investors gain 150% overnight. So quick!But it’s usually not an overnight story. While the results sometimes are dramatic in terms of their climax, the work to get there is often long, arduous, and tedious.I’ve been in IDRA for a few years now. In that time, it’s evolved in terms of its platforms and lead products. Today, with Tilso, I think the company has the best chance of a successful product it’s had in my time here.But, like with every drug in development, we get to wait for results. Coupled as always with the emotional roller coaster that comes with the wait.Right now, our stock is on a two-week losing streak. But in context, it’s been trading in a range since late July. It may go up next week, but it won’t go far, if the current pattern continues.It feels like treading water. Not getting anywhere.But this is what it takes. You do your DD. You establish your position. You monitor the investment, and if you keep your wits, you add to the position when the price is a bargain.But you hold your position. In spite of all the emotional misgivings. So you’ll BE in place, at the moment when it all comes to fruition.And you’ll be an overnight success. But we know better.SargeP.S.

"It’s story time, longs. Pull up a chair.First, let’s look at the numbers. IDRA regained its winning ways this week, rising 8 cents or 4.14%, to close at $2.01. The YTD score is still negative (we closed 2017 at $2.11). The margin is shrinking, now at 4.74%.The sector had a good week. The NAS, was green as seemingly always, rising 1.62%, and bringing its 2018 gain to 9.43%. My bio indicators were varying shades of green: the BTK rose 3.03%; the IBB was not quite as impressive, gaining 2.12%; the XBI was the star, surging up 3.92%. The XLV was less stellar, gaining 0.51%. On 6/1/17, IDRA closed at $1.68. The YOY comparison is now positive by 19.6%! Here are the daily ranges for the week:M HolidayT 1.88-1.95W 1.93-2.07Th 2.01-2.14 F 1.94-2.08And from last week:M 1.84-2.00T 1.86-1.94W 1.88-1.98Th 1.86-1.94 F 1.88-1.95Thursday, our friend tradingwithyourhead expressed some worries about the stock and how it’s being treated by Wall St. I think this is healthy and realistic. I'm going to tell you about AVNR.But it's lengthy. It will be posted as a reply to this message. Please tune in.Sarge"
"Last week, I called these the dog days for IDRA. This must be wildlife season, because this week, something smells fishy.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA made it two red weeks in a row, losing 6 cents or 2.2% to close at $2.67. For 2019, IDRA grew a slightly deeper shade of red. Compared to the share price of $2.77 on 12/31/18, the stock is down 3.61%. The market was mixed. The NAS had a solid week, surging 2.69%, and bringing its 2019 gain to 20.66%. My bio indicators all hovered around break-even, plus or minus: the BTK was up 0.59%; the IBB ended down by 0.32%; the XBI was in the “upper division”, up 0.52%. The XLV, usually a relative safe-haven, had the biggest loss at 1.16%. The DOW gave a little back this week, closing with a loss of 0.45%. The 2019 gain nudged down from 14.8% to 14.3%. On 6/21/18, IDRA closed at $10.17 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down to 73.7%. Yes, down. Yep, just a little depressing.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.66-2.78T 2.67-2.80W 2.55-2.72Th 2.54-2.73 F 2.60-2.75 And from last week:M 2.78-3.04T 2.88-3.02W 2.83-2.99Th 2.65-2.93 F 2.63-2.82Sometimes I think that Job had it tough, but then I also realize that Job did NOT suffer the indignities of investing in pharma development.Friday. It pretty much says it all. Coming into the day, the stock had been green Thursday by 2.33%. Not a stellar day, but we were grateful, as the stock had been red in six straight sessions before that.Friday the stock seemed to be building on that gain. Volume was a tad higher than usual, but that’s understandable, as it was the last day of the 2nd quarter. And the stock did pretty nicely, climbing to $2.75 at 3:50 p.m.If the stock had stayed at that price for just 10 more minutes, the stock would actually have ended the week green by a couple pennies. It would have been a small victory instead of two red weeks in a row.But it was not to be. At $2.75, the stock was up 11 cents on the day. But that was the pinnacle. The stock basically went down the rest of the session, closing with a gain of just 3 cents. The stock lost 2.9% in ten minutes.Strangest of all, in the last minute of trade, there was a transaction involving 1.5 MILLION shares. This, from a stock that has been averaging around 200,000 shares traded per session.And did that 1.5 million share trade move the stock price? Maybe downward a bit.It makes no sense, as to the how part. But we do know one thing: somebody who acquires shares in 7-figure batches decided to pony up yesterday. That’s almost surely institutional.We didn’t get any satisfaction yesterday. But maybe, in spite of the short-term appearance of injustice, it’s a sign that somebody in the industry took a big interest. Which may be a sign of good things to come.Sarge"
"IDRA set new 52-week highs every session this week. How’s that for a headline?Let’s look at the numbers! IDRA came into the week riding a 2-week green streak, which had netted a 21.4% gain. But we hadn’t seen anything yet.Tuesday, the stock had another one of the stellar days it has had of late. On huge volume, the stock never traded red all day, closing with a gain of 20.5%, and setting a 52-week trading high along the way. The next two days were more of the same, as the stock set trading and closing highs each day.Friday was a rather pedestrian day of consolidation. But the stock did end green by a penny, giving it a weekly gain of $1.42 (32.8%), to close at $5.95. After 3 weeks, the year’s gain is 61.2%!The broader market saw the return of the “FANG” stocks. The NAS was green every day, climbing 4.19%. Its gain on the new year is now 5.46%.The DOW was at the party, but hung out in the back yard, with a gain of 0.59%. BA had some big swings, ending up slightly better, by 0.74%. The year’s loss shrunk to 3.53%.My bio indexes were varying shades of green. The BTK led the pack with a gain of 2.31%; the IBB was second best, up 1.84%; the XBI was a distant third, gaining 0.55%. The XLV brought up the rear, nudging forward 0.53%. Supportive, but not a huge tail wind.The VXX was a victim of the overall market frivolity. It went back to its losing ways, losing 4.15% to close at $16.40..On January 22, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.94. The YoY comparison is now a gain of…206.7%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M MLK, Jr. HolidayT 4.55-5.85W 5.17-6.03Th 5.71-6.14F 5.69-6.00And from last week:M 4.10-4.38T 4.13-4.34W 4.02-4.30Th 4.12-4.39F 4.15-4.49I will take just a speck of credit for the end of the week. Because I fought back the urge to jinx us.Thursday night, I was feeling good. I decided to see how far the stock had come in the first 3 sessions. It came out to 32.6%! And I ALMOST posted it. But I thought it would be tempting fate.So I held off. Friday, the stock struggled all day – who could blame it? In the last hour, the stock still hovered around 5 cents to the red. Not a big deal. But it looked like the streak of consecutive 52-week highs would end.Then, my power went out (true story). I had to get my home ready for a dark evening, so I got busy. When the power came back on, I discovered the stock had rallied to turn green in the last few minutes. Wow. Icing on the cake.Where to now? I had to pull up a 3-year chart to see the last time IDRA closed over $6.00. Last time was Dec. 13, 2018, when the stock closed at $6.60 (split adjusted).So, it looks like there is another 10% or so to go before we hit resistance. And that resistance, after over 24 months, isn’t going to be that strong, IMO.All I know is, I’m happy. Let’s sing about it. And maybe dance a little, too. Here's Pharrell!Sargehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs"
"How high is your Beta?Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA could not extend its one-week winning streak. Though, for the record, the stock was still green on the week at the close of trade Thursday. But on Friday, all heck broke loose as IDRA lost over 9 percent in a day. In the end, the stock closed down 8.72% at $2.72. For 2019, IDRA is now back to a loss of 1.8%. The sector continued its see-saw pattern, only this week it felt more like a roller coaster. The NAS was doing fine until it fell 2.5% on Friday, which turned a positive week into a loss of 0.59%. The year’s gain for the index remains impressive at 15.2%. My bio indicators were just one big disaster: the BTK lost 3.8%; the IBB, not to be outdone, tumbled 5.28%; the XBI was relatively unscathed, losing 3.73%. The XLV was the best of a motley bunch, sliding 1.49%. The DOW continued to be dragged by Boeing, which was essentially the sole cause of a 1.34% loss. For 2019, the index is still up 9.32%. On 3/22/18, IDRA closed at $16.08 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now at 83.1%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.93-3.33T 2.82-3.19W 2.90-3.24Th 2.94-3.17 F 2.66-2.98And from last week:M 2.67-2.81T 2.68-2.81W 2.67-2.94Th 2.78-2.92 F 2.80-3.00I’ve said it before: the market loathes uncertainty. Friday, we got a good example.Rumors of a report coming out in DC led the market to start down Friday, and it stayed down. It got down right ugly, with a kind of exclamation point at the end of the day. A very negative exclamation point.And, as investors in pharma development, we got to experience the full effects of holding a “high beta” stock. What’s that? The definition is some blah-blah about volatility relative to the S&P 500, but the bottom line is, holding a high beta stock means you smile more broadly than others on days when the market is up, and that you have a personal cloud hanging over you when it’s down.And friends, guess what? This most likely is NOT the last day of uncertainty we’re going to have as time goes by and we see the repercussions of that report. So hang on. It’s gonna be a bumpy ride.In terms of IDRA’s chart, I will note that IDRA hit a recent closing high at $3.15 on Wednesday. And it hit a trading high of $3.33 on Monday. All that made me think swanky thoughts. Then the stock lost 4.76% on Thursday and 9.33% on Friday. Which got me thinking swampy thoughts.If this keeps going down, the closing low is $2.33 from January 23. The trading low, as I’ve mentioned before, is $2.25 from the next day. That’s our support. If the stock closes or trades more than a few pennies below those levels, get out your umbrella.Sarge"
"Here is a post of mine from a month ago...""I expect the next strong move up to take the stock over $6. 3 of the last bounces have been 82%, 42%, and 43%. A 40% bounce from here would take the stock right up to $6. I have a good deal of confidence that the stock price will be over $10 by the data release. Remember-----that sounds like a big move, but that is still just $1.25 presplit. Even at $1.50-$1.75 on a presplit basis the stock price would be $12-$14. Virtually no down side risk at this point.""I said it then and I'm reiterating it now---"
"Just the beginning of a new wave higher. The first wave took the stock from the doldrums around $2 into the $4's and woke investors up who had forgotten about IDRA(and I don't blame them) or thought it was on life support. This is the next wave up. We're really getting to crunch time. The time leading up to pivotal phase 3 data, especially the last few weeks is when there can be tremendous movement higher in a developmental stock. IDRA has never been this far along with previous data indicating that their drug is much more effective than the current standard of care. There is going to be continued upward pressure on the stock and increased volume. Even with whatever agenda the next administration may have toward drug pricing, Biden also has a very strong anti-cancer platform, which should outweigh any eventual price pressure. It also helps to be first to market, which IDRA will be as the only approved TLR-9 agonist, with Checkpoint still pretty far away. And that is just the tip of the iceberg with all of the other potential uses for tilso. Still shooting for at least $8-$9 by the data release."
"Solid presentation today. Milano seems energized and Horobin was clear and concise. (As a an aside, they addressed her retirement - Horobin will be the last person left in Boston, but she is going to continue advising and working (not day to day) on the Tilso program. Her husband is already retired. This explains things a bit more.)As for the presentation, the slides are a skinny version of the January JPM slide deck. In no particular order, here are my thoughts:1. Slide 6 is an updated version of the summary of results to date on the 204 program. It is identical to the version presented at JPM except that is now shows 3 CR’s instead of 2, for an overall CR rate of 8.8%. Note, there is an error on the slide because it should have reduced the PR count to 8 and lowered the PR percentage to 23.5% (to reflect that a person moved from PR to CR).2. Illuminate 204 – Data for all patients should be available by the end of the year. Likely will be presented at a medical conference, I am assuming sometime in Q4.3. Illuminate 301 – Up to 80 sites now and “well on our way” to enroll 300 patients by the end of 2019.4. When discussing “business development” Milano made an interesting statement. He said they were, “Trying to leverage another asset in the company.” I found this curious as it implied that they had an internal asset they were looking at trying to do something with. However, I asked Bob Doody about this and he clarified that “[Milano] was just referring to trying to bring in more assets.” 5. Another point that both Milano and Horobin made was the need to get “mature data” because interim data tends to under-report the response rate. This issue here, as has been discussed on this board by Tursta, Sarge and many others is that the mechanism of action is such that the longer you go after treatment the more opportunity Tilso has to do its thing. Along this same vein, Dr. Horobin specifically said that she felt the December data cut under-reported the response rate. She further stated that SD over time leads to an increase in Overall Survival (OS) which is one of the two endpoints for the Illuminate 301 study. Still further along these same lines, Dr. Horobin said that Ipi has a median response time of 12 weeks and that the first measurement in the 204 study was 8 weeks. This means that, on average, the first data readout on a patient in the 204 study might not even be seeing the combination effect from Ipi in addition to Tilso (this last sentence is my conclusion, not Dr. Horobin’s). Finally, Dr. Horobin added that this timing issue is why the Illuminate 301 trial is designed to have its first measurement at 12 weeks and not 8.6. IDRA has a self-imposed “moratorium” on updates to the 204 study. I think they got stung a little by “immature data” trickling out that also depressed their previous ORR number. I am not sure we will see another data cut on 204 until Q4.7. Both Milano and Dr. Horobin talked about the path for Tilso with the FDA. In particular they said that durability of response may very well be a differentiator between being able to get Accelerated Approval and having to wait for the OS data to come in on the phase 3. When asked how long is long enough, IDRA said that the FDA does not publish an exact threshold, but their best feeling was the FDA want better than 6-month improvement in OS, but it was not clear to me whether this was to support AA or simply to support approval.8. Finally, Milano also indicated that he thought they would have one or both of the new trials (head and neck and CRC) operational by the end of Q2. Dr. Horobin added that she very much felt that Tilso had applications far beyond melanoma and she seem particularly excited about the MSS-CRC trial, although she did not go into detail.I hope that helps."
"Happy New Year, everyone! May 2021 be a little less stressful for us all.Let’s look at the numbers. Short story: thin trading and a weak sector conspired against IDRA, which had no news to stem the tide. The stock was red 3 of 4 sessions, and closed the week down 57 cents (13.4%) at $3.69. For the year, the final tally is a gain of 102.7%. The broader market was lackluster. The NAS tacked another 0.29%, to its gain on the year, which ends at…43.1%. One for the record books!The DOW was green, but also without fanfare, gaining 0.69%. The calendar year gain came to a final tally of 6.55%.BA made it 4 red weeks in a row, sliding 1.73%. On the year, it lost 34.5%.My bio indexes were not any help. After 2 nice weeks, the BTK gave back 3.72%; the IBB was not quite as bad, down 3.6%; the XBI, per its pattern of exaggerating everything, lost 5.94%. The XLV was the only player to close green, up 0.81%. (BTW, the XBI had many more green weeks than red this year, as it carded a gain of 48.04%!)The VXX was red for a third straight week, sliding 15 cents or 0.89% to close at $16.73.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.05-4.40T 3.76-4.15W 3.81-4.16Th 3.63-4.17F New Year’s DayAnd from last week:M 4.05-4.44T 4.14-4.67W 4.18-4.48Th 4.21-4.40F ChristmasA 3-handle. How I long for the verdant pastures of Quad Country.Actually, I’m not worried about Idera. I don’t think the market has come to appreciate the value in Tilso yet.So, what does Tilso do? It enhances the ability of other, targeted cancer treatments to do their job. It helps those medicines “find” tumors in the body. And it helps treat the tumors as well. AND it has a benign safety profile.It’s going to succeed. It’s just a matter of time until trial results come out. This time with a 3-handle? It’s a rare buying opportunity. If it’s still in this range next week, I’m adding.The market is just one big head game. The big funds don’t jump in and out of positions quickly. They play the long game. And I’m sure there’s a significant amount of hedging that allows them to take advantage of fluctuations.But once a fund has done its DD and establishes a position, it will most often stick with a stock until it plays out, one way or the other. Because that’s where the real money is made, not flitting in and out of positions.So stick with it, my long friends. We have a winner here. Don’t let anybody talk you out of your shares.Sarge"
"For those who might not have read, IDRA just filed and 8K disclosing the compensation for the 5 major members of the Executive Team (CEO, CFO, General Counsel, SVP-Biz Dev, and Chief Scientific Officer). They also disclosed a new pay structure for the CEO. Here are the highlights:- No raises for anyone except the CFO. I suspect the only reason the CFO's comp was adjusted was that he started midway through 2019; - They were each awarded stock options, which give them the right to buy IDRA shares in the future at $1.79 per share (the exercise price). These options vest 25% per year over a 4 year period, so the first quarter vests on January 10, 2020; - They were also each awarded restricted stock units (""RSU""). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of IDRA on the date it vests. Again, the vesting schedule is 25% per year over 4 years. What is important to recognize about RSUs is that they each represent the right to receive one share of stock. There is no exercise price. So 1000 RSUs gives the recipient the right to receive 1000 shares of stock. Contrast this to options - 1000 options with an exercise price of $1.79 gives the recipient the right to buy 1000 shares of stock for $1.79. If, at the time of exercise, the stock has a value of $11.79 then the recipient has the right to make a $10,000 profit ($11.79-$1.79 x 1000). On the other hand if the share price is less than the exercise price, the option is worthless;- Additionally, Vin Milano (CEO) had his employment agree altered. For the first 10 days of 2020 he was paid in cash. From January 10 through the end of 2020 he will be paid $6600 in cash and an award of RSUs on December 18, 2020. The total of these three add up to his $600,000 base salary;- They all received annual bonuses as well.From my perspective there are really two interesting things here. First, the base comp is going to be flat for everyone except the CFO vs. last year. Second, Milano is pretty much giving up cash comp in exchange for stock. There are several ways to read all of this. First, I think the lack of salary increases is a symbolic belt-tightening at IDRA. The amounts are immaterial, but the C-suite not getting raises sends a signal that they are trying to conserve cash. Yes, they could also terminate folks and save a lot more, but that sends a very different signal (and they also just did that last year). Second is Milano's salary. This move saves almost 600K in cash over the year but, more importantly, it seems to be an effort to very closely align Milano's comp to stock performance. It is interesting that the describe this as: ""and $575,218.16 shall be payable in the form of a restricted stock unit grant to be granted to Mr. Milano on December 18, 2020 (the “RSU Award”)"".As I noted above, RSUs represent a number of shares, not a dollar value. It is not clear to me from the info available how the December 18 RSU grant will converted to shares. Is it $575,218 worth of shares on December 18, 2020 or is it $575,218 worth of shares based on the current PPS, to be granted on December 18? The latter would very much align is comp to the share price appreciation while the for is more akin to simply conserving cash and paying him in stock (yes, diluting you and me to pay Milano). I suspect the grant of RSUs is made now and based on the current share price (i.e. $575,218/$1.79 would be a grant of 321.350 RSUs which he could convert to the same number of shares on December 18), but I cannot be sure since the blanks in the form are not filled in.Draw your own conclusions about what this all means, and good luck to you."
"Currently there are 35 million shares in the float. I see a market cap of at least $500 million leading into the P3 data release in the first half of 2021. That translates to a share price of nearly $15. Of course, that also is just under $2 pre-split---which is a shame. But from here it will certainly be a nice gain, and with all of the theoretical uses for tilso yet to be determined the stock should rise much higher than that level. Milano took Viropharma from $2 to a buyout price of $50. That is definitely possible with IDRA, and once you get your first drug approval---especially in the cancer arena, that is more effective than the current SOC and could be a ""game changer"" in cancer therapy-----anything can happen."
"continued....5. If management is confident in the likelihood of long term value to current shareholders, why have they not bought shares on the open market to reassure shareholders?I can’t speak for anyone’s personal decisions. I also am not a named officer of the company so anything that I do would not show up in a Form 4 filing. I can tell you that I buy the stock with every pay check through the company’s employee stock purchase program. I’ve participated in this since the day I joined the company. I can confirm for you right now though we are in the standard end of quarter blackout. This blackout period occurs every quarter and runs from 2 weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter and is lifted 48 hours after the 10Q is filed. Robert DoodyThat's it....I'm awaiting responses. I've been here for 4 years with nothing to show for it and my wife is not happy! I believe in the science and so I will continue to stay."
Happy Thanksgiving mb friends
"I emailed Robert Doody asking him a few pointed questions particularly on why the continued beat down and whether there is any light for long suffering longs at the end of the tunnel. As usual, he is prompt and courteous and shared what he can. There is a reason he is probably the best at what he does. I asked if I could share his comments and he said yes. (BTW Gold as far as I can tell anyone can access IR....you do have internet service don't you?)Dr. XXXXXThank you for the email and for your continued support for the company. I also am a shareholder as I have been purchasing shares since the day I joined the company, so I assure you I am just as frustrated by how the stock has performed. As for the other programs that you mentioned, the simple truth was that they just didn’t work well enough or in some cases at all. That fact simply exists in drug development. I feel that we are fortunate though that we do have tilsotolimod, which appears so far to be working and making a difference in the lives of cancer patients through the 204 and 101 trials. Ultimately the 301 trial will be the definitive answer. As it relates to the stock price and investor interest the unfortunate situation right now is that institutional investors right now are choosing to remain on the sidelines for companies in I/O that so far only have data from single arm trials. The outcomes from IDO and NKTR and the Sting agonists has created this environment. They’ve taken the position that they would rather have a definitive answer with less risk knowing that they will likely pay more when that time comes.The one area I’ve observed where that has changed for a handful of companies is when they’ve demonstrated efficacy in an additional tumor. IOVANCE is an example of this.So as that pertains to us, we have an opportunity to potentially do that with 206 in the first half of next year.Robert"
"This is whatcha call “bumping along the bottom”.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA made it two red weeks in a row. The damage wasn’t AS bad this week. But it was still nowhere close to good. When the dust settled, in spite of a supportive sector, IDRA lost 17 cents or 6.25% to close at $2.55. For 2019, IDRA has dug further into negative territory; the loss is now 7.94%. The sector was very supportive. The NAS went back to its winning ways with a gain of 1.13%. For 2019, the tally is now green by 16.48% - not bad work for one quarter. My bio indicators were all good: the BTK was the leader, surging 3.57%; the IBB was close behind, rising 3.35%; the XBI could only “show” (third place in horse racing), up 3.05%. The XLV was a relative laggard, but still gained 1.25%. The DOW finally began to shake off a two-week case of the Boeing flu, going green by 1.13%. For 2019, the index is now up 11.15%. Again, not bad for one quarter. On 3/22/18, IDRA closed at $14.72 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss “improved” from 83.1% to 82.6%. Yippee.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.55-2.72T 2.55-2.71W 2.50-2.65Th 2.50-2.64 F 2.51-2.66And from last week:M 2.93-3.33T 2.82-3.19W 2.90-3.24Th 2.94-3.17 F 2.66-2.98Woof. These are the “dog days” for IDRA. Just not a lot of glamour.The saddest day this week was Monday. The whole market was in neutral. Meanwhile, IDRA decided to throw the car into reverse and floor it. Down 4% in a day, and on below average volume to top it off. I don’t get it. IDRA, as a stock, is vulnerable right now. Since the RS, the volume is surprisingly low. To my observation, the average is around 300,000 per day. That’s the kind of volume that can allow a bear to “paint the tape” with a 100-share trade at 3:59.The reason for the low volume is that IDRA has no product, and no guarantee its only potential product will be approved. So, no income. Just trial results. And the last results were greeted by a giant raspberry from the market.Is Tilso the real thing? Longs have their chips on the table.The market is far from welcoming to individual investors. Preying on frustration, the professionals weave their webs of misdirection. It’s not easy to keep your head when there’s no news about your company in what seems like forever, and when you do get news, it’s bad. Or worse, it’s good but it’s treated as bad.The Tutes have to get on board. That’s reality, and that takes time. Our job is to hold on.Because as time goes by, the percentage of outstanding shares owned by institutions will get higher, which means that many more individuals threw their hands up and sold….probably at a low price.The pros…they play the long game. Even if 4 or 5 years pass before the big buyout, 400% is still a pretty fair profit. They buy and hold, watch and wait.We’re going to get an update to the “profoundly disappointing” results we experienced in December. Is time going to be on our side? Will Tilso’s delayed reaction create a fairly perfect storm that propels us back to pre-December levels?I’m not ruling it out. Sarge"
"This phase 3 drug has peak sales of $500-$700M. If we get a positive trial readout in Q1, doesn't that put the stock at $30? Sure seems like it to me, buying all I can"
"It looks like the P3 data will now be coming in March---""late this quarter"" according to Milano. This quarter is going to move very quickly. I'm sure there will be traders that try to play the stock short term, but the downside risk is minimal to nonexistent, except for minor day to day fluctuation. The trend will be up leading into the data. This is as optimistic as the company has both sounded---and acted in years. Bringing in the new COO is about as much of a tell as you can get with upcoming results expected soon. And the fact that the first thing he did was sink his own money into the purchase of 18000 shares was another strong indication of what we should expect. The stock will rise to a new high in the next few weeks and likely hover there until the PR comes. With good data I expect the MC to reach between $500-$600 million, which will be a stock price between $13-$16. The better the data the higher the price, and of course with better than expected data, even $20 could be reached."
"IDRA had a good week, in more than one way.Let’s look at the numbers. As of Tuesday’s close, IDRA had not distinguished itself, gaining just a penny while the market had raced out of the gate. But after the bell rang, the company announced a PP that would put over $20 million into the bank.For once, there was frenetic AH activity. IDRA hit $1.60, a level it hadn’t seen since March 9. There was dramatic follow-up on Wednesday, when volume was about 8 times recent levels and the stock traded as high as $1.71. After giving back 3 pennies on Friday, the stock ended the short week gaining 20 cents or 16.3% to close at $1.43.The broader market repeated its stellar gains of two weeks ago. The NAS surged 10.58%. It’s 2020 loss fell from 17.8% to 9.13%. (While that is great, remember that on Valentine’s Day, less than 2 months ago, this index was up 8.45% on the year. This market has taken a beating since then, and it has not yet recovered).The DOW was a leader again, which is getting more common these days. It was an impressive victory, with the venerable index rocketed forward 12.67% on the week. 2020 is still red though, by 16.9%. My bio indexes showed impressively again. The BTK was up 7.33%, which was by no means the best; the IBB was almost that good, gaining 7.27%; the XBI took the Index Cup, up 11.45%. The relatively conservative XLV was not outdone by much, up 9.28%. The volatility index, the VXX, was red for a third week in a row. After closing at $45.45 last week, the ETN lost 8.54% to close at $41.57. Boeing (BA), my poster child for this volatile era, led the Dow’s charge with a gain of 21.9% to close at $151.84. On 4/10/19, IDRA closed at $2.80. The YoY loss managed to shrink from 55.8% to 48.9%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.23-1.31T 1.22-1.37W 1.38-1.71Th 1.39-1.51F Market Closed And from last week:M 1.36-1.47T 1.21-1.44W 1.25-1.32Th 1.25-1.32F 1.18-1.29 While the market loathes uncertainty, it has a special distaste for monetary uncertainty. With its PP this week, IDRA gave itself some financial security at a crucial time.The timing was nice, too, as smaller cap pharma companies had a good day Wednesday (the IBB was up 3.1%, while the XBI was up 3.93). Doesn’t hurt.For me, the volume Wednesday was very encouraging. Who knows? The next time the market goes down (probably sooner than later), maybe the stock won’t get a 0-handle. They are so undignified, after all.I haven’t done a song in a while. But this week, @Nysigi’s candid explanation of his situation inspired me. Here’s an old fave from Stealer’s Wheel. Hang in there, my friend. There are better days ahead.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMAIsqvTh7gSarge"
"I suspect this bump may be related to the Bakers. Specifically, today it was announced that Kodiak Sciences is receiving a $225 million capital injection from the Baker Brothers Advisors. In exchange, the BB are not getting equity, but rather a royalty on Kodiak's drug for macular degeneration. The royalty is 4.5% of net sales and is capped at $1 billion. In addition, the Bakers are committing $25 million to Kodiak's next financing round. The Bakers own 25% of Kodiak. Kodiak is up about 65% today.I suspect the move today may be, at least in part, in sympathy with the Kodiak move. Having said that,KOD and IDRA are the only stocks that I track where the BB are the largest investor this is up significantly today. I could be completely off base, but the coincidence is pretty strong. Good luck my long suffering friends."
"So this is really interesting today. As I write this the PPS is at $3.76, which is remarkable in and of itself in that it is just over a 22% gain from yesterday's close. However, what is more remarkable, or one heck of a coincidence, is that 3.76 is precisely the level at which the Bakers exercised 2.5 million warrants. In other words, yesterday it was reported that the Bakers paid $3.76 for their shares and today the market takes the PPS up to that precise level - at least on an intraday basis.Honestly, there is nothing in the 10K that supports this sort of move except for this little nugget about the Baker's warrants, so maybe that is a much-needed vote of confidence. Put another way, how would the stock react if Vin Milano had purchased 2.5 million shares at a $3.76? It seems the market is viewing this warrant conversion as a very substantial insider purchase at an above-market price, either of which alone are bullish but together are very bullish.I still think this feels like someone is establishing or adding to a position which means it likely will give back a fair amount of this gain, but it sure fun now. Good luck folks."
"So far I have been pretty spot on over the last 2-3 months. According to my calculations the stock will remain at this level +/- 20-25 cents until the next buying wave kicks in. There should be minimal to no downside movement and there is very little profit to be made in day trading here, unless you are looking for 10-15 cents and quick flips. With the recent strength and the stock remaining in the $6 range, despite a few tries to take it lower, while I don't see the next move up being as large percentagewise as the previous moves, which were averaging 30-40% from valley to peak, I do see the next plateau being established in the $7-$7.25 range. That could occur in anywhere from a week or so, putting that in the beginning of February, to 3-4 weeks, in the middle to end of the month. The data will likely be revealed in the middle to end of March and I still see the stock price anywhere from $8-$10 by the time the data is released. Still only 60-70% of where I think the MC should be. The middle of March is only 7 weeks away. First TLR-9 agonist to reach this stage and a very large lead over the possible competition--solid positive trial results in earlier trials where the trial population was allowed to be less selective than the larger P3 cohort which should lead to better outcomes. I think the efficacy of yervoy or keytruda with tilso has to be significantly better than with either alone. That's what we are betting on. The impact of that will be to take another major step towards treating, taming, controlling, and someday being able to tell patients who are diagnosed with cancer----""don't worry, we have new treatments for your form of cancer now that should take care of it in just a few months."" As I have said, the crescendo is building."
"My wife was briefly in an IMO-2125 trial. It was her last option, but it came too late to save her life. However, within 8 weeks of starting the trial, the targeted tumor almost completely vanished. IMO-2125 was having amazing effects, but her cancer just had too much of a head start. I am thoroughly convinced that IMO-2125 will be a complete game changer when, not if, it gets FDA approval. That's why I'm buying as many Idera shares I can afford..."
"“In 2021, we expect to embark on our change from a development-stage company to a commercial company. In anticipation of that, I am delighted that we will be adding Dan’s extensive expertise and leadership to our Idera team,” stated Mr. Milano. “Dan’s leadership of our marketing, sales, manufacturing, and distribution strategy and operations will be invaluable to us on our journey to bring tilsotolimod to patients in need.”"
"Here are my 2 scenarios----BOTH of which result in significant increases in stock price:1) The vote passes and the companies merge. IDRA immediately goes up about 50% based on the stock price of BCRX value of the new company. Even if the price of BCRX drops $1---IDRA would still rise to about $1.75-----unless I have this ratio thing all wrong2) the merger vote fails---- it won't fail from IDRA's side. IDRA would receive a $6 MILLION payment from BCRX as per the agreement. IDRA was trading at twice it's current level prior to the merger announcement----and that was BEFORE the stellar news was released. There was also a reverse split in the works, but the stock was still rising. The 2125 P3 trial is now almost ready to begin collecting data due to the rapid 14 week trial period. The trial will enroll quickly and new trials will begion with 2125----and IDRA DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM thanks to Pillar. They also don't have to pay BMY for ipi. IDRA should regain much of the value it lost should the merger be voted down. Comments accepted..."
"IDRA made some real strides this week. Why doesn’t it feel like it?Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA went green for the second week in a row, this time to the tune of a 7.54% gain. The closing price was $2.85, which is, to be blunt, rather daringly close to a swanky 3-handle. Which the stock closed above, just the day before. For 2019, IDRA has officially dragged itself into Respectability City, with a GAIN of 4.33%. Yes, take a breath my friends. A breath of air not tainted by that awful red smell.The sector was not much help this week, in spite of the continued success of the broader market. The NAS gained 0.74%, bringing its 2019 gain up to 13.45%. My bio indicators, meanwhile, were red 3 out of 4 days: the BTK slid 1.44%; the IBB lost 1.18%; the XBI was only slightly better, down 0.98%. The XLV was relatively unscathed, off by 0.32%. The DOW continued its winning ways of 2019, up 0.57%. On the year, the gain is now 11.6%. This makes (I believe) 9 green weeks in a row for the benchmark index.On 2/22/18, IDRA closed at $14.72 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down two percent to 80.6%. Somehow, this is an improvement. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M President’s DayT 2.52-2.67W 2.58-2.72Th 2.59-3.09 F 2.73-3.15And from last week:M 2.40-2.65T 2.46-2.70W 2.70-2.86Th 2.61-2.80 F 2.61-2.73IDRA bucked the market practically all week. With the exception of Tuesday, when it was red just like its sector, every time IDRA went up, the sector went down, and vice versa.So, Wednesday and Thursday, when the sector was flailing, IDRA was doing quite well, actually gaining 14% on over triple the daily average volume on Thursday (this was due to a buyout of a comparable company by Merck – I don’t care, I’ll take it!).Then Friday, when the sector had some pretty impressive gains, IDRA plunged over 5%. But not before it set a trading high of $3.15, eclipsing the $3.09 it had reached the day before. But it didn’t feel like a celebration, considering the stock went red a little after 10:00.While I’m thinking of it, you may want to look at the daily ranges for this week. Every day, both the low and the high got higher. Strong week!Of course, we could pull back from here. No, I’m not trying to go all doom and gloom, but when a stock makes some progress, sometimes there’s a pullback. We just have to remember that it’s a pause on the way UP.There is value here. Longs know it, so much that we wouldn’t be satisfied with a buyout even at 5 times today’s market cap, because we know that market cap is deceivingly low. I asked this yesterday: is there a poison pill in place? This is not Vin’s first rodeo, so I assume he has protections in place.So, IF there’s a pullback, hold on, and add if you can at bargain prices. They will NOT be here long.I can’t end this without some Johnny Nash.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkwJ-g0iJ6wSarge"
"While Wall Street seems pretty unaware of IDRA, that doesn't appear to be the case in the medical oncology arena. Did a quick google search a few minutes ago and saw a few things that were interesting. One was a tweet on the twitter account of the Head Melanoma Physician at the Cleveland clinic highlighting the "" impressive"" , (his words), ASCO results. More interesting was a panel symposium from a few days ago entitled "" T cell exhaustion : Can we overcome it in cancer "". Top experts. 2125 and other approachs presented. ( Inhibitors and reactivators ) 2125 one of the more promising approachs featured."
"FYI-----The stock has hit new peak highs 3 times since 11/4. The interval from peak to peak---with drops of at least 20-25% in between each peak high, was 16 days, 13 days, and 13 days. each subsequent high was above the previous one. The current interval from the last peak is now 13 days. Patterns are always useful and valuable in stock analysis, especially in a situation like IDRA, with the most critical news release coming very soon. Stochastics are also indicating extremely oversold conditions, with the readings at 20 for the 10 day and an anemic 14 for the 6 month. All indicating the stock will turn positive. If you look at these drops as a buying opportunity----now is definitely your chance to capitalize. Just like this entire year, we're all trying to make lemonade."
"Hey Gary. Please note S's link to the Novartis purchase of AveXis. Also, please take note that the Baker Bros. Advisors own 775,000 shares of AveXis, having started their position in Q4 of 2016 with 315,000 shares and added again in Q1, Q2 and Q3 2017. I am sure you will find some way to find the gray cloud in that silver lining too, but the fact is that the BB know what they are doing. It certainly does not always work out, but there is a reason folks pay attention to them."
"IDRA continued its tendency to perform well on Fridays yesterday. That’s a good trait.Let’s look at the numbers. After starting the year with a stellar gain of 15.99%, I wondered if IDRA could keep up the momentum. By Thursday evening, the stock had been green 2 sessions and red 2 as well. The stock was up 5 cents (1.17%), but Options Friday loomed.The day didn’t start well, as the stock traded to its session low ($4.15) around 10:30. But from that point, the stock pretty much climbed the rest of the day, ending with a gain of 15 cents on the day and 20 cents (4.67%) on the week to close at $4.48. After 2 weeks, the year’s gain is 21.4%!The broader market struggled amidst a nation in turmoil. The NAS gave back about half of its gains from last week, down 1.54%. The gain on the new year shrunk to 1.22%.The DOW also struggled, down 0.91% on the week. Blame BA, which is still answering questions about a crash in Indonesia last week. It went red for the second time in a row, this time by 2.66%. The young year’s loss stands at 4.25%.My bio indexes, with one exception, actually managed a second straight green week (though not as spectacular as last week). The BTK gained 1.06%; the IBB was the leader of an average pack, up 2.2%; the XBI got to play second fiddle, gaining 1.48%. The XLV was the only attendee in the red, sliding 0.36%. So small caps may have had the upper hand this week.The VXX reflected the turmoil around the country, and this case it means it was saying “yippee”. After 4 red weeks in a row, it scored a gain of 4.65% to close at $17.11..On January 15, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.89. The YoY comparison therefore is a gaudy gain of 137%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.10-4.38T 4.13-4.34W 4.02-4.30Th 4.12-4.39F 4.15-4.49And from last week:M 3.52-4.02T 3.90-4.13W 3.88-4.04Th 4.00-4.13F 4.02-4.40Before we longs start puffing out our chests, we need to acknowledge that this year’s gains are due in large part to the stock’s lousy performance at the end of December. As some commented here at the time, the stock was simply oversold.That being said, it WAS options expiration day Friday, and some of my stocks, especially CRDF, got their hats handed to them. Somehow, IDRA came out unscathed.Why? Value. IDRA has a promising, effective cancer drug in trials, and its market cap is well under $200 million (Yahoo has it at $170 million; E-Trade has it at $158 million).And, updated trial results are in sight. The company says in the first quarter. I’m assuming that means March, probably late in the month. But that’s coming up fast.Now, the aforementioned CRDF, which lost over 31% yesterday, did release an update on a trial for its primary drug in trials yesterday morning. The results were VERY similar to results that led the stock to skyrocket last fall, but yesterday, the market decided to pounce.At $475 million, CDRF’s market cap is well over twice IDRA’s even after yesterday’s plunge. It may well have been due for a trim, and I’m certain options expiration was in the mix.There are absolutely no guarantees on Wall St. No such thing as a sure thing. But looking at the chart, it looks like IDRA has gotten a decent sized correction out of its system, and is looking to take a run at a 5-handle in the foreseeable future.I like the way the stock is acting. We’ll see if I’m right. The numbers will tell the story.Sarge"

"It’s been a series of higher highs for IDRA this week. Hasn’t it been great?Let’s sprint to the numbers. After gaining 21.1% last week, IDRA picked up right where it left off, going green the first 4 sessions this week, including gains of at least 6% on Monday and Weds. Even after giving back 3.95% on Friday, the stock gained 41 cents (14.9%) to close the week at $3.16. For the calendar year, the stock is now up an eye-popping 73.6%.The broader market was most supportive. After 2 red weeks in a row, the NAS came back with a vengeance as it surged 9.01%. This was interesting with the national election in the backdrop; perhaps the notion of a divided government gave the market some relief. The stock’s gain on the year climbed to 32.6%, close to its all-time high. The DOW led the market surge Monday, and competed the rest of the week, closing with a gain of 6.87%. The calendar year deficit shrunk from 7.13% to 0.75%. BA was a strong supporter of the DOW, up 9.25%. For the year, its loss improved from 55.7% to 51.6%.My bio indexes all had great weeks. The BTK’s gain of 5.15% would have been impressive almost any other week; the IBB climbed 5.45%; the XBI was even better, up 6.3%. The XLV managed a gain on Monday when everyone else was red, and ended the week up 8.12%. As the market surged, the VXX took one to the chin. After gaining 19.67% last week, it gave back 22.7% this week, closing at $20.52.On 11/6/19, IDRA closed at $2.52. That’s 18 cents less than last week’s comparison. Combined with this week’s leap forward, the YoY comparison is now green by 25.4%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.72-2.97T 2.90-3.14W 3.00-3.47Th 3.19-3.39F 3.12-3.36 And from last week:M 2.16-2.39T 2.33-2.60W 2.43-2.75Th 2.69-3.14F 2.51-2.90This is really fun, watching our stock knock out 52-week highs day after day. The closing price set a high of $2.93 last week, only to be eclipsed on Tuesday ($3.00), Wednesday ($3.18), and Thursday ($3.29).In the meantime, the stock equaled the 52-week trading high it set on 10/29 ($3.14) on Tuesday, and set a much higher bar at $3.47 the next day.Volume has continued to be high. While Monday was right around recent averages, volume surged Tuesday and Weds. to around twice recent levels. Friday, when the stock gave back a bit, it was back down to average levels.I do believe it’s a market cap thing, as @Paolo pointed out yesterday. The fact is that Tilso is looking like it will be part of a combination first line treatment for more than one type of tumor, and where is the market cap? $111 million.Million? Sorry, but cancer drugs that work generally put a stock’s market cap into numbers that begin with “B”. So…if that market cap gets to just $1B, we’re looking at almost a tenfold increase in stock price.Bottom line: I don’t think the past weeks have been an aberration. Rather, they are a prelude.It won’t be linear progress, of course. No, that would be too easy. There will be setbacks, but those will be more like feints for investors in doubt, the classic shaking of the tree.No, I think we’ll be seeing more 52-week highs for the rest of this year and well into the next. Fasten your seat belts.Sarge"
"That was rather satisfying, wasn’t it?Let’s get right to the numbers. IDRA broke through this week, finally escaping a trading range it has been in for weeks. Monday set the tone. While the market was generally tanking, the home team here gained 3.52% on high volume. It was a sign of things to come.The next 3 days were all ""high-5’s"", as the stock gained almost 9% twice, on very high volume. Even after giving back 6.14% in Friday’s session, the stock closed up 48 cents (21.1%) to close at $2.75. For the year, the stock is now up an impressive 51.1%.The broader market, by contrast, was basically a train wreck. The NAS made it 2 red weeks in a row, this time with feeling, as it dropped 5.5%. (Surprisingly, one of the big culprits was AAPL!) Its gain on the year dipped to 21.6%, which is still better than a poke in the nose. The DOW, not one to back down from a challenge, did it even better (worse), losing 6.47%. This put it solidly back in the red for the year, by 7.13%. BA was another driver of the DOW’s miseries, losing $22.97 (13.7%) to close at $144.39. For the year, its loss jumped from 48.6% to55.7%.My bio indexes were almost as bad. The BTK lost 3.02%; the IBB did worse, down 4.3%; the XBI was in the middle of the crowd, down 4.13%. The XLV came in last, plunging 5.7%. For once, the VXX got some respect. It gained 19.67% to close at $26.53.On 10/31/19, IDRA closed at $2.70. That’s a penny better than last week’s comparison. Given this week’s huge gain, the YoY tally turned from a loss of 16% to a gain of 1.85%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.16-2.39T 2.33-2.60W 2.43-2.75Th 2.69-3.14F 2.51-2.90 And from last week:M 2.15-2.27T 2.11-2.30W 2.04-2.17Th 2.10-2.17F 2.13-2.28As I commented here Thursday night, IDRA set new 52-week highs for closing price ($2.93) and trading ($3.14) that day. The last time this stock traded over $3 was almost 13 months ago, on 10/1/19. We can now officially say the stock is trending higher.In addition to overcoming some serious sector and market headwinds, the stock’s performance was more impressive due to the volume, which was five times its recent levels on Thursday. On NO news!Here’s the thing: when a stock has volume of over 500,000 shares (which IDRA did twice this week) one thing is clear: it’s not individual investors driving the trading. It’s institutions. I talk about tea leaves. This is a big one, and it’s fairly obvious. Now, do we private shareholders get to find out exactly who was doing all the buying here? Of course we do! Right at the end of January.Because that’s the deadline for institutions to report their positions as of the end of the 4th quarter. Now, who’s going to remember to take notice of who increased positions 3 months from now?I nominate @Brian. You’re welcome.In the meantime, even if the stock submits to downward market momentum next week or the week after, we’ve had this week. And this week, we’ve had Validation. There is value here, and the professionals are noticing.Sarge"
"Attached is my original correspondence with Bob Doody in 2018... for some clarity on 3GA.. as well as insight on Tilso and the BCRX proposed merger.. interesting for BCRX shareholders as myself..Jeff, You are a very loyal retail long shareholder. I’m sorry that you ended up in a position feeling like a gut punch. I don’t think you care too much, but we all feel that way too. We tried to make an aggressive play to merge with another company to strengthen ours and diversify. Unfortunately, there were enough influential shareholders that believe BioCryst is going to be a takeout candidate for 12X their current market cap in less than 12 months and they didn’t want to be diluted ahead of that. These were mostly new shareholders of BCRX since the fall and I don’t think they had any idea that was the investment thesis these players had. And they were so determined to kill this that a number of them doubled and tripled their positions in BCRX to kill this deal. We took a shot. However, the merger was Plan B. Plan A was to develop 2125 and bring it to market. Plan A has never wavered. We now are contemplating how rapidly we can begin moving 2125 into more solid tumors and have had advisory board meetings with key immunology opinion leaders just in the last 2 weeks to further formulate that strategy. As to IMO-8400, unfortunately the drug just didn’t work. It did absolutely nothing compared to placebo. And while we are at it, the first target we picked out of the 3GA didn’t show much either. This is the nature of this business. We are a very small biotech company like many others, trying to move forward the things that do work and have promise and at the same time keep the lights on from data update to data update. I don’t think I need to issue a press release to tell you the following things: We have three ongoing clinical trials: ILLUMINATE 101 – Monotherapy trial of tilsotolimod studying various different tumor types and dose finding. (We are now enrolling the high dose of 32mg) ILLUMINATE 204 – Phase 2 Trial of tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma (60 patients, 10 sites) (last data update was at ASCO. Next is likely ESMO) – expect to complete enrollment of the full 60 by year end and have data from the complete trial by mid-year 2019. ILLUMINATE 301 – Registration Phase 3 trial of tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab monotherapy in PD-1 refractory melanoma. (300 patients enrollment target, 80 sites worldwide). Trial initiated late Q1 2018. We are now planning strategy around expanding our tilsotolimod into several additional tumor types. Once again, I am terribly sorry that you feel let down. Bob"
"IDRA was just 35 minutes from a green week. But I’m still feelin’ all right (cue Joe Cocker).Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA again fell short in its bid to end its losing streak. The stock needed a great Friday to close green, and it did seem to have a shot for a while (see below). But in the end, the stock price lost another 4 cents to close at $1.59, a loss of 2.45%.After looking almost bearish just two reports ago, the broader market made it 2 green weeks in a row. Old Reliable is now Old Impressive. It gained 2.21% on the week, and is now up 8.45% for 2020. Which would be impressive if this were August. As it is, IT’S THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. The market has apparently decided it can defy gravity. The DOW also continued to plug along, up 1.01%. Its 2020 gain is up to 3.01%. Also quite a pace!My bio indexes were green, but not as spectacularly as last week: the BTK led the way with a gain of 2.93%; the IBB was the petulant stepchild, rising a modest 0.77; the XBI had a decent week, climbing 1.86%. The XLV scored a “show”, up 0.86%. The VXX, as it is designed, lagged as much as the market charged. All things being relative, the loss was 5.98%, almost exactly half of the 11.2% it lost last week.On 2/14/19, IDRA closed at $2.61. The YoY loss has risen from 37.3% to 39.1%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.56-1.65T 1.57-1.68W 1.59-1.65Th 1.46*-1.60 (52-week low = $1.45)F 1.52-1.65 And from last week:M 1.58-1.69T 1.57-1.65W 1.63-1.73Th 1.63-1.69 F 1.60-1.68 At 3:25 Friday afternoon, IDRA traded at $1.64. If it had held that level, the stock would have gained a penny on the week, and the stock would have ended its 4-week losing streak.But it was not to be. The stock lost a nickel over the last 35 minutes, which was good enough for a green day, but not enough for a green week.I thought it was great that AH, some bloke bought 150 shares at $1.65, just so that trade would show all weekend. Wish it had been me. Thumbs up, friend!!But all is not lost. Thursday afternoon, the stock tested the low of $1.45 that had been set almost exactly 2 months before, on December 16. That low seemed…REALLY low back then, and as the stock surged above $2.00 on January 17, I wondered if we would ever get that low again.Silly me. As much as longs don’t like it, once a stock sets a low, it’s bound to re-test that low before really committing to a move upward.And, we survived it. By the skin of our teeth – one penny! But I have to call it a legitimate test. AND, it has climbed pretty impressively since that test – a 5-day chart shows it clearly.What does Sarge’s crystal ball say now? Not bluddy much. From a technical standpoint, this stock should climb right now. But look at what the market’s doing. Face it, friends. The market has never gone up without a correction. It won’t this time, either.Don’t listen to me, judge for yourself. Pull up a max chart of the ^IXIC. It looks…like a jet that’s heading to where the oxygen is too thin. The relevance here is that, if the overall market corrects, little old Idera really doesn’t have the mojo (read: “profits”) to withstand the onslaught.Not trying to be a downer. Just keeping it real.But today is Saturday on a holiday weekend. Put on some Joe Cocker. Turn it up.Sarge"
"Certainly a nice day for IDRA, great volume and nice % gain. we need lots more of these for many folks here to just break even. Hopefully this is just the start and we climb steadily over the next year."

"IDRA has been impressive of late - that’s all there is to it.Let’s look at the numbers. After gaining over 16% two weeks ago, and 25.9% last week, I would have understood if IDRA gave some back this week. But that’s not what happened. The stock gained 15% on Monday, then held its own the rest of the week, closing with a gain of 24 cents or 13.33% to close at $2.04The broader market was split, with bio pharma a leading sector. After two nice green weeks in a row, the NAS gave back just a smidge, down 0.18%. Its 2020 loss expanded from 3.59% to 3.76%. Hopefully, this is just a pause.The DOW was weighed down by BA again, and that pretty much made the difference. Our flagship index gave back 1.93%, bumping its 2020 loss from15.05% to 16.7%. My bio indexes followed up a spectacular week with more gains, but not many fireworks. The BTK followed up a gain of 9.5% with a gain of 2.48%; the IBB was less green, rising 1.24%; the XBI just about lapped the field, up 5.96%. The relatively conservative XLV gained a pedestrian 0.48%. The volatility index, the VXX, snapped a 4-week red streak. The ETN gained back 6.33% to close at $41.52. Boeing (BA), my poster child for this volatile era, lost over 6% in two of the five sessions. When the curtain fell on the week, the stock had lost $25.02 to close at $128.98 per share (16.2%). On 4/24/19, IDRA closed at $2.72. In spite of a tougher comparison, the YoY loss shrunk from 25.9% to 25%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.75-2.19T 1.90-2.11W 1.96-2.12Th 1.98-2.13F 2.00-2.10 And from last week:M 1.57-1.67T 1.68-1.75W 1.58-1.82Th 1.67-1.88F 1.77-1.89Swanky, swanky swanky. IDRA is moving on up to that deluxe apartment in the sky. I’m mixing my imagery, but you get the point.Yes, the stock is only at two bucks a share. But considering how far it has come, we should savor the moment.Scan up to the highs and lows for this week. On Friday, the low was $2.00. So for one entire session, the stock had a 2-handle. Know the last time that happened? November 20. 5 months ago.And volume was above average. Call me crazy, but I think the stock is being accumulated, by the folks that buy shares in lots of 10,000 and above.Will it stay above 2 bucks? Given recent history, I’d say that’s a long shot. But some party or parties think there are better days ahead for IDRA. That works for me.Sarge"
"This it?PD-1/L1 inhibitors have transformed MM treatment, however many patients (pts) remain refractory. Subsequent treatment options including ipi offer modest benefit (~13% respond) (Long, SMR 2016). IT IMO, a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, may improve response to ipi by activating innate and adaptive immune responses to overcome immune escape. Tumor biopsies obtained from both injected/local and uninjected/distant lesions during earlier studies show maturation of the mDC1 subset (CD1c+CD303-), upregulation of PD-L1 by tumor cells, and an IFNα response gene signature. On treatment( week 8) biopsies of uninjected/distant tumors show expression of CD56+ and Ki67+ effector CD8+T cells in responding pts, indicative of an abscopal effect. Initial clinical experience with IMO + ipi is promising resulting in the selection of 8mg as the RP2D. Here we report an analysis of the first 15 subjects that received 1+ doses of study drugs. Methods: This is a phase 2 study for adults with unresectable or MM refractory to a PD-1 inhibitor pts are eligible if they have an accessible tumor for IT administration of IMO. 8mg IMO is administered to a single tumor during weeks 1,2,3,5,8, and 11 along with ipi per the product label. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) using a 2-stage design. Results: A total of 24 pts have been treated with IMO + ipi including pts that received injections to deep visceral lesions and lymph nodes. Grade 3 /4 Immune-related AE were observed in 6 subjects [hypophysitis (N = 2), hepatitis (1), Gastritis (1), Guillain-Barre syndrome (1), Colitis (1), Neutropenia (1)]. These responded well to standard measures. Of 24 pts treated at the RP2D of 8mg, 15 were assessed for response with 47% ORR of and 67% disease control rate (1 Complete Response, 6 Partial Response(3 confirmed), 3 Stable disease). Phase 2 accrual is ongoing. Conclusions: IMO + ipi is a robust strategy to revive the immune response in PD-1/L1resistant tumors and the demonstrated substantial clinical benefit including durable responses in this clinically challenging pt population. This data supports the initiation of a phase 3 study compared to ipi alone."
"This rally is far from over. Touched $6 right after the open on very strong volume. After yesterday's good run, there will be expected volatility, with traders trying to take advantage of the swings. But the trend will still be higher. Soon, $6 will have looked like a good buying opportunity as the stock moves higher through the $6's and into the $7's. It is a very good sign that this rally is gaining steam weeks before the data is due to be released. There is a lot of pent up expectation here, and many on the sidelines are still trying to time their entry or add point. Don't expect much in the way of a pullback. Any dips will be filled in quickly, and if any shares are being shorted, they will likely be covered rapidly as traders realize they made the wrong move, further adding to the upward pressure. I would not be surprised to see the stock close above $6 today."
"My take on the JPM presentation:Milano paints a picture of a very focused company with very encouraging data. His discussion of partnerships and the balance sheet necessary to get to market was interesting. Basically, he said that he is not a fan of partnering because you give up too much in the future for life support now (my words, not his). I agree with him. However, he also acknowledged the balance sheet need to get to market, and he further indicated that interest from outside companies has increased ""dramatically"" (his word) in the last 3 months. My gut says that he knows he needs some sort of partner, but he wants it on his terms as much as possible and he was trying to use the pulpit at JPM to let all the suitors no he won't be easy but he is going to go home with someone, and only one someone. I found the monotherapy study interesting as well. He clearly indicated they were a bit surprised by the early response they have been seeing, particularly because they were in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. He emphasized it was early days on this, but the early results are apparently better than expected. I seem to recall someone here reporting that Bob Doody had at one point indicated that they did not think monotherapy was the best direction for 2125, so it seems that was the generally held view within the company.8400 info was really nothing new, and 3gA was as we had collectively analyzed it here - they have a target but they are waiting for the results of one more preclinical study before they make the go/no-go decision on going after APOC-III.As for tone, I thought it was frank and upbeat at the same time, which means Milano continues to be a hopeful realist.I remain very comfortable with my position in IDRA and am ready to add if the market gets the heebie jeebies when the r/s is announced. If not, I will sit tight and watch. Good luck folks."
"IDRA had its strongest week in months, and closed with a shiny 2-handle.Let’s look at the numbers. Last week, as the stock price drifted lower, IDRA saw very low volume. This week was a different story. Monday was no help, acting like a hangover from last week. But starting Tuesday, the volume started picking up significantly, along with the share price. In the end, the stock charged up 36 cents or 20.1% (!), to close at $2.15.The broader market was pretty much green. Old Reliable added 2.29% to its gains of the new year, closing 4.64% above where it closed 2019. Charging out of the gates again! A mite too fast, IMO. Looks like we may be due for a correction at some point soon.The DOW again lagged behind Reliable, but still impressively, gaining 1.82%. For the year, the oldest index is up 2.84%.My bio indexes looked pretty good, with one exception: the BTK lost 0.47% (due to a red Monday when all others were green); the IBB was up 1.2%; the XBI rose 1.52%. The conservative XLV was the winner, up 1.64%. On 1/17/19, IDRA closed at $2.96. This is down from last week’s comparison, so the Yoy loss is down from 50% to 27.4%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.76-1.80T 1.76-1.90W 1.85-2.09Th 1.89-1.98 F 1.99-2.24 And from last week:M 1.83-1.93T 1.76-1.88W 1.72-1.79Th 1.73-1.85 F 1.75-1.85Last week, I was bored with all the waiting, calling up memories of Otis Redding. This week it’s more like “The Waiting is Over”, by Kenny Loggins.Of course, we haven’t reached the Grail yet, by any means. But from the looks of the chart, we might be in for a little more fun before things level off.A one-year chart shows that the stock spent a lot of 2019 above $2.50. Before things fell off a cliff in November, the support was right around that level, with occasional rare and brief visits above $3.00.Now that financing is pretty much a non-issue for a while, I think the stock will continue to climb for a while. Hopefully the support level will be closer to $3.00, with excursions northward from there.I know that doesn’t sound exciting, but there’s a WHOLE lot of difference between being a $3 stock and a $2 stock. Higher prices than that level will have to wait for trial results.So stay tuned. The adventure resumes tomorrow.Sarge"
"Welcome to IDRA, aka the Emerald City.Let’s look at the numbers. Why Emerald City? Because IDRA was green every session this week. Know when that last happened to this stock? The week of May 14-18, 2018. Yeah, it’s rare.As you’ll see below, there was substantial sector support. Whatever the cause (besides the obvious return of @playthrough2001 to the MB), the stock had gains ranging from 2.68% to 15.4%, and closed up a dramatic 76 cents (39.6%) on the week, closing at $2.68. The stock now boasts a gain of 47.25% on the year.The broader market hosted a yawning festival, while the sector had a fireworks display. The NAS made it 3 red weeks in a row, but not dramatically so. The index lost 0.56%, and its gain on the year is now at 20.3% (which of course isn’t bad with the 3rd quarter not yet over). The DOW almost eeked out a win, but not quite, as it slid just 0.03%. For the year, the venerable index has given back 3.08%.BA reflected its index, and it’s a little weird the way that happens so often. It gained 0.57%, and trimmed its 2020 loss from 50.8% to 50.5%. My bio indexes were pretty stellar. The BTK set a brisk pace with a gain of 4.21%; the IBB was better, up 6.67%; the XBI was Best of Breed, soaring 11.3%. The XLV was annoyingly conservative, nudging up 0.91%. The VXX managed to go red every day this week, and I’m sure that’s rare too. It closed at $24.37, a loss of 4.51%. Might have to nibble here this week.On 9/18/19, IDRA closed at $2.90. That’s 10 cents lower than last week’s number. Combined with the stock’s stellar performance, the YoY loss was trimmed from 36% to 7.58%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.95-2.37T 2.07-2.39W 2.33-2.50Th 2.45-2.70F 2.47-2.75 And from last week:M HOLIDAYT 1.90-2.00W 1.96-2.05Th 1.93-1.99F 1.92-1.99Last week, I returned to a theme that’s applicable all too often around here: perseverance. I spoke wistfully of that time, off in the distant future, when we might reap the rewards of this investment.Little did I know.As I looked over my little spread sheet and saw that the stock was green every session, it struck me it was a rare phenomenon. But over 2 years? That really is rare.The cause has to be Tilso, or rather, anticipation of its trial results. Early in the week, the company announced its participation in the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) “virtual congress”, this weekend. There was also a presentation at the H.C. Wainwright Investment Conference on Tuesday afternoon; the stock did surge late that afternoon.I think a lot of it comes down to market cap. Take a look – Yahoo reports it’s under $95 million. Million? Seriously? So…just to get to a $1B market cap, the stock price would have to be over ten times higher. And the company has a product that is effective, mild, and keeps hitting its marks on trials…with different types of cancer? I think we’re in the midst of a serious market cap adjustment.Which is just beginning.Welcome back to the conversation, @playthrough2001. Fasten your seat belt. We may be climbing at a fairly steep rate for a while.Sarge"
"This bears repeating: I just love it when my stock keeps hitting 52-week highs!Let’s look at the numbers. Last Friday, the stock closed at a 52-week high of $4.29. The stock had reached a trading high of $4.90 the prior Friday (11/20), a mark in the sand that seemed out of reach.Monday, the stock gave back 16 cents (3.73%). Tuesday it roared back with a gain of 25 cents (6.05%) to set another new 52-week closing high. Wednesday, there was a buying frenzy for a second time in 2 weeks as the stock gained 80 cents or 18.2%, on huge volume. Again, new closing and trading highs were hit. The high water mark at $4.90 went down in 7 sessions.The last two sessions of the week, the stock gave back 3.28% and 2.79%, respectively, with the stock tumbling a bit early on Friday. But when the dust settled, it had gained 58 cents or 13.5% to close at $4.87. For the calendar year, the stock is now up 167.6%. The broader market provided support. The NAS had a solid gain of 2.12%. This is getting historic: its gain on the year rose to 38.9%!The DOW had a respectable showing, up 1.03%, crossing above 30,000 again along the way. The calendar year’s gain grew to 5.89%.BA continued to surge back to respectability. It has now gained 6.69%, 8.46%, and 7.49% in the past three weeks. Of course, it’s still down on the year by 28.6%.My bio indexes again joined the party. The BTK had a solid gain of 1.96%; the IBB was better, climbing 3.19%; the XBI was better still, up 3.61%. The XLV was in the hunt, up 2.85%. The VXX made it 5 red weeks in a row, losing 40 cents or 2.3%, and closing at $17.11.On 12/5/19, IDRA closed at $1.75. The YoY gain improved from 143.75% to 178%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 3.95-4.46T 4.11-4.43W 4.20-5.29Th 4.91-5.37F 4.62-5.04 And from last week:M 4.00-4.78T 3.78-4.28W 3.84-4.11Th ThanksgivingF 4.00-4.47Due to the trading action on Thursday and Friday, it doesn’t FEEL like time to celebrate IDRA right now. But it is.Over the past three weeks, the stock’s closing price has risen 71.5%. Chew on that.Tweak that just a bit. From Monday, 11/16 to Weds., 12/2, the closing price improved 87.7%.Finally, from the trading low of $2.63 on Monday, 11/16 to the trading high of $5.37 on Thursday, 12/3, the price increased 104%. That’s less than 3 weeks.What I really like is that the stock hasn’t just gone up. In fact, over the past 14 sessions, it was only green in 8. It does help to have a couple of gains over 18% mixed in, I’ll admit.Speaking of volume, in each of those 2 extraordinary sessions, the volume was around 6 times recent levels. Again, that is NOT individuals driving the volume. It has to be institutional.Make no mistake, IDRA’s roll continues. It’s party time!Sarge"
"To all my friends on the board: I will be traveling to Budapest, Lake Bled, Rovinj, Plitvice Park, Split, Hvar, Dubrovnik and London on an adventure. I will be checking in but likely not posting much. I think we have a winner here. I bought 3 separate times at these levels. I think we will see encouraging results at ASCO. Good luck to all. Peace out."
"Sometimes, a win is a win. Even if you get absolutely no style points.Let’s look at the numbers. Like last week, IDRA headed into the closing session up on the week. A week ago, the stock collapsed to close red by over 4%. This Thursday morning, at a price of $4.35, the “lead” was ten cents when the short session began. Afternoon trading took the price below $4.22 as the stock’s chances of a green week flickered.But, as the close approached on a thin day of trading, a buy of 6,000 shares at 12:58 pm brought the stock back to green. The stock closed the week up by a penny (0.24%) at $4.26. For the year, the gain nudged up from 133.5% to 134.1%. The broader market was mildly supportive. The NAS tacked another 0.38% to its gain on the year, which is now 42.71%. Simply amazing.The DOW was green, but just barely, with a gain of 0.06%. The calendar year gain is now 5.82%.BA made it 3 red weeks in a row, falling 1.18%. The year’s deficit is now 33.34%.My bio indexes were almost all positive, if not gushing. The BTK followed up a huge gain last week with another 0.29%; the IBB was just as pedestrian, up 0.24%; the XBI was the local hero, climbing 1.67%. The XLV was the only player to close in the red, down 1.36%. The VXX was red for a second straight week, sliding 15 cents or 0.88% to close at $16.88.On 12/248/19, IDRA closed at $1.95, which is 45 cents higher than last week’s comparison. The YoY gain therefore fell from 183.3% to 118.5%. I can live with that.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.05-4.44T 4.14-4.67W 4.18-4.48Th 4.21-4.40F Christmas And from last week:M 3.95-4.56T 3.83-4.28W 4.38-5.50Th 4.55-4.97F 4.22-4.67So yeah, no style points. I mean, IDRA basically moon-walked (80’s dance feature made wildly famous for a time by Michael Jackson) its way to a win. Looking forward, but actually walking backward.But the thing is, stocks go in streaks. When it comes to watching stocks on a technical basis, momentum is practically everything. This week had no pizzaz, but it did show signs that the stock price is changing directions from down to up. Such changes often start with just one small gain.Also, look at the “bass line” on the daily highs and lows. Look at what the low price did each day this week: it went up. Each day, a stock’s price is a pitched battle between bulls and bears. Each day this week, the bears could not bring the stock down to as low as it had been the session before.It all makes sense, of course, because there is news on the near horizon on Tilso that could cause a big rise in the stock price. The market is making its bet on the outcome of that news.I do like Tilso. It’s a benign medicine that jump starts the body’s own defenses to help fight cancer, making other meds more effective along the way. Sounds like value to me.So strap in, my long friends. Barring some market-wide cataclysm, from here it looks like we’re heading up.Sargehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3t9-kf7ZNA"
"Beyond ORR Why I like Tilsotolimod. There are many positives beyond just ORR.1. It can be used with existing FDA approved drugs.2. The process of manufacturing and supplying drug has already been addressed. Tilsotolimod comes in set dose sterile vials.3. It can be administered in an intratumoral route that has been proven to be relatively easy to perform by similar methods of obtaining biopsies in a standard community interventional radiology department without special requirements. 4.The ease of administration makes it acceptable for elderly patients without undue risk or overly invasive procedures.5.The intratumoral route likely reduces the chance of systemic toxicity.6.The safety has been extensively studied in prior and current studies. In current studies the toxicity is minimal, acceptable and no more than Ipilimumab alone.7. After a relatively short treatment cycle compared to traditional chemotherapy, patients that respond favorably can go on with their lives without having to return for further/continued treatments.8. Unlike some TLR-like agents and other intratumorally administered agents currently being tested, only ONE tumor needs to be injected with Tilsotolimod.9. Proving the ease and effectiveness of the intratumoral route of Tilsotolimod allows easy expansion into solid tumors and visceral metastases."
"When GILD can pay AGEN $150m upfront with 1.7b milestones for the Collaboration to Develop Immuno-Oncology Therapies and as far as I know AGEN has not generated any IO data yet ( someone can correct me, if I am wrong) . So think about it for IDRA also get this kind of deal will not be that difficult because IDRA has very clear and effective and best ORR for the most challenging patients group."
"22-28, 70-75, 15-25. What significance do these numbers have? They are what will lift IDRA to the next level within the next 6-12 weeks. 22-28% ORR---beating the current SOC of 14% by 60-100%. 70-75% stable disease---giving patients with refractory melanoma a longer life, better quality of life, and hope that future therapy may be developed to cure their cancer. 15-25 patients with complete responses---representing 5-8% of the trial population. To these patients and their families this would be no less than a miracle, and you can't put a price on that. In anticipation of these numbers the stock price will certainly rise considerably from here. When these numbers do materialize, the stock will pop 50, 75, maybe even 100% from wherever it is, and if you're out-----you missed it, because the stock price will not back down and the company becomes a bona-fide buyout candidate overnight. The next few weeks should be some of the best for shareholders in some time. Happy New Year to all."
"OK---here's another take, so everyone can make money....The P3 data comes out on Tilso and it matches or slightly exceeds the P2 data with melanoma----and Yervoy(not with pembro yet). Over 20-25%PR, let's say 5-10% CR, 75% ""stable disease"", and median overall survival 40-60% greater than with current SOC----the FDA decides to give expedited review, and the stock price shoots up to $10/share. NOW----Big pharma takes a much more serious look at IDRA since the data is much better than standard of care and tilso has many more possible uses, a bidding war breaks out, and by the time it is over, the stock price is $35/share making the company worth $1 Billion. Now---that may sound like a lot, but remember that the acquiring company would also be getting ALL of IDRA's IP and patents on 3GA research and compounds that IDRA had to table to devote everything to getting tilso approved and to market. Now it's a better value proposition for a large pharma company where $1 billion is a drop in the bucket. Better??"
"Interestingly in melanoma the combo of ipi and nivo given in the same cycle more or less simultaneously (concurrent arm) resulted in improved ORR (53%) but toxicity (53% grade 3,4 SAE) was significant. The combo of initial ipi with later subsequent nivo infusion (sequenced arm) had less than half the toxicity (18%) but unfortunately less than half the ORR (20%) as well. Looking at Illuminate-206 for solid tumors (Tilso+ipi+nivo) it is interesting that on clinicaltrials.gov, they have not divulged how the combination of ipi and nivo will be administered. My speculation is that perhaps they will take a sequence approach and take advantage of the tumor specific intratumoral antigen priming/presentation of Tilso with ipi to enhance the initial response then improve the durability of the response by using nivo after the tumor is hot. The hope would be you would then get the benefit of improved ORR (like the concurrent arm) with reduced toxicity (like the sequenced arm). Undoubtedly BMS is interested in the possibility of using both of their drugs in combinations in multiple solid tumor types if the toxicity can be harnessed. Hopefully that is where Tilso comes in. The mechanisms of Tilso, ipi and nivo all seem to be distinct and perhaps the benefits translatable across multiple tumor types. BMS should be watching very closely. There is a reason they are supplying the drugs on their dime."
"As Jackie used to ask who is still in long and strong. Rainman is in trimmed down a bit to 5k shares. Pipe in if you'd like, good luck and hoping for some good news in the pre-market data release."
"After gaining almost 19% last week, IDRA was green again this week. It’s not much, but it’s a step.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA was green 3 sessions out of 4 this week. The difference was Thursday; while the sector lagged, Idera managed a gain. Friday was also green, and the stock closed up 4 cents or 2.2%, closing at $1.86.The broader market was flat to green, but the sector lagged again. Old Reliable stumbled a bit on Monday, and closed 2019 up by 35.2%. Not its biggest gain of all time, but still, a spectacular year. It started 2020 up by .54%.The DOW also ended 2019 impressively, up 22.7%. Quite a year for the venerable index! And it closed after 2 sessions in the new year up by 0.34%. My bio indexes made it 2 red weeks in a row: the BTK lost 2.39%; the IBB fell 2.63; the XBI tumbled 2.99%. The conservative XLV was relatively unscathed, down 1.65%. On 1/4/19, IDRA closed at $3.66. The YoY comparison starts the year down by 49.2%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.75-1.89T 1.73-1.85W New Year’s DayTh 1.76-1.86 F 1.80-1.91 And from last week:M 1.54-1.99T 1.86-1.99W ChristmasTh 1.85-1.96 F 1.75-1.86 Imagine me with a great big flag behind me. “The longest journey begins with a single step…”Well, I won’t be channeling Patton today. But it was significant that the stock did not give back some of its gains from last week, as it has so many times in the recent past. For now, I’ll take it.After the big gain on 12/23, volume has picked up. Not dramatically, but measurably. On Thursday, the volume did sink to about 88,000, but other than that, it has pushed 200,000 most days. It’s not MSFT just yet, but I’d say volume is roughly 40-50% higher than before the news.The uncertainty part of the financing is now resolved. That has, and will increasingly, be reflected in the market cap.But. There’s always a “but”, isn’t there, Sarge? Well, usually.I am concerned about international tensions. If tensions escalate, it will likely be reflected in the stock market, as it was at the open yesterday. And without actual earnings…or an approved product…IDRA is vulnerable.So, what say we put a little more distance between the stock price and the recent lows, so that if there’s a widening of hostilities, the stock has some room to correct? The marker is $1.45, both as a trading and a closing low. That’s the support we need to hold. And we wait for results on Tilso. I continue to have high hopes that it will ultimately become part of the handful of meds doctors will use as a “cocktail” of treatment for certain types of solid tumors. But there are many rivers to cross until we get there. Sarge"
"Comparing the TLR-9 players It's not always easy comparing data among companies in the same space since the data is often reported differently (creatively) and the patient populations often vary. In the TLR-9 field some areas of comparison can be made in the little raw data available. First off, the 3 main players, Idera, Dynavax, and Checkmate have all focused on melanoma mostly due to the need for better agents, the ease of access to lesions both for treatment and biopsy, the rapidity of obtaining results and the relative ease of evaluating results. Idera: Chose to study the sickest patients. Not only are they anti-PD-1 refractory but they also had multiple previous treatments. Agents: IMO-2125 and Ipilimumab Checkmate: Chose to study patients that were anti-PD-1 resistant and had a median of 2 prior treatments. Agents: CMP-001 and Pembrolizumab Dynavax: Chose to study patients that were both anti-PD-1 naive and those that were anti-PD-1 refractory. It has been popular to say that their patients had received less treatments and therefore were less sick but that really only applies to the anti-PD-1 naive patients. The anti-PD-1 refractory group actually had 2 or more prior treatment lines in 12 of the 13 patients studied. Agents: SD-101 and Pembrolizumab. So there are no directly comparable groups since IDRA used ipi and the other 2 players used pembro. Neither Idera or Checkmate studied anti-PD-1 naive patients. However, if you look at the Intention to Treat (ITT) groups in the anti-PD-1 refractory patient populations the result are as follows: ORR ITT population anti-PD-1 refractory only Idera: 6 of 18 (33%) Checkmate: 15 of 69 (22%)Dynavax 2 of 13 (15%) Furthermore from the available data IMO-2125 clearly wins in the durability of response. All 3 companies showed the abscopal effect and biopsy data showed similar mechanisms of action. It should be noted that the ITT group for IDRA was based on 4,8,16,32 mg patients. Once you hone down to the RP2D cohort using the 8 mg dose the ORR is 50% with an additional PR patient out greater than 1 year in the 4 mg cohort. I do not know the background of either Dynavax or Checkmate to comment on RP2D or caveats that may make the ITT group appear less impressive. It would appear that IMO-2125 is in the hunt for best in class. ASCO should shed more light on the field."
"Sometimes it is good to review just exactly what Dr. Diab said:Dr. Diab post ASCO event: rough notes. MDA pushed achieving 35% response rate to prove without a doubt that the responses seen were due to Tilsotolimod and not Ipi. So far the ORR is 38% with the possibility, (actually anticipated), that some some stable disease patients will likely convert to responders.Dr. Diab thinks it is important to achieve this ORR and he is very comfortable that the response rate is beyond Ipi alone. One of the PR patients has had 88% tumor reduction and by next scan will likely be a CR. Radiologist already opined that the residual tumor seen is not active tumor and considers the patient a CR. (IDRA and MDA are intellectually honest still calling this a PR for now). He mentioned another patient that will likely be a CR on the next scan. I am not sure if these patients are the same patient because he mentioned them at different times. So we can expect at least 1 if not 2 CR patients with the next cut. The patient profile types in phase 2 are very much representative of what is seen in practice. This bodes well for the phase 3 trial so that you are treating the same types of patients. He said if you want your phase 3 to be successful you must treatthe same patients in phase 2. Seems obvious but likely a reason why phase 3 trials fail after a successful phase 2. The 24 hour biopsy data confirms the effect of Tilsotolimod as it shows the activation of innate immune cells and activation and increase of dendritic cells BEFORE Ipi has been administered. He has not seen 24 hour biopsy data performed in other TLR-9 trials.He believes that the stringent 35% response rate chosen as the cutoff supports that it is the TLR-9 that is providing the effect. He would not like to talk about the other drugs ( he is clearly telegraphing that he thinks this is the best TLR-9 in my opinion) but in his opinion this is the ONLY trial that provides evidence that the drug is doing what a TLR-9 is supposed to do. In other agents/trials one showed 15% response rate and another 19-22% response rate which is NOT convincing that the effect was beyond that Ipi alone would provide. He also pointed out that in patients that fail a PD-1 and nevertheless continue on the PD-1 after the failure have as high as a 19% response rate. So the 38% response rate for Tilsotolimod is VERY impressive in this light. A secondary goal of the trial has been to show that intratumoral injection is easy and feasible and can be performed by any competent community interventional radiologist. This is important because they anticipate applying this approach to other cancers without cutaneous lesions. That is other solid tumor/visceral cancer types. The biomarker data that was accepted by ASCO for presentation only will further prove the effects of Tilsotolimod beyond Ipi. This point is being driven home in anticipation I believe of FDA approval process. Unlike other intratumoral platforms only ONE lesion is injected. This bodes well for patient comfort, safety, cost, IR logistics. One and done.19 of 26 patients were from MDA but this was due to later addition of the new centers rather than a bias. The reason the sites were added was due to the excitement of early results."
"It’s the dog days for IDRA. Which is good, because that’s exactly how it feels.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA went red for a second week in a row, falling 9 cents or 3.18% to close at $2.74. Still longing for the posh life of a 3-handle…For 2019, IDRA has gone back to red, with a 1.17% loss. The sector also had a lousy week. The NAS went red on the week for the first time in 2019, dropping 2.47% and bringing the year’s gain down to 11.7%. My bio indicators, however, made the NAS look like a party: the BTK fell 5.44%; the IBB was worse, down 5.65%; not to be outdone, the XBI sank the most, losing 5.83%. The XLV was better but still bad, losing 3.82%. The DOW joined the losing parade, off by “just” 2.21%. Down 2 weeks in a row now, the year’s gain is down to 9.1%. On 3/8/18, IDRA closed at $16.16 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now at 83%. Let’s not dwell on this. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.70-2.93T 2.77-2.88W 2.57-2.84Th 2.45-2.84 F 2.66-2.80And from last week:M 2.80-3.05T 2.88-2.98W 2.88-3.09Th 2.71-3.02 F 2.64-2.84So, optimistically, here’s the thing: we’ve spent one more week with some distance between the current price and the lows of late January. The longer this lasts, the stronger that level of support becomes. That’s as good as I can put it regarding the current stock price.I owe you an update on my NVAX episode that I mentioned last week. Well, I’m not a genius just yet. Recall that the stock had slid from $2.13 to 71 cents, where I added to my position for a relatively low price. Of course, I expected it bounce back right away.That didn’t happen. I added to my position AGAIN this Wednesday, when the stock was at 0.557. It closed Friday at 52 cents a share.I’ll tell ya, the Street is ruthless. As an old friend on the AVNR board used to say, the traders are sharks, and we individual investors are just chum.Well, we are. For a time. Part of the “fun” of investing, apparently, is feeling humiliated after you make a trade. At least in the short term. At least, that’s how it seems to happen for ME. But you buy stocks in pharma development not for what the price will be next week, but for what it will be 6 months or a year from now. Or two years…For IDRA, we must continuously monitor the science. THAT’s the issue – does the company we have invested in have VALUE. If it does, we should stick with our investment, and buy on the dips if possible. If it does not, we need to find another place to invest.I’m so grateful to Tursta and Alridge, and all who help on the science front. We have learned that Tilso is very popular in potential combo with other therapies. The “cocktail” approach seems to be the newest, best practice for battling certain forms of cancer. It could very well be that Tilso will be part of a lot of combination therapies, when all is said and done.We watch, and we wait. And we try to keep in mind that the market was not designed for immediate gratification, especially in this industry. More like eventual gratification. But if we’ve played our cards right, that gratification will be significant. Sarge"
"IDRA made it 9 green sessions out of 10 today, setting new 52-week highs for trading ($3.47) and closing ($3.18). Today's volume was about twice recent averages.During those 10 sessions, the stock has risen from a closing price of $2.09 on 10/21. Today's closing price is 52.9% higher.Sarge"
"After getting smacked for a 20% loss last week, I hoped IDRA might bounce back this week. Apparently you don’t always get what you hope for.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA didn’t even rate a “dead cat bounce” comment, as 4 cents (1.58%) doesn’t seem very springy at all. Closing price: $2.57. For 2019, IDRA has gone back to red. Can you believe that in my last report 3 weeks ago, there was a gain of 28.9% on the year? Today, the tally stands at a loss of 7.22%. The sector actually outperformed the broader market. The NAS made it at least 4 red weeks in a row, dropping 2.29% to close at 7637. For 2019, the index, which was green by 23% the last time I posted, is now up just 15.1%. My bio indicators were all green, if not overly impressive in doing so: the BTK was up by 0.45%; the IBB was not quite as green, up 0.41%; the XBI was higher, but by the scantest margin, up 0.42%. The XLV took the Cup, rising a relatively impressive 1.26%. The DOW was also in the red but not horribly, sliding 0.69%. For 2019, it is now green by 9.96%. Last report this gain was at 13.6%, and I noted at the time that it was a large gain for the beginning of May.On 5/24/18, IDRA closed at $15.44 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down to 83.3%. And it feels like the stock just keeps digging.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.41-2.69T 2.62-2.90W 2.71-3.17Th 2.56-2.76 F 2.49-2.69 And from last week:M 3.02-3.06T 2.75-3.18W 2.61-2.84Th 2.45-2.71 F 2.47-2.60Can you believe this stock had a 4-handle about 3 weeks ago? Yep, on May 6, the stock traded as high as $4.19. And today, we sit in the mid-two-dollar range.That first week of the month, the stock was buoyed by an earnings surprise, and a generous show of support by the Baker Bros. Alas, that is ancient history now. The sector has been sagging over the past few weeks, and without news, IDRA is defenseless to buck the trend. And you get these nasty days when the stock has a double digit loss on not so high volume, and at the end of the day you look around and say, “What happened?”.Remember, time is on our side. BELIEVE in the abscopal effect! BELIEVE that a handful of patients will be upgraded since the last time around! Because that’s all it would take. Then suddenly, IDRA would have a treatment that is exceeding expectations, and then…it could get exciting.Music to come in a reply.Sarge"
"Illuminate-301 Enrollment Complete!! Way ahead of schedule. With literally dozens (hundreds) of melanoma trials ongoing and competing for patients, this obviously indicates enthusiasm for using this strategy in this patient population."
"Update on Bob Doody.. received clarification from him this morning.. better news...I took a step back from my full time role into a strategic consulting role. I felt it was best for the company based on the lower volume of IR needs and that the money would be better suited to go to the trials and get Tilso to the finish line. Jill is gonna take over some of the day to day stuff in addition to her HR work with my guidance. I’m still involved, but just not full time.You can email either of us, but certainly feel free to try out Jill as well. She is great! I still have my email. I know it has been a long road but light is at the end of the tunnel.Feel free to share with the others."
"IDRA is doing a good job of trying the patience of its long investors. So we have to look for signs.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA has now gone red three red weeks in a row, this time losing 6 cents or 2.25% to close at $2.61. For 2019, IDRA meandered slightly deeper into red territory. Compared to the share price of $2.77 on 12/31/18, the stock is down 5.78%. The market was flat to slightly green, and the sector was mostly red. Or maybe pink, as it wasn’t very red. The NAS continued to add to its gain for the year, up 1.94%, and bringing its 2019 gain to an even 23%. Note: this is in half a year. My bio indicators all ended around break-even, plus or minus: the BTK was down 0.32%; the IBB nudged down 0.1%; the XBI was the “biggest loser”, down 0.57%. The XLV was the only one hanging out at the green party, up 1.19%. The DOW was relatively impressive this week, up 1.21%. The 2019 gain is now 15.7%. On 7/5/18, IDRA closed at $11.36 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now 77%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.60-2.76T 2.55-2.68W 2.67-2.74Th Holiday F 2.57-2.65 And from last week:M 2.66-2.78T 2.67-2.80W 2.55-2.72Th 2.54-2.73 F 2.60-2.75As individual investors in a pharma development company, we sometimes have to look hard for signs that there is real value in the company. The most obvious signs are trial results, but as we all WELL know, these moments are spread far apart.So we keep looking. Sometimes it seems like we’re trying to find tea leaves to read.But once in a while, it knocks on our virtual front door.This week, a poster made an argument that IDRA was a hopeless investment. It was an actual example of “fake news”, in that the allegation that all of IDRA’s prospects had been failures was clearly untrue. Our stalwart friend @Alridge95 defended the company, shining a nice bright light on the truth.What does the presence of this attack mean? I mean, other than being mildly entertaining and giving us a chance to cheer Al on, what does it signify?It signifies that someone out there is a little scared of IDRA. This was not a random event. Nor do I think the poster was acting alone.So get this: IDRA has parties out there that are concerned about it. Concerned enough to come to a forum for the stock, and try and spread misinformation.What a nice sign of validation.Sarge"
Have a great Thanksgiving everyone and good luck to us all in December. Hopefully IDRA gives us greater hope with their new trial numbers.
"Yup, I knew all along we’d end the week green. Not!Let’s look at the numbers. After gaining 39.6% two weeks ago, IDRA came back to earth some last week with a loss of 14.9%. This week, through Wednesday, looked like more of the same as the stock stood 6.14% below last Friday’s close.But Thursday, there was a glimmer of hope as we gained back 5.14%. That put us 3 cents down on the week. Then news came from Washington overnight and it looked like the whole market was going to tumble Friday. I pretty much wrote IDRA off. But it surprised me by gaining 4 cents to close the week up a penny (0.44%) at $2.29.The broader market was mixed, without much conviction one way or the other. The NAS managed a second green week in a row with a gain of 1.48%. Its yearly tally is at 23.4%, as we begin the 4th quarter. The DOW was actually ended up the “big winner” among the indices I follow, ending the week up 1.87%. For the year, its loss shrank from 4.78% to 2.99%.BA had a big week. The stock was up 4 sessions out of 5, ending with a gain of 7.72%. Its 2020 loss shrunk from 52.1% to 48.4%. As BA goes, so goes the DOW…My bio indexes were mixed, but mostly a light shade of red. The BTK had a tiny loss of 0.21%; the IBB eeked out a tiny gain of 0.03%; the XBI was last in the pack, but the loss was just 0.41%. The XLV was big winner, “soaring” 1.11%. The VXX managed a second green week in a row, though it was nothing spectacular. It closed at $25.78, a gain of 0.94%. Frankly, waking up to the news Friday, I would have expected a bigger gain here.On 10/4/19, IDRA closed at $2.75. That’s 4 cents higher than last week’s number. Since IDRA only gained a penny this week, the YoY loss grew from 15.9% to 16.7%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.25-2.39T 2.20-2.34W 2.11-2.22Th 2.10-2.25F 2.11-2.33 And from last week:M 2.43-2.68T 2.22-2.55W 2.20-2.54Th 2.01-2.19F 2.07-2.34IDRA is a little hard to figure out.It seems to have managed to stay under the radar to many on Wall St. In spite of some pretty successful signs in the clinic, its 3-month average daily volume is only 156,000.That’s tiny enough for the stock to be vulnerable. I’ve seen it before. Bump along at around 100k volume on a day, and come the closing bell, a 2-cent gain can turn into a penny’s loss, on a 100-share trade.Which makes yesterday hard to figure out. Volume for the whole day was just under 125,000 shares. The stock spent the first half of the day in the red, and was hovering around breakeven for the week as we entered the last minutes of trade.In my experience, with stocks that I own, this usually ends one way: a sale at the end of the day that puts you red on the week. I am resigned to this fate.But yesterday, at the close, the stock held on. It makes no sense.Except for this. With our penny’s gain on the week, the stock now has a market cap of $80.6 million. That’s pocket change by Street standards. And the company has a cancer drug that works and only benign side effects? That is being tested for more and more types of cancer?SOMEBODY must like this stock. And maybe, just maybe, that somebody and we little retailers will share the same joy some day. It could happen. This is America.So dream big, friends. Add if you can.Sarge"
"It will be interesting to see the NKTR update on melanoma at ASCO.

For a company where IDRA is, in drug development, when you miss the primary endpoint of your lead product badly, your stock gets decimated.I had big plans for this investment. Thursday afternoon, they came to an abrupt halt.I’m not going to sell all of my IDRA. But I am selling most. I’m invested in some other drug development companies, as I mentioned here yesterday.But I’ve started a new position. Some years back, I bought 5 shares of AMZN. The stock had gotten beaten up, and it was under $300.00 per share. Earnings were coming up, and I thought it might be time for the stock to come back.I was right. Earnings were blowout, and my shares went up about $100 per share. I sold them for a nice profit of around 33% in the space of a few sessions. Felt pretty good.How do you think I feel now about that trade? Regrets galore.As we’ve been watching and waiting for IDRA, I’ve been looking at other companies with high share prices. That have actual products and income. I’ve thought, when the 301 results come out, I might invest in a company with more than just potential.But that kind of stock takes a stack full of money to invest.Then comes Thursday afternoon. I’ll admit, the news was a gut punch.But as I got to thinking what to do next, I thought, this is an opportunity. If I liquidate the lion’s share of my stake here, even at a 62% discount, there will be a chunk of cash available. To invest in one of those expensive stocks, with earnings and stuff.So I did. I’m not going to say where I invested, because, after carrying the banner here for so long, I don’t think I have the right to.Assess your situation. Perhaps this disappointment will free you to do something else that you’ve wanted to do.Thanks to all who have read here and made this a most congenial message board.

"If there was a painting of IDRA’s fortunes this week, it would have to be in black and white. Maybe a red slash somewhere.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA edged closer to the low end of it’s range this week. Red 4 out of 5 days, the stock fell 31 cents or 11.5% to close at $2.39. More later.The broader market was green for a seventh week in a row. Old Reliable gained another notch, up 1.06%, bringing its 2019 tally up to 27.7%. Really – can this last the whole year?The DOW kept pace, in fact out-pacing its younger rival, up 1.22% and bringing its 2019 gain up to 18.97%. My bio indexes were green but not by much: the BTK was up 1.23%; the IBB was green by 0.46%; the XBI was even more lackluster, up 0.35%. The conservative XLV was the rear guard, nudging forward 0.27%. On 11/8/18, IDRA closed at $8.87. The YoY loss is now at 73.1%. I will make no further comments about near-term comparisons, having gone 0-for-2 the past two weeks.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.58-2.75T 2.57-2.67W 2.43-2.69Th 2.42-2.68 F 2.37-2.52 And from last week:M 2.55-2.70T 2.50-2.67W 2.63-2.73Th 2.64-2.72 F 2.60-2.72Last week, I said there were signs of life in IDRA. Did I ever mention that I’m not in the medical profession?The three-month chart says it all. The stock hit its 52-week low back on August 15; trading low was $2.08; closing low was $2.12. I don’t like saying it, but it looks like the stock is going to re-test that low.That’s the bad news, and in that respect, if @kenneth is really thinking at adding around here, the timing could be either very good (if the support holds), or very bad (Look out, below!).I’m betting on the bounce myself, and if the stock does get down to the two-teens, I will probably not be able to resist, as always. And, as always, I’ll probably buy too soon.But it’ll be a bargain. I just can’t resist a bargain…Sarge"
anyone want to speculate on what is driving today's positive price action?? I am always skeptical. Being a long here for about 5 years as well as being down 90% in my investment. I just need this to get to $27 to break even... Not holding my breath.
"Last week, IDRA was impressive. This week, it improved on that.Let’s look at the numbers. After gaining over 16% last week, IDRA jumped out Monday by gaining 21 cents (14.7%), then another 11 cents (6.7%) Tuesday. Weds. and Friday were red, but only by a total of 3 cents, while on Thursday, the stock gained 8 cents (4.6%). When the dust settled, the stock had gained 37 cents or 25.9%.The broader market made it two solid weeks of gains in a row. The NAS followed up on the 10.58% it gained last week with another 6.15% to the green. It’s 2020 loss shrunk from 9.13% to 3.59%. Truly, the NAS has recovered a lot of the ground it lost in just 4 weeks.The DOW was green, but with only a pedestrian gain from BA, it did not wow the market. The oldest index trudged ahead 2.21% on the week, to trim its 2020 loss from 16.9% to 15.05%. My bio indexes brought down the house. The BTK set an extraordinary pace with a gain of 9.5%, which was, incredibly, not the best of the bunch; the IBB was a close second, up 9.36%; the XBI took the Cup for a second week in a row, up 9.73%. The relatively conservative XLV had a week that at another time might have caused headlines, up 6.27%. The volatility index, the VXX, was red for a fourth week in a row. The ETN lost $2.52 or 6.06% to close at $39.05. Boeing (BA), my poster child for this volatile era, gained 14.7% on Friday. But that only made it possible for the stock to end the week green by 1.42%, as the stock closed at $154.00 per share. On 4/17/19, IDRA closed at $2.43. This more favorable comparison, combined with the stock’s gain of almost 26%, combined to shrink the YoY loss from 48.9% to 25.9%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.57-1.67T 1.68-1.75W 1.58-1.82Th 1.67-1.88F 1.77-1.89 And from last week:M 1.23-1.31T 1.22-1.37W 1.38-1.71Th 1.39-1.51F Market Closed If you looked at a one-month chart for IDRA, not knowing any other history, you’d think it was nothing but blue skies ahead. But a year’s chart shows that the stock had come down a long way before beginning a comeback about a month ago.Clearly, the private placement last week put a boost into the stock. You know the old book, The Red Badge of Courage? On Wall St., it’s more like The Green Badge of Credibility. If supporters are willing to throw money your way, it could be a hint of the underlying value of your company.While I’m tickled with the past two weeks, one need look back only 32 days to see a time when IDRA traded at 81 cents a share.That’s well over a 100% gain from the low. When a stock covers that much ground in a matter of weeks, it would be surprising NOT to see any profit taking.So, if the stock backs off just a bit in the next couple weeks, remember where we’ve been. Taking profits is part of the game. So don’t be surprised. It will not be a sign of the company’s demise, in spite of what you might hear around here.In the meantime, take care, friends. Go out on the porch and enjoy this nice spring day. Life could be worse.Sarge"
"A one-handle. Say it ain’t so, Joe.Let’s look at the numbers, and see if Joe’s right. IDRA tumbled for a third week in a row. The stock was red 3 out of 5 days instead of the customary 4, but the two days that were NOT red, the stock closed even for the day. In the end, the loss was 27 cents or 12.8%, to close at $1.84. That’s the third straight week with at least an 11% loss. Mudville has seen better days.The broader market paused just a bit this week. Old Reliable was Less Reliable, trimming its tally by 0.25%. This nudged its yearly gain down to 28.4%. Just a tiny chink in the armor.The DOW lost a little more than the NAS, 0.46%, bringing its 2019 gain to 19.8%. If you’d been asked in January if you’d take that return for the year, you’d take it!My bio indexes all outperformed, and it’s starting to look like a trend: the BTK was up 3.42%; the IBB did a mite better by gaining 3.51%; the XBI was the star, up 3.95%. The conservative XLV got the Participation Award with a gain of 0.82%. If you want to see a thing of beauty, take a look at a 3-month chart for the IBB!On 11/23/18, IDRA closed at $7.30. The YoY loss is now at 74.8%. This is just kind of depressing.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.05-2.16T 2.06-2.11W 2.00-2.11Th 1.75-2.00 F 1.80-1.90 And from last week:M 2.20-2.46T 2.02-2.34W 2.05-2.18Th 2.06-2.16 F 2.06-2.17Patience is a virtue. In investing, especially in pharma development, it’s a necessity.My fears from last week came true, as the recent lows did NOT hold as support, and the stock showed a one-handle for the first time since before the RS. Great.Now, we get a short, quirky week, again not ideal for this sector.But here’s the good news. In my experience, there is a great deal of difference between a stock hovering around one dollar per share, and a stock hovering around $2.00. IMO, the $1.00 level is still basically speculative. But $2.00 holds more legitimacy.That was certainly the case with AVNR. For YEARS, the stock languished around a buck. Then Sam Islay’s group invested and took the stock to the $2.00 range, and frankly, there was no looking back.So don’t despair just yet. There is news coming down the pike that could propel this stock much higher, and bring this dark night to an end. Time will tell – whether we like it or not!Enjoy our uniquely American holiday this week, a tradition started by Lincoln. I suggest you find a way to sit at the kid’s table. The conversation will be much more fun!Sarge"
"Nautilus Holdco S-4:The structure keeps BCRX and IDRA as wholly owned subsidiaries of Nautilus Holdco (by the way, someone must be a Jules Verne fan - Nautilus, Boat and Island are the names of the entities created for this transaction). Not that unusual and there could be lots of reasons for it, but there will still be two separate entities, which could make it easier to sell an asset if they chose to do so. The IDRA warrants will not accelerate. They will be replace with warrants in Nautilus, but with the price and amount adjusted by the .2 to 1 factor that is applied to shareholders as well. The share exchange ratios are fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect the relative differences in share price between BCRX and IDRA.There is a very interesting narrative starting on page 54 of the S-4. Stonehouse started shopping the company (or exploring strategic alternatives, if you prefer) in early 2016. He danced with one small biotech about a merger and one big pharma about an acquisition, but in each case the counterparty walked away. In the case of the large pharma, the stated reason was the prospective buyer did not want to pay a significant premium to the then-market cap of BCRX.Milano and Stonehouse then started talks in August of 2016. These continued through the end of October of 2016 when the companies decided to stay separate but also stay in touch. Thereafter, in December 2016, a privately held biotech approached BCRX, but backed away within a month or so. For those keeping score, this is the 4th dance partner of 2016 for BCRX (including IDRA). Beginning in early 2017, BCRX had discussions with 3 other companies. During this time, IDRA had discussions with one company about IDRA acquiring/merging with that company. This same company also had previously had discussions with BCRX. Ultimately, IDRA and BCRX started up discussions again in September, this time initiated by Milano. The talks ultimately resulted in the agreement we now have. This is a really interesting chronology that spans two years, but the upshot is that BCRX was really trying to get a deal done, although in fairness their hand got stronger as their HAE results came in really well. IDRA was clearly looking for a partner as well, but it seems they really wanted a collaboration agreement with a bigger player, especially post-ESMO.I am nowhere near finished with the S-4, but I need to have a drink now......"
"Notes from webcast:1. Checkpoint inhibitors rescue an already existing immune response - but most people do not actually have an immune response.2. TLR9 agonist is designed to make the immune system treat cancer like an infection.3. When a person fails checkpoint treatment, the response rate with ipi as a second treatment is 13% and half of those that respond do not have a durable response past 6 months.4. Diab is speaking with IDRA about building another cohort for ocular melanoma (which is currently excluded)5. The target ORR is 35% for the study (this is to remove any doubt that the responses are due to ipi alone)6. Older population than in usual trials.7. The patient population has many of the same disease characteristics as a phase 3 trial (i.e. they are not cherry-picking)8. IDRA and MDA wanted more than cutaneous lesions because they want to apply this treatment to other tumor types (again, no cherry-picking and looking ahead).9. Intra-tumoral injection is about as safe as needle biopsy (so it can be performed in non-academic settings if approved)10. Adverse events from 2125 are basically flu-like symptoms. More serious ones are consistent with ipi.11. Responses deepen over time. Diab expects some to convert from SD to PR, etc."
"IDRA managed to get rid of that humiliating 1-handle this week. It’s a start.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA started the week riding a strong sector Monday to gain over 7%. After that, it held its own, alternating red and green days for the rest of the week. In the end, the stock gained back 10 of the 43 cents it lost last week, resulting in a 5.03% gain. The closing price was a more palatable $2.09. For 2020, the stock’s performance improved from a gain of 9.34% to 14.8%.The broader market did provide some tail wind. The NAS was green, AGAIN, to the tune of 2.47%, and closed above 11,000 on the week for the first time ever. Its 2020 gain is now at 22.7%, a year’s worth of gains in just over seven months.The DOW was really the life of the party, gaining 3.8%. I talk about BA a lot, but it’s merited. This week, the stock gained a tidy 7.6% to support the index. Why is the index still red by 3.87% on the year? Look no further than BA, which has lost 47.8% since New Year’s. My bio indexes were varying shades of green. The BTK was a very light green with a gain of 0.35%; the IBB was slightly greener, up 1.38%; the XBI was a beautiful emerald, surging 4.2%. The XLV was more of a milky emerald, up 0.83%. Predictably, the VXX took it on the chin. This week, the volatility indicator was down every session. It closed the week down 6.9% at $26.53. I added to my position here Thursday. On 8/7/19, IDRA closed at $2.56. This is an easier comparison than last week, and combined with IDRA’s gain, the YoY deficit shrunk from 26.3% to 18.4%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.98-2.15T 2.00-2.14W 1.90-2.15Th 2.00-2.13F 1.99-2.15 And from last week:M 2.25-2.45T 2.06-2.32W 1.92-2.17Th 1.91-2.03F 1.93-2.00It was nice to see IDRA regain some dignity this week. I’m really not worried about the stock. Tilso continues to impress in the clinic, which is the ONLY battle that matters right now. I see it eventually becoming, for certain types of tumors, part of a “cocktail” of treatments used to enhance the effectiveness of the other medications.If and when that happens, the value will be apparent, and either IDRA will rise steadily as it gains market share, or there will be a nice buyout that results in an earlier payday for the long suffering longs here.In the meantime, I am concerned about the market, which clearly appears inflated (and I’m not the only one saying it). The country has a pandemic that continues to produce new hot spots; unemployment is over 10%; and companies have seriously lowered earnings estimates. And yet the NAS closes over 11K for the first time. I think heard an announcer on CNBC yesterday, saying the NAS has set a record high 40 times this year. (It might have been 20. The point is the same.)So…it’s all feeling a bit like a house of cards. If that house falls, a stock like IDRA, with no product on the market, will likely be among the carnage.If that happens, we’ll need to keep our eyes on the prize. The fact remains that market cap is often not a measure of a company’s value. When it comes to pharma development, the market acts like it’s from Missouri: you have to SHOW it before the value comes.But the market cap will come, provided the product continues to impress. Hold on during the dips, and add if you can. This is when we earn our money.Sarge"
"IDRA was handing out smiles to its shareholders yesterday. They were well deserved (the smiles), and we deserve more.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA broke out a bit this week, rising 90 cents or 33.7% to close at $3.57. For 2019, IDRA made it green in a big way, and the gain is at 28.9%. The sector was mixed. It took a gain of 1.58% on Friday to take the NAS green this week, but only by 0.2%. Still, it extended a weekly green streak. For 2019, the index is now green by 23% (last time I posted this tally 3 weeks back, the year’s gain was at 19.6%). My bio indicators all hovered around breakeven, plus or minus: the BTK was up by 0.25% (again bolstered by a large gain on Friday); the IBB was slightly better, up 0.47%; the XBI was Worst of Breed, but the loss was only 1.18%. The XLV was Best of Breed (and when did that last happen?), up 1.29%. Though the DOW gained .75% yesterday, it wasn’t enough to make up for the prior losses in the week, and the index lost 0.14%. For 2019, it is now up 13.6%. That’s a LOT for the beginning of May.On 5/3/18, IDRA closed at $13.04 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down to 72.6%. That’ll keep you humble.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.63-3.01T 2.98-3.32W 2.84-3.04Th 2.85-3.08 F 3.04-3.87 And from last week:M 2.25-2.37T 2.34-2.59W 2.57-2.75Th 2.61-2.72 F 2.57-2.72This was an interesting week for IDRA. Of course, as a long, I always find it interesting when my stock gains over 10% twice in a week. Especially when there are no big losses to even the score.I took a look at noon on Tuesday, and was pleased to see the stock was at about $3.25. As that’s at the top end of the trading range, I considered selling a couple hundred shares just for fun, in case it went right down. But I got busy and missed my chance, and the price tailed off a bit before the day ended. The next day was red and I thought the price might drift down a bit.Then Friday, after the earnings report, the stock shot up again, on huge volume – over 5 times recent average trading. And it traded as high as $3.87, a level we haven’t seen since…Jan. 7.I just casually mentioned that the gain came “after the earnings report”. This is significant. IDRA has no product; its earnings reports are usually a tally of how much has been spent and how much is left in the bank (aka how long before dilution) – not a cause for celebration. Usually it’s a time where we hunker down and hope nobody notices how much cash we’re hemorrhaging.But not yesterday. I was most impressed by this rarity: IDRA actually EXTENDED the time frame for how long its cash will last, by a quarter. I don’t know how often this happens, but I don’t think it’s very often at all, without some outside stimulus.No, this was management utilizing its resources with intelligence, using the ATM to advantage, and pointing to a $1.5 million payment soon, for use of a non-core IDRA asset. I believe the cash burn rate shrank, too. This was likely not lost on the market.Yes, as my friend @Alridge95 astutely (as always) pointed out, the Bakers DID exercise warrants, Above Market Price, and the money came directly to IDRA. Way to take one for the team, Bakers! This had to have the primary effect on the market.But the finances were a factor, I have to believe. It’s a bit of inside football, but analysts are sensitive to this kind of stuff. We’ll see if this rare display of financial autonomy will impress someone enough to initiate coverage. Then maybe we’ll see another 10% gain. Take a look at a 6-month chart. We still have some ground to make up!SargeP.S. It needs to be mentioned. Major indexes are WAY up, showing gains you’d be proud of for a year, in early May. This cannot last. I suspect the market will give back a bit relatively soon."
"The last 3 bounces to new highs were separated by gaps of 16, 13, and 13 days respectively. The stock hit a high---so far---today of $5.50 which is a bounce off yesterday's low of $3.84 of 43%. That is slightly larger than the last bounce of 42% 2 weeks ago. Since 11/4 the stock has had 3 drops and 3 large, rapid rallies back to new highs. This is a very bullish sign and strong indicator that the stock should continue to hit new highs, and I believe the drops will be smaller and the new highs will come at a more rapid clip over the next 4-8 weeks as the stock rises to an equilibrium level leading into the data release. The $2's are gone and will not return. The $3's might, but the chances are becoming more remote. When the stock is in the $8's in a few weeks people are still going to have the same dilemna they do now----do you buy the stock at a higher level because it is going up, or do you try to wait for a drop? Well, if you're going to be doing that in the $8's, wouldn't it make sense to buy it in the $4's or $5's and not have to face that decision? IDRA is heading higher. It is a developmental biotech with a critical readout on their first pivotal P3 trial coming up soon. It also looks to have a willing potential partner in BMY who just shelled out billions to buy Celgene and is facing tremendous competition from Merck. More variables are positive now than ever before. Now we wait for the data-----which I do expect to be very similar to the earlier trials, which would still give tilso the best-in-class therapy in combination treatment for melanoma(to start), and give patients additional hope and another key weapon in the treatment arsenal."
"IDRA is acting distinctly different from the way it used to following a rally. confidence was low after the stock broke above $3, but it held and moved higher. Now after breaking $4, and convincingly, nearly hitting $5 it looked like the stock might swoon and turn lower. It did, but just to consolidate following such a strong move higher. Now more strength with decent volume for black friday and another nice move to the mid $4's. This is very bullish heading into the end of the year---and an upcoming administration change where the new president has sworn to defeat cancer. There were a lot of things this year that we would like to forget. I think we will be able to add the historic lows IDRA saw to that list, and next year will be the best one for IDRA shareholders in quite a while."
"Rainman was curious about ESMO 2020 results:ILLUMINATE-204BackgroundTilsotolimod (IMO-2125), an investigational Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, activates innate and adaptive immune responses and rapidly upregulates Type I IFN and dendritic cell activation following intratumoral injection. ILLUMINATE-204 was a phase 1/2 study of tilsotolimod with ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma following progression on or after anti-PD-1 therapy.MethodsAdults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma that progressed on or after a PD-1 inhibitor, an accessible tumor for intratumoral administration of tilsotolimod, and ≤ 2 lines of prior therapy (≤ 3 if BRAF-mutant) were eligible. Prior ipilimumab was allowed. Tilsotolimod was administered to a single tumor during weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11; ipilimumab was administered per the product label. The primary objective of the phase II portion was to assess preliminary clinical activity at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).ResultsA total of 62 patients were treated with tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab. Of these, 52 received the RP2D of 8 mg, and 49 were evaluable for efficacy. The median OS was 21.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.8 - not reached [NR]), and the overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 was 22.4% (95% CI: 11.8 - 36.6), including 2 complete responses. Median duration of response was 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.3 - NR) with 7/11 responses lasting ≥ 6 months. The disease control rate was 71.4% (95% CI: 56.7 - 83.4). Tumor reduction was observed in injected and non-injected lesions. Analysis of biopsies showed rapid local IFNα gene expression, dendritic cell maturation, and expansion of shared CD8+ T cell clones in injected and non-injected tumors. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed in 48% (30/62) of patients, most commonly increased ALT and AST and colitis, and 26% experienced immune-related AEs. No AEs led to treatment discontinuation or death.ConclusionsTilsotolimod with ipilimumab was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated efficacy in anti-PD-1-refractory advanced melanoma. Activity was observed in injected and non-injected lesions. A phase III study of this combination compared with ipilimumab alone (ILLUMINATE-301; NCT03445533) is ongoing.------------------------------ILLUMINATE-101BackgroundThe ILLUMINATE-101 phase Ib study (NCT03052205) explored the safety, efficacy, and immune effects of intratumoral tilsotolimod, an investigational Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, in multiple solid tumors.MethodsAdults with cancer not amenable to curative therapies received intratumoral tilsotolimod 8, 16, 23, or 32 mg into a single lesion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent 3-week cycle, for up to 17 cycles with a primary objective to characterize safety. Additional patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled at the RP2D of 8 mg with the primary objective of efficacy assessment. Blood samples and tumor biopsies of injected lesions were obtained at baseline and 24 hours post treatment for immune analyses.ResultsA total of 54 patients were enrolled. The 38 patients in the dose escalation cohort had a median of 7 prior lines of treatment, 35 had metastatic disease, and the most common cancer types were pancreatic (n=12) and colorectal (n=7). All 16 patients in the melanoma cohort had metastatic disease, and 10 had elevated LDH. Injected lesions were deep and required interventional radiology in 52 of 54 patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common treatment-related adverse events were pyrexia, fatigue, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Biopsies of injected tumors at 24 hours showed increased activation of the Type I IFN pathway, upregulation of MHC class I/II, IFNγ expression, and expression of multiple immune checkpoints (i.e. PD-1, LAG3). Of the 35 evaluable patients in the dose escalation cohort, 12 (34%) achieved a best overall response of stable disease (SD). In the melanoma cohort (N=16), 3 patients had SD, 1 who had a 35% tumor reduction with no confirmatory scan.ConclusionsTilsotolimod was generally well tolerated and induced alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including immune checkpoint upregulation, activation of dendritic cells, and induction of Type I IFN signaling. Additional clinical studies of tilsotolimod in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are underway (NCT03445533, NCT03865082, and NCT02644967)."
"PR is out.... pretty encouraging for mono therapy...In the poster presentation entitled, “Activation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity Using Intratumoral Tilsotolimod (IMO-2125) as Monotherapy in Patients with Refractory Solid Tumors: a Phase 1b Study (ILLUMINATE-101)” (abstract number 4062), Hani Babiker, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine and Associate Director of the Phase 1 Program at the University of Arizona Cancer Center, presented results from this study.“Tilsotolimod’s therapeutic mission is to alter the immune conditions within the tumor microenvironment to help provide more favorable conditions for checkpoint inhibitors to help achieve successful outcomes for patients,” stated Dr. Babiker. “We typically would not expect to see substantial tumor reduction with tilsotolimod monotherapy; however, it is highly encouraging to see the number and duration of stable diseases, including some with tumor reductions, from this study across a wide spectrum of difficult-to-treat refractory solid tumor types. The finding from this study bodes well for both the ILLUMINATE-301 Phase 3 trial and the upcoming ILLUMINATE-206 trial of tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab in multiple planned tumor types, including those that have not responded favorably to immunotherapy to date.”"
"IDRA made a little progress this week. And there was an encouraging sign. Of course, we’ll see if it lasts.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA ended green for the week, for the first time since January 4. Gaining 4 days out of 5, the stock climbed 19 cents or 7.72% to close at $2.65. This put a little distance between the current price and the low of $2.25 that was established on January 24. For 2019, IDRA is dragging itself in the direction of respectability with a loss of 4.33%. The sector had a very good week. The NAS gained 2.39%, bringing its 2019 gain up to 12.6%. My bio indicators, though, made the NAS look like a slacker: the BTK surged 4.45%; the IBB was up 3.93%; the XBI was even better, charging 4.73%. The XLV was respectably impressive as well, up 3.24%. The DOW moved like a younger index, gaining 3.09%. On the year, the gain is now 10.96%. This is pretty heady stuff, but some remember that the market jumped out of the gate the first 2 months of last year as well. On 2/15/18, IDRA closed at $15.28 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is 82.6%. Which is awful. But it’s better than last week!Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.40-2.65T 2.46-2.70W 2.70-2.86Th 2.61-2.80 F 2.61-2.73And from last week:M 2.53-2.67T 2.48-2.65W 2.48-2.65Th 2.42-2.60 F 2.45-2.56So…IDRA has been a little discouraging of late for long investors. Ok, a lot discouraging. And dwelling on this can be down right depressing. Right now, if a fellow long was tempted to look at a one-year chart, I’d say, “let’s hold off for a while”.But there are signs of life. This week, IDRA was green 3 sessions in a row, which I have come to accept as a bullish sign. Do you know the last time IDRA had at least 3 green sessions in a row? The four trading days that ended on November 26. In the 50 sessions between those streaks, IDRA was red 34 times.There’s more. This week, on Wednesday, the stock closed at $2.77. This was the highest close in almost a month; the last higher close was at $2.93 on January 18. Near term, my next goal is that the stock price surpass the recent trading high of $2.90 set on January 30.The stock really has dug itself into a hole. Last week, as I was preparing my weekly summary, I calculated how much the stock would have to gain just to get a 3-handle. At that time, with a Friday closing price of $2.46, that would have taken a gain of 21.9%. After this week’s gain, the distance to $3.00 is down to 13.2%.Of course, assuming we hit the milestone of 3 bucks, it’s still another 33.3% before hitting the border of Quad country. We are down there, aren’t we?But the cliché is true: the longest journey begins with one step. This week, we took 3 in a row. The trial results will come out soon and hopefully give the stock price a boost. I do believe that time is truly on our side with Tilso, as after the ONE TREATMENT, patients tend to continue to get better as time goes by.Maybe, just maybe, @Gold will be right, and IDRA will bounce up as quickly as it bounced down. It can happen. After all, the consensus one-year price for analysts covering the stock is $17.00. I hear that neighborhood is even swankier than Quad country…Sarge"
"IDRA is not the Comeback Kid every week, apparently. Can we blame options expiration?Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA was looking good heading into Friday, up 5.6% on the week. But Friday, the stock didn’t trade green all day, closing the day down 9.38%. The stock closed the week down 19 cents (4.28%) at $4.25. For the year, the gain is still 133.5%. The broader market provided great support that was not appreciated locally. The NAS surged another 3.05%, to bring its gain on the year to….42.16%. This is getting historic, folks. Especially when you combine it with last year.The DOW was also green, but much less impressively, with a gain of 0.45%. The calendar year gain is now 5.75%.BA made it 2 red weeks in a row, falling 4.59%. The year’s deficit rose from 29.3% to 32.5%.My bio indexes also cannot be blamed for lack of support. The BTK gained over 3.4% on Monday and never looked back, up 6.79% for the week; the IBB, was overshadowed, though it was up 3.7%; the XBI won local bragging rights, nosing out the IBB by gaining 3.71%. The XLV didn’t win, place or show, up 1.19%. The VXX went back to its losing ways, tumbling 97 cents or 5.39 to close at $17.03.On 12/18/19, IDRA closed at $1.50. The YoY gain actually rose from 171% to 183.3%. Ok!Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 3.95-4.56T 3.83-4.28W 4.38-5.50Th 4.55-4.97F 4.22-4.67 And from last week:M 4.71-5.00T 4.71-5.18W 4.62-5.08Th 4.15-4.74F 4.35-4.68Do you like ping pong? I like ping pong. But I do NOT like it when my stock’s price acts like a ping pong ball.Wednesday was great for IDRA. The price was green all day, and at one point in the morning, a trade of about 45,000 shares spiked the price up to a new trading high of $5.50, eclipsing the prior high of $5.37 set nine sessions earlier, on 12/3.That was fun, and like I said, things looked good as we rounded the corner to the final session of the week.It WAS options expiration day, and weird things DO tend to happen on such days. But I’m not sure the expiration had much to do with IDRA yesterday.Because the volume wasn’t very high. It was a little higher than average, but not much. By contrast, the other stock I write about, SPPI, had volume about four times average levels as it tanked on Friday, capped by a HUGE trade (4 million shares, over twice an average day) to close at the low.IDRA did not provide anything nearly so dramatic. So I’m not sure if there’s a correlation.Frankly, all I know about options is to remember to cringe on the days they expire. Anyone with actual KNOWLEDGE on how they can affect share price – and if they did so here yesterday – is most welcome to chime in.For now, I’ll say it’s the options, and look forward to a green Monday.Sarge"
"One recurrent theme regarding melanoma at the recent ESMO 2019 meeting is that Ipi + Nivo improved long-term survival significantly over either agent alone. The side effects as in previous studies were higher, but manageable and did not result in a high number of patients stopping therapy. In fact EVEN if the patient had to stop therapy the benefit of the combination was felt long-term and resulted in improved survival without the need for additional therapies (rescue/salvage). This falls into the one cycle and done concept that IDRA has promoted with Tilso. That is patients, though perhaps not ""cured"", can go on with their lives without returning to the hospital/clinics for multiple visits/treatments/procedures. I see a trend that SD is taking on a more important role than in years past where the only attention was given to PR and CR. It also follows the trend of de-emphasizing ORR alone. Since Tilso has had good results with virtually all the approved CPIs pre-clinically and at least with Ipi so far clinically, it stands to reason that the ability to further enhance the tumor microenvironment with a relatively easy intratumoral injection near the time of CPI treatment, could play right in to the current trend for treating Stage III/IV metastatic melanoma without adding complexity or toxicity to the regimen. The additional abscopal effect may in fact improve outcomes greatly over current therapies. Revving up the immune system and creating tumor fighting memory on a prolonged basis should result in sustained periods where patients can forget about their cancer even if not ""cured"". This is a concept that I see becoming the new norm as quality of life issues and less expensive, less toxic, and less invasive end-of-life treatments gain momentum. Tilso seems to fit right in to these concepts. Maybe we will even (eventually) make some money along the way."
"Quad Country never looked so good.Let’s look at the numbers. Last week, IDRA closed the year with a thud. This week was a whole different story. The stock started by gaining 9,54% on Monday, and never looked back.Green 4 of 5 sessions, the stock gained 59 cents or 16% to close the first week of 2021 at $4.28. For this week only, the weekly gain is also its score for the year.The broader market and sector provided a strong foundation of support. The NAS started its year right where it left off, gaining a solid 2.8% in spite of some troubling events in the political world. As a long investor, I’ll take it.The DOW also started 2021 with a jump out of the gate, gaining 2.27%. It keeps setting new all-time highs.BA finally got to start with a clean slate after a disastrous year. Unfortunately, in true Jim Ryun style, it stumbled out of the gate with a loss of 1.64%.My bio indexes snapped right back after ending the year in woeful fashion. The BTK set a high bar with a gain of 4.26%; the IBB was not to be outdone, up 5.12%; the XBI, which does exaggerate Everything, shot up 5.98%. The XLV was also in on the party, up 4.47%.The VXX had an impressive day Monday, but was red the rest of the week. At Friday’s close, it completed its 4th red week in a row, down 2.27% at $16.35..On January 8, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.75. The YoY comparison therefore starts off with a heady gain of 144.6%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 3.52-4.02T 3.90-4.13W 3.88-4.04Th 4.00-4.13F 4.02-4.40And from last week:M 4.05-4.40T 3.76-4.15W 3.81-4.16Th 3.63-4.17F New Year’s DayI must admit I was disappointed at the way IDRA’s stock price closed the year last week. But this week, it gained back all of last week’s losses and then some.I also admit I rounded up just a fraction in giving the stock a 16% gain on the week. It was actually 15.989%. Call me a wild-eyed optimist.But as I said last week, I AM optimistic about IDRA, right now. Trial results are imminent, and we might just see some impressive numbers. If we do, we won’t have to worry about dropping out of Quad Country for a very long time.Last night, on another thread here, I challenged my friend @Brian to pick some music for today. My choice is The Marmalade, with Reflections of my Life. After all the strife in DC this week, I thought it was fitting.Since we had been talking about The Who, I had considered picking “I’m Free” from Tommy. But I’ll hold that in reserve for when trial results come out.Have a good weekend, everyone. Life will settle down again, not too long from now.Sargehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqUDRkO93DA"
"Excerpt from Biocryst ER call; Jon Stonehouse, CEO, talking about 2125 and money: ""And then there are a couple of other things that Idera is working on, that could bring in additional capital. All together, that's somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million range roughly. And then the longer term is what we've talked about before, where it's really clear that 2125 to really be able to take advantage of using it in a number of different tumor types requires the financial strength of a much bigger player. And so there is an interest level from strategic players in this space, and we remain confident that there could be a license deal that could bring in both an upfront payment and milestones that we think could be substantial in helping fund the future of the company.""Another excerpt from Chief Medical Officer:""Sure. My understanding is that there will be an update of the 2125 plus ipilimumab of their ongoing Phase II experiment in melanoma. And they had an impressive response rate. So an update on the response rate and the durability of responses are the key items. I think that our review, we were pretty satisfied that the safety profile of the combination is similar to the safety profile of ipilimumab alone. And that progress on that study is going to be a really interesting to see. I think in the market research that Lynne and their team independently at the time that we did our diligence, the oncology community feedback was very clear that a response rate in people who have failed already a checkpoint inhibitor of about double the response rate you would get alone, which is (inaudible) would be very impressive. And we value the asset, taking that into account, with an overall response rate of 30%, which is a lot lower than they initially saw in the original presentation. So I think they're the main things that we'll be looking forward to seeing an update on.""I believe the inaudible number, if I'm not mistaken, is around 13%."
"The word for today is “swanky”.Let’s look at the numbers. After two red weeks, IDRA was positive from Tuesday on, gaining 24 cents or 8.76% to close at $2.98. Tantalizingly close to a 3-handle. Swanky!For 2019, IDRA has sprung back to green, with a 7.58% gain. The sector seems to be in a see-saw pattern, and this was a week when things were looking up. The NAS set a new 2019 high, charging 3.78% and bringing the year’s gain up to an impressive 15.9%. My bio indicators were happy to join the fray: the BTK led the way, gaining 5.87%; the IBB impressed, adding 5.15%; the XBI was even more impressive, surging 5.56%. The XLV had a week that would be noteworthy most any other time, rising 2.89%. The DOW managed a gain despite Boeing’s best efforts to the contrary, up 1.56%. For 2019, the index is up 10.8%. On 3/15/18, IDRA closed at $15.60 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now at 80.9%. Amazingly, this is an improvement.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.67-2.81T 2.68-2.81W 2.67-2.94Th 2.78-2.92 F 2.80-3.00And from last week:M 2.70-2.93T 2.77-2.88W 2.57-2.84Th 2.45-2.84 F 2.66-2.80The poster @Rain asked last night for projections as to the potential of IDRA. I’ll try and give some perspective.First, if you haven’t already, give a listen to Wednesday’s Barclay’s presentation. A stock price will not rise if the company’s product has no value. Take a look and a listen, and re-assess – again – whether you think Tilso is worth pursuing. If the answer is no, you should start making exit plans right now.In terms of value, I’d encourage folks here to think in terms of market cap rather than stock price. E-Trade says the market cap for IDRA is only $80.7 million. There are 27.6 million shares outstanding. As much as I resented the RS, that’s a pretty low number of available shares for a drug development company, which gives the company some flexibility to raise cash (the dreaded ATM!).IDRA’s market cap is miniscule. During the presentation, Vince brought up his great success, ViroPharma, which was a rare disease company. They built it to a point where it was acquired for $4 billion. I did the math. $4 billion divided by 80 million (IDRA shares) is 50. Would you agree to a sales price of $149 per share? Because that’s 50 times the current IDRA share price.My greatest success in the market so far is Avanir. It was a company with one drug on the market, Nuedexta. This was a combination of two old generic drugs, Quinidine and Dextromethorphan, which helped patients who had a various of diseases or challenges (ALS, MS, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, to name a few) have fewer episodes of inappropriate emotional reactions (laughing at a funeral, for example).The drug worked; the challenge was to find the patients, as the inappropriate emotional responses tended to isolate those patients.In the meantime, the drug was being tested for other applications. Early on, the president of the company had referred to the drug as, potentially, the “aspirin for Neurology”, as it temporarily heals lesions in the brain.I held that stock for over a decade, with very little encouragement from the market. But when it happened, it seemed to happen all at once. I had bought shares at $1 for what seemed like an eternity. Ultimately, the company sold for $17 per share. At the time of the sale, the 52-week low price for the stock was $3.02.Read that again. $3.02, and in a matter of months, a sale at $17.00.But it happened in stages. As I recall, the real struggle was getting the stock from $1 to $2. After that, the next plateau for the stock price was around $5.00. The morning that a second application for Nuedexta was proven in trials, the stock jumped up from around $5 to about $12.00. The stock then drifted up to a $14 handle over the next few weeks, and one morning, they announced the sale at $17, which at the time was a premium of less than 20%.So it can happen, @Rain. The trick is to stick around even when there are the inevitable attacks on the stock price. The big reward ONLY comes to those who wait and hold. And wait.Sarge"
"In trying to decipher all the numbers in this announced private sale I get the following. I'm not saying my info is correct and I be interested in anybody's numbers that are different. Overall, if everything were to eventually play out under this announced private sale, I get a total new common shares after all conversions of 54-55 million additional shares. Added to the current Yahoo shares outstanding of around 29 million shares, then add a few for comp incentives over the next year or two, lets say that at the end of a couple of years the total share count would be around 85 million. Assuming continued success & progress with Tilso, for each market cap value of $1 billion realized it would at the 85 million share count level represent a per share value of around $11.75. How much market cap Tilso would actually be worth, again assuming success, I can't say, but $1 billion would certainly seem to be on the low side. If anyone has any other calculations please post them. Thanks."
"While this pop feels pretty good, my own view is that IDRA's PPS needs to rise further on the back of its own corporate/scientific developments before a potential buyout is a good idea. Partnership is different, and I would very much like to see a collaboration - on the right terms - sooner rather than later. But in terms of a purchase, the market cap of IDRA is so low right now that I think any offer that might be acceptable to IDRA and its shareholders might be too much of a multiple of the current market cap to make sense for a potential suitor. For example, if IDRA were sold for 500 million, which is a pretty small deal in the biotech space, that would represent about a 500% premium over the current price. I just don't see a big pharma doing that. Maybe I am wrong, but I would like to see IDRA get up to 350 - 600 million market cap on its own first. But it certainly is nice to see the market pay a little attention to it."

"It’s the dog days for IDRA, and you know what? It feels like it.Let’s see what the numbers show. After a couple of green weeks, IDRA gave some back, sliding 11 cents or 3.87% to close at $2.73. For the 2019 tally, the week took IDRA from green to red. Compared to the share price of $2.77 where we closed the last year, the stock is down 1.4%. Last week, this comparison was green by 2.53%. The market in general enjoyed a good week, with major indices near or setting all-time highs (compare this to about 4 weeks ago, when all looked so bleak!). The NAS surged 3.02%. Its 2019 gain, which had dipped to 12.3% four weeks ago, is now at 21%. My bio indicators all did themselves proud: the BTK was up 5.95%, an impressive showing any OTHER week of the year; the IBB was better, charging 6.13%; the XBI was best, soaring 7.08%. The XLV got the Participation Award, gaining 2.72%. The DOW has also made a comeback recently. This week, it was up 2.41%. The 2019 gain, down to 6.65% 4 weeks ago, is now up to 14.8%. This market is really Jeckyll and Hyde these days.On 6/21/18, IDRA closed at $11.76 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is down to 76.8%. Since the comparison number is getting much lower, this loss is not as bad as it has been. It was hovering around 83 or 84%. Still, all things considered, the comparison is still awful.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.78-3.04T 2.88-3.02W 2.83-2.99Th 2.65-2.93 F 2.63-2.82 And from last week:M 2.66-2.95T 2.83-3.07W 2.73-2.93Th 2.83-3.00 F 2.83-3.00This week was a little disappointing for IDRA. Monday’s news that Array was being purchased by Pfizer caused the sector to do everything but cartwheels. I do a Saturday Morning Post over at the SPPI board as well – that stock gained almost 10% that day.But not IDRA. No, apparently it was being punished, and not allowed to play with the other biotech stocks – or at least not to the same extent. On a day when the XBI surged 4.74%, IDRA “paced itself” with a gain of 3.87%. No need to get too excited around here.Then, even though the sector overall continued to post (more modest) gains in the second half of the week, IDRA dropped 7.8%.IDRA has been up and down like a ping pong ball of late. Looking back at it’s price action, I was surprised to recall that it was on May 6, less than a month and a half ago, that the stock closed at $3.97 (with a trading high of $4.19!). 8 sessions later, the stock closed at $2.52, a loss of 36.5%.The stock then hovered in the $2.50 range for about 3 weeks, finally getting some traction and closing at $2.64 on June 7, and $2.84 a week later. This week, we gave a little of that back.The problem is, the stock is range bound. And apparently, that range does not include spending a lot of time even next door to Quad country. And yes, that’s after an 8-for-1 RS. But here we'll remain until the next trial update.There’s been some talk of late here about what management can and can’t control. You know something they can’t control? The calendar. As far as I know, there is not a way to speed up the trials IDRA is going through for Tilso. The company has to go through the process, and while we wait, the market kicks around the stock price just for giggles. And long suffering long investors question….everything.It’s just the dog days. It’s the time when we truly EARN the gains that we all hope are on the horizon for this stock, and this company.Sarge"
"Here is the ESMO abstract:AbstractBackgroundTilsotolimod, a synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and has antitumor activity as monotherapy in preclinical models. In the ILLUMINATE-204 phase I/II study of tilsotolimod in combination with ipilimumab in patients with refractory melanoma, increased antitumor immune activity was observed in injected and uninjected tumors at 24 hours following tilsotolimod treatment. The ILLUMINATE-101 phase Ib study explored the safety, efficacy, and immune effects of tilsotolimod monotherapy in multiple solid tumors.MethodsAdults with histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer not amenable to curative therapies received intratumoral tilsotolimod in doses escalating from 8 mg to 32 mg into a single lesion at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11. Additional patients with advanced melanoma were enrolled into an expansion cohort at the 8-mg dose, the recommended phase II dose established for melanoma. Objectives included characterizing safety and efficacy, and immunological assessment. Blood samples and tumor biopsies of injected and distal lesions were obtained at baseline and 24 hours post treatment for immune analyses.ResultsAs of May 6 2019, 54 patients have been enrolled, including 38 patients into the dose evaluation portion and 16 patients into the melanoma expansion cohort. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fever, fatigue, and chills. Within 24 hours, fresh tumor biopsies showed increased gene expression for multiple immune checkpoint pathways, increased IFN gamma levels, activation of the type 1 IFN pathway, and upregulation of MHC class I and II, compared to pretreatment biopsies. Of 43 evaluable patients, 15 (35%) had a RECIST v1.1 disease assessment of stable disease (duration 1.2 to 11.1 months, 1 patient ongoing).ConclusionsTilsotolimod was well tolerated and induced robust alterations in the tumor microenvironment, including immune checkpoint upregulation, activation of dendritic cells, and induction of Type 1 IFN signaling. A phase II study of tilsotolimod in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab has been initiated for the treatment of multiple solid tumors (ILLUMINATE-206; NCT03865082)."
"Happy Saturday, IDRA fans. I won't be posting a weekend summary (again), as today I have an important out-of-town gig: watching a daughter graduate.The good news is, none of us will have to dissect the depressing numbers. I have done some trading in the stock, and will report the details upon my return. Sarge"
"I think the price of IDRA is likely to continue to climb into year end. Since the stock is doing a little better, and has actually risen this year, the traditional end of year tax loss selling will not drop the stock. No losses to take this year so we could see a nice end-of year accumulation leading into data release next year."
"If you take the 13F filings and add in the 13D's (Julian Baker and Pillar) and 13G (Merck and Co), you end up with just over 106 million shares owned by 13D/F/G filers, which is 54.35% institutional ownership based on 195,640,000 shares outstanding."
"Tell me if you think this is a coincidence. On January 4th when the stock last bottomed the RSI was at 48.75--very neutral. But the fast stochastic indicating overbought/oversold was all the way down to 12.58--VERY oversold. On Friday when the stock bottomed the RSI was 48.93--virtually the same as 1/4, and very neutral. The fast stochastic was at 12.4!! The readings are virtually identical. Let me tell you what happened after the stock bottomed on Jan 4th. 10 days later it was 60% HIGHER! This is NOT a coincidence. The market and individual stocks follow patterns at certain times. IDRA has been following the same pattern now for 4 months--since October. Market makers, traders, AND savvy investors use these metrics and patterns to their advantage. Unfortunately the average individual investor does the opposite of what the professionals do most of the time. When the stock is down they tend to lose confidence and-----SELL. Then the stock starts rising and they wait for what they think is ""confirmation"" and buy much higher than they could have. And while many people are profiting that bought near the bottom and the stock starts selling off and dropping, the average investor waits until the stock has dropped quite a bit before----selling at or near the bottom AGAIN! Patterns are essential and a beneficial aid to making investing decisions. Now that the price and trading volume have both increased with IDRA the patterns carry more weight and relevance. They are not rock-solid and absolutely specific with the timing, but generally are a very close timing indicator of trend reversals. The stock is definitely very close to a reversal point, and there is still lots of time before the release of the data for another major round or two of buying leading into the readout. Just my observations FWIW."
I agree with Tursta that the price movement in Idera is a ploy to shake retail resolve. I’ve said numerous times I believe the Bakers have the merger under control and it is happening. Our focus should be on how the new combined company is going to be perceived and valued by the market. What will the new company be worth if it hits on 2125 and the HAE treatment?
"Let’s face it. Since the merger was announced a few weeks back, IDRA has had a rough go. But this week we saw a glimmer of light.Let’s look at the numbers. After going red 4 out of the last 6 weeks, IDRA gained 21 cents or 11.3% to close the week at $2.07.The sector shook off its recent worries and rose impressively. The NAS led the charge, surging 4.17%. The index renewed its impressive 2018 pace, with a total gain of 9.52%. My bio indicators were all bright green: the BTK rose 4.67%; the IBB was up 4.29%; the XBI set the pace with a gain of 4.88%. And the XLV, conservative though it is, ended the week ahead 3.43%. It seems like the talking heads were saying small caps were not hurt by the tariff panic, and this seems to bear that out.On 3/9/17, IDRA closed at $1.88. The YOY comparison is positive by 9.17%. YTD is still red. Having started the year at $2.11, IDRA’s 2018 loss is just 1.89%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.83 2.00T 1.90-2.00W 1.93-2.03Th 1.97-2.10 F 2.00-2.10And from last week:M 1.84 1.90T 1.77-1.86W 1.76-1.88Th 1.71-1.82 F 1.75-1.86The numbers show that IDRA has been strong of late. Candidly, I’d like to see more volume accompany a move like this, but we'll take what we can get. Start with the daily ranges from this week. The low for the day went up every day last week, and by Friday, the stock had a 2-handle all day. The last time that happened was January 23.The 3-month chart also looks like a bit of a breakout after our recent doldrums. It should – the stock has been green or even for the last 8 sessions in a row.Reality check: if you want to see how far the stock still has to go, take a look at a one-year chart. It will take a hefty percentage increase for the stock to continue its up-trend.Of course, the merger will change all this. I just looked at a one-year chart for BCRX, which is no picnic, either. But it’s been basing for almost that whole year, and looks poised to rise. I know IDRA shareholders are getting one share of the new company for every 5 they currently hold. Does anyone know if it will be traded under the BCRX symbol? I haven’t looked into that part too closely.At any rate, it’s the usual waiting game for IDRA, as it is for any drug development company. When we get a week like this, it’s best to celebrate while we can.Sarge"
"The tree shaketh a little, sometimes.Let’s look at the numbers. While the sector threw a party, IDRA, in true pandemic fashion, stayed home with the shades pulled. It just wasn’t IDRA’s week. Monday sums it up. The NAS gained 2.55%, and the XBI surged 4.4%. Meanwhile, our favorite stock lost 8 cents. Frankly, I think the stock was due for a pause, and we should feel lucky the market wasn’t down, or the damage could have been worse.In the end, IDRA lost 32 cents or 5.72% to close at $5.27. YTD, the stock is still up a robust 42.8%.The broader market was remarkably supportive, as several indexes set all-time highs. The NAS led the way, surging 6.01%. Its gain for 2021 rose from 1.77% to 7.89%. Not bad for 5 weeks.The DOW also had a stellar week, climbing 3.89%, and changing its status on the year from a loss of 1.39% to a gain of 2.43%. BA finally found some traction after some struggles. This week, it gained back 7.07%, shrinking its loss on the year from 8.99% to 2.56%.My bio indexes put on a fireworks display. The BTK gained 4.23%, which would have gotten headlines any other week; the IBB made the BTK look like yesterday’s beans, however, charging 5.23%; and THAT would have been impressive had the XBI not gained 9.09%! The XLV showed that this party was for small caps only, shuffling forward 0.56%. While everyone else was smiling, the VXX got served with papers. As the market charged, it plunged, tumbling 21.9% to $16.47.On February 5, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.68. The YoY gain remains a stunning 213.7%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 5.36-5.70T 5.30-5.71W 5.30-5.73Th 5.26-5.68F 5.20-5.60And from last week:M 5.70-6.10T 5.35-6.09W 5.26-5.94Th 5.27-5.69F 5.50-6.12IDRA is going to do great things. That’s our mantra.Investing is, frankly, often demoralizing. IMO, to be successful, one has to fight the most basic human instincts.Buy low, and sell high. Talk about easier said than done!As @Andy has pointed out, the Bakers have a large stake in IDRA. They have an incredibly successful track record. Do we think THEY sell the stock when the price goes down? Not if the fundamentals haven’t changed. If that’s the case, they’re adding.Right now, we’re awaiting trial results. The company can’t give us a preview – we ALL have to wait until the results are posted. What happens while we wait? Wild speculation.It’s human nature. Flee danger; run toward safety and, hopefully, prosperity.IDRA traded to a high of $6.14 on Jan. 21. Yesterday, it traded to a low of $5.20, a correction of 15.3%. So the stock can go up now…any time is fine by me.What if it doesn’t? What if the market is not as friendly as this week was, and we still have no news? IDRA could conceivably go down further.IDRA could even (gasp!) get down to a 4-handle. What would things look like then?A little panicky, I’d say. Plus, some vermin would appear around here, predicting the demise of the stock, the company, and civilization as we know it.What should we do then?I propose, if the stock gets a 4-handle, we each buy 20 shares. The cost would be less than a hundred bucks, plus commission.The stock might go down further after that. Because the market IS that nasty. But I’ll say this: in not too much time, we’ll be proud of that purchase. And, that pride will only grow over time.Mull it over. Hopefully the stock will shoot up Monday, and this will all be academic. But if it doesn’t, I have a plan.Sarge"
"IDRA gained 50% this week. How’s that for a headline?Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA took a little pause last week, and Monday was more of the same, with the stock losing 2.8%.But the next 4 sessions were just spectacular, as the stock gained 8.33%, 11.37%, 7.8% and 18.66%. The stock set 52-week closing highs on 3 straight sessions, and 52-week trading highs Thursday and Friday. In the end, the stock closed the week up $1.32 or 50% at $4.26. For the calendar year, the stock is now up 134.1%. Can I get an Amen?The broader market was mixed. The NAS clawed its way back to green, up by 0.22%. The index’s gain on the year rose from 31.8% to 32.1%. The DOW was a slight laggard, sliding 0.73%. The calendar year’s gain shrunk from 3.29% to 2.54%.BA did not let the DOW down, as its 737 was finally approved for flight again. It ended the week up 6.69%, but that was not enough to overcome the red from the rest of the 30. For the year, it’s still red by 38.7%.My bio indexes were also mixed. The BTK led the way down, off 2.88%; the IBB was not as bad, down 1.55%; the XBI managed to go green, by 0.8%. The XLV was back of the pack, down 2.96%. The VXX could not get off the mat this week. This makes it 3 red weeks in a row, as it lost 2.52%, closing at $19.08.On 11/20/19, IDRA closed at $2.00. This friendly comparison means the YoY gain improved from 35.9%...to 113%!Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.63-2.87T 2.76-3.04W 3.01-3.43Th 3.36-3.70F 3.59-4.90 And from last week:M 2.84-3.32T 2.67-3.04W 2.80-2.92Th 2.74-2.92F 2.73-2.85As Sherlock Holmes would say, the game’s afoot!The volume tells the story. In recent weeks, average daily volume for IDRA had crept up to around 250k. It’s really been a lightly traded stock, and it’s not been uncommon for the total volume in a given day to be well under 100k.That changed Friday, when the volume was 1.85 million. That’s SEVEN TIMES recent averages. It’s also, clearly, not retail buying.Why? My thinking is that some fund or investor is taking a position in the stock. Our friend the respected @Tursta has opined that it might be leading up to some form of public or private offering, as the company only has cash to last until February. His points make sense.Some of my old friends here have been grumbling a bit about how the stock’s big gains are not so big, due to the 8-for-1 reverse split that happened a while back. I get that, but that RS left the company with only 35.3M outstanding shares. So if there’s buying, there just aren’t a lot of shares to go around. We’ve seen the result.I think, even if the “D” word rears its ugly head (dilution), it won’t be much more than a pause on the way up for this stock.Because revenue is coming. Tilso seems poised to become part of the first line of treatment for more than one type of tumor. That means serious revenue. And remember, the market cap currently sits at a tidy $150.2M.This stock has just begun to run.Sarge"
"I don't know what to make of the SP volatility over the last 4 or 5 days. The volume really picked up after IDRA announced it had a deal with BMS to supply ipi and nivo for the next trials in Head/Neck and CRC. Maybe somebody got excited about that and thought it meant that BMS was getting a lot more cozy with IDRA, but while that is true it seems a bit flimsy to me. However, if someone wanted to pick up a few hundred thousand shares then maybe they started on Wednesday of last week. The rather precipitous fall off today would support that theory as there seems to be only downward pressure on the SP. Either the volatility has spiked, which usually brings out the swing traders, which in turn begets more volatility."

"“It could be worse. Could be raining!” Name that movie!Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA made it five red weeks in a row, losing 2 cents or 0.79% to close at $2.52. For 2019, IDRA meandered slightly deeper into red territory. Compared to the share price of $2.77 on 12/31/18, the stock is down 9.03%. In fact, the market in general was pretty much undone by Friday. The NAS had a rare red week, giving back 1.18%, paring its 2019 gain to 22.8%. Which of course is nothing to sneeze at.My bio indicators were mixed: the BTK lost almost 2% Friday, but ended the week with a slight gain of 0.71%; the IBB could not withstand the onslaught, down 0.61%; the XBI was relatively unscathed, down 0.24%. The XLV was the relative laggard, down 0.74%. The DOW was basically flat this week, but in the end lost 0.65%. Its 2019 gain is now 16.7%. On 7/19/18, IDRA closed at $6.96 (split adjusted – and yes, this is a much better comparison). YoY, the loss is now “only” 63.8%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.45-2.55T 2.47-2.60W 2.53-2.65Th 2.53-2.64 F 2.52-2.61 And from last week:M 2.55-2.65T 2.50-2.60W 2.47-2.58Th 2.47-2.57 F 2.46-2.55It could be raining…the movie was Young Frankenstein, which came out in 1976 or 1977, and is still one of the funniest I’ve ever seen.The statement, though, is relevant to our stock right now. I track several stocks, some more closely than others. While things are boring and range bound here in Mudville, there are other stocks with charts that have truly broken down of late.Take a look at CHK, NVAX, and AKBA. All three of these stocks set 52-week lows this week, and if you look at their charts, it looks like the carnage is not yet over.So, we’re range bound. But I’d rather be bored than staring down a cliff.Watch closely. Do you have any hedge investments? I have a FEW shares of GOLD, and I enjoyed seeing it hit a 52-week high this week. I also have some VXX (the volatility index). That one is low right now, but if things get dicey, in these volatile times, it can shoot up in a hurry.We are living in historic times. The unpredictability in our market is going to increase before it decreases, so keep your eyes open for opportunities. Don’t sell in a panic. That’s when the Buffets of the world do their most cost-effective buying.Wait out the storm. Watch a comedy.Sarge"
"Hmmm....one wonders if IDRA is truly out of the antisense markets. See article below. Do you long time IDRA holders remember, this was once going to be our claim to fame?Antisense Therapeutics (ASX:ANP | US OTC:ATHJY), an Australian biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing antisense pharmaceuticals for unmet need in rare diseases announces a virtual poster presentation on the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Virtual 2020 Conference website.For 70 years MDA has been committed to transforming the lives of people living with muscular dystrophy, ALS, and related neuromuscular diseases. As the largest source of funding for neuromuscular disease research outside of the US federal government, MDA has committed more than $1 billion since its inception to accelerate the discovery of therapies and cures.The poster presentation includes the recently reported data from the Phase II clinical trial of the Company’s immunomodulatory therapy, ATL1102 for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) where ATL1102 met the primary endpoint of the study with confirmation of the drug’s safety and tolerability. ATL1102 also demonstrated strong effects on secondary endpoints including activity on the targeted CD49d immune cells consistent with the drug’s proposed mechanism of action and outcomes on disease progression parameters that exceeded the Company’s expectations with improvement or stabilisation across different measures of muscle function and strength. The positive effects on disease progression were further supported by MRI data that suggested a stabilisation in the percentage of fat in muscles and preservation of functional muscle mass.The Poster can be viewed on our website at the following link: Poster Presentation – Muscular Dystrophy Virtual Conference 2020Mark Diamond, Chief Executive Officer of Antisense Therapeutics said: ""Given the challenging times we are living in, MDA had to reimagine their annual conference and so have recently announced the launch of their 2020 MDA Virtual Conference Hub. Accordingly, we are very pleased that MDA have accepted our Phase II trial data for presentation. The Company is giving the clinical development of ATL1102 our highest priority. As we progress toward late stage clinical development, we intend to further increase international awareness of ATL1102’s therapeutic potential in boys suffering this terrible disease. The support of MDA and similarly oriented advocacy groups will greatly enhance attainment of that objective.""About Antisense Therapeutics is an Australian publicly-listed biotechnology company, developing and commercializing antisense pharmaceuticals for large unmet markets in rare diseases.

"IDRA ended the week exactly where it started. That doesn’t happen very often. Let’s look at the numbers. The stock’s action was fairly remarkable for its lack of movement. One down day, one up day, and 2 days where the stock didn’t change price at all. In each of the days where there was a price change, the stock moved 4 cents, and the stock ended the week right where it started at $1.83. The trading range for the week was from $1.74-$1.85, just 11 cents. For 2020, the stock remained up by one penny (0.55%).The broader market enjoyed a festive holiday-shortened week. The NAS set some records in the process of gaining 4.62%, sending its 2020 gain into “good enough for a whole year” territory at 13.76%.The DOW was also in on the fun, gaining 3.25%. Boeing again was a driver, with a solid 6.35% gain on the week. The DOW’s 2020 deficit was pared from 12.3% to 9.5%. The difference between the DOW and the NAS this year? You guessed it! Boeing, with a loss of 44.5% YTD.My bio indexes were also green, but this week looks to have been more of a large cap story. The BTK rose 1.92%; the IBB was better, gaining 2.5%; the XBI was an also-ran with a gain of 2.24%. The XLV took the Cup this week, surging 4.19%. The VXX, predictably, got clobbered, considering the gains all around. It closed Friday down $5.18 on the week at $32.32, a loss of 13.8%. On 7/3/19, IDRA closed at $2.60. This is a tougher comparison than last week by 2 cents, so the YoY deficit grew from 29.1% to 29.6%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.77-1.85T 1.78-1.85W 1.74-1.81Th 1.77-1.85F Holiday And from last week:M 1.88-1.96T 1.81-1.96W 1.84-1.94Th 1.82-1.93F 1.80-1.86IDRA truly seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting for a catalyst one way or the other. That was too bad this week. Last week, Cramer on CNBC said that historically, the last few sessions before the 4th of July are green about 75% of the time, and that played out this week. IDRA had really benign market conditions, and failed to take advantage of them.Cramer, btw, is a very smart guy. When it comes to things like the 4th of July phenomenon, he can be extremely insightful. But I tend not to rush to follow his advice on individual stocks. Back to IDRA. I believe in Tilso. I’m crazy about the abscopal effect, and think that because of it, Tilso may become an industry standard for many types of tumors that have spread to different parts of the body. But there’s a long way to go from here to there, and certainly we’re creeping up on the time where the dreaded D-word (dilution) will start coming up around here. And the trials are in relatively early stages, so a lot can go haywire between now and potential approval of the drug.So I’m sticking around. I am concerned about the virus that is spreading so quickly in so many parts of our country, and how it will affect the economy. While the market lows of March were hard to endure, technical analysts will tell you that such lows are often re-visited. If they are, it won’t be pretty around here.But if it gets that way, I’ll be a buyer. There is value here, and patience will be rewarded, in time.Sarge"
"It seems like 100 years ago, but IDRA resolved some serious uncertainty this week.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA made a big step in the right direction this week. The announcement Monday of the issuance of warrants to the Baker Bros. was greeted with a 24% gain, and the stock cruised to a weekly gain of 29 cents or 19.95%, closing at $1.82.The broader market was green, but the sector lagged. Old Reliable added another 0.92%, which bumped its yearly gain up to 35.7%. By all signs, the index will add to this gain in the final two days of the trading year.The DOW also ended green, up 0.67%, bringing its 2019 gain to 23.1%. My bio indexes took a pause after 4 straight green weeks: the BTK lost 1.22%; the IBB nudged down 0.4%; the XBI did slightly worse, down 0.48%. The conservative XLV managed a small gain of 0.23%. On 12/27/18, IDRA closed at $3.15. The YoY loss is now at 42.2%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.54-1.99T 1.86-1.99W ChristmasTh 1.85-1.96 F 1.75-1.86 And from last week:M 1.45-1.65T 1.45-1.60W 1.50-1.65Th 1.49-1.55 F 1.49-1.60 Last week, I tried to help encourage longs here, comparing what IDRA has gone through of late to what AUPH went through in October. Turns out my timing was pretty good, as we got news Monday of the new financing.Yes, it means dilution, but frankly, it’s not the dilution that hurts a stock price, but rather the anticipation of NEEDING to dilute. Now, that’s not a factor, at least for a long time.So we go back to the traditional practice of biting our nails on trial results. Time will tell. Hopefully, the stock will drift up a ways from here, and we’ll no longer be wondering about establishing new 52-weeks lows.Have a good, safe New Year’s, friends. Do what I do: don’t go anywhere you’ll have to drive.Sarge"
"Just posted on their website: IDERA TO RELEASE 2019 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS ON AUGUST 8, 2019EXTON, Pa., Aug. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Idera”) (NASDAQ: IDRA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, and ultimately the commercialization, of therapeutic drug candidates for both oncology and rare disease indications, today announced that second quarter results for 2019 are expected to be released on Thursday, August 8, 2019 before the opening of the U.S. financial markets.The company will host a conference call and live audio webcast at 10:00 A.M. eastern time on the same day.

The webcast can be accessed live or in archived form in the “Investors” section of the company’s website at www.iderapharma.com. Archived versions will also be available on the Company’s website after the event for 90 days."
So where does Idera go from here?
"It was the best of weeks, it was the worst of weeks.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA started the week strong, and was up 10.8% Wednesday evening. This was impressive, considering Tuesday and Weds. were red days for the sector.But Thursday came, and the stock tumbled; Friday it recovered some but still closed red. At week’s end, the stock was down 20 cents or 4.6% to close at $4.16. YTD, the stock’s gain is still a respectable 12.7%.The broader market continued a depressing trend. Just 3 weeks ago, on Feb. 12, the NAS was up 9.76% on the year. Yesterday (Friday), it went red on the year in the late morning. It recovered some, but finished the week down 2.06%, bringing its gain for 2021 down to 0.61%.The DOW reflected the market’s flight to quality, gaining 1.82% on the week, and bringing its yearly gain up to 3.58%. Mark your calendar. When’s the last time the DOW outperformed its “tech heavy” competitor?BA gave strong support to the DOW. The stock surged 5.29%, going green for 2021 by 4.61%.My bio indexes are apparently in a state of depression. The BTK dropped 3.61% (which is not so bad, comparatively); the IBB was tumbled 4.32%; the XBI took the Boobie Prize again, plummeting 6.24%. The XLV eeked out a win, by 0.36%. (4 Fridays ago, the XBI closed 16.8% higher!)The VXX took no comfort from what seemed like a lot of volatility, losing 5.68%.On March 5, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.62. The YoY gain is still a robust 157%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.50-5.11T 4.55-5.06W 4.53-4.90Th 3.99-4.93F 3.72-4.30And from last week:M 4.51-5.07T 3.95-4.50W 4.21-4.53Th 4.20-4.54F 4.06-4.48I closed my eyes and added to my IDRA yesterday, when the stock was at $3.79. For me, this was a rare occasion when I caught the stock close to its low for the day.Timing is usually not my forte. In fact, when I add to my IDRA or any stock, usually, the stock goes down. I mean, almost immediately after I click “buy”. It’s uncanny.But it doesn’t really matter. Let’s say that the 301 results come out and they’re great. Stellar ORR, beating all end points. Where will the stock be then?Let’s say the news doubles the market cap from here to $350 million. The stock price would be around $8.50. If my purchase price yesterday had been at $4.20, would I be unhappy I hadn’t caught the bottom yesterday?Absolutely not. I’d just be happy for every share I had.When I make a purchase, I’m not buying to cash out that day. My horizon is WAY down the road. So I don’t lose any sleep if I make a purchase at the high for the day.IDRA’s future is very bright. Keep that in mind, and add at these levels if you can.Sarge"
"I stated in a post 2 days ago that thought IDRA could reach $10 by the end of the week, and it did. I expect the drop after that was some short-term profit taking and trading. I see the stock rising to $12 by Labor Day and $15 by ESMO in October. Still only $1.14 pre-split after being at $2.55 in January before the merger distraction($20.40 split adjusted). Now the company is treating patients in phase 3 and that should progress quickly. This is not just a pivotal test, it is a transformative test----which I strongly believe will show the same or better success than the preceeding trails. Selling here is a mistake, unless you want to try a few pennies on a trade-----but that could backfire. Moving higher over the next 2 months."
IDRA IMO-2125 mechanism video is out... http://www.iderapharma.com/areas-of-focus/oncology/immuno-oncology/
"If I am reading the ASCO site information correctly, updated abstracts that are too be presented on June 4 (Idera) will be posted at 6:30 am CDT that morning. If that is correct, then the market should know the ORR and other critical metrics on 2125 by the open on Monday. Of course, the real color will come after the market closes with Dr. Diab's presser. We are at one of those inflection points that can change the trajectory of the company. Good luck to you all, and thanks for being on this interesting little journey with me."
"Looks like we have a compound name, Tilsotolimod. Unless I am mistaken, we have not seen that before.More importantly, can one of you medical folks check the poster presentation, and in particular the P values for the various treatment permutations. My (very fuzzy) understanding is that a P value below 0.05 is considered statistically significant. If that is the case, then the P values for the 2125 arms of the study seem significantly better to my very untrained eye. It would be great if we could have a better trained eye or two take a look at it. Thanks."
"There seems to be is a lot of 'splainin going on by the company. An immediate reaction is are they merely justifying a falling ORR? We all know the ORR is usually higher in Phase 2 than Phase 3 but if 25%+ holds we are still seeing a doubling of the ORR over current standard of care in a patient population essentially out of options. Many cancer drugs make it to the finish line with modest improvements in ORR. More recently however, ORR has been de-emphasized as a key determinant of value in the oncologist arsenal. Whether IDRA is just rationalizing or as usual at the forefront of progressive thinking, the true value of cancer drugs is now being measured by OS and achieving disease control with durability and safety. Tilso seems to check off these boxes. Additional positives are the one and done treatment protocol. If you want to take the negative view, a decrease in the ORR does not make for good headlines. Alridge makes a good point that the ipi alone arm will (finally) tell us what the true ORR is in this patient population which has been presumed though not independently proven to be 10-13%. Ipi plus Tilso will have to show a 10% improvement no matter where this true ORR lands. So we shall see. What is lost a little in the melanoma focus is that they are looking ahead at other tumor types and they have proven in the translational data that Tilso has a mechanism of action that turns cold tumors to hot with durability and safety. The market cap for refractory melanoma is limited. The market cap for solid tumors is unlimited. This is progress.Full disclosure is that I will CONSIDER taking some of my stake off the table as the year progresses in order to manage my personal risk. It is clear that unless they get a partner, a raise will be needed to pay for the expensive Phase 3 and the expansion into solid tumors and beyond. I am reluctant to carry the bucket endlessly for IDRA and I am not getting any younger. I will definitely stay invested but it might be time to consider some reallocation of funds. Time will tell. It will of course be at a loss. Good luck to longs here."
"Sorry in advance for the long post, but there is a lot of 13D/F/G data to digest.... I spent some time this weekend with the most recent ownership filings. My preferred source is WhaleWisdom, but they sometimes screw it up too (notably with Pillar), so I had to go back to my former analysis concerning Pillar’s holdings to get to the truth. First, I eliminated all the puts and calls (there are only a handful and we are trying to focus on ownership and not directional bets). Then I adjusted the Pillar ownership to 2,379,818 shares. I did a fairly exhaustive review of the Pillar ownership back in November and Pillar has not filed anything with the SEC since then, so I have to assume they still have the same number of shares. Finally, for the purposes of ownership percentages, I assumed 27,190,000 shares outstanding. If the company discloses a different number in their annual report (presumably as a result of the ATM) I will adjust that number in my spreadsheet and let you all know. Here are the results:TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP:Total Number of Institutional Owners: 86Total institutional shares: 14,936,819 shares (54.96% institutional ownership)Change from previous quarter: +744,215 shares (a 5.24% increase in institutional shares)BREAKDOWNTotal number of new institutional owners: 22Total number of new institutional owners’ shares: 1,217,789*****Total number of existing institutional owners increasing positions: 27Total number of shares added by existing institutional owners: 716,185*****Total number of existing institutional owners not changing positions: 23*****Total number of existing institutional owners decreasing positions (but not sold out): 14Total number of shares sold by existing institutional owners: 1,017,434*****Total number of existing institutional owners exiting their positions: 10Total number of shares exited (sold out) by existing institutional owners: 172,325OBSERVATIONS:6 of the 22 new investors had sold out last quarter and jumped back in in Q4. Of the 1,017,434 shares sold by existing investors that did not sell out, 985,761 (96.8%) were sold by 3 investors: Broadfin (22.7% decrease); FMR (99.9% decrease); and Vanguard (51.2% decrease).Finally, it has been speculated here that the funds must know something that we don’t, especially when the PPS was cratering in the last month of the year. Maybe. Certainly FMR (Fidelity) and Vanguard are very large, sophisticated funds and Broadfin is a very sophisticated healthcare-focused hedge fund akin to the Baker Bros Advisors (BTW, Broadfin has a history of buying and selling IDRA so it seems to be surfing the share price action a bit). But I think the overall net gain in shares coupled with new positions outnumbering sold out positions by more than 2:1 (and more than 5:1 when looking at shares) means that what they really know is to buy when others are fearful. Just my view.I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions that I can answer by sorting the data and I will try to do so. Good luck folks."
"Thinking further about the ATM selling in Q1, I have to agree with Gold that I do not know why they sold anything thus far this year - not because the PPS was in the sewer (which, it was (Laverne and Shirley from Happy Days reference there)) but rather because there was no obvious need. Maybe there is a reason that is not clear to us, but I sure can't figure out what it might be. Of course hindsight is 20/20, but in retrospect if they were going to sell shares it would have been far better to do so in late November or early December because between the effective date of the facility (November 26) and December 13 IDRA bounced along with closing prices between $6.06 and $7.42 (seems like forever ago, doesn't it?). Anyway, on December 14 the PPS did a faceplant, closing down $2.62 at $3.98 (remember the data cut?). It then continued a not-so-slow death spiral downward as the whole market got really loopy. The market's bottom was Christmas Eve, but IDRA continued to swirl around the bowl for another month before hitting its closing low $2.33 on January 23. Since then it has continually tried to move up but it has been choppy and mostly ineffective, closing at $2.80 today. We know from the 10K that IDRA did not sell shares during 2018 through that facility, but that it did between Jan 1 and Mar 6 of 2019. Those 425K shares represent an average purchase price of about $3.05. Since they averaged about $3.05 per share they either bought it all at one time for $3.05 or they bought in several chunks and averaged $3.05. Either way, they had to have sold a substantial amout of shares at $3.05 or better. There were 44 trading days between Jan 1 and Mar 6. About 1/3 of them (15) had a daily high (not close) of $3.05 or better and 8 of those were in the first 8 trading days of the year. So, while we can each reach our own conclusions as to whether it was smart to sell anything at this time (based on what I can see it was not), once they committed to do so they do appear to have sold in the upper part of the trading range over the period in question. So why does this matter? Well, like everyone else I have to decide if I think they are going to be foolish with their management of the ATM and the LP facility going foward. After all, they have the ability to sell up to $85 million worth of company stock in through these two vehicles. No matter what they do, current stockholders will be diluted. But if they do it foolishly we will be diluted more. Based on what I know I would not have sold the 425K shares at all. But once they committed to do it, they did reasonably well at getting an average price in the upper end of the range over the sale period. That is not the sign of irrational or incompetent individuals. I will be watching closely to see how they use these tools going forward but I am not afraid that they only want to get 3 bucks a share until they cap out. If they indeed do that, as Gold suggests, they will double the share count in exchange for $85 million. I think they want to do far better than that. Of course, the market also needs to cooperate to make that happen. Just my musings. Good luck to you all."
"In baseball, teams try to avoid that “disaster inning”. IDRA did not succeed this week.Let’s look at the numbers. Things started off well enough, with IDRA closing green in the first two sessions. But Wednesday, the market was down, and the home team could not withstand the onslaught, losing 6.1%. By week’s close, the stock price ended exactly where it was two Fridays before at $1.83, a loss of 3.17%.The broader market was mixed, and bio pharma was one of the positive sectors. After gaining 6% last week, the NAS gave back 1.17% this time. Its 2020 gain dropped from 1.66% to 0.46%.The DOW fared a bit worse, sliding 2.65%, bringing its loss on the year to an even 17%. Sorry to keep picking on BA, but the numbers are what they are. The stock lost over 10% on the week, which accounts for some if not all of the index’s losses.My bio indexes followed up on a stellar week with a solid one. The BTK followed up a gain of 6.9% with an additional 2.38%; the IBB did even better, up 2.99%; the XBI did best for the week, up 3.11%. The relatively conservative XLV was also green, up 1.02%. The volatility indicator, the VXX, was green, in spite of a red Friday. The ETN gained 4.72% to close at $36.60. On 5/15/19, IDRA closed at $2.66. This is a much better comparison than last week’s figure of $3.60. So even with this week’s loss, the YoY deficit shrunk from 47.5% to 31.2%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.86-2.02T 1.92-2.04W 1.76-1.97Th 1.75-1.85F 1.75-1.85 And from last week:M 1.73-1.85T 1.71-1.93W 1.82-1.89Th 1.79-1.87F 1.79-1.95 It’s not a stretch to say that in the market, this is an extraordinary time. In terms of job losses, we’re looking at numbers not seen since the 1930’s. And yet, there are definite winners out there. One thing is constant: investors are trying to foresee trends, and hop into stocks or sectors they think will withstand the current challenges.As I mentioned last week, the likes of AMZN and NFLX have done very well. Tech in general seems a logical play in the COVID-19 era.Others are not having as much fun. It’s mostly sector driven. Airlines are still getting pummeled, since it’s so unclear when, and to what extent, things will ramp up for them again. LUV investors are suffering from concussive syndrome; the stock set new 52-week lows on Wednesday and Thursday again this week, after having done so three times last week.I remember talking to a broker when I first started investing. I expressed some disappointment that stocks did not act as logically as I thought they should. Some stocks seemed to have all the value in the world, and yet never seemed to gain much. Others were soaring based on what appeared to be smoke and mirrors. The guy told me a phrase I have thought of many times since: “Don’t fight the tape!”. In other words, momentum is a Thing. And it continues until it stops, sometimes defying logic and seemingly every other rule, including gravity.In general, I try to use my brain when I trade, and often that means fighting my instincts. If I want to buy a stock, I try to do so on a day when it’s in the red. By the same token, if I have a stock I think is overvalued, I’ll try and sell it on a day when it’s up. Much of the time, my timing is off by a day or two in spite of my efforts.I broke my own rule this week. I’ve been collecting shares of TROV over the past year or so. It’s a cancer company in early stage trials. In March, I collected shares for under a buck. Recently, the stock has made some news. A pivotal early stage trial went well. The company changed its name from Trovagene to Cardiff Oncology (now CRDF), and this past week, reached a financing agreement to carry them through the next stage of trials. The day after the news came out, the stock was up, and, uncharacteristically, I decided to add some shares. The stock had closed trading Tuesday at $1.28. The news came out that evening, and there was high volume AH and pre-market, all green. Wednesday, the stock traded as high as $1.55 in the morning. That afternoon, I made a purchase at $1.395. As seems ALWAYS the case, the stock went down after I bought it, and it closed at $1.32. Just my luck.But Thursday, the stock gained over 8% and closed at $1.43. Friday, it went crazy and gained almost 33% to close at $1.90. So much for my rules! But I’m not complaining…So carry on, friends. If you have stories of your own to share, I’d like to hear them.Sarge"
I believe it was on Twits that I debated with a Dynavax loyal that the increased 8 mg dosing of Dynavax was not necessarily going to show increased efficacy over the 2 mg multi tumor dosing. Their reasoning was that maximal effective/tolerable dose had not yet been achieved so results would likely improve. It was pointed out that IDRA had been there done that and increasing doses of TLR-9 appeared to result in a counter-regulatory effect in the microenvironment actually reducing efficacy. Their recent data shows that the 2 mg dosing resulted in a 19% ORR while the 8 mg dose resulted in a 13% ORR. This further proves the IDRA findings of well over 2 years ago that with TLR-9 more is not necessarily better. I wonder if these luke-warm results prompted the recent decision of Dynavax to abandon the IO space. We need Tilso to maintain the 30+% range to avoid following the same path....Dynavax has more in the pipeline...IDRA does not. All indications are that IDRA will be the best TLR-9. It goes without saying biotech is a risky business...Good luck to us.
"With only 24% institutional ownership(according to Ameritrade), now that the stock price has surpassed the ""magical"" $5 level, there could be substantial fund buying. The timing couldn't be better for funds as the pivotal P3 data readout is just weeks or a few months away. I don't expect funds to take enormous positions, but with a public float of only 35 million shares now if enough funds take moderate positions, fund ownership could reach 50%---which is also a critical level for supporting a stock price and encouraging further investment. The confluence of positive events is about as bullish a situation as IDRA has had in quite a few years. Hang on for a what could be a very fun ride."
Good data.ORR of 22.4% Comment: not the 30% we had once hoped for but solid and double of Ipi alone (10-13%).DCR of 71.4 % with 11.4 median duration of response with 64% showing durability of more than 6 months.This is very good data for this sick patient population.TEAE of 48% is higher than I would like to see but acceptable for high risk cancer patients. Most of the toxicity is Ipi related.Abscopal effect is a big positive.If the Phase 3 proves this out in a larger patient population with a comparator arm this will be approved.If upcoming data on colon is good it will provide some indication that Tilso may be of benefit in other solid tumors thus expanding the indications without adding toxicities.
"Two weeks ago, I optimistically wrote about seeing Quadville on the horizon. It seems we’ve run into a traffic jam…where you actually go backwards.Let’s look at the numbers - it’s not pretty. Since I posted last, IDRA has been red in 9 out of 10 sessions. Last week, the stock lost 11.7%; this week’s loss was 6.78%, with a closing price of $2.61. Instead of looking at higher goals, we wonder whether we’ll be re-visiting the 52-week low that was set on August 15 ($2.08).The broader market, meanwhile, has struggled the past two weeks. The NAS lost 0.72% last week, following-up with a loss of 2.19% this week. Its 2019 gain has dropped from 23.2% to 19.7%. The DOW lost as well, but not as much, with its yearly gain dropping from 16.98% to 15.3% over two weeks.My bio indexes managed slight gains last week, but this week was bleak: the BTK fell 6.1%; the IBB did only slightly better, down 5.92%; the XBI had a horrible week, tumbling 7.57%. The XLV was relatively unscathed, down 2.9%. On 9/27/18, IDRA closed at $8.60 (split adjusted). The YoY loss now stands at 69.6%. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.77-2.95T 2.70-2.91W 2.69-2.77Th 2.58-2.71 F 2.56-2.71 And from last week:M 3.08-3.24T 2.94-3.11W 2.85-2.99Th 2.81-2.93 F 2.76-2.85This weekend’s epistle is dedicated to @Eduardo, who has been a Job-like investor here for several years, along with several other ne'r-do-wells here (including myself).One of the hallmarks of maturity is the ability to tolerate delayed gratification. This stock must be one of the best at helping us grow up.The problem is that this was never promised to be a smooth ride with a beautiful chart. Investing in pharma development means you get an investment that is fraught with land mines. Low cash (and the recurring need to raise it); little to no revenue; and only sporadic news to bolster the Street’s support of the stock.It’s really a recipe for frustration.AND, when the stock finally fulfills its potential (IF you haven’t sold your shares months, or even years, before), it’s often in the form of a buyout, when you get a huge day of smiling. Then your payoff comes in a matter of weeks, and the ordeal is over and you have (hopefully) a respectable profit.And, also a little PTSD.I like the news this week about how the Tilso trials are filling up much more quickly than projected, and may be full 4-5 months ahead of time. That is a great sign of good management, revealing a true focus by the company, and perhaps a lot of market need as well. And, it’s about all we get in terms of tea leaves to read while we wait. And wait.But that’s the nature of this. If you want a stock that’s going to go up most of the time, maybe this isn’t the sector for you. For me, it’s ok. I wait and watch, and add to my holdings when I get angry enough at the stock price.But it’s all money that I don’t need right now. I’m blessed to be in this situation, where every penny I have isn’t needed for survival. This is mad money. And IF we’ve chosen well, it WILL pay off. But on the Street, there are no shortcuts. Sorry, my friend.Sarge"
