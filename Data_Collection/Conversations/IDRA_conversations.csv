"Solid presentation today. Milano seems energized and Horobin was clear and concise. (As a an aside, they addressed her retirement - Horobin will be the last person left in Boston, but she is going to continue advising and working (not day to day) on the Tilso program. Her husband is already retired. This explains things a bit more.)As for the presentation, the slides are a skinny version of the January JPM slide deck. In no particular order, here are my thoughts:1. Slide 6 is an updated version of the summary of results to date on the 204 program. It is identical to the version presented at JPM except that is now shows 3 CR’s instead of 2, for an overall CR rate of 8.8%. Note, there is an error on the slide because it should have reduced the PR count to 8 and lowered the PR percentage to 23.5% (to reflect that a person moved from PR to CR).2. Illuminate 204 – Data for all patients should be available by the end of the year. Likely will be presented at a medical conference, I am assuming sometime in Q4.3. Illuminate 301 – Up to 80 sites now and “well on our way” to enroll 300 patients by the end of 2019.4. When discussing “business development” Milano made an interesting statement. He said they were, “Trying to leverage another asset in the company.” I found this curious as it implied that they had an internal asset they were looking at trying to do something with. However, I asked Bob Doody about this and he clarified that “[Milano] was just referring to trying to bring in more assets.” 5. Another point that both Milano and Horobin made was the need to get “mature data” because interim data tends to under-report the response rate. This issue here, as has been discussed on this board by Tursta, Sarge and many others is that the mechanism of action is such that the longer you go after treatment the more opportunity Tilso has to do its thing. Along this same vein, Dr. Horobin specifically said that she felt the December data cut under-reported the response rate. She further stated that SD over time leads to an increase in Overall Survival (OS) which is one of the two endpoints for the Illuminate 301 study. Still further along these same lines, Dr. Horobin said that Ipi has a median response time of 12 weeks and that the first measurement in the 204 study was 8 weeks. This means that, on average, the first data readout on a patient in the 204 study might not even be seeing the combination effect from Ipi in addition to Tilso (this last sentence is my conclusion, not Dr. Horobin’s). Finally, Dr. Horobin added that this timing issue is why the Illuminate 301 trial is designed to have its first measurement at 12 weeks and not 8.6. IDRA has a self-imposed “moratorium” on updates to the 204 study. I think they got stung a little by “immature data” trickling out that also depressed their previous ORR number. I am not sure we will see another data cut on 204 until Q4.7. Both Milano and Dr. Horobin talked about the path for Tilso with the FDA. In particular they said that durability of response may very well be a differentiator between being able to get Accelerated Approval and having to wait for the OS data to come in on the phase 3. When asked how long is long enough, IDRA said that the FDA does not publish an exact threshold, but their best feeling was the FDA want better than 6-month improvement in OS, but it was not clear to me whether this was to support AA or simply to support approval.8. Finally, Milano also indicated that he thought they would have one or both of the new trials (head and neck and CRC) operational by the end of Q2. Dr. Horobin added that she very much felt that Tilso had applications far beyond melanoma and she seem particularly excited about the MSS-CRC trial, although she did not go into detail.I hope that helps."
"Monday was terrific. Then the light on the dashboard came on.Let’s look at the numbers. Monday was indeed fine, with the stock gaining 4.36%, and never getting close to the prior Friday’s closing price – green all day.Then we moved from the Emerald City to Red City. The rest of the week combined for a loss of 7.8%. When the dust settled, the stock was down 20 cents or 3.79% to close at $5.07.Reality check: this is the 4th straight week the stock has closed every session with a 5-handle. And YTD, the stock is still up a pride-inducing 37.4%.The broader market had a similar story, with generally tepid results. The NAS did close the week at yet another all-time closing high, rising 1.73%. Its gain for 2021 stands at 9.76%. It’s mid-February, friends.The DOW also found its way to the record books, gaining 0.99% to end at an all-time closing high. On the year, it’s gained 3.45%, which is a gaudy number by its standards. BA followed up a gain of 7.07% last week with a more modest gain of 1.47%. Its loss on the year is down to 1.13%.My bio indexes were a mixed bag. The BTK slid 0.84%; the IBB, meanwhile, was green by 0.99%; the XBI, despite gaining 4.3% on Monday, closed the week down 1.47%. The XLV ended up the Winner this week with a gain of 1.39%. If there was a party, the VXX missed it. It closed the week down 4.43% at $15.74.On February 12, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.59. The YoY gain remains a stunning 218.8%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 5.34-5.55T 5.28-5.60W 5.12-5.53Th 4.96-5.22F 4.95-5.40And from last week:M 5.36-5.70T 5.30-5.71W 5.30-5.73Th 5.26-5.68F 5.20-5.60Technical analysts will tell you it really doesn’t matter what business a company does. By seeing its trading patterns, they can predict the movement of a stock.The funny thing is, they’re often right.But I have always held that ultimately, value is the thing that drives a stock’s price. The thing that drives value, of course, is earnings.So it’s a mix, IMO. Value plus technical.In IDRA’s case, as is often the situation in pharma development, there is no income. Stock price pops most often come as a result of news of clinical results.If the company posts results that exceed expectations, pow! A stock that’s been languishing for weeks can shoot up 30% or 40% or more in a day, on huge volume. But it seldom lasts.After a day or two of glory and checking the market every 10 minutes, many pharma stocks will come back to earth pretty quickly. In spite of the promise, income is still a distant dream.Why, then, has IDRA not settled back these past few months? With each dramatic rise, the stock has settled a bit, but never back to where it came from. Glance at a 6-month chart.Why? @Andy reminded me to look at the company’s 2021 Corporate Statement. Tilso looks likely to knock it out of the park when the 301 results for melanoma come out later this quarter. And the story does not end there. There are many other types of cancer this drug can help, as it “bird dogs” for tumors in the body. Some of them have no current effective treatments.That’s the value the analysts see. Even discounting for the time spent waiting for FDA approval, the value is too great to discount all together.So we wait, and buy on the dips. Here’s some nice waiting music to keep us company.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTVjnBo96UgSarge"

"For those who might not have read, IDRA just filed and 8K disclosing the compensation for the 5 major members of the Executive Team (CEO, CFO, General Counsel, SVP-Biz Dev, and Chief Scientific Officer). They also disclosed a new pay structure for the CEO. Here are the highlights:- No raises for anyone except the CFO. I suspect the only reason the CFO's comp was adjusted was that he started midway through 2019; - They were each awarded stock options, which give them the right to buy IDRA shares in the future at $1.79 per share (the exercise price). These options vest 25% per year over a 4 year period, so the first quarter vests on January 10, 2020; - They were also each awarded restricted stock units (""RSU""). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of IDRA on the date it vests. Again, the vesting schedule is 25% per year over 4 years. What is important to recognize about RSUs is that they each represent the right to receive one share of stock. There is no exercise price. So 1000 RSUs gives the recipient the right to receive 1000 shares of stock. Contrast this to options - 1000 options with an exercise price of $1.79 gives the recipient the right to buy 1000 shares of stock for $1.79. If, at the time of exercise, the stock has a value of $11.79 then the recipient has the right to make a $10,000 profit ($11.79-$1.79 x 1000). On the other hand if the share price is less than the exercise price, the option is worthless;- Additionally, Vin Milano (CEO) had his employment agree altered. For the first 10 days of 2020 he was paid in cash. From January 10 through the end of 2020 he will be paid $6600 in cash and an award of RSUs on December 18, 2020. The total of these three add up to his $600,000 base salary;- They all received annual bonuses as well.From my perspective there are really two interesting things here. First, the base comp is going to be flat for everyone except the CFO vs. last year. Second, Milano is pretty much giving up cash comp in exchange for stock. There are several ways to read all of this. First, I think the lack of salary increases is a symbolic belt-tightening at IDRA. The amounts are immaterial, but the C-suite not getting raises sends a signal that they are trying to conserve cash. Yes, they could also terminate folks and save a lot more, but that sends a very different signal (and they also just did that last year). Second is Milano's salary. This move saves almost 600K in cash over the year but, more importantly, it seems to be an effort to very closely align Milano's comp to stock performance. It is interesting that the describe this as: ""and $575,218.16 shall be payable in the form of a restricted stock unit grant to be granted to Mr. Milano on December 18, 2020 (the “RSU Award”)"".As I noted above, RSUs represent a number of shares, not a dollar value. It is not clear to me from the info available how the December 18 RSU grant will converted to shares. Is it $575,218 worth of shares on December 18, 2020 or is it $575,218 worth of shares based on the current PPS, to be granted on December 18? The latter would very much align is comp to the share price appreciation while the for is more akin to simply conserving cash and paying him in stock (yes, diluting you and me to pay Milano). I suspect the grant of RSUs is made now and based on the current share price (i.e. $575,218/$1.79 would be a grant of 321.350 RSUs which he could convert to the same number of shares on December 18), but I cannot be sure since the blanks in the form are not filled in.Draw your own conclusions about what this all means, and good luck to you."
IDRA is a victim fraudulent media mob. I sincerely hope that you find reason to to rethink and take back your position. I just bought the dip.

"It’s the dog days for IDRA. Which is good, because that’s exactly how it feels.Let’s look at the numbers. IDRA went red for a second week in a row, falling 9 cents or 3.18% to close at $2.74. Still longing for the posh life of a 3-handle…For 2019, IDRA has gone back to red, with a 1.17% loss. The sector also had a lousy week. The NAS went red on the week for the first time in 2019, dropping 2.47% and bringing the year’s gain down to 11.7%. My bio indicators, however, made the NAS look like a party: the BTK fell 5.44%; the IBB was worse, down 5.65%; not to be outdone, the XBI sank the most, losing 5.83%. The XLV was better but still bad, losing 3.82%. The DOW joined the losing parade, off by “just” 2.21%. Down 2 weeks in a row now, the year’s gain is down to 9.1%. On 3/8/18, IDRA closed at $16.16 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now at 83%. Let’s not dwell on this. Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.70-2.93T 2.77-2.88W 2.57-2.84Th 2.45-2.84 F 2.66-2.80And from last week:M 2.80-3.05T 2.88-2.98W 2.88-3.09Th 2.71-3.02 F 2.64-2.84So, optimistically, here’s the thing: we’ve spent one more week with some distance between the current price and the lows of late January. The longer this lasts, the stronger that level of support becomes. That’s as good as I can put it regarding the current stock price.I owe you an update on my NVAX episode that I mentioned last week. Well, I’m not a genius just yet. Recall that the stock had slid from $2.13 to 71 cents, where I added to my position for a relatively low price. Of course, I expected it bounce back right away.That didn’t happen. I added to my position AGAIN this Wednesday, when the stock was at 0.557. It closed Friday at 52 cents a share.I’ll tell ya, the Street is ruthless. As an old friend on the AVNR board used to say, the traders are sharks, and we individual investors are just chum.Well, we are. For a time. Part of the “fun” of investing, apparently, is feeling humiliated after you make a trade. At least in the short term. At least, that’s how it seems to happen for ME. But you buy stocks in pharma development not for what the price will be next week, but for what it will be 6 months or a year from now. Or two years…For IDRA, we must continuously monitor the science. THAT’s the issue – does the company we have invested in have VALUE. If it does, we should stick with our investment, and buy on the dips if possible. If it does not, we need to find another place to invest.I’m so grateful to Tursta and Alridge, and all who help on the science front. We have learned that Tilso is very popular in potential combo with other therapies. The “cocktail” approach seems to be the newest, best practice for battling certain forms of cancer. It could very well be that Tilso will be part of a lot of combination therapies, when all is said and done.We watch, and we wait. And we try to keep in mind that the market was not designed for immediate gratification, especially in this industry. More like eventual gratification. But if we’ve played our cards right, that gratification will be significant. Sarge"

"IDRA continued its tendency to perform well on Fridays yesterday. That’s a good trait.Let’s look at the numbers. After starting the year with a stellar gain of 15.99%, I wondered if IDRA could keep up the momentum. By Thursday evening, the stock had been green 2 sessions and red 2 as well. The stock was up 5 cents (1.17%), but Options Friday loomed.The day didn’t start well, as the stock traded to its session low ($4.15) around 10:30. But from that point, the stock pretty much climbed the rest of the day, ending with a gain of 15 cents on the day and 20 cents (4.67%) on the week to close at $4.48. After 2 weeks, the year’s gain is 21.4%!The broader market struggled amidst a nation in turmoil. The NAS gave back about half of its gains from last week, down 1.54%. The gain on the new year shrunk to 1.22%.The DOW also struggled, down 0.91% on the week. Blame BA, which is still answering questions about a crash in Indonesia last week. It went red for the second time in a row, this time by 2.66%. The young year’s loss stands at 4.25%.My bio indexes, with one exception, actually managed a second straight green week (though not as spectacular as last week). The BTK gained 1.06%; the IBB was the leader of an average pack, up 2.2%; the XBI got to play second fiddle, gaining 1.48%. The XLV was the only attendee in the red, sliding 0.36%. So small caps may have had the upper hand this week.The VXX reflected the turmoil around the country, and this case it means it was saying “yippee”. After 4 red weeks in a row, it scored a gain of 4.65% to close at $17.11..On January 15, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.89. The YoY comparison therefore is a gaudy gain of 137%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 4.10-4.38T 4.13-4.34W 4.02-4.30Th 4.12-4.39F 4.15-4.49And from last week:M 3.52-4.02T 3.90-4.13W 3.88-4.04Th 4.00-4.13F 4.02-4.40Before we longs start puffing out our chests, we need to acknowledge that this year’s gains are due in large part to the stock’s lousy performance at the end of December. As some commented here at the time, the stock was simply oversold.That being said, it WAS options expiration day Friday, and some of my stocks, especially CRDF, got their hats handed to them. Somehow, IDRA came out unscathed.Why? Value. IDRA has a promising, effective cancer drug in trials, and its market cap is well under $200 million (Yahoo has it at $170 million; E-Trade has it at $158 million).And, updated trial results are in sight. The company says in the first quarter. I’m assuming that means March, probably late in the month. But that’s coming up fast.Now, the aforementioned CRDF, which lost over 31% yesterday, did release an update on a trial for its primary drug in trials yesterday morning. The results were VERY similar to results that led the stock to skyrocket last fall, but yesterday, the market decided to pounce.At $475 million, CDRF’s market cap is well over twice IDRA’s even after yesterday’s plunge. It may well have been due for a trim, and I’m certain options expiration was in the mix.There are absolutely no guarantees on Wall St. No such thing as a sure thing. But looking at the chart, it looks like IDRA has gotten a decent sized correction out of its system, and is looking to take a run at a 5-handle in the foreseeable future.I like the way the stock is acting. We’ll see if I’m right. The numbers will tell the story.Sarge"
"The tree shaketh a little, sometimes.Let’s look at the numbers. While the sector threw a party, IDRA, in true pandemic fashion, stayed home with the shades pulled. It just wasn’t IDRA’s week. Monday sums it up. The NAS gained 2.55%, and the XBI surged 4.4%. Meanwhile, our favorite stock lost 8 cents. Frankly, I think the stock was due for a pause, and we should feel lucky the market wasn’t down, or the damage could have been worse.In the end, IDRA lost 32 cents or 5.72% to close at $5.27. YTD, the stock is still up a robust 42.8%.The broader market was remarkably supportive, as several indexes set all-time highs. The NAS led the way, surging 6.01%. Its gain for 2021 rose from 1.77% to 7.89%. Not bad for 5 weeks.The DOW also had a stellar week, climbing 3.89%, and changing its status on the year from a loss of 1.39% to a gain of 2.43%. BA finally found some traction after some struggles. This week, it gained back 7.07%, shrinking its loss on the year from 8.99% to 2.56%.My bio indexes put on a fireworks display. The BTK gained 4.23%, which would have gotten headlines any other week; the IBB made the BTK look like yesterday’s beans, however, charging 5.23%; and THAT would have been impressive had the XBI not gained 9.09%! The XLV showed that this party was for small caps only, shuffling forward 0.56%. While everyone else was smiling, the VXX got served with papers. As the market charged, it plunged, tumbling 21.9% to $16.47.On February 5, 2020, IDRA closed at $1.68. The YoY gain remains a stunning 213.7%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 5.36-5.70T 5.30-5.71W 5.30-5.73Th 5.26-5.68F 5.20-5.60And from last week:M 5.70-6.10T 5.35-6.09W 5.26-5.94Th 5.27-5.69F 5.50-6.12IDRA is going to do great things. That’s our mantra.Investing is, frankly, often demoralizing. IMO, to be successful, one has to fight the most basic human instincts.Buy low, and sell high. Talk about easier said than done!As @Andy has pointed out, the Bakers have a large stake in IDRA. They have an incredibly successful track record. Do we think THEY sell the stock when the price goes down? Not if the fundamentals haven’t changed. If that’s the case, they’re adding.Right now, we’re awaiting trial results. The company can’t give us a preview – we ALL have to wait until the results are posted. What happens while we wait? Wild speculation.It’s human nature. Flee danger; run toward safety and, hopefully, prosperity.IDRA traded to a high of $6.14 on Jan. 21. Yesterday, it traded to a low of $5.20, a correction of 15.3%. So the stock can go up now…any time is fine by me.What if it doesn’t? What if the market is not as friendly as this week was, and we still have no news? IDRA could conceivably go down further.IDRA could even (gasp!) get down to a 4-handle. What would things look like then?A little panicky, I’d say. Plus, some vermin would appear around here, predicting the demise of the stock, the company, and civilization as we know it.What should we do then?I propose, if the stock gets a 4-handle, we each buy 20 shares. The cost would be less than a hundred bucks, plus commission.The stock might go down further after that. Because the market IS that nasty. But I’ll say this: in not too much time, we’ll be proud of that purchase. And, that pride will only grow over time.Mull it over. Hopefully the stock will shoot up Monday, and this will all be academic. But if it doesn’t, I have a plan.Sarge"
"Sorry in advance for the long post, but there is a lot of 13D/F/G data to digest.... I spent some time this weekend with the most recent ownership filings. My preferred source is WhaleWisdom, but they sometimes screw it up too (notably with Pillar), so I had to go back to my former analysis concerning Pillar’s holdings to get to the truth. First, I eliminated all the puts and calls (there are only a handful and we are trying to focus on ownership and not directional bets). Then I adjusted the Pillar ownership to 2,379,818 shares. I did a fairly exhaustive review of the Pillar ownership back in November and Pillar has not filed anything with the SEC since then, so I have to assume they still have the same number of shares. Finally, for the purposes of ownership percentages, I assumed 27,190,000 shares outstanding. If the company discloses a different number in their annual report (presumably as a result of the ATM) I will adjust that number in my spreadsheet and let you all know. Here are the results:TOTAL INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP:Total Number of Institutional Owners: 86Total institutional shares: 14,936,819 shares (54.96% institutional ownership)Change from previous quarter: +744,215 shares (a 5.24% increase in institutional shares)BREAKDOWNTotal number of new institutional owners: 22Total number of new institutional owners’ shares: 1,217,789*****Total number of existing institutional owners increasing positions: 27Total number of shares added by existing institutional owners: 716,185*****Total number of existing institutional owners not changing positions: 23*****Total number of existing institutional owners decreasing positions (but not sold out): 14Total number of shares sold by existing institutional owners: 1,017,434*****Total number of existing institutional owners exiting their positions: 10Total number of shares exited (sold out) by existing institutional owners: 172,325OBSERVATIONS:6 of the 22 new investors had sold out last quarter and jumped back in in Q4. Of the 1,017,434 shares sold by existing investors that did not sell out, 985,761 (96.8%) were sold by 3 investors: Broadfin (22.7% decrease); FMR (99.9% decrease); and Vanguard (51.2% decrease).Finally, it has been speculated here that the funds must know something that we don’t, especially when the PPS was cratering in the last month of the year. Maybe. Certainly FMR (Fidelity) and Vanguard are very large, sophisticated funds and Broadfin is a very sophisticated healthcare-focused hedge fund akin to the Baker Bros Advisors (BTW, Broadfin has a history of buying and selling IDRA so it seems to be surfing the share price action a bit). But I think the overall net gain in shares coupled with new positions outnumbering sold out positions by more than 2:1 (and more than 5:1 when looking at shares) means that what they really know is to buy when others are fearful. Just my view.I hope this information is helpful. Let me know if you have any questions that I can answer by sorting the data and I will try to do so. Good luck folks."

"Welcome to IDRA, aka the Emerald City.Let’s look at the numbers. Why Emerald City? Because IDRA was green every session this week. Know when that last happened to this stock? The week of May 14-18, 2018. Yeah, it’s rare.As you’ll see below, there was substantial sector support. Whatever the cause (besides the obvious return of @playthrough2001 to the MB), the stock had gains ranging from 2.68% to 15.4%, and closed up a dramatic 76 cents (39.6%) on the week, closing at $2.68. The stock now boasts a gain of 47.25% on the year.The broader market hosted a yawning festival, while the sector had a fireworks display. The NAS made it 3 red weeks in a row, but not dramatically so. The index lost 0.56%, and its gain on the year is now at 20.3% (which of course isn’t bad with the 3rd quarter not yet over). The DOW almost eeked out a win, but not quite, as it slid just 0.03%. For the year, the venerable index has given back 3.08%.BA reflected its index, and it’s a little weird the way that happens so often. It gained 0.57%, and trimmed its 2020 loss from 50.8% to 50.5%. My bio indexes were pretty stellar. The BTK set a brisk pace with a gain of 4.21%; the IBB was better, up 6.67%; the XBI was Best of Breed, soaring 11.3%. The XLV was annoyingly conservative, nudging up 0.91%. The VXX managed to go red every day this week, and I’m sure that’s rare too. It closed at $24.37, a loss of 4.51%. Might have to nibble here this week.On 9/18/19, IDRA closed at $2.90. That’s 10 cents lower than last week’s number. Combined with the stock’s stellar performance, the YoY loss was trimmed from 36% to 7.58%.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 1.95-2.37T 2.07-2.39W 2.33-2.50Th 2.45-2.70F 2.47-2.75 And from last week:M HOLIDAYT 1.90-2.00W 1.96-2.05Th 1.93-1.99F 1.92-1.99Last week, I returned to a theme that’s applicable all too often around here: perseverance. I spoke wistfully of that time, off in the distant future, when we might reap the rewards of this investment.Little did I know.As I looked over my little spread sheet and saw that the stock was green every session, it struck me it was a rare phenomenon. But over 2 years? That really is rare.The cause has to be Tilso, or rather, anticipation of its trial results. Early in the week, the company announced its participation in the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) “virtual congress”, this weekend. There was also a presentation at the H.C. Wainwright Investment Conference on Tuesday afternoon; the stock did surge late that afternoon.I think a lot of it comes down to market cap. Take a look – Yahoo reports it’s under $95 million. Million? Seriously? So…just to get to a $1B market cap, the stock price would have to be over ten times higher. And the company has a product that is effective, mild, and keeps hitting its marks on trials…with different types of cancer? I think we’re in the midst of a serious market cap adjustment.Which is just beginning.Welcome back to the conversation, @playthrough2001. Fasten your seat belt. We may be climbing at a fairly steep rate for a while.Sarge"
"Nice volume and price action today. That should get lots of eyes on the story. I don't post much anymore but I assure you that is not due to lack of interest or financial commitment. My musings have been mostly about vetting the clinical science and the mechanistic strategies rather than MC, PPS, ATMs etc. As we now enter the final push toward commercialization/approval and maturation of the company and science I very much appreciate the financial/technical types here that have our backs posting their thought as we go forward. I think this is going to get exciting not only financially but as an agent that has wide reach in extending both the quality and duration of lives not just in melanoma. I will say I am not in total agreement that we can expect some improvement in the ORR in the Phase 3. While the strategy has been to now use this in less sick patients rather than essentially all comers common in Phase 2 trials, this has to be balanced by the historical tendency of Phase 3 results often not quite being as stellar as Phase 2 results. Hopefully cleaning up the selection criteria will counteract this tendency. Suffice it to say if we maintain the 20+% ORR and the 75+% DCR with the confirmed excellent safety record for Tilso and the essentially one and done strategy, then we should be in great position. Good luck all."
So where does Idera go from here?
"The word for today is “swanky”.Let’s look at the numbers. After two red weeks, IDRA was positive from Tuesday on, gaining 24 cents or 8.76% to close at $2.98. Tantalizingly close to a 3-handle. Swanky!For 2019, IDRA has sprung back to green, with a 7.58% gain. The sector seems to be in a see-saw pattern, and this was a week when things were looking up. The NAS set a new 2019 high, charging 3.78% and bringing the year’s gain up to an impressive 15.9%. My bio indicators were happy to join the fray: the BTK led the way, gaining 5.87%; the IBB impressed, adding 5.15%; the XBI was even more impressive, surging 5.56%. The XLV had a week that would be noteworthy most any other time, rising 2.89%. The DOW managed a gain despite Boeing’s best efforts to the contrary, up 1.56%. For 2019, the index is up 10.8%. On 3/15/18, IDRA closed at $15.60 (split adjusted). YoY, the loss is now at 80.9%. Amazingly, this is an improvement.Here are the daily ranges for the week:M 2.67-2.81T 2.68-2.81W 2.67-2.94Th 2.78-2.92 F 2.80-3.00And from last week:M 2.70-2.93T 2.77-2.88W 2.57-2.84Th 2.45-2.84 F 2.66-2.80The poster @Rain asked last night for projections as to the potential of IDRA. I’ll try and give some perspective.First, if you haven’t already, give a listen to Wednesday’s Barclay’s presentation. A stock price will not rise if the company’s product has no value. Take a look and a listen, and re-assess – again – whether you think Tilso is worth pursuing. If the answer is no, you should start making exit plans right now.In terms of value, I’d encourage folks here to think in terms of market cap rather than stock price. E-Trade says the market cap for IDRA is only $80.7 million. There are 27.6 million shares outstanding. As much as I resented the RS, that’s a pretty low number of available shares for a drug development company, which gives the company some flexibility to raise cash (the dreaded ATM!).IDRA’s market cap is miniscule. During the presentation, Vince brought up his great success, ViroPharma, which was a rare disease company. They built it to a point where it was acquired for $4 billion. I did the math. $4 billion divided by 80 million (IDRA shares) is 50. Would you agree to a sales price of $149 per share? Because that’s 50 times the current IDRA share price.My greatest success in the market so far is Avanir. It was a company with one drug on the market, Nuedexta. This was a combination of two old generic drugs, Quinidine and Dextromethorphan, which helped patients who had a various of diseases or challenges (ALS, MS, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, to name a few) have fewer episodes of inappropriate emotional reactions (laughing at a funeral, for example).The drug worked; the challenge was to find the patients, as the inappropriate emotional responses tended to isolate those patients.In the meantime, the drug was being tested for other applications. Early on, the president of the company had referred to the drug as, potentially, the “aspirin for Neurology”, as it temporarily heals lesions in the brain.I held that stock for over a decade, with very little encouragement from the market. But when it happened, it seemed to happen all at once. I had bought shares at $1 for what seemed like an eternity. Ultimately, the company sold for $17 per share. At the time of the sale, the 52-week low price for the stock was $3.02.Read that again. $3.02, and in a matter of months, a sale at $17.00.But it happened in stages. As I recall, the real struggle was getting the stock from $1 to $2. After that, the next plateau for the stock price was around $5.00. The morning that a second application for Nuedexta was proven in trials, the stock jumped up from around $5 to about $12.00. The stock then drifted up to a $14 handle over the next few weeks, and one morning, they announced the sale at $17, which at the time was a premium of less than 20%.So it can happen, @Rain. The trick is to stick around even when there are the inevitable attacks on the stock price. The big reward ONLY comes to those who wait and hold. And wait.Sarge"
