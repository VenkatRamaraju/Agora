adios GO
52 week low today. There's your sign. Take out what you have left.
"Has anyone had any direct contact with investor relations, Grayson Andersen of late? I know a few posters who have been in contact before and apparently say he is pretty good at responding to messages. Clearly he isn't going to release any sensitive info but I wondered if he might elaborate more on when we can expect some more publicly released data to be made available. If I'm not mistaken, we still haven't had the full details / test results of the 6-1 well, which was capped a while ago now and obviously 2D seismic and third drill location are surely pending some kind of announcement soon. Surely they're not going to drill a third well without giving some insight as to how they reached that decision, which will involve needing to release some data re the 2D. Fingers crossed for some super positive news soon, I think all us longs need a little lift after the past few months, which has been a sustained period of silence by Reco and the usual public attacks and garbage by the msm and fuds, #go Reco, how cool would it be if Namibia and Botswana got super rich off of a huge untapped oil basin, with billions and billions of barrels of oil, and they also used that wealth to help develop and nurture their eco and natural environment. That would have all the green bed wetters frothing at the mouth GLTA longs, Reco, the Kavango and the people of Namibia and Botswana "
Letâ€™s go!! Getting back to green soon.
"Any one know what is going on with Grocery Outlet ? So many mixed messages on their 'business model' and insiders are always selling and it just doesn't look right . Cant find a reason to 'hold ' or 'buy ' Headed to under ? ? Somebody ,Anybody ~ Please advise !"
One rather large trade went thru earlier. Volume is high and that problem in this situation
"this is a good buy right now, no problem going back to $33-$34. I went to my local grocery outlet and was surprised by how many people were shopping there, I immediately decided that I wanted to invest. luckily, there was a sell off and was able to get in at a good price."
"If the company can afford itself all those things that we may look at the chart, it's clear on which level they are able to manage their stores."
50% of Market Cap is gone in last number of months. Is it going to lose another 50% now?
Grocery Outlet Holding is down 4.94% to 21.36
"Finally moving in the right direction. with food costs skyrocketing, people will be looking for savings"
24 is not so good for GO I know nobody cares but i have been building a position and it about finished. This sure is a lonely place. Perfect for wsb
Back in the money!
"Ouch. It does hurt to have seen this stock riding high at CAD 14 not so long ago and now be back down to sub CAD 5. It feels like there is clearly a sustained attack on Reco not only by the shorts and woke msm and d list celebs but even by some of the idiotic namibian politicians, who have been making noises that the country is being exploited for its resources and claiming they only get a 10% cut , which as we all know is total nonsense and ignores the millions of dollars and investment that has already been put into the project by Reco at no expense to the Namibian people, plus the investment in covid vaccines, ESG, water wells etc, employment of hundreds of locals as part of the seismic, drilling etc. And this is for a country which let's not forget, to date, has never produced any commercial oil, fingers crossed it will do and hopefully billions and billions of barrels, but I think a few of their politicians need to get a bit more of a grip on reality. But it does feel like us longs are long (excuse the pun) overdue some really positive news on this story. I think the last really bit of positive news that sent the SP racing was when they confirmed traces of oil at the 6-2 drill location. Since then, most of the news stories seem to have been underwhelming and / or moving the goal posts backwards e.g. no new drilling till Q1 22 when well 3 was supposed to be underway in Q4 this year. All that does is just encourage more downward price pressure. 6-1 results are still not released, please god  let's hope there's something in those that really gets people excited, seismic has been confirmed as completed but no initial indication of what it shows, despite the fact it was being uploaded daily to the cloud, so they must have had a pretty good idea what it has been showing them for quite a few weeks now.Come on Reco. Can we get some positive news please that will see the shorts truly squeezed. They've had too much their own way for far too long now and it's starting to try the patience of us longs who have been following this journey very patiently for quite some time. #Go Reco  let's get this show back on the road "
40k trade does not even move the needle. GO got problems hedge fund problems.
To go shopping there?Never again. Sell or hold or do whatever you want.
Maybe $15 soon
"GO stock is quite the opportunity at these levels. This is a very well run company with the management team having been in place for many years and many more years to come. Seems like they are being unfairly downgraded because they are trying to overlap COVID sales spikes. Let's face it, they are not Costco. Having said that, there model offers consumers a hedge against inflation which is happening right now and is much worse than most people realize. this stock will be over 40 in the next business cycle. I have bought quite a bit and I am happy to wait this one out. great long term buy at these levels. value is alway good in bad times and good."
"Okay, not easy time for the stock. But why the company is so silent? Looks like it has no any supporter from big investors. Should we invest here having such attitude to real investors? Extremely poor positioning at the market for public company."
Whaaa? What's going on??
