Latest 13F shows institutions buying but no selling. The new 13F coming will likely show more of the same. I will continue to buy and hold.https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/go/institutional-holdings
Could any long timers please answer : stock moved to highs few months ago & then was wacked. Was the hit a result of weak Q3 #s? Reason?? Expansion or poor operating metrics? You folks like mgt? GO seems undervalued . Thanks for any insights. $31-$37 seems like solid level to establish position & add on weakness as wait for expansion results to kick in
Just sold some.. Hope i could buy back
"Grocery Outlet has existed for more than seven decades and went public this June. Quarterly filings with the Security and Exchange Commission reveal that the brand is growing: net sales increased to $645.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $575.1 million in the same time last year.The company expects net sales of $2.53 billion in 2019, up from $2.5 billion last year, and a net growth of 29 stores nationwide."

"why is this down, result seems ok to me. am i missing something"
"this is a good buy right now, no problem going back to $33-$34. I went to my local grocery outlet and was surprised by how many people were shopping there, I immediately decided that I wanted to invest. luckily, there was a sell off and was able to get in at a good price."

"This is a growth story with lots of room, and in time"
So CNBC talks up Slack (WORK) and they move up 8%. No talk much about Grocery Outlet and we get 35% gains. Look at the discount sector. All those stocks are high.
"Trying to pinpoint where, exactly to get into this. I doubt it goes under $100 but if it does, I'm going to pounce. I love these companies that plan on attacking the suburban and small town markets. $DASH $DG $GO are three great examples. Not every company can operate in these markets, but the ones that can will dominate in the future with the suburban revolution. I drive for DASH in my spare time. I hardly ever see an UberEats or GrubHub order in my market. DASH completely dominates."
I think GO does better when the market is down. Profitable since 1949. They know how to circumvent a downturn.

"Happened to stumble across this stock just now. Looks like a great entry point, yes? Or am I catching a falling knife?"
Long on GO
Any one on this board that thinks GO is near bottom?

"That was quite a hit yesterday. I knew the downturn in this stock was overdone. GO opening new stores everywhere. Inflation will draw more people to these discount stores such as ALDI-Dollar Tree-Smart and Final-99 cent stores, Ross, Walmart, etc."
"I have been shopping at GO for over 40 years here in California. It is always a treasure hunt. Prices on unfamiliar items are often so cheap that they are worth a try. Gourmet foods I would never otherwise buy also become a bargain. Once a convinced shopper there, you never change despite your income going up or down. Half the fun is going in the stores to discover new items to try. If you want to stick to the same old brands selling the same old stuff, go elsewhere - not me, nor any of my many friends who go the GO nearby. We even shop at other GO stores in other cities if we can find them. They don't all carry the same items."
"40 is our base, that's established. Buy more if you can. I maxed out but will add all along. Dollar cost average works over time."
What a jewel ! This is a long term keeper.

"The unique business model where owners are independent operators and GO shares in the profits is actually very good. As an independent owner of a Sear's Catalog store in the early 1990s , my wife and I did quite well. Having a stake in the company's success makes owners eager sale associates. I bought GO to hold long term."
Do anyone have a thought that the meeting with Dr.Hahn and Mr.Erck could be about NANOFLU filing and get it approve before the Flu season start so they can prevent people from ending up in ER.. i mean Nanoflu will help them alot to know if its a Flu not Covid19.. glta.. #Go Nvax
"I get the pullback, but now they are worth less than before the pandemic? This is overdone."
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
Q4 net EPS is 24 cents and only met the low estimate but growth and comp sales are impressive. I think we should look beyond that and keep going.
"Don't see any down side risk from this price. 33.75 is the new assigned sale price of secondary shares. Being GO is down from lofty highs , these shares should move easily."
Bought GO back in June. Only bought 1000 shares. Sold half at $45.26. Bought in at $29.77. Still think they have more room to run. Good Luck Longs.
Great concept and store expansion execution but dilution and high debt levels are concerning.
$25 tomorrow ?
Great report. The conference call will decide where it's going.
Nike did not provide guidance yet it is up AH knowing they will have a bad next report. GO does the same but knowing they will have a strong next report and it tanks. S M H

"We have a Grocery Outlet in Palo Alto. I figure its how the poorer students at Stanford (are there any?) make ends meet. They sell a lot of stuff that is close to its expiration date. I look for the items < $1.00 to find the real ""priced to move"" bargains. I always enjoy shopping there because their business model causes them to rotate brands and prices all the time. Just stay away from the rootbeer-flavored poptarts, they are NOT A GOOD DEAL even at 5c/tart! Trust me - I know!"
Shorted at $34 1k shares and still waiting to cover. I hope on may 11 earnings day GO goes lower and I close my short.
Yesterday was a gift for those that did`nt buy the IPO. I added and wish I had picked up more. I love shopping at these stores.https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4653046
Market up. What about GO?
Hello S&P 400

"GO is growing their business model right for long sustained growth. By creating good value for customers, maintaining a profit, but increasing revenues widely to expand their foot print. A model that takes pages from McDonald's and Dollar tree. Give it time."

"anybody can translate what the earnings mean, us the predictions?"
All supermarkets- food stocks are up and currently most of them are GREEN. The GO stock is notparticipated in the food stocks rally and it is not far from 52 week low. It is so OVERSOLD and shouldbe rebounding very soon or at the market close today.The GO stock should be heading back between $28 to $29.50 near term so I am accumulating the undervaluedstock and taking advantage of the sell off to buy at this great deep discount prices....
"They met revenues, beat EPS by 4 cents (0.21 vs. 0.17 expected). To be fair with the rest of the markets, GO pulled out their guidance for the current quarter. Those who went to the stores, we all know they will have strong one on the next report. The longer the restaurants closure goes, the better is GO's position."
why the stock is down after a good earning
(GO) starting to eat (pun intended) into walmart sales -- GO GO
That Cramer!!!!
I’m in! Can’t believe it’s at $35
This store has seen more foot traffic because of what's going on but it will continue to get that constant flow of customers going to their stores since more people will be on unemployment or have less money to spend and still have to feed their families. Good recession stock.
GO will be back above 44 within 2 weeks.
Thinking about buying into GO as a long term investment. Seems like a good bet if there is a recession. my local GO is always busy. Wide variety of customers looking for good deals. I know I enjoy the bargain hunting. Encouraged by the revenue growth.Whats the long term bear case?
Selling pressure continue!
Only 26 M shares available? May be this is great for retail investors... It can go to 70s in no time...
they can still save face by saying on the CC that they will beat the current guidance but will not provide numbers because of the uncertainty of CV on shoppers behavior.
"I call this a stealth stock. Very few follow it. Name is not familiar to most. If you live in the west coast you know who grocery outlet is. This is ground floor op like Costco. Dollar tree Aldies sells knock off items - not name brand. Best bargain mkt in Cali. I shop Trader Joe’s , Costco, amd grocery outlet. NOSH items are huge with younger folk. Kroger is a joke compared to this company. Buffetbought the wrong stock /Even billionaires can be out of the loop. He says he missed amazon. Enough said"
I trade this stock. GO is expanding everywhere and will thrive over the years.
Picked up at 38
visited a couple of my local GO stores. both said they had record breaking sales record the past two weeks. earnings tomorrow should be a slam dunk as well as guidance. I expect a 20% jump after hours tomorrow

as corona spreads people are flocking to Grocery Outlets to stockpile. As Covid drives the market down it's going to drive GO up. Good luck longs!
It boggles the mind that people think the success or failure of this company long term somehow hinges on “covid shoppers” LOL. It’s laughable. Right now this company is on sale and I’m loading the wheelbarrow.

35 tomorrow!!!!!
What's your time horizon ? Next Week ? Forget it. GO is a long term buy. I rarely look anymore but very comfortable with my purchase. They laughed at Dollar Tree. Corny but successful.
bought on the dip.... good company
Lol...GO reporting earnings today and no one has been on this board. I must be the only s/h left.
DJ-7 days ago Goldman Sachs raised the price target on GO to $43.00. At that time the stock was trading at $36.31. The secondary was $34.00 and the stock shot up to $38.00. Now you can buy the stock under the secondary below $33.00.

"We are a high-growth, extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products sold through a network of independently operated stores. Each of our stores offers a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience in an easy-to-navigate, small-box format. An ever-changing assortment of “WOW!” deals, complemented by everyday staple products, generates customer excitement and encourages frequent visits from bargain-minded shoppers. Our flexible buying model allows us to offer quality, name-brand opportunistic products at prices generally 40% to 70% below those of conventional retailers. Entrepreneurial independent operators (“IOs”) run our stores and create a neighborhood feel through personalized customer service and a localized product offering. This differentiated approach has driven 15 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth. Our founder, Jim Read, pioneered our opportunistic buying model in 1946 and subsequently developed the IO selling approach, which harnesses individual entrepreneurship and local decision-making to better serve our customers. Underlying this differentiated model was a mission that still guides us today: “Touching Lives for the Better.” Since 2006, the third generation of Read family leadership has advanced this mission and accelerated growth by strengthening our supplier relationships, introducing new product categories and expanding the store base from 128 to 323 stores across the West Coast and Pennsylvania. These efforts have more than tripled sales from approximately $640 million in 2006 to $2.3 billion in 2018, representing an 11% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). Our passionate, founding family-led management team remains a driving force behind our growth-oriented culture. Our differentiated model for buying and selling delivers a “WOW!” shopping experience, which generates customer excitement, inspires loyalty and supports profitable sales growth: • How we buy: We source quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products opportunistically through a large, centralized purchasing team that leverages long-standing and actively managed supplier relationships to acquire merchandise at significant discounts. Our speed and efficiency in responding to supplier needs, combined with our specialized supply chain capabilities and flexible merchandising strategy, enhance our access to discounted products and allow us to turn inventory quickly and profitably. Our buyers proactively source on-trend products based on changing consumer preferences, including a wide selection of Natural, Organic, Specialty and Healthy (“NOSH”) products. We also source everyday staple products to complement our opportunistic offerings. We purchase over 85,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) from approximately 1,500 suppliers annually. Each store offers a curated and ever-changing assortment of approximately 5,000 SKUs, creating a “buy now” sense of urgency that promotes return visits and fosters customer loyalty. • How we sell: Our stores are independently operated by entrepreneurial small business owners who have a relentless focus on selecting the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. Unlike a store manager of a traditional retailer, IOs are independent businesses and are responsible for store operations, including ordering, merchandising and managing inventory, marketing locally and directly hiring, training and employing their store workers. IOs initially contribute capital to establish their business and share store-level gross profits with us. These factors both align our interests and incentivize IOs to aggressively grow their business to realize substantial financial upside. This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing scale and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate. Our value proposition has broad appeal with bargain-minded customers across all income levels, demographics and geographies. Customers visited our stores over 85 million times in 2018 with the average customer shopping twice per month and spending over $25 per transaction. We believe that our sustained focus on delivering ever-changing “WOW!” deals within a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment has generated strong customer loyalty and brand affinity. This customer enthusiasm is evidenced by our high scores on surveys designed to measure customer experience of our brand and 11 consecutive years of positive comparable store traffic growth. We believe that our broad customer appeal supports significant new store growth opportunities, and we plan to continue to expand our reach to additional customers and geographies across the United States. Our stores have performed well across all economic cycles, as demonstrated by our 15 consecutive years of positive https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1085482-89659"

A very good sigh when these guys buy.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-welcomed-grocery-outlet-211431436.html
CNBC indicates a lot of premarket GO trades this AM.
"The business model GO operates under can be very successful. They buy lower quality grocery items that other large chains refuse to sell. They get these products dirt cheap, as they would have ended up in the dumpster otherwise, and they can turn a pretty profit. In fact, believe it or not, they are one of the only chains that can turn a profit off groceries. Walmart and Target use groceries to attract customers in hopes they will buy other items while in the store, which is where they really make their money, but they barely turn a profit from the grocery section.The scavenger hunt theme (customers never know what they will find in the store, as inventory continually changes based on what GO can get) has been made successful by other companies such as Costco and Five Below. It keeps customers coming back. The only worry I have moving forward is the lack of e-commerce presence. Not sure how you can sell groceries online, but counting on the brick & mortar way of business has spelled extinction for other retailers. We will see if GO can get away with it."
"This is possibly a takeover target , or at least a turnaround play ."
Grocery Outlet is a strong hedge against bad times. A dollar has to go a long way for many folks. I like to get bargains too.

Nothing to worry about people. Price manipulation for options call expired on the 19th. But looks like it’s running out of downside. Nowhere but up from here!

GO 's EPS earnings were matched with concensus but the markets was looking for more......and the GO stockwas sold off big time. Take advantage of today's sell and start accumulating GO share as it will come backat least 28.50 this week or earlier next week. It hit 52 week low and currently sitting in the oversold condition.I am a buyer of GO to take advantage of this deep discount and its oversold condition.......
"I was encouraged by how aggressively GO is paying down debt. The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2019 with $462.5 million in total debt, compared to $709.1 million at the end of the same period in 2018. Holding this stock for long term."
The GDRP becomes enforceable in May 2018. It applies to controllers and processors of data. May 25th is the Deadline. The Company will be officially in a Higher Category Moving the Share Price a lot Higher. This Company is so Undervalued. The float is Extremely Low here. It’s insane $GO AXXA $

Someone knows earning outcome may be bad and sold it. It’s considered inside info. Investigation needed.

People standing in line before opening. GO is doing something right.https://www.kitsapdailynews.com/news/grocery-outlet-opens-new-port-orchard-store-with-a-flourish/

Look at Lidl. They are growing fast. Deep discounting. GO looks compelling.
Either I'm impatient which is definitely true or this stock truly is a laggard. With all indexes up for almost a week now this stock has slowly traded downward. Amazing momentum upward but still no sign of good news for this stock. It formed a cup and now its handle and it's now dipping further which spells disaster. Disappointing in this stock and I advise anyone to stay away until the presidential debates/election. This stock is falling daily on no news and low volume just a pure laggard
..what happened
I think this heading under $30.
Just loaded up more shares at $33.45. Anything under $34 is a great value here IMO.

"I believed in this stock since day 1, FYI. I bought today prior to earnings report with All my money and All my margin/day trade buying power. tomorrow shall be an exciting day!"
"Sector rotation and safe haven going to $KR and $GO as funds look for safety and market focus. UNFI isn't benefiting from any of this, as we were warned about CEO succession disarray and now the crippling results ( more than soft) of the current EXPO Food Show are very telling . August 1st marks the 4 year anniversary of the 'infamous 1 for 7 reverse stock split' of Supervalu which was key to the UNFI takeover. This concludes one of the most shady and villainous eras of the food distribution space in recent memory. Less than two weeks to go in the FY and it is the 'Shoot out at the OK Corral', as either we name an elite 'outsider' to unlock shareholder value and MOVE ON ..... or more 'inside' do nothing- ism and more financial shenanigans."
