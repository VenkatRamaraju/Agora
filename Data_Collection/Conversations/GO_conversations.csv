visited a couple of my local GO stores. both said they had record breaking sales record the past two weeks. earnings tomorrow should be a slam dunk as well as guidance. I expect a 20% jump after hours tomorrow
Any one on this board that thinks GO is near bottom?
GO has been steady climbing since ipo ....its a keeper
50% of Market Cap is gone in last number of months. Is it going to lose another 50% now?
strong fundamentals + sticky new customers will raise long term prospects
Today is day to buy more!
Maybe $15 soon
"Don't see any down side risk from this price. 33.75 is the new assigned sale price of secondary shares. Being GO is down from lofty highs , these shares should move easily."
the real news will be in hollywood! #go long
Sell on Tuesday continue.
Is $50 possible?
lets make it quick NVAX friends.. one quiestion and answer it in couple words please.. i say please okay.. WHAT ADVICES WILL YOU TELL SHORTS TO DO BEFORE PHASE I RESULTS? #GO NVAX
Latest 13F shows institutions buying but no selling. The new 13F coming will likely show more of the same. I will continue to buy and hold.https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/go/institutional-holdings
CNBC indicates a lot of premarket GO trades this AM.
Add under $41.00 if you see it again
Look at Lidl. They are growing fast. Deep discounting. GO looks compelling.
"We are a high-growth, extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products sold through a network of independently operated stores. Each of our stores offers a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience in an easy-to-navigate, small-box format. An ever-changing assortment of “WOW!” deals, complemented by everyday staple products, generates customer excitement and encourages frequent visits from bargain-minded shoppers. Our flexible buying model allows us to offer quality, name-brand opportunistic products at prices generally 40% to 70% below those of conventional retailers. Entrepreneurial independent operators (“IOs”) run our stores and create a neighborhood feel through personalized customer service and a localized product offering. This differentiated approach has driven 15 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth. Our founder, Jim Read, pioneered our opportunistic buying model in 1946 and subsequently developed the IO selling approach, which harnesses individual entrepreneurship and local decision-making to better serve our customers. Underlying this differentiated model was a mission that still guides us today: “Touching Lives for the Better.” Since 2006, the third generation of Read family leadership has advanced this mission and accelerated growth by strengthening our supplier relationships, introducing new product categories and expanding the store base from 128 to 323 stores across the West Coast and Pennsylvania. These efforts have more than tripled sales from approximately $640 million in 2006 to $2.3 billion in 2018, representing an 11% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). Our passionate, founding family-led management team remains a driving force behind our growth-oriented culture. Our differentiated model for buying and selling delivers a “WOW!” shopping experience, which generates customer excitement, inspires loyalty and supports profitable sales growth: • How we buy: We source quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products opportunistically through a large, centralized purchasing team that leverages long-standing and actively managed supplier relationships to acquire merchandise at significant discounts. Our speed and efficiency in responding to supplier needs, combined with our specialized supply chain capabilities and flexible merchandising strategy, enhance our access to discounted products and allow us to turn inventory quickly and profitably. Our buyers proactively source on-trend products based on changing consumer preferences, including a wide selection of Natural, Organic, Specialty and Healthy (“NOSH”) products. We also source everyday staple products to complement our opportunistic offerings. We purchase over 85,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) from approximately 1,500 suppliers annually. Each store offers a curated and ever-changing assortment of approximately 5,000 SKUs, creating a “buy now” sense of urgency that promotes return visits and fosters customer loyalty. • How we sell: Our stores are independently operated by entrepreneurial small business owners who have a relentless focus on selecting the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. Unlike a store manager of a traditional retailer, IOs are independent businesses and are responsible for store operations, including ordering, merchandising and managing inventory, marketing locally and directly hiring, training and employing their store workers. IOs initially contribute capital to establish their business and share store-level gross profits with us. These factors both align our interests and incentivize IOs to aggressively grow their business to realize substantial financial upside. This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing scale and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate. Our value proposition has broad appeal with bargain-minded customers across all income levels, demographics and geographies. Customers visited our stores over 85 million times in 2018 with the average customer shopping twice per month and spending over $25 per transaction. We believe that our sustained focus on delivering ever-changing “WOW!” deals within a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment has generated strong customer loyalty and brand affinity. This customer enthusiasm is evidenced by our high scores on surveys designed to measure customer experience of our brand and 11 consecutive years of positive comparable store traffic growth. We believe that our broad customer appeal supports significant new store growth opportunities, and we plan to continue to expand our reach to additional customers and geographies across the United States. Our stores have performed well across all economic cycles, as demonstrated by our 15 consecutive years of positive https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1085482-89659"
"The unique business model where owners are independent operators and GO shares in the profits is actually very good. As an independent owner of a Sear's Catalog store in the early 1990s , my wife and I did quite well. Having a stake in the company's success makes owners eager sale associates. I bought GO to hold long term."

Anyone know when earnings will be released?
Q4 net EPS is 24 cents and only met the low estimate but growth and comp sales are impressive. I think we should look beyond that and keep going.
52 week low today. There's your sign. Take out what you have left.
"I like that Puration at least tries to make money, unlike many other cannabis related stocks. #Go Pura!"
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
"GO stock is quite the opportunity at these levels. This is a very well run company with the management team having been in place for many years and many more years to come. Seems like they are being unfairly downgraded because they are trying to overlap COVID sales spikes. Let's face it, they are not Costco. Having said that, there model offers consumers a hedge against inflation which is happening right now and is much worse than most people realize. this stock will be over 40 in the next business cycle. I have bought quite a bit and I am happy to wait this one out. great long term buy at these levels. value is alway good in bad times and good."
This store has seen more foot traffic because of what's going on but it will continue to get that constant flow of customers going to their stores since more people will be on unemployment or have less money to spend and still have to feed their families. Good recession stock.

The Go Grocery in San Leandro is great. Go there at least once a week. A little out of my way but worth it.
Its going to come down some more...
"Sector rotation and safe haven going to $KR and $GO as funds look for safety and market focus. UNFI isn't benefiting from any of this, as we were warned about CEO succession disarray and now the crippling results ( more than soft) of the current EXPO Food Show are very telling . August 1st marks the 4 year anniversary of the 'infamous 1 for 7 reverse stock split' of Supervalu which was key to the UNFI takeover. This concludes one of the most shady and villainous eras of the food distribution space in recent memory. Less than two weeks to go in the FY and it is the 'Shoot out at the OK Corral', as either we name an elite 'outsider' to unlock shareholder value and MOVE ON ..... or more 'inside' do nothing- ism and more financial shenanigans."
wondering why GO not trading $10-$15 in this market sell off?may be after earning report?its still near to its IPO price.
Yesterday was a gift for those that did`nt buy the IPO. I added and wish I had picked up more. I love shopping at these stores.https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4653046
"It will be $100 in 10 years or so. footnote see profit margin, debt, EPS."
"Happened to stumble across this stock just now. Looks like a great entry point, yes? Or am I catching a falling knife?"
"If the company can afford itself all those things that we may look at the chart, it's clear on which level they are able to manage their stores."
"Merrill Lynch & Morgan Stanley are waiving lock-up on 933,000 GO shares. Those shares will be DONATED to CHARITABLE CAUSES. Those include shares held by Eric Lindberg. A noble endeavor and a refreshing reason to buy more. I like GO !"
"Grocery Outlet in Seaside, Ca. has organic vanilla Humboldt ice cream. My favorite stop !"
Depth charts are impressive. #go tron
Sector rotation and all supermarket and food stock are GREEN and some hit 52 week high as of now.ACI: +.51 (52 week HI)KR : +.16 ( near 52 week HI)UNFI: previous RED and turn GREEN +.04SYY: +.80CAG: +.25KHC: +.42and many more........Should take advantage to the GO stock sell and start accumulating as consumer staples sector is receivinga lot of interests from Money Managers right now.....
Thinking about buying into GO as a long term investment. Seems like a good bet if there is a recession. my local GO is always busy. Wide variety of customers looking for good deals. I know I enjoy the bargain hunting. Encouraged by the revenue growth.Whats the long term bear case?
Secondary shares priced @ 33.75. Good not cheap.
Go to 40 by friday
Whaaa? What's going on??
Everyone who owns GO is losing money now unless your an insider selling shares that cost them nothing
"In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are waiving a lock-up restriction with respect to 933,000 shares of the Company’s common stock held by H&F Globe Investor LP and an entity affiliated with the Company’s CEO, Eric Lindberg. The shares held by H&F Globe Investor LP are expected to be distributed to certain parties affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC, including certain directors of the Company, and subsequently donated to charitable organizations. The shares held by the entity affiliated with Eric Lindberg are also expected to be donated to a charitable organization. This waiver will take effect on October 8, 2019, and the shares may be sold or otherwise transferred on or after such date."
"Any one know what is going on with Grocery Outlet ? So many mixed messages on their 'business model' and insiders are always selling and it just doesn't look right . Cant find a reason to 'hold ' or 'buy ' Headed to under ? ? Somebody ,Anybody ~ Please advise !"
"I have been shopping at GO for over 40 years here in California. It is always a treasure hunt. Prices on unfamiliar items are often so cheap that they are worth a try. Gourmet foods I would never otherwise buy also become a bargain. Once a convinced shopper there, you never change despite your income going up or down. Half the fun is going in the stores to discover new items to try. If you want to stick to the same old brands selling the same old stuff, go elsewhere - not me, nor any of my many friends who go the GO nearby. We even shop at other GO stores in other cities if we can find them. They don't all carry the same items."
"As expected, many food stocks in the consumer staple sector are GREEN:BJ: +1.50KR: +.35ACI: .06SPTN: +.06MANY MORE.....GO stock should start GREEN TODAY AS WELL. Currently sitting in the oversoldcondition and should be rebounding......"
Hello S&P 400
"Hey Sean, Great show. Very to the point and informative. #Go Team Namaste"
Hello all! Just bought a bit of this. Seems seriously underpriced... GLTA!
"Sector rotations: There are some interests in the consumer staples which GO belongs to.Food stocks are earlier sold off and they are now GREEN and GO should follow soon.ACI: +.40USFD: +.28PFGC: +.35SPTN: +.1055GO is again oversold since yesterday and currently sitting in the oversold condition and it should reboundsoon. Hit 52 week low yesterday and rebound,.... I am a buyer of GO today.....It is so undervalued and a greatbargain at this discounts..... Should rebound to at least $28.50 this week or earlier next week...."
If GO doesn't get some kind of a bounce soon One will be forced to think it not at bottom yet. Seems to be no urgency to create or add to position
Looking good. Bought in the mid $30s.
Tomorrow will be more than $35! Momentum  #Go #Work
Shorted at $34 1k shares and still waiting to cover. I hope on may 11 earnings day GO goes lower and I close my short.
To go shopping there?Never again. Sell or hold or do whatever you want.
Shop at GO in my area but visit other stores when I can. It is a fun treasure hunt. go GO.

Safe stock to be in should the economy contract. 15 years straight profitable. An impressive track record.
Someone knows earning outcome may be bad and sold it. It’s considered inside info. Investigation needed.

Strong finish second day in a row. Well Well are we in the run for a strong finish tomorrow. Lets just finish around 80. This is looking very good. The bottom as been reach no need to argue its around .70. Just buy the dip and relax. The tutes are in. By the way Montreal is buzzing #GO HABS GO Habs and PBX sound very good. Cheers.
With all the restaurants and other business going out and unemployment. GO is the clear choice! Loading up today!
This thing is getting annihilated day after week after month. What do they expect to do This is now attracting short sellers like flies on p0op. Not a pretty picture. 4 and 5% moves just today
"I was encouraged by how aggressively GO is paying down debt. The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2019 with $462.5 million in total debt, compared to $709.1 million at the end of the same period in 2018. Holding this stock for long term."
"if you can't make profit as a discount grocery store during a pandemic when the restaurants are closed, you are run by completely incompetent management"
Great numbers. +$40 by end of week I hope!
GO 's EPS earnings were matched with concensus but the markets was looking for more......and the GO stockwas sold off big time. Take advantage of today's sell and start accumulating GO share as it will come backat least 28.50 this week or earlier next week. It hit 52 week low and currently sitting in the oversold condition.I am a buyer of GO to take advantage of this deep discount and its oversold condition.......
Grocery Outlet Holding is down 5.40% to 29.26
"UP on a down day. CRWD , #GO , #MGI"
"Sorry folks this past month is my fault. I found a beautiful trading pattern in this stock and started trading it and it immediately broke pattern and became a dog. I will be out at $42 and this should rocket once I leave if 2020 over all has been any indication of my “touch” in the market this year. Some people have the Midas touch, I seem to have the Murphy’s touch.."
"We have a Grocery Outlet in Palo Alto. I figure its how the poorer students at Stanford (are there any?) make ends meet. They sell a lot of stuff that is close to its expiration date. I look for the items < $1.00 to find the real ""priced to move"" bargains. I always enjoy shopping there because their business model causes them to rotate brands and prices all the time. Just stay away from the rootbeer-flavored poptarts, they are NOT A GOOD DEAL even at 5c/tart! Trust me - I know!"
Could any long timers please answer : stock moved to highs few months ago & then was wacked. Was the hit a result of weak Q3 #s? Reason?? Expansion or poor operating metrics? You folks like mgt? GO seems undervalued . Thanks for any insights. $31-$37 seems like solid level to establish position & add on weakness as wait for expansion results to kick in
"This is a growth story with lots of room, and in time"
I wish Alex D would button his beak.
Waiting for better entry.

"CONSUMER STAPLE SECTOR IS UP AND CURRENTLY 2ND PERFORMANCE IN ALL SECTORS RIGHT NOW.""GO"" stock is part of the consumer staple and is selling off again. It should be in green shortly as allfood stocks are GREEN right now. I am a buyer of GO stock as it is in the oversold condition again."
Just loaded up more shares at $33.45. Anything under $34 is a great value here IMO.
Hooray! I'm losing money again!
Today was just heading toward first base for a Home run with Namaste. #Go Team Namaste
..what happened
There are some people here who bought at low 30s.
Selling pressure continue!
All supermarkets- food stocks are up and currently most of them are GREEN. The GO stock is notparticipated in the food stocks rally and it is not far from 52 week low. It is so OVERSOLD and shouldbe rebounding very soon or at the market close today.The GO stock should be heading back between $28 to $29.50 near term so I am accumulating the undervaluedstock and taking advantage of the sell off to buy at this great deep discount prices....
Going to 90 by end of year
"GO is growing their business model right for long sustained growth. By creating good value for customers, maintaining a profit, but increasing revenues widely to expand their foot print. A model that takes pages from McDonald's and Dollar tree. Give it time."
It boggles the mind that people think the success or failure of this company long term somehow hinges on “covid shoppers” LOL. It’s laughable. Right now this company is on sale and I’m loading the wheelbarrow.
GO Baby GO
"Markets sell off today will make money managers moving their monies into a safe heaven, which consumersector i.e...food stocks. Expect GO stock do very well today....."
I'll be in at $26.5
"Grocery Outlet has existed for more than seven decades and went public this June. Quarterly filings with the Security and Exchange Commission reveal that the brand is growing: net sales increased to $645.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $575.1 million in the same time last year.The company expects net sales of $2.53 billion in 2019, up from $2.5 billion last year, and a net growth of 29 stores nationwide."
"Got in yesterday under $31. I LOVE this company over the long term. Recession-proof and good for millenials who are short on cash. One of the few stores that can beat Wal Marts prices, out of Amazons industry, and offers a scavenger hunt model that brings customers to the store that has been used successfully by Five Below and Costco already."
"The business model GO operates under can be very successful. They buy lower quality grocery items that other large chains refuse to sell. They get these products dirt cheap, as they would have ended up in the dumpster otherwise, and they can turn a pretty profit. In fact, believe it or not, they are one of the only chains that can turn a profit off groceries. Walmart and Target use groceries to attract customers in hopes they will buy other items while in the store, which is where they really make their money, but they barely turn a profit from the grocery section.The scavenger hunt theme (customers never know what they will find in the store, as inventory continually changes based on what GO can get) has been made successful by other companies such as Costco and Five Below. It keeps customers coming back. The only worry I have moving forward is the lack of e-commerce presence. Not sure how you can sell groceries online, but counting on the brick & mortar way of business has spelled extinction for other retailers. We will see if GO can get away with it."

"Trying to pinpoint where, exactly to get into this. I doubt it goes under $100 but if it does, I'm going to pounce. I love these companies that plan on attacking the suburban and small town markets. $DASH $DG $GO are three great examples. Not every company can operate in these markets, but the ones that can will dominate in the future with the suburban revolution. I drive for DASH in my spare time. I hardly ever see an UberEats or GrubHub order in my market. DASH completely dominates."
"this is a good buy right now, no problem going back to $33-$34. I went to my local grocery outlet and was surprised by how many people were shopping there, I immediately decided that I wanted to invest. luckily, there was a sell off and was able to get in at a good price."
Go up even on low volume. Wait till volume picks up.$50 next week.
"40 is our base, that's established. Buy more if you can. I maxed out but will add all along. Dollar cost average works over time."

Every person who bought this stock has lost money. Board of Directors can be proud of the fact they cheated the public
What a jewel ! This is a long term keeper.
"We need a better PR department... great company, expending 30+ stores per year..."
Grocery Outlet is a strong hedge against bad times. A dollar has to go a long way for many folks. I like to get bargains too.
"Okay, not easy time for the stock. But why the company is so silent? Looks like it has no any supporter from big investors. Should we invest here having such attitude to real investors? Extremely poor positioning at the market for public company."
One rather large trade went thru earlier. Volume is high and that problem in this situation
