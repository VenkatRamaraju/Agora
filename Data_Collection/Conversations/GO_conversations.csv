visited a couple of my local GO stores. both said they had record breaking sales record the past two weeks. earnings tomorrow should be a slam dunk as well as guidance. I expect a 20% jump after hours tomorrow
I wish Alex D would button his beak.
I'M SAYING 1/4 REPORT WILL NOT BE GOOD.....IMHO..WE WILL SEE NEXT WEEK...I SOLD.
I trade this stock. GO is expanding everywhere and will thrive over the years.
This stock shot up 8 bucks in 11 days. It reminds me of PLNT when they were opening new locations across the U S and beyond. The secondary of $34.00 was a good entry point but it went to $31.00 after the announcement. If you were lucky enough to bite you are sitting on a quick profit. The markets decline has not caused a dip in this stock. I think this just might be a long hold with numberous stores scheduled to open in Oregon and California. Bargain stores will do well in this economy where people need to stretch their dollars.
With all the hoarding Grocery Stores are making many X times their normal sales.
"In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are waiving a lock-up restriction with respect to 933,000 shares of the Company’s common stock held by H&F Globe Investor LP and an entity affiliated with the Company’s CEO, Eric Lindberg. The shares held by H&F Globe Investor LP are expected to be distributed to certain parties affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC, including certain directors of the Company, and subsequently donated to charitable organizations. The shares held by the entity affiliated with Eric Lindberg are also expected to be donated to a charitable organization. This waiver will take effect on October 8, 2019, and the shares may be sold or otherwise transferred on or after such date."
What a jewel ! This is a long term keeper.
"Good Morning Folks, should be a great day  #Go Team Namaste !!!!"
"Added on the dip this morning, nice steady recovery."
#GO NAMASTE #LONG and STRONG
Go to 40 by friday
as corona spreads people are flocking to Grocery Outlets to stockpile. As Covid drives the market down it's going to drive GO up. Good luck longs!
"The business model GO operates under can be very successful. They buy lower quality grocery items that other large chains refuse to sell. They get these products dirt cheap, as they would have ended up in the dumpster otherwise, and they can turn a pretty profit. In fact, believe it or not, they are one of the only chains that can turn a profit off groceries. Walmart and Target use groceries to attract customers in hopes they will buy other items while in the store, which is where they really make their money, but they barely turn a profit from the grocery section.The scavenger hunt theme (customers never know what they will find in the store, as inventory continually changes based on what GO can get) has been made successful by other companies such as Costco and Five Below. It keeps customers coming back. The only worry I have moving forward is the lack of e-commerce presence. Not sure how you can sell groceries online, but counting on the brick & mortar way of business has spelled extinction for other retailers. We will see if GO can get away with it."
So did the other news channels warn you zoomie gave your info to China so they get zooom in china not good for z but great $for #go to one American news see the news
People standing in line before opening. GO is doing something right.https://www.kitsapdailynews.com/news/grocery-outlet-opens-new-port-orchard-store-with-a-flourish/
..what happened
wondering why GO not trading $10-$15 in this market sell off?may be after earning report?its still near to its IPO price.
"15 straight years of profitable quarters. GroceryOutlet is here to stay. They retired a huge part of their debt with the IPO money. Don't worry, just buy."
"anybody can translate what the earnings mean, us the predictions?"
The GDRP becomes enforceable in May 2018. It applies to controllers and processors of data. May 25th is the Deadline. The Company will be officially in a Higher Category Moving the Share Price a lot Higher. This Company is so Undervalued. The float is Extremely Low here. It’s insane $GO AXXA $
Nice er. Break out tomorrow. Funds will go inside
bought on the dip.... good company
$GO not a $TJX more like $SFS IPO overpriced at $22
"It will be $100 in 10 years or so. footnote see profit margin, debt, EPS."
Its going to come down some more...
The only thing I see green today is my yard needs to be cut. I think massive quantities of alcohol will be required. Try to have a good evening folks. #Go Team Namaste.
Just sold some.. Hope i could buy back
Looking good. Bought in the mid $30s.
"As expected, many food stocks in the consumer staple sector are GREEN:BJ: +1.50KR: +.35ACI: .06SPTN: +.06MANY MORE.....GO stock should start GREEN TODAY AS WELL. Currently sitting in the oversoldcondition and should be rebounding......"
"We have several in San Diego area, including one 1 mile away. Shop there a couple times a week. Solid business model, filling a niche, with great savings. Long and adding more."
"Shorts compromise less than 2% of GO. Risky and bold to short. Shorts better hope GO sells off a little. I'll just hold long and relax. 15 straight years of profitable sales , cash on hand , debt being paid down, and new storefronts opening."
"Grocery Outlet in Seaside, Ca. has organic vanilla Humboldt ice cream. My favorite stop !"
Add under $41.00 if you see it again
Great concept and store expansion execution but dilution and high debt levels are concerning.

CNBC indicates a lot of premarket GO trades this AM.
It boggles the mind that people think the success or failure of this company long term somehow hinges on “covid shoppers” LOL. It’s laughable. Right now this company is on sale and I’m loading the wheelbarrow.

Could any long timers please answer : stock moved to highs few months ago & then was wacked. Was the hit a result of weak Q3 #s? Reason?? Expansion or poor operating metrics? You folks like mgt? GO seems undervalued . Thanks for any insights. $31-$37 seems like solid level to establish position & add on weakness as wait for expansion results to kick in
This store has seen more foot traffic because of what's going on but it will continue to get that constant flow of customers going to their stores since more people will be on unemployment or have less money to spend and still have to feed their families. Good recession stock.
Do anyone have a thought that the meeting with Dr.Hahn and Mr.Erck could be about NANOFLU filing and get it approve before the Flu season start so they can prevent people from ending up in ER.. i mean Nanoflu will help them alot to know if its a Flu not Covid19.. glta.. #Go Nvax
"I have been shopping at GO for over 40 years here in California. It is always a treasure hunt. Prices on unfamiliar items are often so cheap that they are worth a try. Gourmet foods I would never otherwise buy also become a bargain. Once a convinced shopper there, you never change despite your income going up or down. Half the fun is going in the stores to discover new items to try. If you want to stick to the same old brands selling the same old stuff, go elsewhere - not me, nor any of my many friends who go the GO nearby. We even shop at other GO stores in other cities if we can find them. They don't all carry the same items."
Nothing to worry about people. Price manipulation for options call expired on the 19th. But looks like it’s running out of downside. Nowhere but up from here!

"This is a growth story with lots of room, and in time"
"We are a high-growth, extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products sold through a network of independently operated stores. Each of our stores offers a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience in an easy-to-navigate, small-box format. An ever-changing assortment of “WOW!” deals, complemented by everyday staple products, generates customer excitement and encourages frequent visits from bargain-minded shoppers. Our flexible buying model allows us to offer quality, name-brand opportunistic products at prices generally 40% to 70% below those of conventional retailers. Entrepreneurial independent operators (“IOs”) run our stores and create a neighborhood feel through personalized customer service and a localized product offering. This differentiated approach has driven 15 consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth. Our founder, Jim Read, pioneered our opportunistic buying model in 1946 and subsequently developed the IO selling approach, which harnesses individual entrepreneurship and local decision-making to better serve our customers. Underlying this differentiated model was a mission that still guides us today: “Touching Lives for the Better.” Since 2006, the third generation of Read family leadership has advanced this mission and accelerated growth by strengthening our supplier relationships, introducing new product categories and expanding the store base from 128 to 323 stores across the West Coast and Pennsylvania. These efforts have more than tripled sales from approximately $640 million in 2006 to $2.3 billion in 2018, representing an 11% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). Our passionate, founding family-led management team remains a driving force behind our growth-oriented culture. Our differentiated model for buying and selling delivers a “WOW!” shopping experience, which generates customer excitement, inspires loyalty and supports profitable sales growth: • How we buy: We source quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products opportunistically through a large, centralized purchasing team that leverages long-standing and actively managed supplier relationships to acquire merchandise at significant discounts. Our speed and efficiency in responding to supplier needs, combined with our specialized supply chain capabilities and flexible merchandising strategy, enhance our access to discounted products and allow us to turn inventory quickly and profitably. Our buyers proactively source on-trend products based on changing consumer preferences, including a wide selection of Natural, Organic, Specialty and Healthy (“NOSH”) products. We also source everyday staple products to complement our opportunistic offerings. We purchase over 85,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) from approximately 1,500 suppliers annually. Each store offers a curated and ever-changing assortment of approximately 5,000 SKUs, creating a “buy now” sense of urgency that promotes return visits and fosters customer loyalty. • How we sell: Our stores are independently operated by entrepreneurial small business owners who have a relentless focus on selecting the best products for their communities, providing personalized customer service and driving improved store performance. Unlike a store manager of a traditional retailer, IOs are independent businesses and are responsible for store operations, including ordering, merchandising and managing inventory, marketing locally and directly hiring, training and employing their store workers. IOs initially contribute capital to establish their business and share store-level gross profits with us. These factors both align our interests and incentivize IOs to aggressively grow their business to realize substantial financial upside. This combination of local decision-making supported by our purchasing scale and corporate resources results in a “small business at scale” model that we believe is difficult for competitors to replicate. Our value proposition has broad appeal with bargain-minded customers across all income levels, demographics and geographies. Customers visited our stores over 85 million times in 2018 with the average customer shopping twice per month and spending over $25 per transaction. We believe that our sustained focus on delivering ever-changing “WOW!” deals within a fun, treasure hunt shopping environment has generated strong customer loyalty and brand affinity. This customer enthusiasm is evidenced by our high scores on surveys designed to measure customer experience of our brand and 11 consecutive years of positive comparable store traffic growth. We believe that our broad customer appeal supports significant new store growth opportunities, and we plan to continue to expand our reach to additional customers and geographies across the United States. Our stores have performed well across all economic cycles, as demonstrated by our 15 consecutive years of positive https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=1085482-89659"
Happy Birthday to my girl Tere!!!! Let's make this week count babygirl!!! Love you!!!! #GO RELIEF THERAPEUTICS!!!!!
I think GO does better when the market is down. Profitable since 1949. They know how to circumvent a downturn.
"Trying to pinpoint where, exactly to get into this. I doubt it goes under $100 but if it does, I'm going to pounce. I love these companies that plan on attacking the suburban and small town markets. $DASH $DG $GO are three great examples. Not every company can operate in these markets, but the ones that can will dominate in the future with the suburban revolution. I drive for DASH in my spare time. I hardly ever see an UberEats or GrubHub order in my market. DASH completely dominates."
Sell on Tuesday continue.

"We have 2 Grocery Outlets nearby and both are wildly popular. Been shopping them for over 20 years. Bought this stock because, forsaking some crazy unforeseen, this chain is going to roar on the east coast."

"Sector rotation and safe haven going to $KR and $GO as funds look for safety and market focus. UNFI isn't benefiting from any of this, as we were warned about CEO succession disarray and now the crippling results ( more than soft) of the current EXPO Food Show are very telling . August 1st marks the 4 year anniversary of the 'infamous 1 for 7 reverse stock split' of Supervalu which was key to the UNFI takeover. This concludes one of the most shady and villainous eras of the food distribution space in recent memory.

Either I'm impatient which is definitely true or this stock truly is a laggard. With all indexes up for almost a week now this stock has slowly traded downward. Amazing momentum upward but still no sign of good news for this stock. It formed a cup and now its handle and it's now dipping further which spells disaster. Disappointing in this stock and I advise anyone to stay away until the presidential debates/election. This stock is falling daily on no news and low volume just a pure laggard

All supermarkets- food stocks are up and currently most of them are GREEN. The GO stock is notparticipated in the food stocks rally and it is not far from 52 week low. It is so OVERSOLD and shouldbe rebounding very soon or at the market close today.The GO stock should be heading back between $28 to $29.50 near term so I am accumulating the undervaluedstock and taking advantage of the sell off to buy at this great deep discount prices....

If GO doesn't get some kind of a bounce soon One will be forced to think it not at bottom yet. Seems to be no urgency to create or add to position
Hooray! I'm losing money again!
GO Baby GO
$29 and some now. lol
Lol...GO reporting earnings today and no one has been on this board. I must be the only s/h left.
crooked
Only 26 M shares available? May be this is great for retail investors... It can go to 70s in no time...
Share dilution with this secondary offering.
Yesterday was a gift for those that did`nt buy the IPO. I added and wish I had picked up more. I love shopping at these stores.https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4653046
Is $50 possible?
"I was encouraged by how aggressively GO is paying down debt. The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2019 with $462.5 million in total debt, compared to $709.1 million at the end of the same period in 2018. Holding this stock for long term."
"#Slack is the best investment, for three simple reasons: It’s growing at a fast rate, it faces fewer direct competition, and its non-GAAP net losses are narrowing. + New AWS and VA deal, oh, 2nd Covid 19 out break is Loading... #work from home till 2021  #Go Slack !"
The CEO outplayed the shorts badly when he said $go alone with a wink$ #BodyLanguage
"Only shorters care about the price movement every single day. When stock went up, they disappeared. When stock dropped 1%，alex came back and said this was massive sell off. Yes. Massive with 100k volume lol"
"I need $250,000 to open one more of GO location."
I will short this when It hit $40-$43. And then buy again at $30-$35. Nice chat.
"Grocery Outlet has existed for more than seven decades and went public this June. Quarterly filings with the Security and Exchange Commission reveal that the brand is growing: net sales increased to $645.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $575.1 million in the same time last year.The company expects net sales of $2.53 billion in 2019, up from $2.5 billion last year, and a net growth of 29 stores nationwide."
Got 500 shares back today. Swing from 47. Pretty happy now. Thanks shorts

"The legend of ""Chuck"":Clint Eastwood has posters of ""Chuck"" in his man cave...#go ahead make my day"
"if you can't make profit as a discount grocery store during a pandemic when the restaurants are closed, you are run by completely incompetent management"
With all the restaurants and other business going out and unemployment. GO is the clear choice! Loading up today!
"We lived in CA, and we shopped at the go a lot, this stock is a winner"
Look at Lidl. They are growing fast. Deep discounting. GO looks compelling.
picked up more shares at $30.80. GO is going to have an epic quarter. Long.
Selling pressure will continue. Buying opportunity will come !
"CEO Lindberg sold 25,000 last month knowing they are going to miss this qtr."
Today I got in at $ 33.00
DJ-7 days ago Goldman Sachs raised the price target on GO to $43.00. At that time the stock was trading at $36.31. The secondary was $34.00 and the stock shot up to $38.00. Now you can buy the stock under the secondary below $33.00.
So CNBC talks up Slack (WORK) and they move up 8%. No talk much about Grocery Outlet and we get 35% gains. Look at the discount sector. All those stocks are high.
The Go Grocery in San Leandro is great. Go there at least once a week. A little out of my way but worth it.

Great report. The conference call will decide where it's going.

Hello all! Just bought a bit of this. Seems seriously underpriced... GLTA!
Great numbers. +$40 by end of week I hope!
That Cramer!!!!
Market up. What about GO?
"I call this a stealth stock. Very few follow it. Name is not familiar to most. If you live in the west coast you know who grocery outlet is. This is ground floor op like Costco. Dollar tree Aldies sells knock off items - not name brand. Best bargain mkt in Cali. I shop Trader Joe’s , Costco, amd grocery outlet. NOSH items are huge with younger folk. Kroger is a joke compared to this company. Buffetbought the wrong stock /Even billionaires can be out of the loop. He says he missed amazon. Enough said"
Nike did not provide guidance yet it is up AH knowing they will have a bad next report. GO does the same but knowing they will have a strong next report and it tanks. S M H
Almost time to buy more $
"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
Today was just heading toward first base for a Home run with Namaste. #Go Team Namaste
GO 's EPS earnings were matched with concensus but the markets was looking for more......and the GO stockwas sold off big time. Take advantage of today's sell and start accumulating GO share as it will come backat least 28.50 this week or earlier next week. It hit 52 week low and currently sitting in the oversold condition.I am a buyer of GO to take advantage of this deep discount and its oversold condition.......
Waiting for better entry.

Yesterday’s scenario?
Someone dumped after hours. Not good.
"Debt seems high in relation to the growth rate. Also, forward P/E is around 35... Other grocery companies have a forward P/E that is much lower... i.e, Sprouts = 15. Cramer seems to say ""good company, expensive stock"". Anyone concerned?"
"Got in yesterday under $31. I LOVE this company over the long term. Recession-proof and good for millenials who are short on cash. One of the few stores that can beat Wal Marts prices, out of Amazons industry, and offers a scavenger hunt model that brings customers to the store that has been used successfully by Five Below and Costco already."
