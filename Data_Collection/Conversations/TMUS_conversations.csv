"T-Mobile's statistical tie with Kuwait's STC for the joint global 5G availability title is in fact made that much more impressive by the US geography as the ""Un-carrier"" had to cover a considerably larger area than its East Asian rivals to reach a final score of 35.7 percent.For what it's worth, AT&T also earned an honorable mention as a 5G availability ""global leader"" (which is different from a ""global winner"", mind you), while Verizon, well, did not receive any such praise whatsoever."
Next Ex-Dividend Date ?Thank you
"Just bought some calls for $TMUS $118 strike, can't wait for earnings! Just made some solid gains with $MCD and $MA calls"
Market i up HUGE. What is the matter with TMUS. Is it broken ?
I had to buy life guard because of these guys
AAPL and TMUS share price have been neck and neck all year. Now TMUS is lower by $35! Will TMUS quickly catch up after earnings? That's alot of juice if so! Worth holding at least some thru earnings...will Sievert and team deliver??
Waiting for $110
"If you listened to the ""T"" conference call then one of the analysts said the investment community is concerned about earning from all of the wireless carriers due to the free phone offers. T-mobile screwed everyone by trying to gain subscribers with low pricing which forced ""T"" & ""VZ"" to match the offers. In the end TMUS loses since they have the worst service."
"Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, with 90% having a Buy or equivalent rating. Their average target price is $152.49, about 18% above the stock’s recent level of $129.25. Barron’s also recommended buying T-Mobile shares last January."

"===11/06/2020==$155 price target===> BofA analyst David Barden raised the price target to $155.00 (up from $130.00) and reiterated a “Buy” rating. “For the second quarter since the Sprint merger, T-Mobile posted results that were better across the board with net adds, service revenue, adj. EBITDA, and churn all better than expected. The company raised 2H20 guidance for adj. EBITDA ($6.5-6.6bn implied for 4Q) which looks conservative relative to the $7bn in 2Q and 3Q,” Barden said in a note to clients."
Down 22% from highs...share buybacks coming and earnings growth expected. Probably time to be buying more down here!
"Doesn't surprise me, T-Mobile asks for everything when opening an account with them. Name and address isn't enough. They need to know your birthdate, Driver's License, SSN, spouse's info also, among other things."
(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. surged the most in nine months after unveiling a deal to acquire 4.5% of Deutsche Telekom AG and sell part of its stake in T-Mobile US Inc. to the German telecommunications carrier.
"It would be great if I could make a phone call or check my e-mail on T-Mobile but all we get is No Service. Iphone 12 and Iphone 6S . We have the service were roam is included but it does not roam on Verizon or ATT only on Sprint, but Sprint is no longer allowing it to roam. Is anyone able to make calls on T-Mobile? Worked OK in the past but has not worked since the beginning of August. Tech said Sprint tower in Shelbyville Illinois no longer servicing T-Mobil so the whole city and area is out. (about 12000 people). Hope they get service back soon, it used to. be good."

BUY. RESN ! CHECK IT OUT!! RESN. 
"Why all the selling? I’m starting to think Mr Market is losing faith in the once high flying John Legere’s T-Mobile Un-Carrier strategy. The competition is slowly, but surely biting into T-Mobile’s market share. Now it makes perfect sense why the T-Mobile market cap collapsed upwards of $17 Billion in under 7 weeks."
"TMUS $135 target price, 5G will rock and the share will go like rocket"
"@sprint shareholders get .10256 of @TMobile in merger.Currently $TMUS is $78So $78 X .10256 = $8.00What $S shareholders will get.#Sprint now @ $5.22A Whopping 50% discount...Based on factual events of merger situation, doesn't seem correct..."
What’s wrong with this stock
It’s time to start paying dividends.
Wonder if it would have been different if Legere were still in charge…..T-Mobile CEO Apologizes for Data-Security BreachCarrier says it failed to protect customer data and has hired security experts to beef up defenses.
Down $35 from the $150 top...thats nearly 25% down...time to really think about buying more down here. Earnings are next week...hopefully a nice beat coming!
TMUS is the fastest growing and has the best frequency that no other competitor can compete
"People on the AT&T Board are worried that AT&T is trending much like GE did... dropping in price, cutting dividends only to further drop in price, sell assets... cut more dividends until it went from 90 dollars to 10 dollars then did a reverse split with a very small dividend...!"
This melt down is beyond comprehension.TMUS is by far the strongest 5G leader in the US. This one incident of hacking causing melt down is not reasonable
"this seems to be the best of breed amongst the telcos. however, I have T-Mobile phone and 5 g is not much faster than 4g... any thought?"
"T-Mobile is past its growth stock prime. Cramer and Company are trying, but the pump isn’t working because it’s done. They’ll be moving on to a new pump. Better move on, too."
Bought some more just under $117...will keep dry powder in case we go lower. TMUS is the BEST regardless!
Still holding a small position...sold most of my original holdings at $140. Will buy back when the time is right. Love this company and stock!
"Congratulation on T-Mobile and Sprint...At the core of the 5G arms race is the issue of spectrum ownership. Sprint's 2.5 GHz spectrum and T-Mobile's strong balance sheet would enable the merged carrier to roll out 5G on mid-band frequencies and be two to three years ahead of Verizon/AT&T.When combined, T-Mobile/Sprint would own more radio spectrum than AT&T or Verizon, an important edge as 5G wireless services are rolled out. T-Mobile will finally have the deep block of 2.5 GHz midband spectrum they always coveted. That will allow the new T-Mobile to mount the most credible threat either Verizon's or AT&T's network supremacy has ever faced.The old T-Mobile was a pure growth and stock buyback story while the new T-Mobile story is going to be a merger integration and synergy extraction story, not that it won't ever return to the old growth story.T-Mobile and Sprint predict some $6 billion in back-office cost savings would result from combining billing operations and information technology departments. The companies also plan to combine wireless networks, cellphone towers and retail locations.T- Mobile US and Sprint had agreed on new merger terms and were looking to close the deal as early as April 1, 2020. Under the revised deal, T- Mobile's parent Deutsche Telekom will hold about 43% of the combined entity, up from the 42% that the German group would have held. SoftBank will hold about 24% and the rest by public shareholders.SoftBank has agreed to surrender about 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the 'new company' after the deal closes, changing the exchange ratio to 11 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, higher than the originally agreed 9.75 shares. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original fixed exchange ratio."
Likely tmus will announce buyback end of 2022. A 30 billions (depends on then share price) equals to 10 to 20 percent of outstanding shares but 25 to 40 percent of floats because Deutsch telecom and other insiders already hold 60 percent of outstanding shares. This buyback of 20 to 40 percent of floats will push tmus thru the roof.
Buying Opportunity.
"Broke under $116, what’s it going down to after Sleepy Joe tanks the market in the coming sell off/correction ?"
"So if Verizon is losing wireless customers, where do you think those customers are going? If they are like me they are going to TMobile."
"Sprint and T-Mobile say this deal is necessary for America to have a nationwide 5G network. But their own words prove them wrong.Myth: Neither company can launch a 5G network on its own.Fact: Before they announced a merger, both companies aggressively touted their ability and plans to launch a 5G network. T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in 2017 that his company would “leapfrog” Verizon and AT&T and be first to “real, mobile, nationwide 5G” by 2020. And Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in February 2018 that the carrier would launch a nationwide 5G network in 2019.Myth: The United States needs this deal to secure a 5G network and maintain its leadership in 5G.Fact: AT&T and Verizon are both building out and launching their own 5G networks. Verizon has already launched 5G in several markets and AT&T plans to offer mobile 5G in 12 cities by the end of 2018.Myth: This deal would let the two companies invest more in their 5G.Fact: According to their statements to Wall Street, the two companies were already planning to spend on 5G roughly the same amount that they told the FCC they would spend if they were allowed to combine. 2019 All rights reserved. 4Competition CoalitionContact Privacy Policy"

"The bear market impacts interest rates to move lower. This sharp and deep of a downturn is sharper than past recessions and was quickly countered by the coordinated efforts of world banks to provide extraordinary funding to patch up the holes to keep the international economy afloat. What will be the overall impacts? Will the downturn harm New T-Mobile more than competitors? Does it lead to drying up of the bond market funding? Or will the expectation for gaining market share in a stirred up market mean New T-Mobile will look less risky, thus resulting in lower interest rates for debt and higher stocks prices? There are both positive and negative impacts of recessions - the winners and losers. Some companies and more efficient was to deliver goods and services gain on competitors as consumers become frugal and seek more fulfilling alternatives. The turmoil can shake up the market psychology because it derails the comfort implied by sticking with the current purchase habits. Stock markets often retreat towards safety during recessions. However, when the turmoil brings the consensus opinions about the direction of the economy and markets, that can cause a reshuffling of market priorities that favors growth. Growth in topline sales and profits is the golden rule of market logic - if a company can grow relative to competitors and the broad market, that dispels fears in a blanket fashion. New T-Mobile is in a good position relative to competitors in the MVNO/ICT field. The coronavirus shakes up fundamental understands of how reliable (risk vs reward) and stable business and investing will go forward. I have more questions than answers on this. That’s a starting point."
"Headed below 100. Hard to say where the bottom will be. 80 or 70 or even 60...who knows!! Staying short for now, looks like a death chart. Most likely some really bad news is leaking to the chosen ones and they’re shorting this like no tomorrow!!! Cya below 100 shortly. Cheers!"
"Masa Son sold his huge stake to DT for approx. $103 per share shortly after the merger. If that is the price both major parties were satisfied with, it would be safe to bet around $100 is the max pain we will see. Although really, we're not that far from there now!"
Len is still waiting for his $50 entry.......and Moffet is probably still waiting for $2 
"Zacks is whacko. The recent article points out a high volume of AUG puts. Puts are a form of insurance that seldom make any sense for small investors IMO. Who buys puts? Institutions and high work laggards. It is a lazy way to seek peace and have job security against screwing things up royally. Small investors do not have the problem of back-stopping large blocks of shares and should be placing stop-loss orders against a collapse in prices. There are options strategies that use puts as part of it that can make sense but few small investors use them. If markets become extremely oversold similar to many tech stocks during the Internet bubble collapse, writing/opening of put positions can make sense. However, that has a huge risk so is not recommended for all but the most skilled hedge fund and professionals. I know of people who did very well during previous downturns only to find themselves forced to liquidate put positions because the market continued to deline. That forced closing of position changed large paper gains into nearly total losses of those positions.Anyway, Zacks, once again, failed to provide the context/logic. Merely pointing out that there is a large number of puts or calls traded is like lighting a match in a oil distillery."
They’ll most likely recover. It’s not the first tech company this has happened to.
"LOL,LOL told you TMUS and their EU one world order was going to cause customers to leave in droves once they found out TMUS was a foreign company with a Foreign agenda with their EU one world order to destroy America and use your data against you How do you think the DEM wit far left are getting information on people from people working at VZ and TMUS. Only Safe place for your data is T now"
TMUS though is the best among the telcos if thats any consolation & will rebound the quickest.. T is #$%$..
"After auction 110 is completed, there will be no more expensive mid band auction in the near future. All 3 carriers can start using their free cash flow to reduce debt, buy back shares or increase dividends. So as a group investors will be more optimistic. However among those 3, T-Mobile is the most favorable next comes Verizon. Att position is precarious because it will have the least amount of midband."
This German owned company doesn’t want to pay a dividend .
It is time for TMUS to start paying a dividend. A company this large in this industry with this stock performance over the past 12 months had better get straightened out quickly and paying a dividend would be a very good start.
Sell. TMUS is losing it compatible advantage.
For a company that's in the business of communicating... This ceo doesn't seem to know how...!
"===8/10/2020==$215 price target===> “Better 2020 results; bigger and faster long-term synergies; share gains likely to take off as the company starts to push its network advantage more aggressively in 4Q,” New Street analyst Jonathan Chaplin wrote. “Seems good to us. We will no doubt be nudging up estimates.”Chaplin has a street-high target of $215 on T-Mobile, which he rates at Buy."
Mike Sievert should fulky understand current position that TMUS is in.They have the best spectrum that can cover entire nation to support autonomous vehicle technology. They can partner with TSLA and many other car makers

Ok clue me in.I just read two articles one being they could close this merger around April 1st other that is still needs California utilities approval that could be into July or later any ideas here about that?
"A good earnings surprise can pop this thing back to $130 fast....assuming no broad market correction occurs. From $150 down to $117 is a big 22% drop already, and RSI is still around 30 in oversold territory.

"When you are the number 1 Telecommunications Company in the USA, Those enemies like AT&T, or Verizon sell the wolves after you if your slip a little. I would be surprised if we find AT&T and Verizon teaming up to fund these lawsuits, not to win but to scratch TMOBILE's image Create a sentiment that they are crashing and the 5G service is bad.The real deal is that they are getting hammered by TMO on all fronts. T crying to FCC they TMO has to much power. Ignoring that for years they spend billions dominating 4g and overleveraging itself to stay on top. But when the technology changed, they could not complete, they put to much equity in old technology. For year they lied to there customers by implying 4GE was 5G. TMO exposed that lie and now they are losing the real 5G battle.TMO is still extremely over valued. One of the best short and long term investments in the market."
"Sadly identify theft is big business. Any company that stores your personal info is going to be a Target.

Its happened before, and its going to happen again, and there will be no shortage of gaslighting sensationalist Karen and Chad's, acting like its the end is nigh, and that when it does happen to a company, its the only company that its ever happened to. TMUS had been lucky for the most part, but this should be a wake up call that they're a prime target now that their number of customers has grown exponentially in the last few years."
"T-Mobile will need to start making money and yes, budgeting dividends as well (and protect their precious customers and accounts much better from hackers) so it is not realistic that its current strategy can continue for much longer. I will stay with Verizon. T has made way too many costly mistakes and has a lot yet to prove before I put any money into that bird too."
absurdly undervalued
"On Monday, Bank of America analyst David Barden resumed coverage on T-Mobile stock with a “buy” recommendation and a target price of $110. According to a report from TheFly, “The analyst says his assumed 8-times expected forwarded EBITDA premium relative to AT&T and Verizon is appropriate given the company’s potential to exceed those firms in growth due to potential synergy realization upside and network capability.”"
"FCC Needs To Investigate T-Mobile...as former Sprint customers (20 years) we have been forced by T-Mobile to spend over $500 to fund their takeover of Sprint...first off my phone was deactivated...

We're climbing back

"One interesting tidbit from Nokia's 20-F is that they used an EUR to USD exchange rate of 1 EUR = $1.1422. As an example, they reported 21.852B EUR in revenue and converted to USD as $24.959B. Today the EUR to USD exchange rate is 1 EUR = $1.1918 which would translate from 21.852B EUR to $26.043B. (A $1.084B increase)The EUR to USD exchange rate is fast approaching a 5 year high of 1 EUR = $1.2555 and based on all the Gov't spending in the US, it's likely that the value of the dollar will continue to fall. With that being said, the 21.852B EUR in 2020 revenue would translate to $27.435B ( A $2.476B increase) assuming flat revenue in 2021. I don't expect flat revenue in 2021 and the news about $TMUS only increases my optimism.My advice: Start watching the EUR to USD exchange rates and it's impact on Nokia Financials."
"TMUS stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock during the prior 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.TMUS stock has retreated from a high of 150.20 set on July 16.As of Oct. 12, T-Mobile stock trades well below an entry point. It needs to form a new base to be actionable.Most technical ratings could be better. TMUS stock is not a buy."

"What does this mean for the T-Mobile retail shareholders? Under the swap agreement, Deutsche Telekom plans to exercise call options granted under a 2020 deal to acquire about 45 million T-Mobile shares, issuing 225 million new shares to SoftBank in exchange, Tokyo-based SoftBank said in a statement on Tuesday. The German company will then acquire additional T-Mobile stock after it completes the sale of the Netherlands unit.At the end of the transactions, SoftBank will end up with 4.5% of Deutsche Telekom and about a 3.3% slice of T-Mobile, which could rise to 6.9% contingent on the U.S. carrier hitting certain milestones. Last year, Son unloaded part of its holdings in T-Mobile in a $21 billion deal that helped pay for a record buyback of SoftBank’s own shares. The Japanese company has also pledged $13.3 billion of T-Mobile shares for a $4.38 billion margin loan. SoftBank said in the statement it will be able to use Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile shares as collateral for “financing and hedging purposes.”"

"Shenandoah Telecommunications, aka Shentel, has revealed that it’s in negotiations with T-Mobile to continue on as an affiliate of T-Mo post-merger. Shentel has been operating as an affiliate of Sprint since 1995 and has more than 1 million wireless customers in states like Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.In a filing with the SEC, Shentel explains that its affiliate agreement gives its 90 days to negotiate with T-Mobile about staying on as an affiliate. If no agreement is reached between the two, then T-Mobile will have 60 days to decide if it wants to purchase the assets of Shentel’s wireless business for 90% of its entire business value.If T-Mobile does not purchase Shentel’s wireless business, then Shentel will have 60 days to buy the legacy T-Mobile network and subscribers in its service area. And finally, if Shentel does not buy those assets, T-Mobile must sell or decommission its legacy network and customers in Shentel’s service area.Neither T-Mobile nor Shentel have given any official indication about the negotiations or what they expect to happen. Analysts at Raymond James speculate that T-Mobile may want to work through the process quickly, while analysts at B. Riley FBR feel that T-Mobile is likely to buy Shentel’s wireless business"
TMUS looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
Use the money to buy back shares first...then a dividend once less outstanding shares and huge EPS!

TMUS customers will be moving to VZ in droves. So will their shareholders. Get on the VZ bandwagon now and make some big coin!!!
Earnings should be good just had bad news so still looking at around 130-35 after earnings based on my analysis
Wow I used to have Sprint in Shelbyville Illinois with good service. I switched to T-Mobile to find out there IS NO SERVICE there. At first they used Sprint tower and it may have used roaming. Now it no longer roams. Tried to get it fixed with NADA results. Now must drive 8 miles to make a phone call. BE careful T-Mobile Investors and customers. T-Mobile sucks. They won't let me switch back to Sprint (it still works there). This is not a small town. They even sell T-Mobile at the Walmart there but it does not work in this city.
"Ok, folks. Below is what $T reported for Q3. Did Seivert read this and immediately start the $1,000 iPhone promo knowing Tmus won’t come close to these numbers when they report on 11-2-21? ￼Me thinks so. I hope I’m wrong but the coincidence is alarming. Be prepared for more selling if Mr Market agrees with me…,Excerpt from T earnings. Mobility: 928,000 postpaid phone net adds; 1,218,000 postpaid net adds; 249,000 prepaid phone net adds; Postpaid phone churn of 0.72%."
Something to ponder: Deutsch telecom just exercised its option to buy 65 million shares from SoftBank. Obviously if there is a fallout from recent hack that will negatively affect Tmus business Deutsch telecoms would not go thru this transaction. They must think the recent drop represent a opportunistic time to increase their Tmus holdings.
"Let me just share how profitable the Sprint business is within TMobile umbrella:- Interest Payment - $2.6B before and less than $1.3B now- Churn - most of the Sprint customers churned to Tmobile - 1.8% before - less than 1% now this translates to more the a $1BSo just with this merger the Sprint business goes from break even to $2.3B +ve per year. Now kick-in the synergies around network, marketing, spectrum and new business opportunities. This will be $150 stock in less than two year...."
Down $33. dollars from their high and no dividend. OUCH!
"Now it all boils down to EXECUTION. I’m still not convinced Mike Seivert is the right guy for the CEO’s job. Prove me wrong….T-Mobile US, Inc.

"Like $NOK overall, I believe the 5G FastMile FWA Router announcement with $TMUS is being completely underestimated and the fact that NOK leads in this market globally with other carriers such as Swisscom, Optus, Zain, and others further validates that NOK will see significant growth in 2021.TMUS's strategy is genius as they are not marketing to replace your cable provider at home, but provide a separate secure Office Internet connection. Cable providers bundle Internet with T.V., security, and mobile devices so making a switch isn't easy, but adding an Office Internet connection as part of an onboarding of new employees is much easier and cleaner than implementing an expense or stipend program. (Especially for Fed, State, and Local Gov't Employees as Tax issues arise due to the need to separate out personal vs. business use)This is being underestimated and, with all the FWA contracts NOK has signed, I expect this will bring in NEW revenue of $2B to $4B in 2021 globally and more than offset the business lost with VZ.NOK will see $8 to $10 per share once this is realized unless they are acquired first."
"The most recent drop was similar to the current one in the chart and it took 2-3 months to recover. Even if the share price recovers, time would be wasted not making money with my money. Thanks TMUS. For a high tech company, you need to spend money to beef up against hacking."

Mike Sievert is really hurting the company big time. He needs to go
Down 10 days in a row. That's actually impressive even though I'm losing money. LOL
Another T-Mobile sell off on twice the daily average volume and no news…..something going on behind the curtain and it isn’t favorable to retail shareholders.
Mike Seivert. What the #$%$ is happening with T-Mobile? In 7 weeks T-Mobile collapsed from a high of $149.34 to yesterday?s close of $136.00 losing a monster $16.57 Billion in market cap value. T-Mobile?s security breach has launched customer uncertainty as class action lawsuits pile up. Haven?t you learned anything from John Legere? Step up Mike or get the hell out of the way and bring in someone like Legere as CEO.

Members of the Committee, that is not in the public interest.""President Shelton's testimony also captured why the testimony and related jobs, consumer, and rural pledges of T-Mobile CEO and President John Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure should be viewed with a skeptical eye: ""Without binding and enforceable commitments – and I mean commitments that have no loopholes – such promises are just cheap sales talk and are easily broken. ...Trusting Sprint and T-Mobile with American jobs is like trusting a vampire at a blood bank. These are two of the worst companies in the United States when it comes to labor law and the treatment of workers. In recent years, T-Mobile has been charged with more labor law violations per worker than even Walmart.""Shelton highlighted T-Mobile's track record of buying companies and then cutting jobs, noting the aftermath and harm of T-Mobile's 2018 acquisition of Iowa Wireless (the subject of a CWA report, Disrupting Rural Wireless, released this week). As Shelton noted, ""After it acquired Iowa Wireless in 2018, it closed all iWireless call centers and more than 90 percent of its retail locations. It closed every single store in rural Iowa.""In his opening remarks, Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) noted, ""As part of [the Committee's] oversight responsibility, we must make sure that the FCC is carefully reviewing the facts and keeping consumers' best interests in mind when deciding the fate of the merger.""Members of Congress expressed skepticism about the companies' claims during the hearing, pressing T-Mobile CEO John Legere and Sprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure on jobs, consumer prices, rural buildout, and their commitment to the federal lifeline program that helps low-income consumers access critical telecommunications services.As Subcommittee Chairman Mike Doyle (D-Penn.), said in his opening statement, ""I've seen a lot of mergers in this industry and others, and it's hard to think of one where consolidation didn't result in people losing their jobs, prices going up, and innovation being stifled.""Read a copy of CWA President Chris Shelton's written testimony to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology of the Energy and Commerce CommitteeRead CWA's detailed economic analysis on why the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint merger would eliminate 30,000 jobs (find a state-by-state breakdown of projected retail job loss here)Read the February 2019 CWA report, Disrupting Rural Wireless, explaining why T-Mobile's 2018 acquisition of Iowa Wireless (""iWireless"") undercuts the claim that the T-Mobile/Sprint merger would benefit rural America and the small businesses that serve as authorized dealers for T-Mobile and Sprint servicesRead the December 2018 report, Labor Market Impact of the Proposed Sprint–T-Mobile Merger, by the Economic Policy Institute and the Roosevelt Institute, which found that reducing the number of wireless carriers from four to three would reduce retail wireless workers' wages by up to $3,276 per year."

"Will T-Mobile retail shareholders who hung in be rewarded in the next weeks/months? (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. equity capital market is wrapping up its biggest week in more than a year, with corporate issuers and their shareholders taking advantage of unabated demand for stocks to offer more than $20 billion of shares.A selling spree in shares of firms including State Street Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and VICI Properties Inc. came by way of two dozen secondary offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deals also included a $6.3 billion transaction by e-commerce and digital finance company Sea Ltd., the largest stock offering of the year.With earnings season and a traditional vacation period in the U.S. equity capital markets both out of the way, companies and private-equity holders have started to turn their focus toward potential changes in tax policy that could make it more expensive to sell shares later.“It’s somewhat dependent on what ultimately gets passed in the spending bill,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Gina Martin Adams said in an interview. “The potential for a simple increase in the corporate tax rate may also incentivize some companies to perform around that.” But"

"Looks like DT and SoftBank are the winners here. Not one mention of the TMUS shareholders. It increases the number of DT-owned T-Mobile shares by 65 million, up from 539 million today to 604 million, according to New Street Research.RELATED: DT rumored to want majority control of T-Mobile USMost of the deal shares (45 million) come from the swap with SoftBank, while 20 million are being acquired from the Japanese conglomerate with cash – about $2.4 billion – from DT’s sale of T-Mobile Netherlands to private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Apax.New Street said DT’s more than 48% share could get diluted back down if T-Mobile’s stock reaches above $150 per share and Softbank exercises certain options. “DT though still has options over a further 56m TMUS shares (7m fixed price at $101, 29m floating price option from Softbank and the remaining 20m call option from a financial institution),” wrote New Street’s James Ratzer. “This would equate to a 4.3% diluted stake, which would still [give] them the ability to guarantee a majority stake in TMUS.”"
Cramer had been preaching to wait for at least 30% pullback on high growth stocks that will be sensitive to rising 10 yr yield...I'm thinking at $100 is when this looks real juicy again.
Wells Fargo changed their price target from 170 to 160 and rated as Overweight yesterday. 38% upside. I'm in today.
Where is the bottom? 100?!
"Solid Q2 results, profits in long uptrend and big discount relative on their major $TMUS ownership."
"Will break 100 to the downside after the er then the panic selling will begin...60-70 coming in the next 6-12 months. Great short here still as momentum is dead, valuation is not that cheap and there are zero catalysts to move this up...will be a disaster for long holders for the next 2-5 years here...this is all clear as day! Cheers!"
"The pullback is just sector revaluation based on higher rates and reopening trade being back on. Tech and Telecom really benefitted from the pandemic but since vaccines are opening the world back up, its not the sector for Hot Money to be in right now. Once we bottom, the money will find its way back into these stocks when the value becomes obvious."
T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) reported quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.53 by 47.17 percent.

T-Mobile has been a legitimate competitor against AT&T and Verizon for quite awhile.. Taking market share quarter after quarter. Now just T-Mobile gets hacked?
The company is committed to return $60B to it's shareholders between 2023 and 2026. After that at least 18B a year. Which other company with Market cap of less than 150B committed to provide such returns? None. This is a long term gem that will pay more than 12.5% in cash return per year. Do the math...

"This is my favorite company in my portfolio. In addition to the merger gain, T-Mobile is going to revolutionize the wireless industry in the next decade. Their massive investment in 5G will allow for new technology, and really a new way of life that we can only dream of."
Well well. I wonder if the fact T-Mobile is 100% foreigner owned will be brought into the limelight?
"Why T-Mobile does not depend on John Legere or any CEO to develop success and why John may stay at New T-Mobile:T-Mobile is a story about leveraging of the key ingredients that make wireless a success. At its roots, mainstream wireless business depends on the efficient use of capital to acquire spectrum and build cost-efficient and capable multiple-service networks. These networks are based on industry standards somewhat arbitrarily segmented into generations that started with 1G during a period when there were multiple competing technologies along both proprietary and standardized design paths. With each successive generation the advantages of adopting the most common industry standard grew: ease of roaming on other operators networks, lower cost and more capable equipment and more common devices among them. That caused operators to migrate towards the 3GPP standards, which authored 4G-LTE, 4G-Advanced (2nd gen. of 4G that works better with 5G), and 5G. Along the way operators using other standards or proprietary network technologies such as Sprint-Nextel iDen had to move users to new devices that worked on other bands so they could repurpose the spectrum to the 3GPP standards.T-Mobile has migrated to the common standards without losing subscribers similar to Sprint because they acquired fresh spectrum the company used to deploy the latest gen technology. Sprint had more problems and still faces a shortage of easy to use, wide coverage spectrum.The T-Mobile+Sprint merger sets the company up to exploit a mix of spectrum to deploy the latest, more efficient 4G-A+5G capable network. The advantage of using multiple bands with the newest network tech includes connecting to customers based on their needs or what's called ‘best connected’ use of spectrum. If customer use is a vending machine that communicates low bandwidth on periodic bases, it may best use narrow-band guard-channel that would otherwise go unused. If the user is a household containing multiple video uses, it may best connect using Sprint’s 2.5 GHz connected through a 5G home router. The advantage is being able to fit the network to the market rather than horn shoe customers to fit the network. That works out to be a better experience for customers and a better return on capital investment.Why that may incline John Legere to stick around to see the situation flower:NewTM will have roots-up network advantage over its competitors. That is why it can plan to offer lower prices and higher broadband packages while including more bells and whistles such as multiple number calling, Netflix on Us, and growing data rather than escalating prices (indicative of AT&T, Comcast). This will be an exciting time to be the ‘salesman in chief’ of New T-Mobile.On the other side the picture, taking over the CEO spot at WeWonk will be fraught with fundamental problems. The business plan is not unique and is oversold, over leveraged, and highly competitive at a time when the US economy will like come into a headwind. Competitors that have been managed more conservatively are enjoying WeWonk’s problems by grabbing market share. Meanwhile, WeWonk does not disclose numbers on site revenues or aged revenue, which makes comparisons to competitors difficult. The gross losses, however, are startling. If Legere were to take the CEO spot, he would face a much different role. Being a flamboyant spokesperson just won’t cut it until years of probably very painful restructuring take place. That will make WeWonk look like another basket-case Sprint with the prospect of needing to trim costs aggressively. WeWonk will probably see shrinkage… like the Seinfeld episode... “I just got out of the pool!” will be an embarrasing proposition for the front man. The more I think about it, the less likely it looks that John Legere will want to leave the company is about to take on AT&T and Verizon more directly and across the board."
"""Jim Cramer maintained that T-Mobile is still his favorite telecommunications stock..."" If the data breach doesn't scare you, that should!"

"T-Mobile prepared to pay a hefty ransom…Aug 16 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc on Monday acknowledged a data breach but said it was yet to find if any customer information has been compromised, a day after an online forum alleged that personal data of more than 100 million of its users was leaked.The telecom operator said in a blogpost https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/cybersecurity-incident-update-august-2021 that it was confident the entry point used to access the data had been closed. It did not confirm the number of affected records.""We are conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement,"" the company said."
"AT&T and Verizon are in deep #$%$ They're falling behind in 5G and debt is piling up. Cannot keep up or compete with TMobile 5G. Look for drastic cuts to 5G investment. Very difficult to raise capital when you are overleveraged. They may need to team up against TMO are face major roadblocks. This is why they fought so hard to prevent the Sprint merger. They were dragging there feet on 5g, At&t for years fooling there customers with 5E, a 4g service packaging it as real 5G.It's going to be interesting the next few months."
"I advised a few to invest into Sprint a week prior to the judges decision on the approval. They failed to take my advice, and I occasionally remind them of my $10,000 unrealized gain. My hopes is that everyone is doing well with this position. The future, in the present, looks very strong. Happy investing! "

Mr Market is ready to take this down below the current 52 week low on the premise TMUS has lost it’s Legere Uncarrier competitive explosive growth edge…,unless a miracle happens, look for TMUS to trade just above $100 in the following days after the 11-2-21 earnings news….."

Sounds like a job for FEYE or ZS. Long on both them and their future is very good because of days like today with T Mobile. FEYE better play at this time as ZS is a bit overvalued today.

"The court ruling hinges on a weighing of the merits of the merger as based in the laws as they have become practiced. The merger started out without DISH or any other side deal being considered. However, the US Justice Department Antitrust Division, DoJ AR, headed by Makan Delrahim, had said from the beginning that DoJ needed there to be structural rather than remedial fixes in order to overcome the legal hurdles. That does make the DISH deal a critical component of the overall deal because that is the most 'structural' of the proposed merger changes. That might have been Comcast, Charter, a group of cable companies or the DISH deal may have been constructed differently. Perhaps as the rumors suggested, Amazon or Google might have taken part in the deal. I and apparently DoJ and nT-Mobile did not see that as viable as it never went into the discussions according to the records submitted to the regulators and court.DISH is pivotal but it cannot stand outside of the rest of the deal and the supporting evidence. That is because New T-Mobile will be very instrumental in helping DISH stand up a mobile-broadband business. The first few years of DiSH's effort won't be remotely feasible if not for the lucrative access to nT-Mobile's new network, conversion of base stations, conversion of MVNO customers, etc.Therefore, Judge Marrero must weigh all of the evidence: He must consider how well nTMUS can live up to its own plans to expand service and provide low prices. He has to look at how well the competitve MVNOs will be supported under the set of agreements. Marrero must weight how much local populations will be impacted by the removal of Sprint and shift of Boost+Virgin to DISH. And then, but only if those things hold up, he must look at DISH's plans as the speculative '4th nationwide mobile operator'. The merger started out with the simpler proposition of combining T-Mobile and Sprint and then progressively layered on commitments to hold pricing low, provide long-term access under favorable terms to competing MVNOs, provide rural coverage commitments. It was not until the last quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 did the DISH agreement start to percolate up as the fix needed for the structure of the US industry that would meet legal challenges. Why would it meet legal challenges? Because of those moutains of data backed by prior experiences of T-Mobile, Sprint and the fact of DISH having the largest portfolio of low-mid band spectra... more availble to roll out 5G than AT&T, Verizon and Sprint combined. While DISH is a pivotal focus of the merger, it is only feasible when all that came before it adds up. The FCC wanted to approve the merger without DISH. The DoJ wanted a more fundamental shake up of the mobile-media-boradband space. They got that extremely extraordinary measure and that clearly meets the legal requirements.The laws saw that companies are free to merge so long as they do not cause harm to the economy/public. They do not say that there won't be some harm done to some people in some places. There is no law that says companies must not make changes if it upsets some competitors and some unions or some politicians or some investment accounts.The merger has 99.9% (up from 99.5%) chance of being approved IMO."

They have 1 hour and 15 mins to think about going somewhere else. This is a short."

Buffet holds this and he would have alot to say about recent price action - be patient
"Matt Wagner, has a new target price of $175 per share."
"Keep your powder dry.“In a quarter when Verizon sacrificed growth for profitability, and AT&T sacrificed profit growth for customer growth, only T-Mobile delivered customer growth and profitability growth, beating consensus on both,” Sievert said. “We’re about to take all of their customers.”T-Mobile sees the good times continuing in 2021, as the cost savings and economies of scale from its acquisition of Sprint kick in. The company has already achieved $1.3 billion in annual cost savings since the combination closed in April. CFO Peter Osvaldik said on Thursday that T-Mobile expects to see $2.7 billion to $3 billion in annual synergies in 2021. That includes savings from combining networks, brand and marketing budgets, and reduced administrative and back-office costs."
