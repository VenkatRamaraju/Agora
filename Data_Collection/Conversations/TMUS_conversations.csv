It is time for TMUS to start paying a dividend. A company this large in this industry with this stock performance over the past 12 months had better get straightened out quickly and paying a dividend would be a very good start.
"TMUS stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock during the prior 13 weeks of trading. The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures institutional buying and selling in a stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of a C grade as neutral.TMUS stock has retreated from a high of 150.20 set on July 16.As of Oct. 12, T-Mobile stock trades well below an entry point. It needs to form a new base to be actionable.Most technical ratings could be better. TMUS stock is not a buy."
"wait for the disclsoures by funds. Big money taking profit. Don't be surprised if Warren Buffet is selling his positions. Future, although, for T mobile is bright. No need to sell."
"I got in at 120 & yes this is going down even more for sure ,, unbelievable. next support is 104.."
Mike Sievert should fulky understand current position that TMUS is in.They have the best spectrum that can cover entire nation to support autonomous vehicle technology. They can partner with TSLA and many other car makers
"Will break 100 to the downside after the er then the panic selling will begin...60-70 coming in the next 6-12 months. Great short here still as momentum is dead, valuation is not that cheap and there are zero catalysts to move this up...will be a disaster for long holders for the next 2-5 years here...this is all clear as day! Cheers!"
TMUS got a little ahead of itself. $150/ share? Ha. And here comes the crash with reality
Last day of tax selling by Institutions is today. BIG bounce next week??
Down 22% from highs...share buybacks coming and earnings growth expected. Probably time to be buying more down here!
Down $35 from the $150 top...thats nearly 25% down...time to really think about buying more down here. Earnings are next week...hopefully a nice beat coming!
Bought some more just under $117...will keep dry powder in case we go lower. TMUS is the BEST regardless!
Stay calm before the storm. Earnings will be an epic blowout. This stock will move 8-10% in two days.
"AFTER market closes….Not a positive sign…..new 52 week low coming? Bellevue, Washington — Mike Sievert, president & chief executive officer, and Peter Osvaldik, executive vice president & chief financial officer of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) look forward to discussing third quarter 2021 financial and operational results on Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)."
"The market now has all the earnings data on T and VZ. They’ve crunched the numbers and know TMUS must report unbelievably good numbers to bring about a rally in the stock. No pre-earnings announcement by Mike Seivert either. TMUS down another.75% again today. Mr Market is ready to take this down below the current 52 week low on the premise TMUS has lost it’s Legere Uncarrier competitive explosive growth edge…,unless a miracle happens, look for TMUS to trade just above $100 in the following days after the 11-2-21 earnings news….."
"Ok, folks. Below is what $T reported for Q3. Did Seivert read this and immediately start the $1,000 iPhone promo knowing Tmus won’t come close to these numbers when they report on 11-2-21? ￼Me thinks so. I hope I’m wrong but the coincidence is alarming. Be prepared for more selling if Mr Market agrees with me…,Excerpt from T earnings. Mobility: 928,000 postpaid phone net adds; 1,218,000 postpaid net adds; 249,000 prepaid phone net adds; Postpaid phone churn of 0.72%."
Hmm even the #$%$ red stocks from earlier today are going green now. This keeps going lower.You would think the Bestbuy/Walmart news would have at least made this perform with the market today and not under perform.
"Just saw this, published earlier today. Smells of desperation? Market thinks so. Tmus closes down 4%. “What’s the news: Now, T-Mobile will pay off what you owe the Carriers for your smartphone up to $1,000 when you switch.”"
Cramer had been preaching to wait for at least 30% pullback on high growth stocks that will be sensitive to rising 10 yr yield...I'm thinking at $100 is when this looks real juicy again.
"After auction 110 is completed, there will be no more expensive mid band auction in the near future. All 3 carriers can start using their free cash flow to reduce debt, buy back shares or increase dividends. So as a group investors will be more optimistic. However among those 3, T-Mobile is the most favorable next comes Verizon. Att position is precarious because it will have the least amount of midband."
"T and VZ performance this past week, which includes both companies earnings data. T -82%VZ +1.26% T-Mobile reports earnings on 11-2-21. Unless Mike Sievert has mega explosive data to report or block buster merger news comes out or announce share buybacks much sooner than expected Tmus could test a new 52 week low going into the holiday season….John Legere, you really knew how to run this company."
"Welp, it doesn’t seem that shorty is causing all this selling pain….T-Seivert down (again) for the last 5 trading days by minus 1.57%. Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)3.0Short Percent of Float2.60 %Short % Increase / Decrease-4 %Short Interest (Current Shares Short)15,390,000Shares Float591,560,000Short Interest (Prior Shares Short)16,050,000"
Remembering that AT&T and VZ have already reported earnings here is how they preformed this past 5 trading days. AT&T minus 0.90%VZ plus 0.11% Oh and T-Sievert minus 1.57% John Legere. You were a one and only. Hope your doing well in retirement….
"A good earnings surprise can pop this thing back to $130 fast....assuming no broad market correction occurs. From $150 down to $117 is a big 22% drop already, and RSI is still around 30 in oversold territory. Look at Apple...floundered down to $120 area for awhile then BAM back to $150 just like that on iPhone 13 launch. Keep an eye on this one!"
What is happening to T-Mobile
Basically all autonomous vehicles will require good RF signal. TMUS has the best position for this service
Earnings should be good just had bad news so still looking at around 130-35 after earnings based on my analysis
It looks like investors do not like recent promotions price war started by att with iPhones. I wonder how long att can absorb that promotion.
"Guy Adami, target price of $175 per share.as stated on Fast Money!"
"Now it all boils down to EXECUTION. I’m still not convinced Mike Seivert is the right guy for the CEO’s job. Prove me wrong….T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is ranked seventh on our list of top 10 stock to buy according to Thomas Steyer's Farallon Capital. The firm provides communication services and is headquartered in Washington. According to the latest filings, Farallon Capital Management owned 3.4 million shares in the company at the end of the second quarter of 2021 worth $499.4 million, representing 2.22% of the portfolio.***At the end of the second quarter of 2021, 100 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $8.02 billion in T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), up from 98 the preceding quarter worth $9.06 billion***"
AAPL and TMUS share price have been neck and neck all year. Now TMUS is lower by $35! Will TMUS quickly catch up after earnings? That's alot of juice if so! Worth holding at least some thru earnings...will Sievert and team deliver??
"all cable operators are using VZ network, so probably a better bet . and 5% divi"
"Masa Son sold his huge stake to DT for approx. $103 per share shortly after the merger. If that is the price both major parties were satisfied with, it would be safe to bet around $100 is the max pain we will see. Although really, we're not that far from there now!"
Are lots of Boost Mobile customers porting out?
Insider purchases over last 6 months has been strong
What’s wrong with this stock
"The question is how much pain can att withstand by offering industry killer promotions? These free iPhones will cost them lots of cash which they need to pay dividends, reduce debt and invest in small cells and fibers. Analysts in general are skeptical that att can generate the promised 20 billions free cash flow after split. Most think it will be more like 15billion"
Per Yahoo finance: Stock performance in the past 6 months:T -18.56%VZ -7.36%TMUS -11.52%
"t-Mobil's service over the years has really plummeted over the years, the stock as way overvalued. even Verizon which has better service is cheaper as well as T but there management needs work so that beside the point. VZ is some much better the TMUS I think plus the dividends"
"On the bright side, it's better for DT to buy back shares at $100 than $150. Will be better for shareholder upside once bottom is reached and more shares are taken off the market at that low price. Short term pain for long term gain!"
The company is committed to return $60B to it's shareholders between 2023 and 2026. After that at least 18B a year. Which other company with Market cap of less than 150B committed to provide such returns? None. This is a long term gem that will pay more than 12.5% in cash return per year. Do the math...
