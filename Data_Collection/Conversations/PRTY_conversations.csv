What???? No helium ??????
"Everything Party City has done in the last year point to an increase in the stock price. They totally changed up management, closed underperforming stores and streamlined inventory and the stock is trading at an insanely low price to earning ratio around 5. The overall market is 4+ times that, depending on the industry. This truly can only go up unless there is a major issue, which I do not see. Management gets additional options at $7.5 and at $10. They have a vested interest in seeing the price escalate as they stand to make a lot of $$$. So do patient investors, like me. I bought the stock from $1.67 all the way up to $8.06 and don't forget, Clifford Sosin, who is a crazy smart investor, owns around 16,000,000 shares and he's not selling."
"With the end-of-year holiday season time, wide vaccine distribution, and pent-up demand, sounds like a great recipe for, rest-of-the-year success!!"
What a beautiful head and shoulders this has developed!!!!!!!
PC / HC for Halloween is a joke. Spirit is eating their lunch again this season. PRTY will be back under 5 before year end.
This time I sell half at $11.00 if it reaches $15.00 I’m good!
"These guys sell stuff for social gatherings during an era of social DISTANCING. That's a recipe for doom. Thank The Powers That Ought Not Be for that reality. Sad, but true."
We are gonna run this stock next week starting on Monday
Why the BIG drop today ? Is there bad news out there impacting this stock
"The fundamentals are on point. One of the best value stocks on the market. I'm calling it, 18 by Feb"
Bed Bath and Beyond dragging retail down
What would happen if $PRTY tied the knot with $GME or $AMZN. The retail space would make quite a party.
"USA to open up its borders to Canada next month !! Thanks giving, Halloween and then Christmas !! PARTY IS ONN!!!"
Home Depot says it sold out of an early drop of Halloween decor almost immediately Source CNBC
Company just posted new slides on their NextGen stores in the investor relations section of their website. Very bullish.
"It has been my experience that sooner or later an investor is going to come and eat these cheap shares up! Party City is trading in an extremely undervalued range. Even at this rate, and big investor is almost guaranteed a 10% annual return on its investment, if it can get in at this level. What an exciting opportunity!"
"Hedge Funds are favoring Party City for 2020 and if you look at the Options activity you can see the possible trajectory. Buy and hold you will make money . This could be at $6 - $7 by December 2020, that’s a 200% - 300% !! Good Luck to all the longs."
This will be $20+ by the end of the year!!!
Pump and Dump?
Where is Carl?$8.25 before $6.50 my friend. Party on!!!
But we have plenty helium.
I’m all inBought more todayI think we are going to need a strong message from the company to reverse trend. Maybe a leadership change?
I talked to the manager in Springfield Missouri and Halloween is way up over last year.
The Party City store where I live was really busy yesterday with a lot of people in line waiting to be checked out. This is right before Labor day and I believe that this is a good sign for Party City. IMO
Some short over on Stocktwits claims all Party City has is old merchandise. They posted a small pic and yes Party City in Springfield Missouri does have a small section of old costumes strategically located in the center aisle away from all the new merchandise.Pretty smart idea if you ask me because most people will walk buy it after they been through the Halloween section. Just like when they moved the balloons up next to the register.Shorty your party is about to be over.
"From the Walmart CFO this morning on earnings:Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview with CNBC that customers flocked to stores for items like luggage, party supplies and apparel as they were “coming out of hibernation.” Plus, he said, families have been buying backpacks and items for the classroom."
"Party City Holdco Inc.'s (NYSE:PRTY) 57% decline over the past year could present a recovery opportunity for investors.The party supplies retailer is making changes to its store estate, while its international growth plans could contribute to its successful financial turnaround.￼Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRTY. Click here to check it out.PRTY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PRTYPeter Lynch Chart of PRTYInternational opportunitiesThe company's sale of its Canadian retail assets in August to Canadian Tire could strengthen its financial outlook. Party City will utilize the proceeds from the transaction to reduce its leverage, which could improve its competitive position and reduce its overall risk from an investment perspective.In addition, the deal includes a supply agreement between Party City's manufacturing business, Amscan, and Canadian Tire. It has an initial term of 10 years and could benefit from Canadian Tires' plans to double sales across Party City locations in Canada over the next two years. This appears to be a realistic goal since over 90% of the country's population is within a 15-minute drive of a Party City store.The deal is similar to the franchise relationships that Party City has in Mexico, as well as its European and Australian retail agreements. It forms part of its international growth strategy, which could diversify its business and boost its growth rate.Store changesThe company opened three new smaller format concept stores in the second quarter. They are between 7,000 and 10,000 square foot test stores that offer unique assortments of the company's products in smaller markets that may not require one of its larger stores.Party City's smaller stores require 30% less inventory than its larger stores, but it expects them to deliver 90% of its larger stores' sales, according to its second-quarter update. This should equate to an improved return on investment for the business, as well as more time for employees to interact with customers. This could improve the company's customer conversion rates and boost its sales performance.The company closed 34 U.S. stores in the first half of 2019 as part of its strategy to close underperforming locations, reporting that its sales recapture rates from customers of closed stores were in line with its expectations. This could mean additional store closures could have a positive impact on its bottom line.Potential risksParty City's second-quarter sales and earnings figures were below its internal expectations. They were negatively impacted by a helium shortage across many of its markets, which caused the company's comparative sales to decline 2.1% in the second quarter.In addition, the business could be negatively impacted by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Its total annual purchases from China are around $150 million and are subject to tariffs. This could lead to Party City increasing its prices or accepting lower margins over the medium term, which may hurt its financial outlook.The company reported in its second-quarter results that it is making progress in procuring sufficient helium to satisfy customer demand. For example, it entered into an agreement that provides the business with 35% of its average monthly demand of helium.In response to the threat of tariffs on imports from China, the business is developing its manufacturing capabilities in other countries. For example, during the quarter, it concluded the final shipment of products from a new joint venture with one of its suppliers in Cambodia. This may gradually reduce its dependence on China, though in its quarterly update the company said it estimates the potential impact on its bottom line from existing tariffs will be less than $2 million in the current fiscal year.OutlookParty City is forecasted to post a 16% increase in earnings per share next year. Since it trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 5, its valuation suggests it has investment appeal.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned.Read more here:"

"How does this board feel about Friday's earnings? today's update that Credit Suisse is maintaining an Outperform on PRTY with a $4 price target, seems to not have trickled up yet. Assuming the past Q1 numbers are bad but that forecasting is positive this could still maintain a steady uptick."
"As of this time Party City was down on 2,847,437 shares in which is 152% higher than the daily avg. volume of 1,887,087 shares - dis ain't good!"
"Although I stay long and bullish, I am really concerned about supply and margin compression. All studies show that people want to spend more for Halloween and the Holidays on party than ever. But they plan to buy online, which is where most of PC competitors are. Party City is not exempt from manufacturing and logistics nightmares, with containers arriving late, shipping costs skyrocketting, labor shortage, raw material shortage and prices increase. For many months, the shelves were quite empty in their stores. For sure, they are streamlining their offer, and reducing the number of items for sale to focus more on best sellers, like balloons. They have also reduced quite a lot the number of coupons sent by emarketing. it used to be almost 3 days per week that you could get 15% off. it is gone now and only comes once in a while. But I still stay concerned... it could turn to be another BBBY story."
"we have pent up demand for large birthday parties, Halloween parties, etc. with delta now falling from peaks, PRTY will return to $10 a share within weeks."
When does the party start ? 
Buying the dip.... Party On!!!
"Party City Director just picked up another 4000 shares! Now he has over 80,000 shares!"
"Ignore the shorters - coming into Halloween, thanksgiving and Xmass - time to PARTY! Stock on an upward trajectory"
The government has not yet decided if people will be able to gather over Christmas. Fauci will make the determination by early Nov. Until then no parties.
"$PRTY is an officially $MEME stocks - look at call option contracts.10,000 call contract at $10 strike, Jan 2022 expiry for $0.80? that's $800K bet someone made."
"Anyone visited a Party City store recently?I did again last week, checking 5 of them here in Denver area, and I am concerned about the supply. For sure, people were all leaving with balloons, which is highly profitable.But the shelves for everything else are just empty. They have old discounted items on display to fill up the empty spaces, but that does not bring any revenue or margin. They ended up bringing down the Pinata from the highest shelves and the small helium tanks that are usually stocked in the warehouse area.And still, there were huge empty spaces with nothing for sale. The summer items? almost gone... no pool toys, nothing for tiki parties or toga, just a few left over for Luau Parties...I am wondering if they are not too slow in the reopening of the production, or stuck with containers problems, or problems at the ports, or anything else. This could be a major hit and a big miss to their forecast. They better have to be more prepared for Halloween."
I do give manager alot of credit for averting disaster the past couple of years but fair value is not 17 a share but I do think it is trading near the bottom of it's range...
