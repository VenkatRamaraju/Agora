Seeing a lot of chatter on my screeners for PRTY would not be shocked to see a nice pop this week
Good online sales and further announcement of their restructuring should push this over 2.5 post earnings
"In Nov 2019, their share price fell due to the Helium gas issue, which they have now resolved."
If they get into an air based product market they would make millions. Stock would sky rocket!
Could they be divesting the shares prior to a buy out of PRTY so that the individual investors owning those shares can make their own informed decision on when to sell?
"Not sure about the calls and do not trade in that venue and the Market Makers...hey might be right. When I look at a company I make sure I know something about the business. Bunch of folks that probably do not know the party biz have made some good bucks here. Especially the big buyers when it was in change. The way I see it, as opposed to this post, is Q3 WILL be bad. Summer is never good in the biz. If you are waiting for a good report I suspect not. This whole thing depends on Halloween. If that does not go well, the stock will run up on anticipation prior to Halloween and sink. Not sure what will happen. If I knew, I would spend a mint and collect. If you see huge sales at Walmart and other big retailers short of Halloween, that might be a sign. I wish you all well on this investment."
"Please stay sub-7 for one more day. I have some cash available to deploy tomorrow. Already added some at 6.71, but a little greed is causing me to want to add more."
I took profit too only kept a small amount of shares. 4.89 premarket. will be back for round 7 soon :) good luck yall and happy thanksgiving!!!!
Are there any predictions for tomorrows call ?
This will fly today. Shorts already starting to cover premarket
"Ignore the shorters - coming into Halloween, thanksgiving and Xmass - time to PARTY! Stock on an upward trajectory"
"we have pent up demand for large birthday parties, Halloween parties, etc. with delta now falling from peaks, PRTY will return to $10 a share within weeks."
"Just remember Halloween wasn’t on last quarters earnings. I talked to a mgr and they had a $17,000.00 day NYE"
How many of you agreeing that PRTY price will go up next week ... min $2 by Friday.. Hit like if you agree.
First stock I invested in. Did some research into some other forums. Happy with my outcome. Bought in at $0.99. waiting the long haul on this one
The government has not yet decided if people will be able to gather over Christmas. Fauci will make the determination by early Nov. Until then no parties.
Where is Carl?$8.25 before $6.50 my friend. Party on!!!
PRTY has been around for over 80 years. They will weather this storm and get Wall Street respect back. People love these stores during the holidays and Wall Street is expecting a YUGE Christmas. Get the shares now while on clearance price.
$8.06 right now...I see this company hitting $10 in a few months. Nothing else can beat what they are offering in the USA. All one stop shop with competitive pricing and transaction convenience...
Just heard a big deal is in play for PRTY....Awesome news. Stocks will soar
Party City is maintained at outperform by Credit Suisse https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PRTY/ratings
"Big Money in control of PRTY going forward. Likely slow, small and steady moves for a few more days."
"Bought a 1000 shares when this was .50 and it tanked lol. I bought another 1000 shares because I like balloons.Forgot all about it. Up 45% and an additional 4.28% AH. ""Welcome to the party"" they say"
"Bout 35000 shares yesterday starting at 2.40 then averaged down. I normally buy half first then 25% times two if it keeps dropping but I went “almost all in” expecting the bounce. Also trading kicked in and day traders kept flipping in and out and I was not surprised it kept selling off into the close. I would have bought another 35000, but couldn’t do it because margin rules didn’t apply due to the price. I am super excited with my position and I see 5 plus in the near future.we will all be making money folks..."
Now on the way to 13 trading days above $1.00. Good luck Longs.
"Alot of you are forgetting that the coronavirus will have a huge impact on party city. Most of their vendors are in China and with factory slowdowns, they are in line to lose millions. It's unfortunate, as I had planned on buying back in close to the ER, but I'm now wary as to how this virus will impact the company down the road. Is 1.78 a huge discount? YES, BUT there are a lot of unknowns moving forward, especially with this virus. Be careful."
"I love how shorts will say sell it’s going to $1.50. Answer this intelligent shorty.Why was 500,000 shares just purchased at $2.00 by an insider?"
Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating and price target $4 Report from June 2020
"I'm excited about Brad as CEO. He really reminds me of Steve Jobs with his vision for Party City. He said that Party City needs to""pivot from a store operations and maintenance culture to a customer engagement and selling culture."" That is EXACTLY on point! I'm willing to give him some time to pursue this AWESOME vision. For those writing Party City off ... you will be disappointed. Even with the tough year last year, there was still positive income made, the debt was paid down, and there is still $35 million in cash on hand, and a $350 million facility available. Trading at around .50 now, this is truly a $10 or more stock ... TODAY! The coronavirus may slow things down for all of us, but I'm encouraged, Party City is in a position to be impressive over the next several years, under Brad's leadership."
I do give manager alot of credit for averting disaster the past couple of years but fair value is not 17 a share but I do think it is trading near the bottom of it's range...
I really am starting to think that 2.40ish is where we are heading. we dropped on Friday due to less buying not selling pressure. I would think they would try to wipe all the after earnings buyers before heading higher.
why would people sell its just about to get good. im still holding
The Party City store where I live was really busy yesterday with a lot of people in line waiting to be checked out. This is right before Labor day and I believe that this is a good sign for Party City. IMO
CEO just bought 100K shares
The last time it sold off like this is 2016 it went from $6 to $18. And the company is in a lot better position today then it was 3 years go. Plus they sold off the Canadian Stores and will use that money to pay down debt. I also like the 2 new board members they added last week. from Hasbro and Boot Barn.
"There is no doubt that PRTY will expand their model to cover more items like chips, drinks, beer, food, etc going forward. They are competing with grocery as much as WMT or TGT. They have a great niche to allow them to restructure the model. If so, these high turn, high margin items will drive incremental growth. All about how they continue to refinance debt and manage CAPEX."
"Kind of new to stocks, are you guys still holding? i barely have around 250 shares and just looking to make a couple hundred, a lot of people were saying they will see 4$ but i’m not sure about that. does anyone think it’ll go back up to 2$?"
Home Depot says it sold out of an early drop of Halloween decor almost immediately Source CNBC
"I own a few thousand shares, but will wait until the lockout period expires before buying some serious shares."
PC / HC for Halloween is a joke. Spirit is eating their lunch again this season. PRTY will be back under 5 before year end.
The store by my house was very busy and had quite a few people inside. I think they were getn ready to PRTY!!!!
"I’m not sure who got the $1.68 shares. I had a large order waiting at $1.68 and my broker could not fill it. Oh well, I was fortunate enough to get some in the $1.70’s. All of the shares traded today were STEALS. Really a gift at these prices."
Company just posted new slides on their NextGen stores in the investor relations section of their website. Very bullish.
"8.00+ stock all day long and make no mistake, it will get there."
"Party City now expects 2019 revenue in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.38 billion, down from $2.40 billion to $2.45 billion it forecast earlier.Harrison said annual results would also include an impact from helium shortages, higher freight and distribution costs.Party City cut its full-year earnings forecast to 84 cents to 91 cents per share, much lower than its prior range of $1.26 to $1.36 per share. I'm in. GLTA"
"$PRTY is easily the best trade of the last two quarters so far. ""If you look at Party City’s filings, you’ll see this. In August, value investor Clifford Sosin added to his growing position in PRTY stock. He purchased over 1.6 million shares during that period.""https://valuemarket.exchange/4x29h"
Ouch
I road the wave from $2.80 to $5.25 and am out. Good luck longs. I still see some good upward movement ahead of you.
Company needs to restore confidence. Needs to make leadership changes. Current leadership has decimated shareholder value. We need leadership changes and a couple good quarters to get this stock up
"I have made a lot of money in the market as a pattern trader. I was initially going to jump in and out of this stock; however, after doing some research, I’ve decided to go long with it. There are some of us that will get wealthy from this wonderful and soon to be prosperous company. I salute each and every one of you."
About time for a short squeeze don’t ya think;)
New form 4Another Board member - Conray Grant - bought shares
I personally think PRTY is flooding the market with shares to the tune of about 15 million. I saw the outstanding shares go from about 95m to over 110m. Once those shares are scooped up we are headed to over $5.
"For all the pessimist's out there look at Cass investment's the guys running this,Clifford Sosin and Lance Ettus have purchased 10 millon + shares the last 3 months. If you look at there track record you will see what these guys are doing is nothing short of Amazing. Not to mention 3 directors have also made purchases of over 240.000 shares. get on the bandwagon now before it's to late."
"I am holding since since $0.45, I have faith in the business and leadership it will emerge as a strong business in near future. certain conditions will make the SP spike. the stimulus package after the election and any therapeutic or vaccine for covid19 will help spike the price. GLTA Longs"
should probably see a steady climb after lunch hour. i think we can close $1.50 today.
Sold at 4.92 based on a gut feeling. Cost at 1.71. GLTA who stayed in!
What would happen if $PRTY tied the knot with $GME or $AMZN. The retail space would make quite a party.
"I briefly looked at the finanancial statements. If it wasn't for the significant impairment loss, the financial statements and sales look good to me. Investors need to learn how to read the financial statements. The impairment loss is because of the drop in Stock price...should not have caused such a sell off."
everyone is so quiet now that Party City is back on the map. All of my longs must have already gotten out. Am I the last one standing????
"Jump of 33% of total visits on their website. Increase in average visit duration and drop in bounce rate...Except Halloween period, with 4.5M visitors on their website, this is the best numbers they had for a very long time..."
"The 15 day lockup only applies to the 6,054,002 shares distributed to the general partner. The 29,662,256 shares distributed to the limited partners does not have a lockup period so they could have already been sold at their discretion. Maybe this was the major cause for the 11/13 drop (8.5 million trading volume)? This is the SEC filing: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1592058/000119312519290608/d827598d8k.htm When does the 15 trading day lock-up end for the general partner? 11/27? I want to go in but maybe wait until the 15 day lock-up. Thoughts?"
I’m all inBought more todayI think we are going to need a strong message from the company to reverse trend. Maybe a leadership change?
We will be in the green today. Classic shaking of the trees to get stock by the sharks
who is on this train for the $5.00 per share Station? all aboard
Anyone else was holding since March at .40 cents and sold at 3 dollars knows the pain I’m feeling
A short run is due. Huge number of shorts. I think they realize they have seen the lows.
MATH MATH MATH: This company has revenue of $2.5 Billions per year. Market Cap is $190 Million. It doesn’t make any sense. Way OVERSOLD

"All longs should place a sell order over $4.00 and keep walking it up as the trend reverses. By placing a sell, your shares can’t be borrowed and if everyone does, the short squeeze will start and the move will be swift to the upside once it does. They have the right head merchant in place now to streamline assortment like tablecloths from 32 sku’s to 20 without sacrificing sales, which will help with better merchandising of add on products and freeing up shelf space and merchandise dollars to expand hot categories or test new ones. They are doing all of the right things with Bopis from Amazon marketplace and the possibilities are endless to add assortment online and drive footsteps into the store and create opportunities for additional sales on pick-up.Management seems to know what they need to do and are talking to customers to get feedback at a granular level versus others that show hubris thinking they know it all. We are well positioned to surprise on next earnings and reach new highs next year. The market will continue to get that helium is back, and their partners at wholesale level will also start to get back in stock driving sales through that channel. Canadian tire is already forecasting doubling purchasing of consumer goods through the wholesale arm. More big customers will be added.We are also a buy-out candidate from the likes of Walmart or even Amazon as the purchase of whole foods would lead to making this a much better deal in terms of prospects. Tax loss selling has been done early and big boys will be and are loading up. They are focused on costs and improvements in margins and this is one of the times where you can get your hands on an easy 5 bagger plus in a year or much more. Triple in less than six months."
Terrific quarter.
Why the BIG drop today ? Is there bad news out there impacting this stock
Not just PRTy overall market is opening down. NASDAQ is down big time. Let wait for opening.
"Next stop is approximately $12.80. I believe will happen in the coming 1-2 weeks. After that, $16.80. Party’s business is on fire."
"Party city is considering partnering up with another company possibly in Canada, which could be the possible reason why board members are mass buying. This could be announced on November 5th, along with the earnings."
"I sold mine at 3.35, should have waited more. anyhow good luck to all Longs."
"This can touch $10 very easily, The company is good situation and has good leadership with good business strategy."
Nice Cup and Handle pattern on daily Chart. We Broke the Handle Resistance wich means we could hit 3.33$ soon and if we are able to fill the gap we could go to 5.25$ !
Bought another couple of thousand aftermarket. Once the earnings are settled back to $2.00
"Hedge Funds are favoring Party City for 2020 and if you look at the Options activity you can see the possible trajectory. Buy and hold you will make money . This could be at $6 - $7 by December 2020, that’s a 200% - 300% !! Good Luck to all the longs."
"Glad to see the latest Short article posted by a Seeking Alpha poster had little effect. He estimates worth between .95 and 3.75. Talks about ""continued helium shortage"". As a major helium supplier to the Balloon Industry (Dollar Tree, etc.) ... there is no shortage of helium for the US market as several large independent wells have increased availability both here and in Canada."
"Look at a 6 month chart... From February 27th to now, looks like a ""cup"" without the handle formation. Only move is UP!"
I don't get it ... why is this tanking with the results they had ?
"Mr. Vogensen Seems solid. Nice how they snuck in the low comparables with this announcement. But, the valuation is so low now, I would not expect a market reaction to anything. At this rate, the share price will increase, even with bad news. It is soooo oversold."
"Does anyone remember what happened in 3Q20? Numbers were not that bad, and now they forecast 3Q21 lower than 3Q20 in rev and profit. Strange...Hard to understand... Over cautious., or a one-time event in 3Q20?Now, it will take outstanding numbers for Q3 and huge Halloween sales to be back to $10+...Worth the wait but painful"
"Lightning Round 12/16/20Jim Cramer said ""No we're not going to party with Party City. It's way too risky"". So I bought more share :-)"
"PRTY could possibility DOUBLE, quickly! Even before the earnings report! This is exciting!!!"
Party is already gearing up for Halloween. I did take 500 shares off but have a $1.34 avg for 4000 shares
"I'm seeing a lot of reactions to the share price. With a company this levered, this volatility is not abnormal. Guided '19 EBITDA decreased $48mm. At a 6x EV/EBITDA multiple, a drop in share price of ~$3.7 was warranted."
"The lock up period is ONLY for 6.5 mil shares and not the entire 35 mil shares. Anyway, the selling is done and big block have gone through in the past 2 weeks. This thing is under accumulation and will pop soon once good news come out or whenever MM feels like it. $3 is the next leg up easy.......Down on low volume means manipulation."
annnd BOOM Goes the Dynamite. like I said: $4.90 target = 90% possible by Black Friday. 100% by christmas. but remember. i did fail Trigonometry in highschool
Also great analysis of our current situation. Notice the mega increase of ownership from institutional investors. https://www.uspostnews.com/2020/05/04/is-party-city-holdco-inc-prty-dependable-investment-for-investors/
"Saw the same rhetoric with PCG (with a fire) and that bounced back 40% Day 2. Earnings did not deserve a 67% drop in price. PartyCity stores are not going away, over a billion in revenue does not just disappear. Tomorrow early buyers/ex short sellers will swop in and buy this up. Still ridiculous to drop that much"
Zacks just posted their party city unusual option activity so you know Thomas H Lee’s buddy’s know the short is on.
This will be $20+ by the end of the year!!!
"So it seems like everyone lost interest in this stock....but little do they know.....this party is just going to start. I really dont see this dropping further. As I said before, I am in big enough with 35,000 shares. I sold some off before we dropped, in order to get into YELL....still down but not concerned. This stock is going to be a winner for April. Tomorrow is a new month and we are going to see rebalancing of portfolio's. April starts a new quarter and I see this making up new ground. Get in now before you start thinking its too high."
Earnings next weekIm ready for the rebound
I was thinking buying PRTY here between $7-8 as a 5 year investment. Thoughts?
CAS partners just bought another traunch of shares... two purchases announced in past two weeks
What I don’t understand is why did the insiders buy some of these shares at much higher prices? It has to be shorted way down.
"From the company website:""Reopening stores: We’re excited to announce that as of May 1st, we’ll begin reopening stores in areas the government permits. However, we’re dedicated to your safety and taking the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe. """
When does the party start ? 
"Bought 5000 shares at $0.38 back at the first COVID drop. We struggled to hang on a few times there, but I can't believe how incredible this ride has been!! I might be done. Any thoughts on where this might go from here? Should I take my profit and run?"
Holding 3000 shares all on the house plus some. Not much compared to a lot of you but not shabby either.
"Party City: A Specialty Retailer, An Overlevered Balance Sheet, And A Cheap StockPRTY has a startling 12-month stock chart, being down 75% over the course of a year.The equity market is pricing the stock in such a way that implies the business will be gone in short order.We don't view that outcome as likely, and think PRTY makes for a great candidate in a specialty retail basket.With 40% of the float short, the stock trades at ~5x EV/EBTIDA and at a 35% earnings yield.Party City (PRTY) has seen its share price drop by 50% in the past 6 months, 75% in the past 12 months, and is close to 90% off the highs. The stock price has fallen such that the market must be implying impending bankruptcy for the company. While near-term results have been disappointing, we don't share the market's dire outlook. Party City is a specialty retail company with a lot of debt (almost 5x EBITDA). And like most leveraged retailers, the market has not been kind to the company's share price. We believe the narrative that e-commerce will put to bed all brick and mortar stores has been taken too far in the equity market. The narrative that all sales will be done online is an over-simplistic view and lacks nuance. If the company is able to shake off near-term headwinds, we believe the stock could go up 5-fold and still be relatively cheap.The Business - Overview And BackgroundParty City is a dominant player in the party goods industry (costumes, make-up, decorations, candy, etc.). The company has over 900 party superstore locations (which includes 150 franchisees) in North America. During Halloween the company also operates ~250-300 temporary stores under the Halloween City banner. The company's business doesn't need much elaboration other than to note that the company is a specialty retailer; while other retailers may offer similar products, Party City specializes in this specific segment. Further, the industry is extensively fragmented as every major retailer competes in some way in the space.Party City today is the combination of Amscan - which acquired Party City in 2005 - and Party City. Amscan (~25% of sales) is a designer/manufacturer/distributor of party products while Party City (~75% of sales) is a retailer of party products. As seen below, roughly 80% of the company's products offered are sourced internally which gives the company an advantage over peers. Being vertically integrated means the company can more seamlessly shift strategy and respond to consumer demands.(Source: 2018 Presentation)The Market Can't Read TranscriptsWhile the business has clearly run into short-term operational headwinds, that's exactly what they are - short term. We believe the market is misconstruing transient headwinds for a long-term secular decline in the business when in actuality revenue and margins have held up relatively nicely in the past 3 years. Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) revenue and EBIT figures are $2.4 billion and $195 million, respectively. While 2016 figures were $2.28 billion and $274 million, respectively. While these numbers certainly aren't stellar, we believe the market has become far too pessimistic on the company's outlook. Let's discuss why that might be for a minute.Firstly, practically all retailers have seen their share prices hit dramatically in the past couple of years. This is for good reason. Many likely won't make it through this next decade as online and e-commerce are preferable for consumers on many metrics. However, while that's true at one level there's not enough nuance in that view. Meaning, just because online shopping on average is preferable for consumers does not mean all brick and mortar is going away.Conceptually, it is very easy to see why when you give it a moment's thought. Consumers who don't have the luxury of waiting 2 days for their package to arrive have no choice but to stop by a physical store. This is especially so for a retailer specializing in party products. While more general and smaller stores are very likely to get squeezed out of the market in the coming years, specialty stores like Party City are likely to hold their own. We believe this thesis is borne out by the company's financials:(Source: Company)We don't see a company in distress here. We believe the company has a viable business model over the long term. So what about recent results? During the past two quarters, the company found themselves in the unenviable position of having supply chain issues while the broader industry had a relatively weak Halloween sales season. As a result, looking past fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, consolidated revenue was down 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Accordingly, management updated guidance for FY'19 revenue to be down 2%-3% and EBITDA to be down ~15% from prior guidance to $305 million. Given the leverage"
Did anyone see the Initial Statement of Ownership filed? Maybe I’m wrong but looks like someone just bought 10M shares....?
Shorts will be covering soon
Buying the dip.... Party On!!!
"I see PRTY returning to over $5 per share, in no time. Wholesale and retail. HUGE market share! One quarter does not determine the destiny of large company like this. This is a bargain."
They need to start a share buyback program ASAP
Should be back to flat by close. Let's go. Easy money today. Gotta take advantage of these free days. Don't get many
But we have plenty helium.
"Your money is fine stop selling. I bought most of my shares at $0.38, it shortly after climbed to $0.75 and then fell back to $0.48 before reaching $1.30 less than 2 weeks later. It will go back up just be patient."
"I always say that, when the Market is down Party still remains up. Not every stock can do that. GLTA longs."
I made a trip to Party City today probably 15 shoppers today. They are expecting a busy Halloween this year and they had a table set out with employment applications!

TH Lee spent 2.7B in 2012 for 55% share of Party City. They are not selling at these levels folks lol.
"I might be off by a little bit plus minus 10-30 cents, but considering a short squeeze is certainly coming very soon and if the daily trend continues this might hit $2.90+ by Thursday."
"Party City Holdco Inc.'s (NYSE:PRTY) 57% decline over the past year could present a recovery opportunity for investors.The party supplies retailer is making changes to its store estate, while its international growth plans could contribute to its successful financial turnaround.￼Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRTY. Click here to check it out.PRTY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PRTYPeter Lynch Chart of PRTYInternational opportunitiesThe company's sale of its Canadian retail assets in August to Canadian Tire could strengthen its financial outlook. Party City will utilize the proceeds from the transaction to reduce its leverage, which could improve its competitive position and reduce its overall risk from an investment perspective.In addition, the deal includes a supply agreement between Party City's manufacturing business, Amscan, and Canadian Tire. It has an initial term of 10 years and could benefit from Canadian Tires' plans to double sales across Party City locations in Canada over the next two years. This appears to be a realistic goal since over 90% of the country's population is within a 15-minute drive of a Party City store.The deal is similar to the franchise relationships that Party City has in Mexico, as well as its European and Australian retail agreements. It forms part of its international growth strategy, which could diversify its business and boost its growth rate.Store changesThe company opened three new smaller format concept stores in the second quarter. They are between 7,000 and 10,000 square foot test stores that offer unique assortments of the company's products in smaller markets that may not require one of its larger stores.Party City's smaller stores require 30% less inventory than its larger stores, but it expects them to deliver 90% of its larger stores' sales, according to its second-quarter update. This should equate to an improved return on investment for the business, as well as more time for employees to interact with customers. This could improve the company's customer conversion rates and boost its sales performance.The company closed 34 U.S. stores in the first half of 2019 as part of its strategy to close underperforming locations, reporting that its sales recapture rates from customers of closed stores were in line with its expectations. This could mean additional store closures could have a positive impact on its bottom line.Potential risksParty City's second-quarter sales and earnings figures were below its internal expectations. They were negatively impacted by a helium shortage across many of its markets, which caused the company's comparative sales to decline 2.1% in the second quarter.In addition, the business could be negatively impacted by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Its total annual purchases from China are around $150 million and are subject to tariffs. This could lead to Party City increasing its prices or accepting lower margins over the medium term, which may hurt its financial outlook.The company reported in its second-quarter results that it is making progress in procuring sufficient helium to satisfy customer demand. For example, it entered into an agreement that provides the business with 35% of its average monthly demand of helium.In response to the threat of tariffs on imports from China, the business is developing its manufacturing capabilities in other countries. For example, during the quarter, it concluded the final shipment of products from a new joint venture with one of its suppliers in Cambodia. This may gradually reduce its dependence on China, though in its quarterly update the company said it estimates the potential impact on its bottom line from existing tariffs will be less than $2 million in the current fiscal year.OutlookParty City is forecasted to post a 16% increase in earnings per share next year. Since it trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 5, its valuation suggests it has investment appeal.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned.Read more here:"

"With Y2021 EBITDA around $200M, I think it finally turned it around which reminds me of Michael's (acquired by PE early this year).PartyCity is a long term cash cow play - lots of upside as it didn't start party rental business (chairs/inflatables), cleaning business (before/after party), goodie bag for guests, warehouse/bouncy house."
New insider purchase Board member just filed 4 (Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership) SEC Filing showing he just bought 250k shares at $2.00 each
I've got a long way to go to get out of the red on this one but I'll take this increase!
"This os a weak earnings report yes but a 70% crush on over a billion in revenues, thats crazy. This should run back tomorrow towards $3 quickly. I am all in at avg. price of $2.56 will be sitting tight and watching it rise."
"When insiders buy a ton of shares in an oddball company like this pay attention cause youll make a lot of money the company has to be unique though, look at what happened to KIRK insiders showed the same hunger then that stock went from $2 to $12 then came back down from the highs all im saying is don't be surprised if PRTY goes to $5 by October GLTA"
something to think about:- stock tanked due to a poor earning- stock tanked further as its major shareholder (private equity firm) announced distribution to its another funds aka vehicles- CEO bought $232k worth of stocks- one director bought $60k worth of stocks- another director bought $500k worth of stocksdidn't we see this from other companies like GE in this August?- GE announced its earning not meeting the expectation- street questioned GE about its pension aka contingent liabilities- whistle blower put out an article that GE had no value and regulators must audit them- CEO bought $2m worth of stocks- one director bought $280k worth of stocks- another director bought $85k worth of stocks- SVP of the company bought $1m worth of stocks result on GE? the stock price went up by 50%sometimes the market is not efficient than the insiders.
"""In the second quarter, we expect our consolidated sales to be approximately $475 million to $490 million, with the brand comp sales increase in the 92% to 97% range versus the comparable 13-week period in 2020 or a mid- to high single-digit increase versus the comparable period in 2019. Lastly, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million."""
"Party City EPS misses by $0.06, revenue in-line"
"did anyone notice someone bought over 2m shares end day, and someone bought quarter million toward end day over each of the past few days, or am I just seeing things? I have been stuck with this stock with significant loss for a while now, hoping it will go back up to the 4s. thumb up if you think it will before feb 2020!"
"With the end-of-year holiday season time, wide vaccine distribution, and pent-up demand, sounds like a great recipe for, rest-of-the-year success!!"
"$PRTY is an officially $MEME stocks - look at call option contracts.10,000 call contract at $10 strike, Jan 2022 expiry for $0.80? that's $800K bet someone made."
Debt restructuring is ongoing and will help deleverage ... also going to reduce number of outstanding shares
I would like to see Weston and other insiders buying at this price level. We need some confidence here that this business can get through the challenging times we are in...
"According to Level II order book data, both yesterday and today the sell pressure is a lot less then the buy pressure. Bodes good for the near term it looks like!"
Who has held this stock a long time? Why did the price drop drastically like $4.00 overnight last November? It would certainly be nice to see it at $4.00 but I’m doubtful being it was $2.00 last Nov. Could someone please enlighten me? Thanks
Patience will be rewarded here
"Book to Market 642%. If you know of another company with sales over a billion, with a Book to Market that high, a PE of 1.6 and forward PE of 1.4. let me know."
"CoStar Article: “Party City Plans 20 ‘Next-Gen’ Stores in First Quarter.” Party City is going to see some great growth here and they recently noted that they plan to further improve and expand its omnichannel capabilities, offering curbside pickup, “buy online, pick up in-store,” or BOPIS, and helium balloon delivery. The next-gen stores are going to create major efficiency for Party City. I feel that these next-gen stores that are currently being built are not being talked about enough. This is huge for party city especially since the costume market was valued at $32.9 billion in 2019 and is estimated to reach $59.7 billion by 2027 and their market cap is under $650 million. Within a year when we start to see the benefits of these stores I am expecting to see the market cap push $2 billion or $17.5 a share. Just for disclosure, I bought my large position yesterday and I’m going to hold for around a year or two depending on how fast this stock rallies."
"Anyone visited a Party City store recently?I did again last week, checking 5 of them here in Denver area, and I am concerned about the supply. For sure, people were all leaving with balloons, which is highly profitable.But the shelves for everything else are just empty. They have old discounted items on display to fill up the empty spaces, but that does not bring any revenue or margin. They ended up bringing down the Pinata from the highest shelves and the small helium tanks that are usually stocked in the warehouse area.And still, there were huge empty spaces with nothing for sale. The summer items? almost gone... no pool toys, nothing for tiki parties or toga, just a few left over for Luau Parties...I am wondering if they are not too slow in the reopening of the production, or stuck with containers problems, or problems at the ports, or anything else. This could be a major hit and a big miss to their forecast. They better have to be more prepared for Halloween."
The volume tells the tale. Already traded daily avg with 3 hours left.
"USA to open up its borders to Canada next month !! Thanks giving, Halloween and then Christmas !! PARTY IS ONN!!!"
"Reported 3 new insider trades to the SEC 166,415 shares acquired by Thompson Sean78,313 shares acquired by Vogensen Todd E. (Chief Financial Officer) 33,885 shares acquired by Kulikowsky Denise (Chief Human Resources Officer)"
What am I missing here?
Monday morning can’t get here soon enough. If they barely miss earnings and it drops 20% I know what to do I buy more.
"i dont even worry about how prty going right now,and it's just the floating that you usually see in the market with person investors. What i am posting this right now to let you guys know at the Q3 it had done great job, and in siders has traded 2.48M at the Q1 2021 that mean somethings. As we see at the Q3 Q4 of the revenues i am confident about prty city in 2021"
"Buy, buy, buy. This free money"
"How does this board feel about Friday's earnings? today's update that Credit Suisse is maintaining an Outperform on PRTY with a $4 price target, seems to not have trickled up yet. Assuming the past Q1 numbers are bad but that forecasting is positive this could still maintain a steady uptick."
"Don’t understand how they can be off estimates, should have been a little more conservative with Q4 guidance. I’d rather underestimate than overestimate.... not like Covid is anything new at this point. Still bullish but annoyed!"
"As of this time Party City was down on 2,847,437 shares in which is 152% higher than the daily avg. volume of 1,887,087 shares - dis ain't good!"
Did I goof up buying 1000 shares @ 2.60? I feel like it'll eventually get to that point and higher but I'm probably in for the long run.
I bought 5k on 1.38 now I scared for long term or short term ?? Is that good price please suggest me thanks
Party stated that June comps were only slightly down vs last year and July was favorable. Balloon strategy seems to be working. Debt restructuring seems successful and liquidity position better. Now they need to figure out how to make Halloween a success ... despite Covid parents will still buy costumes... I know I will be buying them for my kids
Party city will get back to the old trading range of $11.00-18.00
"Thanks to poor earnings, this is one of the cheapest vaccine/recovery plays left."
besides the HUGE institutional buyers....... guys just LOOK at that giant GAP around $5.00. a 3 year old would tell you this is a technical buy!
"From the Walmart CFO this morning on earnings:Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview with CNBC that customers flocked to stores for items like luggage, party supplies and apparel as they were “coming out of hibernation.” Plus, he said, families have been buying backpacks and items for the classroom."
What a beautiful head and shoulders this has developed!!!!!!!
"Party city is going staple with low volumes, I estimated share price about to 10-15"
"I work at Party City, curbside pickup started at our store, did about 800.00 day average, then soon as stores opened 1200 Mon to wed, Thursday fri sat went over 4000 each day. I think it's temporary because it's mostly graduation sales and casual birthdays at home. might pick up with summer sales but once we run out of grad balloons sales will stay low until Halloween season starting end of August to November. best time to buy seems to be when the report comes out next week. buy low next week and wait it out until mid October. seems like a long wait, but I think 1stQ report will drop stock to near 20cents per share. can turn 1000 into 5k in a few months"
didn't I tell you guys? go back and read my post. I had confidence in this company.
Also you better believe once they announce physical stores REOPENING this is going to fly to $1 +
Bed Bath and Beyond dragging retail down
"This is exactly what the $2 Trillion dollar government package is supposed to avoid ... companies getting pushed over due to the Coronavirus. Party City has to qualify for millions in grants or government loans! There are THOUSANDS of jobs on the line here. The US should not let a good company go down. With the current low interest rates, bond holders and investors should also be willing to rework things and restructure, short of chapter 11. This is very disturbing but I’m hopeful for the best."
"They have a great CEO with a new vision that will put Party back on the map. Corona hit hard just after commencement of the new plan roll out. 1.More eye appealing stores. 2.Islands instead of endless rows. 3. Balloon point of sale to speed up general merchandise sales. 4. PARTY PLANNERS to assist customers and drive sales. 5. Updating current inventory to reflect current customer needs and trends. Most importantly making the transition from a sales oriented store to a customer first based environment. With these changes Party will no doubt be a powerfull player in this arena going forward and one of the great survivor stories of this Pandemic. Hold long and strong. ""Welcome to the Party"""
"It has been my experience that sooner or later an investor is going to come and eat these cheap shares up! Party City is trading in an extremely undervalued range. Even at this rate, and big investor is almost guaranteed a 10% annual return on its investment, if it can get in at this level. What an exciting opportunity!"
First closing above $1.00 since Nasdaq notification. Good luck Longs!!
"Bought 300,000 shares @ .26 cents.... Sold today @ $1.84"
"I work at PRTY in SoCal and every week is busier than the last. I noticed that the floor was dead yesterday (sunday), my coworker laughed and said maybe before, as he inflated balloon order after balloon-order and online order printed after online-order. The Ballon station that they implemented next to the register is REALLY driving sales!!! All while the floor gets a handful of customers...Balloons are their highest profit-margin product, which only reaffirms, to me,that this company is too focused on having expansive retail locations, when they could get away with a small venues, balloon stations, and EXTREMELY comprehensive curb-side, delivery, and e-comm platforms. As well as, focusing on becoming less of a brand and more of a wholesale supplier for everyone. I think it relies on its physical locations to pay off its massive debt, so it can't implement a plan like that on a dime, it's a shipping container, NOT a jet-ski."
"$PRTY real party coming week.. forecasting $2-$3, it may go higher Guys - Grab enough before it go higher :)https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/frozen-ii-soars-127-million-163902989.html"
could anybody explain the reason for the trend over the past few trading days?
Been a wild ride I was down almost $30k on this at one point and now I’m up $5k Taking chips off the table
"Joseph. Not sure how many shares u had but you lost money either way. We welcome you back anytime buying in at higher price. And if things don't workout for you, you can always get a job as one of the 20,000 people Party is hiring for Halloween"
Pump and Dump?
"It's heading to 2 easily but my only worry about the earnings, the first quarter the stock was falling"
Y’all remember how many shares the insiders bought about a year ago with their own money? Hundreds of thousands. They haven’t sold a bit and it’s been longer than 6 months. They’d had dumped them at $11.00 if they believed it was overpriced then.
Party is booming. If you guys are selling your shares at any price below $20 until Feb of 2021 I am sorry to say you are not investors you are merely penny collectors. Stay Patient and Long. GLTA.
"I honestly think more people are going to go out and buy Halloween stuff and just do things around the house than trick or treat, maybe spend more and make there own house party with the kids than go out so I see more upside."
"13.2 million shares off the shelf at $2.88, filed with SEC yesterday."
"We're seeing an earlier then normal profit taking albeit relatively small one, on the sharp upwards market bounce. Level II open book order are fairly even as of writing this. Some large pending sales at $1.72/73. Large buy's at $1.61. Should end the day at least 10% up like the 3 last trading days."
"Looks like that’s about all she wrote for today, definitely was nice seeing a pop over 2.00 though, even if it was only momentarily. Looking forward to seeing it consistently above $2 next week"
"JP Morgan just undisclosed they have 670,000 calls and insiders have bought up near 350,000 shares past 2 days. Bullish much here hahaha"
2 MILLION BUY BLOCK @$1.80 TODAY AND 800k..... INTERESTING
Where does everyone see the price of this stock exactly 1 year from today?Thinking about investing into this stock and holding for a year or two.What's everyone's thoughts?Thanks!
This thing is too cheap. Their non-retail business alone worth much more. It's priced for bankruptcy at this point. Management or an activist should do something. Send out a sign. Do something. C'mon ppl.
"This won't break $3 until Oct 19. Reason being is that the OI on OTM Oct 16 calls is 18,000... MMs are going to hold this down so they profit all that premium. With no catalyst between now and Oct 16, and with a mkt cap of $280MM, it won't be that hard for MMs to suppress. Welcome to the world of micro-cap stocks. MMs run the show. Starting Oct 19, this will begin a run up to $3.6-4 by Nov 5. Then we'll see how the quarterly report goes. If the report is bullish, as I expect, then I think we'll see the gap fill up to $6-7 by Nov 13."
"These guys sell stuff for social gatherings during an era of social DISTANCING. That's a recipe for doom. Thank The Powers That Ought Not Be for that reality. Sad, but true."
"Not sure what happened to all of the discussions about how the stock has seen its last days at $2.50 range and how the options were all priced at $2.50/share and that once the expirations hit, the stock was going to move up."
Huge volume today. Might be able to hit $1 tomorrow.
I sold at 3.85. today experiencing a bit of seller's remorse...congratulations to the longs
