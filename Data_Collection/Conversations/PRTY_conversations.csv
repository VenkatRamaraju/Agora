About time for a short squeeze don’t ya think;)
What's going on. Huge drop yesterday and today. No news.
"nobody wastes money anymore on gaudy cheap plastic and paper props, decorations, or costumes made in sweatshops. IMHO The party is over"
"Lightning Round 12/16/20Jim Cramer said ""No we're not going to party with Party City. It's way too risky"". So I bought more share :-)"
Just heard a big deal is in play for PRTY....Awesome news. Stocks will soar
"Who keeps selling those shares?...Way oversold...I don't get it....Ignore the shorts and then kids who come on here with BK rumors, there is no such a thing and the company needs to come out with PR to calm the investors."
Party city will get back to the old trading range of $11.00-18.00
"Bought a 1000 shares when this was .50 and it tanked lol. I bought another 1000 shares because I like balloons.Forgot all about it. Up 45% and an additional 4.28% AH. ""Welcome to the party"" they say"
"I’m not sure who got the $1.68 shares. I had a large order waiting at $1.68 and my broker could not fill it. Oh well, I was fortunate enough to get some in the $1.70’s. All of the shares traded today were STEALS. Really a gift at these prices."
"It's heading to 2 easily but my only worry about the earnings, the first quarter the stock was falling"
"Anyone who held during the dip, deserved the pop. PRTY was on the verge of BK. But, with this move, they have bought themselves some more time. I’m now encouraged to take a small long-term position."
The last time it sold off like this is 2016 it went from $6 to $18. And the company is in a lot better position today then it was 3 years go. Plus they sold off the Canadian Stores and will use that money to pay down debt. I also like the 2 new board members they added last week. from Hasbro and Boot Barn.
"Next stop is approximately $12.80. I believe will happen in the coming 1-2 weeks. After that, $16.80. Party’s business is on fire."
"Book to Market 642%. If you know of another company with sales over a billion, with a Book to Market that high, a PE of 1.6 and forward PE of 1.4. let me know."
everyone is so quiet now that Party City is back on the map. All of my longs must have already gotten out. Am I the last one standing????
Could they be divesting the shares prior to a buy out of PRTY so that the individual investors owning those shares can make their own informed decision on when to sell?
"Just remember Halloween wasn’t on last quarters earnings. I talked to a mgr and they had a $17,000.00 day NYE"
This is holding up well and is still in an uptrend. Feels like it's coiling and pressure building to hold it here. I bought 2.55 for a half position again and will sell below 2.35 if it gets to that level. 2k shares for now it's a risk of 400$ loss. I will buy 2k more at 2.45 that's the 50 day and has been my downside target. I posted that over a week ago when I sold 4k at 3.35 with a 2.47 average on those shares.
The store by my house was very busy and had quite a few people inside. I think they were getn ready to PRTY!!!!
"Don’t understand how they can be off estimates, should have been a little more conservative with Q4 guidance. I’d rather underestimate than overestimate.... not like Covid is anything new at this point. Still bullish but annoyed!"
bought a half position at 2.23 yesterday. this is going to fly
TH Lee spent 2.7B in 2012 for 55% share of Party City. They are not selling at these levels folks lol.
What would happen if $PRTY tied the knot with $GME or $AMZN. The retail space would make quite a party.
I think there will be parties all over the world once this virus situation thaws .. the present is dark but the future is bright
New to investing but can't understand why this stock is trading so low! Managed to snag 500 @ 1.88Wish I had more cash to invest.
why would people sell its just about to get good. im still holding
annnd BOOM Goes the Dynamite. like I said: $4.90 target = 90% possible by Black Friday. 100% by christmas. but remember. i did fail Trigonometry in highschool
"Saw the same rhetoric with PCG (with a fire) and that bounced back 40% Day 2. Earnings did not deserve a 67% drop in price. PartyCity stores are not going away, over a billion in revenue does not just disappear. Tomorrow early buyers/ex short sellers will swop in and buy this up. Still ridiculous to drop that much"
"I sold mine at 3.35, should have waited more. anyhow good luck to all Longs."
All this talk of $10 / share is interesting but I’d be happy to see $3..
"Earnings through the roof, and now all stores opening next week, expected to be busy! Stock pickers favorite this next few months!"
"PRTY is the target for a buyout imo - with a low fed rate, any PE would pick it up as it's 100% cash cow (not cash burning tech companies)"
Also you better believe once they announce physical stores REOPENING this is going to fly to $1 +
"This is the exact scenario that catches everyone off guard, and the stock starts to ramp, and FOMO kicks in and the MM's drive the price higher. Very low interest in the stock now until it starts!"
Wondering how this will react if the vaccine gets approved today?
"So it seems like everyone lost interest in this stock....but little do they know.....this party is just going to start. I really dont see this dropping further. As I said before, I am in big enough with 35,000 shares. I sold some off before we dropped, in order to get into YELL....still down but not concerned. This stock is going to be a winner for April. Tomorrow is a new month and we are going to see rebalancing of portfolio's. April starts a new quarter and I see this making up new ground. Get in now before you start thinking its too high."
Cramer said sellGet ready for a rebound
"I see PRTY returning to over $5 per share, in no time. Wholesale and retail. HUGE market share! One quarter does not determine the destiny of large company like this. This is a bargain."
Credit Suisse has an Outperform rating and price target $4 Report from June 2020
"Added another 10k, Private-equity firm THL. Know these boys well. Buy out coming IMO."
Sosin Clifford (10% Beneficial Owner) bought another 1.2 million shares the last two days at $1.76 & $1.85. Bulk of 13 million shares accumulated between $1.6-$2.02 range.
"earnings mid week is odd lol im in tho now enjoy people party citys are back open now atores allowed a certian compacity summer equals people out longer. many wvents juring summer people party for much more then winter,june/july for canada and usa will be big days"
Breaking News!: prty city has developed balloon thruster technology and has beat spce and spaceX to the moon.
"Kind of new to stocks, are you guys still holding? i barely have around 250 shares and just looking to make a couple hundred, a lot of people were saying they will see 4$ but i’m not sure about that. does anyone think it’ll go back up to 2$?"
Good online sales and further announcement of their restructuring should push this over 2.5 post earnings
When does the party start ? 
"i dont even worry about how prty going right now,and it's just the floating that you usually see in the market with person investors. What i am posting this right now to let you guys know at the Q3 it had done great job, and in siders has traded 2.48M at the Q1 2021 that mean somethings. As we see at the Q3 Q4 of the revenues i am confident about prty city in 2021"
The volume tells the tale. Already traded daily avg with 3 hours left.
"PRTY flying nicely under the radar. With the stores opening in June, I think we will see some nice price action soon."
Did anyone see the Initial Statement of Ownership filed? Maybe I’m wrong but looks like someone just bought 10M shares....?
I bought 5k on 1.38 now I scared for long term or short term ?? Is that good price please suggest me thanks
If Party beats next week than the stock may double !!
This is now one of the best deals in the market!
"I work at Party City, curbside pickup started at our store, did about 800.00 day average, then soon as stores opened 1200 Mon to wed, Thursday fri sat went over 4000 each day. I think it's temporary because it's mostly graduation sales and casual birthdays at home. might pick up with summer sales but once we run out of grad balloons sales will stay low until Halloween season starting end of August to November. best time to buy seems to be when the report comes out next week. buy low next week and wait it out until mid October. seems like a long wait, but I think 1stQ report will drop stock to near 20cents per share. can turn 1000 into 5k in a few months"
PC / HC for Halloween is a joke. Spirit is eating their lunch again this season. PRTY will be back under 5 before year end.
"With Y2021 EBITDA around $200M, I think it finally turned it around which reminds me of Michael's (acquired by PE early this year).PartyCity is a long term cash cow play - lots of upside as it didn't start party rental business (chairs/inflatables), cleaning business (before/after party), goodie bag for guests, warehouse/bouncy house."
"JP Morgan just undisclosed they have 670,000 calls and insiders have bought up near 350,000 shares past 2 days. Bullish much here hahaha"
Party stated that June comps were only slightly down vs last year and July was favorable. Balloon strategy seems to be working. Debt restructuring seems successful and liquidity position better. Now they need to figure out how to make Halloween a success ... despite Covid parents will still buy costumes... I know I will be buying them for my kids
Party is booming. If you guys are selling your shares at any price below $20 until Feb of 2021 I am sorry to say you are not investors you are merely penny collectors. Stay Patient and Long. GLTA.
"Well, just visited my local Party City In Chicagoland. Despite all of the Coronavirus hype, people are apparently still celebrating birthdays And also getting ready for St Patrick’s day. People were buying balloons ...traffic seemed good to me."
"How does this board feel about Friday's earnings? today's update that Credit Suisse is maintaining an Outperform on PRTY with a $4 price target, seems to not have trickled up yet. Assuming the past Q1 numbers are bad but that forecasting is positive this could still maintain a steady uptick."
Nov the 20th was the last time so many shares were traded like Friday. Does anyone know why?
"Jump of 33% of total visits on their website. Increase in average visit duration and drop in bounce rate...Except Halloween period, with 4.5M visitors on their website, this is the best numbers they had for a very long time..."
"It has been my experience that sooner or later an investor is going to come and eat these cheap shares up! Party City is trading in an extremely undervalued range. Even at this rate, and big investor is almost guaranteed a 10% annual return on its investment, if it can get in at this level. What an exciting opportunity!"
"Look at a 6 month chart... From February 27th to now, looks like a ""cup"" without the handle formation. Only move is UP!"
"From the Walmart CFO this morning on earnings:Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview with CNBC that customers flocked to stores for items like luggage, party supplies and apparel as they were “coming out of hibernation.” Plus, he said, families have been buying backpacks and items for the classroom."
What I don’t understand is why did the insiders buy some of these shares at much higher prices? It has to be shorted way down.
Some crooks just downgraded the stock which means they are loading up on it before their next upgrade to sell it high. Always do the opposite of what they tell you.
"Everybody is looking for bargains and buying now to prepare for 2020. I spoke to my conservative uncle and he had just bought 65,000 shares of Party City at $2.10. It made me feel good to know people are finding value and buying Party City. Its very possible it can be a $6 - $8 stock before December 2020 or much sooner due to the high short position. I understand why the shorts would still hang in after the big drop, soon they will have to cover !! Good luck to all the longs."
Debt restructuring is ongoing and will help deleverage ... also going to reduce number of outstanding shares
"13.2 million shares off the shelf at $2.88, filed with SEC yesterday."
"I am long and bullish. Entered in mid-March 2020 with large volumes, so I am very happy. But while everybody talks about demand - reopening etc - I am more concerned about supply. Just visited a few stores around Denver where I live, and found the stores pretty depressing, with a lot of shelves empty. They were trying to fill up the store with old items on sale ( Inventory management mentioned by the CEO), but still, the store was looking poorly replenished. I am wondering if they are able to manufature or import products as much as they would like. Increase in raw material costs, increase in shipping costs, difficulties finding workers, all these could lead to a big miss in revenue or a low guidance for next quarters. The new CEO seems to be tackling problems, like debt and inventory, but he also inherited a company not well prepared for such a crisis in their industry. Will see tomorrow. I am cautiously hopeful, but would not be surprised if things are not that great."
"Anyone visited a Party City store recently?I did again last week, checking 5 of them here in Denver area, and I am concerned about the supply. For sure, people were all leaving with balloons, which is highly profitable.But the shelves for everything else are just empty. They have old discounted items on display to fill up the empty spaces, but that does not bring any revenue or margin. They ended up bringing down the Pinata from the highest shelves and the small helium tanks that are usually stocked in the warehouse area.And still, there were huge empty spaces with nothing for sale. The summer items? almost gone... no pool toys, nothing for tiki parties or toga, just a few left over for Luau Parties...I am wondering if they are not too slow in the reopening of the production, or stuck with containers problems, or problems at the ports, or anything else. This could be a major hit and a big miss to their forecast. They better have to be more prepared for Halloween."
"I'm sure a lot of people are going to be wanting to party as things re-open. Also, this was at almost $7 prior to their helium supply issue late last year which they've since addressed. Hopefully, we'll be heading back up toward that price. Either way, I'm feeling really good about my entry at .54. By the way, I originally bought this at the beginning of the year, but as the crash started, I sold before it fell below my cost basis."
"Following up to the last commenter about holding PRTY. It makes total sense. I know TONS of parents (on my apartment block), they all want to throw Graduation parties in the next 3 weeks. As well as graduates from graduate school and med school as well. They aren't hosting parties outdoors for quarantine reasons, so they are buying a metric ton of party stuff online. Some goes to amazon, some goes to party city (more convenient since online u can shop everythign party related). Not to mention, JULY 4th parties are going to come soon, as well as Halloween and Xmas. All of these are going to be hosted INDOORS. The virus will be back by fall/winter - keep this in mind, never forget this.Not to mention......birthday parties. Again in my complex, we have 3 new born births and tons of kids whose bday parties are forced to be indoors (just like the OLD DAYS!). no more chuck-e-cheeses, or pizza bowling parties etc, it's all going to be indoors at home from now on.This stock is a sure PURE winner. But we need time. $1 by year's end for sure (perhaps even before July 4th). and $5 within the next 1-3 years. BECAUSE this ""virus"" aint going anywhere. the vaccine is a race now......but even science cannot rush a 5 year vaccine into 6 months. Also keep in mine there is NO CURE for corona beer viruses.....it's just a ""PATCH"". The world we know it has ended. No more bowling alleys. no more theaters. INDOOR PARTIES FROM NOW ON!"
bought a *(&*(&*( -ton more today. im ready for $5
It will comeback up
"Why is no one talking about the next insider that bought shares?? Clifford Sosin bought 240,000 shares on the 21st. He is a director. A lot of insider buying going on."

Did I goof up buying 1000 shares @ 2.60? I feel like it'll eventually get to that point and higher but I'm probably in for the long run.
"Anyone following this? Huge short position, but this stock is clearly undervalued. Insiders buying stock recently. Short run about to happen?"
I would like to see Weston and other insiders buying at this price level. We need some confidence here that this business can get through the challenging times we are in...
They just mentioned PRTY on the FBN..short mention and she remarked will be buying balloons curbside..great idea!
Insiders continue to buy. Closing bad stores to open in better locations. Getting revenue from stores closing selling their entire inventory. Financials will be good.
"still here in at $.38 and patiently waiting for $20+!!! 40,000 shares "
I really am starting to think that 2.40ish is where we are heading. we dropped on Friday due to less buying not selling pressure. I would think they would try to wipe all the after earnings buyers before heading higher.

"$PRTY is an officially $MEME stocks - look at call option contracts.10,000 call contract at $10 strike, Jan 2022 expiry for $0.80? that's $800K bet someone made."

A vaccine is planned to be offered in December. Should help sales and positive for the last minute Christmas shopping.
Patience will be rewarded here

"On November 12, 2019, funds (the “THL Funds”) affiliated with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.

"The lock up period is ONLY for 6.5 mil shares and not the entire 35 mil shares. Anyway, the selling is done and big block have gone through in the past 2 weeks. This thing is under accumulation and will pop soon once good news come out or whenever MM feels like it. $3 is the next leg up easy.......Down on low volume means manipulation."
Should be back to flat by close. Let's go. Easy money today. Gotta take advantage of these free days. Don't get many
"Hedge Funds are favoring Party City for 2020 and if you look at the Options activity you can see the possible trajectory. Buy and hold you will make money . This could be at $6 - $7 by December 2020, that’s a 200% - 300% !! Good Luck to all the longs."
Terrific quarter.
didn't I tell you guys? go back and read my post. I had confidence in this company.
"Big Money in control of PRTY going forward. Likely slow, small and steady moves for a few more days."
Higher it has to go Vaccine news people are gonna start having more parties and they need supplies
2+ baby...
10 million balloon sales expected 1 day back! WOW!!!
First stock I invested in. Did some research into some other forums. Happy with my outcome. Bought in at $0.99. waiting the long haul on this one
CEO needs to go
"we have pent up demand for large birthday parties, Halloween parties, etc. with delta now falling from peaks, PRTY will return to $10 a share within weeks."
"$PRTY is easily the best trade of the last two quarters so far. ""If you look at Party City’s filings, you’ll see this.

Party City is maintained at outperform by Credit Suisse https://www.benzinga.com/stock/PRTY/ratings
I do give manager alot of credit for averting disaster the past couple of years but fair value is not 17 a share but I do think it is trading near the bottom of it's range...
"Not sure what happened to all of the discussions about how the stock has seen its last days at $2.50 range and how the options were all priced at $2.50/share and that once the expirations hit, the stock was going to move up."
Bought another couple of thousand aftermarket. Once the earnings are settled back to $2.00
Who has held this stock a long time? Why did the price drop drastically like $4.00 overnight last November? It would certainly be nice to see it at $4.00 but I’m doubtful being it was $2.00 last Nov. Could someone please enlighten me? Thanks

The primary reason I got into PRTY was because of all the insiders buying up shares early last fall. Plus Clifford Sossin bought a bunch. Did Clifford make a purchase in the low $6.00 range also? I was thinking he did.
First closing above $1.00 since Nasdaq notification. Good luck Longs!!
What about an option for December. I’m sure it will surpass $3 come Halloween. Plus isn’t this company ONLY open during Halloween season?
"According to Level II order book data, both yesterday and today the sell pressure is a lot less then the buy pressure. Bodes good for the near term it looks like!"
"Thanks to poor earnings, this is one of the cheapest vaccine/recovery plays left."
11 million shares traded hands and was sideways pretty much all day. Consolidating before it goes to $4?
I’m all inBought more todayI think we are going to need a strong message from the company to reverse trend. Maybe a leadership change?
Added another 4500 shares at $2.18
I sold at 3.85. today experiencing a bit of seller's remorse...congratulations to the longs
We're looking at potentially 3 straight says with ~10% gains. Not bad considering today's wishy washy market. Level II order book data currently show a lot more buy pressure then sell's which should bring the price up closer to today's closing.

"I honestly think more people are going to go out and buy Halloween stuff and just do things around the house than trick or treat, maybe spend more and make there own house party with the kids than go out so I see more upside."
"Alot of you are forgetting that the coronavirus will have a huge impact on party city. Most of their vendors are in China and with factory slowdowns, they are in line to lose millions. It's unfortunate, as I had planned on buying back in close to the ER, but I'm now wary as to how this virus will impact the company down the road. Is 1.78 a huge discount? YES, BUT there are a lot of unknowns moving forward, especially with this virus. Be careful."
Shorts will be covering soon
"When insiders buy a ton of shares in an oddball company like this pay attention cause youll make a lot of money the company has to be unique though, look at what happened to KIRK insiders showed the same hunger then that stock went from $2 to $12 then came back down from the highs all im saying is don't be surprised if PRTY goes to $5 by October GLTA"
"This can touch $10 very easily, The company is good situation and has good leadership with good business strategy."
"For all the pessimist's out there look at Cass investment's the guys running this,Clifford Sosin and Lance Ettus have purchased 10 millon + shares the last 3 months. If you look at there track record you will see what these guys are doing is nothing short of Amazing. Not to mention 3 directors have also made purchases of over 240.000 shares. get on the bandwagon now before it's to late."
Company needs to restore confidence. Needs to make leadership changes. Current leadership has decimated shareholder value. We need leadership changes and a couple good quarters to get this stock up
"Everybody who hold this stock should check out the earnings report from Michael's Crafts MIK. They had double digit comp sales compared to LY for the same 13 week period since they reopened. I think you could see something similar with Party City. The Stock had a tremendous run up into earnings, but is down with the rest of market today."
Good day today
"I don't think we can compare today's market landscape with it being much higher in the past. At some point I do believe this will be back to the high's of last year but when that happens nobody knows and anyone who claims they know are full it. I still think it is a great value for the longer term investor. As of writing this Level II market data show low sell pressure and a little higher buy pressure. I still believe this bodes well for the next few days at least. If if positive news is released, watch out above."
elections pretty much done. no idea what to expect Monday but holding thru whatever comes :)

I've got a long way to go to get out of the red on this one but I'll take this increase!
Home Depot says it sold out of an early drop of Halloween decor almost immediately Source CNBC
"Party City: A Specialty Retailer, An Overlevered Balance Sheet, And A Cheap StockPRTY has a startling 12-month stock chart, being down 75% over the course of a year.The equity market is pricing the stock in such a way that implies the business will be gone in short order.We don't view that outcome as likely, and think PRTY makes for a great candidate in a specialty retail basket.With 40% of the float short, the stock trades at ~5x EV/EBTIDA and at a 35% earnings yield.Party City (PRTY) has seen its share price drop by 50% in the past 6 months, 75% in the past 12 months, and is close to 90% off the highs. The stock price has fallen such that the market must be implying impending bankruptcy for the company. While near-term results have been disappointing, we don't share the market's dire outlook. Party City is a specialty retail company with a lot of debt (almost 5x EBITDA). And like most leveraged retailers, the market has not been kind to the company's share price. We believe the narrative that e-commerce will put to bed all brick and mortar stores has been taken too far in the equity market. The narrative that all sales will be done online is an over-simplistic view and lacks nuance. If the company is able to shake off near-term headwinds, we believe the stock could go up 5-fold and still be relatively cheap.The Business - Overview And BackgroundParty City is a dominant player in the party goods industry (costumes, make-up, decorations, candy, etc.). The company has over 900 party superstore locations (which includes 150 franchisees) in North America. During Halloween the company also operates ~250-300 temporary stores under the Halloween City banner. The company's business doesn't need much elaboration other than to note that the company is a specialty retailer; while other retailers may offer similar products, Party City specializes in this specific segment. Further, the industry is extensively fragmented as every major retailer competes in some way in the space.Party City today is the combination of Amscan - which acquired Party City in 2005 - and Party City. Amscan (~25% of sales) is a designer/manufacturer/distributor of party products while Party City (~75% of sales) is a retailer of party products. As seen below, roughly 80% of the company's products offered are sourced internally which gives the company an advantage over peers. Being vertically integrated means the company can more seamlessly shift strategy and respond to consumer demands.(Source: 2018 Presentation)The Market Can't Read TranscriptsWhile the business has clearly run into short-term operational headwinds, that's exactly what they are - short term. We believe the market is misconstruing transient headwinds for a long-term secular decline in the business when in actuality revenue and margins have held up relatively nicely in the past 3 years. Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) revenue and EBIT figures are $2.4 billion and $195 million, respectively. While 2016 figures were $2.28 billion and $274 million, respectively. While these numbers certainly aren't stellar, we believe the market has become far too pessimistic on the company's outlook. Let's discuss why that might be for a minute.Firstly, practically all retailers have seen their share prices hit dramatically in the past couple of years. This is for good reason. Many likely won't make it through this next decade as online and e-commerce are preferable for consumers on many metrics. However, while that's true at one level there's not enough nuance in that view. Meaning, just because online shopping on average is preferable for consumers does not mean all brick and mortar is going away.Conceptually, it is very easy to see why when you give it a moment's thought. Consumers who don't have the luxury of waiting 2 days for their package to arrive have no choice but to stop by a physical store. This is especially so for a retailer specializing in party products. While more general and smaller stores are very likely to get squeezed out of the market in the coming years, specialty stores like Party City are likely to hold their own. We believe this thesis is borne out by the company's financials:(Source: Company)We don't see a company in distress here. We believe the company has a viable business model over the long term. So what about recent results? During the past two quarters, the company found themselves in the unenviable position of having supply chain issues while the broader industry had a relatively weak Halloween sales season. As a result, looking past fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, consolidated revenue was down 1.5% in the most recent quarter. Accordingly, management updated guidance for FY'19 revenue to be down 2%-3% and EBITDA to be down ~15% from prior guidance to $305 million. Given the leverage"

"I just listen to the $PRTY Q1 2020 conference call. I even read the Earnings Transcript too lol. I am so impressed with Brad Westin (the new CEO). No offense to James Harrison (old CEO). But man the competence, the forward thinking, the overall flow and tone of this call is really encouraging. I feel he’s covering all aspects that will lead the company to a bright future. He even talked about accommodating people for having virtual parties! Wow talk about thinking outside the box. Just overall I’m really seeing a great positive future with this management."
"Bottom was hit already, sideways for a while and now the uptrend has begun, will be close to 4 or over by year end. Tax loss selling done, TH Lee poorly managed and the board knows it. Now watch for upcoming PR , but the in stock position for helium is good and comes will show it. The wholesale division will do well representing over 40,000 retailers globally and omni channel shift will ramp up as they become more aggressive their with the learnings from Halloween.It’s all about executing the plan, but the bounce up or the double will come quick then a steady climb. Wouldn’t be surprised if Walmart or Amazon does a buyout due to their breadth of products and manufacturing. A rare opportunity to get in at these levels which will not be seen again. Short covering will make the chart look really pretty with a u pattern. Seen it so many times before. Ready for the ascent through December and onwards. Put high sell limits on you shares so they can’t be borrowed and shorts need to’ cover faster."
"Another insider purchase! 188,500 shares just bought by board member!!"
Been a wild ride I was down almost $30k on this at one point and now I’m up $5k Taking chips off the table
What am I missing here?
"Mr. Vogensen Seems solid. Nice how they snuck in the low comparables with this announcement. But, the valuation is so low now, I would not expect a market reaction to anything. At this rate, the share price will increase, even with bad news. It is soooo oversold."
How many of you agreeing that PRTY price will go up next week ... min $2 by Friday.. Hit like if you agree.
Ouch
I road the wave from $2.80 to $5.25 and am out. Good luck longs. I still see some good upward movement ahead of you.
Seeing a lot of chatter on my screeners for PRTY would not be shocked to see a nice pop this week
hmmm just bought in at $1.35 didn't think it would get filled but took my eye off the ball and it did. I know a lot of people are on this site now ordering things for the delayed graduation parties for late summer so GLTA..
"I work at PRTY in SoCal and every week is busier than the last. I noticed that the floor was dead yesterday (sunday), my coworker laughed and said maybe before, as he inflated balloon order after balloon-order and online order printed after online-order. The Ballon station that they implemented next to the register is REALLY driving sales!!! All while the floor gets a handful of customers...Balloons are their highest profit-margin product, which only reaffirms, to me,that this company is too focused on having expansive retail locations, when they could get away with a small venues, balloon stations, and EXTREMELY comprehensive curb-side, delivery, and e-comm platforms. As well as, focusing on becoming less of a brand and more of a wholesale supplier for everyone. I think it relies on its physical locations to pay off its massive debt, so it can't implement a plan like that on a dime, it's a shipping container, NOT a jet-ski."
"Party is way oversold and undervalued. Debt is manageable at 4-5x EBITDA which is not great but also not horrendous. This is a niche business with relatively high margin. The retail business is challenged but the manufacturing business is healthy and they sell to their competition. IMHO, we should be at least $5"
"I'm excited about Brad as CEO. He really reminds me of Steve Jobs with his vision for Party City. He said that Party City needs to""pivot from a store operations and maintenance culture to a customer engagement and selling culture."" That is EXACTLY on point! I'm willing to give him some time to pursue this AWESOME vision. For those writing Party City off ... you will be disappointed. Even with the tough year last year, there was still positive income made, the debt was paid down, and there is still $35 million in cash on hand, and a $350 million facility available. Trading at around .50 now, this is truly a $10 or more stock ... TODAY! The coronavirus may slow things down for all of us, but I'm encouraged, Party City is in a position to be impressive over the next several years, under Brad's leadership."
I made a trip to Party City today probably 15 shoppers today. They are expecting a busy Halloween this year and they had a table set out with employment applications!
This will rebound. Sorry to the folks who were caught up in margin call selling this afternoon. At all time lows and after a day of margin selling I am sure it will rebound.
Company just posted new slides on their NextGen stores in the investor relations section of their website. Very bullish.
A short run is due. Huge number of shorts. I think they realize they have seen the lows.
2 MILLION BUY BLOCK @$1.80 TODAY AND 800k..... INTERESTING
Hey shorty those 500 I sold for $8.73 the other day I bought them back for $8.32. Holding 4500
Congratulations to all longs. You guys made a good decision to not sell this stock in trouble times and get rewarded. I love you all.
New form 4Another Board member - Conray Grant - bought shares
"I sold my PRTY way too early. Bought in at $0.44 sold at $1.50Never would have thought it would climb this quickly. Congrats to all longs. Just throwing this out there, you may also want to toss a few sheckles into NIO. Unbelievable growth potential and is just in it's infancy. Congrats again!"
Where does everyone see this stock come close to Halloween?
I took profit too only kept a small amount of shares. 4.89 premarket. will be back for round 7 soon :) good luck yall and happy thanksgiving!!!!
My question is why would the CEO and director buy a big chunk ahead if they knew TH Lee was going to sell out?
"I think Louton is the seeking alpha author. Who cares? Last time I checked is if you issue 16 million shares to eliminate $463 million in debt, isn’t that like selling stock at $28.90 when the stock the day the exchange occurred was under $2? They even lowered their overall interest payments by $10 million per year. A lot of value was created with the debt exchange."
This will fly today. Shorts already starting to cover premarket
"There is no doubt that PRTY will expand their model to cover more items like chips, drinks, beer, food, etc going forward. They are competing with grocery as much as WMT or TGT. They have a great niche to allow them to restructure the model. If so, these high turn, high margin items will drive incremental growth. All about how they continue to refinance debt and manage CAPEX."
I was thinking buying PRTY here between $7-8 as a 5 year investment. Thoughts?
should probably see a steady climb after lunch hour. i think we can close $1.50 today.
Is there enough cash flow to make PRTY a $5 stock?
icreasing revenue yoy prty will run $3-4 after decreasing debt 25% positive news this will be upside potential.
52 week high was $7.37. Can we go back to that?
This thing is too cheap. Their non-retail business alone worth much more. It's priced for bankruptcy at this point. Management or an activist should do something. Send out a sign. Do something. C'mon ppl.
Y’all remember how many shares the insiders bought about a year ago with their own money? Hundreds of thousands. They haven’t sold a bit and it’s been longer than 6 months. They’d had dumped them at $11.00 if they believed it was overpriced then.
What is a good buy in price??
Too much debt vs. Revenue and profit. Not to mention tariffs. Sold Canadian stores so revenue will be down some more but cash may be up. Just can’t see $9 PT.
They need to start a share buyback program ASAP
CEO just bought 100K shares
where is everyone today that was so quick to say the sky is falling yesterday? hmmmm
The selling is over. Another leg up from here. On to $20 a share.
who is on this train for the $5.00 per share Station? all aboard
$8.06 right now...I see this company hitting $10 in a few months. Nothing else can beat what they are offering in the USA. All one stop shop with competitive pricing and transaction convenience...
CAS partners just bought another traunch of shares... two purchases announced in past two weeks
"From the company website:""Reopening stores: We’re excited to announce that as of May 1st, we’ll begin reopening stores in areas the government permits. However, we’re dedicated to your safety and taking the necessary precautions to keep everyone safe. """
We will be in the green today. Classic shaking of the trees to get stock by the sharks
"Insider trading, 10% stake holder SOSIN CLIFFORD just made a purchase of stocks worth $6,399,840 at $3.9999 !! Who's in for the parrtyy !!!"
"Just purchase a lot of this. I'm not expecting this stock to fly back, but I'm long game"
"I think that PRTY, GME are M&A targets for mega tech companies:- both companies are offering products that customers rarely plan ahead to buy (impulsive/price inelastic)- specialty stores with long shelf life (not food)- consistent profitability with flat revenue (cash cow)- house brands (no need to spend money on marketing)- as long as disney/universal/xbox/ps/nintendo and hollywood movie producers keep launching different icons/themes, both companies will be carrying products that are sold well.Some people may concern about Amazon but PartyCity is the largest vendor among Amazon sellers so it is making more money by selling its products online."
Also great analysis of our current situation. Notice the mega increase of ownership from institutional investors. https://www.uspostnews.com/2020/05/04/is-party-city-holdco-inc-prty-dependable-investment-for-investors/
"CEO of Party City Holdco Inc (30-Year Financial, Insider Trades) James M Harrison (insider trades) bought 125,000 shares of PRTY on 08/12/2019 at an average price of $4.53 a share. The total cost of this purchase was $566,250."
"I'm seeing a lot of reactions to the share price. With a company this levered, this volatility is not abnormal. Guided '19 EBITDA decreased $48mm. At a 6x EV/EBITDA multiple, a drop in share price of ~$3.7 was warranted."
Anyone else was holding since March at .40 cents and sold at 3 dollars knows the pain I’m feeling
I am a current stock holder BUT... Went to a local PartyCity store today and actually talked to the store manager. 1st of all -Store looked cheap - they were still taking down the Halloween items!! Minimal Xmas items stocked. AND the Xmas items were OVER-priced ($25 for a nice looking Xmas wreath - but much cheaper elsewhere) and they only have sales AFTER Xmas. As opposed to Hobby Lobby that does a MAJOR Xmas sale pre-holiday (I spent a couple hundred dollars worth with them last year). Store Manager was lamenting about 2 main things - international shortages of helium which is a large part of their business and NO workers - very very short staffed...oh and added that no one buys full Halloween costumes anymore! (haha). I bought a couple halloween items there last month and loved their selection and thought prices were OK. BUT right NOW -they NEED to change their business model - just NOT working. And this store is in a middle to upper class customer area. So ? - Is it better to over charge and NOT sell something or cut your profit some and sell 3 of them? This company needs an ACTIVIST to give them a Fricking CLUE! Under water on my shares and have really been considering averaging down so that's why I stopped in today but - errrgg!! Thoughtful comments appreciated from the YF board.
"Glad to see the latest Short article posted by a Seeking Alpha poster had little effect. He estimates worth between .95 and 3.75. Talks about ""continued helium shortage"". As a major helium supplier to the Balloon Industry (Dollar Tree, etc.) ... there is no shortage of helium for the US market as several large independent wells have increased availability both here and in Canada."
"They have a great CEO with a new vision that will put Party back on the map. Corona hit hard just after commencement of the new plan roll out. 1.More eye appealing stores. 2.Islands instead of endless rows. 3. Balloon point of sale to speed up general merchandise sales. 4. PARTY PLANNERS to assist customers and drive sales. 5. Updating current inventory to reflect current customer needs and trends. Most importantly making the transition from a sales oriented store to a customer first based environment. With these changes Party will no doubt be a powerfull player in this arena going forward and one of the great survivor stories of this Pandemic. Hold long and strong. ""Welcome to the Party"""
I looooooove this stock!!!
Zacks just posted their party city unusual option activity so you know Thomas H Lee’s buddy’s know the short is on.
"All longs should place a sell order over $4.00 and keep walking it up as the trend reverses. By placing a sell, your shares can’t be borrowed and if everyone does, the short squeeze will start and the move will be swift to the upside once it does. They have the right head merchant in place now to streamline assortment like tablecloths from 32 sku’s to 20 without sacrificing sales, which will help with better merchandising of add on products and freeing up shelf space and merchandise dollars to expand hot categories or test new ones. They are doing all of the right things with Bopis from Amazon marketplace and the possibilities are endless to add assortment online and drive footsteps into the store and create opportunities for additional sales on pick-up.Management seems to know what they need to do and are talking to customers to get feedback at a granular level versus others that show hubris thinking they know it all. We are well positioned to surprise on next earnings and reach new highs next year. The market will continue to get that helium is back, and their partners at wholesale level will also start to get back in stock driving sales through that channel. Canadian tire is already forecasting doubling purchasing of consumer goods through the wholesale arm. More big customers will be added.We are also a buy-out candidate from the likes of Walmart or even Amazon as the purchase of whole foods would lead to making this a much better deal in terms of prospects. Tax loss selling has been done early and big boys will be and are loading up. They are focused on costs and improvements in margins and this is one of the times where you can get your hands on an easy 5 bagger plus in a year or much more. Triple in less than six months."
"Party City EPS misses by $0.06, revenue in-line"
I personally think PRTY is flooding the market with shares to the tune of about 15 million. I saw the outstanding shares go from about 95m to over 110m. Once those shares are scooped up we are headed to over $5.
"Your money is fine stop selling. I bought most of my shares at $0.38, it shortly after climbed to $0.75 and then fell back to $0.48 before reaching $1.30 less than 2 weeks later. It will go back up just be patient."
Stay the course longs... we went from $1.95 to $2.58 in just two weeks. We might see a pullback to $2.35 but don’t panic it’s good to solidify the base going up.
Earnings will triple day of reopening tues June 2. My 2 local stores are all decked out!
Party city insiders has bought 2.48M shares at Q1 2021

"what is going on, why the massive drop on no negative news...?"
"Quarterly report is still a ways off and out of catalysts the stock simply doesn't present a good value at it's current so it had a big run its exhausted I don't see it tanking definitely see a light pullback in the trading range until it can show sustainable, profitable earnings going forward this next ER is huge"
What a great day. Think when people actually catch on to party city stock and you tubers start making more videos. This will go back to 10 per share.
Huge volume today. Might be able to hit $1 tomorrow.
"Party City is hiring 17.000 employee's, yes as I mentioned earlier the store near me was very busy."
"Bout 35000 shares yesterday starting at 2.40 then averaged down. I normally buy half first then 25% times two if it keeps dropping but I went “almost all in” expecting the bounce. Also trading kicked in and day traders kept flipping in and out and I was not surprised it kept selling off into the close. I would have bought another 35000, but couldn’t do it because margin rules didn’t apply due to the price. I am super excited with my position and I see 5 plus in the near future.we will all be making money folks..."
"Party City now expects 2019 revenue in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.38 billion, down from $2.40 billion to $2.45 billion it forecast earlier.Harrison said annual results would also include an impact from helium shortages, higher freight and distribution costs.Party City cut its full-year earnings forecast to 84 cents to 91 cents per share, much lower than its prior range of $1.26 to $1.36 per share. I'm in. GLTA"
"Not sure about the calls and do not trade in that venue and the Market Makers...hey might be right. When I look at a company I make sure I know something about the business. Bunch of folks that probably do not know the party biz have made some good bucks here. Especially the big buyers when it was in change. The way I see it, as opposed to this post, is Q3 WILL be bad. Summer is never good in the biz. If you are waiting for a good report I suspect not. This whole thing depends on Halloween. If that does not go well, the stock will run up on anticipation prior to Halloween and sink. Not sure what will happen. If I knew, I would spend a mint and collect. If you see huge sales at Walmart and other big retailers short of Halloween, that might be a sign. I wish you all well on this investment."
Sold at 4.92 based on a gut feeling. Cost at 1.71. GLTA who stayed in!
"8.00+ stock all day long and make no mistake, it will get there."
Now on the way to 13 trading days above $1.00. Good luck Longs.
Another Large Insider Buys ..10% ownershiphttps://twitter.com/Scottw5876/status/1240820926670942208/photo/1https://twitter.com/Scottw5876/status/1240822634989879299/photo/1
What are our plans for this Friday's reports?
"Up today i have 6900 shares @ 1.30 average, longs let's hold until we 3x minimum. Party City is the best I see lots of little stands where they sell stuff in different unrelated commerces like general stores around my home in Québec, Canada."
CEO purchased on 8/12/19 for $4.53. It will easily get back to that level.
"This won't break $3 until Oct 19. Reason being is that the OI on OTM Oct 16 calls is 18,000... MMs are going to hold this down so they profit all that premium. With no catalyst between now and Oct 16, and with a mkt cap of $280MM, it won't be that hard for MMs to suppress. Welcome to the world of micro-cap stocks. MMs run the show. Starting Oct 19, this will begin a run up to $3.6-4 by Nov 5. Then we'll see how the quarterly report goes. If the report is bullish, as I expect, then I think we'll see the gap fill up to $6-7 by Nov 13."
"I am holding since since $0.45, I have faith in the business and leadership it will emerge as a strong business in near future. certain conditions will make the SP spike. the stimulus package after the election and any therapeutic or vaccine for covid19 will help spike the price. GLTA Longs"
"Bought 5000 shares at $0.38 back at the first COVID drop. We struggled to hang on a few times there, but I can't believe how incredible this ride has been!! I might be done. Any thoughts on where this might go from here? Should I take my profit and run?"
Nice Cup and Handle pattern on daily Chart. We Broke the Handle Resistance wich means we could hit 3.33$ soon and if we are able to fill the gap we could go to 5.25$ !
From Simply WallstreetShare Price vs. Fair Value60.9% UndervaluedCurrent Price $6.76 - Fair Value $17.28Below Fair Value: PRTY ($6.76) is trading below our estimate of fair value ($17.28)Significantly Below Fair Value: PRTY is trading below fair value by more than 20%.
Party is already gearing up for Halloween. I did take 500 shares off but have a $1.34 avg for 4000 shares
something to think about:- stock tanked due to a poor earning- stock tanked further as its major shareholder (private equity firm) announced distribution to its another funds aka vehicles- CEO bought $232k worth of stocks- one director bought $60k worth of stocks- another director bought $500k worth of stocksdidn't we see this from other companies like GE in this August?- GE announced its earning not meeting the expectation- street questioned GE about its pension aka contingent liabilities- whistle blower put out an article that GE had no value and regulators must audit them- CEO bought $2m worth of stocks- one director bought $280k worth of stocks- another director bought $85k worth of stocks- SVP of the company bought $1m worth of stocks result on GE? the stock price went up by 50%sometimes the market is not efficient than the insiders.
"I love how shorts will say sell it’s going to $1.50. Answer this intelligent shorty.Why was 500,000 shares just purchased at $2.00 by an insider?"
could anybody explain the reason for the trend over the past few trading days?
"Technical analysis::: “A buy signal was issued from a pivot bottom point on Tuesday December 17, 2019, which indicates further gains until a new top pivot has been found. Volume is rising along with the price. This is considered to be a good technical signal.”"
Holding up very well today. Could move past $2.90 if there is any good news from Congress and the market goes green.
PRTY has been around for over 80 years. They will weather this storm and get Wall Street respect back. People love these stores during the holidays and Wall Street is expecting a YUGE Christmas. Get the shares now while on clearance price.
"Party City Director just picked up another 4000 shares! Now he has over 80,000 shares!"
"Party city is considering partnering up with another company possibly in Canada, which could be the possible reason why board members are mass buying. This could be announced on November 5th, along with the earnings."
Party City has new TV ads featuring Margaritta theme plus others. Coupons coming out in papers and online Sunday. Shorts are trying...but they will lose on a huge squeeze Friday and Monday and Tuesday. 3 days of huge gains!
today for 1 dollar?
"Looks like that’s about all she wrote for today, definitely was nice seeing a pop over 2.00 though, even if it was only momentarily. Looking forward to seeing it consistently above $2 next week"
"This is exactly what the $2 Trillion dollar government package is supposed to avoid ... companies getting pushed over due to the Coronavirus. Party City has to qualify for millions in grants or government loans! There are THOUSANDS of jobs on the line here. The US should not let a good company go down. With the current low interest rates, bond holders and investors should also be willing to rework things and restructure, short of chapter 11. This is very disturbing but I’m hopeful for the best."
i think the MMs are shaking down the people who got in for quick profits before a short squeeze. cant help but add on discounted share prices like this. long and strong :)
"Reported 3 new insider trades to the SEC 166,415 shares acquired by Thompson Sean78,313 shares acquired by Vogensen Todd E. (Chief Financial Officer) 33,885 shares acquired by Kulikowsky Denise (Chief Human Resources Officer)"
Started to move..approached 2.45
"Regardless of the timing of the sale of share by this insider and many do for personal reasons, PPS is way undervalued and P/E is 1.7......Shrot term bounce is a no brainer."
How could sales only decrase by 20% with stores closed most of the quarter?
Great day to come out with good earnings
"Buy, buy, buy. This free money"
"I might be off by a little bit plus minus 10-30 cents, but considering a short squeeze is certainly coming very soon and if the daily trend continues this might hit $2.90+ by Thursday."
"Bought 300,000 shares @ .26 cents.... Sold today @ $1.84"
"This os a weak earnings report yes but a 70% crush on over a billion in revenues, thats crazy. This should run back tomorrow towards $3 quickly. I am all in at avg. price of $2.56 will be sitting tight and watching it rise."
I don't get it ... why is this tanking with the results they had ?
Are there any predictions for tomorrows call ?
Another great finish in green longs! Hope we finish the week strong and start even stronger next week!
Seeking alpha article. What an absolute con to make people sell their shares. More than likely the stock will tank today because of it. What a joke
"I used to rent helium tanks from my local Party Store.... then I'd buy hundreds of small, medium, large, giant, and 4 foot diameter balloons... ribbons.... the plastic discs to close the balloons.... The entire house was filled with balloons for birthday parties.... Near the end of the party, we'd attach messages to the balloons and let them fly...."
"Does anyone remember what happened in 3Q20? Numbers were not that bad, and now they forecast 3Q21 lower than 3Q20 in rev and profit. Strange...Hard to understand... Over cautious., or a one-time event in 3Q20?Now, it will take outstanding numbers for Q3 and huge Halloween sales to be back to $10+...Worth the wait but painful"
"Wow, I have heard of a sell off before, but down 65%? What is REALLY causing that?"
"I work next door to a Party City store. Graduation time, balloon sales are booming. No shortage here in this store in IL. BUY, OVERSOLD!"
Where does everyone see the price of this stock exactly 1 year from today?Thinking about investing into this stock and holding for a year or two.What's everyone's thoughts?Thanks!
"I briefly looked at the finanancial statements. If it wasn't for the significant impairment loss, the financial statements and sales look good to me. Investors need to learn how to read the financial statements. The impairment loss is because of the drop in Stock price...should not have caused such a sell off."
hey PARTY PEOPLE! PRTY looking really good. we past this resistance. the next Target is $4.05 then $4.99. see u there! in the winner's circle! :)
"yes sir been here since .38 with 40,000 shares and I'm staying until we hit the 20s "
"did anyone notice someone bought over 2m shares end day, and someone bought quarter million toward end day over each of the past few days, or am I just seeing things? I have been stuck with this stock with significant loss for a while now, hoping it will go back up to the 4s. thumb up if you think it will before feb 2020!"
Clifford had to have known the financial situation of PRTY when he bought those last shares a few weeks ago. I sold off yesterday and bought back half at $6.90. Prty has been good to me.
"Party City Holdco Inc.'s (NYSE:PRTY) 57% decline over the past year could present a recovery opportunity for investors.The party supplies retailer is making changes to its store estate, while its international growth plans could contribute to its successful financial turnaround.￼Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PRTY. Click here to check it out.PRTY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PRTYPeter Lynch Chart of PRTYInternational opportunitiesThe company's sale of its Canadian retail assets in August to Canadian Tire could strengthen its financial outlook. Party City will utilize the proceeds from the transaction to reduce its leverage, which could improve its competitive position and reduce its overall risk from an investment perspective.In addition, the deal includes a supply agreement between Party City's manufacturing business, Amscan, and Canadian Tire. It has an initial term of 10 years and could benefit from Canadian Tires' plans to double sales across Party City locations in Canada over the next two years. This appears to be a realistic goal since over 90% of the country's population is within a 15-minute drive of a Party City store.The deal is similar to the franchise relationships that Party City has in Mexico, as well as its European and Australian retail agreements. It forms part of its international growth strategy, which could diversify its business and boost its growth rate.Store changesThe company opened three new smaller format concept stores in the second quarter. They are between 7,000 and 10,000 square foot test stores that offer unique assortments of the company's products in smaller markets that may not require one of its larger stores.Party City's smaller stores require 30% less inventory than its larger stores, but it expects them to deliver 90% of its larger stores' sales, according to its second-quarter update. This should equate to an improved return on investment for the business, as well as more time for employees to interact with customers. This could improve the company's customer conversion rates and boost its sales performance.The company closed 34 U.S. stores in the first half of 2019 as part of its strategy to close underperforming locations, reporting that its sales recapture rates from customers of closed stores were in line with its expectations. This could mean additional store closures could have a positive impact on its bottom line.Potential risksParty City's second-quarter sales and earnings figures were below its internal expectations. They were negatively impacted by a helium shortage across many of its markets, which caused the company's comparative sales to decline 2.1% in the second quarter.In addition, the business could be negatively impacted by ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Its total annual purchases from China are around $150 million and are subject to tariffs. This could lead to Party City increasing its prices or accepting lower margins over the medium term, which may hurt its financial outlook.The company reported in its second-quarter results that it is making progress in procuring sufficient helium to satisfy customer demand. For example, it entered into an agreement that provides the business with 35% of its average monthly demand of helium.In response to the threat of tariffs on imports from China, the business is developing its manufacturing capabilities in other countries. For example, during the quarter, it concluded the final shipment of products from a new joint venture with one of its suppliers in Cambodia. This may gradually reduce its dependence on China, though in its quarterly update the company said it estimates the potential impact on its bottom line from existing tariffs will be less than $2 million in the current fiscal year.OutlookParty City is forecasted to post a 16% increase in earnings per share next year. Since it trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 5, its valuation suggests it has investment appeal.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned.Read more here:"

Easy ride back to $4 by spring. Analysts are expecting a huge holiday season this year. Party is well positioned.

The 29,662,256 shares distributed to the limited partners does not have a lockup period so they could have already been sold at their discretion. Maybe this was the major cause for the 11/13 drop (8.5 million trading volume)? This is the SEC filing: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1592058/000119312519290608/d827598d8k.htm When does the 15 trading day lock-up end for the general partner? 11/27? I want to go in but maybe wait until the 15 day lock-up. Thoughts?"
besides the HUGE institutional buyers....... guys just LOOK at that giant GAP around $5.00. a 3 year old would tell you this is a technical buy!
"In Nov 2019, their share price fell due to the Helium gas issue, which they have now resolved."
Party City Holdco is up 30.90% to 0.68
"CoStar Article: “Party City Plans 20 ‘Next-Gen’ Stores in First Quarter.” Party City is going to see some great growth here and they recently noted that they plan to further improve and expand its omnichannel capabilities, offering curbside pickup, “buy online, pick up in-store,” or BOPIS, and helium balloon delivery. The next-gen stores are going to create major efficiency for Party City. I feel that these next-gen stores that are currently being built are not being talked about enough. This is huge for party city especially since the costume market was valued at $32.9 billion in 2019 and is estimated to reach $59.7 billion by 2027 and their market cap is under $650 million. Within a year when we start to see the benefits of these stores I am expecting to see the market cap push $2 billion or $17.5 a share. Just for disclosure, I bought my large position yesterday and I’m going to hold for around a year or two depending on how fast this stock rallies."
long and strong with 6 truck loads of shares :) Let's go!!
"Holy shnikes!! Book Value to Market Price to Book Value is almost exactly 1:2 ratio. Historical ratio for Dept. & Discount Retail Store Industry has been 4.30... In conclusion, according to historical numbers this stock should be up as much as 780% from Friday's closing price of $5.68. On top of that, PRTY is a supplier for Amazon's party retail goods... I am 100% long PRTY position here! I think it goes to $9-$10 by March 2020."
Holding 3000 shares all on the house plus some. Not much compared to a lot of you but not shabby either.
"""In the second quarter, we expect our consolidated sales to be approximately $475 million to $490 million, with the brand comp sales increase in the 92% to 97% range versus the comparable 13-week period in 2020 or a mid- to high single-digit increase versus the comparable period in 2019. Lastly, we expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million."""
New insider purchase Board member just filed 4 (Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership) SEC Filing showing he just bought 250k shares at $2.00 each
"Please stay sub-7 for one more day. I have some cash available to deploy tomorrow. Already added some at 6.71, but a little greed is causing me to want to add more."
"Tomorrow we will break the $2.50... from there we go to $3.00. I think this will happen by next Friday. Should have bought 50,000 shares instead of 30,000 at $2.10. Might add more tomorrow. Stay the course longs the shorts are scared ."
I just read my previous post and bought another 1000 shares lol. Guess I talked myself into it.
Looking at a long period chart gives you a hint of a U shaped recovery. I don’t mind if it hits 3$ and rebounds down. I’ll hold because future events is in our favor.
Monday morning can’t get here soon enough. If they barely miss earnings and it drops 20% I know what to do I buy more.
I'm buying myself and all my long friends a party hat for my birthday mid October :)
The Party City store where I live was really busy yesterday with a lot of people in line waiting to be checked out. This is right before Labor day and I believe that this is a good sign for Party City. IMO
CAS Investment Partners upped it stake in PRTY. They own a big chunk as well.
"We're seeing an earlier then normal profit taking albeit relatively small one, on the sharp upwards market bounce. Level II open book order are fairly even as of writing this. Some large pending sales at $1.72/73. Large buy's at $1.61. Should end the day at least 10% up like the 3 last trading days."
"So much selling pressure today, it gave away all the gains/bounce from yesterday. The fear of more share distribution is the only thing driving the stock down."
"I have made a lot of money in the market as a pattern trader. I was initially going to jump in and out of this stock; however, after doing some research, I’ve decided to go long with it. There are some of us that will get wealthy from this wonderful and soon to be prosperous company. I salute each and every one of you."
