I can’t explain it. This will also be one of the top holdings in Cathie’s ARKX/Space ETF. Still cheap. 100+ by eoy is possible. I am expecting a beat and healthy forward guidance.
Trimble reached an all time high at 74.76
"As of 4/6/21, ARK Invest owns a total of nearly 4 million shares of TRMB in their funds. The largest holding is in ARKQ, it is also the 2nd largest holding (after TSLA) in that fund:ARKQ 2427400ARKX 594960ARKK 473256PRNT 360318Total 3855934"
A 15% profit margin - it's a good margin but I would expect higher for what is essentially a subscription based service.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Rightpicker.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Massive issues Dayton, OH fulfillment center!MFG management failing"
"ARFC management is a laugh as well as VP of OPS, Leah Lambertson. Do believe they know best. Treat people poorly. Make us work long day’s, if you don’t do they walk you out.Philipp Bench making $135K and 15% bonus on top p/yr, us making a sad $15 p/hr.Shipping lithium batteries but not following regulations. Daniel Schouse, don’t get me started, thinks has export-import knowledge hahahaha.Debbie Frost rapidly moved to new position before being fired. Good for her to be close with Valerie Large who saved her.Great company but poor management in Dayton, incl. Sunnyvale senior mgt."

Trimble reached an all time high at 75.67
TRMB reached a 52 Week low at $30.81
buy order at 79!!!
"As Majida posted a few days ago, this stock could be overvalued at these levels. Remember, easy come, easy go."
"The inclusion of TRMB into the S&P 500 is a huge validation of its business model transformation over the past five years. Many Wall Street analysts missed this infrastructure story and stood on the sidelines while the stock tripled. Now we're in the big leagues - an important designation for a relatively small, under the radar company"
This company will do well with the new infrastructure plan coming out this week !! ￼
"Their deferred revenue was up over $300M from 1Q 2018, and the tax rate was 20%, compared to 17% in 1Q 2018. That makes things a little better."
#$%$ analyst doesn?t know Jack squat
Eleven in.sight transportation news releases from the Houston expo this morning --- got to be a record.
"Trimble paid $450 Mil for Tekla, yet if you call and try to get prices break down of their Tekla product all I can say good luck with that. I'm in new jersey have been trying for almost week talking to this guy named Timothy Castillo; he is an account manager for North East. how are they supposed to sale it if potential buyer can't get any information on prices."
Not a good outlook. Where's the revenue growth after all the press releases?
"ARKQ bought another 112,972 shares today. I can’t believe this gem hasn’t caught the eye of more analysts, but their silence also means institutions are quietly accumulating. TRMB is perfecting land management, mapping, planning, planting, growing, harvesting, transport, processing.. to say this is being slept on is an understatement."
"P/s is rising fast but the valuation isn't too rich here yet.. think what you want about ARK, plenty of other institutional backing. Still need to see a strong guidance/ ER"
Congrats to this basically empty board. All-time high heading into earnings.
"There was talk at PDAC that Trimble might take over Agjunction. Being a shareholder in AJX, sure hope this is so. For $60 million this would be a cheap, quickly accretive acquisition I should think."
Trimble reached an all time high at 62.61
"$42.3 ... Good, good, good!"
"ARF struggling staffing. 3rd shift not taking off, semi-automation isn’t working as planned. Leah/Philipp failing.Very very concerning considering volume increase / heavy backlog"
TRMB reached a new 52 Week Low at 32.66
Going to buy more shares on this dip! :)

TRMB is down -4.94% to 37.40
"TRMB’s earnings call went well, I’m assuming expectations of high interest rates are dragging it down. When should we expect an upside?"
Goldman downgrade does not seem to be holding. Hope we move higher....
"Facial recognition temperature scanners aren’t sufficient Philipp Bench. Dangerous COVID-19 environment ARFC Dayton, OH"
Mr Wonderful likes this one. Time to buy.
Goldman has some splaining to do to their clients who sold TRMB based on their ill-timed advice.I got a hunch JPM is working on its upgrade report as we speak
"The earnings report offered nothing to get excited about, unless I missed something. Can someone steer me to growth?"
"Institutional buying every morning like clockwork. Hopefully another strong ER can lead to some upgrades. Probably not undervalued at 90, but definitely underappreciated. I like the moves they have been making, starting the venture fund, partnering with Boston Dynamics.. etc. Long term hold and a strong future."
"ARKX is now a $344 million fund and growing, they just added 380k shares of TRMB last Thursday. BTW, the stock is also the 3rd largest holding of ARKQ fund."
It just seemed like everybody was so dang depressed over everything at the company. I really wanted to be happy but it seemed like I was a target if I showed any enthusiasm whatsoever! I think it came from upper management down and there was no fix in sight.
Someone doesn't want me posting anything positive about TRMB on this board as they keep getting deleted
"ARKK today bought 760,613 shares!"
"TRMB is a dynamic company into field of autonomous driving, infrastructure construction, data analytics etc. However this message board is very quiet saying that not too many people are interested in this company. I am surprised."
Trimble Teams with ROBORACE for its Autonomous Racing Series Trimble Named Official GNSS-Inertial Positioning Technology Supplier
"The momentum junkies who chase new-fangled, cool sounding companies have over-looked this gem of a company selling at only 5X EV/Sales. Meanwhile - up over 70% the last 12 months"
"OSHA OSHA need to check in at the Dayton Fulfillment Center. Philipp Bench creating mess, very limited social/physical distancing going on"
TRMB is down 4.95% to $36.29
This will hit $100 after infrastructure bill passes! ARK knows what they are doing.
This company is being slept on hardcore. Compared to the absurd prices for recent IPOs and other meme stocks. Once Hololens 2 sales really pick up. Trimble is set to explode in the next few years.
Will the results boost the share price? Will there be an upgrade by analysts?
Trimble reached an all time high at 64.78

like the price action....headed higher...
but guides at the high end for next quarter ;-)....
We were right. The stock was overvalued. (I should have sold but I was greedy and hoping for more.)
Philipp Bench ARFC $136K per annum +15% MIP.Us making $15 an hour and facing COVID!
Our customers won't be patient. Many are already calling & we have to be caught by the end of Saturday at the very latest. We only fell further behind Monday & Tuesday. Based on what I see we have to plan 2 8-10 hr shifts for Saturday with extra help from packout people. We are just going to slowly in shipping. Leah
https://t.co/vhnmWddctO Very bullish for $INSG $MIXT $PNTR $CAMP $ORBC $TRMB Tom Toms Telematics business will do approximately 135M SAAS and 35M hardware in 2018 so assuming Hardware was sold at a 1X multiple you get 6.5X for the SAAS biz. $VZ bought FLTX at an 8x multiple.

"This stock is a winner . On a pull back, I buy more . I am heavily weighted in this company so I follow it every day. I haven’t heard about shipping or labor problems etc . This company is growing fast which can be good and challenging at the same time but seems like management is handling it well . If anyone hears any updates on the company, please post . We’re in for the long haul .$CELH $SIG $A $TRMB"
"With Q-end approaching they’re running short on material, can’t keep up in ARF due to staff turnover.Very concerning"
"Steadily growing EBIT, good margins, applications across multiple industries, low float, reasonable p/e, #3 holding in ARKQ and top holders are BLK/VOO - I’m buying, better late than never."
"Money transfers from the impatient to the patientWhy would anybody have sold in recent weeks given the strong fundamentals? Listen to the fundamentals, not the tape!"
TRMB is down -4.94% to 38.53
I have followed this stock for nearly 20 years and used to own some. Congrats everyone who was more patient than me.
"Hello?? Anybody here?? Institutional buying day after day, right at 9:30am... Institutional Owners: 1199 total, 1174 long, 12 short Aug. 19, 2021 Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $750 million in repurchases of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and replaces the prior 2017 authorization of $600 million, of which $50.7 million was remaining and has been cancelled."
time to sell
"There supposed to be lots of buying because of inclusion into SP500 today. However, I am not seeing it."
Another solid quarter. We should see north of $40 again soon
TRMB is a great infrastructure play and the top holding of the ARKX ETF. JMHO
what a monster stock. I'm in for long term investment!
"~22% turnover in temps!!Imagine all the DG training records, if any!"
Looks like e-Builder has developed a bunch of API's for linking up outside programs.This comes right after Trimble acquired them. Good acquisition timing.
"Berglund's salary was just increased 25% to $1 million per year. Dear Mr. Berglund, on behalf of your shareholders I'd like to let you know you certainly don't deserve a raise."
"There was some insider buying today after a week+ of consolidation. Coincidence? Either way, tons of institutional control here, probably won't see crazy movement. I want to hold through earnings see what their guidance and research/plans look like."
TRMB soars to new all-time high. It pays to do your own research and conduct proper security analysisDon't you wish you had an analyst like me on your team?
Earnings are on Wednesday so let see
institutional holding 98% of TRMB shares....
TRMB is up 5.19% to 37.07
"The inclusion into SP500, not only not stimulate price increase, it actually went down. Can't believe it.Can someone explain his to me?"
Hopefully this company will become a little more visible- they are solid and under appreciated. 50 coming soon
"AG season has started, with Geospatial, building & construction season approaching wondering how much COVID-19 impacts revenue.Geospatial division down 10 percent in 2019 already! OPS division facing major challenges in particular the ARFC. (Temp) labor, temp agency, attendance, huge labor turnover. Q2 interesting to watch closely"
"attendance policy revised for Dayton, OH fulfillment center. People stopped showing up due to high risk of infection despite extra compensation offered"
I love this company and it’s primed for a big future
"Inclusion into the S&P500, ARK Invest consistently purchasing more shares everyday, solid financials and healthy balance sheet... this is a solid long term hold"
Hitachi to acquire TRMB competitor GlobalLogic for $9.6 billion.
Long term supervisors in ARF making $55-$60K max. New hires $65-$70K. Female much less vs. male
Huge buy at 4:00PM... hello Cathie Wood :-)
Capx will get slashed short term. Most CEO’ S waiting for direction of Coronavirus impact and supply chain disruption. TRMB may have orders on the books but they may get canceled.
Amazing results! Thank you TRMB- solid with smokin guidance as well!
As someone who works as a GIS analyst I see first hand the growing demand of geospatial analysis in many sectors Across N.A. As long as Trimble can handle this rapid growth I believe this stock will continue to outperform
"Cathie Wood run up the price by buying and now she's taking her profits and running the price down.When I was young, we referred to a young lady acting like that as being a ""chippy."""
ARKX number 1 holding !!!!!
TRMB reached a 52 Week low at $30.01

What affiliation does SiriusXM have on this?

"Many months later still chaos.ARF struggling staffing. 3rd shift not taking off, semi-automation isn’t working as planned. Very very concerning considering volume increase / heavy backlog /"
Not a very good earnings number. Twenty-five cents?
TRMB crossed its 50-day MA few days ago. Bullish signal. Looking good coming up to next earnings report.
"Dayton fulfillment center management instructed by Sunnyvale OPS management: do not ship all orders this quarter, push to next quarter. Don’t need revenue this Q but need good start next Q ....."
Trimble reached an all time high at 60.94
Beat earnings and guided higher. What the fudge it went down for? This should have been up 10%.
Major beneficiary of the infrastructure bill. All those projects have to be engineered before they begin. This is what Trimble does. The transportation division not so bad either.
This is a company with solid and growing earnings. Highly unusual for it to be the #1 holding in an ARK ETF!
Results were excellent really.. this is a fantastic company touching on multiple sectors. High conviction hold for ARK. And I love that they started a $200M venture fund.. that’s building a nest egg for the future.
OT OT OT OT ..... for what?Management MIP bonus
"We're a taciturn bunch on this site, so I'm not going to say anything."
Can’t find people to work for them in the ARF Dayton. Turnover of 20%+
it will go down $35 !! This week
"Piper initiated coverage today with an overweight rating and $101 price target. Aside from the silly false precision price target, the report is very good and should put to rest the ignorant bear argument peddled by hack analysts and buyside managers too lazy to understand the story but instead rely on charts"
"Down for 3 weeks.. Oppenheimer just revised guidance upward to $0.61 EPS.. Morgan Stanley raised target to $70 (equal-weight.. sure) and Goldman Sachs has an $84 buy.. and we've got Jerry here making some weird, vague comments about working at the company. Why are you so bitter? Can you talk about something meaningful?"
"This is a nice 3d builder app stock, also the gps, This is very special."
