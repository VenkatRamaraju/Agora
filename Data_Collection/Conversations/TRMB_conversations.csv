TRMB is a great infrastructure play and the top holding of the ARKX ETF. JMHO
Congrats to this basically empty board. All-time high heading into earnings.
Another solid quarter. We should see north of $40 again soon
This is a company with solid and growing earnings. Highly unusual for it to be the #1 holding in an ARK ETF!
"TRMB is a dynamic company into field of autonomous driving, infrastructure construction, data analytics etc. However this message board is very quiet saying that not too many people are interested in this company. I am surprised."
As someone who works as a GIS analyst I see first hand the growing demand of geospatial analysis in many sectors Across N.A. As long as Trimble can handle this rapid growth I believe this stock will continue to outperform
Major beneficiary of the infrastructure bill. All those projects have to be engineered before they begin. This is what Trimble does. The transportation division not so bad either.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Rightpicker.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Will the results boost the share price? Will there be an upgrade by analysts?
A 15% profit margin - it's a good margin but I would expect higher for what is essentially a subscription based service.
"This stock is a winner . On a pull back, I buy more . I am heavily weighted in this company so I follow it every day. I haven’t heard about shipping or labor problems etc . This company is growing fast which can be good and challenging at the same time but seems like management is handling it well . If anyone hears any updates on the company, please post . We’re in for the long haul .$CELH $SIG $A $TRMB"
"ARKQ bought another 112,972 shares today. I can’t believe this gem hasn’t caught the eye of more analysts, but their silence also means institutions are quietly accumulating. TRMB is perfecting land management, mapping, planning, planting, growing, harvesting, transport, processing.. to say this is being slept on is an understatement."
#$%$ analyst doesn?t know Jack squat
"ARKX is now a $344 million fund and growing, they just added 380k shares of TRMB last Thursday. BTW, the stock is also the 3rd largest holding of ARKQ fund."
"Piper initiated coverage today with an overweight rating and $101 price target. Aside from the silly false precision price target, the report is very good and should put to rest the ignorant bear argument peddled by hack analysts and buyside managers too lazy to understand the story but instead rely on charts"
"The inclusion of TRMB into the S&P 500 is a huge validation of its business model transformation over the past five years. Many Wall Street analysts missed this infrastructure story and stood on the sidelines while the stock tripled. Now we're in the big leagues - an important designation for a relatively small, under the radar company"
"Many months later still chaos.ARF struggling staffing. 3rd shift not taking off, semi-automation isn’t working as planned. Very very concerning considering volume increase / heavy backlog /"
"Hello?? Anybody here?? Institutional buying day after day, right at 9:30am... Institutional Owners: 1199 total, 1174 long, 12 short Aug. 19, 2021 Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $750 million in repurchases of the Company's common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and replaces the prior 2017 authorization of $600 million, of which $50.7 million was remaining and has been cancelled."
"Cathie Wood run up the price by buying and now she's taking her profits and running the price down.When I was young, we referred to a young lady acting like that as being a ""chippy."""
"Institutional buying every morning like clockwork. Hopefully another strong ER can lead to some upgrades. Probably not undervalued at 90, but definitely underappreciated. I like the moves they have been making, starting the venture fund, partnering with Boston Dynamics.. etc. Long term hold and a strong future."
