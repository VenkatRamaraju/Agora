I heard about DFFN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
after this week people everywhere are gonna be talking about dffn
"Diffusion Pharmaceuticals (DFFN)As for the final stock on our list, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals develops new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most. Currently going for $0.95 apiece, one analyst thinks that now is the time to snap up shares.Covering DFFN for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Swayampakula Ramakanth is looking forward to the initiation of its COVID-19 study. At the end of May, the company received a response from the FDA regarding its Pre-Investigational New Drug (PIND) meeting request on the proposed clinical development program to assess trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms and low oxygen levels.The FDA stated the study should be designed as a double-blinded, controlled, randomized trial by including Gilead’s COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir, as a component of standard of care for hospitalized patients. Additionally, the agency also accepted the proposed safety and oxygenation marker endpoints.If that wasn’t enough, Ramakanth highlights the fact that a European COVID-19 study of TSC will be conducted in collaboration with the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), which is the largest provider of treatment for COVID-19 patients in Romania. “Diffusion expects to enroll the first patient for the European study in June, upon regulatory approval, and report initial data in 3Q20, which we believe could be a catalyst,” the analyst said.It’s true that the ongoing public health crisis could slow down the enrollment for its Phase 2 PHAST-TSC (Pre-Hospital Administration of Stroke Therapy-TSC) stroke study, designed to evaluate the therapy as an acute stroke treatment. That said, Ramakanth remains unphased by a possible delay.“In our view, given that the pandemic is starting to abate and TSC is being studied as acute treatment, Diffusion could be able to get the PHAST-TSC study completed as planned. While reporting the company’s 4Q19 earnings, management stated their expectation to complete the study enrollment in 2021 and report topline data in 2022,” the analyst explained.Based on all of the above, Ramakanth rates DFFN a Buy along with a $3.50 price target. This target suggests shares could soar 286% in the next twelve months. (To watch Ramakanth’s track record, click here)"

If you’re going to buy in wait for .39
"If you believe in your investment then you hold and wait it out. Sometimes you are up, sometimes you are down. I have learned my lesson and sold too many times when a stock went down to 'get out before I lose more' only to see it turn around and go much much higher. I have lost out on 10s of millions of dollars over the years. It is sad to see people act like a stock going down means you need to sell. IF TSC does what I think it can, then this stock will be life changing for anyone who owns it. Sure, it is a HUGE risk and can be worth zero one day. I am willing to take this risk and ride the red days. If you are not then jump ship. One of us will be right. If it is you, then congrats. I am willing to lose my investment."
Wait.. another drop on the way…
Dffn has sales growth of 0% year after year.the CEO should be locked up!Just takes peoples money and feeds them Bull _ _ _t!

"JAGX just announced an R/S & their SP was 2x this one, no non-compliance notice. DFFN has a history of R/S with a non-compliance date fast approaching. Bag holders feel like gambling?"
"ALL OF TODAY'S GAINS, WILL BE GONE, BY THE END OF THE WEEK!!"
Good news and this tags still can’t hit a dollar￼
this stock is gonna be a game changer.....there is a reason why top notch names in the pharma industry are joinning this team.
Make sure to average this down before it jumps
"Finally some good news. This drug has so many possibilities. It is unfortunate they side stepped from previous trial milestones and decided to go in a new direction. I understand the costs were going to be enormous and long to continue with GBM and stroke trials, but they had gotten so close with strong results. That is why I originally purchased the stock. Had they continued, I think we would be looking at a $5+ stock by now. However, they were concerned about the expense without a partner so decided to go a different path that they new they could afford on their own and then either go back to GMB and stroke down the road when they have deeper pockets, or more likely, find a partner once they prove the drug's success treating other ailments. We have a long road ahead, but they are moving along and doing it as quickly as they can. 2022 will be the year we really know what they have. Until then, we can only hope the stock finds new life and can head back up. I am not counting on anything overnight, but will continue to hold and wait it out. I am still a strong believer that this will be life changing. Good Luck Longs."
They had some interesting insights about DFFN on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"The most important piece of information from the shareholder letter, is the second sentence in this quote:“we believe we have sufficient cash resources to fund our planned clinical trials and other operational needs through 2023. This includes the capacity to fully fund a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating TSC in the initial indication we will choose and identify in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expect to commence in the first half of 2022.”"
"They are in no compliance only since 5/6/2021, why would they do a reverse split? they have like a year before delisting."
the day has come
What is cooking ???
another r/s coming is all dffn has to come
"BREAKING: Dr. Llewelyn just joined Diffusion this month as Sr. Director and Head of CMC (pretty important position!). She came from Incyte - a $15 BILLION company. “While at Incyte, Dr. Llewelyn had the privilege of providing technical and leadership oversight to bring medicines to patients; from early phase clinical studies through to approval for commercialization, both in the US and globally.” She was at AstraZeneca before that. Talent like her flocking to a nanocap company with a novel treatment with such wide potential affirms that this company is infact serious in getting its flagship drug to the market. she must have seen something before leaving a multi billion dollar company for DFFN."
In next month we will see .30 n later on .20….. I fee

"Top Penny Stocks To Buy Under $2.50: Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc.Market Cap: $59.3MClosing Price On 5/22: $1.24Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (DFFN Stock Report) might be the longest-standing name among the names on this list of penny stocks. We began following it more closely after a very aggressive drop last year. In late-November, shares were trading under $0.32. At the time, Diffusion began turning heads after presenting early findings from a Phase 3 glioblastoma study. These findings showed that inoperable glioblastoma patients had increased survival results. Since then, DFFN stock has bounced between lows of $0.25 and highs of $0.55.[Free E-Book] The Beginner’s Handbook For Trading Penny StocksBut the recent momentum seems to have not only sparked strong momentum, but DFFN stock managed to bust through a major resistance level. It has also maintained trading above this level which may indicate it as a potential, new support. Regardless, the company has been attracting attention in the second quarter. It began after Diffusion announced that it has started a cooperative research effort with University of Virginia Health and the Integrated Translational Research Institute of Virginia. The co-op was to evaluate Diffusion’s novel small molecule Trans Sodium Crocetinate in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection.Jump to this week and DFFN stock is continuing its uptrend. The company announced that it has entered into an agreement with the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases. It will begin a clinical trial program to test Diffusion’s lead drug trans sodium crocetinate for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients presenting with lowered blood oxygen levels.The company also closed on a $12 million offering at an average price of $1.05. However, Diffusion said it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund research and development of its lead product candidate, TSC, including clinical trial activities, and for general corporate purposes. Friday’s session sparked new momentum and DFFN stock closed at $1.24. Will the latest cash infusion and clinical trial program continue to propel momentum through the end of May?"

"“If you believe in your investment you shouldn’t care about losing money.”-Greg, zero credential pumper"
That letter is a desperate attempt to get the stock to trade above a $1 before a possible de-list or reverse split. which looks pretty inevitable over the next several months. I dumped everything a few months back. This is a shell game of a company. How could their trials progress any slower than they are?? They just want to ride this thing into the dirt and and ultimately it will be the dirt
Man..
