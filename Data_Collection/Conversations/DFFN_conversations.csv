"Today is far from over and I still think we will end up, possibly way up. But even if we are down some today, it is nothing to be slightly concerned about. Always gonna have down days on the way up., especially after a huge run up this week. I think we will hear something within the next week (Monday/Tuesday a good possibility) that will add fuel to this fire. This is not a day trade so days do not matter. Months and months matter. Hold strong."
the first thing you need to do Monday morning is sell this cr@p and go to HALB. check it out and thank me later it took time and some delays but it is that close.
That letter is a desperate attempt to get the stock to trade above a $1 before a possible de-list or reverse split. which looks pretty inevitable over the next several months. I dumped everything a few months back. This is a shell game of a company. How could their trials progress any slower than they are?? They just want to ride this thing into the dirt and and ultimately it will be the dirt
"I don't understand why people get upset about qualified people getting positions in a corporate restructuring. Mr. Elder has a BA in Economics, an MS in Finance from VILLANOVA and a J.D. from UPenn Law - one of THE best law schools in America (an Ivy school, no less). He was the editor of the Journal of Business Law. Check out his endorsements on LinkedIn. I don't give a hoot what was endorsed (please recommend me for 'Domestic Homes Services', I make a one helluva sexy maid), but it shows the people that went out of their way to say ""yeah, I like that guy."" You don't go out of your way to endorse people, when you're a professional, if you don't know them. His work at the Journal of Business Law opened a lot of doors. The Vice President of JPMorgan Chase gave him endorsements on LinkedIn (they both worked at Creative Financial Group). An AVP at NASDAQ. Sales Director at E*Trade Securities. Vice President at Zacks Investment Management.The guy is smart and has connections to smart people. That's not a bad thing to have. Some connections are just 'hey, we went to the same high school'. But even conversations like that open doors. Interesting to learn about people. Wish I could find more information about the cases/SEC filings he has handled. Dechert is one of the top 50 law firms in the U.S., but they're also huuuuuuuuge. I believe they have something like 1000 attorneys throughout the U.S. Here's a brief press release of them patting themselves on the back. They do a lot of M&A work, and that's what he seems to have handled, from the folks he's affiliated with on LinkedIn, that he's had some background in M&A. https://www.dechert.com/knowledge/awards/2020/1/dechert-ranked-by-bloomberg-as-top-firm-for-private-equity-in-us.htmlhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/william-elder-3879555a/"
"Jack, you should stop accepting diluted shares for your shoddy work as a the Chief Prootional Officer for this BK operation. These shareholders won't even get a paper share to use to wipe themselves. Guys like you belong in a federal prison cell."
FDA recommended to use the product with Gilead's Remdesivir is a clear sign that they want a supplemental product that help patients recover faster while Remdevisir reduces the viral load TSC will improve oxygen levels resulting in faster and improved recovery and since TCS is very safe and it will be easily approved on expediated level
"Marc... Those 0.35 warrant have already been executed. Look at the recent prospectus. After the Wainsworth's warrants at $1.31, there are 8 million warrants with execution price at $4.86. So unless I am missing something, and please let me know if I am, we are in great shape with the warrants as this stock needs to get to at least $5.00 before there is any major dilution from warrant execution. Then it is clear sailing from there (warrant wise).Here is the stock and warrant position as of now:The number of shares of our common stock outstanding after recent offer is based on 47,821,992 shares of common stock outstanding as of May 15, 2020 and excludes:• As of March 31, 2020, 560,524 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options under the Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2015 Equity Plan”), at a weighted-average exercise price of $30.60 per share; • As of May 15, 2020, 8,043,514 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.86 per share;• As of March 31, 2020, 485,602 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2015 Equity Plan; and• 571,429 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants, at an exercise price of $1.3125 per share, to be issued to the placement agent as compensation in connection with this offering as described in “Plan of Distribution.”"
well... at this time it's marginal trading.a 2 cent gain on 10000 shares.... big deal
"ALL OF TODAY'S GAINS, WILL BE GONE, BY THE END OF THE WEEK!!"
"And for the final time for all those who for some reason don't get it:The first 24 patients will never be reported on 'how they are doing'. It is all about 'how much TSC dosing can they tolerate without side effects'. We are told no issues with toleration as they have increased which will be up to 1.5mg/kg. It is great news if we can get to strongest dosing amount before the larger trial starts. That 2nd trial will go much quicker as we do not have to wait every 6 patients for over 2 weeks to monitor tolerability. They can dose as many patients as they have available in the follow up phase without waiting. The dosing will also include Remdesivir when applicable. Those up to 300 patients will be reported on 'how they are doing'. At anytime during that follow up, the FDA can give EUA. So we are at most 4 months away from some incredible data. How is that not great news?"
"Great finish. There was a pretty large wall built at $1.00 so it was unlikely that was going to break today. However, tomorrow is another day and I hope to see the momentum keep going as we anticipate some updates any day now. We are getting back to more respectable prices. IMO we are still way below value with the near-term possibilities. Once TSC proves itself in trials and the results hit mainstream media, just imagine where this can go. And all that is possible in the coming months."
"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it will invest up to $500 million into publicly traded drug developers to fund their treatment candidates and provide access to the U.S. drugmaker's scientific expertise.Pfizer said it will make non-controlling investments in the biotechs with small- to medium-sized market capitalizations, but did not identify them.The move comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has led drugmakers to delay their clinical trials testing various therapies.Pfizer said its Breakthrough Growth Initiative program, under which it was making the investment, allows partner companies to access its research, clinical development and manufacturing resources.hmmmmmmmmmm"
"I’m not sure why people believe it will reach 3.5 when it has higher potential to reach $5-10, analysts are based on what they see and have, but the potential dffn has is way higher when one thing is successful which leads to another higher target."
"One of the greatest investors of all time, Peter Lynch, was noted as saying that ""insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise."" Insiders are prevented from buying and selling their company stock within a six-month period; therefore, insiders buy stock when they feel the company will perform well over the long-term."
"FACT. So hold on please.The FDA’s accelerated response to the PIND meeting request recommended that the first U.S. TSC COVID-19 study employ a double-blinded, controlled, randomized clinical trial design to address the wide variability in standard of care due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 experience. The FDA also recommended incorporating, where available, the drug remdesivir, which has been newly approved for emergency use, into TSC clinical trials as a component of standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe disease. The FDA agreed with the safety and oxygenation marker endpoints proposed by the Company for early trials of TSC in COVID-19 patients and suggested a range of potential functional outcomes which might be used as primary endpoints in possible later-stage trials supporting product approval."
"There is absolutely no reason the FDA will not approve TSC for the ARDS trial. It has proven to be very safe with no side effects. It will most likely be fast tracked as well. These are the next two big steps for DFFN. The above, along with similar news coming from Europe, I only see a great upside for this stock short term. If all above happens, which very likely will be this week, DFFN should be trading upwardsof $3-$5. The big news I think we need soon after is a large Big Pharma partner to help fund these trials and be the backbone for TSC to go into full production once all trials all done with success. We are all desperately looking for any help to fight the war against Covid-19. Why would the FDA not award DFFN the chance to do the trial with TSC to help beat ARDS? Then have to approve this trial which will greatly boost our stock."
"It’s been an interesting week and a good week to say the least. I believe the biggest spike today was profit takers that were allowed to enter in the .70’s? Appears we continue to gain new investors.Here is a video with Jane Hollingsworth as a special guest on “Money Matters” in 2014. I believe that it’s pretty clear what she brings to the table. I like how she explains the importance of these smaller companies being “active” and not “passive”. The mentioning of the contacts that she has obtained over the years and that her law degree has come in handy. But what I really liked the most is how she explains that she always starts at the “end”. Meaning, what is the market looking for and what does the market need, and not something that everyone has. That being said, I encourage all investors to watch the video for an even deeper look into Jane’s knowledge and experience, keeping in mind, this video is over 6 years old and I’m certain she has even more to offer now.Here is some food for thought. Not long ago, I read on here, someone suggested that the company should have began with “ARDS” vs. “GBM”. When I read it, I remember thinking, great comment, followed by, hindsight is always 20/20. So, out of curiosity, I did a little research and discovered that the “GBM” is a 7mm market with an unmet need. It’s possible that it was much more prestigious at the time to attract investors?Right now, it’s obvious that focus has shifted with perfectly good reason, that being the “pandemic”. However, if you do some research regarding the “ARDS” market, it too, is now projected to be a 7mm market, with an unmet need.Robert with the small “r”, do you even know how much 7mm is? LOL!I digress, and I apologize for the sarcasm. More so, if you watch the video, Jane explains that if you are viable and well-funded, that would be the time to take a chance. Fortunately for all of us, it appears the script has flipped and we very well will focus on the “ARDS” market, first.Personally, I invested because of the “Stroke” trials and the possibility of ‘TSC’ becoming an “Ambulatory” treatment, pre-covid. I continue to invest because of all of the possibilities.Important to know, UCLA Stroke Unit approached the company, stroke treatment wasn’t in the pipeline.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0YG2Z8iKxk"
"(from DFFN Shareholder Group on Facebook)For those interested on my take on what the 'short-term' plan is with TSC... The first stage of the Romanian 'COVID' trial was completed and we are awaiting exciting secondary endpoint results soon. The next stage of this 'COVID' trial is not going to happen. This trial was approved for testing solely for the purpose of treating COVID and nothing else. So to go through many more months of expense and trials just to get an approval to treat this one ailment did not make a whole lot of financial sense. They know TSC will treat ARDS in general, so this is the new path they are taking. To get approved for ARDS will be huge and long term (and I believe will include treating ARDS caused by anything, including COVID). The 'COVID' trial was used as an usually fast way to test the tolerability and safe dosing amounts for ARDS. It was never their plan to continue after this phase. These results will be used to go to the next phase of ARDS. Before they go to this next trial, they are completing the 3 short-term trials (1 down, 2 to go) to get results they need to move forward. As CEO Cobuzzi stated, they are looking for the shortest and most cost effective way to get TSC to market. ARDS is that path and they want to get there before going back to the longer and much more expensive GBM and Stroke trials. I love this mentality as getting TSC to market and getting revenue will be huge. Revenue means we no longer need to worry about large stock offerings and dilution. There are so many possible uses for TSC, let's focus on one area, get it to market, and then tackle the rest. I feel very comfortable with where we are and where it is going. It is not going to happen overnight, but unlike anything else I know of, if it happens, it will be enormous. Good luck and stay patient longs. If you believe, give it time."
"Looking at the activities since April 2020, DFFN is actively doing all the ground work to bring up the value of the company (working with universities, hospitals & FDA). They even do a $12 Mil shares distribution to help maintain the share price to be above $1. All these show the company has good management and have their interest in the company. The board of management remains unchanged hence have faith and confident with them and ride along."
They had some interesting insights about DFFN on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Added another 25K at $1.11. I feel confident Monday (or days after) we are going to get the announcement that dosing has begun and the stock is going to head back up fast. You have seen what similar news has done to other biotech share prices. No guessing what DFFN will hit. But I am not selling either way. The results of Phase 1 will be out in weeks after which will put another, much bigger, push up on this stock. It will not take much to skyrocket our share price. We have a extremely low float and market cap. Good luck all."
"Will be much less stress moving forward from now than what we all had in the past 2 weeks. What a roller coaster ride eh? Tomorrow looks positive again. Things to look out for tomorrow:1. Update about new plan moving forward or some short of news about IND and clinical trail in US.2. Confirmation of Nasdaq Compliance.3. Update about Europe clinical trail and starting time-line.4. News about potential partnership with GILD on clinical trail.Whether there is a news or not tomorrow, I don’t see DFFN to go down much anymore, if nothing it will go sideways all day or gain a bit. Or it could lose slightly a bit. But not a bad way to end the week!"
"JAGX just announced an R/S & their SP was 2x this one, no non-compliance notice. DFFN has a history of R/S with a non-compliance date fast approaching. Bag holders feel like gambling?"
"Let's put something else in perspective. If I had told you just two trading days ago that in two days the stock was going to be trading at $1.11+ with a huge bottom support of $1.05 and have an additional $12 million to go towards COVID-19 trials, you all would have said impossible. So sure, the new shares diluted the stock, but the $12 million cash flow influx should well make up for it and we should see it reflected in the stock price soon enough."
"Jane Hollingsworth has a nice resume as seems like what we investors need in this company. She co founded two bio tech companies that she grew and eventually sold. She most recently was a managing partner of a company that ""makes visionary science and technology a business reality with the potential for the highest value returns for investors and life saving treatments for patients."""
wow. such great upward potential here. I'm definitely HOLDING.... And I'm sure the news next month will be positive
"""Diffusion believes its cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020, along with the warrant exercise proceeds, are sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure, including clinical trials, into the third quarter of 2021.......:The above statement will propel DFFN to $1.00+ in the next few days. The next FDA announcement regarding the COVID - 19 will see some serious gain because of the low float.Good luck all!"
Good news and this tags still can’t hit a dollar￼
"Finally, stock has been held down pending today's meeting, even though they've already stated no need for a reverse split. Hat's off to those that have held strong and farewell to those that haven't.Questions that should be posed for clarification today.1.) S-1 and S-1/A regarding warrants, since there were so many experts here with opinions.2.) What phase will the U.S. trial begin, expect explanation due to regulatory pathway?3.) Explanation of partners, what does it mean when they say they are looking for partners?4.) Expectation of UCLA stroke trial resuming.What am I missing?"
"All the people who keep clamoring for a PR about the start of Romanian trials or the US IND submission, need to relax. Neither one of those events are going to move the stock price much, let alone to the lofty expectations of some on this board. Second, as it was stated in the shareholder meeting, the company will likely wait for initial data from the Romanian trials before submitting the US IND, as they will probably have to make revisions to it based on what they see.If you are a shareholder hoping for a short term gain, then you are stuck here until at least August, possibly September, because that is when they stated they will have analyzed the data from the first 24 patients in the Phase 1a Romanian trial. Even with it being an open label study, I doubt you get information sooner than that, because of the low number of patients.If you were long on DFFN prior to the announcement of the possible Covid indication, then you were hoping for a successful stroke trial, because that would definitely have sent this to the moon. However, since most of the proverbial eggs have been put into the Covid basket, we are really all in the same boat for the foreseeable future.If the Phase 1a shows proof of concept and warrants moving to the Phase 1b portion of the trial, I have no doubt we will see a 300-500% increase in the share price as it stands right now. If the phase 1a is a bust, then we are likely headed back to the basement in that 40-50 cent range, and the company is going to have to make some serious decisions on what they tackle next from their pipeline.Either way, it’s a waiting game until then, and there are many other stocks better suited for day traders trying to make a quick buck. So, let’s all relax for a bit. GLTA."
"Stock price is way off the last two days. Good news is I am told we will get a full update on trials when the Q320 financials are released. They do not have a firm date yet on the PR, but it is anticipated by next Tuesday. At least we know an update is coming soon to answer many unknown questions. I for one will just hold tight until then and hope for the best. Good luck."
"Every biotech that got double , triple ... during last week went down 30-40 percents . DFFN did. Not follow the same pattern pretty much Kept all of the gain actually . It’s a great sign specially with our volume today . 10 cents down compare to last week means nothing bad actually I would say it’s a good news it corrected its price and went down 10 cents I believe the news will be out tomorrow or Friday . We will see a Green Day tomorrow I believe due to todays action"
"From DFFN 8-K filed yesterday: “We at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases are expediting our collaboration with Diffusion Pharmaceuticals to test TSC’s novel oxygenation-enhancing mechanism of action to treat ARDS in patients with COVID-19,” said Prof. Streinu-Cercel. “Given the shortened response times for regulatory approvals and the immediate availability of patients, we expect timely enrollment and prompt completion of the first phase of this study.”"
"@Coach D. I disagree. Very sound investment here. However, it is a sound investment for a long position. You invested to early. A lot has changed in the past few years. TSC is likely to become a permanent supplement to the current standard of care for a wide range of conditions where hypoxia needs to be addressed. If helpful for covid19 that is just a cherry on top. DFFNs intent is to bring TSC to market. Everyone should do their own DD. You will find when TSC comes to market sales will be in the Billions. Being invested here for that would be wise. TSC has already been previously vetted by the FDA ahead of the FDA approving it to be administered in the ambulance for phase 2 of the acute stroke trials. That is fact not opinion. There is no logical arguement for it not receiving FDA approval to assist with ARDS affecting people who have severe covid19 cases. The phase 2 GBM trial results were very strong. A big partnership or buyout is less of a question of if and more of a question of when that announcement comes. You can expect big news here soon"

this stock is gonna be a game changer.....there is a reason why top notch names in the pharma industry are joinning this team.
"We all need to be patient - for realz. I am a firm believer in this company and its potential. I would MUCH rather wait and have honest, verified and accurate results released, rather than have the company put out some meaningless press release, hyping short-term results based on trials which only included a small number of people -- which would give the stock a bump for a day or two -- as we all know, some of the other pharmas/biotechs have done this over the past few months. I firmly believe the people running this company are highly ethical and are not in it for short-term stock gains - they are in it to help the ""greater good"" - and maybe while they're at it, they'll get some financial reward as the stock price increases. Even if the results of the clinical trials re: COVID are not all that exciting - there appears to be great promise in TPC's treatment for other deadly diseases, as Greg and others have duly noted. I am willing to wait - for long-term, sustainable results. GO DFFN!"
"People here are questioning management and going as far as thinking they made a mistake on the IND. That is not at all what is going on. The first FDA guidance was based on the Preliminary IND (PIND) submission. This PIND guidance from the FDA allowed them to create and file an IND, which had a much greater level of detail. With this new level of detail, the FDA’s response also has a new level of detail, which they are harmonizing internationally throughout the program. (It was not a question of errors.) Following the FDA’s detailed guidance exactly is the best route to good relations with the regulatory authorities."
"No cash raise needed in short term...""Diffusion believes its cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020, along with the warrant exercise proceeds, are sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure, including clinical trials, into the third quarter of 2021."""
"FYI : In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days from the date of such notice, or until November 2, 2021, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the bid price for the Company’s common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days."
"I do not think I am too optimistic. Nobody thought the share price would drop this low before an exciting announcement is expected. If investors are getting wary and jump out, then so bet it. I am in big. I am not worried. Do I like we are at $0.96? Hell no. Did I expect it, hell no. But I am still confident the next PR will be very soon and will be positive. So if the stock jumps back up huge, it doesn't matter to me where we are today. There is not reason for the stock price decline. There is no bad news. Obviously, if we had bad news, then my outlook, along with all, would change. But with no news, I am confident and not worried at all. I am waiting on news as every investor is waiting. All we can do. I see no reason why or how it could be negative so the current stock price doesn't scare me."

"What another great day, following a day of disappointment.First off, who in their right mind would sell at this point in time, unbelievable? Second, so much disappointment expressed within with management over a presentation that wasn’t meant for us. Are you serious, complaining about a cheap sheet and no hype? If you want hype, take a look at what happened to GNUS investors not long ago. That was all “HYPE”, and Buffet and Gates names all over it, more hype. Speaking of Buffet, being one of the richest and most successful investors on the planet, whom happens to cut his own hair, do you think he would be concerned about a cheap sheet as a backdrop? I believe he would only see the value of a dollar saved. This company has little overhead, no debt and plenty of cash. More so, would you invest if this guy came across as a snake-oil salesman. Or some cocky over confident lizard wanting to take advantage of the pandemic?Let me share what you should have focused on during the conference. Unmet need and rare opportunity. Like yourselves, I was disappointed when he mentioned 4th quarter. However, I remember when the former CEO David Kalergis stated, we need to be patient and take our time to get it right. He suggested a 30 day window after the Romania trial to determine dosing at the Annual shareholder meeting. And we all should now know, that probably isn’t going to happen. Keep in mind, I am paraphrasing and you can replay the meeting online. The rare opportunity that SARS-CoV-2 or covid-19, is going to allow the company to gather lots of data from dosing. Meaning, entirely more than every study combined. And, gather the data to not only be used for this trial, but utilize the data for any and all future trials. GBM, stroke, covid, etc., etc.. So, I would certainly agree this is a rare opportunity and now makes even more sense why they chose to do a trial in Romania.Covid-19 isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon. There is no vaccine or treatment that will be a silver bullet. Like it or not, this is tortoise and hair. The path less traveled, no hype train, slow and steady is a good thing. All future vaccines and therapies aren’t going diminish the unmet need. Many, may infact, need “TSC”, to buy more time to be effective.How many investors do you think we’ve obtained after this conference? How many weak hands and bandwagon jumpers have we lost because of this conference? Stop being so emotional about your investment. If you can’t, maybe you should cut your losses and look for other opportunities. If your still vested at this point, you better have known all this time, “they know it works”! Otherwise, you should have ended your position long ago. Also, you need to come to the realization. They aren’t interested in selling this company. You have grand delusions if you think differently. Don’t get me wrong, everything has a price. I just believe the price will be too high.Last but not least, stop with the conspiracy rumors. There is no point of the SP moving big, until something big happens. And, be prepared for our biggest SP move with no news what so ever. It could come like a thief in the night. Once we file with the FDA for the U.S. trial, you will have an opportunity to exit. However, make no mistake, when that happens, we will already have more data then we’ve ever had regarding “TSC”. And it will apply to applications that we haven’t even discussed on this forum.Disclaimer: I’m heavy and long, not pumping, in fact, because I’m still buying, I encourage your exit. And my overall desire, is a dividend in the future."
Huge support at .48 could be a huge spike
"If history teaches us anything, then we should be close to our low. Last month when expecting trial initiation news towards the end of July, we started moving higher after the first week of the month, about 2/3 weeks before we expected news. Now, we are expecting news around the 3rd to 4th week in August (2/3 weeks away). So we are almost on the same timeline as when we started are push upwards last time. As we know, this stock is a funny little creature, so no telling it will follow the same path, but it is something to hope for. One way or the other, I will be surprised not to be back in the mid $1.00 range by 8/24."
"Next week we should start our rise. I would expect an announcement on 8/24, but hoping we get it the week before. The two weeks before last expected announcement we went from mid $0.80s to well over $1.50. We are at a much higher starting point as I think we locked in more long term investors. Hoping to see another 2 week rally coming up. Maybe get us close to $2.00 before the announcement. Our time is coming very soon. It is a good time to jump back in if you played some other stocks recently. The next PR will tell us that dosing has begun. That should bring in some major volume. Good Luck!"
"I am not sure what to guess, it could be both way! Either it's just low volume and dropping randomly or DFFN Management deliberately doing this by releasing a no point PR yesterday, so the shorts clearly would know there would be no update till Wednesday, so they would push it down below $1, so the management can gain approval for RS by scaring the shareholders (if it closes below $1 today and Monday) even though it's not needed right now, they can use the RS in their favor anytime in the future. People I am not saying it is true, I am just saying the possibilities and looking at their PR history and the words mentioned in the PR yesterday (they've never done PR close to the weekend before), It doesn't matter at this point, whichever case please vote against the RS and whoever holds more than few thousand shares it is your investment and you don't want to take a loss on that, so please spend an hour on Wednesday morning to attend the meeting online. I know some of you will be against it and didn't want to hear this, but what matters for me and all other longs are to protect my and everyone else investment. There is no doubt that we will get the FDA approval in a few weeks are so and there are lots of good things to come, but we don't want to be the victim of RS, so please vote against the RS on Wednesday."
With COVID cases increasing this product (TSC) has huge potential - and ventilators have been shown to do more damage than good. TSC is a ventilator alternative. The TSC market will last for years because the vaccine is so uncertain. I was iffy at first but I bought in.
"Time to move uptown, could see huge gains very soon"

"Top Penny Stocks To Buy Under $2.50: Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc.Market Cap: $59.3MClosing Price On 5/22: $1.24Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (DFFN Stock Report) might be the longest-standing name among the names on this list of penny stocks. We began following it more closely after a very aggressive drop last year. In late-November, shares were trading under $0.32. At the time, Diffusion began turning heads after presenting early findings from a Phase 3 glioblastoma study. These findings showed that inoperable glioblastoma patients had increased survival results. Since then, DFFN stock has bounced between lows of $0.25 and highs of $0.55.[Free E-Book] The Beginner’s Handbook For Trading Penny StocksBut the recent momentum seems to have not only sparked strong momentum, but DFFN stock managed to bust through a major resistance level. It has also maintained trading above this level which may indicate it as a potential, new support. Regardless, the company has been attracting attention in the second quarter. It began after Diffusion announced that it has started a cooperative research effort with University of Virginia Health and the Integrated Translational Research Institute of Virginia. The co-op was to evaluate Diffusion’s novel small molecule Trans Sodium Crocetinate in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection.Jump to this week and DFFN stock is continuing its uptrend. The company announced that it has entered into an agreement with the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases. It will begin a clinical trial program to test Diffusion’s lead drug trans sodium crocetinate for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients presenting with lowered blood oxygen levels.The company also closed on a $12 million offering at an average price of $1.05. However, Diffusion said it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund research and development of its lead product candidate, TSC, including clinical trial activities, and for general corporate purposes. Friday’s session sparked new momentum and DFFN stock closed at $1.24. Will the latest cash infusion and clinical trial program continue to propel momentum through the end of May?"
"For all you short term minded investors, day traders or whatever you want to call yourselves think about this. Novavax was trading at 4.30 range this time a year ago. Today it hit a new high of 111.77. So why are some of you continuously complaining about this company not posting the news the way you want it specifically catered to your liking when the management is doing everything they see fit and proper to escalate the trials and protocols to fruition and get both a FDA approval and partnership with a major pharmaceutical company secured which would absolutely send this stock to the stratosphere and make a lot of us patient long term minded investors very wealthy. So if you’re not of the same mind set as Greg, John , myself and surely a few others here maybe you should spend some time and do your own DD here and find out for yourself what the REAL potential lies here in this company. Faith is the key component here. Hope there are some of you here that will join us in what I truly believe will change your lives in an amazing way for you and your family. Be strong and stay long!!!"
"Considering the market and other bio stocks, we are doing extremely well. Investors are not running nor worried about recent bumps. Hoping we get info on Romania trials starting early next week. Should boost us back through the highs. Stay long. You will not be sorry."
GREG WATSON FAN CLUB!
"Well, as I have wrote earlier , the offering at $1.05 was positive for DFFN as it gave a support not to go below $1. When the news breakout for offering at $1.05, it was hammered/shorted to almost $1from $1.45 on 15th .We need to keep in mind that $1.05 is almost double of the last offering made at 50 cent?So there were buyer at double the price in just couple of months.I am bullish on TSC . Ofcourse it is a life saving treatment. I think the shorter will be squeezed next week. Today DFFN is already up by 20 cent. My conviction increased when I saw big and well known Funds increasing the stake in from Jan onwards, viz : 1). Renaissance Technologies LLC 4.29% 1,679,1872).BlackRock Fund Advisors 2.10% 820,779 412,852 Both the funds have given excellent return to their investor and hence the presence of both this funds is great for me. Perticularly Renaissance has bought more and increased stake .Well, this is my analysis why I bought it.Not a buy recomendation . DD is a must."
"Oh wow the website is very modern and legit now. I’m loving every move the new management is making so far. If you click on “Our Company” in the drop down menu, it has a “seemingly” accurate counter of how many patients have been dosed to date in trials. It’s currently at 160 so I’m guessing that’s across all phases of testing for all conditions. Either way I’m curious if we start to see that number grow monthly or maybe even weekly. Very exciting times for DFFN!"
"Another email response from Mr Kalergis. I questioned him on the FDA IND submission since during the meeting they said it would be 'this week' (meaning last week), but also said they were holding off so the initial Romania results did not have to be duplicated. I also asked him when those results can be expected. I was hoping it could be revealed since it was talked about in the meeting. However, no luck. He was nice and appears excited. Dear Greg: I greatly appreciate your interest in the Company and its progress. Because of SEC and NASDAQ rules, I’m not allowed to give individual investor updates. The Company’s policy is to issue timely press releases upon the occurrence of newsworthy events.Sorry I can’t say more as I love to talk about the Company, but I can’t, so please stay tuned as the journey continues.Best regards to you. David K."
"The reason they added the acceptance from Romania in this PR is that we would have not heard about that on it's own. That is not a major milestone so they just decided to give us an update to those trials. We were and still are waiting on the PR that trials have begun. First dosing is a milestone and we will hear about that soon after it happens. From the sound of everything, should be any day. Maybe tomorrow. Probably this week."
"I am thrilled with what we are seeing since the DO came out. A strong base around $1.05, many people accumulating and not wanting to sell and a couple of days away from being in compliance. As long as we get good news from the FDA next week, DFFN is going to explode well past where it was before the DO. Now there is no guarantee this will happen. I think our chances are fantastic since TSC is very safe and has been effective providing oxygen in other studies, so why not a trial it for ARDS? Wouldn't make any sense to me to deny that trial. But even if you are not as convinced as me, say you are 50/50, I think your risk vs reward is well worth it. If the FDA news is negative, DFFN still has so much more going on (Europe trials for COVID plus their already existing trials for other illnesses here in the USA) so where do you think the price drops back to? At the very worse, $0.50. But more likely it won't fall nearly that much. I would say after the initial sell off, it will hover in the $0.80s-$0.90s. Too much other potential for it to go much lower. On the other hand, if this does get FDA approval, this will explode. I would say a minimum of $2.00 and then a very good chance it goes many dollars higher. Trading is no more than gambling. We have to play the best odds, and I think it would be hard to find a better 'game' right now than DFFN."
earnings on the 9th will show huge profits of $10 per share
"DFFN product is already in Phase 3 of the trial, believe it will get FDA approval. The product has huge potential, watch it."
"@Tony Wow, you finally posted something accurate. You are correct, trials do take 6-7 years at least with phase 3 is the longest. However, if you spent less time posting nonsense, you would understand. ""TSC"" is currently operating under ""Regulatory Pathway"".Regulatory PathwayIn the USA, drugs are approved by the FDA by three main regulatory pathways: (i) 505(b)(1) new drug applications (NDAs); (ii) 505(b)(2) NDAs; and (iii) 505(j) abbreviated NDAs (ANDAs). The appropriate pathway depends on the active ingredient, already approved drug products, drug formulation, clinical indication, route of exposure, among other factors. The 505(b)(2) NDA pathway is a regulatory approval pathway that allows sponsors to use existing public data in lieu of conducting studies; thus, potentially offering significant drug development and marketing advantages. Nonclinical testing programs for 505(b)(2) submissions are often reduced and, in some cases, are not even required. This paper provides an overview of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway with a focus on how nonclinical programs can be streamlined and accelerated. Therefore, in simple terms that even you will understand. Because of previous trials, we aren't on a new path. TSC has been afforded the opportunity to skip a few phases. Hence, The Phase 1b study is being conducted at the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases.What is a Phase 1b clinical trial?In phase Ib trials, the dose of an investigational drug is gradually increased to determine the optimal safe dose. This process is called dose escalation. The first participants (cohorts) are given a small dose of the drug.More so, these are unprecedented times and the World is acting accordingly. Fast TrackFDA has created a special emergency program for possible coronavirus therapies, the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP). The program uses every available method to move new treatments to patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time finding out whether they are helpful or harmful. We continue to support clinical trials that are testing new treatments for COVID so that we gain valuable knowledge about their safety and effectiveness.The regulatory approval timelines in each Romania, Moldova and Ukraine is 7-14 days! The regulatory bodies in these 3 countries are fully committed to ensure PRIORITY REVIEW for COVID-19 research submissions. ARENSIA has the expertise to perform regulatory submission in all each country, with fantastic support from local authorities.Therefore, Emergency Use Authorization will work just fine until 'TSC' is brought to market. Remdesivir, needs 'TSC' to be successful right now. You should research how much money our government has vested in Remdesivir. And, how many other covid trials have been suggested to be combined with Remdesivir?Last but not least, once we get this virus under control, the GBM and Stroke trials will resume. Guess what else, they will have a lot more data that can and will be applied to those trials because of this rare opportunity."
"DFFN look what is happening around us people. There are new strains of the virus which could make any of the vaccines obsolete. DFFN is needed more than ever. Almost 400,000 children now have been infected with a disease. The damage that is leaving in people is irreversible lung and organ damage. The damage of prolonged ventilator use is running rapid. The world needs this drug it needs it to work now. Dffn realizes this and will not rush and make mistakes. they will not make false claims to get people excited the price of their stock means nothing to them at this time. When the time comes the price of the stock will surpass everybody's wildest dreams if this drug works as needed. we are talking about a company that will turn into a multibillion-dollar company overnight. The new strains of the virus that are ten times more infectious and more deadly is leaving lasting effects on major organs because of the lack of oxygen. Yes as investors we need this drug to be real but more important we needed to be real to help the world get through this nightmare. Not even including that this drug will help all cancer patients throughout the world who are on chemo. No we don't have a tiger by the tail we have a whale by the tail I hope for everybody's reasons this drug is true and does everything that it is expected to do. What do I think the stock price will be when you turn a company that makes no money into a multibillion-dollar company overnight I just think BOOM"
"We have talked about Stroke and Covid, but the GBM use which is in Phase 3 could be huge: 6x survival rate!In the dose-ranging portion the Phase 3 Glioblastoma trial, DFFN announced that the largest dose showed an 86% survival rate for 6 out of the 7 patients at the 14 month mark, in inoperable glioblastoma. The drug combination has a very favorable safety profile. This survival rate can be compared to the average historical survival rate of 9.2 month in the control group. Based on Phase 2 survival curves, the 2-year readout for this trial could show 60% survival, versus 10.5% in the historical control group. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIWWZeFcGWM"
"Very peculiar day. Seems like other stocks followed similar pattern. It is disappointing, but nothing to be concerned about if you are here long-term. More action to come this week. FDA approval is huge and no additional funds are needed for the testing. Don't worry folks, it is a matter of time. Nothing comes easy. The road will be bumpy. But the much higher stock prices are coming."
"According to Dave, the CEO, the offering was done now, before any FDA approval news, so the company is ""free to focus on the creation of a value-enhancing COVID-19 program, without a “financing overhang.”""I take this as they know approval is coming and want to be ready to roll with it and not worry about cash flow issues. Thought?"
Dffn... Some other things to think about. Read the press release and what it talks about that they are involved in. Read the mission statement for the company in what they're involved in.Just a few numbers to show you what they're involved in. The United States spends approximately 46 billion dollars a year on stroke related expenses. Cancer drugs are exceeding 42 billion dollar s. Alzheimer's is exceeding 277 billion dollars.Parkinson's disease over 25 billion in medicine cost.Dffn drugs work with all of these problems read up on them so you see what I see. That's just in the United States worldwide you're talking over a trillion dollars.If you think for one second that big pharma who has multi drugs on the market already who need the assistance of the drugs that dffn have would let this out of their site you're crazy. I assure you they have a lot of people looking over their shoulders watching and waiting. They are doing the right thing they are bringing in management that can deal with what's coming and not be overwhelmed. It's so easy to find the figures that I have all you have to do is Google it. Stock price means nothing it doesn't matter if you paid $0.70 or $1.50 the most important thing is you are in. Like the old saying goes you can't win if you don't play.
Their cash significantly increased for the upcoming research.Don't worry about R/S.They don't need it and don't worry about compliance. It's not your business.They hired excellent staff and the results will come out soon.It is so cheap to buy more.It is a chance.You'll see babes.
Hi Gary
"COVID-19: Updates on vaccines and therapeuticsveiri posted this little nugget earlier todayhttps://www.id-hub.com/2020/03/19/covid-19-updates-on-vaccines-and-therapeutics/ “Typically we think of FDA authorization as meaning that there is data and information that in the agency’s view shows the product is safe and effective for its intended use. For example, to approve a drug, FDA must determine that there is ‘substantial evidence’---consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations---that the drug will have the effect it is intended to have. An EUA, on the other hand, can be authorized if ‘it is reasonable to believe that . . . the product may be effective.’ The EUA standard is simply a lower standard, and everyone should understand that.”TSC has received accelerated approval for clinical trials vs authorization vs EUA vs clearance vs exemption.The information is relevant because it demonstrates that there is substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect intended. The PRE-IND meeting would have stopped the PIND in its track if TSC wasn’t a viable treatment.Upon hitting the NASDAQ compliance ‘milestone’, and being aware there will be a few more boosts to share price prior to results. And that’s great for traders. However, I feel we are approaching the moment of truth for long term investors. Myself, if I didn’t believe in the prospect, I would have cashed out the other day. Even if we aren’t successful in this ‘Covid play’ there is the longer investment of the original intended purpose of ‘TSC’. Which I too believe is the bigger fortune and this current opportunity has certainly given it a lifeline. Therefore, with that said, I would have bailed or at least reduced my investment. This is for all the marbles and like it or not, I’m more than okay with the ‘Remdesivir’ news. I will share a short story and the relevance on that next."
The real Greg has to be in insider of some sort. He posts 2 days ago a couple hint to buy and boom. 
"People forget that not only are we waiting for Covid dosing to be announced any moment, but we also have the Phase 2 stroke trials (dosed on ambulance) back on and could hear any day about a partner for the Phase 3 GBM trials. This company has so much potential and making sure everything is done methodically. Covid trials are being done so they are accepted globally. With this low float, stock price has so much room to soar. I’m excited for next few days and next few months."
"Great news came out! today announced dosing of the first two patients in the Company’s open-label Phase 1b lead-in trial of its novel, oxygen-enhancing therapeutic, trans sodium crocetinate (“TSC”), in 24 hospitalized COVID-19 patients."
"Stability in trade and averaging out in vollume shows strength. Current resistance shown by close-to offering price, and no major swings. Very good news and gives me confidence moving forward. Looking for first and foremost: compliance. Second, positive news from FDA. Finally, a plan moving forward. If we hit all 3, major things can happen. Stay patient, rome wasnt built in a day."
"I emailed the company about the cash raise and got this reply from a David Kalergis...""We didn’t need to raise money to continue current operations, so the statement was true; but the financing will give us the extra money we need to conduct a set of value-enhancing COVID-19 trials. Believe me, it will be put to good use. Please hang in there. DK"""
"news from Nasdaq that they are not in compliance with 1 dollar minimum bid price rule. what can they do and how long do they have to meet this requirement and what happens if they do not. they received notice today,"
One thing to think about when you talk about TSC IS IT GIVES DOCTORS WHAT THEY ALL ASK FOR MORE TIME. I like many of you out there have lost family members to cancer pneumonia in all types of viruses and we have all heard the doctors make that one statement I wish we had more time because I could have done more. I know this sounds corny but isn't that what the whole world is screaming just give me more time so they can help the loved ones. We as investors aren't the only ones hoping that this is real...... The world is also hoping that this is real just so we can give the doctors a little more time.
"wow, after almost 1 1/2 hours of opening its up 5% on a huge volume of …. 1 share! wow."
"Stay tuned for Greg to suddenly make an appearance. He’s very busy & just doesn’t have time to comment when the stock is red, which is quite often."
"“If you believe in your investment you shouldn’t care about losing money.”-Greg, zero credential pumper"
"Diffusion Pharmaceuticals (DFFN)As for the final stock on our list, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals develops new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most. Currently going for $0.95 apiece, one analyst thinks that now is the time to snap up shares.Covering DFFN for H.C. Wainwright, analyst Swayampakula Ramakanth is looking forward to the initiation of its COVID-19 study. At the end of May, the company received a response from the FDA regarding its Pre-Investigational New Drug (PIND) meeting request on the proposed clinical development program to assess trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory symptoms and low oxygen levels.The FDA stated the study should be designed as a double-blinded, controlled, randomized trial by including Gilead’s COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir, as a component of standard of care for hospitalized patients. Additionally, the agency also accepted the proposed safety and oxygenation marker endpoints.If that wasn’t enough, Ramakanth highlights the fact that a European COVID-19 study of TSC will be conducted in collaboration with the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), which is the largest provider of treatment for COVID-19 patients in Romania. “Diffusion expects to enroll the first patient for the European study in June, upon regulatory approval, and report initial data in 3Q20, which we believe could be a catalyst,” the analyst said.It’s true that the ongoing public health crisis could slow down the enrollment for its Phase 2 PHAST-TSC (Pre-Hospital Administration of Stroke Therapy-TSC) stroke study, designed to evaluate the therapy as an acute stroke treatment. That said, Ramakanth remains unphased by a possible delay.“In our view, given that the pandemic is starting to abate and TSC is being studied as acute treatment, Diffusion could be able to get the PHAST-TSC study completed as planned. While reporting the company’s 4Q19 earnings, management stated their expectation to complete the study enrollment in 2021 and report topline data in 2022,” the analyst explained.Based on all of the above, Ramakanth rates DFFN a Buy along with a $3.50 price target. This target suggests shares could soar 286% in the next twelve months. (To watch Ramakanth’s track record, click here)"
"If this drug is successful covid-19 will be a fraction of what this drug can be used for. I think of diseases, flus, all types of pneumonia,all types of heart problems that involve respiratory problems with it. All types of allergies that have life-threatening respiratory problems with it. All types of birth defects that involve respiratory problems. Drug overdoses that involve respiratory problems in lung shutting down. Smoking related problems, asbestos related. there are an infinite amount of possibilities. People who look at this as a coronavirus helper cannot see the forest through the trees.There are over 8 billion people in this world. Do I think this could be a big deal yeah I do. But one thing at a time you have to walk before you run. Like I've said in previous post big pharmer is watching. They won't let this get away. If this is real it's going to get real real fast. So let's hope everybody knows what they're doing because I'm sure they've had many discussions with the powers-that-be how things will go if it's real. Can't wait for Tuesday Tik-Tok baby tik Tok."
"Always always always pops on news, then falls back until more news. Does not change the fact TSC is the real deal and will take a little more time to prove itself as it successfully has to date. Too many people trading here but investors will continue to come. Disclosure: bought in at $.60 last April and just bought again at $1.60 and holding."
"One thing to keep in mind...every medical worker and paramedic who administers or knows of administration of DFFNs trial drug, will see results the next day. They know what a severe stroke does and what patients look like the next day. They may not be able to public release what they see, but they can purchase stocks like DFFN is they see positive results. I think that's what has been happening over the past month. Covid19 is a factor, but I think the real interest is coming from the on ambulance trials. Paramedics and doctors are buying DFFN based on what they are seeing. That's a theory and we will have to wait for preliminary results to prove it."
"They are in no compliance only since 5/6/2021, why would they do a reverse split? they have like a year before delisting."
looks like a buy out is in the works
"I was tempted to sell at 1.5 and buy back at 1.25 but then considering all the risks, I left it as is, and glad I didnt sell because next week will be substantially high of 1.95 to 2.5, knowing fda is ALREADY approved."
"Just want to link my article again for people looking into this stock. It will be locked to paying members-only in a few days, but still available for free by going into it from my profile on Seeking Alpha.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4309131-diffusion-pharmaceuticals-tsc-thoughts-potential-glioblastoma-indicationHope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!"
"Dilution completed and FDA said yes instead of no. Those were the 2 short term risks. Should be a steady rise going forward, and Nasdaq compliance later this week."
"Germany’s BioNTech (BNTX) and its US pharma partner Pfizer (PFE) announced on Monday that their vaccine candidate is more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a trial of over 43,000 participants.“Today is a great day for science and humanity,“ said Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and CEO of Pfizer in a statement. “The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19.”"
"positive test results and a huge investor/investment in the company, huge plans in motion for TSC, and this was just after we had management changes and additions for the sole purpose to push these types of things to start happening and the price goes down. Dilution or not I'm a rookie trader so correct me if I'm wrong but it looks to me like the stars are finally lining up for this stock."
Man..
"Based on the large number of strokes that occur in the U.S. every year, and the billions of dollars that treating stroke victims costs the healthcare system each year, we believe that TSC could become a blockbuster drug in the treatment of stroke and we estimate for potential peak revenues of over $1 billion worldwide. However, we have reduced the value of the GBM indication in our valuation model as the company will not move forward in GBM without a partner, although with the encouraging data from the 19-patient run-in portion of the Phase 3 trial we believe the chances for a partnership have increased. Our valuation currently stands at $1.50 per share."
"Just went back and read so many negative comments earlier today from so many of you about how awful the management is and how they do not care about the stock price. How they don’t send out enough PRs. Some even question the reality of the trials and company itself. This board had turned very pessimistic. Hopefully the PR today with this new hire and confirmation the trials are starting any day will turn the sentiment around. This company knows they have something special and are taking the right steps to be successful. Do they care about the stock price on a daily basis? Hell no and neither should you. They care only about the big picture and with success comes wealth. It takes time, but the stock price will only go up as they move ahead and get the positive results from trials. So if you are a believer and here long term, don’t complain about the small stuff. Don’t sweat a few delays here and there. We are not making hamburgers, we are saving lives and it has to be done methodically."
"found the presentation (finally), anyone that misunderstood the following with that enrollment is stalled and only two were in the trial could be having a total mental problem. see below. also , look at the TAM, see the presentation, we are talking of huge markets and domains, bigger than teslacurrent study status:September 10, 2020: announced first two patients dosed ● Complex protocol evaluating a different dosing regimen and PK sampling in hospitalized patients during a pandemic ● Enrollment of no more than three patients at a time and then review of data by an external safety monitoring committee ● No dose-limiting toxicities have been observed ● Patient enrollment continues"
"Here is why I think this price is still a good buy. I have been following this stock since March of last year and made my first purchase in April. Until this past week, outside of here, stockwits and the Facebook page, DFFN has been pretty much unknown and not talked about. This weekend, we EXPLODED in the Reddit world along with other places (youtube coverage, etc). So a huge new number of investors are learning of DFFN and TSC's potential. We should have news this offering has been closed at anytime. I have seen stocks fly after that news hits. It could put us passed $2.00 alone. Then we have a new trial starting in the next couple of weeks. Another reason for the stock to get a boost. Finally, in the next month or two we will hear the big news and find out how well TSC worked in the Romanian trial. That could very well take us to the next level. So I am very optimistic both long and short term. I am hoping we get over $2.00 and beyond soon enough. Good Luck Longs!"
"The reason why the general public has not been informed so far about the stages and results of this study is explained by Prof. Streinu Cercel : “There are clear rules regarding the communication of results and their publication in specialized media. It would be premature and I would break the rules to comment on partial results or to express our opinion before completing the study and evaluating the results. ”You have been named the Principal Investigator of the study. In this capacity, can you tell us, after five months of experimentation, what are the results of this study, how many patients recovered, how many died and for how many of them the drug in the testing phase had no effect?""What I can confirm is that most patients who received these therapies reacted positively,"" said Prof. Streinu Cercel."
"Unbelievable the reaction we are seeing now. Hold this. It’s potential is hardly impacted. For the ones who are selling, I wonder why you invested in the first place. We do not have to repeat it’s potential for GBM, stroke, cv-19 etc. For cv-19 vaccines will never be sufficient on their own and the first ones will only become available mid next year. There is a need for this and a week later or earlier will hardly impact the shareholders value in the mid/long run."
"This new hire should be a huge confidence boost to where this company is going. If it were a 'scam' like the bashers here claim, they would not have hired her and more importantly, she would have never taken the job. This company is the real deal. They know they have a special drug and they are on the right path. If you are impatient then go somewhere else. If you have time and can ride this out, I see a huge potential. We should be picking up larger investors due to this hire and this will greatly help the share price both short and long term. Tomorrow and the rest of this week should be interesting, especially if we get the dosing email. Good luck longs and congrats."
"I see lots of heated up arguments going on since the S-1 filing. My advise is simple if you believe in the company and if you don’t care about a small drop and bounce back temporarily, if you think it’s worth holding it till your price target, then just do it. What really matters to me overall growth of the stock till my target price is met. I really don’t care about little things and what other people say, I know my price target will be reached eventually, and I will be patience till then.If you think it’s going to drop because of S-1 tomorrow and you don’t want to go through this, then simply sell your stocks at premarket or whenever you want and wait for the dip (that if you want to renter again), I am sure most of the longs average prices between .50 and $1. So even if you sell it you are going to walk away with profit and not loss. But be cautious before you sell your stocks if you want to buy it back in the dip, because you never know what happens next, there are lots of hype going on about DFFN lately. You don’t want to regret later because you wanted to save a few cents. The best is yet to come, I wish everyone all the best."
"everytime it goes up, something is pushing it down"

"Fidelity ETF (ONEQ) increasing it's position in DFFN as evaluation time shortens from months to days.Diffusion’s COVID-19 program is a cooperative research effort with the University of Virginia Health System (UVA) and the Integrated Translational Research Institute of Virginia (iTHRIV). To aid in timely trial enrollment, Diffusion is in discussions with institutions located in areas of severe COVID-19 incidence, both in the U.S. and in Eastern Europe. Similar to the FDA CTAP, health authorities in certain Eastern European countries have implemented emergency policies to compress regulatory review cycles from months to just days. These policies could expedite partnering possibilities with one or more Eastern European national institutes currently treating hundreds of COVID-19 patients daily, with almost immediate study start up and shortened time to data.“This news of accelerated FDA review of the proposed clinical development plan for our lead compound TSC in a COVID-19 ARDS program is most welcome,” said David Kalergis, chief executive officer of Diffusion. “We continue to work with hospital and regulatory authorities in the U.S., and now also in Eastern Europe, to forge the fastest possible pathway to approval for TSC in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.”Today, DFFN should see mid 0.80s and close in 0.60s but there is a possibility of crossing a $1 milestone in coming few days. So, hold on longs."
Just got an email from Mr Kalergis (CEO). His response:The GBM program is not enrolling while the Company and the medical community focus on COVID-19.I responded that we investors see the GBM as the fastest route (outside of possibly COVID) getting TSC to market and would like to know the plan once COVID is behind us. Will post any response I get.
No hope ..
"We should expect some news in the next week or two and as we lead up to that news, I would anticipate the stock continues to climb back to 'normal' ranges. I will be happy to be back over $1.00 by week's end, and with any news that we are moving along, continue up from there."
Congrats longs! Nice day to finish and hold close to $1.20. We hit a 6 week high and are up 50% since Friday's low!! Looking forward to the next few trading days. There is so much to be excited about here!
"I have learned from over 20 years of investment that it's hard to predict the perfect entry point or the exact top, the strategy that works for me is to get in when an immediate bad news is behind you and the potential great news is in future yet to happen, delisting/ secondary offering is behind us and the start of trials and potential partnerships with Moderna or someone else is a possibility, so I decided to take a large position , hopefully it will work out."
Buyout or merger? both good
Bougth 30k more today at 1.24 . Was buying Nio at a slightly higher price last year. I have researched this company and I do see major potential in here.
after this week people everywhere are gonna be talking about dffn
"I will reiterate again if and only if they announce that TSC is working this is going to the moon, it’s starting to get abit of momentum now and there presenting at this weeks bio conference (give is a google). I can’t emphasise enough how much demand this drug will get as a result of depleting medical O2 supplies worldwide.

"For those freaking out about closing under $1.00, do not let it bother you too much if it happens. Obviously we are 1/2 way there (5 days away) to being in compliance and getting it out of the way would be nice. However, we have until August 24th to do it. So if no news comes in the next couple of days and since we are treading just above the $1 mark, closing below $1 is a possibility. However, we are all here because we are fairly certain good news is coming any day and this stock will soon take off. So if we are right, this will have plenty of time to cover the $1 closing limit for 10 days. Do not panic and sell if this starts trading in the $0.90s. There is far greater upside to this stock then any short pit falls.Good luck to all. Hope everyone here gets a nice return on your investment soon."
"Not only was the reverse spit voted down, we voted not to allow them to amend to the company’s certificate to reverse split at a later time without a vote. Stoke trial was never paused, enrollment priority slowed due to pandemic. For those that don’t know, UCLA stroke unit approached Diffusion Pharmaceuticals for this partnership for stoke victims to be dosed in ambulance.After reviewing the transcripts, you’re going to have a better understanding of why certain decisions were made and why it’s taking so long for them to file the IND. Furthermore, your going to understand that these aren’t your typical ‘phase I, II, III’ clinical trials. They are accelerated trials in a class of their own. I paraphrase CEO’s comments, “20 years of experience dealing with the FDA, never has he seen the FDA move so fast regarding a disease”.Romania trials are proving grounds to aid U.S. trials in dosing data, better data for FDA IND. They’ve been studying and preparing ‘TSC’ for oxygen deficient tumors, not ‘covid19’. They have every intention to utilize data from Romania trials, specifically dosing amount(s), to prepare the U.S. IND. Once the IND is filed, the trial is expected to be quick. In addition, all data, especially good data, is what drives interests from outsiders interested in partnering with Diffusion Pharmaceuticals.The Phase III ‘GBM’ trial surprisingly wasn’t mentioned are discussed by either side, company or shareholders. I believe, the study is paused and they were just waiting for ‘endpoint’ survival required by the FDA, which results were expected end of this year, beginning of next year. More to come.."
This will resume the upward trend from today looking at the time line for the next weeks big catalysts...all the longs are very safe at this point and expect humongous reward....as it will retress the 1.79 levels..
"To all the confused people here on this board, this is not a offering offer￼ing, This is just those warrants being exercised now which means no negative. DFFN is playing smart this time they are filing it before big news to avoid any confusions, they want to get things sorted out before their announcement next week or so, this is a great chances for any bigger guys want to get in or smart traders wants to get in because everyone knows the price is going to spike from next week. Again read the filing fully and understand before you sell your stock. You will see it would be almost back to normal before the AH closes. Don’t be in rush to sell it off because you think it’s a new offering. This was already announced and now it’s just getting the money into company’s bank account, which is even better for the company because this was already announced and priced in, good traders would understand what this exactly means..."
"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 20, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:DFFN) (“Diffusion” or “the Company”), a cutting-edge biotechnology company developing new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) to begin a clinical trial program to test Diffusion’s lead drug trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients presenting with lowered blood oxygen levels, a condition known as hypoxemia. Noted infectious disease researcher Prof. Adrian Streinu-Cercel, M.D., Ph.D., General Manager of the NIID, will serve as Principal Investigator.Conduct of this clinical trial in Romania will be facilitated by ARENSIA Exploratory Medicine GmbH, a Germany-based contract research organization with dedicated state-of-the-art clinical research facilities located throughout Eastern Europe, including within the NIID.Patients with COVID-19 and other severe respiratory tract infections often present with hypoxemia. Diffusion and its affiliated researchers believe the oxygen-enhancing mechanism of action of TSC could benefit COVID-19 patients by mitigating the multiple organ failure that often results from hypoxemia associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients.The NIID trial is planned to be conducted in two phases, with a possible third to follow. The first trial, which is fully funded by existing Diffusion resources, is a Phase 1 open-label, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, ascending-dose safety lead-in trial in 24 hospitalized hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. In addition to collecting safety and tolerability data, study endpoints will include arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry measurement. This trial is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. These data are intended to provide proof-of-concept for the use of TSC in enhancing oxygenation of hypoxemic patients with severe respiratory infections, like COVID-19. Assuming positive results, Diffusion intends to promptly commence a follow-on trial, also fully funded by existing Diffusion resources, in approximately 100 patients at an expanded number of study sites in Europe. This follow-on trial will be a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, safety and efficacy study of TSC in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Depending upon the results, a third phase, designed with a view to regulatory approval in Europe, may then be conducted.Commencement of the NIID program is expected to be facilitated by a special Romanian regulatory authority initiative for COVID-19 clinical trials that reduces regulatory approval times from 60 days down to seven days from the time of program submission, which is targeted for the end of May 2020. NIID is the largest provider of treatment for COVID-19 patients in Romania. NIID sources report that about 500 patients with COVID-19 are currently hospitalized in its facility, with about 50 in intensive care.As previously reported, Diffusion also is preparing for U.S-based clinical trials of TSC for the treatment of hypoxemia in patients with severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, which will be conducted largely in parallel to NIID trials. This arm of the Company’s respiratory distress-related hypoxemia program is being pursued in partnership with the University of Virginia and other leading U.S.-based research centers. A pre-IND submission is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a response expected before the end of this month."
"A full 33% of all traded shares were short sells today (7/13)...even with one in three shares shorted, price only dropped $0.023. Considering that about 10 vaccine companies are up 1000% on nothing but hope, and considering DFFN has a safe product in hand, being tested in multiple countries....I'm going to keep buying, and with any positive results, going to be buying up to around 5.50 a share. Ignoring and muting the short trolls here, and reading the science."
"The most important piece of information from the shareholder letter, is the second sentence in this quote:“we believe we have sufficient cash resources to fund our planned clinical trials and other operational needs through 2023. This includes the capacity to fully fund a Phase 2b clinical study evaluating TSC in the initial indication we will choose and identify in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expect to commence in the first half of 2022.”"

earnings... losses coming up on 9th.she's been a downer for so long.
"I feel we have shaken off all the day traders and jumpy stock holders and should have a bunch of solid, long term investors that believe in DFFN. That means once we get the news we are hoping for, a large number of us are going to hold tight so we should really take off and be able to hold the gains. We have been patient. The stock has come down from the highs, but has really held strong above $1.00. Our time is coming..."
"Who here actually read through the recent 8-K filing and Prospectus with details of the $12 million stock offering? This is my hard earned money invested, so I did (and I hope you do to). As of any Prospectus it points out all the reasons why this company may fail doing anything it is striving to do and the risk involved in making the purchase. Many investors, with much more investing understanding and experience then 99% of us here pulled the trigger and purchased at $1.05 ($12M worth!). Now of course this is no guarantee for a recipe for success, but to me, it is a pretty darn good sign that DFFN is not going much lower anytime soon and it has a great upside potential. Hang in there. Buy low, sell high. You haven't lost anything yet if you follow this rule. Thoughts?"
"BREAKING: Dr. Llewelyn just joined Diffusion this month as Sr. Director and Head of CMC (pretty important position!). She came from Incyte - a $15 BILLION company. “While at Incyte, Dr. Llewelyn had the privilege of providing technical and leadership oversight to bring medicines to patients; from early phase clinical studies through to approval for commercialization, both in the US and globally.” She was at AstraZeneca before that. Talent like her flocking to a nanocap company with a novel treatment with such wide potential affirms that this company is infact serious in getting its flagship drug to the market. she must have seen something before leaving a multi billion dollar company for DFFN."
"The only chance we have here near term is a partnership. Who knows these clowns running this company have a knack for pump and dumps. Maybe they can get this back over a dollar before being forced into a r/s. Miracles do happen, we sure could use one now."
"This investment has been liquid for a while. It appears, due to timing, a few investors bailed on other short term opportunities. Possibly hoping to increase their position here and aren't worried about capital gains. Unfortunately for them, it doesn't appear that is working out the way they planned. I can assure that a few of them are holding shiny new bags where they are now. I believe overall we have better options for Covid 19 in general. And with that said, they will never see the light of day. It's a shame, but there isn't money in cures, only treatment. I just don't believe there is a better investment for Covid 19 than this one. With that being said, It's good to know that this will aid in the Government's backed race horse ""Remdesivir"".I have no idea when to expect a ""Press Release"", I do know the time has passed and we weren't denied. Not to excited about PR anyway, since the SP never holds. So, I'm hoping for the best results and expect EUA because of it. Those of us that are left, this is the path least followed."
"We are weathering the storm well as it is holding strong. As stated many times, we cannot expect much movement or much volume until we get some news. Since we have no idea if the PR will drop tomorrow or December, I don't expect the 'anticipation' run-up we have had in the past. All who know about this stock and our invested are holding tight. All signs point to insiders know the trials are showing very successful results. The company has put itself in a prime position to make a positive announcement and move this company to the next stage. Once we have the news, I would imagine long term holders are going to hold tight, and even buy more. The attention will draw a huge new flow of buyers. Some in it for a quick buck, but many others long term investors. With very little selling and a huge influx of buyers, the stock price is going to blow by recent highs. No doubt in my mind. Remember, we are just looking at safety concerns (160 patients already dosed with TSC and no issues) and dosing levels for the next phase. Obviously, they will pull the plug if testing is showing no positive outcomes, but I think we can put the question to rest with all information they have released thus far and the fact that the trials continue to move forward. Good luck!"
"Finally some good news. This drug has so many possibilities. It is unfortunate they side stepped from previous trial milestones and decided to go in a new direction. I understand the costs were going to be enormous and long to continue with GBM and stroke trials, but they had gotten so close with strong results. That is why I originally purchased the stock. Had they continued, I think we would be looking at a $5+ stock by now. However, they were concerned about the expense without a partner so decided to go a different path that they new they could afford on their own and then either go back to GMB and stroke down the road when they have deeper pockets, or more likely, find a partner once they prove the drug's success treating other ailments. We have a long road ahead, but they are moving along and doing it as quickly as they can. 2022 will be the year we really know what they have. Until then, we can only hope the stock finds new life and can head back up. I am not counting on anything overnight, but will continue to hold and wait it out. I am still a strong believer that this will be life changing. Good Luck Longs."
"I will admit, the past couple months have been extremely frustrating as a shareholder. Like others on this board, I felt the complacency that the company was exhibiting was extremely detrimental to shareholder value. Although this company is far from just a Covid stock, that is where their focus will be, probably until at least mid 2021. Dragging the start of the lead in trial out as long as they have (for multiple reasons) and setting such a lengthy timeline to data readout, could cause us to miss out on partnerships, LOs, or even buyout opportunities that may have been more likely earlier in the pandemic. I’m not saying those possibilities don’t exist now, but the delays have definitely not maximized our value and I think have hurt shareholder confidence.That being said, I go into this weekend with a renewed sense of optimism on the near term outlook of this company. I think we finally have the management in place who can lead this company in the direction that most of us think it can go. I think the complacency is gone and they are definitely hungry and focused on gaining shareholder trust and making this company a winner very quickly. I’m once again looking forward to what the next month holds for us (fingers crossed we have data from lead-in by then). Near term value obviously hinges on those results, but October could be a very exciting time for us. GLTA."
"I would guess this is the slow climb back to $1.00 as we await news. At this point there is only good news coming short term so we should be heading upwards. The big jump will be Aug/Sept when we get some feedback from the trials. But it is still a great time to buy IMO. We are off our lows and gotta believe $1.00+ will be here any day now. From there, who know... Once any positive results come in, the upwards jump is unpredictable."
at some point it will be a better buy and hold than todayno news nellie
"Hoping we get one of our big runs soon. It is nice to see a little recovery this morning, but we are just bouncing around on low volume. Not sure when it will head up, but like I have been saying, we are very undervalued right now as I believe $1.50 is the fair price by Aug 24. That is less than 3 weeks away. Might get there is a couple of big days or may just keep bouncing around and slowly move up. But one way or another it would be surprising to me not to get back to where were were in SP ($1.50+) before the announcement."
RS comes next mounth?
how is the new life in the 40’s?
"We were sitting at a price share last week that made no sense. I don't know how we got there other then unusual high amounts of shorting. We are finally back to the low end of a reasonable stock price, but still way undervalued for its short-term potential. There are so many reason why we should continue up even without news. Shorts are going to have to cover. And there are a lot of them out there. The overall market sentiment is getting more and more negative. I personally think it is way overvalued considering the state of this pandemic. So investors are going to want to start moving money around and COVID stocks are a great option right now. We are not a big name out there, but getting one as time goes on. Once these trials start, and especially once we start getting feedback, investors will be flocking over and buying huge chunks. Just imagine what will happen when we finally hit mainstream media and FOX/CNN start talking about TSC and interviewing Mr Kalergis. That is a big IF, but we have that HUGE potential and if TSC works like we all hope, I have to believe that is the direction we are headed."
"Who is excited for tomorrow? We should have great volume all week with upcoming possibilities. Stock will be in compliance this week and FDA news is expected along with other possible releases. Whether you are long or short, this is the place to be for some excitement. Stock could easily double. Of course there is the other side, but I am too optimistic to bring that up. If all goes well, just think by week’s close where DFFN could be."
"Another big sign that TSC is working well in Romanian trials. From yesterday PR:Dr. Galloway...will assume responsibility of...product development efforts, including clinical trials with...TSC, which is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1b clinical study... In addition, Dr. Galloway will lead the expansion of the Company’s work with TSC into other hypoxia-related conditions.""First off, they are VERY clear the Romanian trials are ongoing (for all those crazy conspiracy theories from the bashers that the trial has failed). Then they tell us Dr. Galloway will expand the work with TSC into OTHER hypoxia-related conditions. How much more clear can they be? This trial must be going so well, that they are now ready to expand the trial into other uses for TSC fighting hypoxia other then just COVID. Currently, this Romanian trial only addresses COVID. However, at anytime Diffusion has the right to EXPAND the trial to test it against other/all causes of hypoxia. So we may not be getting a direct PR update on how the trials are going, but it sure is not hard to read between the lines! Exciting times are coming."

"Hello Beautiful people. I just saw this stock DFFN last night and read all the information and news I didn't think twice and bought some shares average price of $1.53 today. Fly DFFN fly, up up to the sky."
"Although I am not thrilled about the offering, especially the timing, the fact that they are able to offer DFFN to 'certain institutional and accredited investors' at a $1.05 is VERY impressive. Now, of course, I would have rather seen this offering at $1.30+, but the company needs to make sure this is offered at a discount to the current trading price otherwise nobody would buy in (as the price in the open market would be cheaper). They probably decided on this price on Friday during trading and had to use the low end of the trading day for a 'fair' low end value. For it to make any sense, DFFN now has a LOW POINT of $1.05 as this is the offering price. For these investors to buy-in, they must have a lot of confidence the stock has good news coming and their stock value has a high probability to increase well.I was away this morning, but if I had been watching, I would have jumped in big when this was under $1.00. Without this DO, sure, we may have seen $2.00 today or soon enough. Due to this offering, we have now been pushed back down. However, I am even MORE confident that we will stay above $1.00, come complaint and soon move forward with positive FDA news. This has slowed the recent boom, but hopefully it will help build an even better foundation for it to move much higher. Thoughts?"
"It is nice to see a lot of investors are believing in @DFFN and day-traders are disappearing from this board. It is a great day for DFFN. Today is a turning point for the best to come; I am very excited for many good events that are coming out and way to go for +3, +10, +20 and more. I just feel it. I am holding for long regardless of small bumps here and there."
I have no plan on selling a single share until the share price touches to double digits.
"To add to my post below... Let's discuss. What negative can possibly drive us down short term? They have raised money and said they have what they need for all current trials. They are in compliance with stock price. FDA just gave them a much better then expected response to phase 3 COVID trials (to be used alone AND with Remdesivir). This month we expect news that FDA phase 3 trial plans have been approved and moving forward (huge news). EU should make a statement about trials by next week (huge news). Just the FDA news alone has caused similar stock to more than double.So let me hear the other side as well. Whoever thinks this stock will go down considering all above, let me hear your thoughts. Intelligent thoughts that is (so yeah, T and MD that means you guys move on as you are on ignore and I won't see your comments anyway)."

"TSC is being talked about by Dr's, this stock will take off once it becomes one of the concoction of drug treatments for COVID (no side effects). It doesn't stop there, there is only one drug for stroke patients and not many patients qualify for it because of time and the type of stroke. Not for TSC, it can be given in the ambulance by the paramedic on any type of stroke patient, it would be considered a frontline medication for these and many OTHER ailment's (very few if any other drug is this versatile). Truly the sky is the limit for DFFN, easily could get past $60 a share in time. This will make a lot of money for the daily traders and more for the long investors!"
"I have to believe we have come to the bottom at these prices. Logically, this price makes no sense. The stock is in such a better position then it was last time it was trading this low and we shot up to $1.50+. I am hoping we start to get back to $1.00 over the next week or two and keep the slow trend upwards until we some kind of results. Strong and long. Good luck! (and don't think I bailed if I do not post every day. while we sit at these low prices with no news, it is not worth repeating and debating the same things over and over)."
Like Mike I am also in big on this stock. I don't think they ever will bring a drug to market I think the company will be bought before they can do that. I believe it'll be a very large company that has all the experience and manufacturing facilities to do it quickly. I won't waste my time telling you what I think the stock will go to cuz I'm sure I'll get laughed at but take a look around at other companies that don't have anything proven and look what they've done. 2 to over 40...1 to mid 20. If this drug is for real covid will be a fraction of what it is used for. You're talking about a multi-billion-dollar company overnight take a look at some of the profits these big pharmaceuticals make on one drug it is amazing. Hi yes and back to reality we shall see what we shall see good luck all

"With strong interim data on phase 3, either license/partnership or buyout is very likely. Question is when."
"If you believe in your investment then you hold and wait it out. Sometimes you are up, sometimes you are down. I have learned my lesson and sold too many times when a stock went down to 'get out before I lose more' only to see it turn around and go much much higher. I have lost out on 10s of millions of dollars over the years. It is sad to see people act like a stock going down means you need to sell. IF TSC does what I think it can, then this stock will be life changing for anyone who owns it. Sure, it is a HUGE risk and can be worth zero one day. I am willing to take this risk and ride the red days. If you are not then jump ship. One of us will be right. If it is you, then congrats. I am willing to lose my investment."
"Diffusion Pharmaceuticals has a really great website. Interestingly enough, no one has mentioned that some time yesterday, they began making some adjustments. Appears, they are ramping up for the world's eyes to see what they're all about. The 'overview' is brilliant and appears to be strategically repositioned, downside, the news/press releases are currently messed up."
"Phew... That was close. I might have been helping hold it at $1.04 all day. It took until the final minute of trading to finally finish filling my shares. I increased my holdings by 60%. As you can tell I am bullish, both short and long term. We do need some news ASAP though to spark more buyers and make sure this at the very least keeps closing over $1.00. I am not worried nor care about the AH price. It will jump around. Hoping to get good news before the weekend to get this back up. Good Luck to all longs."

"For all of those asking if now is a good time to buy and all those sitting on the sidelines watching, here is my opinion. Obviously, do your own research, but I will tell you that I have done a ton for over the last month. What I have found there is so little that can cause this stock to go down. Even if this whole COVID testing fails (which I am 99% sure it will go very well), they have so many other uses for TSC. Just the stroke end alone could be worth billions and that is in Phase 3 with great results up to now. But let’s talk about the COVID end. FDA has approved TSC immediately into Phase 3 (thanks Casper) double blinded testing. But not only does the FDA want it tested by itself, they also want it tested with Gilead’s remdesiver to see if it can improve its use. That alone, to me, makes this stock worth over $10 soon. If we can even slightly improve remdesiver’s success rate, it will be a must for Gilead to partner with us (IMO). Again, this is just a small part of TSC possible uses. If just one thing shows promise to move to production, DFFN will explode. If you are day trading, then you study your charts and decide your move. If you want to invest and believe, who cares if you got in at $0.50 or $1.50. If this is going to $5 (which is very likely can soon), then there is so much money to be made. Personally, I am holding long-term and hope to see this stock explode to numbers that most would laugh at me for suggesting. I hope, and strongly believe, it will happen. So again, do your research and let me know your thoughts. I would love to hear both sides."

"I asked this awhile back, but it would be interesting the response now as new people have come in recently.What is everyone's average buy and when did you first invest?If you want to reveal your position too, you can, but that is up to you.My first buy was this year 4/1 and I have 100,000 shares at an average buy of $0.85(bought in order at $0.57, $0.52, $0.80, $1.04, $1.24)"

"It appears some of the longs here are getting worried and I cannot blame you. Stock price is down when we were hoping it would start creeping back up. Other drugs are making announcements on COVID making this look less attractive. All I can say is I am still very long and excited with this company. If there is some new delay come end of this month, I may change my tune. But from everything I have read and researched, there is no reason why dosing will not be announced. Throw everything COVID out, and the stroke and GMB are still huge, but that is further way. I am still confident the COVID will be something positive and bring that much more value to the company. We had similar worries exactly one month ago when we were trading in mid $.80s. Nothing has changed in the company since then. Stock price is 25% higher and we have a much better chance to get this Phase 1 rolling and successful with the new FDA response. From my experience when the overall consensus gets a little worried pushing down the stock price, it is probably a great low point to buy. I have been holding back, but very close to adding more. I am just so heavily invested that after my last purchase I told myself that was it (but I may break my promise). Current stock price does not bother me at all because I know that when the dosing is announced and the ball is now rolling, it doesn't matter much if we are at $1.00 or $1.20, we are going up huge. IMO on all. But I have probably done more research on this company then most of you out there."
"Another institution just bought shares today 06/01/2020, good news for long investorshttps://fintel.io/so/us/dffn"
Iran expected to finish their phase 2 study of TSC this month. Will be very interesting to see those results. I am hoping they post something soon after. I am in contact with them and will let you know if I get any updates as to when we can expect some data.
"Lamont brought this up in a post 14 days ago.. CV causes death mostly due to of lack O2 to the lungs. There are many companies scrambling to find a vaccine/drugs for treatment. Vaccine is a year away at least. Many anti viral drugs and combinations of are being investigated with some early promising results ( Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Lopinavir and Ritiovir combo, APN01, Favilavir ).DFFN has developed a revolutionary technology in Trans Sodium Crocinate which safely re-oxygenates targeted tissues. I'm no scientist but it does occur to me that there could be a possible synergy of DFFN's technology and these other treatments that are being worked on--- food for thought"
"Good morning longs. What a fantastic couple of weeks we have had. Now, the presentations that will be shown this week and they are very impressive. We should easily hold our current stock price and I foresee it to continue the path it was taking upwards as we await the exciting news coming. Some have questioned why this trial took so long, but if they took the time to educate themselves and understand it, it would be crystal clear. This is by far the most important and most informative data collection the company has ever had especially for its use to treat hypoxia. To see full details on this trial, head over to DFFN Shareholder Facebook Page. I will be posting detailed info there shortly. Back to $1 and over soon!"
"The fact is, this volume is extremely minimal and is most likely short sellers or people who get a little anxious￼. This is a long-term stock and those who hold will be rewarded but you have to have a bit of patience￼."
"Quite period before merger announcement,"
"Let's think about this logically. The company 100% knows the results from early dosing. We do not know the exact date dosing began (PR only tells us people were dosed, could have been days or weeks before). By now, they have received a ton of data from these early dosings. Knowing the results, they hired Jane and now Elder. These two people are positions you hire when you are ready to explode the company. They also put Cobuzzi into the CEO spot. A man who is younger and better driven to control a larger biotech public company (he has this experience). Why would any of these movements happen if TSC was not working as they hoped? Do you think these two additions would have taken the job at a company with failed results? What good would their stock options be? They had to be enticed to come onboard. Nobody cares about current stock price. It means nothing. I do not care. Smart investors do not care. Management especially does not care knowing what they know and what is coming soon enough. So please bashers, please give us a logical explanation on these recent additions and changes in management if the trials are failing. Love to hear it something intelligent, but not counting on it."
"I am not sure if anyone on here has really talked about how positive the FDA approval news to move forward actually is. We are immediately going into double blinded test trials, completely skipping all initial safety trials as the company was expecting to first do. The FDA took into consideration past safety trials of TSC and accepted these results to immediately move the COVID testing into the 2nd phase. On top of all of this, the FDA see so much potential that they want TSC to also be tested with remdesivir to see if we can help Gilead's success rate. I am very surprised we did not jump way over $2.00 just on this news. However, it will all catch up soon enough. Way too much positive going on here. DFFN is a rocket sitting on the pad, waiting for the weather to clear to begin final countdown."
"People ask if they should sell after positive FDA news. That depends what you are here for. If you are looking for a short term nice gain and then move on, well that is your answer. If you believe in DFFN and have some patience, then I would hold. You are never going to time it perfect and sell at the high of the jump. It will bounce around. May retreat hard with profit taking. But very likely may boost again past those highs before finding a new level of trading. There is more news to come (Europe, fasttracking, partners, new phases etc). So you never know when the next news will hit. Could be weeks or even just days later. I will hold. If you could ignore the share price and magically see where you are in 3-4 months and not have to deal with the ups and downs to get there, I am confident you will be happy to have held. IMO"
"Make sure to VOTE today. It needs to be in before the meeting tomorrow. I just did mine. Voted AGAINST the stock split. Very important. It doesn't matter if you have 100 shares or 1,000,000 shares, everyone needs to get their votes in so management doesn't make the decision for you."
"So tempting to load up more at these levels. We have seen this low point many times with a return back to higher levels. An easy 20%+ can be made on short term trading. Tempting, but I am going to keep what I have and still wait for the long term treasures. I expect to see something soon to bring us back to the $1.00 trading zone. Good Luck Longs!"
"This is going to get a BIG spotlight once the PR hits next week. This is what I found from ARENSIA's website. ARENSIA performs complex Phase I/Ib/IIa and PROOF OF CONCEPT trials in 8 state-of-the-art research clinics - in Moldova, Romania, Germany, Goergia, Ukrainehttps://www.arensia-em.com/exploratory-medicine-unitsFurthermore, ARENSIA announced the beginning of Clinical Trial Program to test DIFFUSION’s lead drug for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients on May 21.2020https://www.arensia-em.com/news-26-arensia-begins-clinical-trial-program-to-test-diffusion-s-lead-drug-for-the-treatment-of-hospitalized-covid-19-patientsAnd the most recent announcement mentions FIRST TWO COVID-19 TRIALS APPROVED IN MOLDOVA WITH PRIORITY REVIEW. ""The first clinical trial will study a novel drug for the treatment of acute lung injury associated with COVID-19."" - TSC""The second trial will study a novel investigational product, which has shown a promising antiviral activity against several human coronaviruses."" - Remdesivir https://www.arensia-em.com/news-29-first-two-covid-19-trials-approved-in-moldova-with-priority-reviewI am very bullish and couldn't be more excited for next week."
"Remember that FDA approval may not come until the end of June, thats the latest. But having said that, based on other approvals being passed at the moment, it's likely to be sooner. Just saying though as if that doesn't happen this week then thats not surprising and no one should be disappointed.Also FDA approval is not the be all and end all, though I think its a given. There are also Romanian trials and a European regulatory pathway, which may end up being an even bigger driver of the share price than whats happening in the USA.Personally I don't think a vaccine is as close as many people think and therapeutics are going to become more of a focus as people realise this. Also even if there is a vaccine it's going to take 18 months to 2 years to scale that to the stage where most countries have enough.No matter which way one dices things this stock is cheap compared to many other CV plays but with much more to offer than most. And also it's not purely a CV play, so not a one trick pony. Regardless, I think it's going to be a big week and this will continue to run pre any FDA news."
Acadian Asset Management with $22 bil of portfolio has filed the form 13F showing it has purchased DFFN shares. Very bullish sign. It's getting traction from big guys.
"Finally I had the chance to listen to the last shareholder's meeting that is on DFFN's website.If you are long here as an investor, invest 30 minutes and listen to the meeting, ALL your questions are answered there, or at least listen to the last 8 minutes where the most powerful statements are made.I now understand that their PRs are not well written and when you listen to the CEO you will fully grasp where the trials are at and their projected path with fluid timelines, THEY ARE NOT RUSHING to file the IND with the FDA, as the application will be updated/constructed and revised as the data from the Romanian trials is received and analysed. Open Label study means that they will receive data/updates constantly without having to wait for the results on a final report. Once the data from Romania start to show how well TSC works with Covid19 patients they will file the IND in the US in the coming weeks (July most likely), while still moving forward with the original trials in Romania, so the data from the trials in Romania will be used alongside/with the US trials to move them along faster. The reason the FDA recommended DFFN to work with Gilead's remdesivir out of the gate is because they recognize the potential of TSC for being widely used, SAME AS remdesivir, and there is a need to ensure there are no dangerous interactions when both drugs are used at the same time in patients. JUST THINK ABOUT HOW POWERFUL OF A STATEMENT for the potential use of TSC that is...I keep seeing in YouTube day traders calling their increased positions with DFFN and the 20/30% pop that is coming soon... This is so much more than that, once the slow climb to $5 is reached, then the hedge funds will be allowed to jump in and the frenzied buying will start, pushing the stock higher and higher...Traders will make their easy 20-30%'s along the way of course, but will miss out on the long and most financially rewarding path this company has in-store for its shareholders that have been here since $1."
"I laugh when I read statements here that say, this stock can't gain even in a Green Market Day. Well, this stock is not held by Institutional investors so it has not tie to the general market trends. It just shows me who not to read posts from because those people are amateur's and uninformed dabblers. Once this stock does get it's first institutional invertor it will double easily that same day. Can you imagine a ten million dollar institutional investment which is a small investment for them. Then the stock becomes in the spotlight to other investors once even on institution buys in. The only institutional investors today are those that bought at a discount to provide cash reserves for the trials. This company has never had any sales of any products ever. So institutions are quietly looking until the end of Q2 2b results come in. That is the tipping point one way or the other for this stock. I've been in for a quarter mill for nearly 6 months now and I will be dialing into the annual meeting, voted my proxies and ignore those uninformed short sellers playin' head games with some of you. Stay strong through August when the 2b results are formally released from the Q2 2b trials."
I asked Mr Kalergis about the Iranian trials and this is his response:We’ve been aware of Iranian interest and purported availability of “TSC” from other sources for some time and continue to monitor the situation.
"No worries on SP. As long as you are holding the next two weeks (and hopefully much longer), we are almost guaranteed to shoot up. The volume and interest will pickup as we get through this week and especially into next week. That will push up the SP. How the market will react when the dosing has begun this month is anyone's guess. But you see how similar announcements has effected similar stocks at the same stage. I am very confident and excited."
after watching CBS this morning not only do we need dffn to be successful the world needs them to be successful also. I don't think people realize how important it is for them to be successful because of the lasting damage done by ventilators and lack of oxygen to major organs. People are coming out of the hospitals with lasting in most cases permanent damage where they'll never be the same.this could not only be a stock of a lifetime it could be epic life-saving altering drug for the world I know that sounds crazy but it's a fact
"Please read carefully their press release.It is the fact. I mean the news will come out at least by next week.Stock always up and down. It is truth. If you want to sell, please do it. Or hold on.1. Dosing later this month(July).""The lead-in will test TSC in 24 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the Romanian National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). Diffusion expects to begin dosing in this trial later this month""2. Read out by Q3(at least Sept.) this year""The Company expects this trial to read-out by the end of Q3 2020.""3. Phase 2b trials begins right after good results from Phase 1b on Sept. this year""Assuming positive results for the lead-in trial, Diffusion plans to begin two Phase 2b trials – one in the U.S. and one at the NIID – which are expected to be conducted more or less in parallel, following regulatory approvals.""4. Phase 2b data expected by Q1 and Q2 2021. ""Data from the Romanian and U.S. Phase 2b trials are targeted for Q1 and Q2 2021, respectively.""As you know, the result will take some times but stock price usually reflects the success. That is, now is the time to invest to DFFN. If you sell, it is tooooooooo late or loss.Stay long and be patient."
I heard about DFFN the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"I am going to quote Michael on something he has said a few times as I see it as what is coming. This is going to move out of nowhere ""like a thief in the night"" when we least expect it. It will be impossible to time. We are all waiting on a PR that may or may not happen soon. I am hoping we get some kind of update, but realistically that will not happen as it is not the company policy. They release a PR on newsworthy/milestone events. It is not unlike most legitimate biotech companies. Management has no reason to 'pump and dump' this stock. They know they have something very special that is working as planned. They are in no hurry to artificially inflate the stock price. One day, and maybe one day very soon, this stock will skyrocket and it very well will happen without any PR. We are all going to be scratching our heads asking 'what is going on?'. PR will come soon after. Something this big will very likely leak before official news hits. Could be weeks before. So get in and buckle up as it may be too late at any moment."
"I found this post on stock wits, this is from the user swimmingit so all credit to him. He emailed David pretty much around getting an update and I listed David’s response below.“Dear Justin:Thank you for your note. Diffusion strictly follows SEC guidelines as to press releases. That means we only issues press releases when we have newsworthy material event. Not all biotechs follow these rules, but they are skating on thin ice and may pay the price in the long run with the sec.The last press release contains all the pertinent information to date. When anything material and news worthy (good or bad) occurs, we will issue a new press release. But that doesn’t mean nothing is happening! In fact, the Diffusion team is mobilized 24/7 to co-coordinate all the moving parts of a new international clinical development program for newly emergent pandemic. But “behind the scenes” activity, no matter how vital, does not rise to the materiality/newsworthy standard for a press release.Hang in there! Very best regards,David K”Is he saying “hang in there” because we about to be rich!?"
Make sure to average this down before it jumps
At least dffn has had buyers in the past week with sp creeping up. Dont get me wrong we have fallen a lot in the past few months so sp small increase in past week is a pittance but nice to see some sp love for a change.
"Earnest, there is no blaming Cobuzzi. The current team is much better suited to make Diffusion into a real producing active biotech company then the previous. The Romanian trials were all about collecting data. They never intended them to continue. They used Covid to speed this kind of trial through and get results. They accomplished what they wanted, but I unfortunately it wasn’t exciting enough for investors. Many dreamed way too big. I too was hoping for much more. They moved into current trials to continue to gather data and I am hopeful that after this year they will have enough proof to partner up with someone to help them get to the next level. What will happen until then is no doubt worrisome. A reverse split is my only real scare as that will no doubt hurt the stock. I think they have a special drug that will one day prove to be very profitable. Just not sure the path and how long it will take. Been holding for well over a year. Accumulated over and over. At one time was more knowledgeable then almost anyone on the company. However, I have taken a step back and will now hope for the best. No reason to sell at this price as I still think the upside (especially from here) is huge compared to the risk. Good luck longs."
As info.KryantCapital from stocktwits/dffnBullish1m$DFFN So now that I've clarified what this PROSPECTUS FOR EXERCISING OLD WARRANTS is... Let's all just hold on to the facts. 1. Some people are still confused about whether FDA has approved our trials. They have not. They gave us an accelerated response which was brilliant. The FDA wanted DFFN to go even further with our trials (very rare) and even suggested that we partner with GILD for trials with Remdesivir (the drug that Dr. Fauci keeps mentioning). Just imagine the PR when a partnership with GILD (massive biotech company) is announced. 2. FDA approval for trials will definitely happen in June. DFFN is formalizing their final plans for submission.3. German partner ARENSIA and Romania National Institute of Infectious Diseases will be approving trials in early June (I think next week) and will start human trials right away.4. Nasdaq compliance will be released next week.SO MANY PRs. WHY YOU ALL HAD TO SELL ON A PROSPECTUS :'( Really feeling sad for those who panic sold.
"The immediate news will be start of trials with Remdesivir as suggested by FDA and since Remdesivir is used to shorten the recovery of moderately ill covid19 patients the chance of recovery is great and TSC will be icing on the cake with improvement in oxygen supply, hopefully the great news will lift us to new highs"
"“We are grateful for the FDA’s guidance. Incorporating their views into the Romanian arm of the program will delay the program start by just a few weeks, yet should have no material impact on overall program timelines.”The stock drops over 10% for this??. But what really baffles me is people bailed at this price. People who were excited for these trials. You sellers make no sense and are going to miss out. I bought more today at $1.22 and still think I got a steal."
"Shorts have been right the last few weeks. I for one never thought we would see these levels again. Congrats. But the momentum is going to change. Might be today, might be in a week or two, but trust me, it will change. So enjoy your moment, but if you are smart, buy back your shares soon. These levels do not make sense and once it moves, your profits will disappear, just as us longs saw it happen. Sell high, Buy low. We are low!"
THIS COMPANY IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD IN AMERICA (NOT INCLUDING MY DAD).
"I cannot emphasis how much upside potential diffusion pharmaceuticals has. Let me start off by saying the mean target price is $2.75. I was listening to Bloomberg radio today and they stated how the hospitals were running out of oxygen to treat the Covid patients (the investor in me thought demand for oxygen increases I need to find a medical O2 supplier) I couldn’t find any I thought were of value. I then came across DFFN, they have a treatment called TSC (look at their website for the science behind it) in the pipeline but with Oxygen rapidly depleting in the US I’m sure this will be getting pushed through for use. Invest at your own risk but if tsc gets approved for covid use then the 243% upside will be hit in next to no time."
"“We believe that filing our international clinical development plan as part of the IND is our best path to advance TSC as a new treatment to help boost low oxygen levels and alter the downward spiral in COVID-19,” said David Kalergis, chief executive officer of Diffusion. “We expect this plan to allow dosing of the first patient in July”"
"Read the Prospectus. This is the one paragraph that I would like some clarification:On May 6, 2020, we entered into a warrant exercise agreement with an existing accredited investor to exercise certain outstanding warrants (the “Exercise”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock having an exercise price of $0.35 per share. All 5,000,000 shares of common stock issued upon the Exercise are registered pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-234234). In consideration for the immediate exercise of the warrants for cash and $0.125 per each share being exercised, the exercising investor received new unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “Investor Warrants”) in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Investor Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance at an exercise price of $0.5263 per share and have a term of exercise equal to five and one-half years until November 8, 2025. In connection with the Exercise, we issued to the placement agent (or its designees) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 250,000 shares of our common stock (the “Placement Agent Exercise Warrants,” and together with the Investor Warrants, the “May 2020 Exercise Warrants”). The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price of $0.5938 per share and otherwise have identical terms to the Investor Warrants."
"The new addition of well known and veteran management executive proves to the investment public that this Company is serious in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic. “SAVE LIVES NOW” must be the focus of every bio-tech as well as all other companies in this sector and DFFN has succeeded in bringing together all their resources to focus just on their first in class drug against Covid-19. When savy investors come to know more about this company with their great mission and the strong management team and also with enough capital and low float, I expect more institutional and big time investors will come on board pushing PPS to higher levels. I expect more volume and big bounce today which could put the PPS on a uptrend for the rest of the week. Potential news on any good catalysts could explode PPS and good days and weeks are ahead of us. GLTA."
"Proposal No. 3 – Approval of an amendment to the Charter to effect a reverse stock split of the shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a ratio of not less than 1-to-2 and not greater than 1-to-20, with the exact ratio and effective time of the reverse stock split to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors, if at all. Proposal No. 3 required the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote on the matter either virtually or by proxy. Proposal No. 3 DID NOT RECEIVE THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF VOTES FOR APPROVAL AT THE ANNUAL MEETING. Nothing to worry about."
"What news is everyone expecting? IND Approval? I believe the company was pretty clear spelling out timelines for receiving data, correct? Wasn't it not long ago that everyone was waiting for some type of Romania approval? How did that work out? Did we ever get it? I don't believe we did,, but we did get information for a revised International IND that nixed the original plan. Why wasn't that discussed in more detail? Was it because the new International IND filing is better then what they planned?How long does IND approval take?30 daysThe IND becomes effective 30 days after the stated FDA receipt date unless the FDA sends notification otherwise. The FDA generally does not send a letter notifying the sponsor-investigator of approval. Studies may begin after the 30-day interval, if the FDA does not notify the investigator otherwise.So again, what news is everyone expecting? Most people here believe that 'TSC' is going to be effective and successful. If not, why are you here. I believe that Diffusion Pharmaceuticals knows that it will be successful."
"Do you think dffn is needed?Stroke costs the United States an estimated $34 billion each year.

"they have raised funds, cut costs, have been straightforward about their development plans and total share count. they have even stated that they believe a realistic valuation is 1.5$ per share. I really like the transparency and the management team as a whole. when they find a suitable partner they should jump to that 1.5 range"
"Just emailed company for any insight regarding the Romanian trial approvals to begin. Last release indicated a seven working day approval process, which we are well past. Will advise if I receive anything of consequence back."
"Putting in a good team. They must know something. And love this quote ""I believe Diffusion is poised to make an important difference in treating hypoxia and related medical conditions. I am thrilled to join the Diffusion team and look forward to playing a part in the Company's future, as we work to establish TSC as an important compound for better outcomes for patients afflicted with COVID-19 and, in time, other hypoxic conditions,"" said Mr. Elder"
"Finally, do not get discouraged if this news does not do too much to the stock price. I am happy getting back over $1.00 and pushing upwards from there. Maybe we will get new investors and get much higher. The big news will come in a few weeks when the results of this trial are done. Then we have some data. With good positive data, anything is possible."
"Good morning all. We do not expect any news (especially Thanksgiving week) for another few weeks so without catalyst it will be hard to move stock price. But as we get closer to the next promised update in January, we hopefully will get some upward momentum in December. These trials will provide the company with so much important data. They are considering boosting the dosing levels to higher amounts then originally planned which is great news as it has obviously been tolerated well by patients. There was some leaked news from Romania that patients are responding very well to the TSC treatments (you can find that article on the DFFN Shareholders Facebook page). The company has shifted there attention to this Hypoxia treatment. The obvious reason would be they too are liking what they are seeing from these trials. I truly believe the company knows they have something special and are doing everything very methodically to get the trials done correctly for full worldwide approvals. Good Luck!"
"What is everybody's average buy? I have purchased in order at $0.58, $0.53, $1.04 and yesterday at $1.24My average price per share is $0.84"
"Press conference was like watching an old episode of FBI just the facts ma'am just the facts. I almost get a feeling they're not saying everything that's going on. I said this a while ago and still believe it to be true that big pharmer will be watching this very closely and make a move as soon as something is done. I wouldn't be surprised if something is going on behind the scenes as we talk. I just hope they give the stockholders a chance to let the stock run so they would be rewarded. I still believe all the moves that have been made weren't made for the hell of it. They didn't need Jane to come in and change the window dressings they brought her hear for her expertise in growth and expansion. If you watch the shorting closely some days it's over 40%, that means that all the rest of the volume is people buying and holding. That's been going on for a while so that means the float is being bought up. I hope to see the volume pick up from institutional buying that would make me very happy because obviously they know more than I do. So let's hope they get somebody that knows how to give a news conference when something big happens lol until then I will be watching closely. Let's hope I'm right.DFFN is needed asap by the world.."
Patients’ abilities to perform their daily activities as measured by Karnofsky performance scores increased from the baseline following completion of high dose treatment with TSC. Investigators have also reported instances of inoperable GBM patients treated with the higher dose TSC regimen leaving hospice or returning to work after treatment in the open-label portion of the study.
"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Feb. 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (DFFN) (“Diffusion” or “the Company”), a cutting-edge biotechnology company developing new treatments for life-threatening medical conditions by improving the body’s ability to bring oxygen to the areas where it is needed most, today announced that it has been granted Patent Number EP2540696 B1 from the European Patent Office. This patent relates to pharmaceutical compositions of trans sodium crocetinate (“TSC”) and a cyclodextrin for use in therapy. Specifically claimed are TSC compositions are for use in conjunction with radiation or chemotherapy. Secondary claims relate to various compositions of TSC.“The intellectual property described under our newly-granted European patent is quite broad and provides strong protection for our lead compound TSC,” said"
"5 green days in a row and 3 of them with large gains. We closed at almost the high today. That $1.50 wall was brutal and was not going to budge. This is by far are best day. Not just the stock price, but we had one of our highest percent gains, we tested new highs, and we closed very close to that high. All of this coming about with no news and just slightly higher than average volume. We are going to get news, we are going to get 10x volume, we are going to hit it out of the park. Hold tight. We have a lot more coming!"
Solid close. Regain NASDAQ compliance announcement should be in a day or two. Longs will be rewarded.This is the same pattern with MARK couple of days ago. They announced NASDAQ compliance 2 days after and the stock literally doubled from $1.80 to $3.50 in 2-3 trading days. I've made $48K in less than a week time. That was the most I've ever made trading a position in the past 30 years....... and they have nothing going for them like DFFN ..........so hang on tight longs.
Today an S8 filing was done to make sure dffn employees can benefit from the coming share price increase.
"Got to say that the week ended pretty weak with the stock trending back down after a nice run up on Monday to over 1$. Not to pleased here when it appeared to be picking up momentum and heading back to where it should really be trading around 1.10-1.20. News drives these stocks and lack of it tends to bring out the impatience factor many ppl here possess and thus the selling continues to thwart the momentum that we should be realizing at this point. All you impatient, short term penny flippers and newbie investors who are in this stock to make only a couple of bucks please just sell and move on so those of us here that see the big picture can enjoy the huge rewards coming when the trial results are announced and the big institutional money starts to come into the stock and drives this where we are trading in dollars and not mere pennies any longer. If you don’t believe this stock can be 20-30$ or higher then you really should take your money and go somewhere else. You absolutely must have patience and belief to be a winner!"
Very encouraging find. I did some research about the article Michael posted this morning. I will post it again here. Arnesia announced the approval and initiation of 2 novel drugs trials. Guess what those two drugs are? Our very own TSC and the other being Remdesivir. What a beautiful combination. You ask how I know? Research. I am sure we will be hearing an official announcement early next week. This is big guys. Very big. https://www.arensia-em.com/news-29-first-two-covid-19-trials-approved-in-moldova-with-priority-review
