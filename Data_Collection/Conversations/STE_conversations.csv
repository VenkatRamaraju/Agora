looks it will open same close and gap is gone but I still think this will test lows in 160 being it missed the EPS estimate as well as revenue
"I have owned STERIS since 1993. What a wonderful stock to own! Two, 2 for 1 splits and a rise in original per share basis of over 100 fold. Should have bought more when it was $10 +/-. Cannot believe more people don't show their love for this stock!!"

I have held STE since it was STRL (around 1994). It has done very nicely for me and continues as a consistent performer. Good mix of products and has a significant “moat” for much of its business. I admit to not following it very closely since it is one of my buy and forget holdings.
"Very good earnings, and this is barely moving. Gotta love Wall Street. Smh."
What time is earnings
I am new to this stock ....is it too late to get in .. There is huge gap in ask and bid price
"Suppose I'm riding this one solo. Perhaps one of the top 10 Covid-19 plays out there. Ready to report the best upcoming quarters in history. By the way, the next report will be mind blowing. Love talking to myself. Good luck self."
