"Very good earnings, and this is barely moving. Gotta love Wall Street. Smh."
looks it will open same close and gap is gone but I still think this will test lows in 160 being it missed the EPS estimate as well as revenue
I have held STE since it was STRL (around 1994). It has done very nicely for me and continues as a consistent performer. Good mix of products and has a significant “moat” for much of its business. I admit to not following it very closely since it is one of my buy and forget holdings.
