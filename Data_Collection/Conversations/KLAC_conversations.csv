"That 's right, same as GOOGL yesterday e/r it even was down a little, but then as soon investors digested the great e/r, it rocketed up 7% and higher on next day, today date....I agreed with the others that buy now and hold is GOLD !"
"Saw the Cramer bit on semi cap eqpt. He was very positive towards the sector, saying this was going to grow and grow, as opposed to creating excess capacity then taking a hit when overcapacity happens. His expectation is the digitization of pretty much everything is not so much a trend, it is the way of the world. And it'll continue for a long time. Which, to be blunt, is pretty much saying what I've been saying up here, too. So many things demand chips these days, and the need for compute is increasing exponentially. Just look at vehicles, they'll need the equivalent of 2 computers to handle autonomous driving (the need for redundancy is essential given the vehicle is making all the choices). That'll be 4x the chip count now. For reasons which were pretty weak, he stated a preference for $LRCX over $AMAT, $ASML and $KLAC. But clearly, he was blessing the sector as much as any one stock."
$TXN also (along with $INTC) announced enormous capacity expansion plans for 2022. Good for WFE again.
"HUGE UPGRADES BY TOMORROW, AND THEN IT 'LL ROCKET UP IN THE PRE-TRADING FOR SURE DUE TO TODAY 'S GREAT E/R"
they are even talking about 2023 being a growth year for them again on the conference call. Why there was a correction in price here at all?
cool I have accepted half of gains at 380. it is a long term winner but you don't see 13% spike in here every day.
"NO WONDER WITH KLAC 'S EXPLOSIVE EARNING, ALL SECTORS LIKE AMAT, LRCX ARE ALL UP HUGE IN AFTER HOURS TODAY ....LOADING UP MORE... AND MORE.... BEFORE TOO LATE TOMORROW AS IT 'LL BE SKY ROCKET IN THE OPENING HOURS"
"Same as last e/r on 07/29/2021, on 07/30/2021 after went up 11%, it stablize at least at above 8% and stay the same to the end of the day at 4:00PM EST.Buy more on DIP ( bottom ~$354)...."
Bingo !
"yup ! HERE WE GO BIG AGAIN, SAME VERY GOOD EARNING REPORT AS LAST TIME, SHOULD BE UP 14% THIS TIME AS TOP GUIDANCE !"
"Great earnings report for KLAC, December quarter guidance impressive but conservative, not surprised to see 450 in 3 months, imo."
Next week 's target could be in the range of $390-$420
"How well TER holding up its gain from its latest e/r and up more at the end of every day since then , and should KLAC !!!!Definitely it's a good time today for buying more on DIP for KLAC !!!!I agreed !!!!"
$AMAT has been talking about 60% of growth in their process control. $KLAC has just reported 71% growth in their main equipment category! it continues to strengthen its leadership in metrology. I bet it will be surpass 400$ soon.
"TOP BEAT EARNING REPORT !!!!AT LEAST $380 BY TOMORROW, NEXT STOP THIS WEEK / NEXT WEEK $400."
next stop beyond $375.00. Bought 5215 shares on DIP today !!!
"BUY MORE ON DIP TODAY, I OBSERVED IN ITS HISTORIC CHART SHOWING EVEN ON THE DAY AFTER ITS E/R DAY, WHICH IS 07/30/2021 DESPITE OF NASDAQ PLUNGED -122, IT STILL HELD CONSTANTLY TO 4:00pm EST AT 8.5% UP AND NEXT DAY EVEN UP MORE 10% TOTAL....TODAY NASDAQ UP $170.00 SO IT 'S A BIG PLUS FOR KLAC FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW AS WELL...ALL IT 'LL BE SURE UP TO $390 BY TOMORROW AGAIN...."
just loaded up more shares as huge gain tomorrow is most likely....Bought 3200 shares more....
"Listening to bloomberg... They often mention semi equipment companies $LRCX, $AMAT, $ASML but never $KLAC. Even from daily pre-market you can judge that this company is not well-known. Even though it outperforms them in quarterly growth and forecasts too and analysts are more bullish here than there... I guess we need more time and more outperforming quarters before market notices that metrology is outperforming."
"Same as last time 07/29/2021 e/r , after hours it was up only 2% but then when all investors digested the great e/r, it rocketed up on a very next day moring to 12%...buy more for great profits 12 % tomorrow or higher...."
I see KLAC has much great e/r in compare with TER yesterday e/r !So it will rallies 13% up tomorrow due to its topping Q3 estimates and much better guidance than TER.Just bought more shares in after hours .
"Sure ! Test equipment companies like TER, KLAC will always great e/r after this pandemic or as pandemic goes away soon when more and more vaccines roll out to everyone, plus booster ones as well...more people go to work, from which workers / they need more test equipment to handle massive testing / high test capability at workplace !! And so quarter ahead will be a huge plus for their moving forward earning report !Thus it 's absolutely a great buying on any DIP for a best gain later on !!"
Today growing because of Intel's announcement on significant capex expansion over next 3 years. Confirms growth for WFE market in 2022. $AMAT $KLAC $LRCX $ASML $TER.
Forecast is really great. 9% sequential growth. Looking forward to positive comments for next year in conference call.
