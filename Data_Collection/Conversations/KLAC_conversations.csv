"KLAC is basically already a monopoly, no one else has their advanced inspection capabilities to meet the needs of the sub 10nm fabs being built like hot cakes. This deserves to go higher."
$KLAC Upgraded by KGI Securities Neutral » OutperformInitiates Coverage On Piper Sandler Neutral USD 338
Anybody on this board! Big earnings week this week for KLAC!
8/2/2021--That's pretty aggressive there Berenberg ($470). Not too sure we get there unless that's a 2 year target.
"If it looks, feel, tastes and smells like mid-summer market churn, it is mid-summer market churn which has the appearance in many sectors and price consolidation which is a price correction against time. Most semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks are range bound and have been for a trading range since late April/Early May 2021 with $TXN, $ADI, $AMAT, $LRCX, $AMD, $KLAC and many others as examples. Enjoy your summer and seek buying opportunities near the lower end of the price range bound from early May onward. There is nothing new here just typical summer market action. The demand for semiconductors will only increase with time and that demand curve doesn't appear linear but rather more exponential."
Record revenue growth at higher EPS and profit. One of the best earning reports in this earning season. Easy all time high at $180+ tomorrow regular session or this week.
"@Professional Investor.........KLA beat by $0.17/share with revenue above the updated guidance. This stock is going much higher. You had better be a ""Professional Investor"" and buy some.......or cover that short."
KLAC stock price is way ahead of itself.
Why is stock not moving after hrs
"Once again, AMAT hits the $140 area and gets rejected. Happened in April, in early June, in late June and now again in August. Still think the prospects are terrific, but what could they possibly say in their earnings which would get this thing to breakout?Even the Micron story (memory pricing softening) doesn't really add up. Micron just reported their order filling time is at a record high, 20 weeks, meaning they aren't keeping up with demand. How does 'not keeping up with demand' = 'weakness ahead'? I get a sense the market is wanting to pounce on bad news for $LRCX, $KLAC, $AMAT and others -- as if they want to get ahead of some big downward spiral. But that isn't coming, demand is explosive and huge new markets are still early. 5G phones have barely begun to sell. Autonomous driving is a few years from adding massive new demand. Computational medicine is bigger than almost any chip market ever -- and that's coming, too. The markets can't drive it down too much while the results are stellar. But forward P/E in the mid-teens makes zero sense. Not when the upside is so large. So I expect continued aggressive buybacks and stellar results. And perhaps some day, the fearful will realize that chips are essential to the future, and stop the downward pressure on these excellent companies."
I really love this company. been nothing but a money maker for me and constantly growing revenues!
MM holding down for up day tomorrow. Ex div date 5/14/19 for 75 cents.Holding 1700@$16
"Taiwan Semi ordered $1.2B worth of new equipment from KLA. I don't know why the Yahoo news feed can't keep their information updated. Check MT Newswires. Also ......don't make any of your investment decisions solely on the information you get on your Yahoo news feed, it's INCOMPLETE at best and inaccurate at it's worst."
Historically August is third weakest month for stocks. I'm adding to my long position today. KLAC is down into light volume. Adding below $319.00/share.
KLA stock price target raised to $211 from $191 at Stifel Nicolaus(MarketWatch)6:25 am ETKLA stock price target raised to $235 from $182 at KeyBanc Capital(MarketWatch)
GREAT conference call. No skeletons in the closet. This stock is going higher when the street finally catches on to the great performance.
Warning about weakness in guidance.
"6/9/2021---Deutsche Bank says $375..........maybe, but certainly higher than $350."
There was not even an hint of negative in MU report so why then KLAC and other semi equipment stocks are getting hammered?
"The current decline resembles a similar structure to the decline the company experienced from 02/19/20 to 02/25/20, inclusive, which suggests a potential further decline on 09/10/20 and appreciation from Friday. in the event that the price closes above today's close tomorrow."
Investors looking for any reason to sell after hours. Great numbers.
Seems like I am lucky to buy in AH at 318.2. They gave certainly better guidance than their peers yesterday + buyback is good for their size.
Great company. Great menagement. Great results during a tumultuous period for semi-conductors

"The move in futures came as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 10 basis points to 1.74%, its highest level since January 2020. The 30-year rate also climbed 6 basis points and breached the 2.5% level for the first time since August 2019. Rising bond yields can have an outsized impact on growth stocks as they make their future returns less valuable today."
KLAC is a Money printing machine !
$350 soon
Confirmed the KLAC made efforts to secure talents successfully as business is very successful and to face growing pains. KLAC is a great company and its business is doing fantastically that stock will achieve $250.
WOW!! World wide chip equipment CAPX was supposed to be $70B or just north of that. Then Intel says put me down for $20B????? Chip equipment stocks are gonna soar.
"peeps were sleeping on earnings beat... Bought for $85 after hours , subsequently jumped to $90.25."
"great company, great biz, great earnings, great future.AMAT has $6+billion in share buyback authorization and it is days like today, when it drops despite delivering a brilliant earnings report, that you hope they buy back shares. My guess is that AMAT will double its dividend within the next year. Its earning nearly $2/quarter, it can afford a dividend of nearly $2 per year. I can't rationalize a share price this low. This is among the cheapest high tech stocks in the world, along with $KLAC, $LRCX and a few others who play big in this space. PEG ratio of 0.2?!!!! Forward PE of 15-ish. Strong balance sheet. Huge growth opportunities as AI starts to take hold. And numerous major nations deciding they're under-invested in IC technology. The story couldn't be better and the shares have rarely been cheaper."
Very quiet message board given KLAC's position in the chip shortage and pending growth spurt and huge CAPEX spending. I like that.
"FYI......please do not take the insider sales of shares as a sign that you should sell too. These are ""planned sales"" from back in February NOT an indication that the director/executive thinks the stock has peaked. For instance, the most recent insider sale was at a price of $341 and todays price (4 days later) is $356 so it is not a case of the company executive thinking the price is high. Poor reason to sell your shares."
MS upgrade today (4/26/2021). Earnings on Thursday after the bell.
Bought more when this moved into the $270's on 3/8. Will buy more in that region if it ever gets there again.
A $20 per share price swing in a day (high to low). You MM's & Algo's sure can swing a stock. BTW.....Thank you!
"The theme of 5G is still intact, it may shift some buyers to US manufacturer at a higher price."
"CNBC----Just reported that the bill to spend $52B to expand semiconductor capacity to combat Chinese domination in the chip business just passed the House of Representatives. The bill now goes to the Senate. The Senate will pass this spending bill as it is BIPARTISAN. Companies don't forecast earnings from sources that are not firm. So this money is NOT in their forecast. Chip stocks will go higher once this information is ""digested"" by the market."
KLAC has a long runway. Great company- long term hold
Why the drop today?....
"Saw the Cramer bit on semi cap eqpt. He was very positive towards the sector, saying this was going to grow and grow, as opposed to creating excess capacity then taking a hit when overcapacity happens. His expectation is the digitization of pretty much everything is not so much a trend, it is the way of the world. And it'll continue for a long time. Which, to be blunt, is pretty much saying what I've been saying up here, too. So many things demand chips these days, and the need for compute is increasing exponentially. Just look at vehicles, they'll need the equivalent of 2 computers to handle autonomous driving (the need for redundancy is essential given the vehicle is making all the choices). That'll be 4x the chip count now. For reasons which were pretty weak, he stated a preference for $LRCX over $AMAT, $ASML and $KLAC. But clearly, he was blessing the sector as much as any one stock."
Can we hit $380 tomorrow? Strong momentum in this stock.
I'm in on this dip
4/30/2021......UBS goes to $345 . KeyBanc goes to $369 and upgrades.
"I guess those stories from MT Newswires where they report insiders are making ""significant"" stock sales when this was trading in the $130's doesn't matter much now .........does it. That is your new lesson of the day. Don't trust insider sales reports to help you make buy/sell decisions on ANY stock. To MT Newswires defense they say in every story that ""MT Newswires does not offer investment advice"" (CYA). So basically their NEWS is useless. Doesn't help KLAC investors if they sold at that time."
I'm in today at $341...have buy orders at $323 and $305.
"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
I’m long here
"The offering of ""senior unsecured notes"" today will be used to refinance existing debt and repurchase shares of KLAC according to Moody's Investment Services. Strong financial management from this company is a ""VERY"" good thing."
"The analyst from Steifel just made a very compelling argument . He essentially said that all this conversion to electric cars and automated vehicles is going to require a lot more Semiconductors . We have a ""shortage"" now and the vehicle conversion is just getting started, and it's a world wide conversion. There are currently over 3000 chips in an electric car today. i think the semi-equipment names are underpriced given these ""realities"". I'm kinda hoping for a dip that I can buy LRCX, KLAC, and AMAT."
"I have a feeling that the ORBK acquisition will not get a final approval, or they'll be substantial conditions. If it doesn't go through, this would be great for KLAC, not so much for ORBK."
FYI......if the ex-dividend date is 2/18 you have to own the stock at the market close on 2/17 to get the dividend.
"The downgrade is exactly the sort of thing some analysts have been sitting on. They are all trying to catch the inflection point, when the chip mfg biz goes from under-capacity to meeting capacity to over-capacity. So some will jump to downgrades once they perceive we hit peak under-capacity. The first one to jump is the Susquehanna guy. But here's the thing. Even if he is right that we're around the peak under-capacity, it is not at all obvious we'll get to meeting capacity anytime soon. Let alone go too far and have the chip biz hit over-capacity, which is the point equipment orders will slow/delay. Today we have chip shortages in plenty of places. Many are forecasting it'll take a year to fully catch up. And by then, we'll have 5G phones hitting their major growth window, as 5G becomes more useful. Autonomous driving is a few more years out, but after the 5G cycle peaks, these new vehicles will suck up chips at double the rate of most of today's vehicles. And the trend towards digitization isn't slowing down even a little bit. Indeed, its now the ante for most businesses -- if you don't digitize much of your operation, no one will invest in it. And yeah, computational medicine will soak up chips like nothing else in history because biology is really complicated and the computing horsepower needed to solve things like cancers and autoimmune diseases is staggering. All this isn't to suggest that there will never be another cloudy day for AMAT. But they'll be few and far between. And they won't last long either. Because ship consumption is going to grow enormously and for a long time. And they need $AMAT, $LRCX, $KLAC, $ASML, etc to do this. As for AMAT, you can this set-up for a below market multiple!! Geez ..."
look at celz huge!
"Lack of chips production is now a national security concern.Stimulating production means more production tools such as KLAC, LRCX, AMAT, ASML.All will be used in Intel's new Fabs being built in Chandler, Arizona and Taiwan Semiconductor."
Lets go!
how can it drop like that now? have you heard management comments - their are working full capacity and everything is bought out 1 year ahead now... Certainly we are at the bottom now.
Congrats on shareholders but geez these semi eqt stocks are at nosebleed levels. They're at the front end of the semiconductor cycle and with the semi shortage this is an unusually big cycle and I see no reason the downside of the cycle will not be as ferocious as the upside has been. As a value investor I just watch a stock like this because it's fascinating to observe a world that is totally bizarre from my perspective.
Are there ANY investors on this board? or just day traders?I bought KLAC for $150 in 2017. More than doubled my money in 4 years. Could not be any happier.Does ANYONE grasp the concept anymore??
EXpect div increase to .80/qtr to be announced soon.
"Just remember, the faster the fall, the quicker the bounce back! Great time to pick up the hard hit like $GOOG, $AMZN, $MSFT, $NVDA, $SHOP, $ADBE, $ASML, $PYPL, $LRCX, $KLAC."
Can we see 180 by next week?
I am a buyer at $300..................Great Company. Hope it gets there next week
Up 7%. An excellent way to finish up the week! 
Thinking about a good time taking profits off the table at this all time high before too late...
Wow......my post about the chip shortage keep getting delisted by Yahoo Finance. Has anyone else ever had this happen? What happen to free speech?
FYI.....I just sat in on the AMAT Conference call. ALL of the chip equipment stocks are going much higher. The CEO of AMAT confirmed my belief that the chip business will be strong thru 2022. Most analyst have the cycle peaking after 2Q 2021. They will need to adjust their numbers up.
"Strong earnings report but shares are dropping. This stock should be celebrated and rewarded and should bode well to all the equipment stocks for the semis like AMAT LRCX ext, because most of them them that gave their report did well."
i see trumps tariff taxes are spooking the market...
A question: ASML has mentioned that they will gain alot of metrology market share in the coming years. Will ASML eat KLA lunch?
"When I bought KLAC, I completed my tech portfolio. If you would like to see my 12 semi and 6 semi equip tickers, please click thumb up."
Here comes the big rebound!!! KLAC will close over $ 300.00 today!!! GO KLAC GO!!!
What was the expectations? The stock to go down this much on both revenue and earning beat?
Some internal turmoil within KLAC with major key employees in the management quitting.
Only winners can raise their dividend every year. The next dividend will be $1.05/share.
"Finally, a respectable correction in the technology sector. There are some sweet opportunities today in $NVDA, $LRCX, $AMAT and $KLAC to name just a few. I just started buying mid day and you should too."
"Semiconductor sector is hot! Don't let the intermittent pullbacks sway your positions. Global semiconductor sales are up big. Up 30% yoy and over 3% month to month, according to SIA. Just about all semiconductor and equipment companies are offering strong guidance going forward with no indication of weakness anytime soon. Most claiming they see the shortage lasting through 2022 ($MRVL the most recent). This shortage combined with the global expansion taking place AND the evolution of the industry's super ""cycle"" indicates a strong long term outlook for the industry. Who stands to benefit the most? TSM of course. Along with $ASML with their monopoly on advanced EUV that's in great demand by anyone wanting to compete in producing advanced semiconductors. $AMAT is the most diversified equipment provider. $KLAC is the dominant PDC supplier. MRVL for (5G and Data Center) infrastructure. $LRCX for memory. $ICHR and $UCTT are extreme value plays right now as well that benefit from having the companies listed above as customers. GLTA!"
Let's see what happens after Lam Research reports earnings on Wednesday. GLTA
HAPPY MOMENT as I sold all my postion ...as for sure it'll plunge like a falling rock later....
Market Edge rated KLAC as a buy on Aug. 28th. Research Term rated KLAC as a buy on Aug. 14th.
13.6% off the 52 week high which was ONLY 15 days ago. It's a BUY! I like LRCX even more.
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."
"With a 13 eps and a forward pe of 20, it’s amazing how lackluster this stock has been. Luckily, my investment in amd has helped offset the loss in klac."
KLA reached an all time high at 273.75
Very weird after hour behavior after a great earning report. Does NOT move a single. penny at all! Weird! Buying opportunity before it shoot up tomorrow.
"“Yesterday was a real washout,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “I think we’ll have a recession. It’s just a question of how steep it will be.”"
I have +200% on my call options here already. I did many mistake this year but to rotate from Lam to KLA after Q2 earnings was a solid and rewarding move.
perfect time to buy

"Hey all, look up Chuck Shumer's new legislation referred to as the Endless Frontiers Act. Congress is drafting legislation to better compete with China. Shumer specifically called out the need to expand semi-conductor manufacturing. This is going to be very good for the equipment suppliers."
"KLAC getting some love that it deserves. Outstanding ER reflecting nothing but strength and growth. Nice raise in dividend and incredible share buyback. With a forward PE of only 20 and a PEG just over 1, KLAC showing it has very good upside potential. A nice position to be in at this stage of explosive growth in the semiconductor industry."
Bought 600 shares at 207. Hoping it goes to 250
LOL didn't KLAC recently get a $475 target? I think it's down $50 since the upgrade
Don't understand why the equipment makers aren't being bought up $lrcx $amat $klac
"5 Top Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Stocks for the Global Chip ShortageThe largest semiconductor equipment firms are in for a run higher in 2021.5. KLA Corp.By far the smallest company here, KLA's equipment helps with the fabrication of wafers (the substrate circuits are built on) to packaging (the final step in the manufacturing process in which a chip is encased in a protective layer), as well as electronic device screens. KLA is also the slowest-growing company on this list (revenue was up 9% last quarter), but sales and earnings are pointing higher as the global chip shortage deepens.Despite the tame financial results compared to its peers, KLA is worth a look for income investors. The company's dividend currently yields 1.1% a year, and share repurchases double the effective yield on return of cash to shareholders.Mind the upcycleWhen investing in semiconductor companies, it's important to bear in mind that these are cyclical businesses. Sales are expanding at a fast clip right now, but when the global chip shortage eventually eases, the double-digit percentage advance will also cool off. This can create some wild ups and downs in share price. Be ready for these downturns and have some cash handy to buy the dips.For now, though, equipment enabling the manufacture of chips is a high-growth industry. With no signs of slowing down this year, these semiconductor equipment companies are worth keeping tabs on."
Micron selling off every day..Chip makers bubble bursting...Cycle is over peak..Will you ride it down ?
"May is traditionally the weakest month of the year. The ""sell in May and go away adage"" almost always becomes reality. I have been a trader and investor for decades as have seen this pattern play out yearly. The adage should be ""buy into May weakness and be patient"". May typically feels like an installment of the Purge movie series. I'm adding to various semi and semi equipment stock long positions into weakness. $NVDA $AMAT $KLAC"
"This might be a good company, but its stock is clearly a disaster."
"That ASML report was amazingly good and should help ALL the chip equipment companies (LRCX, AMAT, KLAC)."

Maybe I'll post this for the 2nd time and see if it gets deleted AGAIN. WOW!!! Nice ER!!
"I just brought a large position (for me) today. I plan on holding for many, many years ..."
We will see increased demand for metrology/inspection systems as the industry moves towards 3nm nodes. Smaller dimensions means that smaller defects will impact the chip more. KLAC currently has 62.6% of the metrology inspection marketshare so they stand to benefit the most from this.
Good to short today High. Market big Correction everything go to down today no matter good earning or bad earning KLA $315 will close
"Expecting a great ER tomorrow. Now how the market reacts to it, no clue. But one thing's for certain, this company is healthy financially, growing rapidly, and is undervalued!"
"Listening to bloomberg... They often mention semi equipment companies $LRCX, $AMAT, $ASML but never $KLAC. Even from daily pre-market you can judge that this company is not well-known. Even though it outperforms them in quarterly growth and forecasts too and analysts are more bullish here than there... I guess we need more time and more outperforming quarters before market notices that metrology is outperforming."
"Klac is positioned for forwarding growth, the P/E ratio is low compared to EPS, dilution has dried up near the end of the year. It is just a matter of time with the market's correction before we see the turn up here. IMO. They have strong growth and are positioned to take good market share forward into 2019. IMO."

"Just read the Bloomberg report this morning on the chip shortage issue. Based on this report , the chip shortage issue is in its infancy. I guess I didn't realize that it is a GLOBAL chip shortage. It is also a NATIONAL SECURITY issue. France and Germany are talking about making major investments in new chip manufacture. Even though KLAC is near its all time high I do not think all this news is built in to the current price. This chip capacity and new investment can last for years from now. The picture has changed, and it's not like just anyone has the technology to meet this demand. I'm thinking about adding more even at these new highs."
KLAC is ready to jump and to $250 next month. Business is going very strong for KLAC in Asia. Strong management that they are making sure to reward the talents and those who have made business strong the past years.
"I love KLA, this is a 5G winner real soon!"
Next quarter It will still be better.
KLAC will greatly benefit from the global semiconductor spending and expansion. ANY weaknesses pushing prices lower are great buying opportunities. The massive global spending and demand should play favorably for KLAC's diagnostic and yield management solutions. All semiconductor manufactures need this type of equipment.
AMZN is up huge in after hours with +5%...so it will push the whole NASDAQ even higher tomorrow....it's good for KLAC too with today's e/r outcome pretty good... Should be $350 or higher by tomorrow...
"This is a crazy good company to invest in, but no one is noticing. I am amazed there are no buyers."
Just sold all my position as high caution at this level
KLAC is up 5.13% to 120.83

KLAC was upgraded to a buy on Aug. 14 when the stock was trading around $210 to a higher target price over $230. I think the stock is oversold and it is at a great price to enter or to add more. God bless.
"KLAC crushes earnings!!! KLAC earned an adjusted $2.73 a share on sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter ended June 30. Analysts expected KLA earnings of $2.41 a share on sales of $1.42 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, KLAC earnings were $1.78 a share on sales of $1.26 billion. KLAC will up-gap tomorrow!!! GO KLAC GO!!!"
"Market in a bearish mode, trade war with China is wiping off a significant part of the chip and telcom market. The companies involved find themselves with excess capacity and no other market to turn to. Trump has put the US and China in a loose-loose situation. On top of that, by discarding the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement) he is giving no alternative (tariffs' wise) to companies wanting to make Foreign direct Investments in other pacific countries. Costs rise, revenues fall, not good for stocks."
"New KLAC owner. Sold MOMO and decided to join the KLAC party. I'm in it for the long haul, wish me luck."
"KLAC is breaking out!!! KLAC reports earnings after hours today!!! KLAC will crush the analysts expectations!!! Good luck to all ""longs""!!! GO KLAC GO!!!"

OK.....that's a 10% correction from the 52 week high. It will be turning around soon.
wasn't this stock upgraded with a $475 PT?
"Sorry for those who still holding at this overvalued, as it 'll be soon sink deeply even on the next day !"
FYI.....Citigroup went to $380 today (4/19). I think they will be correct.
MS goes to $364 on KLAC. Just a matter of patience and time my friends.....patience.....and........time.

"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
Bought in December @ $85/share.........not scared at all. Up 40%........down 6% (today 5/7)........no big deal. If this ever hits $100 again I will double down.
$KLACSo both LRCX and KLAC had great earnings and beat expectations and great outlook.So why then they took down LRCX sharply yesterday and down again premarket while KLAC was flat and up huge premarket?This market is insane!
"Well I still see semi's are etting mistreated.....and they were already bargains before this market temper tantrum. Now they are just insanely cheap! Should be a great time to buy. They are going to bounce back up as soon as everyone realizes their concerns about the industry's ""cycle"" is not happening. We are still in the beginning of a decade or more long super cycle. The industry has evolved! $TSM $KLAC $ASML $AMAT $QRVO $UCTT $ICHR $MRVL"
"Congress has just passed federal legislation to provide ""incentives to boost US semiconductor chip manufacturing"". Analyst will need to boost their price targets."
KLAC beat on revenue and earnings again in the 4th Quarter!!! GO KLAC GO!!!
fair value 50-60
I sat on the CC for LRCX. DO NOT sell your shares of KLAC. We are at the beginning of a strong semi equipment investment cycle. It is not a cyclical event. The second half of 2021 will be stronger than the first half and WFE spend is above $75B for 2021.
"Would appreciate some feedback from a NORMAL thread like this one. Currently in ASML - as you know, a competitor of KLAC. For someone like myself who's not in KLAC, what should I know and why should I get in? Also saw some data that the relative value of KLAC is 260+ compared to the 207 price it's at now. I'm big in the semiconductor space have have significant positions in AMD and QCOM - so I'm long regardless. Would appreciate any feedback."
LRCX's slight beat is very encouraging. I'm buying more KLAC first thing tomorrow.
That looks like strong guidance for the next quarter. I would be surprised if this didn't jump tomorrow.
This is going to be a monster of a stock. 5G will be as transformative and electricity in the 1920's and the Internet in the late 80's and early 90's. Get in when the market cap is circa 30 billion. It won't be there for long!!!
just got positive news on Fox Business channel...top chip to buy
I am not sure that the regulators would approve the deal.....but I could see KLAC bought by LRCX or AMAT or even ASML.
$2B in ADDITIONAL stock buyback.......that's an additional 4% of the total float. Strong financials to do that while raising the dividend 17%. Going MUCH higher.
Could be a big correction ahead next week when the fed start tapering policy
"just keeps going up, but haven't seen any news on this, I'm not complaining though!! anyone know why it's been climbing so fast?"
Brokerage firms have given klac higher target pricesBought 800
"KLA Tencor Corporation ( KLAC ) MACD bull crossover, upgraded to strong buy, rising from the bottom."
"KLAC, IMO as like MSFT has some upside potential for the first two quarters this year. Low P/E Ratio, growing margins and gain in market share and flat market cap at the end of the year resulting in some dried up dilution on the basic. I see forward uptrend over the next two quarters and price range by June $118 to $120. IMO. Even with a balance of reaccumulation to the high of last years dilution as their growing margins and market share. SHould be a good start to the new year as it is reflected in reporting the coming reporting. IMO. They keep growing their margins and market share as they have been, we could be in for surprise this year with them. IMO."
Could easily see 90's with a little manipulation
