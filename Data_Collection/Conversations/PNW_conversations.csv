Utilities that avoid issues like nuclear and coal will do well. The future will require significant growth to sustain the conversion from ICE automobiles to EVs. All those charging stations will require a 50% increase nationally in grid capacity over the next 10 years if we are truly going to be an EV economy. PNW is positioned well for the future and is a good buy right now.

Is it because Arizona is going solar why this is being sold off so consistently? All the apartment buildings and condos being built in dtpx and Tempe and Scottsdale are plugged into the grid

yowza- up >22% in < 2.5 months since last big buy. Not too shabby... %^)
Hope PNW can supply enough power with the electric car invasion.
"Electric companies should be considered growth companies. Everything is going electric, cars, trucks, lawnmowers, snow blowers, power tools, in fact, anything with a gasoline or diesel motor will soon be using battery power. Imagine the demand for electricity that PNW is facing and it is happening fast. The price of a share of PNW stock could easily double. That's my thought. Any comments on why this is unrealistic thinking?"
It's terribly hot in PNW territory and PNW makes lots of money cooling things down. So why is the stock down?

All of a sudden utilities are not in vogue? These guys stand to make the best use of solar in the country.

"Lot of Christmas lighting, lot of profits!"
Are we forgetting the demand electric vehicles and robots are just starting to generate? No reason for PNW to go anywhere but up.

I have a feeling PNW will see a pullback now. What yall think? google awe-someSTOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
Why would anyone sell now when an $.81 dividend is only days away. Seems like there should be a buying surge. This is one crazy stock.
Rate case has not been approved yet.
Moving to Phoenix soon my APS electricity bills will be covered by dividends from pnw
Why is a $100 stock selling in the $70s? The demand for their product only grows.
Great earnings but a lousy stock price. This should be headed to $100/share after the earnings announcement this morning.
Ouch!!
dividend up 4 .25 per quarter

Isn't this the time of year when AZ. cranks up their air conditioners and a big jump in electricity demand happens ?Then why isn't PNW moving up instead of down?

"yowza!, up nearly 30% since buy 6 weeks ago, not counting the div. Not too shabby for a ute %^ )"
Adding a few with div yield >4%...
PNW not doing well. But should. Its PE is only 13. DTE has a PE of 18 and sells for $116/share. PNW also has a target of $85/share but is only selling for $72/share.What's wrong here?

"Cash ~$5M, debt ~$5B"
Will the stock split now?
If history is followed we are due for a 4 cent increase in the div
A short time ago PNW was well over $100/share. Now it's only around $70/share with better than expected earnings. Hard to figure this out.
Nice dividend but a lousy share price. Once was $105 per share. Lot of sad investors who bought at that price not long ago.
PNW needs to be launching an aggressive buy back at this level.
A/C running at full capacity in PNW country.
"Dropping like a stone , any reason for that ?"
Will PNW split its stock at $100?
exdiv coming up soon. hopefully we get an announcement soon. waiting for a 4c increase

I move the Phoenix next April. Putting 10grand into this just so I can have back some of the money I pay them in electricity bills each year
Is it because homeowners are going solar? Why is this bleeding?
"TSMC consumed 4.9% of Taiwan's electric in 2019. Taiwan has a population of 23 million. TSMC is coming to Phoenix, AZ. Will this end up with a huge electricity demand?"

Question: With FirstEnergy and Excelon needing to obtain illegal money to support their Nuclear Plants does this mean that PNW should be dwindling Palo Verde and using Solar in a state there is more Sun than it could possibly use?

"PNW serves Phoenix, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, maybe the fastest. Also read they are somehow involved in real estate development which would be another bonus. Yet the stock doesn't reflect that, it doesn't move up, it just goes back and forth. Hard one to figure out."
"Wow this is frustrating, lost all my gains holding on to the last 2% of green. ER might wipe that out too. Smh"
I have been on the verge of buying but am waiting for trend improvement. Any thoughts on the deal with Nikola? Think this has potential as larger revenue stream in the future?
