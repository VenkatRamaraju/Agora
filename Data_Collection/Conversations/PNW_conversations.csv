Nice Zack's article comparing PNW to PEG. Reassuring after loading up heavily on this opportunity.
"Cash $14MM, debts $7.4BB, NEVER"
"Stock should be way higher, for the prices they charge where is all the money going?"
Buying the dip.
Someone give me a good reason not to buy 200 shares this week
AZ regulatory commission announced decision on rates. Commentary from analyst community is not good.
2k people moving into Phoenix each week…these new folks don’t use electricity or technology. They might wildfires and ride horses. Out west life cowboy
Looks like 5 years lows. Got to buy up shares while it’s cheap
"Normally PNW pleasantly surprises us on earning's announcement day. Hopefully, nothing changes."
Is it because homeowners are going solar? Why is this bleeding?
"Wow , over 20,000 shares bought after hours and up a buck . Somebody knows something ."

This is annoying… I’m down 8% after being up 10%. Thought it would take a market crash to bring this down to here…
"Thank you all for this wonderful opportunity to load up on PNW. This is a great utility company located in one of the fastest expanding areas of our country with the green trends only as another tailwind. I liked utilities for the times that market corrections are expected. PNW always seems to go up when the market is surrounded with lots of concern. And we should be very concerned about the next correction that is inevitable with the market currently at all time highs, and lots of negatives (debt ceiling as just one example) to be concerned about. I'll take my 5% dividend while waiting for the next market correction and buying opportunity elsewhere."
"Dropping like a stone , any reason for that ?"
What is going on with PNW?
Where is the dividend announcement for this Fall. Should have been out already.
"Arizona Corporation Commissioners (ACC) decided to approve a significant reduction in potential profits for Arizona Public Service (APS), on Wednesday.The company which currently receives a 10% Return on Equity (ROE), had that number cut to 8.7% by regulators in its latest rate case."
"Okay, so what's the story with PNW this morning?"
with an 8.7% return it should permit a 5% return in div. especially as the capital worth of the company is increased with 3% loans
"PNW serves Phoenix, one of the fastest growing cities in the country, maybe the fastest. Also read they are somehow involved in real estate development which would be another bonus. Yet the stock doesn't reflect that, it doesn't move up, it just goes back and forth. Hard one to figure out."
"Electric companies should be considered growth companies. Everything is going electric, cars, trucks, lawnmowers, snow blowers, power tools, in fact, anything with a gasoline or diesel motor will soon be using battery power. Imagine the demand for electricity that PNW is facing and it is happening fast. The price of a share of PNW stock could easily double. That's my thought. Any comments on why this is unrealistic thinking?"
This type of action is a reminder that we should always have some free cash ready to take advantage! Ridiculously cheap now
"$7.7BB DEBTS, very little cash $14 mm!Way over valued!!!!"

"Got some shares pre-market this am, Oct7, @$70.75. YOC here is almost 4.7%, should be modest div hike next Q. Reasonable PR of 65%, A- credit rating ... works for me! %^)"
Is it because Arizona is going solar why this is being sold off so consistently? All the apartment buildings and condos being built in dtpx and Tempe and Scottsdale are plugged into the grid
"I have been watching this one and PEG, bought PEG before ex-date, still above water on PEG, hope the best for all who have stayed, may be interested in EVA, comes with a K-1 though, just about the same pay-out, been good for me for for over a year now."
"Excuse me. Could anyone tell me when PNW will announce the DIV increase, or should I go screw myself."

"Humm, Waitin' for that ""correction""....not in my utilitues......yet"
Buying 140 shares in my etrade account on Monday. I’ll sell them when Q3 numbers get released then put the proceeds into con Edison and sell that when Q4 numbers get released. From there I’ll either buy gps or ppl or tpic
I'm waiting for $60.00
This is an absolute no-brained buy.
Their revenue/earnings look great though!
Pinnacle West Capital reached a 52 Week low at 64.53
"For those who dont know. APS is a electric company that mainly serves west phoenix. It is for profit. East phoenix is handled by SRP, which is non profit. In general people hate APS but love SRP. I have SRP and am glad I dont live in APS terroritory. APS seems to hike rates more often, it seems every year. The stock is down because they want a 10% profit margin but they are getting pushback because like I said, every year it seems they want a price hike. I cant remember the last time SRP raised my rate. They have been very good to me. So you have to look at the big picture. Everytime APS requests a rate hike it is approved but for a lower amount. This happens every time. They will probably get their rate hike approved and that's all that matters. If you're an investor you should like APS because they like to raise rates and they seem less friendly to the public. Phoenix is one of the hottest real estate markets in the country this is a good electric company to own as usage should go up."
