Almost 12B a year profit.. Time to raise the price target...
Sell on news? Huge volume today. Looks like smart money exit.
CRAMER TOLD ME TO BUY THIS AT $52 ages ago; and I finally listened about a year ago at $42 JUST SOLD and left in 50% of my profit with a 10% stop. THAT MEANS I locked 90% of my profits in. 
What's wrong???
Capital One Financial is down 4.90% to 156.77
I have one question for whoever reads this:What's in your wallet?
opportunity to buy.thanks.
"Baird is now buying COF in client portfolios. When their Analyst issues a sell rating at $225 or higher, then they will be selling in client portfolios. This is what they do and it’s perfectly legal. The average retail investor takes the bait and buys/sells based on Analyst upgrades or downgrades. It’s why the professionals are are better than you."
"Where is the dis-connect, current information?Capital One Financial (COF) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $7.71 per share on revenue of $7.8 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $4.78 per share on revenue of $7.1 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $5.46 per share.Yet they have a recommendation for a nvestors!"
big institution or insider selling.. the only way a stock goes down is because there are big sellers. Don't understand why this stock is going down.
basically just took an opportunity to lower my cost basis.
"AXP pe of 20,, VISA PE of 40..COF is worth double from here."
COF - Zacks 10/28/21 - Buy
Guess everyone going to be using crypto not Con cards…
"Visa and Cap One beat on earnings and revenue, yet are down big. What did I miss? Is there a wing about to fall off the plane?"
COF make more profit than VISA...
Added at $155.67. Right back where we were a few weeks ago.
Stock market will forever show it doesn't make any sense.
This SMASHES earnings and gets annihilated but yet TSLA climbs over a 1000. I don’t get it. But I’m sure as hell buying COF.
how can you down grade a stock with PE of 7 and is crushing earnings unless you want to buy more at a lower price.imo good luck all
