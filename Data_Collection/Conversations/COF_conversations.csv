"=== Enjoy: ""exposure to commodity risk to “essentially zero"" ===> Capital One’s commercial bank “does not engage in speculative derivatives trading” and its normal hedging activity has not changed, the bank spokesperson said on Saturday.The bank enters into hedges with other banks to reduce exposure to commodity risk from its hedges with oil and gas clients, reducing exposure to commodity risk to “essentially zero, and we are subject to no outstanding margin calls,” the spokesperson said."
"Stocks like COF that go to 140, go to 150?"
What's wrong???
"Seems to me, the data breach had no adverse financial impact on card holders. The breach was discovered, the thief caught, and the stolen files recovered without further distribution. Cardholder information was not disclosed beyond the thief stealing the cardholder data, apparently. Anyone know of any fraudulent use of the stolen cardholder information?"
"Getting crushed lately, not really sure whats changed other then sentiment..."
How can the est. return be 37% when the price is already near the Target price? What am I missing?
Ignore the dips and corrections it’s all part of the long term hold. Otherwise take them as buying opportunities! 
$125 million is a whole weeks worth of earnings. No big deal.

"Based on yahoo estimate of -1.68, COF actually beat 2Q expectations. Like others in this sector, assuming economy starts a slowish but steady recovery, the bad news is priced in and this is the trough quarter for this sector. GLA"
It’s time to take gains and sell this one. Massive data breach is not good publicity at all.
Obviously Business Banking is a very small part of their business? They were unable to or unwilling to process PPP loans and every small business owner that I know that has accounts in my area of Queens NY has recently left the bank..I maintain business accts with Average 750k balance and like most others have left the bank due to their complete lack of honest communications with my office. They actually emailed me the day the PPP ran out of money and told us they were ready to start processing the PPP application..We had left the bank and filled PPP with Signature bank the week bf due to a complete lack of honest communications from them......
"COF just crossed the 20, 50, and 200 day MA in one day, might have a lot more to drop."
$VIRT $CME $ICE $IBKR are interesting too. Getting ready to take a bite out of $SAN . gl2a.
Love the reaction to Q1 earnings. We've been waiting for the surge for a long time.
I believe a fair value now for COF should be $214 per share giving it a PE of 14X
Hmmmm I dont see 25?

"The eps this most recent qtr was 7.62. The provision release was about 1.60 of that amount, netting 5.02. The latter amount will be something to consider going forward, rather than the 7.62."

I see many credit card customers paying the minimum payment for months paying high interest rates. Isn’t that more profitable than paying the entire balance every month? I think we are missing the silver lining here. Card customers will fight to pay the minimum just to retain their credit rating at all cost. Outright non payment and bankruptcies will be far less.

"===7/31/2020==$105 price target===>Wolfe Research analyst Bill Carcache initiated coverage of Capital One with an Outperform rating and $105 price target. Carcache has rolled out coverage of mid-cap regional banks at Market Underweight, saying his cautiousness on the group is based on their ""anemic"" top-line growth outlooks in a zero interest rate environment, though he does see some attractive relative value within the group. He started the consumer finance stock group at Market Overweight, based on his view that they will benefit from declining credit headwinds and ""greater top-line torque"" on the path to normalized earnings in 2022"
This company is way undervalued at current levels. Management is handling expenses very well and use of credit cards will continue to rise as economy improves. I look to return to $80 plus in next few weeks.
"Covid restrictions letting up means more travel and Capital One has the best air, hotels, car rental, etc points of them all.look at its steady growth over the past 365 plus days.A nice steady climb of over 170%"
PE of 8. Other banks:PE of 10. MA - PE of 40. V - PE of 30. AMEX - PE of 15.Clearly under-priced. Will be visiting $100+ per share again soon.
"COF is on track for EPS of $12. If that trend continues, COF will trade closer to $120 next year. A sharp rally in early 2019 is likely -- IMHO"
Noticed this is trading at about half tangible book value and I love their technology/mobile platform. Then I read their annual report and see that 33% of the loan portfolio is subprime credit card and auto loans. Not ready to jump in yet.
Are the preferds any good
I recently opened a 360 Bank account and that was my biggest mistake as the Customer Service for the bank does not answer the phone calls.
Capital One Financial reached an all time high at 116.71
"hopefully, 200 after ER.."
This is trading at 50% of its book value? Seems really undervalued since the reserves and reserve build has already been priced in.
"I am in for a week or so now. I think this is the trough quarter for this sector and this is where you buy beaten up stocks with good businesses and just sit patient. Like MattieC said, this is going to be $80-90 and I personally think that happens in the next 12 months. According to yahoo, this is trading at 50% of its tangible book value. This will track towards is book value as sentiment changes and as book value grows from here. This is value investing 101 and its an easy money 30-60% gain from here, just a question of time."
"AXP pe of 20,, VISA PE of 40..COF is worth double from here."
Expecting a nice ER Tuesday. Increased consumer spending and low unemployment. Most likely generated some nice growth. Plus their diversification ahead of the domestic economic improvement likely put them in a position to take significant advantage of it.
Was having a good day until late.
CRAMER TOLD ME TO BUY THIS AT $52 ages ago; and I finally listened about a year ago at $42 JUST SOLD and left in 50% of my profit with a 10% stop. THAT MEANS I locked 90% of my profits in. 
This is a great stock to hold. Will touch 90 by the end of the year.
Good price to enter. Strong team strong future.
Capital One advertising slogan to change immediately to “Who’s in your Wallet!”...
As long term holder of COF it is time to increase the dividend. Payout ratio is way to low.
Wondering the level of losses COF will incur with unemployment at these levels. Credit cards have low priority on strained budgets.
COF-PG reached a new All Time Low at 23.37
The stock at 178 was undervalue. So how can this analyst downgrade it?
aren't they in oil and gas loans?
"So since they were temporarily exempted from registering as a Swap Dealer, I looked up the threshold for when this is required and the number is $8 billion. It sounds like they lost several billion on mark to market on their swap positions. Will definitely impact their earnings next quarter."
This is a buying opportunity. I don't believe this analyst. Great earnings and growth.
"A lot of reports out today that Walmart is talking to Capital One (COF) about taking over their store brand credit cards from Synchrony (SFY). This could be big!Walmart represents over 10 percent of the interest and fees Synchrony earned on loans last year, according to Bloomberg."

"Dear market makers,Thank you for the gift that you are giving us. Using Graham's fair value formula, COF should be close to 162. At 80 and change, you give us longs all a WIDE margin of safety. On top of that, getting paid 1.8 percent while we wait should not be too bad... Wake me up when this hits 120. Again, thanks for the gift ..."
"COF proactively closing thousands of CC accounts for lack of use. Had mine closed, $0 bal, no credit issues, 13 year customer. Just had not not used they card. Never got a heads up, just an email saying account closed. Was told they are closing thousands of accounts simply for ""lack of use"" a part of recent risk mitigation policy. How nervous about loss reserves must they be? I am out. COF Not in my wallet."

"The worst thing is Capital One reputation. Nobody will apply credit card or bank account at capital one, and existing customs may close their accounts. It will stop growing or even negative growing."
Capital One had a great Q4. Looks like we saw a little profit taking and now it looks to continue northward. Congrats to the longs here.
Lookin good for a change.
Cnbc just mentioned. Great entry point here
MA pe is also 40.. DFS looking cheap.Why you buy SQ.?Buy COF or DFS..

Thanks Uncle Rich for restoring the dividend to 0.40 per share!

It's NOT the end of the world. Probably just temporary issue. Most will hang on to their card - Credit is really HARD to come by these days. FREE brand awareness for the card today - WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET ? A lot of consumers almost forget about Capital One card.

Anybody know why COP is pumping
buying opportunity. CEO owes taxes and that is bringing down stock
I can't put my finger on it but something is going on at capital one. There trimming down the workforce and selling some of their non-core businesses. The stock is rising as a result of these actions and I can't help but wonder they're preparing for a sale of some kind. This would be huge news in the banking world of course. Folks who work at capital One have told me there are rumors going around that Amazon may be interested in acquiring them. Now I can't validate this information but I do find it somewhat intriguing. Either way I'm going to hold onto my capital one stock for the time being to see how this plays out. 2018 could be a very interesting year for these guys. Any other thoughts out there on this?
this company might have huge exposure to loan losses as most of the banks will.

When banks set aside provisional losses it is in anticipation for future defaults based on current market conditions. They really did not lose that 3 per share. Banks routinely adjust that number as information is available

Book Value of $109.31 and a PE of 7.89. Super undervalued here.

"Baird is now buying COF in client portfolios. When their Analyst issues a sell rating at $225 or higher, then they will be selling in client portfolios. This is what they do and it’s perfectly legal. The average retail investor takes the bait and buys/sells based on Analyst upgrades or downgrades. It’s why the professionals are are better than you."
Solid investment here with a PE below 10. Great earnings even at these abnormally low interest rates makes COF a good play.

"=== Price Target to $82 from $77 ==> Piper Sandler analyst Kevin Barker raised the firm's price target on Capital One to $82 from $77 and reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares. Management emphasized the importance of sustaining a dividend and specifically outlined they need to earn at least $1.1B to continue with the 10c dividend, Barker tells investors in a post-earnings research note. This would imply Capital One is very close to reaching peak reserve levels, which is a ""strong signal"" that it is positioned to report positive earnings going forward, says the analyst"
easy buy under 60
Customers not paying their debts really works for COF investors. What’s in your portfolio?!
not buying any stocks in this fake market. HOWEVER COF gets my vote for best credit card company! Now go acquire silver prior to hyperinflation!
Overkill. Dividends COULD be reduced. Great buy price.
"EBITDA is $2B Quarterly,,,,,,,,,,,,,Net Income is like $1.3B Quarterly for COF with a Mrkt Cap of $46B for COF! Assume they earn $1.3B quarterly in 2018, then that is $5.2B in the Bank after all expenses so I have been looking somewhere to Park $46B to Earn more than 10% in a year-Just kidding.Why isn't COF above $100/shr?https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COF/financials?p=COF"
"Stocks like COF and AIG are ultimate contrarian investments. Both are selling at 50% of book value. In this market all money is flowing into just a few concentrated stocks AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, MSFT, FB, GOOG, NFLX. Yes they are great companies, but at some point the price you pay is important and overpaying for a stock everyone already owns is a recipe for low future returns. COF is obviously not going to perform well and have strong earning in this environment, but it has the capacity to provide strong earnings when things normalize. Buying a good company when the price and expectations are low should pay off with high future returns."
Don’t fall so soon! I haven’t locked my profits yet!!
"Congrats to COF,for their successful obtainment of cc business with Walmart. It should show-up on COF's bottom line."

"COF-PK price is out of whack with COF preferred J, which provides great arbitrage opportunity.COF-PJ closed at 24#$%$ $1.20 dividend yields 4.84% and its yield to call (June 2025) is 5.02%.COF-PK closed at 25.11. Its $1.175 dividend yields 4.60% and its yield to call (Dec. 2025) is slightly less than 4.6%. The K preferred was recommended in Barron's a few weeks ago which caused an artificial price increase, but for no apparent reason it has not fallen back to fair value. The K preferred should trade at about $24.25 for its yield to be in line with that of the J preferred."
Cof is a very underrated bank. Very good value even at this price . Great Ceo and very well run company . I am a shareholder.
Good time to take profits to more stable stocks like real estate with good reliable dividends. Buying MAA or OHI at today's prices give potential 50% returns and 4%+ yearly dividend.
"load up at 80, its a steal. All the financials that missed rev little bit dropped on ER and rallied to green on the following day after ER. COF is also one of the other stocks like C WFC MS and JPM"
This stock should be higher. Disappointed with board.

"== 06/22/20 = Price Target $105.00 ===> UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom upgraded Capital One to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $105, up from $54. The analyst cites his growing confidence in his net charge-of estimates and loan loss provisions, noting that the firm's revised forecasts call for for stabilizing macroeconomic conditions and peaking levels of unemployment. Wasserstrom adds that Capital One earnings should trough in 2020 and that the stock will regain its median multiple of about 9-times from 6.1-times currently, creating ""substantial upside"" relative to the company's current valuation."
"With everyone going to the cloud, about all you can do to protect yourself is 1) use a smaller bank or credit union not using cloud and 2) get and use cash for your purchases/transactions. Yeah, it's not as convenient as whipping out a credit card, but with cash you don't have to worry about someone getting your card number or making a copy of it. Plus there's no record of everything you do. Amazing to me the that people will give up security for convenience! Once you go through identity theft, you'll think a lot more about how you do transactions."
"==> RBC Capital analyst Jon Arfstrom raised the firm's price target on Capital One to $72 from $58 but keeps a Sector Perform rating on the shares after the company's investor conference update calling for a ""healthy"" Q2 reserve build. The analyst models a $2B reserve build following the update, down from $3.6B in Q1, adding that while the economic environment remains challenging, he sees the overall credit trends remaining ""acceptable"" as forbearance and stimulus create stability in Capital One's asset quality metrics."
