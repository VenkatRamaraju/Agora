The market does not like this merger deal - supposed 12% premium has turned into a 5% loss of value! Better re-negotiate!
Easy come easy go very short term. Don't be afraid to chime in anybody!

Enough of the spammers! How about some real posts! Good reversal day for the banks.
"I started following ""lionstockalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Someone else besides me please chime in that’s not a spammer! I say where in the 8th inning of this small cap bank bull market. Thoughts appreciated! How about some of you Columbia Bank VP’s posting under a fake username?
Over the hump. Looking good!

Oh it’s so wonderful talking to myself buy here right here technically COLB looks good. Regional banks in general look good as they’ve come down. I’m rounding up in the am.
There used to be a handful of small cap bank investors like myself who used to post regularly on BMRC. We all appeared to have a great run despite the 09 onslaught and we all shared great ideas on small cap banks. So I ask who the heck is out there?!

"Valued "" nicely "" but expect a mini run come the merger. Plenty took the cash when CPBO was bought by PCBK. They were unfortunately left in the dust."
