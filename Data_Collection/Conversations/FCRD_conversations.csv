So who is in favor of increasing leverage when they can't make a good loan and the stock is trading at a 30% discount? Management is really in a bubble .

Cooperman should take this over.
"Though I think the excuse was a bit lame, during the last CC management was complaining that their main problem was lack of scale. Terms of this new deal weren't discussed, but KVK adds about 25-30% to their asset base. Let's hope we won't need to hear similar excuses during the November CC, after lots of cheering in August's. More likely in November, they will complain about time and expense to integrate KVK, but make grand promises so far out we'll have forgotten them by the time they're broken. I really think management's heart is in the right place, but they are also sticking to a losing strategy, mostly with other people's money. I feel very conflicted about owning this stock."

Is there anyone following this stock and what do you think about the merger with Eagle Growth?
TCRD NAV last quarter was 11.35. At $8.6 stock price today that represents a 25% discount to NAV.

Putting in a bid $9.51 GTC divi is very appealing.

I'm starting to think that the strategy is to buy all independent investors out at market and then liquidate the fund for a nice 30% upside for them.

"It is time to buy and worry about it later. TCRD just dropped to much, Just put in a big buy order at 8.09 and did not get them all filled, now traded at 8.12. At 8.09, its yield had become a hefty 14.24%. Its NII of 0.31 appears to be able to sustain its current dividend on 0.27 and its recent NAV of 10.23, means it is current traded with about a 21% discount, not great but not too bad.In short, a good risk especially interest rate would continue to rise. I saw similar thing happened with ABDC and CPTA, once they wrote off the bad assets, their NAV started to rise and their prices rose with it. I believe in the next 12 months, most BDCs would outperform the stock market, Of course, you must do your own researches."
Anyone else interested in discussing this catastrophe. Yahoo Message Boards totally useless not that they ever had much to offer.

What's with the name change?
"Can TCRD continue to sustain its dividend (0.27/qtr). We will find out when it announce its next quarter's earnings on March 6, 2019 but one Jan. 2019 article in Seeking Article predicted it would cut dividend. With its almost 16% yield, I have to readily admit that it may be time to take some profit off the table. I sold some today at 6.80 to take profit."
THL merge or close the fund!

wouldn't it be nice if the board personally owned significant amount of shares so they can share the pain?
"Okay, so the Fed would announce another 0.25% rate hike this week after the FOMC meeting )12/18 and 19) but rate hike is good for BDCs' earnings, so why most BDCs dropping like rocks with TCRD dropped 5.61% to its 12-mo low of 6.22? Currently it traded at 6.27, about a 37.9% discount from its recent NAV of 10.10, yet its recent qtr div of 0.27 (NII of 0.26) makes its yield rise to a whopping 17.2%. Just doubled down at 6.22 This is totally unreal. So many good buys today and running of dry powder."

come to me my precious.... just a few more cents...
THL ran for the hills to avoid all the shame in the management off this company.
"The stock price is in a nice UPTREND going into earnings. Favorable economic conditions with the higher interest rates can only have helped the bottom line in the first quarter, imo."

Should've sold into the auction. What a mistake believing in the new ownership. Should've known that keeping the same management would've been the same ...

The holding company should just merge this fund with another one or close it down at book. The management structure does not make sense for 200mm.

"Dismal quarter in a Goldilocks economy. Management continues to destroy value. How shareholder equity can drop by over a buck. while earnings ""almost"" cover dividends is a mystery to me. It's as if the shareholders are running a charity employment program for the financially challenged. Time to find a buyer."
Another quarter another writedown of NAV. Time to merge or liquidate this puppy.

anyone know what's going on with the dividend? Normally they would have announced already for the March dividend
Another disastrous quarter. The only way to stop the losses is to invest in treasuries but then how will they pay themselves. The size of this fund defies logic. Buy the shares back at your book value and close it The investor base does not even trust the marks. Look at the discount to book.
anyone know what is going on with the price? they gonna cut yhe dividend maybe?
