I have the intuition that we are going to see a bounce if Covid numbers get better in China...
Imagine the Poor people who bought at $23 because hedge funds were pumping the stock
YSG is positioned to skyrocket at some point. Keep buying and thank me later
"I may be overthinking this but I wonder if this publication (China Consumer Connections) from Goldman (published today) caused the decline in YSG today. Excerpt on the Chinese beauty market.""Beauty: Weakness continued in cosmetics category on Tmall/Taobao, which is due to both channel diversification and industry deceleration under macro uncertainties and relatively weak consumer sentiment, in our view. Cosmetics yoy decline expanded to -21% in Sep 2021 (vs. single digit decline in Aug 2021), with skincare/color cosmetics declining by 18%/30% yoy. On a quarterly basis, cosmetics sales decreased by 17% in 3Q21, with skincare/color cosmetics declining by 15%/20% respectively. That said, we continue to see a divergence among brands, with leading local players still performing well – Dr. Yu reached a 37% yoy growth, and Proya/Winona both ranked within Top.10 in skincare category in terms of sales. Among brands, Lancome maintained No.1 in skincare; in color cosmetics category, Perfect Diary went back to No.1, followed by Florasis – though both brands saw a yoy sales decline."""
"With Its COO’s departure, there is a high chance of BO close to IPO price. It is a good target to be acquired now for bigger player to expand. Unfortunately, still cannot recover my loss position unless to buy more at the expense of no BO."
Yatsen Holding reached an all time low at 3.22
Ir is dangerous to love a stock too much. Mkt sentiment and one lousy quarter can kill you. Thought $9 was cheap but there seems no end to the bottom. Averaged down too fast n startimg to run out of drypowder..
Brutal
This seems to be the only china stonk that still hasnt found a bottom
Is this company going under or something? Seems like popular domestic cosmetics brands would do well in a growing chinese market with more common prosperity.
One day This will shoot up 30% just like that
Today is  
This stock is really undervalued. It should be at least 4.20+
"There at least 500, 000,000 women in China alone that use make up and hair dye products. There is strong demand for YSG products. The stock will turn around soon, in my opinion."
Sis pick up my order first and we rally
Only a matter of time. More dating more disposable income from families not crippled by education fees more babies allowed....only a matter of time before they explode. I'd personally buy back 50% of the float with existing cash. Take advantage of this artificial assault on consumer goods.
Relentless
Price is dropping on no news. It’s all panic selling and to sell now and hope buy at a higher price. One day this stock will pop few 100% because fundamentally nothing changed since the last earnings report. I understand when people sell on the news but that is not the case here.
Keep dropping price i will continue buying
The yahoo rating on ysg is underperform and sell - not in line with ratings from other institutions. I don’t think we should look or consider the yahoo financial analyst rating.
Finally a good day
"I don’t know, I have this disease of buying to early and holding bags!! Just my luck!!"
Yatsen Holding reached an all time low at 2.84

Dada Group's JDDJ platform entered into partnership with Perfect Diary to roll out one-hour delivery

"So does anyone know why the CEO left the company this year, very early, I mean ysg ipo was 2020..."
This is getting clubbered like a baby seal
This is now trading well below NAV Can’t go wrong with a entry point here
YSG is so far my worst stock in 12 years so far.. It seems this will go to 1 dollar.
This was a hedge fund darling for a while when it was 20. They sold off and now the stock has no support and is easy to short. The metrics look great other than EPS because they are in full growth and expansion mode. Been buying down since 10 with puts.
Today was 
Wow from 10b to 1bnever have a chinese stocks have to check this one I might wana get some later or AH
I don’t know how big of a position I can make this due to it being a Chinese company
"Bottom is in, time to double down at 3.7"
"For those following this company close, do you know what which brand is the one with most sales? How much growth in Perfect Diary last quarter? There must be decent growth there since they attributed the increase profit margin? I think success and growth is will be highly dependent on the success of such ""more expensive"" products.... It seems they are marketing more as a luxury brand-- their adds for this product are quite impressive.."
She is positioning for the climb MO
