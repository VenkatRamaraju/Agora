Look like we have some great action today even the volume is mild. I think we may expect to see a better jump tomorrow to around $18.5 or $19Keep it up!
"This is definitively my biggest mystake since long time ago, that ""/$""$ stock!"
Let the weak hands sell with their losses! Just hold this will for sure recover.
I am sure YSG shares will fall lower because China may ban effeminate men from using makeups
Is YSG a buyout candidate for BABA? Could be interesting? Thoughts?
Why is this stock dropping so much? Does anyone know?
Day's Range 14.12 - 15.8152 Week Range 14.12 - 25.47
gmt8 The cosmetic mkt in China was $8B in 2019 and will grow to $15B in 2024. The Perfect Diary products from YSG are among the top brands in China and also sold in South East Asia.. A factory will open at the end of 2021 in China.
"Gradually, people will slowly take note of this stock. They have so much potential! $30 is a possibility in near future. Cosmetic is one of the great business amongst youngster in far east."

Was gonna double my position this morning but it’s already up 11%
Why is this stock trading so badly. Earnings were above at top line and EPS Adj. NI missed.
not many posts on here. bought a few today and surprisingly up 6%
finally some green
"Greedy buggers. Bid $17.50, Ask $18."
"Ooh, that’s too much of a drop"
"I do think this is one of the best consumer cyclical china stock option that you can consider to add to your portfolio, what you guys think?"
"I bought SNAP at $5 when everyone was bailing the company. I sold at $25 or so. Not a great story, but this has much the same feel just in maskera rather than n0odes."
i'm done with this stock! OUT! no time to lose with that chinese stuff! -54%!
what a strange little stock.
"Man, this is a seriously volatile stock. You can make a fortune on options if you have the stomach."
why is this dropping? i don't understand the reason for this level of volatility.
Numbers are good only up from here
Is this company going under or something? Seems like popular domestic cosmetics brands would do well in a growing chinese market with more common prosperity.
I accidentally stumbled on this today and invested 10K. Let’s hope for the best.
If you look at the 1/23 calls they are actually going up in price. Someone thinks this is going to pop in the next 24 months.
"Bought in at $17.98, too bad I didn’t buy more shares"

What is the price of yatsen
Yatsen Holding is up 8.94% to 6.76
"There is something strange with these Chinese ADR’s. I noticed that, the more you buy, the more they drop!! I wonder why?"
I'm going to dip a toe in today......
tomorrow 21$
Coming Monday it will cross 11!
YSG reached an all time high at 21.22
"Damn, looks like a lot of interest. Bid $16, Ask $17."
They had some interesting insights about YSG on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Wow from 10b to 1bnever have a chinese stocks have to check this one I might wana get some later or AH
Yatsen holding is huge in china
Yatsen Holding is down 9.24% to 5.49
It's not able to sustain high. Might fall below 9 again

"I believe many under-estimate the spending power for cosmetic and skin-care products in China. Many young generations plus working office ladies, plus city women are buying and they only use a reliable platform for this as this is something that cannot go wrong and not allow to accept fake stuff. Yatsen is towards establishing such a platform. Once this is done and complete, they are going to gain sudden increase of demands and traction in sales. This will look like a heavily discounted price now to go in. I foresee potential $50 in coming months."
My thought: 40 Bucks at the end of the year

"Sorry, Ask is $16.50Bid is $15.50"
 i was worried for a bit
Watch out there might be $50 settlement fee on YSG on some trading platform.
flat.... need some green here

"I will wait patiently further. This stock will pop and it is only a matter of time. After the general saga (trigger by Ant Financial) is over in China, most Chinese stock will rise again."
"This was fun between 9 to 11, now at 8, plus up and down 6 to 10% per day it's starting to look manipulated especially with no news to drive any price movement. Doubt makeup company has conspired with the Chinese military unless it's to beautify the army. Going to the front? Don't forget your mascara and mango foundation..."
"I don’t know, I have this disease of buying to early and holding bags!! Just my luck!!"
How far it will drop? 10?
"Bah, no overreaction at all here. The company makes 1B a year and is buying brands with it's stack of cash. Might take a year, but this will be back at 25. Enjoy the drop, I'll load up again at 4.5. Sell your in the money puts people."
"Once the pandemic is over, a lot of painting sale will take place in China, this Chinese ADR will skyrocket. I exited my position at $10.80 last week. I am planning to but tomorrow around $8.60 level."
This stock is really undervalued. It should be at least 4.20+
LOL!!!
"The hipsters and Handbags army is attacking this new, new virus that makes the old old virus look like ebola. In this one you get a runny nose AND feel slightly more effeminate. Primary documents ? Who needs them, those are just numbers, we need good, solid marketing to make decisions. World economy? Who needs it, we have rainbows and Mai Tai and daddy takes care of all that anyway."
"YSG will soon have big investors announcing YSG holdings, then it will rise. It's an old Wall Street trick to add credibility to a new stock - show some of the big guys have large holdings in it."
"shorts still have the momentum because communism hates makeup? whatever, this massive sector sell-off is just another get rich scheme by the larger funds."
This was a hedge fund darling for a while when it was 20. They sold off and now the stock has no support and is easy to short. The metrics look great other than EPS because they are in full growth and expansion mode. Been buying down since 10 with puts.
Shorts are going to keep driving prices down until earnings.
Finally a good day
"It's a shame people dont see it until too late. Loaded up more during pullback, thanks!"
Net loss of 150million!
Amazing! Up 10%?! I am going all-in
"With Its COO’s departure, there is a high chance of BO close to IPO price. It is a good target to be acquired now for bigger player to expand. Unfortunately, still cannot recover my loss position unless to buy more at the expense of no BO."
Yatsen Holding is down 17.47% to 4.82

Baba is affecting all Chinese stock. Stay calm..
Tomorrow it will fall heavily like contextlogic (wish). Expecting very weak and bad earnings
It might overrun its 52-week low tomorrow. Maybe I will have a look at this stinky.
This is great report.The consensus expected loss per ADR shares was (0.39).The reported loss is (0.10).That is a huge beat!
Bid now $16.50
Yatsen Holding is down 10.61% to 6.40
wow...finally green!
"I think this stock has potential downside, more red than green days"
"gmt8 Long term prospect of Ysg is good, but I should have sold imediately after ER. Trading range of 12 to 16 for the next few quarters"
More volume for $12.5 calls. Surely whomever bought it are gonna loose the premium of $25 per contract for sure.
"looks like it has a lot of interests, a massive growth would compensate the loss, and manufacturing would do the jobs too, highly likely to have a spike soon ... DYIR"
What a strange little stock.
Had trouble taking off yesterday
What a great trading stock! You get excellent put and call premiums. look at those 9 and 10 premiums both ways.
No news and it keep going down big. Does anyone knows why?
cant wait til tmr
"Reviewing the data: Investment banks and pension firms sold, but hedge funds either held or increased holdings. Tell you this was too risky for banks, just perfect for hedge fund. Watch out shorties."
"The brand's that Yatsen runs has a strong positive sentiment among users in China and Asia. Their social media marketing techniques are low cost and effective. With covid restrictions completely lifted, and people start taking off their masks. That's when make up is put on and the sales of Perfect Diary goes mooning !!!"
At some point I was selling 5 dollar puts for a dollar and 7.50 pits for 2.50. thanks panic!

$YSG $WIMI $BABA Bigger drop coming tomorrow. Will accelerate all day
Me terribly confused. Nearly a 50% beat across the board and stock drops. I don't care if some owners can sell shares or not. most won't at these ridiculously low prices. I guess I'll start buying more again at 7.

"Unlike many Chinese ADR companies, YSG is controlling its administrative expenses very well. This is a mark of good management.Once the cloud of Covid is lifted and masks are taken off, there is going to be a stampede to buy YSG products."

YSG reached an all time high at 21.88
this better hit at least 21 tomorrow cant hold all those shares forever.
"I may be overthinking this but I wonder if this publication (China Consumer Connections) from Goldman (published today) caused the decline in YSG today. Excerpt on the Chinese beauty market.""Beauty: Weakness continued in cosmetics category on Tmall/Taobao, which is due to both channel diversification and industry deceleration under macro uncertainties and relatively weak consumer sentiment, in our view. Cosmetics yoy decline expanded to -21% in Sep 2021 (vs. single digit decline in Aug 2021), with skincare/color cosmetics declining by 18%/30% yoy. On a quarterly basis, cosmetics sales decreased by 17% in 3Q21, with skincare/color cosmetics declining by 15%/20% respectively. That said, we continue to see a divergence among brands, with leading local players still performing well – Dr. Yu reached a 37% yoy growth, and Proya/Winona both ranked within Top.10 in skincare category in terms of sales. Among brands, Lancome maintained No.1 in skincare; in color cosmetics category, Perfect Diary went back to No.1, followed by Florasis – though both brands saw a yoy sales decline."""

"$YSG $WIMI $NIO $NFLX The fastest time for a stock to rise is that many people are not optimistic about it. Once they are optimistic about it, the price will not move, because those who bought it have bought it, and there is no driving force for it to rise. There are many such examples"
Just wondering how low it will go.
"I seriously quite puzzle by the down price of this? This is one of the potential platform that is going to be exploded high up. The price at this level looks like a Christmas discounted goods...They are already popular in China, unless you are not into them, they will be x5 higher in coming period."
This will somewhat correct itself today

Ir is dangerous to love a stock too much. Mkt sentiment and one lousy quarter can kill you. Thought $9 was cheap but there seems no end to the bottom. Averaged down too fast n startimg to run out of drypowder..
"At the verge of breaking out to previous $18, anytime now. It has to, after staying this level many days.. This will be a Christmas gift for the believers."
This is looking like its going to be huge
"SHorts have taken this stock to the prison showers. Holy moly, This is THE up and coming cosmetic brand in china and they keep making very good acquisitions. With Revlon on the ropes, maybe they buy the name and pump their own pig markers at half the cost into those distribution channels."

"I wonder how this cosmetics company is destabilizing the US military? All US social media companies are used by the authorities to apprehend information. In fact they have made it far easier. And yet the US is shocked by other countries doing the same? C'mon, this is all clearly an economic move to help support US tech abroad rather than protect anyone's rights. GoogFace needs the help, I guess."

"Wow, nearly 20% loss on a revenue beat! Imagine if they were amazon, jump 5% on down revenue."
Love trading this stock. From 9 to 11 and everything in between.
This cosmetic stock maybe a winner in China as the Chinese youth are working hard to adopt western style life style.

I have the intuition that we are going to see a bounce if Covid numbers get better in China...
It looks like American fund managers don't really want to buy any Chinese stocks right now!
What a beginning. Look the total price of the stocks and thei Cap. This will cross 20 in few days/hours
Analysts have been setting unrealistic earnings for all Chinese companies so naturally no company can achieve them. All part of the plan by investment banks to continue the pressure on the prices.
Anyone else have Fidelity? Looks like there will be an foreign transaction fee?
One day This will shoot up 30% just like that

Cleared out long position today. Had to day trade/gamble all morning like a rabid dog to make up losses on this one. It will probably start skyrocketing now.
Did big mistake by buying this junk. Better switch to any big companies
Wow it is going up 8%! So high!
"For those following this company close, do you know what which brand is the one with most sales? How much growth in Perfect Diary last quarter? There must be decent growth there since they attributed the increase profit margin? I think success and growth is will be highly dependent on the success of such ""more expensive"" products.... It seems they are marketing more as a luxury brand-- their adds for this product are quite impressive.."
