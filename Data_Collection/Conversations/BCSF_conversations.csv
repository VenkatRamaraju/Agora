BCSF reached an all time high at $20.13
how are Bain distributions taxed? is this a REIT or are distributions a dividend?
So how do they pay out a dividend that is larger than their earnings? Anyone out there help me to see what I'm missing. Thanks in advance.

"Just bought in a portion today, in what I hope will be a long-term winner. If Bain can continue holding the stock-up with their loans, the divs should be a no brainer in a down economy. Then, I hope to see some good news from future exits from the venture arm to keep a strong cash position on the balance sheet."
can we talk about how bain makes their money off liquidating almost bankrupt companies?
