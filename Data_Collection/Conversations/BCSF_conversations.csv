"Just bought in a portion today, in what I hope will be a long-term winner. If Bain can continue holding the stock-up with their loans, the divs should be a no brainer in a down economy. Then, I hope to see some good news from future exits from the venture arm to keep a strong cash position on the balance sheet."
