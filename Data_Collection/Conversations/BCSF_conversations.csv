"Just bought in a portion today, in what I hope will be a long-term winner. If Bain can continue holding the stock-up with their loans, the divs should be a no brainer in a down economy. Then, I hope to see some good news from future exits from the venture arm to keep a strong cash position on the balance sheet."
Some great things about to happen. Stay tuned 
"anybody has good information about this company.not much media coverage or analysts forecasts..., but damn, good dividend."
