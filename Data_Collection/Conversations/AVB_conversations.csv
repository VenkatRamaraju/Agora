"This is going to sound ridiculous, BUT in some ways you don't want this to go up because with the DRIP on you can accumulate more shares, then in a year or two when REITS are loved again - which will definitely happen eventually- these will rip up a lot and you will have an even bigger return! STOR is very good too, buy em! Longterm buyers only!"
Massive beat. Congrats!!
"Buying more shares of AVB today.Adding to my position in PLD (Warehouse/Flex space Reit,a industry leader with ownership in advanced logistical,and high tech firms which provide essential strategicservices to the e commerce space users). Big Box warehouseshave doubled in value in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Delawarein last 3 years. Lease rates have seen base rentals increase by 40%in last 2 years."
"I hope EQR, AVB, UDR stay depressed so that I can load up. These prices won't last. 0% interest rate environment for next 10+ years, where do you think people are parking their money?"

"AvalonBay management made a brilliant decision in late February issuing $700 million of 10 year notes at 2.3% to prepay their bonds that were maturing in late 2020 and early 2021. This is now one of the few large apartment REITS in excellent financial shape to weather the current crisis, with over $1.5 billion in liquidity and no major debt maturing until 2022. While Q2 of 2020 will be a bad one for earnings, if you are a long term investor this should be a bargain as conditions improve in late 2020 and 2021."
"In 08 this tanked 6months after initial infliction to economy. Covid just hit economy. Wait another 3 months atleast. The health crisis is still unfolding.. when the crisis ends More leases to be broken, rental rate must be cut.. admin expenses will remain and financing costs will increase"
"AVB is not like most REITS with long leases. Apartments have short leases that can be adjusted for inflation and rising interest rates. Renters are pretty sticky as it is not easy to move. I am sure the REIT ETF's will sell across the board as they get redemmed, but AVB will do better than most. Any REIT with a fixed term lease with 1-2% escalators will get squeezed."
"FYI, I do live in an Avalon building in NYC. Since the Covid 19 hit, the management has reduced the rent by about 1/3 and also gives new renters 2 months free rent. There're still currently 60+ vacant apartments in the building. Most of the Avalon buildings are in major cities and I expect next quarter's result would be much worse. Consider this legal insider information. I did long puts and doubled my money already. Am going to short every bounce from now on."
I am a buyer at low 140s. High end Residential apartments and buildings will have minimum COVID-19 impact out of all real estate REITs.
great investment is all I have to SAY it’s up from here never looking back slowly but richer hahah
"Cap rates on luxury apartments was 5 or less. Meaning the the return on investment was 5% measured in cash flow. If just 5 % of your apartment tenants stop rent checks, income then equals overhead. No cash to distribute. Unfortunately, a real possibility. It would not surprise me if distributions cease by June for at least 2 quarters, maybe longer."
Luxury apt space looks pressured in short to medium term... hotel industry will contract and convert properties to rentals. Long term pressure on rental rates in Avalon markets
"In the short term, I expect AVB shares to be volatile as the market reacts to COVID-19 vaccine news and political developments.However, I see the company as a great long-term investment from current valuation levels."
AvalonBay Communities is up 8.86% to 172.94
expensive

Check out the vacancies at Avalon Woodland Hills on Ventura Blvd. in California ! They’re in real trouble out here.Could this be a possible accounting irregularity in the making ?
Weird swings on this one lately.
AvalonBay Communities is down 4.97% to 198.67
"AvalonBay is a blue-chip apartment REIT that i own in my Retirement Portfolio. It has an A-rated balance sheet, resilient fundamentals, high-quality properties, and a perfect track record of uninterrupted dividend payments."
AVB owns apartments I would want to live in.
Occupancy and rent collection is looking a bit weak. Noticed a number of people still moving out of apartments in NY.. this will get rough. Don’t expect normalization until July.
"ER after close today. Do ya feel lucky punk? Well do ya? Going into ER without reducing my position, always like betting red or black at the roulette wheel. This is a long term hold though. In at $133 months ago."
Will be interesting (on the conference call) to hear if low mortgage rates will be the impetus to convert a few properties to for-sale condos. AVB is good at this.

There are still a lot of bad news sitting out there and little good news .1. people moving away from high cost cities2. tech company layoffs. 63% of AVB portfolio rentals are occupied by tech workers.3. further extension of COVID infections will cause more companies to go remote.4. property price decline5. non-payment of rents are likely to cause evictions which will also be delayed due to court issues.
"To improve occupancy offer new tenants a free subscription to Movie Pass tor the length of their lease,it’s cheaper than rent concessions."
"Buying 200 shares here, at 131..."
Successful real estate investors focus on long term and sustainable cash flow. Biggest question now is future of multi family in major urban centers.
"Dear Yahoo, can you please stop the ads for stock letters, books, websites, training courses, manuals etc. Dear people, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! please don't listen to or purchase anything offered (think about it) if they had something that could help u invest would they be selling it here/anywhere? NO! they would b investing, more money in investments than selling information about investments! The experts invest not talk, the peeps talking either have been banned from the industry or are teachers, like in school they can teach you out of a book but rarely/Never will it work in the real world. Remember asking why do i have to learn______if i will never use it? How's the physics class helping you now! investing has nothing to do with numbers, even the so called experts are wrong most of the time which is fine with them b/c they make commissions win/lose! OPM is all u need to know. They're using other people's money."
AvalonBay Communities reached an all time high at 238.18
"Wow if you were holding this for 6 years since 2014, you would have made 0% return"
Can’t pay rent soon
Anyone lives in luxury apts? Atleast 14 units were vacated in my building this week and I’ll probably break my lease too.. rather check out now and check back in at a much lower rent in a few months
"Apartment Rental Collection losses averaged 6/10s of 1% of rental income in 2018 based on the NAA survey. In the last recession, rental collections declined 7% in 2008, 0% in 2009 and 2% in 2010 per the NAA survey. That is down over 10% in three years. Avalon Bay is a first rate company, but their income is tied to employment. With 20% unemployed, their will be a major impact on the company. They other risk that may come into play are the covenants in the contractual debt terms which caps debt to equity and income coverage ratios which may come into play. If they restructure the debt, it will come with a higher price."
AvalonBay Communities reached an all time high at 241.02
Should be 80-90per share given new revenue projections. 130max under most optimistic circumstances with early buy-in anticipation
Looks to me $92.40 would be back the truck up and buy all you can you just never know in nexts weeks massive sell off.
"Outside of metro Washington, DC area AVB has very high risk exposure to outbound migration states: California, New York and New Jersey particularly. With only 3 properties in Texas and 1 in Florida - the countries fastest growing states - they are at high risk for any sort of downturn.As an alternative if you must own a REIT, look at SLGSell"
