Can't believe this has been flat so long but enjoyed the long overdue lift off today. A firing on all 8 company had to be recognized as way undervalued at some point. It is still trading at a 15% discount on the conservative side. IMO
Qiwi also has Visa Branded wallet and ATM. It is at much cheaper valuation with tons of cash
The company and stock have been on a strong run. I when if anyone is eyeing them up for an acquisition

"Global Payments CEO says open to big deals again8:00am ET, 10/11/2021 - ReutersBy David FrenchATLANTA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Global Payments Inc CEO Jeff Sloan said in an interview he would be open to a large acquisition again, two years after acquiring peer TSYS in a $21.5 billion all-stock deal, while continuing to chase small bolt-on purchases to bolster growth.""I certainly see deals as big as TSYS in our future,"" Sloan, who has led the Atlanta-based payments processor since 2013, told Reuters last week.Global Payments, one of the world's biggest providers of transaction services for businesses, complemented its offerings with the acquisition of TSYS, which processes credit card transactions for banks.Sloan said continuing to amass scale in the rapidly-consolidating industry, that is now dominated by e-commerce, was essential.Global Payments' acquisition focus is now on software and other technology-enabled platforms, Sloan said.Software allows Global Payments to capture a larger chunk of revenue in industries where the company already has a strong franchise, such as healthcare, financial institutions and fast casual restaurants, Sloan added.Merging with another large payments company only would be attractive if it gave substantial operations in a geography where Global Payments was not present outside the United States, Sloan said."

Buyout Moneygram Mike Brown. Ria is not as equitable as MGI and MGI has more developed channels. Probably a Board of Directors shake up is needed to get this done.
Will need to acquire to backfill disastrous ATM DCC revenues since March.
