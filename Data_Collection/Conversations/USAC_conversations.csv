"Beat earnings. Reaffirmed guidance, high end of range, divi covered 1.16, business strong, divi sustainable , going to $19 plus...solid covered divi 12%!!"
"Wow, over 3 million shares traded. Who is selling and more importantly, who is buying? Will be $19.50+ in 1 month. Booming."
Something is going on ay USAC. This stock was over $13.50 a share just about 2 weeks ago. Either they're are going to reduce the distribution or or companies that owed them money are going to file for chapter 11 of 7. This is a good little company & will come back. The oil wells that are not shut down will need their services.
"To the long term USAC holders , will USAC provide us K1 form before April 15 or should I just pay my taxes and apply for extension for filing."
Why the sudden 2.86% drop today. Is this just normal behavior? No bad news can be found; still looks like a good long term. Am I missing something?
Hedge fund that formerly controlled USAC has sold all its position. They had to sell for a fund termination date. Now that overhead is gone (fund was the 5 million unit secondary a couple of months ago that knocked us down from $19.50. Should be an easy $3 very shortly.
Talk about a falling knife.
"I own 55,000 shares."
USA Compression Partners is up 6.99% to 16.38
"Dividend announcement this week, should hold steady."
My bet is distribution comes down next quarter...unfortunately....then we re-rate depending on cut
"I found my dividend shares in my account just today, since I choose to auto reinvest into USAC. My brokerage bought the reinvestment share at $9.0, it is going up instantly ! Go ! go!"
This could get crazy shorts are still around and will most certainly need to escape the short squeeze damage tomorrow.
"I think that USAC is rebounding as oil prices increase and drilling activity picks up.The should rise up again to $16/share in the short-term. Great dividend stock paying $2.10 annually. Buy 2,000 shares and you will have a dividend payout of $4,200,Better than a savings account."
The dividend is excellent. If you read the minutes of meetings USAC has a strong hold on the business. Nat Gas is not going away in our lifetime and USAC has an outlook and proven track record dealing with all the concerns in the industry. I am heavy and long USAC. A minimal percentage cut to the dividend is a very small price to pay for a company of this stature. And this will only be done if absolutely necessary to keep the company strong for the future no matter who stands atop the Soapbox. Very well run company and more shareholder friendly than most available. R.
"Now is the time to buy, back north of $18 in 2 mos. Cos. need their compression and can’t survive without it. Overcapacity and overproduction is actually good for these guys."
we are going to be ok
"ET said it may need to ""monetize"" USAC...That means they need to sell their interests...That means their financials are in trouble...Which also means they will be selling USAC at a lower #"
dividend payouts quarterly or monthly?
"Unreal. Must be the former controlling shareholder (did the secondary) selling, but who are the buyers?"
Dividend is declared this week: The date you need to acquire the shares in order to be paid the dividend would be around the 24th. The dividend would be paid around May 8th.
"@ I read the 2nd quarter transcript last night and from what I read it sounds like the worst is over . They now can move forward. So maybe, they can maintain the distribution. I feel that’s very important . I don’t know how other investors feel about it."
bought at 16.60 month ago nearly straight down since and a little up today still ends at low of day...someone either has inside info or is unloading all their shares
Ackerman should acquire through his SPAC?
https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/is-usa-compression-partners-lp-usac-stock-a-smart-value-friday
This could see a 200+% yield
up 167 percent last april and a great dividend i happy just holding this
Distribution coverage was decent however lower numbers in most areas but don’t we just care that they can continue to pay the distribution?
some must beleive they are going to cut the dividend 13.6% and it is going up only one answer dividend cut
While the report is touted as wonderful... things to consider....The class B shares did not pay out this Q... I thought that they would this Q...The distribution coverage is just 1X cash from opps...It will drop below 1 when the Class Bs start to pay...While revenue came in above same Q last year... by a whopping $6 million or so...They had to increase output by about 15% to do so...IF they were to come in at the high range of their 2019 guidance... they would have a P/E of close to 40... higher still when Class Bs convert... (and this aint no mega growth company)On the low end of guidance... P/E is close to 80But those are just the reality pf the facts on the ground... high yield = high risk...And Ill bet that the risk increases further in the current market
"This is a monster dividend , is this sustainable?"
An SA article from Freedom in Retirement issued a sell advice. Frankly I am not too familiar with this writer.
USAC is down 5.07% to $15.36
"Can compression equipment be used to compress oxygen? With the unvaccinated pandemic coming with the new covid 19 on steroids, the delta variant, I reckon a lot of cultists will need oxygen and ventilators."
Is there talk of a distribution cut?
USAC: chart pattern may suggest this stock might be READY to fly OFF
"Archrock announced a merger with Elite Compression, further consolidating the compression sector. Can the value in USAC be ignored much longer? Further consolidation coming."
how long has it been paying 2.10 a year.
USA Compression Partners is down 20.37% to 10.75
USAC is up 16.04% to 6.15
Picked up another 34000 shares yesterday.
After reading the CC transcript... Im left wondering if the cycle has peaked for USAC...That would not be a good thing...DCB.... thats market terminology for dead cat bounce...
"No material debt repayment due until April 2026 and Sept 2027, for a total of $1.45 billion."
These are not market purchases...they are stock option exercises and some even include sales of exercised option stocks back to the company apparently for cash.
Is this a 1099 or K-1 for distribution tax reporting?
Why does yahoo erase posts?
Excellent earnings report today from USAC. Management doing a great job under difficult circumstances. Future looks bright. Stay long and strong. Going much higher.
"Are there UBTI considerations for holding units in IRA or other tax-deferred accounts ??Thanks, in advance, for the help."
ET just may add this little gem to a buy out next year! Buyers moving in for the dividend!
Maybe we see $23-25 this summer as industry consolidation continues
USAC shorts about to get squeezed badly in next few weeks.Some are looking to borrow stock to cover before the next quarter of important ramping progress gets announced. May be crack $20 before the summer is over?!
First trade above $15 since February.
Biden said he wanted to get rid of fossil fuels by 2025. Not sure how he does that but it basically is an open threat to oil & gas industry.
I'm seeing price targets around $20-$21 12 months out.Can these guys maintain their dividend?
"New to USAC, bought a small position 2 weeks ago based on collapse of Oil based supply. Got in before the ex-div, and the fundamentals appear sound, at least until oil spikes and excess gas supply cuts normal pricing again.I think that is 4-6 months off. Opinions? and thank you."
USA Compression Partners is down 19.39% to 6.53
Very quiet board for a stock that is up almost 30% since late December.
Got in at $10.74 yesterday. It was $12.40 on March 6 when Corona got going and the Russians/Saudis were already in their oil war. It can only go up from there imo. I'll be selling at $12.40 soon hopefully?
Company should be doing buybacks
"This dip is ephemeral make your moves while you can.This will be >18 in a week or so.Load up while you can. China is a non-factor for domestic compression. Also artificially low price is b/c it recently went ex-div. Good earnings, utilization and coverage bode well for it over the next 12 mos."
buy all day long at $15.09
"Was a little concerned, but we made it yet another round! All good. My etrade portfolio news doesn't show it yet, but found the press release here on yahoo. Does anyone know of the best websites or service providers that I can get news alerts right when they announce? Thanks"
USAC reached an all time low at 6.02
USAC : looks like a BUY right here
EPD or maybe a KKR energy fund could be a natural buyer???
is the companies dividend in question with the interest rate hikes? I know last earnings report the coverage was 1.07x or something like that
"IMHO there are several parties who might pay the 20% plus premium to take out ET’s ownership including LNG,TPL or private equity firm like KKR. Strong trends and/or deal negotiations could get us to $25 this summer."
"UBS upgrades with $17 target price and views a distribution cut as a positive to improve FCF , balance sheet and liquidity.""Slight Estimate Changes for Current Environment We are slightly lowering our '20 EBITDA estimates 0.6% to reflect a higher 2Q20 based off of curtailment commentary & lower utilization/pricing expected in 2H20.

"So....flip flop to the MAX!!! Now, Biden/Harris are both saying that Joe will NOT ban fracking....That should help USAC, but the question remains: What happens next week, or the week after that????RSH"
dividend declared stays the sameI thought everyone was saying they were cutting it this quarter. I guess stocks are taking it on the chin on fears of a Biden election.
Iv been waiting for some lows to come so I could buy more .
Feel pretty good that distribution is safe. NG price has skyrocketed and no way ET will allow a cut as long as coverage positive. Been great ride regardless
"New member today. This stock I think is under the radar with average daily volume of under 600,000. I like the dividends provided. Good luck everyone"
USAC reached a new 52 Week Low at $14.66
Stock is down--Seeking Alpha Article yesterday
"Some will be happy if they moderate growth for a year, keep paying the distribution, delevarge and watch their stock grind higher as the perceived balance sheet risk reduces."
The dividend payment is labeled 'Other income' on the 'Dividend and capital gains distribution' page on the Vanguard website. Can anybody tell me what that means? Why is this not considered dividend?
Yikes will the distribution gets carved soon? It’s almost thanksgiving. Reminds me of carving turkey.
is this dividend for real? 12%
Good numbers for quarter three.
"even Omar is going to start buying at these levels, a no brainer and if you can get better do it we all know the V or W recovery is coming along with the stock specific rise that occurs every quarter for USAC. They may coincide and produce a hockey stick, sharp rise. Compression is something companies don't get rid of on short-term market blips."
"doesn't take em long to bail out once they get their divvy lined up safe, that's for sure"
"Half of my brain is screaming buy right now...the other half is wondering if some people ""in the know"" have information about the upcoming dividend and that's why the price has dropped recently.......Long term, I think it's a sold buy regardless, just wonder how much more it would drop if they temporarily cut the dividend by 25-50%"
USAC looking strong. ET and SUN reporting after the bell. Should be fun! ET owns SUN and owns half of USAC. Long and strong from $6.78.
Can someone let me know when the dividend for this quarter will be paid? I thought it was August 8th? Thx
What did you guys thing about earnings? Coverage TIGHT but this might be that worst is over in the energy market and lots of upside to come. My assumption is they think the same otherwise they would have cut distribution my 2 cents
lots of insider buying going on right now. Don't miss out on this buying opportunity. Buy the rumor.
i will end this bull market i just have to start buying some stocks like this one and down it goes
Consider that the down turn of last fall/winter was erased... and the recent upturn of the spring/summer has now been erased too...And the shares sit below where they were BEFORE... the leg down last summer...Still think its overvalued... especially since when the class Bs convert... they dont cover the distribution with cash from opps...
"AROC was up on this miserable day for energy / natural gas service companies. And in neatly 2X volume. Research the fundamentals, it customer base & management team ... and you may decide its prospects are VERY good."
Today is ex divy date. Expect a drop.
"I purchased USAC knowing dividend ""could"" be cut...perhaps to as low as $1.50/share. However, that is still a 10% yield. Most of the other MLPs which cut keeping rising. I suspect USAC may do the same. GLTA"
USAC reached a 52 Week low at $12.74

"SA article was a scam, by an anonymous source filled with incorrect data. It was pretty quickly discredited and repudiated by co. mgmt. but a good buying opportunity if you got in there."
Rough day for USAC. I wonder why all the negativity on stock.
USA Compression Partners is up 17.11% to 8.35
The stock was talked down yesterday so some folks could jump in on the cheap prior to the upcoming distribution announcement.
@$15 you're goldendistribution coverage was 1.14x for 4Q19 higher than most expected and should move higher to 1.20x in 1Q20 according to analyst estimates
USAC beat by 2 cents per share!
Might be another good buying opportunity during the inevitable drop after the ex-date
"For now, the SHALE company is not making money with the price of oil drops like this ....In order to make a barrel from shale, it costs $50 / barrel ....I am wondering is USAC can still give out dividend ??? May be sometimes in the future the oil will be going up so USAC will be better ... but for now, it is diving ...."
Just read an article about WTI rising relative to Brent due to increased demand for oil here in the US. Very high shipping costs are also probably a big factor. Sounds like good news for USAC !!!
USAC may hit 13$ next few days or soPick up BLMN tooThese have rising trend........
Market is fricken BULLUSAC is going to be added to Energy tracking INDEXbuy any pullback Don't forget 2$ plus divident USAC pays
Anyone have an idea as to huge drop today?
"Hi All, not sure how many of us follow the thread here. Im long and heavy with USAC, but is anyone here concerned with where this is headed? At some point, I would assume a div cut may come, and was surprised (happily) that it didnt happen last quarter. Any thoughts? I apologize, I cant add a lot based on my experience, but hoping someone more savvy than I can offer some guidance."
Why such a drastic drop?
AROC reported--strong industry fundamentals--should bode well for USAC
"in the next several days is the time to load up on this one. the ex-div selloff is always overdonea solid, well managed company with a leadership position in a fragmented sub-industry."
Is ET selling this? Any ideas out there?
USA Compression Partners is down 5.15% to 12.80
up fast
Should reach 8.75 - 9.00 going into earnings. Stay the course for the run up next week
Even the one pessimistic analyst has a $17 price target. How can she print that today and say she is are underweight???It doesn't make sense.
"Vijay...agreed. Very nice movement today...up over 10%. ET and SUN are reporting on Monday. I anticipate better then expected Q1 numbers on these as well. As you know, ET owns I believe 47% of USAC if memory serves and 100% of SUN. All 3 of these companies will do very well in the long run and all 3 are undervalued. ET will be north of $8.50...possibly $9 next week. Should be fun."
I sure am glad I didn't buy this for 15 a few weeks ago
Chesapeake represented a very small part of their receivables.
Any news on next div for 2021?
"85% of their equity is intangible, stated coverage is 1.15x and interest coverage is 2.66x. NO THANKS!"
27% yield?!
I just bought in for a thousand shares. Let’s see what happens.
USAC reached a new 52 Week Low at $13.86
So today or tomorrow should announce distribution. Anyone expect any changes?
"As per Wood McKenzie - Aug. 14, 2019:USA on a course to be the world’s third largest LNG producer, after Australia and Qatar, by 2020.They'll need compression to get it to these hubs. I love it when USAC dips into the $15/sh range, buy now it won't last long."

Do those morons/crooks at Goldman Sachs still have a sell rating on this stock?
"Wonder if this will drop below $10.00 this month? I know Q3 was projected to be their worst, but I can't see this being a bad long term play at this price"
div is usually declared around the 23rd or 24th of April---look it up
Why has this dropped in the last couple days? I saw no news. Thanks.

Looks like USAC has been paying the same quarterly dividend for at least 5 years. I doubt they will reduce it unless they are forced to. Earnings are trending up and if they can turn a profit in Q3 the dividend should be safe imho.
What was the purpose of exchanging senior notes for notes that expire in the same year at the same rate?

"I think that USAC might breach below 14 and might go all the way down to 12.09. If insiders don't buy a significant amount at those level, like they did in December, it would be a terrible sign.!"
what a surprise buy couple hundred shares of this and straight down it goes

"Moody's Announces Completion Of A Periodic Review Of Ratings Of Usa Compression Partners, LpDow Jones 4/3/20 4:19 PM ET ""....USA Compression Partners, LP's (USAC) B1 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) reflects the large scale of its high-horsepower compression fleet, which ranks the company among the largest third-party providers of domestic natural gas compression services. The rating considers the company's enhanced geographic and customer diversity. Contractual revenues are fee-based, insulating cash flow from commodity price volatility, although 2020 could see some limited utilization weakness.

Declared $0.52 dividend for 3rd quarter.
"All things considered, this was a great earnings report. Management doing a great job under difficult circumstances. Stay long and strong. Going higher."
Why the huge drop today on no news? I feel like going shopping at this price.
A great stock that can weather a downturn and the shorts & big guys stay out of this name and can't manipulate it b/c of the low trading liquidity.This is how the small guy can generate alpha where the large investors can't. At first glance many are scared off by the (well covered) 12% distrib. Co. seems to produce no matter the macro environment.
USAC is up 7.26% to 10.34

"Since the first of January of this year, I have bought 2,000,000 shares."
Great news on the .525 distribution
It's because of interest rates
Excellent reported results seemed better than analyst expected. Next few years look quite attractive and still room for margin improvement from merger. Maybe management and a major deep pocket buyout group (several are doing deals in Texas) will consider joint buyout of ET 40% ownership in next 6 months before 2020-2025 very positive outlook comes into focus?
I would not be surprised if ET acquires USAC fully within the next 4 - 6 month.
by by shorts.
"Any one have any thoughts on where this all goes? Any input appreciated. Been buying down all through this, grabbed a few more shares today, but not sure that's wise. I'm not super experienced as a market investor, so any guidance appreciated. Tks"
Wow. NO one knows anything about this company. I like that because it is booming with the drilling boom and the news and stock price is to come!
Insiders own 48% and Investco owns 17% and buying more?A possible take private deal coming up?Great table cash flow and demand for Natgas and Natgas transportation only going up.

USAC: fund will start LOADING USAC on June 16 and on...
So every few months there is a hack on Seeking Alpha that posts a note that USAC will cut the dividend. He's been wrong 4 times in the last 18 months and keeps posting. Tanks the stock everytime - more of a buying opportunity when he posts.
"I bought this for the dividend income.It looks like USAC's dividend coverage will be about 1.0.Question is, what will their largest shareholder tell them to do with the dividend?"

USAC: the BEST OIL and Energy stock to holdpaying over 2$ dividen
$USAC will present a corporate overview and participate in a series of meetings with members of the investment community. Here is the link for more info http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-business-wire/303069/usa-compression-partners-lp-to-participate-in-2018-mlpa-investor-conference
"Whisper has ER 100% of analysts say usac will beat earnings estimates and will have a price rise on Aug 3. It's estimate is for (.13) My broker's research says earnings estimates are for a high of (.04), an avg (.10), low (.14)"
I hope the shorts can explain how tariffs effect compression cos. On a co. like USAC you need to look beyond macro energy factors that have no material impact on compression. We already know the America is awash in nat gas but that helps not hurts USAC.
"THIS IS FUN! In at $15,02...out at $16.10 and $16...back in at $14.32. Have enough profit I can stay in for dividend declaration and get out with some of my shirt if it is cut or stay for the run-up to the dividend if the dividend is maintained. I don't know if I will hold long term but the ENBL acquisition by ET may be a boost. The article about USAC mentioned in another post can be found here: https://mailchi.mp/transformityresearch.com/platformityinvestingrules-4760850Good luck...have fun"
Distribution of 1.15x in 2Q19 earnings call only goes to 1.06x in 4Q19 according to analysts' estimates and moves up to 1.20x in 1Q20. I wouldn't base my short position on this insignificant and temporary move in coverage from the class B shares. You're likely to get burned badly in the squeeze.
"I was watching Cramer last night and he was interviewing the CEO of $DOW. When asked how long the low price of oil will last, the CEO of $DOW thought about six months. Anything to do with fossil fuel is hated by Wall St. We will have to wait until the companygives us an update."
Fairly positive quarter. I am focusing on their distributable cash flow outlook for 2020 which is $195 to $215 million. This drops their coverage ratio to about 1.0 and they may think of a slight cut in distribution. Even if they distribute $2 in 2020 the shares are undervalued. They are in a good stable business and I am holding on to my investment
It is green today. Dog has his days sometimes.
Getting ready to buy more under 17 love that distribtion
got some at $14.07 and hope I can get some sub-$14 if possible before it moves back up and the macro-environment recovers from the overblown sell-off from Covid-19 in the spring.
JPMorgan out today with positive comments on sector. USAC:We raise our Dec 2021 price target to $16 (from prior $15) based on a multipleapproach. Our 9.0x EV/EBITDA multiple stands above our anchor multiple of 8.0xdue to generally stable business with an improving nat gas outlook.
"this squeeze is tight and going to get much tighter - a very risky stock to shortthis stock keeps the shorts at a huge disadvantage with the float & distribution, plus stable utilization, growth in fragmented bus. & very adept mgmt. team.We're in a very tight short squeeze: tight like AC/DC in 1978 or maybe the guy in Goodfellas who they put his head in a vice (eye)"
Why not just buy $USAC ?Hoping for a Wiselama comment but all views welcomed :)
"So with announcements today, what does his mean?"
"ARTICLE BY DANIEL THURECHT “USA Compression Partners: 13% Yield Suddenly Facing An Imminent Forced Reduction"" ON SEEKING ALPHA ISSUES TODAY"
Just broke out of that wedge formation above 16.14! C'mon USAC I sold my OMP for thee!
I do not believe that the stock market reacts to news good or bad by going positive or negative. I believe the prices on many company stock just are constantly manipulated down using computer algorithm trading in order for hedge funds and shorts to hit buy limit orders and sell stops. I never see prices go up except on large buying by institutions or large investors. The STOCK MARKET IS RIGGED.
"Distribution announced, holding steady at $.525"
In order to expand USAC will need capital. Can they borrow from ET? Banks won't loan until debt coverage is better. USAC cannot issue equity at the current share price.
Earnings expected to be a negative (loss). How can USAC continue to pay out a big dividend when eps continues to be losses ?
ups is running its delivery trucks on natural gas. hellooooo.
Has anyone found any reason for the drop ?
