bought at 16.60 month ago nearly straight down since and a little up today still ends at low of day...someone either has inside info or is unloading all their shares
Surprised it dropped today considering tomorrow is ex dividend.
Haven't bought any of this but thinking about it. How are the dividends taxed? Thanks
The dividend is excellent. If you read the minutes of meetings USAC has a strong hold on the business. Nat Gas is not going away in our lifetime and USAC has an outlook and proven track record dealing with all the concerns in the industry. I am heavy and long USAC. A minimal percentage cut to the dividend is a very small price to pay for a company of this stature. And this will only be done if absolutely necessary to keep the company strong for the future no matter who stands atop the Soapbox. Very well run company and more shareholder friendly than most available. R.
USAC is down 5.01% to 16.67
"Summary:Estimates: Within the compression universe, w e believe USAC possesses the best assets in the best basins (Marcellus/Utica and Permian), superior cash flow stability and better margins relative to peers. How ever, given the constrained balance sheet and uncertain production outlook, w e pref er midstream names w ith dow nstream/end market exposure versus upstream exposure. 2020 Adj.

EBITDA USAC achieved 3Q20 adj EBITDA of $103.9mm, ahead of the JPM/Street median estimates of $98.3mm/$97.9mm, respectively. Low er than expected COGS (-$2.8mm vs JPMe) and cash SG&A (-$1.2mm) drove the beat. Backed by strong YTD results, USAC tightened 2020 adj EBITDA guidance to the high end, now $405mm-$415mm versus the prior $395-$415mm range.Guidance: N/AJPMe : $398mmStreet Median: $393mmStreet Range: $376mm - $417mm Outlook:USAC possesses a quality compression fleet, significant scale, and relatively stable cash flow s w ith considerable large HP exposure. Improving f undamentals and producer positioning in the most economic basins should bode w ell for USAC cash flow s. How ever, w e expect a 2H21/ 2022 uplift and note margins could be under pressure during the first half of 2021. Lastly, w hile w e alw ays appreciated USAC’s prudent approach to capex, w e question the need to maintain distribution despite high leverage and tight coverage.Model:Source: Partnership reports, Bloomberg, J.P.

The dividend payment is labeled 'Other income' on the 'Dividend and capital gains distribution' page on the Vanguard website. Can anybody tell me what that means? Why is this not considered dividend?
"Moody's Announces Completion Of A Periodic Review Of Ratings Of Usa Compression Partners, LpDow Jones 4/3/20 4:19 PM ET ""....USA Compression Partners, LP's (USAC) B1 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) reflects the large scale of its high-horsepower compression fleet, which ranks the company among the largest third-party providers of domestic natural gas compression services. The rating considers the company's enhanced geographic and customer diversity. Contractual revenues are fee-based, insulating cash flow from commodity price volatility, although 2020 could see some limited utilization weakness. USAC incurred substantial increased debt levels to fund a 2018 acquisition which effectively doubled its size, although debt leverage remains in a range appropriate for the partnership's ratings....""This is good news. The market expected much worse"
Feel pretty good that distribution is safe. NG price has skyrocketed and no way ET will allow a cut as long as coverage positive. Been great ride regardless
Excellent reported results seemed better than analyst expected. Next few years look quite attractive and still room for margin improvement from merger. Maybe management and a major deep pocket buyout group (several are doing deals in Texas) will consider joint buyout of ET 40% ownership in next 6 months before 2020-2025 very positive outlook comes into focus?
"No material debt repayment due until April 2026 and Sept 2027, for a total of $1.45 billion."
Looks like USAC has been paying the same quarterly dividend for at least 5 years. I doubt they will reduce it unless they are forced to. Earnings are trending up and if they can turn a profit in Q3 the dividend should be safe imho.
Why the huge drop today on no news? I feel like going shopping at this price.
"All things considered, this was a great earnings report. Management doing a great job under difficult circumstances. Stay long and strong. Going higher."
"For those who thought that the company would cut div- read prior financial statements. Every quarter, the depreciation amount is about $60M which is a ‘non-cash’ expense and this is why the company has at least $60M cash every quarter to distribute. Or, it depreciates $240M per year on $2.3B fixed assets. As the company invests (capex) every quarter even after the distribution, I think $0.53 is the lowest dividend amount per quarter.Just sit on it for 3-5 years and your return on investment will be 2X.As we are facing energy crisis, USAC’s business will be very stable and growing."
Fairly positive quarter. I am focusing on their distributable cash flow outlook for 2020 which is $195 to $215 million. This drops their coverage ratio to about 1.0 and they may think of a slight cut in distribution. Even if they distribute $2 in 2020 the shares are undervalued. They are in a good stable business and I am holding on to my investment
Insiders own 48% and Investco owns 17% and buying more?A possible take private deal coming up?Great table cash flow and demand for Natgas and Natgas transportation only going up.
Love this price - 13% div yield from LP structure aka no corporate taxPutting this stock in Roth IRA will create a free tax dividend income stream
Declared $0.52 dividend for 3rd quarter.
