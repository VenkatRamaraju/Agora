"Too high and too overbought. Way too near its target price of $93.84 to be worth bothering with, time to take profit and sell up before it whipsaws back down again. The CEOs at this firm and a number of big institutions have recently sold off their stock and that was when it was around $89 - $90 a few days ago. This usually sends stock hurling back down again. Sell up now before its too late seriously."
This stock is sitting right at a triple top. 3rd time here since Aug 2017
