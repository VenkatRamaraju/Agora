PACW is the dog of the s/m regional banking stocks. It's stock continues to trail its competitiors and cutting the dividend did not help. Is it deserved? Are it's loses projected to be worse than its peers?
PACW reached a 52 Week low at $34.29
I know a bit just a little bit about the restaurant biz --If you go into a bank for a loan to start a restaurant-you'll have to give a personal guarantee-- these are recourse loans -- It's unlikely that most of their loans will be 100% write offs. They bank will after the borrowers personal assets. Still not good but they won't sink the bank.

With the CFO leaving this company the stock will tank further!
When you go to ceo school the first course you have to take is lying 101. You need to be very good at it to run a company.
Seeing the price bump .....4+% this week. (Hello thumbs down)
"My model indicates that dividend to be cut from $0.60 to $0.30 by next declaration date of May 1, 2020."
"Week away from blowout earnings, then upgrades and pass $50. Woohoo"
"85-90% shares held by institutions, 4 Billion valuation, $41-42 bv, PE below 11 payout ratio under 63% div 6.7% 600 mil in cash, and good earnings. and other banks now have strong stock currency to use. other than the majority of its facilities are located in CA... this is the perfect target to be taken over. and in the meantime.. you can sit back on the dividends and wait."

This is excellent action for PACW. With consolidation happening in the regional banks this one will get bought out at these prices.

"A lot of bashing going on here. Equity/Assets of nearly 12% looks healthy - they took a big non-cash goodwill write down charge - Many regional banks will need to cut dividends given lower visibility on loan book - But the stock is at book value - 20% below book would be better value - but I don't think a regional bank at 1x book, no matter how horrible the pundits make it out to be, is bad value - if fact, with E/Q of 11%, it's great value - Yield curve will steepen as the economy strengthens which will raise net interest income revenue - I wouldn't bet the farm on it but it's good value at this level and on any sell-off - from what I see, regional banks offer some of the best value in the market across the US."
they crushed earnings this quarter
little sellers are taking it down.. amazing
"On January 25, 2020 Columbine Capital UPGRADED PACW from 3 to 2."
PACW is down 14.08% to 19.77
First time buyer. I like the dip and bought
The payout ratio is 62% so the dividend is probably sustainable. The stock is down because the projected earnings for 2020 are 3% lower. I was unable to find the current ratio for this company. Can any one help.
Can I repeat what I said 2 months ago?
PACW is up 5.17% to 38.02

"As always Yahoo Finance doesn't post ALL the stock news. PACW price target was raised at Wedbush today ('11/5/19) from $35 to a new target of $39. Guest they didn't know we are already at $39/share. Good call Wedbush. Still rated ""maintain""."
motley fool just issued anarticle saying PACW is the best ank stock
Falling knife
"PACW has not even announced the ex-dividend date for next dividend yet. May dividend went ex-dividend on 05/19, so August dividend should go ex-div around 08/19. Less than a week away, very poor investor communications from PACW investor relations. Seems fishy."
"Jenny Harrington was on CNBC again this morning saying her 2 regional banks (UMPQ, and PACW) are well positioned for a rebound in 2021 & 2022."
"WOW......who would have thought, regional banks and energy stocks up 5-10% in ONE DAY. That's what i call a shift from growth to value. I gotta wonder how long it will last."
very happy that we have president trump
PACW reached a 52 Week low at 26.51
The dividend is their way of returning capital to us. They really do not want to buy stock back as price to TBV is 1.8. Banks like CIti buy back stock when the stock is trading around BV. Earnings will be up next year and most estimates are for down slightly. Spreads will not tighten. PACW is very cheap again at 10x earnings. I would not be surprised to see them sell to JP Morgan.
FYI....RBC Capital raised PACW price target from $40 to $41 and kept their OUTPERFORM rating on 2/18/2020.
Strong revenue and earnings -- yet stock price is down???
Dividend Every 4 Months Now?
just jumped in at 34.80
"Here is just one angle to think about. In addition to the fiscal and monetary stimulus already enacted the congress is going to do another $400B to help small and medium businesses (smb). The market has priced in a ""high"" degree of loan defaults for many of the banking stocks. Since it looks like the government is providing lots of liquidity/loans, I think the selling of the bank stocks is overdone, the burden won't fall on the banks.We could see a dividend cut but I am OK with that. Cut the dividend in half and it still yields over 7%."

PACW is up 8.64% to 19.37
"We are living in crazy times. Coronavirus is causing major disruptions to everything. Interest rates sharply down, oil prices sharply down, businesses affected downward, and the potential for many deaths from the virus. The Federal Reserve meets next week & will probably cut interest rates by a minimum of 50 basis points. This will reduce all bank profits and all banks will also need to be concerned about defaults on loans. Although the low P/E & high dividend look very attractive, I believe there is a good possibility that the div will be cut & there is more short-term downside to share prices. We'll be fine long term, but who knows how long the current situation will last & how bad it will get? Just too much unknown currently, hard to invest."
PACW beaten to death. Down 57% in past 3 months! Does it deserve it?

"This is what I don't like about PACW. They reported quarterly earnings tonight (10/14/20). No announcement on when they will report. No management presentation or opportunity to ask questions, no comparison of actual vs expected for EPS or revenues. They always seem to have a ""report the earnings in the dark of the night, don't tell anyone it's coming, and then run and hide"". Where is the CEO's assessment of Q4, strategy, vision for the company??? Crazy way to run a company."

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/george-soros-insiders-betting-big-160656768.html
This is crazy. P/E of 5.5 and dividend at today's price of over 11%. Quarterly dividend is around $72 million and free cash flow in the last quarter was around $140 million. The Quartely report in April should help detemine more about what is going on at PACW. I am a long term holder and will stay in given the massive drop in stock price to see where this is headed.

"To think I was ""amazed"" that this stock moved 5-10% in one day only 3 weeks ago. We get a vaccine and it jumps 25% in ONE DAY. Must be that the company fundamentals changed while we were all sleeping. Either way ......I'll take it."
"April 14th will be an important day for PACW. Q1 earnings announcement. The stock is so low the current dividend is 15%! So, will the dividend be maintained? Mgt has already cancelled stock repurchase programs. One of the big reason the stock is so depressed is the belief that small regional banks are going to suffer terribly with smb defaults on loan obligations to the bank. Could be true or the smb community might get bailed out by the Feds. Watch closely."

"So on March 4, 2020 the CEO tells Jenny Harrington that the dividend is ""safe"". CV-19 was known on this date. She restates that the dividend is safe on CNBC Halftime show. Then on May 2 they cut the dividend. So did the CEO lie or just changing his mind due to CV-19. Just saying......"
"If you do your research you will find that this deal for El Dorado for $467M was going to be financed with $60M in cash and the issuance of 8.1million shares of PACW. So looks like we need to put the $60M back in the cookie jar and ""UNDILUTE"" the shareholders."

June 4 stock price $55.62/share......December 11 stock price $35.03. That's a loss of 37%. Maybe the CEO needs to come out and say something.......at least that business (and earnings) are not 37% worse than they were in June.

On 3/4/2020...Jenny Harrington on the CNBC Halftime show recommended PACW saying the selloff in the regional bank is overdone. She noted that she spoke with the CEO's of Umpqua and PACW and both CEO's told her the dividend was safe (yielding 8% on 3/4). Well now its 4/22 in Coronaland and PACW has lost an ADDITIONAL 45% of its value since her recommendation. Best to do your own research."
"Nice bounce here in the past two days. Watch out for Thurs 4/9 trading for bank stocks. Weekly unemployment claims are released before market open.

I have not seen the press release announcing the share buyback.
You can see my justification for owning this stock in my post last month. You can't time the market but things are getting rich here so I took my profit (and the dividend) and sold it on this rally. My average buy price was $45. Bought at $46.94 and kept buying (in bigger quantities) as it went into the $43-44 range. Best of luck to all.

Looking into their current loan portfolio might cause some concern. Huge exposure to retail RE. Management has not done well in the recent years. They sold off a few assets which generated a lot of cash and focused on RE and construction lending. Not necessarily the exposure I would want as a lender.

"Just learned that Blackrock owns 16,147871 shares of PACW and had to file an SEC Form 13-c. That makes Blackrock a 13.7% owner of PACW. So if Blackrock wants to they could acquire the company, vote for a merger, or even take PACW private . Just an FYI. My brokerage firm does allow me to copy the link."
"Jenny Harrington was on CNBC today 3/4/2020 saying she thinks the sell off in Regional Banks is OVERDONE. She said that she spoke with the CEO's of Umpqua and PACW and that lower interest rates only affect net interest margins by 10% and the dividends are safe. She is buying both stocks. Jenny is a ""deep value"" investor. Price today is $30.82."
"It's always bothered me that PACW doesn't cover the dividend plans in their quarterly reporting. Why can't they just tell us? In approximate 7-10 days there will be a separate announcement about any dividend being paid, how much and when. Just tell us the day you report earnings."
They must have a lot of extra cash laying around at this pointâ€¦
"There are a lot of positives with this stock but the negatives I see in this stock are as follows:4.79% drop in net earnings year over year, but since shares decreased, the impact was only a penny.5% short ratio.30-89 days past due loans doubled from 17,085,000 to 30,587,000. We see the bulk of that in real estate and construction loans. Mind you this is only 0.16% of the portfolio, but could be representative of real estate loan trends in Cali.Trading at 2.15x tangible book value. Too much goodwill #$%$ already. Shareholders rightfully blocked the El Dorado deal.Compared to BAC's P/TBV of 1.35Compared to WFC's of 1.3924Dividend eats up 65% of earnings. Not terrible, but on the higher side of the split."

PACW announced dividend this morning - .25/share payable on Sept 9. Ex-dividend date is Friday August 28.
"The market today is projected to reward even expected big losers like PACW with gains. The market doesn't make any sense here. If PACW is projected to get slammed by big portfolio losses it should not go up even on up days in the market. Like the big banks, small regionals like PACW will most likely have huge increases in reserves for expected losses wiping our their quarterly bottom lines. Us longs are stuck in this situation unless we want to take big losses if we sell now. It will probably be more than a year before the banks start to settle down and get more back to normal. Some of the unanswered questions is how much the FEDS will help with loan losses at the banks. We will see."

what a great value at these levels. Have been nibbling on the way down. And on the way back up. Own a bunch in the 30's so I need to get my average cost of a share to around 25.
Still one of the best managed banks in the country. Should benefit from higher interest rates and a lower tax rate. Good credit quality together with outstanding interest margin and a low cost of funds result in great ROA and outstanding ROE. Buy for long run growth and enjoy a big fat dividend while you wait.

Are the earnings and quarterly report coming out today. I cannot find any information ?
Do not rule out the possibility of a very large wave of mergers and acquisitions in this turmoil. That could happen for many...many...many companies. In the regional banking world PACW would be more likely to be acquired than to buy someone else. The price is right if the acquirer buys with their shares.
"This is insane. Fine, cut EPS and the Divi by 50% and you are still trading at a P/E of 8 and <1x TBV, all with a 7.5% div yield on the lowered amount. Just stupid that this stock is getting beat up like this. This mass hysteria is going to ruin more good companies and good people's lives than it will make sick."
"If they paid out all earnings, the stock would yield 11.6%, it is 8.3xfree cash flow , and 8.7x earnings. They are earning over 20% on TBV. By any measure, the stock is very cheap. So what is wrong? They keep buying other banks and issuing stock for them. For some reason, they think bigger is better when buying your own stock back is miuch more accretive. The management and relationship with Castle Creek is detrimental. Castle Creek and the hack directors they put on the board are not adding value. They are just yes men. Having said all that, I am buying the stock."

"I just like to keep putting reminders out there of analyst and TV commentators on what they say about a stock and WHEN they say it. On Jim Cramers ""Lightning Round"" on December 12, a caller was asking about PACW. Jim said it was too ""nightmarish"". The close that day (12/12) was $35.45, today's close (3/18) PACW stock is $40.18. The S&P 500 is up 6.58% over this period. PACW is up 13.34% over the same period (12/12/18---3/18/19). Nothing against Jim, just saying that very few people go back and revisit the calls made. NO ONE comes out and says......I was wrong and here's why. How do the small investors who sold PACW on Jim's call feel? Do your own research......I do."
