"If you do your research you will find that this deal for El Dorado for $467M was going to be financed with $60M in cash and the issuance of 8.1million shares of PACW. So looks like we need to put the $60M back in the cookie jar and ""UNDILUTE"" the shareholders."
"85-90% shares held by institutions, 4 Billion valuation, $41-42 bv, PE below 11 payout ratio under 63% div 6.7% 600 mil in cash, and good earnings. and other banks now have strong stock currency to use. other than the majority of its facilities are located in CA... this is the perfect target to be taken over. and in the meantime.. you can sit back on the dividends and wait."
"If they paid out all earnings, the stock would yield 11.6%, it is 8.3xfree cash flow , and 8.7x earnings. They are earning over 20% on TBV. By any measure, the stock is very cheap. So what is wrong? They keep buying other banks and issuing stock for them. For some reason, they think bigger is better when buying your own stock back is miuch more accretive. The management and relationship with Castle Creek is detrimental. Castle Creek and the hack directors they put on the board are not adding value. They are just yes men. Having said all that, I am buying the stock."
"This is what I don't like about PACW. They reported quarterly earnings tonight (10/14/20). No announcement on when they will report. No management presentation or opportunity to ask questions, no comparison of actual vs expected for EPS or revenues. They always seem to have a ""report the earnings in the dark of the night, don't tell anyone it's coming, and then run and hide"". Where is the CEO's assessment of Q4, strategy, vision for the company??? Crazy way to run a company."
"Just reposting what I wrote on March 4, 2020, to show that even the fund managers (experts) often get it wrong. On 3/4/2020...Jenny Harrington on the CNBC Halftime show recommended PACW saying the selloff in the regional bank is overdone. She noted that she spoke with the CEO's of Umpqua and PACW and both CEO's told her the dividend was safe (yielding 8% on 3/4). Well now its 4/22 in Coronaland and PACW has lost an ADDITIONAL 45% of its value since her recommendation. Best to do your own research."
Today RBC Capital analyst raised the price target to $55.00!!
"Acker Tanya M, Director of PACWEST BANCORP bought 1600 shares on 2020-04-24. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=PACW"
"Hey Zacks, you downgraded PACW on 11/26/19 to a STRONG SELL @ $37.40. On 12/17 (only 3 weeks later) the stock is $38.95. That's a 4.14% move. Better than any of the financial indexes and the S&P. This is why we don't listen to you. Please post your MEA CULPA here. Thanks"
"So on March 4, 2020 the CEO tells Jenny Harrington that the dividend is ""safe"". CV-19 was known on this date. She restates that the dividend is safe on CNBC Halftime show. Then on May 2 they cut the dividend. So did the CEO lie or just changing his mind due to CV-19. Just saying......"
PacWest got buy at 57
PACW reached a 52 Week high at 48.33
"PACW released Q2 earnings this morning .28/share vs .32/share expected. Missed earnings, but not terrible.stock is already beaten down. Very little information comes out of PACW investor relations. No mention of Q3 guidance & no link to a Q2 conference call. Not good when a company doesn't keep investors informed as to what is going on."
The fastest way to increase the stock price1) Increase Revenue and Earnings2) Increase the dividend
PACW announced dividend this morning - .25/share payable on Sept 9. Ex-dividend date is Friday August 28.
Next week 1.2 trillion infrastructure bill approval will help their construction lending and greatly improve next few qtrs revenue.
Increased revenues at 327 million and beat earnings at 1.17. 650 million plus earnings for 2022. Undervalued should be 55 to 60
"Pacw is overbought. Made a small position , will add next week. Infrastructure structure bill approval will increase revenue and stock price to 60+"
"Looks like Friday 8/28 (Today) is the ex-div date. Here's the statement from PACW:PacWest Bancorp Announces Quarterly DividendCompany Release - 08/17/2020-- $0.25 Per Share Cash Dividend Payable on September 10, 2020 to Stockholders of Record on August 31, 2020 --LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PacWest Bancorp (Nasdaq: PACW) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share.

"Week away from blowout earnings, then upgrades and pass $50. Woohoo"
Will the company be able to maintain the dividend in light of significantly reduced net interest margin!!
