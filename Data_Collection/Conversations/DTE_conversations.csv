do they have many giveaway programs for Wayne County or Detroit residents? I fear this company will be on the edge after this virus situation finally kicks in. with the economy going down I fear Detroit and all lower end suburbs will have many famliles that simply cannot pay their electric bills. when that hits I fear DTE will tank to $75 or so. If this happens I fully expect their dividend to be cut; we'll see.

"This stock is a turd. Was selling at a premium. Zero free cash flow, trails other utilities in dividends. Has a new and worrisome management team. Too many promises and philanthropic missions. It will bottom out at 59. DTE ought to focus on core business. So many negative issues, law suit with Monroe over taxes and heavily leverage. If you want dividends, this is not it.. Weak"

"Next week ex-dividend 88+ cents, payable Oct 15. Hope to see news of an increase to near 95 cents for the following quarters. Projected 5 to 7 percent annual increased earnings through 2022. Barring total market collapse, long overdue."
Any chance of a split for this stock?

I'm just shocked that DTE isn't doing as well as some other stocks. this stock is a screaming buy under $100. I expect one more week quarter because of covid. big three to start up their factories on may 18th. which means all the suppliers have to start as well

"I am surprised they would want to split into a separate pipeline company. In 2018 every pipeline company went straight down. The Russian Pipeline to Germany is 98% complete and the US has done everything but bomb it to stop its completion. The US wants Germany to continue to buy more LNG at twice the price. Every pipeline company at least lost 50% of value and cut dividends, a great deal since 2017. I know very well, because I lost my shirt and pants. I had thought I would have the dividends to help my retirement. I bought DTE for the same reason, at 1/2 what the pipeline companies paid in dividends. DTE has pipelines in New York State. Williams invested nearly a billion in the Constitution Pipeline and after a ten year battle with NYS gave up. They are now the proud owner of a Right of Way that cannot be used for anything but a gas pipeline. Landowner contracts read that way. Pipelines going forward are a battle everywhere to build. What I wrote is a fact and all can be researched."
Got a notification from my well known brokerage firm that baby bond DTQ is being called. That would be at $25 call price. No date given. diligence before buying DTQ at this point of my brokerage is correct
Gotta love that DTE dividend. Can’t wait for the DT Midstream dividend

"EV/EBITDA 14.02 is OK, but it won't fix the end of December numbers. Long term it has nice curve on SMA 200 but the target was not met . ADX and ATR not worth mentioning"
if you look at price over five years still considerable profit to be taken and I think at this stage most of the utility stocks are taking their long term capital gains.

Probably an opportune time to buy at this low price today and take advantage of the .825/share for shareholders on record March 20th. Economy too strong for electrical use to go anywhere but up. Won't be long before A/C kicks up usage and share price as a bonus.
"How dumb are you people?These preferreds are going to be called in December - so you have 2 more dividends coming - about 80 cents/share and then they will be called for $25/share. Who is stupid enough to be paying over $26/share?They talk about the stupidity of those buying negative interest rate bonds, well here you have the equivalent. But again, how stupid are you? Anyone buying today and holding until December will have their shares taken away at $25/share.How stupid are you folks?"

"Hi,I am seeing posts regarding a stock dividend, and not a dividend on the stock. Would someone be kind enough to respond to me as to what will be happening in the future? I am a former Detroiter (Oak Park), and have held DTE for over 40 years. Thank you."
Stock price not doing to well. Any ideas why? Interest rates are not that bad compared to their history. That shouldn't be that much of an issue.. How are all these big $ electric cars going to run?

Ten years ago we dropped 50% on the share price, but never missed a dividend and recovered quite well. Still it would be nice to foresee such a recession and sidestep the decline.

The utility throws its political weight behind legislation that consolidates its power and hinders distributed generation. And with absurd rate hikes and notoriously unreliable service, DTE undermines local resilience"
dtv dumped most of their current programs for all older. I was watching 2016/2017 programs. now?? a bunch from 2008-2003etc. ALL REPEATS. THEY ARE GETTING LIKE NETFLIX.... ALL OLD STUFF. THEY KEEP RAISING PRICING. THEIR STOCK SHOULD START DROPPING. I NOW WATCH MOST ON INTERNET NOT DTV.

"Be careful, DTE is in a bad place right now. DTE can not make a mega watt of power for under $23.00, at present a mega watt has been selling between $14.00, and $21.00, with that being said DTE is loosing $2.00, to $9.00, per mega watt hour. These numbers equate to very large losses per day. Covid 19 has effected the daily demand for power, and the over abundance of natural gas has driven the mega watt price down to what it is now. DTE is very well diversified with their business holdings but public utilities are re-writing their business models as technology and green power evolves."
"I bought DTE a few years ago when it was in the 60s looking for a good dividend stock. I never expected such price appreciation, now wishing I had bought more."

"So DTE misses earnings by 6% with only a few weeks of the last month of Q1 really being affected by the pandemic and earnings are significantly lower than Q1 a year ago, but the stock rises nearly 4% on the day? I guess this is because the company maintained their previous guidance which is very concerning considering how Q2 will be based on a full three months of this crisis. IMO there is no way they come close to meeting Q2 or Q3 estimates this year."

due too all these business shutdowns the consumption of energy has to be markedly down; this will cause a significant drop in revenue for DTE and the other energy providers. I am not surprised if DTE goes down 5% today and by end of the month possibly be down 8% to 10%!

"we are stupidly, I fear, shutting down business all over the state of MI, particularly in the Detroit metro area. This will cause an enormous drop in energy consumption and will hurt DTE like nothing we have seen before.

"Next week is showtime. This C-Corp will have approx 97 million shares outstanding, so price is around ? for DTM. Anyone help with next weeks DTM-WI price?Spinoff of DT Midstream is set. Our estimates and TP are unchanged ahead of thedistribution date for DTM shares on July 1. DTE hosted an analyst/investor call on 6/9regarding the upcoming spin of DT Midstream (DTM). With the spin, DTE will be positionedas a mostly pure-play regulated Michigan based utility (90% of operating earnings from theregulated electric and gas utilities), while DTM will be positioned as a midstream C-Corp.For every 2 shares of DTE, 1 share of DTM will be distributed, and the total share count isexpected to be ~97M shares. Next steps include a virtual equity road show (June 9 – 28),with “when issued” trading expected to begin around June 17th and distribution date forDTM shares on July 1 for shareholders of record on June 18.

Now think for a moment, if you had no electricityfor today? What can and can not you do? You can not buy share, keep food hot or cold, make sky scrapers with ease, go to the moon. Get the idea. Now DTE is in the D. That's how you say Detroit and the surrounding area. This city is booming after the reorganization. I see large cranes downtown. Investors buying old solid buildings made in the days where architecture was classic, and renovating them. But most important a community and housing development in the downtown area of professional millennials are spurting growth in the D. The use of power in the area multiples. DTE is efficiently run and the power is clean. No wonder the stock price is near all time high."
