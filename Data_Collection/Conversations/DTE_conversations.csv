"Can not wait for this spin-off. Hope we see a yield around 8 or 9% like the others MLP's.DTE Energy has commenced the Form 10 registration process with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and remains on track to complete the spin-off of DT Midstream by mid-year 2021 [subject to final approval by the Companyâ€™s Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions]. Under the separation plan, DTE Energy shareholders will retain their shares of DTE Energy stock and receive a pro-rata dividend of shares of DT Midstream stock. The separation transaction is expected to be tax-free to DTE Energy and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes."
"Credit Suisse initiates coverage of DT Midstream with an Outperform rating and $52 price target, citing a high-quality, well covered with an estimated 6% yield in 2022."
"$DTE Energy DTE stock has fallen $8.19 cents since September 3rd. On today September 17th DTE stock has fallen $4.43 cents... what us the SEC even for, this is clearly HEDGE FUNDS MANIPULATING THE MARKET!"
"DTE Energy (DTE) - was added to Goldman Sachs' American Conviction List Tuesday by analysts who said the utility company ""offers an attractive growth position."" $135 target"
Downgraded. Big boys want in. Good sign I think. Hold or buy more for sure.
"smh another disappointing trading day for DTE. tomorrow I'm shorting DTE as soon as it hits 2:30, for the last few days as soon as it hits 3pm l, DTE starts falling"
"Dividend raise in the earnings report:The DTE Energy Board of Directors declared a $0.885 per share dividend on its common stock, payable Jan. 15, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business Dec. 20, 2021.

"I bought DTE a few years ago when it was in the 60s looking for a good dividend stock. I never expected such price appreciation, now wishing I had bought more."

"My brother, sister and I each have 450 shares that my grandfather bought in the 1950's. Dividends have been brought a lot of income to these families for 60 yrs. This is a buy and hold stock."

"Hi,I am seeing posts regarding a stock dividend, and not a dividend on the stock. Would someone be kind enough to respond to me as to what will be happening in the future? I am a former Detroiter (Oak Park), and have held DTE for over 40 years. Thank you."
news is out on spin off. Seeking Alpha has good article on distribution date/etc
9 out of the last 10 days down - loss of $ 8.
"$111.13 DTE is now down $10 from it's price less than 30 days ago. The stock is at it's price back in July, for no reason"
"I am surprised they would want to split into a separate pipeline company. In 2018 every pipeline company went straight down. The Russian Pipeline to Germany is 98% complete and the US has done everything but bomb it to stop its completion. The US wants Germany to continue to buy more LNG at twice the price. Every pipeline company at least lost 50% of value and cut dividends, a great deal since 2017. I know very well, because I lost my shirt and pants. I had thought I would have the dividends to help my retirement. I bought DTE for the same reason, at 1/2 what the pipeline companies paid in dividends. DTE has pipelines in New York State. Williams invested nearly a billion in the Constitution Pipeline and after a ten year battle with NYS gave up. They are now the proud owner of a Right of Way that cannot be used for anything but a gas pipeline. Landowner contracts read that way. Pipelines going forward are a battle everywhere to build. What I wrote is a fact and all can be researched."
