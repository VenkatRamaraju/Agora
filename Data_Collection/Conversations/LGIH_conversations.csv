"This is a 100bagger if you can hold ten years. Typical characteristics with high RoE , consistent growth in CAGR for revenue and share buyback. Patience is needed"
Look at he high today and current price. Buy now! This is a super opportunity.
"Do the math 300,000 avg VOL well try and cover 2.7 million shares. 9 days to cover more like 5 and double PPS. O YES BBBY RAD free others drug companies short squeeze had a few already this year, ACMR just very low float all about the sector HOME BUILDERS in FLO YES"
Love this stock.
"PE 10.8 is simply too low, average 14 sould be the norm. So, 30% up is expected. The price will be around 150 within 3 months. After the Covid is all gone, hopefully this fall, I bet his stock will be close to $200."
Fantastic earnings! If it wasn't for this market sell off today this would be in the 120's. Great buy here!
It is about time this stock got a PE upgrade. It is not the typical builder. It has very high margins and the leverage is not bad for a stock that is growing so fast. Earnings are being sandbagged and will approach $12.00 for 2020. Right now analysts have them at less than that for 2021. I expect they will grow the number of homes and earnings by 20% next year givng a total Eanrnings of $14.50. Even at todays weak 10X that would be $145.00 I think 13-14 is more like it since the growth rate is even higher and has been for some time. This would make LGIH a !95-$205 stock inside of 9 months.
"So Q4e EPS is $1.24 or 24% growth --- yet they just reported Q4 Closings up 62%, something tells me they are going to BEAT."
"Earnings this year will be a little over $7/share so we are trading at 11 times past earnings. Likely 2020 earnings will be about $8.00 maybe $8.20 but Use $.00 for simplicity. Homebuilders do not get a market multiple because of their cyclical nature, but the growth of this stock in sales and earnings consistently over the past 4-5 years should earn it a multiple of something like 13-14 which would indicate a price of $110.00 per share."
Pretty big % of the float is short. might make a good short squeeze trade.
Some new number crunching. If you assume 1% sales price increase over last quarter ( probably more) based on the number of closings sales will hit near the high estimate of about $680 million which is gong to make earnings in the range of $2.75-$2.90 per share. The consensus estimate is about $2.4 so we will beat by $.35- $.50 per share in my estimation.
Question??? OCT home closes anyone know #### and Y over Y GROWTH??? I know NOV and DEC also Jan but I can't find OCT if it was over 62% growth. I'm buying more before next report 27th before open. PLEASE HELP ME
"Short term pullback, this stock will be above 200 at the next surge which can be some time this Summer. With current price, the PE is only 10. should go to at least 13."
In December I said this and I think it is still true a $200 stock at some point this year. Although truth be told I did sell 25% today at $154.50. My basis for those shares was $35.54!
"looking to start a position, what's the opinion on the 10 yr yield climbing near 3%? Anyone think this will impact home sales? Also, why such a large short position?"
"We have been in the PE 9 area for more than three months, never this long before during an up trend market. It is about time for this stock to surge again, look at the current real estate market and the economic trend, there is no reason this stock can not reach $200 range in the next 3 or 4 months. Right now may be the last chance to get in below 160. It did go up to 180 once before, based on the past experience of this stock, it will not come down again the second time."
"As of October 3, Eric Lipar was still predicting 6400-7000 closings for the year. It's really perplexing to see the share price plummet like this. Seems out of touch with reality. Although there seems to be much about the market that is out of touch with reality these days."
"Down graded by JpMorgan to $115 caused the shr price down 4dollars yesterday. I just dont understand how they did this, they are suppose to be the professionals, can,t they see the earnings, revs, pe, roe,..etc about this company, are they all blinds? The only reason that I can come up is they or some big guys are playing games with this stock, They are trying to get the price way down first,and then buy the stock at the bottom price for huge profits. I may be wrong, but soon we will find out, the company will report 3Q earning earily next month, the numbers should be all good, lets wait and see."
"Earnings will come out in about 3 weeks. Here is a preview.Total revenue will be a bit north of $790 million. with EPS of $4.24/share. (maybe as high as $4.44). They might not raise guidance but it will be pretty transparent that they are sandbagging if they do not. They closed over 950 homes per month last Q and to beat the high end of guidance they only need to sell 820 per month. For the year it is clear to me that they will sell something north of 11,000 homes probably 11,300-11,500. Revenue will be almost 3.2 billion $150 million above the high estimate) and EPS will be $17.50 or more assuming those closings.I am assuming price increases will slow if they do not profits could be higher. If my projections are correct we are selling at 9X Earnings per share. With our growth pattern and ROI I would say we should normally get about a 13X multiple in this very cyclical business where multiples are usually much lower than the market as a whole. 13X gets us a price of $227. Pretty soon the market will start taking into consideration 2022 earning projections so we could conceivably see this touch 250-260 before the end of the current quarter."
Why
"Aug 21 2019 11:51 - BUY @79.54I was bullish on this one 7 months ago though I only did a short term trade. Looks good now with low interest rates and a concentration on supplying the lower end of the price range for housing. TOL is having some problems because they're in the luxury, high priced segement. Basically fundamentals are good here. BUY."
Q3 closings up 25% and September up 36% == momentum is building with easy comps ahead... new highs again soon
"PE below 9, ROE around 35% for a growing company is very rare. These numbers wont stay long like this. just wait and see."
Housing sector trading has been QUIET lately despite some very important and unexpected data.I think there's some opportunity ahead. Time to do the research.
Not a terrible quarter considering the Q4 sentiment ( December must've really saved the quarter). FY19 EPS guidance is quite strong and revs in line with expectations. Slowly taking market share.
LGIH best home builder because of that sweet GROWTH. 66% growth not bad and that is next qtr not MAY 8th all months 60% plus growth I know raw cost BUT higher prices on homes.
Look out for the earnings report..I think the impending blowout earnings report for the second quarter is getting priced in to the stock finally at over $100.00The range of estimates for revenue is 427-486 million I think they will achieve approximately 488 million. Here is how I get that. Take last years revenue and add 3.1% for the increase in number of homes sold. Then add 3% for the average increase in price over the past year when LGIH has increased prices fairly aggressively. I then backed off a few million ofr a higher percentage of Wholesaled homes this quarter compared to last year.As for earnings the range is $1.33 - $1.80 I think they will get very close to $2.00 most likely about $1.95 This is based on the level of sales and the guidance on gross margins as well as a discovery by LGIH during he pandemic that they can greatly reduce marketing costs and still make their sales. That is a permanent gain for the firm. Like I said I do not expect we will go sky rocketing from this report I think the market is at least as smart as I am and has taken this into account on the run to $102.73
"As I predicted, we are on the way to much higher price, with todays price at 122, it give us a PE 9.5 which is simply too low, LGIHis a small builder, no matter which way you look at it, a PE 13 is more reasonable, or even 14 in an uptrend market , plus the interest rate is so low, this stock has no way to go but up. I bet the price will be around 170-180 before the end of Summer. just wait and see..."
Big pop coming.
Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.
"Time for a little reflection on this years expectations. I cut and pasted from their press release but I cut out the disclaimers etc.disclaimer…..the Company offers the following guidance for 2020. The Company believes it will have between 120 and 130 active selling communities at the end of 2020 and close between 8,400 and 9,400 homes in 2020. In addition, the Company believes 2020 gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 22.5% and 24.5% and 2020 adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 24.5% and 26.5% with capitalized interest accounting for substantially all of the difference between gross margin and adjusted gross margin. The Company also believes that the average home sales price in 2020 will be between $235,000 and $245,000. This outlook assumes that general economic conditions, including interest rates and mortgage availability, in the remainder of 2020 are similar to those experienced so far in the first quarter of 2020 and that average home sales price, construction costs, availability of land, land development costs and overall absorption rates in the remainder of 2020 are consistent with the Company’s recent experience.Of course the pandemic hit and it obviously had short term and long term effects. Let’s see how they are doing or have done versus this initial guidance from the 2019 final year Press Release.120 – 130 active communities predicted and as of Dec 10th it looks like 115 so right on the mid range at least.8400-9400 homes predicted vs. 8800-9200 in the Dec 3 guidance which I think is sandbagged and will be a little over 9200 which would be near the high end of initial guidance.On gross margins they predicted 22.5 – 24.5 and adjusted of 24.5 – 26.5Through 9 months they were right on the high end of both gross margin predictions.They really missed the average selling price. They predicted 235-245K and actual through 9 months is $248K and will likely be about $250K by the end of the year.So my thoughts are even with the pandemic they have achieved or exceeded the high end of guidance (which I assume and hope they sandbag a little every year. )Looks pretty strong to me. Earnings will be impressive."
is this happening because inflation it pricing out new houses?
"this price is right above support and should be a good entry point for investors. November house closings increased and posted closings of 960 houses. The company raised its guidance to 8800-9200 closings from the previous estimate that was on the Q3 report of 8400-9000. Bullish IMO that guidance was raised, backlog and construction seems to be on pace to reach these numbers..currently from January-November, they are sitting at a total of 7709 closings throughout 2020...to reach 8800 lower end of guidance, they will need to close 1091 houses. i see this happening due to the fact they raised their guidance for the full year 2020 numbers."
Street is way off on this stock. High prices push people to LGI. Higher rates push people to LGI
LGI Homes is down 5.00% to 151.41
"Record December sales, this stock is way undervalued"
Going to $85-$90 before year end. IMO Strong growth. EPS will eb at the very top end of the range I think. They will be at a run rate of over $2.00 per qtr (excluding Q1 which is more like $1.50 totaling about $8.00-$8.50 per share next year. That means we are trading currently at 6.6X next years EPS. I think 10X-12X is more called for with the level of growth we have here.
September housing closures down roughly 12% y/y and 3rd quarter closure expected to be down 10% y/y. Hidden in the headline and discussed in many conferences calls is the fact that Q3 2017 was a period of extremely high demand for new homes and should be considered as an outlier with respect to the overall run-rate. sales in the first three months of 2018 have grown 19% y/y.
Blowout earnings I am glad they announce earnings yesterdayThe pop today could be huge
"Amazing Q4 results, it's a solid 10% of my portfolio and I soon hope that the price will increase, undervalued AF"
