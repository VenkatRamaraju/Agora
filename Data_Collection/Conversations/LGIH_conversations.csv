is this happening because inflation it pricing out new houses?
Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.
Wow over 1600 in December. I said they would be strong but that is way more than I expected. Now at $255K/home Q4 revenue will be $870 million. In Q3 on $534M in revenue they made $3.55 and they expect margins to be at or higher than last quarter so are we looking at at $5.00 or $5.50 pewr share this quarter?

LGIH is up 7.57% to 53.84
"This share price is an absolute gift...feels like Christmas! Load up, people!"
LOW great buy today
"As a former employee, this stock was bound to tumble. Even told my boss, as they were hyping up all of the employees to participate in the Stock Purchasing Plan that they offered, that even though the stock hit $75/share our stock was a $50/share value stock. The day after I quit the stock began it’s correction. This will easily be a $30 stock by the end of the month. Sorry Eric, Mike, Stacy, and Jason... I called it! Eric, Mike, and Stacy have lost MILLIONS together!"
"LGIH went up too fast and too much. Small correction is good for the stock, I still think this stock will go up to the 80's late this year, but it may go down to the 50's first before that."

Question is being on the ALL TIME HIGH LIST mean anything????? Don't even worry about shorts they are covering on that dip few months ago. I am HAPPY don't worry JJ be HAPPY tic toc Jimmy Johnson
"Earning will be out on May 3, the share price may reach 175.-180."
"Short term pullback, this stock will be above 200 at the next surge which can be some time this Summer. With current price, the PE is only 10. should go to at least 13."
The ETF exposure is killing this stock.... It is a screaming buy right now.
"Now we are moving up, about time, PE 12 is simply too low, 15 to 16 will be the norm which means the stock price should be in the 90s. I have been right on this stock for 3 years. Their business has been the same for the last 3 years and should continue the same way for 2018 and 2019. So, 90s by the end of this year is my guess and should top 100 next year."
somebody tell me why this stock is dropping ?
Sales declined yr/yr. This even with higher community count. May be telling as to at least short term outlook. Not good.
This week should have #### for JUNE
Big time beat and raise. Hopefully this stock takes off today
52-week high list who's on it???? AMD nope NVDA soon both
LGI Homes is down 5.00% to 151.41
LGI Homes is down 5.07% to 160.19
Q1 earnings estimate is only 83c vs 1.11 last year - and they just reported flat home sales...lumber prices lower too ? looks like a potential for an Q1 earnings beat.
LGIH reached a new 52 Week Low at $44.04
It is about time this stock got a PE upgrade. It is not the typical builder. It has very high margins and the leverage is not bad for a stock that is growing so fast. Earnings are being sandbagged and will approach $12.00 for 2020. Right now analysts have them at less than that for 2021. I expect they will grow the number of homes and earnings by 20% next year givng a total Eanrnings of $14.50. Even at todays weak 10X that would be $145.00 I think 13-14 is more like it since the growth rate is even higher and has been for some time. This would make LGIH a !95-$205 stock inside of 9 months.
Look at he high today and current price. Buy now! This is a super opportunity.
New 52 week high ! love it.... despite that recent downgrade
The results and future prospects for at least a yr out are solid and undeniably way above average. Institutional moves are just buying ops with 0 doubt
Thank You LORD ask and you shall receive AMEN my friend brothers and sister how about a joke ??? I.ll make it good one
LGIH is a top 10 member of Fortune's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.
"I just up my holding of this stock by 30%. Can not believe we came down this much the last 2 days. with earning in the 6-7 dollars range this year, no matter which way you look at it, it should be in the 90-100 dollars range. I have watched this stock for 3 years, and guessed right on almost every its stock price move, so I bet I will be right again this time. I visited several of their subdivisions, they were so busy to sell houses, every salesmen are busy talking to people, not like some other builders, the sales person has nothing to do most of the time."
LGIH is down -5.27% to 63.01
Street is way off on this stock. High prices push people to LGI. Higher rates push people to LGI
LGIH reached a new 52 Week Low at $46.76
"As of October 3, Eric Lipar was still predicting 6400-7000 closings for the year. It's really perplexing to see the share price plummet like this. Seems out of touch with reality. Although there seems to be much about the market that is out of touch with reality these days."
Love this stock.
"It seems the market is worried about thier low ball guidance. This is what is done every year. Check the last two years. Exact same thing great performance, and guidance that is growing but not quite as fast as the market expects. Then they proceed to blow it out of the water immediately. Look at where there guidance was a year ago and what they achied (with Covid)."
I'm waiting for MAY home closes unless LGIH trades back under 60 again. GB CIEN money after report some going into LGIH and WSM adding to MU and AMAT also. YES I have a lot riding on CIEN Thrus report before open.
Not many public companies have LGIH's growth rates.
"stock down big had nothing to do with company performance obviously. liquidity issues of stock, investors on strike, and fear of coronavirus recession. If a vaccine is successful, this would all reverse."
"So Q4e EPS is $1.24 or 24% growth --- yet they just reported Q4 Closings up 62%, something tells me they are going to BEAT."
"Very light VOL why NO ONE is SELLING is the reason WHY. New 52-week high and all time high list coming soon. I THINK, I thought I was wrong one time in my life BUT I was just mistaken. I Traded my wife for a boat best deal I've ever made in my life."
"looking to start a position, what's the opinion on the 10 yr yield climbing near 3%? Anyone think this will impact home sales? Also, why such a large short position?"
2 cents away from new 52-week high O YES closer and closer to my PT 120 squeeze 160
LGIH is up 5.93% to 69.65
No dividend here ???
Rick that's not why the stock tanked today. It's a highly seasonal business. revenues and earnings are always lower in the first qtr.
LGIH is down -5.24% to 59.51
"Still cheap, earning will reach 6.20 for 2018, apply a PE 16, the stock price should reach 100 by the end of this year if not early. For long term, 130by end of 2019, 175 by end of 2020."
LGIH made 52-week high list NOT BAD
Is this one a really cheap value stock? Or is there something that I missed?
"434 closings Jan 2020, up from 269 in Jan 2019. increase of 61.3%. 105 active selling communities Jan 2020 vs 83 active selling communities Jan 2019."
Good opportunity to buy LGIH? LGIH =value + growth
Q3 closings up 25% and September up 36% == momentum is building with easy comps ahead... new highs again soon
"Give us the JUNE home closes QUICK, FRIDAY RIGHT???"
Going to $85-$90 before year end. IMO Strong growth. EPS will eb at the very top end of the range I think. They will be at a run rate of over $2.00 per qtr (excluding Q1 which is more like $1.50 totaling about $8.00-$8.50 per share next year. That means we are trading currently at 6.6X next years EPS. I think 10X-12X is more called for with the level of growth we have here.
"EPS 12.89 at PE 14 should give us $180share price, even PE 13, we should see $170. Time to get in now. I expect 60% price increase before July."
DEC home closes I hope is 50% or more. I guess 48% will be OK. Since est are 30% growth and already have 48% and 52%
Fantastic earnings! If it wasn't for this market sell off today this would be in the 120's. Great buy here!
"With PE 9.6, PP is only $60. Does not make sense, Summer is coming. My guess is $100 within 3 months with PE at around 14."
Time to buy some trading at about 8X next years earnings.
CNBC stock draft I'll pick LGIH TY THINK I'll win %%%% better then even AAPL
Downgraded and trading HIGHER FUNNY
LGIH is down -6.72% to 61.60
Home builder stocks fell today in reaction to the June new home sales data which showed another decline from the prior month. LGIH has reports there home closing each month and in contrast to the industry numbers they continued to show month to month gains. If margins can remain strong LGIH should once again outshine its competition.
Spring loaded
feb 6th??? wait
"Aug 21 2019 11:51 - BUY @79.54I was bullish on this one 7 months ago though I only did a short term trade. Looks good now with low interest rates and a concentration on supplying the lower end of the price range for housing. TOL is having some problems because they're in the luxury, high priced segement. Basically fundamentals are good here. BUY."
Huge buying opportunity!!!
"This is a good company, but I do see a problem here. If you just look a the balance sheet, the amount of debt they have just keeps going up considerable as they build more and more inventory of housing. That's great if the housing boom continues, but it's not if we have a crash in housing like in 2007."
"I hope we don't get that blow out qtr and trades down. BUT it would be time to LOAD UP the TRUCK if it does. I don't think it ran up to much before earning. All about the outlook they low balled outlook last qtr and WS knows it. UNDER PROMISE and over deliver, OK with me."
"Earnings will come out in about 3 weeks. Here is a preview.Total revenue will be a bit north of $790 million. with EPS of $4.24/share. (maybe as high as $4.44). They might not raise guidance but it will be pretty transparent that they are sandbagging if they do not. They closed over 950 homes per month last Q and to beat the high end of guidance they only need to sell 820 per month. For the year it is clear to me that they will sell something north of 11,000 homes probably 11,300-11,500. Revenue will be almost 3.2 billion $150 million above the high estimate) and EPS will be $17.50 or more assuming those closings.I am assuming price increases will slow if they do not profits could be higher. If my projections are correct we are selling at 9X Earnings per share. With our growth pattern and ROI I would say we should normally get about a 13X multiple in this very cyclical business where multiples are usually much lower than the market as a whole. 13X gets us a price of $227. Pretty soon the market will start taking into consideration 2022 earning projections so we could conceivably see this touch 250-260 before the end of the current quarter."
"So 20% growth is 7,200 homes sold and 60% is WOW???? LOL"
I did some calculating and the analysts covering this stock are expecting better performance than the company has guided. LGIH is saying 6900 - 7800 homes at an average price of 235-245K. So far through June they are averaging a 237K price and with the higher priced initiative I am assuming $240K for the year and likely that will be close. For the home sold though the low estimate assumes 7400 (whereas the middle of guidance was only 7350. Average analysts said 7500 and the highest is at approximately 7640.
CC should take LGIH to 85 raised PT and upgrades should get about 3
"Amazing Q4 results, it's a solid 10% of my portfolio and I soon hope that the price will increase, undervalued AF"
The Moody's upgrade should be good news. Even though debt to capitalization keeps going down they have about $600M in debt and the better rating means lower interest costs and higher PE. For free basically. EPS in 2021 could be insane. The high profits are such they can use the cash generated to fund 2021 growth. No dividends from this stock but the growth could be great if this ever gets a PE reset in line with where markets are for other segments.
TOL and all other home builders are HIGHER what is wrong with LGIH. They beat top and bottom line and we knew about margin BUT they will get better home prices going higher already have started. Get more then asking price 30% of the time.
"forward pe of 7 ? really? with gdp 4% this quarter and no significant inflation. This is priced as if it is about to fall off a cliff. Irrational market. Yes, I've got plenty of Google too but her PE is 50 with less growth than this entry range housing company. I have tried to show this to some of my other investing buddies but they don't get it at all. Maybe Americans are just not good at math."
Not a terrible quarter considering the Q4 sentiment ( December must've really saved the quarter). FY19 EPS guidance is quite strong and revs in line with expectations. Slowly taking market share.
"Chart readers am I right or wrong NFLX has a golden cross and GS 425 PT. Then LGIH is going to have golden cross soon I PRIMSE. But if you have extra money wait on ATVI DVN OXY RIO OR BUY PPC and TSN today maybe even steel X,AKS, USA steel companies BS??? China bought them I THINK or BK lets build some steel plants with clean iron from CLF ??? I WISH but CMTL great buy on that dip also crus"
Sell the news it seems.
"This looks like it's going down. I'm short right now, I know the market is bullish but this seems to be weak all the same. Might be related to interest rates who knows. We shall see."
Enough is enough. 70 by year end 2019

Question??? OCT home closes anyone know #### and Y over Y GROWTH??? I know NOV and DEC also Jan but I can't find OCT if it was over 62% growth. I'm buying more before next report 27th before open. PLEASE HELP ME
I bought 9 LGI Homes in north dallas last year after August and 2 in 2018. This builder builds house quick and a little cheap. But sold fast since it allows investors. I am bullish on this stock to go beyond $100 a share in one year.
"From Investors Business DailyOn Wednesday, LGI Homes (LGIH) got an upgrade for its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating from 88 to 97.The new rating shows the stock is outpacing 97% of all stocks when it comes to the most important stock-picking criteria.LGI Homes is currently forming a cup without handle, with an 89.10 entry. Look for the stock to break out in volume at least 40% higher than normal."
LGIH is down -4.98% to 74.84
"I think that this quarters sales growth is about 13% above on year ago --with 1052 sales vs 934 -- please correct me if I am wrong. That is not a good number, but what do I know? Back when they were growing 25% plus each quarter the stock was stuck at a very low price but quite volatile. Now it seems be steadily increasing in spite worsening numbers. I am not short the company and am a long term positive but my wrong thinking made me imagine I might buy in at a much lower price with these numbers. Still, unless their margins increased a lot, or they somehow raise forward earnings, this quarter's report is going to be a miss (sales growth slowing) and I think I can buy shares below 30 -- we'll see. Also pretty certain rates will rise with next Fed meeting and yet that might be good for a company who sells lower priced homes. Just my thoughts as I am trying to use some logic to make money in this company. If it is a sector issue -- I would imagine the whole Home-builder stocks will start sinking as rates have to begin going up in the next few years."
"I need new hearing aids. I could swear I heard Eric say earnings (conservatively) of $6-7.00 for 2018, with all indicators positive. I must have heard him wrong. Maybe he said the company would lose $6-7.00??"
"Record December sales, this stock is way undervalued"
I want back in also but dad sold so not in LGIH anymore. Time to buy on dips 7-10%
New entrant homebuyer w 30+ growth. Take it all day. They can run for the next ten years.
"Do the math 300,000 avg VOL well try and cover 2.7 million shares. 9 days to cover more like 5 and double PPS. O YES BBBY RAD free others drug companies short squeeze had a few already this year, ACMR just very low float all about the sector HOME BUILDERS in FLO YES"
Pretty big % of the float is short. might make a good short squeeze trade.
"LGIH seems like a no-brainer to me at these prices. They are in a demographic sweet spot (first time buyers looking for low cost entry), and have performed amazingly well over time. Three new Communities announced in the last week! I guess some people may be spooked by the possibility of higher interest rates, but they should affect LGIH the least considering that it offers lower bracket prices. The apparently large short position, according to my understanding, is largely the result of hedging by holders of convertible debt and, to that extent at least, does not represent a bet against the company's future. The convertibles are close to conversion parity, and in any case mature in two or three years, so they won't be a factor too much longer."
On the way to $150.00 we will learn about March closings and all the analysts will recalibrate their estimates aznd then LGIH will announce much higher EPS for Q1 and then we will go on past $150. Just saying. BTW look at what I said here previously about LGIH
What the heck is happening???
52-week high list again soon TODAY???
"I’ve got a feeling this stock is on the way to $200 this year. Great company, growing nice and steady and able to get new buyers into houses with financial assistance."
"Lumber prices have been halved this year, despite tariffs and a supply chain labor shortage. Yes, rising rates don't help entice the many would-be buyers, but as long as the Fed continues to ratchet up the Hawkish rhetoric, demand will remain strong as buyers realize it'll only get more expensive the longer they wait ( buy now before rising interest rates makes it even more expensive)."
Home construction at an eleven year high. One would think LGIH might react at little more on the upside. LGIH probably is benefiting more than other builders because of the market it serves.
WELL know 60% couldn't last for ever still good company looking at rev est and eps. Waiting on JUNE home closes now
"234% (LGIH) try options O YES and I got some PHM not working yet, Jan calls 45 strike"
Why
52-week high list SPCE unreal the move higher. I got EXAS for another growth play
Future looks good
"Opportunity to get in now, it will back to 80 soon. Look at the earnings they just put out. nothing wrong. may be too good..."
Is it a good investment at these levels of $50g
Melt up to 100
My screener brought LGIH to my attention. Surprised it doesn't pay a divy. Wondering how lumber prices will impact earnings. I did take a small position @ $160. Keeping some powder incase I mistimed it.
"At $53 , PE 10, way too low... We'll see after August number out in a few days."
I love it when the market get's it wrong.
LGIH reached a new 52 Week Low at $40.03
"Where's last months sales figures? Don't they usually release this by now? Given today's decline, maybe tomorrow?"
Question - what are the negatives with this company? Why such high short position and such low PE for a company growing better than 20%/year? If someone out there could please educate me. Growing too fast? Worry about rising interest rates? Too high debt? thanks in advance.
Blowout earnings I am glad they announce earnings yesterdayThe pop today could be huge
OK they raised outlook but LGIH popped 10bucks. After they LGIH pop another 10 and keeps going to 120.
"Big drop, but low volume. Big overreaction imho."
RECORD DECEMBER NOT BAD and the outlook very sweet
Going over 110 soon sales q4 are going to be $615 million which is way above estimates
Big stock sell off coming in August.
"Time to get in now, won‘t be this low for long, never stayed at PE 10 for this long, next surge will be 200, the only fear is interest rate, but that won‘t affect us until mid 2022. By that time we will be way above 200."
LGIH reached a new All Time High at 80.58
looks like the conversation is between you and me Craig.
LGIH is up 6.31% to 80.58
Run Forrest Run
I say Zillow is going for LGIH and BUILD more homes in FL PLEASE. I know a couple live across the street they have 14 houses one for sale and 12 they rent out military in this part of FL. GREAT BUSINESS renting to military families around tis part of FL. They move about every 2 to 4 yrs its unreal the money to be made renting houses out. O and if you can take care of home repairs yourself GOD LORD make millions every year.
"This is a 100bagger if you can hold ten years. Typical characteristics with high RoE , consistent growth in CAGR for revenue and share buyback. Patience is needed"
Well over all new homes didn't meet est BUT every month LGIH has had 52% growth. So who is the best home builder??? O YES LGIH
LGIH reached a new 52 Week Low at $45.85
FIRST to cover and go long wins I know or wait and see cover at 120.
In December I said this and I think it is still true a $200 stock at some point this year. Although truth be told I did sell 25% today at $154.50. My basis for those shares was $35.54!
"Finally seeing LGIH stock buyback, this can increase the share price."
"can somebody tell me what am i missing here or is the mr. market blind?very low P/Egood peg ratiogreat earningsover all great fundamentals ,and its tanking"
Some new number crunching. If you assume 1% sales price increase over last quarter ( probably more) based on the number of closings sales will hit near the high estimate of about $680 million which is gong to make earnings in the range of $2.75-$2.90 per share. The consensus estimate is about $2.4 so we will beat by $.35- $.50 per share in my estimation.
"any ideas why down? if i take the midpoint of avg selling price and midpoint of # of homes on forward guidance, i get a revenue beat. buying opportunity at eod?"
mann that $55-56 totally unjustified dip was such a great entry point. Long LGIH
RAW cost higher or profit margins THEN again home prices have ROSE also and LGIH is selling all they can build. The whole sector is great for another two yrs maybe 3 yrs. BLDR said LUMBER prices are higher GO LPX. and I like USG still me and Warren Buffet
6 of the last 7 days have hit NEW 52-week high. ALL TIME HIGH LIST O YES Z is also good LL wood floors for homes are coming back or replaced or FND
Big buys after hours. Smart money
"I'll explain further when I have time. Been following this company for awhile now. You're probably looking at shares trading in the $42.25-$50.75 range, and most likely holding around $46.50 until next quarter. Basically, 5% , 16.25%, or 26.87% gains from a $40 share price. This of course all depends on how the markets in general trade, I.e. Elections, bond markets, trade war, etc and overall optimism. I think they are doing the right things, and they are transparent. But I do think this Management is a little too sure of themselves, and the street has been giving them a tune-up."
$85.18 Time to buy Anyone jumping in with me?
"We have been in the PE 9 area for more than three months, never this long before during an up trend market. It is about time for this stock to surge again, look at the current real estate market and the economic trend, there is no reason this stock can not reach $200 range in the next 3 or 4 months. Right now may be the last chance to get in below 160. It did go up to 180 once before, based on the past experience of this stock, it will not come down again the second time."
the forward guidance is low-balled by a lot.
It feels so good when the market realizes you were right about a stock
not sure anyone uses yahoo board anymore -- but I have had interesting info from other investors in the past -- so I'll give it a try. Last 2 months sales reports seem tepid -- down in July and up 19% in August from one year ago figures. To continue at 20% growth they needed to sell ??? 530 homes in Sept. -- seems doubtful. I am guessing the number is leaked out and maybe that explains some selling today. A short term disappointment might cause the stock to drop back into the high 20's. Long term still see 15% growth and with a PE of 15 and earnings of 4 $ a fair price would be 60$. Probably not going to happen -- probably stuck with pe of 10 as growth seems to be slowing ( maybe communities outside Texas don't sell as well). So a fair price would be $40 one year from now. I think there will be opportunity to buy in at a lower price in the next month or two as slower growth becomes more evident. complicating factor are the large funds who want to buy shares in the company which seem to be multiplying -- they cause gyrations in both directions and make this more common sense approach quite difficult at times. Somebody tell me what I am missing.
LOOK at VOL NO SELLERS its a good thing. I THINK or LGIH 52-week high list maybe???
LGIH is down -6.47% to 65.39
"Earnings this year will be a little over $7/share so we are trading at 11 times past earnings. Likely 2020 earnings will be about $8.00 maybe $8.20 but Use $.00 for simplicity. Homebuilders do not get a market multiple because of their cyclical nature, but the growth of this stock in sales and earnings consistently over the past 4-5 years should earn it a multiple of something like 13-14 which would indicate a price of $110.00 per share."
"We hit 150 today, I was a little too conservative about this stock a few weeks ago. looks like we will hit 170-180 before the Summer starts. With the earning estimates, next year will be something like $2, 3, 3, 6. These will give us aTotal of $14 for the whole year. Apply a PE of 14, the share price should be somewhere around $200 by the end of next February. I believe we will hit $2 on the next earning report which is scheduled around May 7, 2021."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lgi-homes-reports-november-2020-000200663.htmlamazing numbers and growth but still down almost 3% today??? 10% in past month?? Must be some analysis out there that housing sales are going to fall next year -- I think once COVID is controlled with a vaccine house sales are going to go up.( there are parts of the country like Boston and NYC that have just about shut down in the past year for travel/ top job growth. Just amazing to me that a company that grows like this has a pe of 10 and drops on a day when they announce record sales and up projections. This is a crazy business and I've been spooked out this stock in the past by massive falls I could not understand. also, how would one compare this company to MHO? Smaller company but seems to be growing also."
"Time for a little reflection on this years expectations. I cut and pasted from their press release but I cut out the disclaimers etc.disclaimer…..the Company offers the following guidance for 2020. The Company believes it will have between 120 and 130 active selling communities at the end of 2020 and close between 8,400 and 9,400 homes in 2020. In addition, the Company believes 2020 gross margin as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 22.5% and 24.5% and 2020 adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) as a percentage of home sales revenues will be in the range of 24.5% and 26.5% with capitalized interest accounting for substantially all of the difference between gross margin and adjusted gross margin. The Company also believes that the average home sales price in 2020 will be between $235,000 and $245,000. This outlook assumes that general economic conditions, including interest rates and mortgage availability, in the remainder of 2020 are similar to those experienced so far in the first quarter of 2020 and that average home sales price, construction costs, availability of land, land development costs and overall absorption rates in the remainder of 2020 are consistent with the Company’s recent experience.Of course the pandemic hit and it obviously had short term and long term effects. Let’s see how they are doing or have done versus this initial guidance from the 2019 final year Press Release.120 – 130 active communities predicted and as of Dec 10th it looks like 115 so right on the mid range at least.8400-9400 homes predicted vs. 8800-9200 in the Dec 3 guidance which I think is sandbagged and will be a little over 9200 which would be near the high end of initial guidance.On gross margins they predicted 22.5 – 24.5 and adjusted of 24.5 – 26.5Through 9 months they were right on the high end of both gross margin predictions.They really missed the average selling price. They predicted 235-245K and actual through 9 months is $248K and will likely be about $250K by the end of the year.So my thoughts are even with the pandemic they have achieved or exceeded the high end of guidance (which I assume and hope they sandbag a little every year. )Looks pretty strong to me. Earnings will be impressive."
Just bought some shares today after it got killed because two firms decreased their holdings of it. I’ve been waiting for a good time to enter. Great time to buy
Housing sector trading has been QUIET lately despite some very important and unexpected data.I think there's some opportunity ahead. Time to do the research.
The high end of estimates assumes about 9030 closing in total. I think we will be a couple hundred above that and get earnings up to close to $12 for the year which will m ake analysts realize that next year is likely to be more like $14 EPS/share.
RECORD QTR==== MONEY steal today wanted to trade HON for more LGIH. Great management
December closings could be released tonight or before the open tomorrow if my math is correct on their normal methods.
Link to CC please
"this price is right above support and should be a good entry point for investors. November house closings increased and posted closings of 960 houses. The company raised its guidance to 8800-9200 closings from the previous estimate that was on the Q3 report of 8400-9000. Bullish IMO that guidance was raised, backlog and construction seems to be on pace to reach these numbers..currently from January-November, they are sitting at a total of 7709 closings throughout 2020...to reach 8800 lower end of guidance, they will need to close 1091 houses. i see this happening due to the fact they raised their guidance for the full year 2020 numbers."
Big pop coming.
PT: 101 . Selloff is Commodity driven and wayyyy overcooked. Lumber is actually off today... Divergence. Great quarter! I'm a buyer.
To many POT stocks need some well few to merge together PLEASE APHA
Capitulation?
"Interest rates going up KEEP HOPE ALIVE SHORTS. Then home prices also going HIGHER==== REV for LGI HOMES O WS over looked this IPO. We have a winner so STOP whinning its all good, buy on the dip avg up or avg down. SHORTS cover and GO LONG EX SAFM"
"best financial stats I've ever seen on a company, literally the best ran company in the entire market. Tanks almost 10% in 2 days of me buying it..."
"Just as I predicted, we are now approaching $40. I am not sure if this stock will continue go up or not after they report next month's closing number. The stock price went up so fast the last few weeks. I feel better if it pauses for a while. But at end, I believe they will be in the range of $60-&70 in about a year."
"The headlines tell us that home sales are down for the last several months. Strangely, home builder stocks, including LGIH go down with that news. Nobody, apparently, reads the next few sentences which tell us that one of the reasons sales are down is that there are not many houses available to buy. Seems to me that the home builders should have a long green road ahead --- once they get out of the rut."
Look out for the earnings report..I think the impending blowout earnings report for the second quarter is getting priced in to the stock finally at over $100.00The range of estimates for revenue is 427-486 million I think they will achieve approximately 488 million. Here is how I get that. Take last years revenue and add 3.1% for the increase in number of homes sold. Then add 3% for the average increase in price over the past year when LGIH has increased prices fairly aggressively. I then backed off a few million ofr a higher percentage of Wholesaled homes this quarter compared to last year.As for earnings the range is $1.33 - $1.80 I think they will get very close to $2.00 most likely about $1.95 This is based on the level of sales and the guidance on gross margins as well as a discovery by LGIH during he pandemic that they can greatly reduce marketing costs and still make their sales. That is a permanent gain for the firm. Like I said I do not expect we will go sky rocketing from this report I think the market is at least as smart as I am and has taken this into account on the run to $102.73
That hurt
LGIH is down -4.92% to 67.70
Doubled down. Be 80 before year end
"Signs of life today. Hopefully, it will turn into a trend."
"As I predicted, we are on the way to much higher price, with todays price at 122, it give us a PE 9.5 which is simply too low, LGIHis a small builder, no matter which way you look at it, a PE 13 is more reasonable, or even 14 in an uptrend market , plus the interest rate is so low, this stock has no way to go but up. I bet the price will be around 170-180 before the end of Summer. just wait and see..."
"I bet the last 2 days sell-off was a computer selling set by someone at the trigger point of $80 which was reached right after the company announced earning. Now the selling side is a little slow, I am thinking this sell-off should end soon, and price will go up sometime today or tomorrow, we'll see."
"Bought heavy at $99. No brained here. Low rates, stimulus = closing costs for many + low cost home builder. Match made in heaven."
May home closes ??? I thought today was the day good wait until I have some extra money to load up. Been here since 28 BUT O LORD the money I could of made 20 dollar swing after hitting 52-week high. CRAZY
1500 sales will give them $840 million in revenue. High estimate is $811 . High estimate is $3.65 actual will be over $4.00! Todays numbers indicate how hot the market is on the low side which is where LGIH lives in 100%!
LGIH buy more at 80 doesn't make sense does it. I have my reasons
WHY NO upgrades or raised PT o well CMTL all is well GO OSTK and LL is a great buy today.
Why the big drops yesterday and today?
"Take shorts 13 days to cover LGIH. NVAX was a short squeeze, RAD, and O TSLA and BBBY is going to have one with CLF. I THINK GB"
THEY raised est up37% was 35% but stock went higher and they still will beat wait for jan #### for next qtr the feb qtr === GROWTH. I THINK GB
112 is still support level HOME BUILDERS may go a sale today LEN DHI and TOL they do make a great HOME well build one YOU know what I mean JJ
Buy now. It’s easily going to above 80. 13 multiple (lowest in the space w higher ROE) on the low end of the range.
They are expanding. They want to be a leader in this sector. Hope they dont build up too much debt.Late economy cycle not favorable for consumer discretionary. Great company though. Long term value play
Good its coming back CCS was also sweet home builder play. AUDC just hit 52-week high 5 yr high THEY raised outlook 27th on the CC. WHO does that in this environment. SWKS Listen to that CC 20 mins shortest CC I've ever listen to and SWKS just keeps getting better. JIM will have two dogs soon one named NVDA the other SWKS.
September housing closures down roughly 12% y/y and 3rd quarter closure expected to be down 10% y/y. Hidden in the headline and discussed in many conferences calls is the fact that Q3 2017 was a period of extremely high demand for new homes and should be considered as an outlier with respect to the overall run-rate. sales in the first three months of 2018 have grown 19% y/y.
It is amazing that company that is greowing earnings as fast as LGIH that has a trailing EPS of $17.50 and will be higher than that at year end is selling for 9 times trailing earnings and at bout 6-7 times forward earnings.What a bargain. Instead of share buybacks maybe a dividend. Also less sandbagging in the forecast would be appreciated. They guided forward at the high end more than 100 houses a month less than the current run rate.
AUG home closes any guess ???? I think about 20% higher
Earnings will be $5.00 or slightly more this$ putting them over $12.50 for the year. Current price would make it just 8X earnings. I think we will move very quickly once the market realizes that the guidance for next year would mean about $14 EPS in 2021. 12X that would put us well north of $150 which is where this will go once the market learns the math.
"With January's closings 61% up year over year, one would think the stock should show some green (:-)."
New 52-week high list great list to be on JJ.
"PE 10.8 is simply too low, average 14 sould be the norm. So, 30% up is expected. The price will be around 150 within 3 months. After the Covid is all gone, hopefully this fall, I bet his stock will be close to $200."
"The computer dumping is over, we are on the way to 130. pe is only 10 now, should be around 14."
GAME OVER FOR HOUSING
pop all the way down
We going up today???Is this the bounce??
"This is going by down due to rate concerns. They barely use their laborBased line, long term rates are struggling to move and wood materials are not in tariff land. Buy em up"
Closed GREEN but need to pass 112 to become stable before new 52 week high 159 worth 160 easy
35% of the float is short... cannot wait for the conference call. Millennials are just entering their prime home buying years.
Might be a really good buying point at $168.15
Their July Yr over yr home sales are down. Not a good short term sign but this company is solid so they will recover in time
RH short squeeze in action LGIH and SAFM time is coming.
"The only negative is we are growing too fast, plus a couple of downgrades were put out the last few days (downgrade because we went up too fast). I am sure this will be all over soon. I still think now is a good opportunity to get in. and still think the price will hit 90+ by the end of this year."
new all time high. Technical barriers breached FULL STEAM AHEAD!!!!! $90 today $110 by next month sometime.
We should see bounce back from now on. A ridiculous selloff by good earnings!!!
LGIH best home builder because of that sweet GROWTH. 66% growth not bad and that is next qtr not MAY 8th all months 60% plus growth I know raw cost BUT higher prices on homes.
Why the big drop in price?
"I just dipped my toe in the water. Been watching this for a while and with earnings of $6-7 as the latest estimate they are trading at a p/e below 10. Keep in mind that the $6-7 provided is based on home closings of 6,000 - 7,000. Well guess what, through April they've already closed on over 3k homes (1,244 as reported in Q1 + another 1,850 in April as reported 1 week ago). That means they have 9 months to double what they've done in 3 months in order to hit the $6-7 estimate. My guess is that this is management conservatism and they will blow away the full year numbers."
"LGIH should stop guidance altogether because they are very bad at it. I mean they as much admit that the guidance they give has nothing to do with the way the business is going or the way they see it.here is a quote from the transcript from the CEO""We want to be shocked if we don't produce great numbers in the third and fourth quarter, but that's not how we give guidance."" So they give the news that would be bad enough to be shockingly bad to them as what they expect. Unless the world is falling down around you, it is reasonable to assume things will be better than this ""shocking"" level.I have been on a few BOD's and have seen this philosophy and in my opinion it is not the way to manage a business . It is vert transparent what they are doing but the financial analysts are really just a bunch of lemmings/hacks that do not see clearly enough to see what the MO of the low guidance every year by management. is here. For example with the blowout earnings they showed this week only 1 of 7 analysts have updated their expectations and at the low end they are predicting a very significant drop in EPS in the upcoming quarters. The low end expects earnings of just over $5 the last half while last year they made $8. So they expect with the hot market they are in (and you know July already has a strong month of 930 units at record breaking prices and Gross margin, with at least the next several months locked in vat that level. It makes no sense they will make $18 easy and analysts just can add up a few numbers. If you look at history it is clearly obvious that the low level of guidance is what they do all the time the analysts never like it, the stock drops at the Q meeting and then gains ground when everyone realizes the numbers are really pretty great. ITo sum this up if you dont buy this stock at $158 you are a fool. It will be $200+ before thend of this quarter.BTW if you are interested a few weeks ago I calculated the numbes for the quareter and pretty much nailed if you care."
Btw I counted 8 new communities announced in July I wonder if that is a record
LGIH is a VGM stock
42% not bad the worst qtr of the year is coming outlook.
52% GROWTH FEB yoy NOT BAD and still growing sweet
"The entire homebuilding sector is commoditized, which is why this thing is off after a spectacular quarterly report--Investors hate rate hikes. LGIH stands out among it's industry peers as an outperformer. Because of the primary demographic it serves, CEO says it has room to scale in a rising rate environment. With the 2018 hurricane season projected to be another doozy, LGIH could continue to benefit."
