SILENCE............. So what will be the one time hit on earnings having accountants spend many MONTHS revising financials??? Then there are the legal costs...... Most ALL senior management has been replaced....Only positive I see is cleaning the place up for a sale.
"Assuming HAIN is unable to sell itself outright for a reasonable price, HAIN should start offloading some of their lesser brands. This would bring in a a bit of cash while allowing them to focus marketing efforts on their better brands."
"Something to think about… Michael McGuinness – Hain’s Chief Accounting Officer – has been with the company for 2 quarter end reporting periods. McGuinness was Monster Worldwide Inc.’s CFO and departed in February ‘16. A week later Monster filed a Form 8K regarding accounting issues / adjustments relating to operations cash flow guidance. There was a big swing from a positive to a Negative in operating cash flow of $ 25 to $ 40 million. McGuiness work history covers several companies that had accounting irregularities. He had been in finance at Symbol Technologies that had major revenue recognition issues, restatements and government investigations. Also, he was the Global Revenue Controller at Verint Systems that had internal control and accounting issues regarding revenue recognition. It is also interesting that Hain’s current top 3 Finance officers – Pat Conte, McGuinness & James Langrock - all had worked together in senior finance positions at Symbol Technologies during the same time that the company was experiencing significant accounting irregularities. While the Board’s review of controls is proceeding, it just makes you wonder…"
Another potential ding to Hain 's performance that does not seem to have gotten much attention on the board.https://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2018/01/17/the-new-whole-foods-adopts-one-of-old-grocerys-most-condemned-practices/
"CNBC Cramer has hosted his guest, the CEO of HAIN, many times on his show over the last 5 years. The stock keeps going DOWN anyway. What happened to the big organic and vegan trend line ?"
"UNFI the largest distributor of HAIN products announced today that they will buy SVU (Supervalu) a distributor to over 3,000 stores. This should increase the distribution network for HAIN products."
If you look at the 5 year chart..... The stock has not done well since August of 2015 when it fell from its high and has not performed well since. IF the company is starting to perform better then this would be a perfect time for a BUYOUT !!!
Someone please buy out this company.
"Engaged Capital sold about $65 million dollars’ worth of RCII on 8/20/18, I wonder what Glen is doing with the money. According to EX-10.1 of HAIN 10-K, Engaged capital has a standstill provision preventing them from owning no more than 14.9% of HAIN. They can buy up to additional 3.8 million shares of HAIN. With the company raising EBITA and sales guidance for next year even with 400 fewer SKU’s, how can they lose? The HPP sale would just be the gravy on the top."
"these guys r losers. i should sell but ive hung on this long, i guess ill give it 2 more weeks. sux to be lied to tho."
HAIN reached a new 52 Week Low at $21.53
can we breach $23?!

"With JBMA sold last week, Engaged Capital / Glenn Welling can put more focus on sales of TIVO and HAIN"
Good earnings and good momentum. They seem to be delivering and it will take time but headed in the right direction.

Hain Celestial reached a 52 Week high at 28.64
Why is Hain down?
"HAIN would make a good fit to a number of larger players, including GIS, HKC, NSRGY, POST, K, MKC & SJM. Nestle would probably be the best match, but the acquisition would be too small to make an meaningful impact. KHC would probably be the most interesting, since they have owned 20% of HAIN in the past. It would increase KHC business by about 10%, and give them a nice entry into the baby food market in the US. KHC has been entering the baby food markets in Canada, UK and other countries."
careful - sounds like diamond food 90.37 bottomed at 13.25 - it took almost a year to bottom out. Diamond was eventually sold for 40.46 a share
"Earnings from HAIN are showing growth and margin improvement. With Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods during that quarter, HAIN’s largest customer their was a lot of “noise” over changes at Whole Foods. Going forward the sale environment at Whole Foods is growing more rapidly due to the amazon effect."

need a buyout here...nothing else gonna make this move up at this point
Get the stupid things filed... A bunch of junior accountants could have filed them by now!
"A week or so ago, HAIN completed its divesture of Arrowhead Mills and SunSpire.""...for $15 million subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The transaction includes the Arrowhead Mills manufacturing facility in Hereford, TX and its employees.""I always thought Arrowhead packaging was extremely dated and not inviting. $15M for both brands and a manufacturing facility, AND Arrowhead's employees! (seemed oddly phrased)"
Nice earnings beat and great margin improvement!
"The accounting issues were that they booked sales when the products went to the supplier versus sold in stores. Sell off seems over done. Seems like someone wants to drive it down to get in cheap, this company is going to get bought out, wait for some activist to come in and shake up the board"
"Just more disappointment... I continue to hold my small in the red position, but do so reluctantly at this point. Aside from buyout potential, what other catalysts are out there at this point? None that I can see..."

"Shares of The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAIN) climbed 14.1% in November, according to data from S&P; Global Market Intelligence, after the organic and natural packaged foods specialist returned to growth in its latest quarter.That's not to say Hain's rise happened all at once. Rather, the stock's gradual climb last month began in earnest after it announced that fiscal first-quarter 2018 revenue had climbed 3.9%, to $708.3 million. That was well above Wall Street's average estimate for $697 million and reversed year-over-year declines of 2% and 1% in the fiscal 2017 third and fourth quarters, respectively.On the bottom line, Hain's adjusted net income per share skyrocketed more than 64% to $0.23, matching investors' expectations."
hain FINALLY has Positive !!!news!
Nice 5-day chart.
Only IDIOTS PANIC and sell down 25% plus.
So the big question is will they be delisted tonight since they missed the deadline or will they be given one more week to 6/22? Perhaps delisting is what HAIN is wanting?.?
Looks like Carson Block missed this one. Doesnt mean its not a smoking gun thought. Sure makes you think this is the tip of the iceberg of things to come with other companies accounting practices when a company like HAIN pulls this kinda stuff...Well at least someone will be making a fortune....the law firmsA
"UNFI, the largest distributor of HAIN products, reported 10.3% increase in net sales for the year ending July 2018, demonstrating sustained strong demand for UNFI's product assortment which include HAIN products. Sales to Whole Foods, the only Supernatural customer, was up 27.5% for the quarter and 21.4% for the year. How is this bad for HAIN?"

Hain has now received a non-compliance delisting letter from Nasdaq. This letter was received only shortly after Hain submitted a formal notification to the SEC of its’ inability to file an annual report 10K. The stock has seen an over 30% sell off in share price since Hain announced it was indefinitely delaying its earnings release. Is there an estimate of a time period for these type of board investigations to conclude? Do we know which law firm has been retained by Hain's board to conduct the investigation?
"Lots of key words here for the trader wanting to take an initial position on speculation of HC being sold, (activist, M&A, six dissident directors, Welling, sale of the PP division) and Nestles, Hormel, General Mills, Kraft and others hovering about and wanting to bump up their exposure in the organic food sector. I haven't been in this sector for sometime, does any wise investor know what the recent industry average (M&A) in the organic food space is producing for sales percentage over book value? Ok, I nibbled/started a position this morning. Good luck all!"
"I realize HAIN's P/E is a bit rich based on recent performance, but I have to believe there's value to be had for any number of potential acquirers.

Let's see how good the new guy is. Also interested in getting a feel for how much time the new guy has left on the game clock.
"If HAIN uses the proceeds from the sale of the protein business to buy back shares, it can reduce the share count by about 20% and increase the EPS by about 25%. Currently the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million in stock. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had not repurchased any shares under this program."

"Nice to see some insider buys done a week or so ago.Mostly modest dollar amounts, but still noticeable since most insider buys are via option exercises and not direct buys as these were."
"Obviously, this was not just a one quarter issue. They had problems going back several quarters and possibly years refiling of Q's and K's, not trivial. Will be interesting to see what the real growth rate is after the restatement. The issue described was one the computer industry addressed 20 years ago, so hard to believe the CFO was not on top of this. He should probably be fired!"

"very short term no opinion, but for somebody who has owned an organic food company for 30 years and know this industry very well, I expect Hain to be bought out in a reasonable time. I sell covered calls against part of my position while I wait."
The other day I re-looked at Blue Buffalo (BUFF).I was surprised that BUFF's market cap is significantly greater than HAIN's:$4.7B v $3.9BNot sure if I want to take a position in BUFF (it had a nice day yesterday post Citi coment).One thing I like about BUFF's products is that there is commonality of the name--Blue Buffalo.HAIN? Lots of brand names. I've always felt HAIN had too many BRANDS. Bearitos Blue Corn Chips; Garden of Eatin' Blue Corn Chips (both made with organic corn). It's a wonder that HAIN has the trading volume it continues to have given there's not much info (to put it lightly) to trade on...
There must be some kind of funny accounting arithmetic.Usually these actions discover more problems that several past year sneed to be restated that go on extension over en extension of fillings.I had several companies like that and I got burned because of my good will to trust them. No more!

"PEG is now 1.49. ""Because HAIN is in the Food Products industry and has positive earnings, the PEG, PE, and Price to Book ratios are the most appropriate valuation measures. The Price to Sales ratio is less instructive than the PEG or PE since the company has positive earnings. Therefore HAIN seems inexpensive with a PEG value of 1.49x, below the Food Products industry median PEG of 3.39x, although their PE is 19.67x, above the industry median of 19.42x."""

Engaged buying again?
"Sad to say but, the market is putting HAIN in the same basket as GIS. General Mills is pursuing its Consumer First strategy and executing against its three key global growth priorities to drive consistent topline growth that includes portfolio of natural and organic food brands. GIS reported 3% growth in natural and organic products well above the growth in the core brands. HAIN is where GIS wants to be."
"Re PEP earnings:""PepsiCo that about 45 percent of its net revenue now came from ""guilt-free"" products - beverages that have fewer than 70 calories per 12 ounces and snacks that have lower amounts of salt and saturated fat.PepsiCo's healthier brands include Propel flavored-water, Naked Cold Pressed juice and its ""Simply"" line of foods featuring products such as organic salsa and chips made from black beans, which have helped drive sales in recent quarters.The company said it was expanding its offerings of baked chips, which include Baked Lays and Baked Cheetos, to more markets outside the United States.""Consumers want healthy and these companies have to give them what they want,"" Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said.""""Naked Cold Pressed juice"" I was somewhat suspicious of HAIN's buy of BluePrint. Will cold pressed juices be a passing fad or a stalwart category? Obviously PEP has more bucks to market its products and to boot, I'd say the ""Naked"" brand has much more visibility than ""Blueprint""--I never liked that name, but the packaging is pretty good. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever seen a print (and obviously never a television commercial) advertisement for any HAIN product.....I'm long both HAIN & PEP; my position in HAIN once was valued significantly more than my PEP position, but no longer LOL."
"Good afternoon, I don't think anyone will buy HAIN for at least one year. The acquirer will wait to make sure there are no more issues th the accounting and they are able to deliver growth."

"It is utterly ridiculous how long this is taking. Having served in a senior corporate finance position, there is no excuse for ANY restatement taking this long! Totally incompetent staff and weak audit partner. Pretty soon we are going to be done with the March qtr and we are going to have to wait until they get the 10q done for this qtr....talking end of April.. Come on HAIN, just get the news out and move on! If the CFO is not replaced, huge mistake!"
maybe someone would like to buy Hain but the accounting issues never seem to stop.

"It should be noted that the directors/insiders that have purchased their shares in the last 3 months are holding onto their shares. They have not sold their shares. They have NOT SOLD their shares. They are required to disclose/file SEC form 4 to inform the public of any sale of their stock. Looking at SCE form 4 revealed the net purchases at 17, 108, 871 shares bought to 1613 shares sold. Bottom line, management/ insiders know that HAIN value has NOT yet been unlocked, that is why they are holding onto their shares. Have no fear. Insiders are not afraid. They have been buying. No need to fear. I am hoping that we’ll get the big news in June 2019. Have a great weekend!!!!"

"I walked into a WFM near work yesterday and there was no escaping the Bearitos Cheddar Puffs promotion.While the size of the promotion was large, it was the new package artwork that I couldn't miss: solid orange bag with a bear face. Hopefully this packaging update translates better than the Celestial Seasonings one just a few years ago.I've contended that HAIN had TOO MANY BRANDS, some with redundant products (Garden of Eatin' Blue Corn chips & Bearitos Blue Corn Chips.From recently updated WSJ--FINALLY seeing the light???:""MR. SIMON: We are focusing on our top 11 brands, which make up about 93% of our sales. We are taking out products and brands that are declining. We are also focused on growing our distribution. If you take our top products, we probably only have distribution in 35% [of all potential stores], so there is a lot of white space for us to grow in the U.S. We also recently announced we are looking to sell our Hain Pure Protein business, which sells organic and hormone-free chickens to grocery and natural-food retailers. There are probably some other brands that we are looking to divest. Putting our focus on our biggest brands with the highest margins makes more sense than dabbling with some of our smaller brands.""It appears India & China is where HAIN may grow....""WSJ: What are Hain’s growth plans?MR. SIMON: The opportunity for us to expand into India and China is tremendous. All they want is Western baby products and Western personal-care products.WSJ: How do you deal with Hain being an acquisition target?Mr. Simon: There is a lot of energy and a lot of fight left in me, but as a fiduciary responsibility, you have to make sure you have the right people to help take you to the next level. I think the value is that if Hain was part of another company, it has a lot of great brands and products. There is tremendous demand for our products in China and tremendous opportunities, but we don’t have plants in China. If we were part of a company that had plants in China, it would be a lot easier.There are a lot of benefits being a part of a bigger company. Being a $3 billion-plus public company, when you hit a bump in the road you feel it. If you are a $50 billion or $60 billion company, you don’t get those."""

Why did HAIN go up for the last three days?
"Total inside Holdings is 2.49% majority of owners institutions, so when the buyer decided to commit it will be an easy takeover to accumulate enough shares for a buyout.

rumors of buyout?
Buyer at $25 - hese lawsuits and accounting issues will take a year or two.
I have never EVER seen a management team so incompetent with their inability to set a date and hit it! They should never be trusted again. They are a total joke and should sell the company to the highest bidder!
when my covered call expires today im selling first thing Monday morning. This company is garbage...gonna take a huge take loss and roll this into something better
this CEO is a pro .buying these shares and holding LT.debt lowered margins up.consolidating units .
Very strange! So they spend the better part of a year doing what?? Presumably reviewing every transaction for several years and find nothing needing restatement?? So was their initial press release a year ago completely bogus?? Never ever have I seen anything like this in my 40 years of investing and as a senior financial executive.. Not sure what to make of all this!
"One more prediction and I have no inside knowledge here, just looking at this management's track record....Don't be surprised if management fails to release financials by the June extension from Nasdaq and their banks."
Don't be surprised if the end of May comes and goes and HAIN has still not filed their financials!
SOOOOO many lawsuits! Are they all wrong?
"HAIN is significantly undervalued according to Simply Wall Street which puts HAIN at $34.11 per share. HAIN management/ insiders confirmed that per share value by purchasing 17, 108, 871 HAIN shares around $20 to $24 per share in the last 3 months. The company insiders basically put at least $342, 177, 420.00 of their own money (assuming at $20 per share) in the company. The only reason that they would put $342, 177, 420 on the line is that some event(s) is / are going to happen that will unlock HAIN real value.

"#$%$ Y.F....I wrote a somewhat detailed ON TOPIC post and it didn't stick?I referenced a decent article about HAIN and I had the FORESIGHT to create a separate post with the url, since Y.F. doesn't like it when regular posters include a link (but it is cool with BOT generated posts, since it is COMPLICIT with the originators of such posts)."
"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/12/14/hain-celestial-ceo-heres-how-were-benefiting-from-amazon-whole-foods.htmlwhen asked about possible buyout, Irwin totally evaded any answer, I am buying more. earning improving, organics demand going and earning should be in an upswing"
Engaged is even more engaged!
too much employee turnover and too many out of stocks to distributors.
"Who doesn't like market rumors?I just noticed on BloombergTV's ""scroll"" that Nestle is interested in HAIN. (haven't heard that before--sarcasm).Heck, HAIN has been in play for how many years?Time will tell."
"Engaged gotta make this work. Their fees ride on this working out. They have been in this for over a year and their cost basis is probably in the $30-32 range. They are down big against the market and this thing is the tail that wags the dog in the portfolio. If this is a dud, no ability to make money in their portfolio. Risk reward over next 12 months looks promising. Could be a 50% return if board/mgmt can execute. Can't afford hiccups since already behind schedule."
"When insiders start buying at the open market price it could indicate a turnaround.The problem right now is HAIN is over priced by over 90%, trading at 39 with a PEG ratio over 1.9.Divide the stock price by its PEG ratio to come up with a fundamentally realistic price. 39.35 / 1.9 = 20.71.Even at $21 /share the value is uncertain given the investigation may find more problems.I looked at the insider trading tracking place insidertrading and the insider activity is a nightmare.I usually pick up stocks when whacked but not this time."
One of my worst buy decisions. I waited years for a takeover.
If you are bullish on Hain like me here is food for thought:http://www.newhope.com/news/55-2018-could-bring-even-bigger-deals-cpg-aunt-fannies-gears-expansion?NL=NP-05&Issue=NP-05_20171220_NP-05_564&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_3_1&utm_rid=CNHNM000000665684&utm_campaign=24133&utm_medium=email
Anyone know why this is down so much on little volume ?
Every food stock that I have ever bought pays a decent dividend. IMHO part of the reason why there is no support level here is that there is no dividend to provide support and I don't recall HAIN ever instituting a buyback program for there stock. Even if they wanted to buy back their stock or pay a dividend I am not sure if their lines of debt would allow them to do same. Frankly I don't know where the bottom here is. But it certainly seems historically cheap at $20.73 !
Another nice day today. Love that Engaged Capital and big buy by Director. Boo Yah!
Sold my shares. Not worth to hold them.
Any talk of a BO?
“Silence is maad in heuen!” : )
Whats going on today?
"What a shock!No, not the election. I just saw an advertisement for a HAIN product; until today, I had never seen ANY advertising of a HAIN product. I was reading a dated article online from the Denver Post re legalization (my state passed legalization yesterday)...and there it was, a pop up ad on the screen for Sensible Portions Veggie Straws. I just searched ""sensible portions"" and discovered another redundant product: Sensible Portions Cheddar Puffs and Bearitos Cheddar Puffs. Not to be left out, Garden of Eatin' offers a similar product: Baked Cheddar Puffs. Sorry for the digression. Nice to see HAIN advertising; Veggie Straws? I'll pass."
"Sold my long calls yesterday but still own the long put. Got a sell signal late lest week from Fib Timer service on small caps, IWM, so figured I would take some profits. Still have my eye on this stock if it should weaken."
Anyone think this hits 25 by December 21st?
"Engaged Capital is now ""married"" to its Hain stake. Unsellable position right now. Reckless move to buy 10 per cent position with a cost base around 35"
Dilution just occurred to tune of three million shares. Form S8 just posted after close. Looks like stock sold for 17.51 a share.
I believe most stockholders would be over-joyed for a buyout at $60. Especially what they were put thru last year with the accounting issues !!!
"More dilution via exec incentive over potential to earn 740,000 shares by 2021. Less than 1% but still more dilution.Works for me since I sold Jan 21 puts and bought Jan 21 calls for wash transaction cost at $20 strike so I hope these boys are immensely successful."
Hain Celestial reached a 52 Week high at 29.58
"I would like to hear some good news. After 4 years, I think I'm entitled."
"I'm still a believer that this volume and price movement continues to be due to a large accumulation by an activist. A little house cleaning in the future sounds pretty good for me, I don't see this kind of movement caused by an upgrade."
Someone leaking earnings???
"Nice reaction to:""Activist-targeted Hain Celestial Group Inc. (HAIN - Get Report) founder and CEO Irwin Simon suggested to TheStreet's (TST) sister publication The Deal on Monday, April 30, that the maker of Terra Chips and other organic and vegetarian foods could be sold down the road because ""we're probably not the best guys to take it to the next level."""""
Plainview deal is done for $25 million and all liabilities. See 8k for terms and 19 month letter of credit for $10 million with interesting repayment term of 120% of amount used.
"Was a fun ride, but I'm out. They can announce the takeover now."
"FWIW, CPM has sold Bolthouse back to private equity (and its former owner) for $510MIn 2012, CPM paid $1.55B for Bolthouse."
HAIN reached a new 52 Week Low at $24.94
"Just received an email from Seeking Alpha:""Engaged Capital updates on portfolio holdings""""Increased stakes: Apogee Enterprises (APOG -0.7%), Benchmark Enterprises (BHE -0.2%), Hain Celestial (HAIN -1.1%)."""
HAIN reached a new 52 Week Low at $21.81
HAIN is up 5.15% to 25.31
The Hain Celestial is down 5.00% to 38.00
Forward p/e of 16.75 and peg over 2 is too high.
Again more good news .More good things to come !!!
"KHC has been slow to the changes of consumer tastes.Curiously, Heinz acquired Earth's Best in 1996.It sold Earth's Best to HAIN in 2000.And today, both companies are not firing on all cylinders...."
"Is this a Heinz target ? Selling planters gets 3,5 billion so they can raise the other cash and take HAIN- has a 4.4 b market cap . Add the premium 12 bill?"
"If you value HAIN with the same multiples as GIS, SJM and others are paying for pet food companies it would be worth significantly more. I guess pet foods complement GIS and SJM’s products, and there might be significant synergies. I would think HAIN’s unique business should be worth significantly more."
"For those who had CPB on your list of possible suitors of HAIN, if the below gets done, I'd say it's safe to say they should be crossed off the list!I wasn't aware that recently CPB bought Pacific Foods a product competitor of HAIN's Imagine Soup brand.HAIN: so MANY brands!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/campbell-soup-advanced-talks-acquire-210151555.html"
"June 25 – 8K: Succession involves “Cash separation payment equal to $34,294,688.00” - Successors: “any person or entity” - Timeline: “In the event that the Succession Date has not occurred by December 31, 2018”."
the new ceo needs to come out and announce something positive
"I experienced a split second of hope when I heard on CNBC during my ride to work that ""General Mills is buying natural......pet food company Blue Buffalo"". (much larger market cap than HAIN)Cross another possible suitor off the list?Execute!"
"$HAIN If You Did The DD,You Would Know It's Just Accounting Issues From Concession Granted to Distributors.Means Nothing.Buy Opportunity."
"Forget KHC and focus on the turnaround story in front of you. If you have not done so go and listen to the investor Dy presentation of today and the recognition by analysts of the transparency it represents. It’s a good story told by a CEO and his finance chief, one they have both executed before so they have a track record for this type of work. And yes the CEO and his VP’s incentives are aligned with our interests."
"Would love to see the company sell itself, it was a buyout target but the mgmt. didn't want to sell, now is a great time for a company to buy them out"
"This is crazy, they knew about this before"
news of sale of turkey operations soon will drive takeover talk on remainder of companyhedge fund buying more puts pressure for a sale
Heading to $27.00-$28.00
Buy under 20.00.Not much above book and not as big a write-off of good-will should the company receive a buy out offer.
It's going to eventually return back towards pre-accounting controversy levels
"This is what I am buying with my option investment in Hain. Nothing like a guy with a track record of improving operations to take the head job.Schiller has served in various executive positions at Pinnacle Foods Corporation since 2010, most recently as chief commercial officer. While at Pinnacle, he orchestrated a multi-year turnaround that resulted in record market share gains, sales growth, gross margin and profit growth, according to Hain Celestial.This just what the company needs.￼"
About 9.2 million shares of HAIN were short at the end of August. Almost 10% of the shares are short.
"Generally,it's best to short or avoid the stock of any company whose CEO appears on Cramer."
"ask Cramer he has that duche on all the time and how great his products are. let's hear it now just another long island company with accounting problems. Do I hear CA, Symbol, and the list goes on@!@!@@"
"Something is going on, either they have a buyer for pure protein or for entire company."
"Jeffries keeps a Buy rating on HAIN shares with a $50 price target.Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale says Hain Celestial is one step closer to resolving its accounting issue after its independent audit committee review was completed and found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing. The analyst continues to believe the accounting review should result in a non-material impact on earnings. According to Nielsen, Hain's sales growth for the latest four weeks ending November 5 was up 1.3%, which is encouraging, Jagdale tells investors in a research note."
long slow march to $30...
"If you value HAIN at the same multiples CAG is paying for PF it would also be worth over $50/share. In June of this year CAG agreed to pay about $10.9 Billion for PF with revenues of about $3 billion, and EBITDA of about $550 million. I also think HAIN has better prospects than PF. HAIN would make a good compliment to any large packaged food company. Someone should call up Glenn and tell him to get the deal done."
Lack of communication is unconscionable! I hope someone(s) is fired!!!!
Two days away and still nothing... Give me a break!
What happened?
"Hain Celestial’s (ticker: HAIN) largest shareholder just made a nearly $20 million bet that the packaged-foods company’s comeback will continue.Hedge fund Engaged Capital bought 1 million more shares of the maker of Celestial Seasonings teas and Earth’s Best baby food on Feb. 28 and March 1, paying an average per-share price of $19.30 each, according to a form Engaged filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Engaged now owns 12.8 million shares, a stake of 12.3%, according to S&P Capital IQ."
Cramer interviewed Schiller last night (12/8):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfErQ8zzJLc
"Hain need to market the pure protein products as pet foods. Market valuations would significantly increase, and would attract multiple buyers. What an irrational market."
"This clearly a turnaround story. Read the earnings transcript and you will learn a lot about the plan, the CEO and the Investor Day coming on the 27th.GLTA"
"Hain needs to release it earnings before Dec 27th per the convents of their loan obligations. My guess is that they but lease date for earrings soon. With the clearance no wrong doing, its a matter of Revenue recognition in another quarter, the stock should go back to $50 in the next week +. Heavy short interest will have the POP more severed. I am long HAIN for this reason."
4 mil. shares volume to upside after a downgrade????? Up all day? Could a buy out come this fast? Talk about very strange!
busting out !
I have worked in organic industry over 30 years and Hain brands will be worth lots to mainstream company. Very likely buyout much higher. Rumor Kroger interested in Whole Foods.
Let the activist accumulation continue (hopefully).
HAIN reached a new 52 Week Low at $21.06
"It must be some ""Quite Period"" no news, and all the buyers are checked out."
Engaged Capital buying more? They have been reckless buying so much at higher price so will they go all in like a gambler?
New CEO. That's good news. I hope they find someone really good with a track record of success.
"I was at a conventional super market yesterday and saw a new product (to me, at least) extension from....not HAIN, but GIS owned Annie's!The product? Breakfast cereals. I've been long HAIN for years and, for the most part, am content. That said, in the past I have described Irwin as a ""serial acquirer"" of companies and the result of buying many smallish brands may be haunting him and the company.As others have noted, if HAIN had one or two major brands that could be exploited, it probably would be a ""better"" acquisition target. HAIN is somewhat all over the map.Back to Annie's, it had (I believe) one well known brand (and a bunny!). I imagine being owned by GIS has been very beneficial to Annie's; shared research, marketing, distribution etc. From what I remember, Annie's was mostly kids' mac & cheese and some crackers. Now? YogurtCerealsoups & mealsfrozen foodscookie doughsalad dressingscondimentsAnd guess what?All of the above products are ""Annie's"" brand!How is Arrowhead doing?Cheers"
One word describes HAIN.. LOSER .How does this company do so poorly in the right space and at the right time? Please sell yourself and end the suffering.13 Quarters of misery for me.
Neither do I......
Need to sell the company . Management is clueless
"Look at the a side by side comparison of WWAV's products, market cap, cash, debt and book value, compared to Hain's, and, clearly, Danone is paying a large premium for WWAV. Hain, even if they are overestimating revenue, is a much better company.In the short run, Hain might drop to the low 30s, but it will prevail, on its own, or as a buyout candidate."
20 calls are buying grabbed up fast!!!
"If you value HAIN at the same multiples CPB paid for LNCE it would be worth over $50/share. In March of this year CPB paid $6 Billion for LNCE with revenues of $2.3 billion, and EBITDA of less than $200 million. I think HAIN has is better prospects than LNCE. HAIN should attract multiple buyers now that the stage is cleared with the CEO stepping down."
Lower than the accounting scandal almost two years ago. Wake up management!!
I'm out. Too risky now.
"I bought a small position in HAIN after the accounting SNAFU sent shares south last summer. I am more of a value investor and do not follow this name closely. I understand that recent momentum is a result of rumors that HAIN could be an acquisition target as well as an activist investor push to make changes to the Board. Am I missing anything here? For those of you whom follow this name more closely, what are your thoughts on price momentum? Will it continue? Thanks to all for your input!"
Can I suggest to stop selling to Amazon directly. It doesn't help selling a ton of product directly to them and then they just discount the #$%$ out of it online. Then a store manager looks at those prices and can't compete. Hain is completely sacrificing the bottom line just to meet a top line. Hain needs to take control of their brand and brand messaging online to get online pricing back to parity with retail. The quickest and best way to do that is to take control of your own darn brands and be self aware of how damaging Amazon pricing is to the retailers. All Hain has to do is simply ask themselves a very simple question...are these brands our brands or Amazon's brands?
"Engaged, nor Irwin, sold any shares during 3Q. I'm wondering if Engaged has sold any shares since then.9/30/19Engaged was long 21,068,777 shares, or 20.19%Meanwhile our buddy Irwin was long 1,712,773 shares"

Please sell this company. 3 years of disappointment. Best play. Tax write-off.
"Isn't it great when the powers that be at Y.F. decide to delete a ""normal"" post?Last Friday, I posted a LINK to a story headlined:""Amazon has committed to roughly $22 billion in future food purchases as it bulks up Whole Foods""(Google key words, if interested)Last paragraphs are posted below.For those in the know, is the following a negative, neutral or positive for HAIN?""He pointed to another benefit to Amazon maintaining a close relationship with UNFI: access to health and personal care products.Through its Select Nutrition subsidiary, UNFI says it sells ""more than 14,000 health and beauty aids, vitamins, minerals and supplements."" Hansen speculates that Amazon is trying to get better access to those types of products and expand the rapidly growing health and personal care category.According to One Click Retail, Amazon's health and wellness sales grew 30 percent last year, bringing the total segment to $2.5 billion.""It shows a very strong commitment to its health and personal care category,"" Hansen said. ""It's Amazon's way of getting direct access to brands."""""
"It depends who you believe. Price cut to $25.00/share price target, price target raise to $28/share, price target cut to $29/share maintains market perform , no it's neutral. So believe in yourself, these self promoting analysts have their interest placed first before yours. You can guess too."
Is HAIN every going to turnaround? I have done well with UA and OLED turnarounds but HAIN has been a bad buy.
