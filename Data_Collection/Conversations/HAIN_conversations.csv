"If you value HAIN at the same multiples CPB paid for LNCE it would be worth over $50/share. In March of this year CPB paid $6 Billion for LNCE with revenues of $2.3 billion, and EBITDA of less than $200 million. I think HAIN has is better prospects than LNCE. HAIN should attract multiple buyers now that the stage is cleared with the CEO stepping down."
"Something is going on, either they have a buyer for pure protein or for entire company."
"Sad to say but, the market is putting HAIN in the same basket as GIS. General Mills is pursuing its Consumer First strategy and executing against its three key global growth priorities to drive consistent topline growth that includes portfolio of natural and organic food brands. GIS reported 3% growth in natural and organic products well above the growth in the core brands. HAIN is where GIS wants to be."
"With JBMA sold last week, Engaged Capital / Glenn Welling can put more focus on sales of TIVO and HAIN"
"If HAIN uses the proceeds from the sale of the protein business to buy back shares, it can reduce the share count by about 20% and increase the EPS by about 25%. Currently the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million in stock. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had not repurchased any shares under this program."

"Bought yesterday @$21.50. I wish I found out about this stock much earlier. I bought $STKL 2 weeks ago and searched for a stock that deals with organic food like $STKL and found HAIN. Like HAIN, there are several insiders buying $STKL."
"#$%$ Y.F....I wrote a somewhat detailed ON TOPIC post and it didn't stick?I referenced a decent article about HAIN and I had the FORESIGHT to create a separate post with the url, since Y.F. doesn't like it when regular posters include a link (but it is cool with BOT generated posts, since it is COMPLICIT with the originators of such posts)."
"UNFI the largest distributor of HAIN products announced today that they will buy SVU (Supervalu) a distributor to over 3,000 stores. This should increase the distribution network for HAIN products."

"Well what do you know?In an effort to make its product less beneficial, the powers that be have deleted a post of mine that solely had a link to an article about....Hain Celestial!If interested, search ""Inside Hain Celestial's fight to regain its swagger"" and voila!"
"Irwin has a $34 million incentive to leave the company, finding the right CEO might be harder than finding the right entity. The entity taking over this company can improve the bottom line by 5-10% by just cutting the pay of the executives and the directors."
This board remains eerily quiet.Earnings out tomorrow (8/26) A.M.Estimate: 0.392 v 0.31 last year. HAIN has had earnings surprises for the past eleven Qs.6 Buys5 Holds1 Sell12 Mo target: 44.00
"why is this stock up 7% today? 1 yr high was during Covid lockdown, when ready to healthy meals were popular. So now it is up again and it is not about tea. last qtr they missed their target and now whats up?"
"If you value HAIN at the same multiples CAG is paying for PF it would also be worth over $50/share. In June of this year CAG agreed to pay about $10.9 Billion for PF with revenues of about $3 billion, and EBITDA of about $550 million. I also think HAIN has better prospects than PF. HAIN would make a good compliment to any large packaged food company. Someone should call up Glenn and tell him to get the deal done."
rumors of buyout?
"Who could buy? I don't think Pepsi is the right fit. Nestle should be the right company, however the General Mills and Conagra too might be the right fit. They all need right fit. Since they have been in the market for a while, we should see someone buying them up soon.It could be even on Monday, you need to have the shares when the Buyout happens.GL!"
"Engaged Capital sold about $65 million dollars’ worth of RCII on 8/20/18, I wonder what Glen is doing with the money. According to EX-10.1 of HAIN 10-K, Engaged capital has a standstill provision preventing them from owning no more than 14.9% of HAIN. They can buy up to additional 3.8 million shares of HAIN. With the company raising EBITA and sales guidance for next year even with 400 fewer SKU’s, how can they lose? The HPP sale would just be the gravy on the top."

"HAIN would make a good fit to a number of larger players, including GIS, HKC, NSRGY, POST, K, MKC & SJM. Nestle would probably be the best match, but the acquisition would be too small to make an meaningful impact. KHC would probably be the most interesting, since they have owned 20% of HAIN in the past. It would increase KHC business by about 10%, and give them a nice entry into the baby food market in the US. KHC has been entering the baby food markets in Canada, UK and other countries."
