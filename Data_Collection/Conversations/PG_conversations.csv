I don't want to use a product that makes me feel bad about myself. Watched the ad and it does just that. Why would a business want to do such a thing to its main customer group?
PG with a PE of 27 compared to a company such as Pepsi with a PE of 15.
"What will come first, $83 or $103? I'll stay Money Market until $83 after selling at $93.47...Are consumers tapped and living paycheck to paycheck?"
What will the new dividend be when announced next month?Will PG meet analysts earnings estimates?
Dollar shave club will be happy to take my money
P&G is a great stock to invest in.. It will reach 160 by the end of the year with a steady growing dividend :)) Happy
"Very good earnings on top and bottom line, forecasts growth in a difficult market. Strong and steady, why would you sell at 104? Be my guest, you can right now, not me, there is more upside than down side for PG"
"PG is closing in on a full retracement of its August 2015 low of about $67. No idea if it will go even lower, but I’m confident that it is nearing the red line where big changes will be kicking in at PG. Major divestiture/aquisition moves, significant employee downsizing and organizational restructuring will all be on the table."
"This will be a dividend cash cow for many, many years in my portfolio "
"There is very little love out there for this stock right now. Volumes are way down and it cannot seem to get any traction to make a move back to the mid 120,s or even high teens . Earnings were good and wondering if this is corna virus related or the fact the company lowered expectations a point from 4 - 5 to 3 -4 ? Year ends June 30th. and should be good, but seems to not matter what the numbers say ."
PG looking into buying CLX? Has anyone else heard about this possibility or is it just made up?
"Morgan Stanley is very positive to PG and gave it ""Overweight"" rating on 2020-04-21. The price target was set to $125.00 - $134.00."
Should hear the new dividends increase within the next month. Maybe around $.85 per quarter
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Solid as a rock.
Target and WalMart report stellar earnings.I think both are stocked with lots of PG merch
"Any thoughts on what P&G could get if they sold Gillette? Original purchase was about 57 billion, Buffett picked off Duracell for roughly 6.5 billion in stock and cash and last year P&G took a 8 billion write off. Thoughts on should P&G sell Gillette?"
Bought at $127.00...got orders in today for $127 and $126.00 today...irresistible
Definitely new CEO
"At the current dividend, #$%$ equates to a 4.0% yield. That's competitive with fixed income investments and could represent a bottom."
PG has broken above the 100 day MA for the first time since January 22nd on the daily chart.
Both the daily & weekly charts looks positive for P&G. Look for nice upside (approx. 12%) by end of year -- $154 price target.
PG raised dividend today by 4% to $2.98/year
will we see $80 again by Xmas?
Elderly investors rejoice today.
Spend $100 on P&G products at Costco and get a $25 cash card (limit 2).
WHAT A STOCK FOR GROWTH AND DIVIDEND.
"LOL at the P&G Kool-Aid that you longs are buying on Gillette's $8B writedown.From the 2018 year-end annual report:""Indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. ""As of year-ended June 30, 2018....from the annual report (form 10-K filing)""as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years""The foreign exchange nonsense that the CEO spouted is dubious at best for the $8B writedown. The auditors would never have cleared an existing impairment of $8B that existed in 2005 from ""foreign exchange"" for the 2018 statements. The bulk should have already been accounted for as implied in the 2018 note since the auditors were are of this significant adjustment....and you won't accumulate $8B of f-ex on goodwill in a year.It's clear that something else is recently plaguing Gillette.....now what could that possibly be?!!?!?"
"This company has managed to survive two world wars and countless other difficulties, to think it won't come back from the coronavirus is just plain wrong. This is a great opportunity to get a true blue chip company at a discount. IMO"
"Holy Batman. A 10% increase in the dividend. Thank you good folks at P&G.Company Release - 4/13/2021CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.8698 per share on the Common Stock and on the Series A and Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock of the Company, payable on or after May 17, 2021, to Common Stock shareholders of record at the close of business on April 23, 2021, and to Series A and Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock shareholders of record at the start of business on April 23, 2021. This represents a 10% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend."
"Think I will buy a few hundred shares, simply given the fact I worked for this company in the late '80's and sold my shares too early back in the day. This is a ""great American company"" that every portfolio should own. You may never get rich but you won't get burned, either. Nice dividends. Great products."
"Great dividend stock for retires, increase in dividends every year, another increase next quarter. Oh yea, we love their products too!"
"The *ONLY* problem with PG is its share price. Like Apple, many day traders have started trading it. This is why when Big Tech is up, MSFT and AAPL are generally up higher than AMZN and TSLA. Traders would rather use $30K on a $130 stock than using it on a $3K stock. Unfortunately, this creates short term volitility. This is the onyl downside to PG.Other than that, if you are a long term holder, PG is the safest investment on the market. Always has been and always will be. Guaranteed 5-10%/year. That may not look great, especially over the past year...but all bubbles burst. It's only a matter of time. And when it does, all these traders will lose most of what they will have made. PG, though, will still stand tall.Oh, one last thing. The Citi price cut dragged down the price from $139 to $131. Guess what? Their PT is still $150, and that's on the low side of the spectrum. I'm not worried about PG at all. 100% of my money is in PG (around $40K), and it's for the long haul. I put aside $500-1,000/month and put it into PG every month. Why? People would say this is risky. It isn't. PG is the only company that cannot be overtaken, at least within the next 30-50 years. Their distribution network is too strong. Their partnerships are too strong. Their moat is just too big. My family made millions (literally) on PG alone. I am following in their footsteps."
"Short-term traders... PG will prevail long term. They've done all the right things for their CPG business model. I.e., reducing expenses, buying back shares, pivoting on their marketing focus, increasing on-line order volume. You should all do what's right for your portfolio."
this is one of my I don't worry about stocks though it is confusing as to why the price is down when it should be climbing but I think the next quarterly results will look really good and overall annual will continue to be a steady performer

great stock steady upward since I bought last may
Cleansing supply division red hot. Stores are near empty every day of PG products.
A hike of 3.95 %
Even HE is complaining about the price increases recently initiated by PGWell he has taken a pay cut in 2021 I guess.
"True, as RSI is <=30 these r algos that have already programmed to cycle out of value stocks like PG & into more growth & risky stocks due to cheap money ( low interest rates + QE + stimulus etc )..Value stock slike PG r the best place to be in right now, not to much beta ( volatilty ) but stable & growing,, Great point to get in , Will surely revert back to the mean of the Bollinger bands of 137+ in 2 to 3 weeks max..."

"The trend is your FRIEND,Procter & Gamble Company (The) lies in the lower part of a weak rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good buying opportunity. A break down the bottom trend line at $103.01 will firstly indicate a slower raising rate, but may also be a early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 6.25% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $109.45 and $116.55 at the end of this period."
Excellent results. Onward and upward.
Sold all shares today. Didn't realize this company deals in politics.
"I feel like I want to sell some when I see it so close to a 52 week high, then I see the div is still 2.5% which is pretty darn good for so little risk. So I hold."
"Procter & Gamble (ticker: PG) is up 10.8% in 2020, while the Dow has gained 6.3%.Although P&G began the year with an earnings miss, it has delivered three strong reports since. The shares didn’t react much in April, as demand for cleaning products was hampered by concerns about a strong dollar and the uncertain outlook at the start of the pandemic.Yet the company has been raising its dividend while continuing share repurchases, and its July results showed that even economic uncertainty couldn’t dampen sales of its portfolio of premium cleaning products. The company turned in another strong quarter in October, as organic sales continued to shine.Naturally, 2021 will present a challenge for P&G, as the receding threat of the virus will take some focus off cleaning. Yet others argue that the standard for cleaning will permanently be higher post-pandemic, to the benefit of P&G and peers. In addition, P&G has historically had one of the higher organic growth rates in the staples industry. Those metrics will certainly fall a bit in 2021, but if it can continue to show that it’s resonating with consumers, the shares need not fade with Covid.Analysts seem fairly bullish about P&G. Of the 24 analysts tracked by FactSet, 62% have a Buy rating or the equivalent, while a third are Hold-rated and there is one bearish call. The average analyst price target is $153.05"
"The local Kroger store in Cincinnati can't keep up with bounty paper towels and Charmin TP, wonder if folks in other parts of the country are experiencing the same things? I understand the Mehopany plant that makes these is running 3 shifts 7 days a week already."
I plan on selling my share of Shopify and taking 10+ shares of PG. Slow and steady wins the race.
"Guys it’s not a conspiracy against you, it’s called “sector rotation” Clorox is dropping too.PG spiked during COVID and now is going down as Wall Street moves on to different sectors, (EV, semiconductors, Oil, etc)Coming here and whining everyday or blaming the CEO won’t change anything. Either day trade and move in and out of stocks quickly to profit off trends or buy and hold long term and stop obsessing over every downturn"
"April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targetson several U.S.-listed companies,* P&G : Citigroup cuts price target to $150 from $165* P&G : Citigroup cuts to neutral from buy* P&G : Jefferies raises target price to $168 from $167* P&G : JP Morgan cuts price target to $147 from $148"
I sold 60% of P&G stock at the beginning of the year and bought the indexes. My index mix is up 10%. Does anyone know how P&G performed since January 1st ?

"Just bought my first 2 shares, will add slowly for the next decade"
"Not understand the dip lately at all. Makes no sense considering their dividend, earnings report and the current economic situation in regards to their products"
"Strong quarter, and conservative set-up for next quarter. For us longs, the caution is that we're nearing 52 week highs, and we'll likely see resistance at $128, which is where people have been taking profits. Ex-div day is next week, so people will be thinking twice about selling their shares so they don't lose the .79/share div. Soooooo, I'm gonna sell covered calls in the $126-128 range that expire on 4/24. Importantly, the limit will need to be above the dividend price. This way, I'll essentially capture the dividend immediately, and I'll take profits if the shares get assigned. Then when the shares drop back down to low 120's... I buy again!!! :-)"
"Great to see this stock being appreciated again by Wall Street. Great products, huge revenue, nice dividend. Has everything an investor should value."
"If anyone wants to see truly brilliant marketing look up ""What is a man? A response to Gillette"" in youtube. I haven't worn a watch in 15 years but now I just might buy an Egard xD"
"you folks understand that their earnings report will likely be positive and analysts will attribute it to the success of this add, further pushing the agenda that we are all nuts and they had it right all along? regardless, I will make a point of avoiding PG products as much as I can."
I'm seeing incredible Inflation. Are you? It's real like really in my view.

"Markets explode upwards today, P&G falls! What else is new? How do the bums running this company keep their jobs? I make more money on my checking account."
JM knows how to drive this up
"Underperforming because the rest of the market is just too exciting right now, it’s the only reason why. When the market isn’t green every day people will move back into stocks like PG. Selling millions of products every day, all products found in essential stores. Q2 will be staggering."
"Quiz: If you had $10,000.00 to invest six months ago, would you have been better off buying P&G stock, or hiding it in your mattress? Take your time......."
I see a lot of speculation about a split? It seems to me that having a stock price over a hundred dollars per share seems to the in-thing right now. I'm not gonna hold my breath about a split.
"The real reason that PG is surging today was completely missed by the main stream analysts! A little over a decade ago, I was retiring from GE and fortunately made the decision to diversify away from a very nice chunk of GE stock! One of my investments in that process was 500 shares of PG. It did fine over that period, however in recent years it was underperforming most of my portfolio. I stuck with it because of it had always been a conservative and defensive position. What ever possessed me yesterday afternoon is unknown, however, I sold my entire PG position after holding for over a decade! Headline today....PG HAS BEST ONE DAY PERFORMANCE IN OVER A DECADE....LOL! This is absolutely a true story. I hope all of you who reading this are happy PG longs! Have a great day and good luck in your investments!"
"The last time P&G stock kept falling day after day on up markets like it has been doing, with no news to compell it to continually drop Trian fund was selling off part of their millions of shares, Wouldn't be surprised to see them doing it again."
"Up $10 in the last month, a nice little run. It's always interesting to me to see how the market responds to an earnings report. Sometimes it seems like a significant beat doesn't get the love you expect. I think the forward guidance is the single most important factor for the price a couple of days post earnings."
Sold PG and bought UN. (Dollar Shave Club parent)...
Wow! I think this might break 100...
PG revenue declining last 4 quarters. They need to make some changes.
PG is up around 11% the last year. You also can't beat a strong dividend yield of 2.52%. Increases dividends yearly. Looking to buy up a strong position with PG and let it sit for 20 + years.
"I find it funny but not surprising at all the comments regarding the slight drop in P&G today. If there was any stock to ignore the short-term moves it would be P&G. Most shareholders of P&G don't worry about the daily, monthly, or even yearly moves of the stock. Our holding period is measured in decades."
I've owned this stock for literally 20 years. I keep adding. Just hold it forever. it's the foundation of my portfolio and has made me a millionaire.
Stock buybacks will bring PG back to 137+ were it is supposed to be.
My grandmother worked for P&G and started me off with 30 shares in 1979. I reinvested all the dividends and with all the stock splits and adding here and there and hopefully one more stock split I'll be really happy.
"The Tide has turned. Olay .., olay, olay, olayI Luvs the premarket Nice Bounce P&G!I Always had faith Maybe this is a new Dawn?Good Gain & My Joy!!"
I'm just a lowly bystander who bought PG back just before it split in the late 90's.. All I know is that for people who are in stocks for the long haul and not the wanna be overnight millionaires this is the kind of stock to buy and hold. I wish more companies ran the way this one does..
"TP, NyQuil, and other items made by PG are sold out of almost every store in the country. Earnings is going to be exceptionally good this quarter..."
"P&G stock down about 13 % so far this year, but hey P&G got an award for the parking lot design at Mason where they are spending yet another 300 million on a research site that was originally the Health care research center. Haven't had a new category in 20 years but hey What a parking lot !!!!"
"Nelson bought about 37 million P&G shares in 2016-17, around $84 per share. He has been selling lately. Also the management team are also selling P&G after it went over $130 per share. Thus, many investors are so hesitating to step in to buy when these key people are unloading in a big way. I still recalled P&G stayed in a trading range $55-70 for many years. Now a new range $95 - 145."
MCD stock price going up 100% for sales down 4 years in a row..I think PG is too cheap.
Expect a higher demand for Pampers in nine months.
This stock needs to be above $145 with great results each qtr and the dividend payouts not sure why it isn't above $145 and in the range of $150 to $170.
"Huge companies like PG move up, but slowly. Like turning an aircraft carrier around. PG, along with MMM and JNJ, have some of the most recognizable brands in existence, which dominate shelf space. Patience, however, is the byword."
come on $80
doesn't it cost a lot of money to split? I don't see why they would do this. I'm okay with this price point and continue to add shares.
"Long-term P&G holder here. Holding shares in a dividend reinvestment plan at Computershare.This stock had been a laggard for years. The dividend and SJM spinoff(since sold off) helped.Seems like management is on their heels, not their toes.Millennials and fickle consumers seem to confound P&G marketing.The days of "" soap opera "" homemakers buying armfuls of Tide and Dawn are long gone.My basis is so low (in the 20s) I'm a Zombie Long. Wishing that long-suffering longs see $100 prints soon. DJIA hitting highs, come on Procter!"
PG is one of my retirement fund. So happy with the dividend increase!
P&G debuts shampoo bottles made from beach plastic. Fantastic P&G. https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2019/03/14/p-g-debuts-shampoo-bottles-made-from-beach-plastic.html
"Amazing company, just unbelievable how people can sell this stock, why do traders buy this one?$PG is a buy, hold and accumulate stock for decades to come"
"For those that care about technicals, PG is oversold at 30 RSI which is generally where I look for opportunity. If you are looking to add to your position, this would not be a bad price. May go a tad lower over the next day but would expect it back around $135 by the end of next week."
This commercial is so insulting. Who in their right mind hired the advertising company who produced this commercial and who within P&G approved it for release?
Political opinions have a price. Not sticking around to pay it!
"Proctor and gamble is great but at 300bln + market cap is there really much upside potential left in the next couple years? I guess you could say it could be 400 or 450 bln but I'm guessing it could be a long time before this stock doubles or triples again. I mean, right ?"

"Man this stock is already down over 7 percent this year and with the Dow up close to 500 points today this stock falls 18cents, what horrible performance."
"In the short-term, the worse the news for the general market, the better it is for P&G. The flight to quality is amplified by the perception that P&G is undervalued vs it's peers. Of course this is predicated on continued good news each quarter."
Where is all the people who thought P&G was going broke because they were boycotting Gillette. The stock is going straight up.
This is exactly the market where high quality stocks like PG thrives... No frills.... Just see this going GREEN and GREEN as the market goes RED and RED....Love this
"pg reasonable price should $175 per share,because it's earnings can keeps continue growth ,"
52 week high sellers are here.
"First Starbucks, then Nike, now Gillette. A short basket is emerging."
"For those worrying about recent drops, rest assured these are only temporary.. Hedge funds love PG long term."
"Just read Nelson Peltz sold 2.148,127 shares over the last 3 days of October on behalf of his hedge fund worth nearly 267 million. Trian fund still owns about 32 million shares representing about 1.3% of P&G,s outstanding shares.Article states ""In addition, more than 2.09 million shares were disposed of by Peltz on Oct. 31 via a transfer to certain limited partners in connection with a lock-up period at a price of $124.51 """
Dividend increased 4% to 0 .7172 just announced
Any chance P&G can get into the recycle of packaging of prescription medication. The little pill bottles are very difficult to recycle.
This constant new 52 week lows stuff is getting old.
"PG was performing really well before Covid... at about $125 per share. Then in shot up like a rocket due to the hoarding and shortages of supplies and huge demand. Now, if the overall economy goes back to pre-Covid normal, this means that the companies whose stock prices were depressed due to pandemic will raise closer to their pre-pandemic levels. Guess what will happen to the companies whose price was lifted by pandemic ? Now, I don't think PG will fall all the way down to $12x, but somewhere between that and the high of $145 is, to me, pretty likely. What is there to keep the price above $140 once the Covid-driven crazy buying stops and the patterns return back to normal ?"
why does pg sell off at the close everyday9
very good price to buy at IF you’re in it for the long term.
P&G beat on earnings and reached expected Revenue numbers. Stock is down in Pre-market trading. This makes no sense!!
"What happened to all the historical data? Just when we need it, after google finance disappears, now yahoo data is gone too?"
"Things are getting interesting; it is being reported that Trian, in a recount, has succeeded (by 43K votes) in getting a PG board seat."
"PG is a solid investment! Go PG, go!"
This is P&G!
Bonuses? How on earth do managers get bonuses for the company's terrible performance? Obviously stock appreciation which is based on sales instead of some fictious parameter is not considered.
"Remember, NO PAIN NO GAIN.I'm down about 6%, starting buying more aggressively lately. I'm adding and holding.PG will prevail."
"I am long PG and have held it since it was 85 dollars. PG raised growth guidance, finished a nice year, big buyback in store. What is causing this one to fall?"
"Split or no, I'm in for the long haul. Loving the dividends allowing for travel on their money."
Procter & Gamble reached an all time high at 137.33
November will be a green month!
A vaccine for covid is a win for P&G along with the rest of the world. Buy on the dip and a little patience should pay off nicely.
Prediction ONLY! Friday: PG will beat earnings report for 4th/Q. EPS = $1.13 for the 4th. Expected is $1.09. Anyone else want a stab at this?
Love me some P&G. Great great stock will hold for a very very very long time.
"So now that Moeller has replaced Taylor as CEo, will he dump Gillette ?"
100 shares just picked up. Take advantage when the market gives free opportunity to make money.
I asked my financial adviser to sell all PG shares. I will never own or buy anything produced by them.
The weaker dollar will definitely help overseas sales and the north American sales should be outstanding. Hope for a great announcement tomorrow A.M. and hope that Moller and Taylor don't talk the stock down. Good luck to longs.
"Hasn't PG beaten analysts' estimates for the last 11 consecutive quarters?If there is a correction, won't money flow into consumer staples for some degree of safety?Shouldn't PG increase EPS by 7%+ for the next few years?"
"There is an article out saying Costco just started selling their own brand of razors and blades at a 24% discount to Gillette. Also states that Harrys is going to be selling in 2200 Walmart stores the end of this month. P&G share of the razor business has slipped to around 56% from near 70% of the market when they purchased Gillette. Lets hope the BOD finally recognizes the company has so badly managed this brand they need to sell it off as they have made so many mistakes with Gillette it is beyond repairing customers desire to buy this brand, very sad."
Keep shorting.
"This stock has given me nice capital gains as well as a decent income stream. While not a hyper growth stock it is very safe, and PG has their fingers in everybody's pies with their huge arsenal of products. Overall I believe more returns lie ahead for patient investors."
"Two reasons to hold off from profit taking. The first is that the potential upside in the next year seems high. Also, in the event of a market wide down turn you have upside in the flight to quality. There are never guarantees just probabilities."
"Roles out a commercial about morality of men then proceeds to continue to use child labor in foreign countries. ""Woke"" companies are riddled with contradictions."
PG has always been one of my recession stocks. It's looking like something is a brewing! Buckle up people!
Just used a Schick razor yesterday. First time in probably decades I've used a non-Gillette razor. It was great!
The PG add is the brain child of Marketing Director Pankaj Bhalia. Just read about him on LinkedIN. PG is going to learn a hard lesson in Marketing 101. Never introduce politics in an Ad about consumer products. Negative reaction to the AD according to Forbes is running very high. Should be see how it impacts the stock and Gillette sales. I threw away my Gillette razor two years ago. Quality isn't there and razors and blades are way to expensive.
My dad worked for this company he was 1 of 3 that didn’t have an ivory league college degree he was in sales. He has this 40000 shares and loved this stock. Retired at 52 we great company to work for they take care of there employees.
Nice increase!!! 10% beautiful!!!
"I have worked at P & G for almost 22 years and believe me, quality of product is very important.Perhaps there was an unforeseen issue with the formula that developed on the shelf. Please call the 1-800 number and they will do the appropriate follow ups to make this right."
"So profit will decline because of a rise in commodity prices.... these prices rise for everyone, are we acting like pricing at the stores never go up? I guess I should be able to buy dish soap for a nickel then. If PG’s raw material costs go up everyone’s does, they may have more leverage to keep them lower."
"I gave my grandson 1share of stock 45 years ago,,question What is the redeeming price?"
"I've rarely seen a message board more obsessed with stock splits than this one. Back in the day, when stocks usually had 100 lot minimums, that made sense for companies to split their stocks, but today, there is no rational justification for splitting a stock, which is why they are so rare. Apple and Tesla split just to attract a wider range of novice, clueless investors that get excited when they can purchase more shares. On the other hand, most long-term, seasoned investors that own P&G are in it for the slow steady growth, and ever increasing dividends. It's that simple."
Loved the support in the $131.60 range. I believe that was the bottom even if it trades lower tomorrow ex-dividend.
PG trying to act cool.I can be cool too!No longer buying any of their products.
PG seems to shine during down markets.
Old guy here who’s seen it all. . It’s sad that most of the posts here are from Millennial Robinhood kids. The market is not a video game.
"Watched the commercial a number of times. The number of underlying messages intended or otherwise is extremely insulting to put every male into one bucket, imagine doing that to women - how wrong that would be. Looked around the house at the number of P&G products, made a list of what we won't be buying from P&G anymore. The Director of Marketing and the ad agency should be fired. Understand the woman that made the ad is an extreme feminist and has done similar type ads before. The CEO is running a company, internally he needs strong HR policies but to use the company as a political weapon is extremely wrong and shareholders should be very displeased with him for the potential damage he has allowed to happen to the P&G brands."
This is the only stock on the market that isn't going anywhere for the next 100+ years. It's the *ONLY* stock that is a generational wealth builder.
Zero stock pumpers on this message board.Sure sign the company is doing the right things.
Strip out one time items and Core Earning where up 18% add to that an increase of improving cash figure now has management expecting to return about $18 billion to shareholders this year through dividends and stock buybacks.
Can’t imagine why anyone would short sell PG...with over 30 million unemployed and growing. In addition to strong demand for consumer staples...PG is a solid LT investment. Shorts would be better off trading cruise lines
$AAPL ain’t done yet. Money printer right there. Every year they will be on the cutting edge of consumables. The $PG of our time.

What a gift. Pull back before earnings. Added another 100 shares.Sold a lot of BYND and bought PG.
Total manipulation by shorties... They should first investigate these and correct this system before WallStreetBets... That was an after effect of the fraudulent activities of shorties and hedge funds... How in the world can this be negative when the Market is UPPPP.... and such a high quality stock... They know that the sane people will not sell this stock... Extremely easy to manipulate... Regulators should definitely step in....
Looking for P&G to announce dividend increase next week.
"Share price not an obvious logical reaction to the news, looks a bit like short selling to push down price before accumulation in anticipation of higher price in next few days or weeks. Bottom line: hold or buy."
When do they announce dividend? Going by history it would go ex-div next week.
"Easy money here, gonna be a big green day tomorrow"
"P&G has 5 divisions. Only 2 are valuable in terms of profit margin: Beauty (19% of Sales / 23% of Earnings) and Grooming (10% of sales / 14% of earnings). Therefore if you really want to hurt P&G (i.e. get woke / go broke), these are the products to boycott: Beauty (Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice, Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II), Grooming (Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus). Of course there are more products in the other three areas to get to also, but concentrating efforts on their most profitable products is the best bang for your buck, pun intended.For more information, visit https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/80424/000008042418000055/fy171810-kreport.htm"
Odd day for PG. Dow is up 4% yet PG is down.?I guess Wall Street expects people to stop buying shampoo and Toilet paper.It was getting a bit rich even with monster sales figures. This could be a healthy pullback.Definitely not a trend
"Money is flowing out of consumer staples and into chips, banks, and oil.PG is a slow grower in comparison.You get more safety and an OK dividend with OG.Good for retirees over 70."
Nice little pull back before earnings and ex div. date! Love it
Fantastic numbers. P&G is in beast-mode in times like these. Very happy to hold shares in this amazing dividend king.
Stock Invest states P&G stock has a 90% probability of holding a price between $156.15 and $166.39 at the end of the next 3 months.
Why change CEO from David Taylor to Moeller now? After only 6 years? Seems a bit early to be changing CEO.
"Owned PG before and sold it making a profit, but always liked the products it sells. Every household uses PG products and their dividend history is outstanding, so yesterday was a good entry point for me and now I am a shareholder again."
"Done: 10% boost..8698/share....why not .87/share? With 2.46B shares outstanding, the additional .0002 per share equals an added div expense of $492,000 (or did I slip a decimal?)"
A split is usually done to make share price more affordable for the little guy.
"Very surprised PG isn't up more after the great earnings report. After a few upgrades over the weekend, maybe close to a new 52 week high next week. Great long term investment!"
I bought 400 shares at $126 during the pullback a few weeks ago. Sold today for 136.80. PG is a great company. Decided to sell as I’m pretty overweight in my portfolio with consumer staples stocks. Go PG!!
"I have held this stock for 20 years. Although the growth of capital would have been faster in tech companies, I am happy with the dividends."
Went all in PG. I want and need high reliable dividends coming in when the Fed finally decides to increase interest rates.
On to 150!
Should bid back up soon. They are in a great space for Covid product buying into 2021
Dividend raised to $0.7907https://www.pginvestor.com/file/Index?KeyFile=403608237
Nice!!! PG is a great long term investment!!!
"@X77-999-3 Yes, and the next three quarters, iincluding the upcoming, will be 0.8698 per share. Go to Historical tab, select dividend.Owner since July 1991. +10.14% per year total annual average return."
Short it. Short it for 5 shares or 500. Short it and get paid for the worst marketing mistake in the history of advertising.
86 after earnings!
Deutsche presentation tomorrow could shed some light on year end numbers. Lets hope Moller has some good news to share.
"My dad and I threw away our razors today. I've been buying over priced razors from Gillette for over 20 years. Today, I switched to Harrys. #boyswillbeboys"
"Expecting P&G to have an excellent quarter and lower year end numbers next Thursday, If P&G follows KMB could get a nice pop on the stock price . North American sales should be exceptional and sales in China, P&G,s second largest market may well be muted due to covid-19. Hope the hedge fund folks will let the stock alone for a while but since these guys aren't really long term investors, will probably start dumping if the shares hit 130+ best of luck to longs ."
I would love to see an accounting of the proceeds from all of the brand sales. Then have Management and the BOD explain how selling off all of these brands
86 after earnings
"Many years ago I got rid of my Capital One card because Alec Baldwin is/was a POS. I doubt they noticed because I was broke back then. Now I spend 150 K a year on my personal AMEX card and God knows how much business my company transacts via non Capital One cards. United screwed me ten years ago when I was flying back from burying my dad down in NZ. I told them I would never fly again with them or any affiliate and nor would any of my employees on business. Last year my employees had over 600 flights and 90 % of those were on Delta. Now when I head back down there it is Delato to Hawaii and Hawaiian Airlines to NZ. Inconvenient? Yep. When I couldn't stomach ESPN any more I got rid of my sports package and went completely online for my baseball/football fix. When HBO went completely leftward I got rid of all my premium channels, not just HBO, and now just subscribe again during GOT seasons. When Netflix hired Susan Rice I canceled within an hour of the announcement. Two hours ago I was speaking with the other co-founder and the upshot is we told the facilities people that they needed to replace all Dawn, Charmin and Bounty on our campuses. I have a beard and just go to a barber when I need trimming etc. so I doubt I have used a Gillette product in my 25 years in the US but I don't care. Hollywood is about to go #$%$ up because it is a leftist echo chamber. Nike got smoked with its woke garbage and P&G in another couple of quarters will be trading in the low 60's. Actions have consequences."
good stock. Need to drop to 110 to be fair.
"I have an acquaintance whose father started working for P&G when he graduated from high school; he stayed with them until he retired at age 65. Never got into management, just a good steady worker in the plant. BUT when he retired, he had over $1M in his retirement plan with them; he never took the dividends--just kept reinvesting for 4+ decades. His daughter, with a college degree, and grad school, had a professional job. Did her retirement picture look far better than his? Nope! She had far less than her father. That says a lot for P&G!"
"PG is reaching oversold territory (RSI at 31) ... added a position last week, added 100 shares today and have the ammunition to add more should it go lower.I see PG as a long-time hold"

"Clorox warning ️ this am and falling big premarket will likely negatively affect pg.,,,"
10 billions share buyback and 8 billions for dividend
"All I can say is I work for P&G in one of their plants. I’ve never seen it this busy in 15 years. Every line is staffing up, and they are predicting growth for the next 5 years. Covid has changed everything."
"Things for shareholders to ponder. Management paid around 57 billion for Gilletet, sold off Duracell for about 4.7 billion after sinking 1.4 billion in cash in the deal, so the net is about 54 billion for Gillete including Oral B and Braun, and has lost market share in grooming in dramatic fashion. Spends roughly a billion on Olestra and builds an entire plant only to shuttle it all and made zero. Sells over 100 brands and again share holder get the same thing as from the Duracell sale, zero. In 2016 Taylors raise exceeds 130% and gets a bonus of 2.5 million, share holders get a 1% dividend increase. 2017 Taylors raise is 25% and dividend increase is 3%. Company spend lord only knows how many millions to keep Peltz off the board, then installs him anyway. Spends 300+million on Mason research center and has no new brand since Swiffer. BOD appoints the CEO job to the president of Grooming division which is the worst performing division within the company. Wonder why the stock is performing so badly with the company running so smoothly."
Added another position @ 134.70 on Friday. Everything below 135 is no-brainer - long-term hold ...
Is 123$ good to invest for a year expecting 138$ at the end of the period?
Is PG ever going to split again?
I don't see any report of their guidance for 2019 on the report. Any info on this?
"If there is one thing about PG I like best it is their consistency. Consistent dividend payout raises, slow but steady increase in the share price, easy company to understand both financially and in terms of their business, etc. It may not always outperform the S&P, but you can count on this company being around 100 years from now for certain."
Procter & Gamble reached an all time high at 141.09
Magicpowo copied P and G's magic eraser and sells 100 for $25.00 on Amazon compared to PG's price of $ 6.97 for 9 sponges. Same ingredients and works great. Does AMZN copy products and sell under their own off brand label? I have seen this several times on AMZN with the exact same ingredients. Kind of like COSTCO selling their own Grey Goose Vodka beating their price by $10.00. Both are made in France and I read on a COSTCO site that it is made at the same plant.
"got in at $127. It's already in some of my ETF and other funds, but I like having a bit more long term here."
After a strong quartet PG is down for the third day in a row. I guess people selling safe stocks like PG and moving to more cyclical names. I am still surprised that people are dumping PG the day before it goes ex dividend approximately $4.50 from the recent highs since the EPS report. Hard to believe people are so short sides but I guess KMB forecast not helping but below $119? I would not be selling PG after 3 days down the day before it goes ex dividend. It seems odd to me.
"Goldman Sachs raised their target on P&G to $150 yesterday and Deutsche Bank raised to $150 also today , Argus price is $155, etc. Earnings on the 20th. will be exceptional."
Procter & Gamble reached an all time high at 143.35
"Ok so this is such a huge problem that P&G needs to address it, they just can't help themselves but take the moral high ground. Will they be addressing the federal deficit? war? the opioid crisis? anything else? anything?"
"Obviously with a vaccine no one is going to do laundry, wash dishes, and use paper products ever again! What a joke today’s sell off is."
"I'm not seeing P&G do much in the way of advancing social problem. If you don't think that's an issue, you're part of the problem."
"Another fantastic Q from our hard-working people at P&G!All I need to know is this;""P&G expects to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends in fiscal 2021. The Company increased its outlook for common stock repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion in fiscal 2021. Combined, P&G now plans to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners in this fiscal year.""Thumbs up, P&P, thumbs up!!"
