"Procter & Gamble (ticker: PG) is up 10.8% in 2020, while the Dow has gained 6.3%.Although P&G began the year with an earnings miss, it has delivered three strong reports since. The shares didn’t react much in April, as demand for cleaning products was hampered by concerns about a strong dollar and the uncertain outlook at the start of the pandemic.Yet the company has been raising its dividend while continuing share repurchases, and its July results showed that even economic uncertainty couldn’t dampen sales of its portfolio of premium cleaning products. The company turned in another strong quarter in October, as organic sales continued to shine.Naturally, 2021 will present a challenge for P&G, as the receding threat of the virus will take some focus off cleaning. Yet others argue that the standard for cleaning will permanently be higher post-pandemic, to the benefit of P&G and peers. In addition, P&G has historically had one of the higher organic growth rates in the staples industry. Those metrics will certainly fall a bit in 2021, but if it can continue to show that it’s resonating with consumers, the shares need not fade with Covid.Analysts seem fairly bullish about P&G. Of the 24 analysts tracked by FactSet, 62% have a Buy rating or the equivalent, while a third are Hold-rated and there is one bearish call. The average analyst price target is $153.05"
"I find it funny but not surprising at all the comments regarding the slight drop in P&G today. If there was any stock to ignore the short-term moves it would be P&G. Most shareholders of P&G don't worry about the daily, monthly, or even yearly moves of the stock. Our holding period is measured in decades."
"I gave my grandson 1share of stock 45 years ago,,question What is the redeeming price?"
PG to crush earnings tomorrow.
Strip out one time items and Core Earning where up 18% add to that an increase of improving cash figure now has management expecting to return about $18 billion to shareholders this year through dividends and stock buybacks.
When do they announce dividend? Going by history it would go ex-div next week.
Any chance P&G can get into the recycle of packaging of prescription medication. The little pill bottles are very difficult to recycle.
"I'm not seeing P&G do much in the way of advancing social problem. If you don't think that's an issue, you're part of the problem."
Solid as a rock.
Spend $100 on P&G products at Costco and get a $25 cash card (limit 2).
"I am happy with any earnings report with marketshare growth even if revenue temporary declines. It shows that it is better than its competitors. With the business that PG is in which is mainly self, beauty and home care the markets in developing countries have very minimal growth rates. That is why PG needs increased market share because the market isn't growing very quickly."
I plan on selling my share of Shopify and taking 10+ shares of PG. Slow and steady wins the race.
Sold all shares today. Didn't realize this company deals in politics.
"Pretty decent earnings,PG remains a very safe dividend stock. Of course it falls in a minor beat, happens almost every time for all stocks lol. I might buy more depending on how much it drops."
Magicpowo copied P and G's magic eraser and sells 100 for $25.00 on Amazon compared to PG's price of $ 6.97 for 9 sponges. Same ingredients and works great. Does AMZN copy products and sell under their own off brand label? I have seen this several times on AMZN with the exact same ingredients. Kind of like COSTCO selling their own Grey Goose Vodka beating their price by $10.00. Both are made in France and I read on a COSTCO site that it is made at the same plant.
PG revenue declining last 4 quarters. They need to make some changes.
"Another fantastic Q from our hard-working people at P&G!All I need to know is this;""P&G expects to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends in fiscal 2021. The Company increased its outlook for common stock repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion in fiscal 2021. Combined, P&G now plans to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners in this fiscal year.""Thumbs up, P&P, thumbs up!!"
broke through the 142 resistance now it's on to 150s
Is PG ever going to split again?
"Higher cost, lower margin. Insiders’ sell-off since Friday!"
"PG is a buy on the dip, despite inflationary pressures the consumer will not cut back their needed staples due to passed on price increases dictated by inflation. Profit margins are very likely to stay intact. PG is a core holding for any investor, young or old."
great
Went all in PG. I want and need high reliable dividends coming in when the Fed finally decides to increase interest rates.
why does pg sell off at the close everyday9
JM knows how to drive this up
gonna load up. have $138 limit order in for 10 shares !! want to double my holding in this workhorse of a stock.
PG looking into buying CLX? Has anyone else heard about this possibility or is it just made up?
This won't stay below 140$ for long... :D
"During the greatest stock market bull run in history, and during the greatest modern-day pandemic, and you are a CLEANING PRODUCTS COMPANY, and from exactly one year ago till today, your stock price has risen EXACTLY ONE DOLLAR AND EIGHTY ONE CENTS, I wonder how the dorks running this company haven't had their bleeping bleeps kicked out in the middle of the street by now is an American tragedy. Throw the bums out!"
"Very good earnings on top and bottom line, forecasts growth in a difficult market. Strong and steady, why would you sell at 104? Be my guest, you can right now, not me, there is more upside than down side for PG"
"Revenue beats, EPS beats by 2 cents at 1.61."
I'm seeing incredible Inflation. Are you? It's real like really in my view.
"I do not see PG going much higher; maybe $150. And January 3rd a possible down trend driven by energy??The last spit was 06/21/04 when the price was listed at $46.43 (using Yahoo's stats, so it could have been $92.86)So, $70 per share would be a nice price to increase holdings in these days of inflated stock prices; and nice to double my shares and more after January 3rd.This company has assisted in putting one daughter through private college and will do the same for a grand daughter. My bullish feeling is largely generated by it's value today and it's past history of operations."
Rough week for PG
"PG is a solid investment! Go PG, go!"
Zero stock pumpers on this message board.Sure sign the company is doing the right things.
$INTC $PG$CLX Value play lol?

"Markets explode upwards today, P&G falls! What else is new? How do the bums running this company keep their jobs? I make more money on my checking account."
