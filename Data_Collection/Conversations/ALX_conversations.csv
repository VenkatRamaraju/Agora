I think this is the most interesting office REIT out there. Certainly something for your watchlist. The valuation is so much more compelling compared to say Vornado or SL. Not to mention the superior yield.

"HRTX heron and denali dnli look ok to me. Take a look at flu spec nbrvKaruna and Corona and (blank) virus all sound the same. krtx way way overbought because of it.....my thoeory is this has led to strange buying , unnecessary buying of this particular ticker.I think spec flu plays have a place in your portfolio and the market such as NBRV and a few others. This stock has zero to do with the flu that is still killing aggressively, and thus getting worse.ingapore health authorities tipped Malaysia off that the family had entered the country. The three are in stable condition with symptoms of a cough, and have been isolated, the health minister said. Five others who were traveling with them have tested negative for the virus.Wuhan doctor reported dead (10:20 a.m.)A doctor in Wuhan has died from the virus, local media reported. It’s not clear if the 62-year-old specialist was working on the front lines to treat the illness, with some saying he had retired.Calls for investigation on Wuhan residents (9:45 a.m. HKT)Curbing the virus from spreading out from Wuhan is the political responsibility of Hubei, Jiang Chaoliang, the party secretary of the province, said in a meeting this Friday.For new cases outside the province involving people that have been to Wuhan city, investigations should be launched on how they got out, Jiang was reported as saying .Australian infection (9:05 a.m. HKT)Australia reported its first confirmed case of the coronavirus following the infection of a Wuhan man who flew into Melbourne on Jan. 19. The patient, a visitor in his 50s, has pneumonia and is in a stable condition, authorities said.Australia has raised the level of travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei Province to “Level 4 -- do not travel.”Chinese military doctors (9 a.m. HKT)Military doctors from the People’s Liberation Army arrived in Wuhan to respond to the coronavirus problem, according to Radio Television Hong Kong.China Death Count, Cases Rise (8:07 a.m. HKT)At least 41 people have died and an additional 444 infections have been confirmed across 29 Chinese provinces, authorities said in a statement, a dramatic increase in the toll from the outbreak of coronavirus centered on the city of Wuhan.The number of confirmed cases has climbed to 1,287 including 237 severe cases, the government said.Chinese authorities have locked down public travel in Wuhan and several surrounding areas in an effort to contain the infection’s spread. Health officials around the globe have been expecting more cases and deaths, though the dramatic increase in the tally may raise fears that the outbreak is worse than initially thought.‘Doomsday’ scenes in Wuhan (7 a.m. HKT)Health centers in Wuhan are struggling to meet demand from hundreds of unwell people, with many turned away from hospitals crammed with patients lying in packed corridors, the South China Morning Post reports.Wuhan deaths (5:01 a.m. HKT)Hubei provincial authorities release case reports of 15 people who died recently in the province. The deceased patients were ages 55 to 87 years and many had underlying chronic disease, such as high blood pressure and type-2 diabetes.Of the 14 for whom gender was noted, four were females. One case, a 76-year-old woman who died on Friday, developed a persistent fever 13 days after she was admitted to Wuhan’s Third Hospital with a broken arm. Her symptoms progressed to bilateral pneumonia and shortness of breath. She slipped into a coma and died of respiratory failure days later.Nepal Reports First Confirmed Case (Saturday, 12:07 a.m. HKT)A 31-year-old student in Nepal tested positive for the virus after returning from Wuhan where he is doing his PhD, the Kathmandu Post reported, becoming South Asia’s first confirmed case.He was discharged from hospital after his health improved but an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said they are trying to track down the man after a lab result came back positive for the virus.latest of yhoo in two parts. I still like ELOX, FPRX PTLA IRWD TEVA, the three other stocks that trade creepily related, similar, or run by the same power bank or team I plan on selling.... This next week might as well be called teva week. I'm looking for more volatility in the name then the entire last 2 months have seen. Minimum 1.5 gain, max up 2.5 dollars gained by friday.I am happy to wait on nbrv and add every few days. When peothple, bashers, those waiting on ach deposits have nothing they can really point out to bash a stock with options and over a 100 million market cap and at least 50 million liquid cash net worth for a tight company out of Dublin, (some of the sharpest scientists going)... yeah just stick with might go bankrupt on your posts and have another shot on me.Nabriva is the real deal, Aleksandr is the real spelling."
