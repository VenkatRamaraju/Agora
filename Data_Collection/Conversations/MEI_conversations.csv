"Guidance. The company has recognized that it's previously projections for EBITA of 200 million by 2020 is challenged. This has led Methode to now announce unspecified future internal cost reduction plans across the company and it's recent new acquisitions. Automotive contract cost concessions together with production delays by customers has led to an emphasis on the non-auto business re:Hetronic, Power Solutions group, and Dabir. Most significant for the 2020 past projections is the Dabir Surfaces medical initiative. Dabir has been slower to develop than expected. However, if Methode can crack this new industry, the potential is huge. The market may be questioning the visibility of this non-automotive growth. The next year will likely tell the tale. I'm long.. looking for Dabir to pan out."

"Resilience in the face many headwinds. I applaud management's ability to navigate the covid era turbulence. Between cost cutting measures, major product line shifts to meet demand and future sales/ contract bookings, all while increasing y/y financial metrics, they deserve a little credit. I also applaud their kitchen sink approach with regard to guidance-- under promise and overdeliver. While I expect their first fiscal quarter to show the full effect of the Covid shutdown, I do expect the operations to gradually return to normal. In fact, in the Q&A portion of their Conference call, they hinted that sales are already on a path to normalization, which means the worst is behind them. Considering the upward trajectory of the business, synergies yet to be fully realized, growth prospects in their medical device and current valuation relative to both industry peers and the S&P500, I recommend owning the shares and consider any weakness a great buying opportunity."

This company is a complete dog. The CEO is horrible. Just listen to one of their calls he sounds like he just came off a weekend of drinking. GOOD PRODUCTS however the leadership here is horrible. The incompetent CEO makes well over $1M while the stock is hovering around a 5 year low

MEI... It could either mean that the stock is in a lasting downtrend or just oversold and therefore bound to retrace .Me thinks MEI is over sold.
