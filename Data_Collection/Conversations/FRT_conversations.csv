FRT owns grocery store anchored strip malls in very well to do areas... Their cash flow is solid. I lost on SPG with retail but I don't forsee FRT having the same issues that non grocery store anchored outlet malls or malls in general. I also own BRX in this sector
Easy buy!

assets could be a good protection against inflation. FRT owns good assets in good locations and pays good dividend
Does anyone know what the dividend is and when it pays out? There is no thing on the historical data or the summary.

"a rather brutal day on no news ... what gives? Just rotation out of retail? If that's all I stay long and maybe buy more, because the CEO says that all the space that goes empty, gets filled for higher rents. And, if things really do get prosperous for average Americans, it will be good for retail."
"Shares of Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT rallied 2.29% in the past two days after the retail REIT announced acquisition of four properties. The acquisitions are a strategic fit for the company, given the scope for value creation through redevelopment, merchandising and capital investment.Particularly, Federal Realty has acquired Grossmont Shopping Center in greater San Diego, CA and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, VA. Further, in the Phoenix Metro area, AZ, the company has entered into a binding contract to buy Camelback Colonnade and Hilton Village. Notably, the assets under binding contract are expected to close by June end. Federal Realty will own an average 80% stake in the four assets, which totals 1.75 million square feet on 125 acres of land, at a gross value of $407 million."
