"FRT is rapidly climbing back up to pre-Covid levels. This stock is benefitting from a return to ""Back to normal"", plus people's concerns about inflation. FRT, as well as XRX, JETS, MAR, CCL, NCLH, SABR, KBWY, NHI, PRU, SAFT, and CNK will likely reach their pre-Covid level and keep going strong."

"I see $40 for the share price on this one. Sell !All the best, Brad"
assets could be a good protection against inflation. FRT owns good assets in good locations and pays good dividend
good dividens 
Easy buy!
Does anyone know what the dividend is and when it pays out? There is no thing on the historical data or the summary.

FRT owns grocery store anchored strip malls in very well to do areas... Their cash flow is solid. I lost on SPG with retail but I don't forsee FRT having the same issues that non grocery store anchored outlet malls or malls in general. I also own BRX in this sector

Quality asset. Thought i would comment because very few do on this site.
have we seen the peak for FRT?
I would take $SPG and $FRT over $O right now.
looking forward to my divided payment. It's about the only reason I'm holding my shares with Fed real.
9% why?!
"Shares of Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT rallied 2.29% in the past two days after the retail REIT announced acquisition of four properties. The acquisitions are a strategic fit for the company, given the scope for value creation through redevelopment, merchandising and capital investment.Particularly, Federal Realty has acquired Grossmont Shopping Center in greater San Diego, CA and Chesterbrook Shopping Center in McLean, VA. Further, in the Phoenix Metro area, AZ, the company has entered into a binding contract to buy Camelback Colonnade and Hilton Village. Notably, the assets under binding contract are expected to close by June end. Federal Realty will own an average 80% stake in the four assets, which totals 1.75 million square feet on 125 acres of land, at a gross value of $407 million."
