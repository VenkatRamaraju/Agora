"Inspite of continuing supply chain problems, resulting lower housing output numbrers, the house prices have moved up 4 times in a row now.My understanding is that eventually some existing builders will go up,(Most efficiant ones) some will go down, & alterntive housing like preefabricated ones will play a grater role in augmenting supplies in the future."
"Amazing content from a technical standpoint, the biggest challenge investor face can range from controlling the impulsiveness to the frailty of compulsion. Most newbies and investor often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broad market. In essence, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past createa sustainable pattern that can be used to predict the future movement of the asset. It takes a lot of time to do this. Why do I find expert opinion in retail,has always been a guide to me and I've enjoyed the signaling service of some with some losses until I've started copying trade notifications from Mr Bambi Alex to trades in these past 6 weeks and I've seen differences in my portfolio. I started with 3 B T C and I have accumulated over 9 B T C ::He is an expert trader with a high quality trading accuracy,she can be reached on her Facebook (Bambi Alex) or contact her on WhatsApp number ***+1 3 0 4 8 0 5 6 3 0 2 for profitable trading.."
holding my puts through the melt up of the next 2 to 4 months to enjoy the plunge
"Most people that own this stock are long but you may want to consider buying DRV, it shorts the housing market. Once people can start evicting renters again banks will begin foreclosures followed by the fed raising interest rates. Everyone who has ARM loans will see their payments go to levels they cannot afford. We haven’t seen a bubble like this since 2008 and there is a lot of money to be made on the way down just like it was made on the way up. Research DRV and you will see earnings potential. As WARREN buffet said be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful!"
"It is about to erase half the gains for the year, enjoy…"
Hopefuly DHI might turn the tables.How it will harness the solid demand for housing to its advantage on the ground inspite of current difficulties will be the key for shareprices to regain.
Down today more than market. Drop in commodity prices should be a plus.
Going to sink like a rock ! Love it !

"This is an undervalued stock that just had a killer quarter and expects to double its home sales for 2021. When compared to competitors including Lennar and Toll Brothers, D.R. Horton wins in the most inside buys over the last six months, best P/E ratio, best debt/equity ratio, highest return on equity and operating margin, and highest expected 5-year growth rate (18%). Also, DHI's PEG ratio is less than one, which means its growth rate is higher than its P/E ratio, a favorite metric that investing genius Peter Lynch from Fidelity uses."
"DHI is building less homes due to labor/material shortages, but their margins have improved due to higher prices, and their EPS looks to remain the same. That's a huge positive not a negative, as the other homes are just in backlog with the national shortage of housing, they'll add to EPS. DHI needs to be exhausting their share repurchase here, further driving EPS."
Excited for the arrival of the high $90's very soon.
