AOSL reached a new 52 Week Low at $10.88
"Investors are starting to get the message, AOSL is in a sweet spot with its power products. Demand is much higher than supply and this is across all suppliers. Pricing power is in their camp and this will be reflected when they announce their earnings. If they can show even a slight improvement, the stock price should hit mid 30’s which is still undervalued VS other semiconductor companies. I hope that the true value will be realized at some point, we should be over 40.00 when that happens."
"B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis raised the firm's price target on Alpha & Omega to $52 from $48 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the ""strong beat and raise"" quarter."
"Zacks basis it’s ratings on revised earnings expectations, I guess analysts are not expecting that AOSL will beat the earnings forecast. I guess we wait and see."
"LastQ the stock was in the strong 30's and now under 30 with such growth who knows what those that shorted will do, I will be adding more for the long term as this could very well move as AMD did."
Riley raised price target from 48 to 52 today. Great conference call. EPS estimate raised to 2.74 for 2021 (see Barrons; Yahoo lagging in updates). So aosl trades at pe =10.66! Yet growing like weed!
"MOSFETs business is trading at very thin margin and if they have back end and or front end operations in China, watch for those tariff related cost to eat into its margin more. In the same line of thinking, current environment should favor companies have most their productions in US or non China zone. INTC, TXN, ADI (has its own fab in US), AMD, NVDA (use TSMC in Taiwan) etc."
"The market is forward looking, based on historical cycles the demand for semiconductors should be trending down by year end. This cycle is different, demand will remain strong for longer because semiconductor content is growing at a very rapid rate. Earnings will confirm this when they start to roll out. TSMC announced yesterday, they guided up for next quarter. I’m still a believer that AOSL is undervalued at these levels."
"The stock is down in literally a few thousand shares . In fact if you Look on Fintel.com or holdingschannel.com the same Firms and Hedge funds own AOSL, that we’re also behind the moves in Semi- peers CRUS, IPHI, UCTT, ACLS, COHU. I’m fact their is an enhancement Fundy wise when comparing AOSL. We are a 50% discount to SPX PE, and just over 1X Sales. Even if we don’t get a huge ER pop out of gates, I see stock 20% higher fairly short term . In fact I bought the 11/15 & 12/15 calls @$15 strike today !!"
"It appears to be on a solid upward trend, under appreciated beginning to get some attention."
"Excellent earning report! AOSL will rock like klic, simo, acls etc"
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 26.27
Alpha & Omega is up 9.20% to 16.97
The product AOSL makes are very much in demand and will continue to grow substantially moving forward. If the stock price remains where it is they will become a buy out target. The stock price would be in the hi 40’s at the very least. I believe the stock price will start to move upwards now that the next quarter revenue is clear.
AOSL is very under-appreciated. Be patient
"Wow, great EPS. The shares are really undervalued at these levels. Let's see if the market rewards the great performance, if not someone will buy this super cheap company. The disadvantage for AOSL is that they're small and don't have great coverage. Fingers crossed for tomorrow."
Nice run for AOSL & I really appreciate the non-rabid Yahoo thread.
It's too bad this board is so slow. I'd like to hear from people that have been following this for a while.
"Semi stocks are cyclical, many analysts are predicting that the cycle is over for now which is why stocks are taking a beating. I believe that the demand will be stronger for a longer time which is why I’m adding at these levels. AOSL should be a 40.00 stock in my opinion."
I wonder which gaming console they kept talking about. Supposedly to be released in second half of 2020. I imagine the new playstation or xbox will sell like crazy this year.
"Benchmark Initiates Coverage On Alpha & Omega with Buy Rating, Announces Price Target of $55"
Alpha & Omega reached a 52 Week high at 15.29
we are not far from the low 20's range once a market broad correction occurs.
Better buying opportunity ahead. Keeping holding what you have and add more this is a long term hold
Doubled my small position today at 30.53 so now overall down 1%We'll see how it goes fo rwhen I may add more.It's the start of tax loss selling season - my favorite time to start new positions or add to old ones. So I may not have any more new money for AOSL.
"Business for AOSL has never been better, demand is exceeding supply by a large amount. They can definitely demand higher prices from non strategic customers. My bet is that they will blow away numbers again this quarter which will drive the stock higher. They're in a great spot with product that is in very high demand by the EV car makers."
AOSL reached a new 52 Week Low at $10.70
"Alpha & Omega Q4 Adj. EPS $0.95 Beats $0.76 Estimate, Sales $177.30M Beat $170.30M Estimate4:02 pm ET August 11, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintAlpha & Omega (NASDAQ:AOSL) reported quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.76 by 25 percent. This is a 227.59 percent increase over earnings of $0.29 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $177.30 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $170.30 million by 4.11 percent. This is a 44.86 percent increase over sales of $122.39 million the same period last year."
"Hi, I've just bouht AOSL for $32.50. And I hope, it will goes only up from now. Friday will be more optimistic ;)"
Alpha and Omega Semiconductor is up 6.46% to 28.99
Great earnings report and cc. It will go back to 19's or higher.
"Our trailing PE is 12, our current growth rate is 44%, we are selling at 1.8X book value AND our price to revenue is 1. This stock is being giving away and I will happily add as much as I can @ these prices."
633k short shares need to be covered. AOSL has $657M revenue in 2020 and net income $2.93 per share. AOSL is trading 1x sale and PE less than 10. It is ridiculously undervalued.
"Very disappointing valuation for AOSL, they haven’t convinced the analysts that they can manage their margin and the demand. They should buy back shares at these levels or put themselves up for sale."
"Alpha & Omega price target raised to $52 from $48 at B. Riley B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis raised the firm's price target on Alpha & Omega to $52 from $48 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the ""strong beat and raise"" quarter."
AOSL makes power products which are required in every electronic product being manufactured. This stock in under the radar and should be trading in the high 20’s to low 30’s. I believe it will see mid 30’s by March of 2021.
I'm trying to find out why this company shouldn't head back to the mid $30's? Everything looks great with growth and the PE and PEG. Am I missing anything?

Getting hammered in AH which seems to be about par for the course these days...
AOSL reached a new 52 Week Low at $9.71
"All Semies are down, not enough interest in AOSL to keep the price up. Unfortunately this might be the orice level until the next semis run which could be end of the year. Some consolidation will need to happen. This a solid company with new products and good growth potential. Patience will be needed. Undervalued at these levels."
"This thing is an a nice run after last Q. Volume increased and it does quick consolidations at the top just to jump again. It's crossed the previous high without hesitation few days ago. Didn't lose ground on china delisting either. Not many traders talking this stock up on this thread, so probably institutions are loading up quietly. I think the fair price for AOSL should be PS=2 and PE=20 for 30% growth co. in the right industry, so around 50 bucks a share."
This is a $25 stock in a year!
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 29.12
AOSL reached a new 52 Week Low at 11.66
Stock would be fairly valued at $15- now!
"Great earnings, more to come."
I am betting on it !
"so far, interesting action: green in a sea of red. Something is up?"
"AOSL is still undervalued and should break new 52 week high soon, Do not forget AOSL has own fabs. That is very advangeous because AOSL can control own price and pick high margin products during semiconductor shortage periods."
"Another TJ Roberts article on Seeking Alpha this morning. AOSL is a ""diamond in the rough"" for value investors."
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 24.19
Any thoughts here? This kind of up and down action seems to be the norm over the last several months. More of the same until some new announcement or next earnings report?
It is the turn of small cap semiconductor companies especially like undervalued AOSL. AOSL will reach new 52-week high soon.
"Alpha & Omega price target raised to $52 from $48 at B. Riley ( 05/06/21 )B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis raised the firm's price target on Alpha & Omega to $52 from $48 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the ""strong beat and raise"" quarter.Believe analysts will raise price target again after earnings."
Alpha & Omega reached a 52 Week high at 17.75
"It feels like AOSL is being manipulated, it gets slammed for no reason and then recovers. It requires more patience on our part and the fortitude not to sell. Earnings will improve again making the stock cheaper and more attractive to a potential buyer of the company. This would be a 50.00 plus dollar stock if that were to happen. This is a value stock and shareholders will be rewarded."
AOSL is down -5.08% to 14.57
We are already in the $27 range without a broad market correction. It will get challenging in the next few months.
"From Barron's: 2 analysts have split opinions: 1 buy 1 sell. EPS estimates, >$3.00; target price, one at $52, one at $26. I heard the bear just raised his price target to $27, but maintain sell rating.Go figure! One of them must be wrong."
"I'm already deep into HIMX, UMC, MU and AMAT. I want to open a position here but maybe I'm overdoing it or over-diversifying within the semiconductor sector -- but I think this one provides good upside. Which one of the above would you drop to add this, and why?"
"Wow, just found this company today while researching HIMX - another semi trading with a dirt cheap PE… Looks like I’ll be starting a position here tomorrow for an easy double over the next 12 months."
"A top rated stock by most measures and all analysts, but why the price performance vs its peers is lagging?"
AOSL reached a new 52 Week Low at 14.07
"amazing volume today, finally starting to get the attention it deserves"
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 31.90
"Where is ASOL ' s manufacturing done, please ?"
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 33.72
do you all see the fwd PE?
Bought for the first time at 30
They have Apple now... https://seekingalpha.com/article/4295726-alpha-omega-new-customers-products-revenue
"Added more this morning, happy to see the nice spike today. When the earnings start to roll out for the semi’s manufacturers, share prices will rise. My prediction is 36 to 38 dollars by the end of July."
A new 52 week high!
"Going to mid 30s at least ...

The whole sector is down today. Patience is needed for this stock because eventually it will pop into the $35-$40 range. It can’t be ignored forever.
"This Analyst Sees 82% Upside In Alpha & Omega Semiconductor - Read WhyBenchmark analyst David Williams initiated coverage of Alpha & Omega Semiconductor Ltd with a Buy and $55 price target, implying an 82.2% upside. The current robust demand environment has accelerated structural improvements. Williams believes Alpha & Omega has now reached a ""fundamental inflection point"" as it has achieved scale to support a long-term path of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue is becoming increasingly diversified, and new products are providing significant content expansion, Williams added."
Both B. Riley and Benchmark analysts gave AOSL targets above 50$. It is the turn of AOSL to run.
They are growing year by year and still not reach their limit
All it does is chug higher!
100k volume in 15 minutes this is going to fly
Alpha & Omega reached an all time high at 32.29
"I like that AOSL is buying back stock however the float is thin already and this makes it thinner which institutions DON'T like. Having said that, the word is getting out that pretty much ALL semiconductor suppliers will benefit from very high demand for MOSFET's and power semiconductors in general. The next 2 quarters are in the bag , profits will rise again which I believe will drive this stock much higher. Customers are locking in orders for all of 2022 and they're willing to pay upfront, the CEO said this on the last earnings call. This speaks volumes and also tells you that demand will be strong for some time to come. I averaged down a few weeks ago and I'm glad I did. GLTA"
I added more shares to my holding today. AOSL is trading at 1x sale and less than 10 PE. It is ridiculously cheap now.
Manipulation at its best.
Any ideas what this is about?

"It seems there is positive momentum on weekly chart. There was a short squeeze and now, it goes up! Bye, bye short sellers..."
A very likely takeover target.

Nvidia (NVDA) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) are also among the group's highest-rated stocks."
At least it finished at the high of the day. Volume was not much above average. Problem is that they guided basically flat and GM is guided lower. Not sure where the growth story is here...
"Simply Wall Street's report valuing AOSL at $14 should be deleted. Those guys are clueless. Like all analyst, they want to get in cheaply at AOSL. This stock should be in the 20s based on its consistent growth and earnings report."
nice up in a down market! AOSL is extremely undervalued now.
Is a cup and handle forming?
Why is rhino stock down so much? I thought semi conductors were in demand??
WOW....Soild Strong results
"The market is signaling a correction is imminent, AOSL will correct towards the 20 range."
Nice to see some life here again.
It is time for undervalued small cap semiconductor comply like AOSL to shine. My ACLS is on fire today.
"up 1,20 % after market lets go"
Alpha & Omega is up 10.47% to 30.38
I've been to other chat room but here I noticed a lot of yahoo comment
Alpha & Omega is up 9.27% to 12.50
AOSL is up 7.80% to 16.44
The stock does this every year as this quarter is usually their slowest do to the New Year holiday which closes them down for two weeks. I agree the stock should be in the 20s.
"We're getting started, Micron will be the first to announce earnings and I expect them to blow it out. This will bode well for the rest of the semiconductor players. AOSL makes key products for battery charging applications, both in car and charging stations. The demand is only just starting to explode for AOSL's products, I suspect they will get bought out at double the levels were at now."
Alpha & Omega reached a 52 Week high at 16.68
AOSL aims to generate 1 billion yearly revenue in the next few years. AOSL at least worths 3-5 billion and should can trade at least 100$ per share in the future. Hold tight!
635k shorted shares have to be covered. Go AOSL!
Stellar report
"It is a little ahead of itself, but not by much. It needs to stay in the channel.https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aosl"

congratulations to the AOS team for a very strong quarter and an equally strong outlook for this quarter. Great execution in such a difficult environment. Hope to see continuing growth in all their markets worldwide.

"Beautiful quarter, revenue & earnings growth are strong and yet the stock remains dirt cheap.In an insane market this is a hidden gem that will have its day."
Is a cup and handle forming on the 6 month chart?
"terrific earnings report yesterday and a strong outlook for next quarter. AOSL executing really well and is on track to meet their mid-term revenue goal of $600M, perhaps by 2023 if they continue to execute well."
I am loading up at this level. Incredible cash flow and future expansion in Oregon. Looking for 1 billion in annual sales in the next few years! Strong Buy!
There are 609k short shares . Be patient
"AOSL is preparing a secondary offering, stock will be stuck until offer filed."
Did anyone hear the Jeffries seminar?
fabulous presentation at Needham today. The action reflects that.
Looks like the buyer finished early today!
"52 week high! This is my sleeper stock. Never any news or anything for months and then bam, +6% in a couple hours for some reason."
"If sales continue to grow over the next two quarters and the stock price stays at these levels, the PE will be below 10. In my opinion this would create tremendous value for a company looking to expand via acquisition. AOSL could be purchased for double where it’s trading now."
"AOSL has repurchased about 6.8 million shares . It is a smart investment, Now the company only has around 26 million shares outstanding. Below is from company's 8K:As of June 30, 2021, the Company had repurchased anaggregate of 6,784,648 shares for a total cost of $67.3 million, at an averageprice of $9.92 per share, excluding fees and related expenses, since inceptionof the program.

"Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited (""AOS"") (Nasdaq: AOSL) today announced that the company will release its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 on Tuesday, August 11, 2020, after the market closes."
"Aosl still charting well, held 200 day moving ave on last consolidation and volume starting to show upturn coming now, as well as relative strength confirming upside run. Thinking stock will get over $ 33, to clear most recent high's and run to near $ 35 this run, further confirming upside momentum. Go longs!"
interesting price move up today on about 2.5-3x normal volume. I wonder why? Is Apple using any AOS parts in the new Mac or Mac mini ?? is that the reason for the upward pressure ? I don't know the short interest in AOSL so it could be a short squeeze perhaps ?
I sold all my micron this morning and moved the money to AOSL.
"The reasons I like AOSL are (1) it has own Fabs and can freely allocate capacity to high margin products in this semiconductor shortage/constraint environment; (2) Its market cap is too low and trading with 1x sale ; (3) forward PE and trailing PE is too low ( FY 2021, PE=28.68/2.93=9.79; FY 2022, PE=28.68/3.4=8.43; FY2023, PE=28.68/3.64=7.87); (4) good balance sheet and no net debt; (5) analyst' Price target is 39.50; (6) the insiders hold lots of shares: 20.51% of Shares Held by All Insider ; 58.85% of Shares Held by Institutions"
