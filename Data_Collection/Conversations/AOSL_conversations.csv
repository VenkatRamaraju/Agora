633k short shares need to be covered. AOSL has $657M revenue in 2020 and net income $2.93 per share. AOSL is trading 1x sale and PE less than 10. It is ridiculously undervalued.
"This Analyst Sees 82% Upside In Alpha & Omega Semiconductor - Read WhyBenchmark analyst David Williams initiated coverage of Alpha & Omega Semiconductor Ltd with a Buy and $55 price target, implying an 82.2% upside. The current robust demand environment has accelerated structural improvements. Williams believes Alpha & Omega has now reached a ""fundamental inflection point"" as it has achieved scale to support a long-term path of double-digit revenue growth. Revenue is becoming increasingly diversified, and new products are providing significant content expansion, Williams added."
I am loading up at this level. Incredible cash flow and future expansion in Oregon. Looking for 1 billion in annual sales in the next few years! Strong Buy!
I’m presuming that good news is in the cards seeing the share price is headed up. The smart money always seem to know something.
nice up in a down market! AOSL is extremely undervalued now.
"I like that AOSL is buying back stock however the float is thin already and this makes it thinner which institutions DON'T like. Having said that, the word is getting out that pretty much ALL semiconductor suppliers will benefit from very high demand for MOSFET's and power semiconductors in general. The next 2 quarters are in the bag , profits will rise again which I believe will drive this stock much higher. Customers are locking in orders for all of 2022 and they're willing to pay upfront, the CEO said this on the last earnings call. This speaks volumes and also tells you that demand will be strong for some time to come. I averaged down a few weeks ago and I'm glad I did. GLTA"
Both B. Riley and Benchmark analysts gave AOSL targets above 50$. It is the turn of AOSL to run.
The market finally realizes AOSL is undervalued. AOSL will reach 50 soon.
"It feels like AOSL is being manipulated, it gets slammed for no reason and then recovers. It requires more patience on our part and the fortitude not to sell. Earnings will improve again making the stock cheaper and more attractive to a potential buyer of the company. This would be a 50.00 plus dollar stock if that were to happen. This is a value stock and shareholders will be rewarded."
"Business for AOSL has never been better, demand is exceeding supply by a large amount. They can definitely demand higher prices from non strategic customers. My bet is that they will blow away numbers again this quarter which will drive the stock higher. They're in a great spot with product that is in very high demand by the EV car makers."
"From Barron's: 2 analysts have split opinions: 1 buy 1 sell. EPS estimates, >$3.00; target price, one at $52, one at $26. I heard the bear just raised his price target to $27, but maintain sell rating.Go figure! One of them must be wrong."
AOSL aims to generate 1 billion yearly revenue in the next few years. AOSL at least worths 3-5 billion and should can trade at least 100$ per share in the future. Hold tight!
"LastQ the stock was in the strong 30's and now under 30 with such growth who knows what those that shorted will do, I will be adding more for the long term as this could very well move as AMD did."
"Our trailing PE is 12, our current growth rate is 44%, we are selling at 1.8X book value AND our price to revenue is 1. This stock is being giving away and I will happily add as much as I can @ these prices."
"All Semies are down, not enough interest in AOSL to keep the price up. Unfortunately this might be the orice level until the next semis run which could be end of the year. Some consolidation will need to happen. This a solid company with new products and good growth potential. Patience will be needed. Undervalued at these levels."
"Alpha & Omega price target raised to $52 from $48 at B. Riley ( 05/06/21 )B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis raised the firm's price target on Alpha & Omega to $52 from $48 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the ""strong beat and raise"" quarter.Believe analysts will raise price target again after earnings."
Alpha and Omega Semiconductor is up 5.41% to 34.30
"You can feel that this stock is a coiled spring that will pop nicely once they announce earnings. I expect very good earnings, beating last quarters earnings."
"Investors are starting to get the message, AOSL is in a sweet spot with its power products. Demand is much higher than supply and this is across all suppliers. Pricing power is in their camp and this will be reflected when they announce their earnings. If they can show even a slight improvement, the stock price should hit mid 30’s which is still undervalued VS other semiconductor companies. I hope that the true value will be realized at some point, we should be over 40.00 when that happens."
"Alpha & Omega Q4 Adj. EPS $0.95 Beats $0.76 Estimate, Sales $177.30M Beat $170.30M Estimate4:02 pm ET August 11, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintAlpha & Omega (NASDAQ:AOSL) reported quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.76 by 25 percent. This is a 227.59 percent increase over earnings of $0.29 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $177.30 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $170.30 million by 4.11 percent. This is a 44.86 percent increase over sales of $122.39 million the same period last year."
"AOSL is still undervalued and should break new 52 week high soon, Do not forget AOSL has own fabs. That is very advangeous because AOSL can control own price and pick high margin products during semiconductor shortage periods."
It is the turn of small cap semiconductor companies especially like undervalued AOSL. AOSL will reach new 52-week high soon.
this stock is for patient investors will sell 40-55 by end next year
"Benchmark Initiates Coverage On Alpha & Omega with Buy Rating, Announces Price Target of $55"
"It appears to be on a solid upward trend, under appreciated beginning to get some attention."
It is time for undervalued small cap semiconductor comply like AOSL to shine. My ACLS is on fire today.
Nice run for AOSL & I really appreciate the non-rabid Yahoo thread.
There are 609k short shares . Be patient
"Beautiful quarter, revenue & earnings growth are strong and yet the stock remains dirt cheap.In an insane market this is a hidden gem that will have its day."
"Very disappointing valuation for AOSL, they haven’t convinced the analysts that they can manage their margin and the demand. They should buy back shares at these levels or put themselves up for sale."
"Wow, just found this company today while researching HIMX - another semi trading with a dirt cheap PE… Looks like I’ll be starting a position here tomorrow for an easy double over the next 12 months."

Doubled my small position today at 30.53 so now overall down 1%We'll see how it goes fo rwhen I may add more.It's the start of tax loss selling season - my favorite time to start new positions or add to old ones. So I may not have any more new money for AOSL.
The whole sector is down today. Patience is needed for this stock because eventually it will pop into the $35-$40 range. It can’t be ignored forever.
"Alpha & Omega price target raised to $52 from $48 at B. Riley 05/06/21 AOSL B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis raised the firm's price target on Alpha & Omega to $52 from $48 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares following the ""strong beat and raise"" quarter."
"The reasons I like AOSL are (1) it has own Fabs and can freely allocate capacity to high margin products in this semiconductor shortage/constraint environment; (2) Its market cap is too low and trading with 1x sale ; (3) forward PE and trailing PE is too low ( FY 2021, PE=28.68/2.93=9.79; FY 2022, PE=28.68/3.4=8.43; FY2023, PE=28.68/3.64=7.87); (4) good balance sheet and no net debt; (5) analyst' Price target is 39.50; (6) the insiders hold lots of shares: 20.51% of Shares Held by All Insider ; 58.85% of Shares Held by Institutions"
