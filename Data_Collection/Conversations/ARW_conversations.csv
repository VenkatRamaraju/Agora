"Solid company, under/fairly valued, good buy."
Can't imagine inventory and receivables won't show impairments next few quarters. Will the company retain high cost sales reps who can't visit customers for weeks/months? What is the true value of Goodwill on the balance sheet? I'm guessing way less than $2 billion.
How solid has this been last two months.. while as for the rest of the market.. I expect the slow steady run to continue here.. zero attention paid
