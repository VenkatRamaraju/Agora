Is this worth a buy ? Any dd
Can't imagine inventory and receivables won't show impairments next few quarters. Will the company retain high cost sales reps who can't visit customers for weeks/months? What is the true value of Goodwill on the balance sheet? I'm guessing way less than $2 billion.
So I'm here alone on this one?
Think I might start averaging in next week. Looks like a solid buy.
"Solid company, under/fairly valued, good buy."

$MOSY $5 this week easy. Donâ€™t miss it. This deal with $ARW is huge.
How solid has this been last two months.. while as for the rest of the market.. I expect the slow steady run to continue here.. zero attention paid
"Yahoo finance EPS estimates 2.17, last year 2.5 EPS, -5.6% Sales Growth and -15.6% Revenue Y/Y. Doesn't look good for earnings but gained 2% today. Thoughts?"
This stock only can do one thing: goes up!
"Has anyone heard of massive exodus of Long Term Middle Management form Arrow? Evidently, continued low or no merit increases year after year. in having an effect."
ARW showing its about to make a run to new highs. We may get a stab over $90 even $100. Takeover target?

"Rev/guidance looking decent, maybe a surprise. P/E P/S not too shabby in the low teens. Institutional investors - yes, the ones I want to see. Balance sheet.. some debt, but nothing too concerning. This is a buy with both hands - looks safe and secure."
