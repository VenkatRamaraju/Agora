"Rev/guidance looking decent, maybe a surprise. P/E P/S not too shabby in the low teens. Institutional investors - yes, the ones I want to see. Balance sheet.. some debt, but nothing too concerning. This is a buy with both hands - looks safe and secure."
Ironic that Arrow would acquire a software company when they have been unable to fully convert to Oracle after 5 years of disrupt

"""A corporation’s structure will produce better performance if and only if it improves the organization’s ability to make and execute key decisions better and faster than competitors"". In other words, a reorganization is no substitute for an effective strategic plan and the people to execute the plan. Companies that literally reorganize annually (or more frequently) project a strong indication that the Board has lost control and Senior Management doesn't have a clue."

Is this worth a buy ? Any dd
Can't imagine inventory and receivables won't show impairments next few quarters. Will the company retain high cost sales reps who can't visit customers for weeks/months? What is the true value of Goodwill on the balance sheet? I'm guessing way less than $2 billion.

Surprised Mike Long has not taken stronger action. The Mike I knew would have fired the people responsible for the shortfall including the current CFO IMO.
Think I might start averaging in next week. Looks like a solid buy.
