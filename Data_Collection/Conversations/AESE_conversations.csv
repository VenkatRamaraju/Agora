More events sports betting online paid view cant ask for more
Wow look at that cup and handle move on AESE.
Initial offer from Bally's was 100 mill for the whole company. Management sold just the WPT alone for 90 mill in cash instead.
$5 today
"Easy winner - undervalued, very little debt. Will recover nicely to $5+"
"Pretty quiet here, I don’t think anyone knows what they’re gonna do in the am, including myself lol. So much potential though."
"$AESE If you haven’t read this DD Thread yet; and are interested in this company, do it now. It will give you more confidence to invest. It’s still very undervalued for the assets and partnerships it holds.https://twitter.com/rocketmanguyman/status/1339265981294645249?s=21"
$5 tonight
Back to the drawing board.

AESE GETTING HELP FROM REDDIT SOON!
Big recovery Im back in at $3.34 Let's go
It's going to go right back up lol. It will get to the $2.50 range soon enough. Buy and hold.
All these esports are poised to have huge break outs in the coming years. Honestly this is one of my least favorites but its value is well over what it is with all the acquisitions and good news if ur bag holding at 4 wouldn't be to worried.
Why would anyone sell for these prices study the 6 month chart it’s going back over 3 and possible 4.68.
Back to $4.50 by Friday
The one-year graph is very similar to the Bitcoin Trend Reversal. Could be hitting as high as $10.
Huge increase in volume should tell you everything
is this stock a safe long term hold? I'm a little worried about these roller coaster rides
This one gonna fly too
You guys that are in for the short term trade are missing the big picture. This online gaming is the future. The folks running AESE are all gamers and know how to build a big business. In for the long haul.
somethins cookin.....
"just warn you all, if you want invest AESE, make sure you can hold for long time, the share price always go high then back to 2.++."
I have a feeling this is going to run up by spring. $10
"Any thoughts on where we’re at right now. Every board is so quiet which usually means really good, or really bad."
With the deal closing and the cash position. They should have over $100 M cash. Look at the market cap!!!
open at $3?
"Pre-market gaining momentum, was at $1.66 now back up to $1.80."
"$AESE $AESE August 21, 2020 Wall Street Journal Analyst RatingsStock Price Target AESEHigh$4.25Median$4.13Low$4.00Average$4.13See: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AESE/research-ratings"
They are doing a Great job increasing Shareholder value maybe they got those words confused with enriching themselves at the expense of the common Shareholder.. JMHO
esports are the future
"It's gonna be a fun Friday. Had tremendous luck all week - $MOGO crushed it for me, $AESE crushed it, $MVIS crushed it....now just waiting for $FD.V to come through with some double-digit gains."
Out boys made easy $21k swing trading this past hour ...might trade it later depending on how it looks
Keep on buying this thing will be double maybe even triple by the end of August￼
Guys I hope the bottom is in cause this was a lot better than expected...
"at 3.47 some people took profits. That is the problem why it is running low. Cannot blame them, entire market is red"
here it goes!!!
Huge buys coming in lets go guys keep pumping.
Helloooooooo????
"Insider Knighted Pastures LLC reports buying 388,190 shares of $AESE for a total cost of $574,730.28"
"Hey all, Thinking about starting a position here... Thoughts?"
Is this even worth holding? Been in since like 4.60 lol
competitor SLGG rising too. read somewhere SLGG is another reddit play but no confirmation. their vol up to 78m. no news for either I can find
One of my favorite stocks for $10
2.80 next
This stock will hit the 1.70s tomorrow and maybe $2 Friday
I don’t see where this is coming from either. It’s not on WSBs thread.
Plenty of room to run. Looking forward to tomorrow. Good luck people!
Just loosing money everyday(( Nothing looks good.I have no idea what to do sell or hold little more..

Check out $AESE as well. Huge upside Potential in March with Gaming becoming more popular than ever. I can see this on in double digits soon
loading time before take off
How do you think the earnings will turn out on March 31st?
"I own both, but SLGG’s prospects are better."
I think they are probably trying to sell the company which would pay a premium to shareholders currently undervalued share price
what's up with the high volume today?
-$5000 today Not good
Ready for takeoff....
Who would be selling other than shorts ??
"Load up. Bally's offered on 3-1 then upsized on 3-3, they want this badly. Second bidder will arrive."
"This was up 30% yesterday, down 30% today and everyone cries about losses! If this goes sub 2.20 I’m doubling my position."
AESE Only a 6.5 million share Float! And $2.15 book value! This is a Screaming Buy!
Open 2.75 tomorrow and then slow fall to under 2
$10 soon.
"Rising with heavy volume. #Technical indicators are looking bullish, according to stoxline."
 I like it. Great week next week
to the moon..
Who is long on this stock ?
Think this has a chance to go above 4 again.
"I think SP can go up higher, if :1. Bally's come back with better offer2. If Allied rejects Bally's offer 3. If there is a bidding war involving another entity like MGM groupThe outlook is excellent for this sector and especially this company that owns WPT.Buy and hold . . .to see what happens . . .GLTA!"
Wow wow wow
"I have been meaning to get back in here and forgot. Glad for the dip this AM. now, let's go."
"Incredible opportunity here ......when Allied start in the betting business on Esports here , Germany , Australia an the big market of Asia ...... after the end of april they reach the money to start this way ."
Huge buying!!!
"Poor Bally's offer, 2.56 per share or thereabouts. we can do better at least drawing attention"
I am stuck between a few a stocks to invest in. this one $opgn or $itrm. newer to the game. would appreciate any input. thanks
Going up to $4 easy today
Is this deal actually going through by end of April? Or did they change a mind again?! No news is not good news when it comes to AESE
Way better than expected will expect this to go up tomorrow guys.
Think we get a late day surge?
painfully valued at under 80 million
"Should be interesting night, let’s make another 30-40% b4 the weekend starts"
Ive made a lot of money on this stock buying close to $2 and selling over $2.25 on many different occasions. Thousands of shares at a time. One of these days itll kill me and drop to $1 for 3 months tying up all my money but until then im gonna keep going
^^^Relief Rally Tomorrow AM on Nasdaq
What’s the predictions this can go too
Who is buying this up???? I’m not complaining I just wanna know what’s going on
After the sale of WPT is complete the company will officially have more cash then the value of there current market cap. You are basicaly getting the other half of there buissness for free buying at 2$ USD. The other half of there buissness has been valued at between 30 million and 50 million in the past giving this company 40%-80% upside if they sold the other half of there buissness to become a shell company again. Or they can do a acquisition and basicaly start over with a new company either way the company is in fact undervalued at the current market cap regardless of what happens.
I bought 100 shares on a whim @ 1.75 since it was linked to e-sports. man am I happy to see its above 4.00 this morning. whats the news? debating on unloading or holding.
do you think i should buy...poll!
6$/7$+++ by next month
"I’ve played this one for about a year. Two years ago, right out of the ipo it dropped to $5. That’s the highest it’s been. It likes to move between $1 and $4. It’s a good one to short hold if you play it right. I’ve turned it 3 times. First time I bought at $4 and everyone was all, To the moon” . Then it dropped like a rock and I bought again at $1. Was able to break even at $2.50. Then two more time I doubled my money. It has dropped to under $1, and that’s when you can make some good money."
Massive potential.I’m in LONG.
It’s funny how people want to start positions after a stock has gone up loo
had a weird feeling about this and scooped some up just before the market closed.... not complaining rn. hoping tomorrow will be a big one!
1.6 million members last time wouldn’t be surprised if they have 4 plus million members on the next PR
starting the week off with a bang...hoping for some news!
Long term!
"I bought 10,000 more shares yesterday at $1 per share. I have a total of 12, 400 shares all together. I guess I'll be in this for the Long haul"
Can anyone say bidding war?
Halted in premarket already. This will be interesting.
Wow. Great time to buy. Yeah. Sure.
Is any one still in this company? And what’s going on with it ? Any update? Or anything? Lmk on your thoughts very curious
:o
get ready for the squeeze towards the end of day. I expect this to get back up to at least $5 once hedge funds load up during power hour. This dip is caused by amateur shorts who sell early
Buy buy buy!!!
Who thinks back to 4 next week?
BIG DIPS on NO news says BUY to me. This was $3.60 a few days ago!! It will recover.
hold 2k @2.90 ..loosing money ...
What happened
"Load up , you thank me later"
This company is extremely undervalued. I expect this will squeeze hard. Now we know shorts jumped on today so once it lifts off the squeeze will be on. I expect a new 52 week high very soon...easy!
final buyout news tonight at 5PM
buyout tomorrow? $3.5/share ez
waking up to 7% gains
volume keeps going lower and lower
Realistically? What are we thinking here? $5 next week?
3.28 after hours gap up Monday
Some news coming likely by Friday. Keep an eye out...
3 dollars tomorrow
gaming industry to reach 230 billion in revenue by 2022 and this is a disrupter a game changer to the industry. this is going to be wow    good luck
It’s all about the 10 year and the 30 year bond price spike in interest rates. Wall Street just doing their thing. After hours should be ok I would buy more but I loaded the boat at 2.28
No way this company should be sold for anything less than $5 a share. Anything less is unacceptable.
Is there any reason to buy this company?
"WPT Sale, how will this affect the stock price?"
Buy buy buy
good gambling stock for day Traders but I personally believe these Esports are going to take off again gaming is quite a following and once it's legal to just bet I hear voices saying come on give us a break to make money with this game... This is what probably could happen so I'm holding
something is cooking.somebody knows something
"A big positive move today with huge volume for AESE. I invested in the WPT brand and that alone is worth its market cap IMHO. The big insider ownership is another factor to consider. Shareholder and insiders goals are thus aligned. As gaming continue to gather steam, the potential at this level could be huge. God Bless and stay well all."
Hello?
"Mind-blowing that we're seeing levels in the $1.20 range.. I've been watching this stock almost daily for 2 years and feel like I have a good handle on the trends. 99.9% sure we won't see it gall below $1.10 and 90% sure we will see $2+ definitely before the EOY. Disclaimer: Purchased 3k today to bring my average down to $1.43, which I am more than happy with. GLTA"
25% AFTER PRE MARKET ALREADY?
"As a gamer myself, the next generation will all be gamers. I’m excited to see how this company capitalized on the gaming industry. Maybe the ESPN or ESports"
"Someone AESE already, thanks!"
Sold half my stack at 3. Thought it would have pumped more. But holding my other half as this news sets a good target date so should see steady rise going toward that date or more news will come related to the opening which will make it pop
$gmbl inked a multiyear deal with the new england patriots and new england evolution and is currently down on the day if anyone is looking for a similar play.
5$coming soon
"I'm so glad I bought 10,000 shares last week"
"Added 2,000 more  long term "

Ok let’s make some money  this week
today was last time we will see it under $3
What is fundamentally wrong with this company?
"sup folks! just bought AESE today; this is a gem that little know about, it has IMMENSE potential; i trust it to take care of my cash; i also predict a cute little pulse in the next 2-3 weeks thatll get the show rollin! well find out super soon!"
^^^Loose Money
"closing of transaction March 31st $68,000,000 up front Cash on Balance Sheet with 10% revenue share of remaining $10,000,000 payable payments for 3 years after closing"
"new CEO that specializes in acquisitions, could be looking to add a new product line with the 105 million or having the Esports division acquired by another company, in any scenario it doesn't warrant a 5-6% drop today"
"Let the bidding begin. Of course, let's all reject that offer from Bally's."
Will it ever go over $1 again Am not sure
Can we run with the bidding war and break 3.50 and keep going please. Would be great.
￼ I know a lot about this company go look back the last month you’ll be seeing me comment all the time I’ve been in this chat for a very long time you guys just came out of the shadows I haven’t seen you guys ever in this chat when it blows up so kick rocks you guys don’t know nothing about it and have a good day￼
Any other gaming sector pick that is as invested in INFRATSTRUCTURE as much as AESE? Any of this being considered? We should all be very excited about the prospects of this company. May be darling of Q3-Q4 (if Covid stays at bay)
Bidding War ?
blowstocks website featured this stock with target $15
please give me hope
How do you think about AESE??? If they sell WTP what do you think will happen???
2.91 -2.95 next resistance
Don’t know why anyone would sell here. More money for poker tour and they keep esports. We were trading in the high 3.50 on the other deal.
Give her some time folks ;)
"The pandemic has disrupted many businesses and industries. AESE is interesting because of its WPT brand business aside from its other businesses. With gaming gaining legal status in more states and esports being big and growing in popularity, the current low market cap looks to me a good opportunity to get in. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
Glad I sold early in AH at 3.41.Tanking now
Shouldn't MGM be irritated by Bally's offer? I mean the HyperX Esports Arena is in the Luxor which is an MGM property.
Hopefully a Nasdaq relief rally for the first half of Friday trading.
Not selling a single one coz this has less to loose and more to gain let the market do the thing
Tomorrow $2 plus by next week $2.50 + and then once we have the event update we be in $3 + zone
Probably going to go up AHrs and Gap up in the morning....Too much intrest and not enough shares. I'm buying for the long haul to $10.
Think this moons in the next week
"Would like to see some insider purchases at this share price. If I could buy a $100 bill for $60, I think I would."
I have been saying this could be a 4.68 stock and I will not sell any under 4.00
Checkout the insiders buying in Finviz... They are buying huge.
People haven’t realized that this stock will recover as COVID calms down... just hold on to your hats folks
insider buying. 3 different transactions 2 for 1.5 mil another today for 3 mil
Why so many news and it’s not going up?! Shld I hold my position at $3.85?!
What’s up with post-market?
Delisting coming.
Should I pick up 10k shares Monday........this is the dilemma
I will keep buying tomorrow. This stock belongs in 10 - 12
"This company appears to be just waiting everything out and banking on the fact their arenas can open again. I realize this IS their business, but they are not really doing anything in the interim to advance the company in the new normal."
