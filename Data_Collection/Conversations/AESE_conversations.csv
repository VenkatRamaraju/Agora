I don’t see where this is coming from either. It’s not on WSBs thread.
I think they are probably trying to sell the company which would pay a premium to shareholders currently undervalued share price
why the jump
I am stuck between a few a stocks to invest in. this one $opgn or $itrm. newer to the game. would appreciate any input. thanks
Should I pick up 10k shares Monday........this is the dilemma
Tomorrow $2 plus by next week $2.50 + and then once we have the event update we be in $3 + zone
$5 today
buyout tomorrow? $3.5/share ez
They are maximizing Shareholder value.Only problem is the SP is going in the wrong direction. JMHO
something is cooking.somebody knows something
Is this company still in business ? Does anyone know and are they still doing events ? ￼￼￼
Is any one still in this company? And what’s going on with it ? Any update? Or anything? Lmk on your thoughts very curious
Who is buying this up???? I’m not complaining I just wanna know what’s going on
After the sale of WPT is complete the company will officially have more cash then the value of there current market cap. You are basicaly getting the other half of there buissness for free buying at 2$ USD. The other half of there buissness has been valued at between 30 million and 50 million in the past giving this company 40%-80% upside if they sold the other half of there buissness to become a shell company again. Or they can do a acquisition and basicaly start over with a new company either way the company is in fact undervalued at the current market cap regardless of what happens.
"A big positive move today with huge volume for AESE. I invested in the WPT brand and that alone is worth its market cap IMHO. The big insider ownership is another factor to consider. Shareholder and insiders goals are thus aligned. As gaming continue to gather steam, the potential at this level could be huge. God Bless and stay well all."
With the deal closing and the cash position. They should have over $100 M cash. Look at the market cap!!!
Buy buy buy
Not selling a single one coz this has less to loose and more to gain let the market do the thing
I have a feeling this is going to run up by spring. $10
5$coming soon
"Still think this stock will pop when we see some M&A activity. That may take some time. In the meantime, would be good to see some data on on the LV Arena engagement, as well as online competition #'s."
Helloooooooo????
volume keeps going lower and lower
$10 soon.
"This company appears to be just waiting everything out and banking on the fact their arenas can open again. I realize this IS their business, but they are not really doing anything in the interim to advance the company in the new normal."
Average volume 2 million....today 140 million....you tell me where this is headed in the next couple days! See you at $5-$7+ by Friday!
"Load up. Bally's offered on 3-1 then upsized on 3-3, they want this badly. Second bidder will arrive."
here we go
No way this company should be sold for anything less than $5 a share. Anything less is unacceptable.
Hello?
"I’ve played this one for about a year. Two years ago, right out of the ipo it dropped to $5. That’s the highest it’s been. It likes to move between $1 and $4. It’s a good one to short hold if you play it right. I’ve turned it 3 times. First time I bought at $4 and everyone was all, To the moon” . Then it dropped like a rock and I bought again at $1. Was able to break even at $2.50. Then two more time I doubled my money. It has dropped to under $1, and that’s when you can make some good money."
They are doing a Great job increasing Shareholder value maybe they got those words confused with enriching themselves at the expense of the common Shareholder.. JMHO
I will keep buying tomorrow. This stock belongs in 10 - 12
what is driving this today?
"Would like to see some insider purchases at this share price. If I could buy a $100 bill for $60, I think I would."
All these esports are poised to have huge break outs in the coming years. Honestly this is one of my least favorites but its value is well over what it is with all the acquisitions and good news if ur bag holding at 4 wouldn't be to worried.
Any other gaming sector pick that is as invested in INFRATSTRUCTURE as much as AESE? Any of this being considered? We should all be very excited about the prospects of this company. May be darling of Q3-Q4 (if Covid stays at bay)
Who is long on this stock ?
"i got it at 5.5 , any hope it will go back."
HERE COMES THE SHORT SQUEEZE TO $5
