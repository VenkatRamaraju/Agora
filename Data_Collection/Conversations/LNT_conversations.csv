2nd quarter earnings release after market close on Thursday. Conference call Friday morning. Ex-dividend last week. Life goes on.
Just stumbled on an article that was discussing dividend reinvestment plans. Brought up LNT. I had no idea they had a plan that reinvested dividends and allowed you to make monthly cash contributions commission free (LNT covers the fees) only thing I can assume is they are selling treasurey shares? Anyway the author said he did $25 a monthhttp://mvpstockpicks.com/how-to-start-investing-in-stocks-with-only-100-in-your-pocket/

"LNT pretty much flat over past 2 years, while Dow is up 40 percent in that timeframe. Good thing I am diversified, though I've never been a fan of rebalancing, which I regard as selling winners and buying more losers. At least we have a fair 3.4 percent annualized dividend."
Up on a down day.Very nice.
remains on Valueline div portfolio...so only a div play 0 upside

Good old LNT. Began dripping in in 1980 and today I past 50K in it. So far all dividends have been reinvested.
big move up in the Valueline Div Portfolio
Was hoping for a bigger dividend increase .09 isnâ€™t much.
that maybe so about LMT dividend reinvestment in cash purchase plan but they're screwing over the customers with their wind energy project by raising prices already on April 2019 there's a lot of people in Iowa that are retired live in older homes in can't afford to upgrade two more energy efficient insulation projects it's going to cost you probably $24 a month minimum or a lot of people that are retired that's a lot of money for their retirement from Social Security
