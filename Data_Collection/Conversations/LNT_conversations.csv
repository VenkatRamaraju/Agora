"LNT pretty much flat over past 2 years, while Dow is up 40 percent in that timeframe. Good thing I am diversified, though I've never been a fan of rebalancing, which I regard as selling winners and buying more losers. At least we have a fair 3.4 percent annualized dividend."

"Great stock, I've owned since 2003 and have done very well. How long have others held onto this one? Any really long time holders? I buy through the DRIP, what a deal."
Just stumbled on an article that was discussing dividend reinvestment plans. Brought up LNT. I had no idea they had a plan that reinvested dividends and allowed you to make monthly cash contributions commission free (LNT covers the fees) only thing I can assume is they are selling treasurey shares? Anyway the author said he did $25 a monthhttp://mvpstockpicks.com/how-to-start-investing-in-stocks-with-only-100-in-your-pocket/
Was hoping for a bigger dividend increase .09 isnâ€™t much.
2.8 concensus a miss on eps ...I threw a bunch on BA. and winning
"Eked out another all time high. Flight to safety? Not exactly getting rich, but holding value well."
that maybe so about LMT dividend reinvestment in cash purchase plan but they're screwing over the customers with their wind energy project by raising prices already on April 2019 there's a lot of people in Iowa that are retired live in older homes in can't afford to upgrade two more energy efficient insulation projects it's going to cost you probably $24 a month minimum or a lot of people that are retired that's a lot of money for their retirement from Social Security
LNT reached a new All Time High at $46.52
Love my Alliant.
Alliant Energy is up 4.98% to 57.29
Why is the stock dropping in price??
"This is puzzling for me, everything almost looks perfect except for of course high PE, but PEG is also high forward PE is lower, beta is pretty low, but LFCF is in negative territory, cant figure out whats their deal perhaps issuance of new shares would be nice"
