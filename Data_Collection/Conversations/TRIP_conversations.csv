"Travel is down, advertising is down, market is down, TRIP is up. Makes sense."
"December 23, 2020Today $HBOR fly's high for a 3rd consecutive day after releasing news confirming the closing of a deal for a dispensary. Over the past 2 days, the share price has gone up 16 cents or 10%.#MMJ #OTC #PENNYSTOCKS #SMALLCAPS #PROFITS #CSE #TSXV $HBOR $CLSH $TRIP"
"better get in the flying sector, rtp expc eh a little lowersndl callsSektorhooders know who Sektor the whale is"
"Was directed here by somebody on the $TRIP CEO board. MMJGAADZILLA ring a bell? Anyways, heard this was a scam, and the pumped up numbers are fake. Pumpers are happy about a low market cap with a bit of cash in the bank...but this company has no future. How does that make sense?"
"I can’t believe they got Russell peters to be the creative director of the company that is definitely trippy , I tripped out when I heard that news for $TRIP.CNLooks like vireo health fired Bruce Linton I think because he didn’t care for cannabis companies anymore and was more so supporting red light Holland then they got angry and let him go lol. Oh well that’s too bad for them. Like it or not Bruce has a lot of connections due to his past role of ceo of tweed. It’s hard to recreate the tweed legacy with vireo, there will only be one tweed not sure what vireo were thinking, however with red light Holland this reminds me of the beginnings of tweed, niche market something new, I think Bruce likes to lobby the government for change too so let’s see what happens and where that would bring us in the future but for now creating a strong brand in NL is a great idea."
Full Buyout Team ready to go for merger
"I can’t believe they got Russell peters to be the creative director of the company that is definitely trippy , I tripped out when I heard that news for $TRIP.CN"
Unusual option activity speculating a possible takeover. 12000 Jan 35 options were purchased
TRIP is up 6.20% to 37.83
$TRIP is where everybody goes to hedge against their losses.
"Was definitely a better ER than I was expecting. Gonna stay patient, give the stock until tomorrow afternoon to see how the overall market views the numbers, and the path going forward. Stock is already settling down after the initial relief pop to the upside. I have about 20 hours worth of patience, and I think there is still a very good chance this turns around and dips to under $30 tomorrow. Good Luck to All!"

Anyone have any experience/thoughts on TripAdvisor Plus?
"So what’s the difference between $TRIP and $BUZZ, they seem to be affiliated￼? Should I buy $BUZZ shares instead due to a cheaper share price? Thanks"
"Anthony Druakcz also invested into $Grat at 5 cents , look where it`s at now, High tide doing decent.$TRIP did decent from 5 cents its at 30 now"
Where is the drop bud?
"Pure opening, travel trade.Travel is going to explode. Can it run to all time highs into the summer?"
"Adding more every day to to keep averaging out my 145k shares during this correction. Does anybody honestly see a future where mushrooms aren’t mainstream? It’s already being sold online in US and Canada. The government and big pharma will not not cash in on it. $TRIP.CN is going to the moon, but it’s not going to happen overnight. Diamond hands folks :)"
$TRIP Moved up 2 cents or 6.7% to close at 32 cents on over 1.59 million shares traded incl ATS. A pretty exciting day for a slow Monday in Canada when the US markets were closed for Memorial Day.$SPDR $CLSH $HBOR
Merry Christmas $TRIP holders!All the best for 2021.
"Today, we will fight again! This is gonna be a very blessed and beautiful week guys! Good luck to all and God bless!! $TRIP to heaven!!!"
It's amazing to see that 1M shares pushed it up by about $2.5 within half an hour.. I am amazed!
to those who think they missed the SHROOM BOOM train on $MMED & $NUMI don't forget about $RVV $TRIP.CN & $SPOR.CN get in early and ride the trains to 10x + im a long term mmed & numi buyer who got in the 0.60s
How does TRIP shrink revenue and earnings when the economy is growing?
Doubled my money here in under a quarter. sold half of holdings and playing with house money now. doubled down on puts and up 100% again. good long term hold just a correction happening now from recent run up.
"Anyone see $TRIP is up 18%, anyone know why? I still believe $NUMI is the top dog of them all."
"Mushrooms the more people learn about it the more I think people will want to try for themselves , red light Holland wants to do recreational first then eventually one day dive into the medical side of things they are doing it in reverse compared to Canada’s rollout in the sense that Canada first started with medical cannabis then went recreational. $TRIP wants to do recreational first then dive into the medical biotech aspect of it."
"TripAdvisor misses by $0.09, misses on revsReports Q1 (Mar) earnings of $0.07 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.09 worse than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.16; revenues fell 26.1% year/year to $278 mln vs the $290.63 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.""We estimate daily bookings and revenue across our segments and products declined year-over-year generally by more than 90% during late March, and this trend continued through April."""
Fill the gap
Anyone know how earnings look? I don't expect much given the covid.
report the people promoting other tickers. this is a $TRIP discussion board not a place to promote companies you are holding the bag for
"TRIP management needs to better advertise that they are an alternative to AirBB and VRBO, both of which have horrible customer service."

"Trip needs to merge with Trvg for its own survival, to grow hotel business and be more valuable to booking and Expedia. Perfect fit!"
WowWhat’s wrong with the stock market
"You Guys are watching?!!!!! It will go down to below $30.50 by the end of the day. TRIP has no future. It's not a tech company, its not Amazon, its not Facebook, it had nothing to offer..... Look at the down-trending chart, look at the moving averages, look at the PE. The big player use pops like this to exit. I won't be surprised if by the end of tomorrow's trading, it will be down 5%.The charts speak for themselves....Let me know what you think friends."

"Might this have been overblown? What’s the EPS on this stock? If it was just the earning missed, which is already in the rearview mirror, what’s the outlook is what I am interested in. The stock valuation is high but has the fundamentals changed before and after the results?Not sure if the travel business has in fact picked up or on the downward slope, can anyone share their objective views. I don’t mean to be disrespectful but no hypers or dumpers please."
I find it interesting how they disappoint on earnings and the very next day Piper Jaffray maintains their neutral rating but raises their price target - very interesting indeed.Maybe they need to hold the price levels while they dump. Hmmm
"$TRIP Red Light Holland Corp closed the day up 1 cent or 3.2% to finish on its high of 32.5 cents on 2.67 million shares. Great volume considering the daily average is 1.47 million. This one has been slowly going back up under the radar.I can feel the shorts starting to squirm. Shorts recently went up by 696,000 shares and TRIP is still moving up. That means they shorted when the SP was lower.If we keep going up tomorrow, shorts will be chasing the stock again."
"All travel websites stocks are crashing $EXPE, $TRIP, $BKNG in preparation for AirBnB IPO next year. AirBnB is verifying all room listings now and becoming a serious player in this space, and a lot of money will flow to its IPO."
"#HBOR was hot over the past 2 weeks, giving me a cashed in profit of $68,000CDN. With those funds I placed some cash in my RRSP & TSFA. Also, I managed to buy some #VN, #TRIP & #CLSH shares. Santa was good to me. Happy New Year to you, your family and extended family."

Good company and will not go under but this price is high..it has to come down at least 30% from here...I personally think it will go under 13 before 2nd quarter...will buy it around 12
psychedelics are in a bull market led by CMPSbut #TRIP is the only one that has shown a way to generate $$$ by actually sellling the stuff

"Great day! In at .29 this morning.Does this continue to grow tomorrow and going forward? Any thoughts on potential pullback? $TRIP.CNThis company has huge potential but also very volatile, wondering when I should start setting stop limits etc or chunking off profit. Does any one know how to see after hours market prices ?"
Did anyone do any research on Brad J Lamb at first I didn’t understand why it made sense to get a real estate mogul to join $Trip do you guys have any ideas why they would hire him? I’m trying to connect the dots why would they need a superstar real estate personality to join the team? What real estate aspect would play a role for trip? Hmmmm
"July 15, 2021#TRIP rallied today after Globe Newswire released a story featuring the following video with Bruce Linton, founder of #WEED & Todd Shapiro. The stock closed up 2.5 cents or 8.5% to finish at 32 cents.https://lnkd.in/eNNHwMF#HBOR #VM #CLSH"
Priceline showed much better earing and down -5.61% ...........think
"Pre markets looking very strong. Full disclosure: I added more $TRIP at .34, $NM ( Novamind ) at $1.60, and $MMED at $2.99. These 3 will lead each of their fields respectively - and soon RLH will have a new path with the Mera Deal. I expect lots of green today. All 3 major index’s are very green."
In because of Bruce! Same reason I’m in on $TRIP
"After 8 years, TRIP stock actually lost value. Not a very good buy and hold. There are many other stocks way better."
"Was looking for travel stocks a month or so ago and found this, It was a very good investment. I already doubled my money and this company will thrive during summer especially with more people going out. It had a very fast run up thats why it is down recently but it's just a correction."
Non hotel is growing amazingly fast... Good time to buy here down a bit
"Expect a pop tomorrow, 5% to 7%"
"I like $trip just as much as the next guy, but does anybody else feel like there’s a branding problem? Twitter is red, their merch is pink. I hats a guy gotta do to get a red hat around here"
"Portland $trip club forced to close, now dancers do delivery and shows in personTips are via a SERVICE FEE $50 per round trip"
"I have serious doubts whether TripAdvisor is going to be solvent when all is said and done. I would optimistically expect that they have seen a 50% drop in revenue and likely will for the next 6 months. Looking at their cash flow statement, this would put them in a position to be absolutely hemorrhaging cash. It is pretty clear they need will need to take on substantial amounts of debt to continue operations. They currently have access to a 1.2B revolving credit line and no long term debt which helps. No one is sure exactly how long it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to end. Estimates tend to range from 6 months to a year. Given that, it's questionable whether Trip Advisor will be able to stay in business unless it is able to find additional lines of credit. I think there is still considerable downside from here. At a share price of $5-7 they would normally start to become an attractive acquisition target, but with the economic fallout still unclear, it's hard to know who exactly would be in a position to both want to own TRIP and able to complete the acquisition."
Just an update for my followers... I has started to accumulate shares of #NUMI & #MMED after getting involved with #TRIP. The psychedelic mushroom & truffle business must be one of the hottest plays at the moment making people easy money. #CLSH #HBOR #VM #MONEY #INVESTING #OTC #NEO #CSE #TSXV
Guys check out RED LIGHT HOLLAND $TRIP it's a new one going to be a good one bruce linton and rusell peters joined the company they can legally sell truffle mushrooms in holland. check it out
"This company is going to the ground. More travel restrictions and more competition. I used their platform but I much rather book with airbnb and skyscanner for air travel.. It is a simple equation, how many people have used tripadvisor here to book anything travel related? My go to is airbnb.Let me know!"
$300 million convertible note offering versus a $7.2 billion market cap? This stock is overreacting to nothing. A new subscription model and the reopening of travel. Could be over $100+ within 4-6 months.
Why is everyone in this chat confusing the TRIP ticker of Tripadvisor with the ticker TRIP.CN that is a complete different company. Tripadvisor going to $0. Airbnb is the new way to book. Not many people use tripadvisor to make a booking.
33+ close today
What happened that turned this around today?CEO was on CNBC a few days ago and host was asking why they never deliver on any of their promises and/or new products. She was asking in reference to their new Plus product. He gave some babbling answer. But her question was correct. This company has been disappointing the Street for years now.
exciting times with $TRUFF $TRIP
"read the ""outlook"" section of investor letter if you want a good laugh"
Red light holland $TRIP $TRUFF shareholders knowing Bruce didn’t sell a single Red Light Holland share .... and he’s only part of two psychedelic companies...the last MJ company he was apart of became the worlds largest...and $TRIP is exactly like $WEED......1+1=.....
"THE TRAIN HAS LEFT THE STATION,AND PICKING UP SPEED."
Don’t buy shares now because Deutschland needs to dump at higher prices. None of the other important travel stocks are moving higher. Stocks like carnival and American Airlines haven’t gained a dime. There’s no recovery without them as a group.
Buyout @$65 possible
"I will be Selling Short TRIP just before market close today, as a Pure Earning play. This is a company in trouble and today's AH earnings report should cement this fact. The numbers will be bad and Guidance will also be bad. This should result in a significant price correction to around the $15 level tomorrow. TRIP is fully dependent upon people traveling. And I am not talking business travel but rather discretionary leisure travel. Anyone who thinks that people will be eager to take discretionary leisure trips anytime in 2020 is completely wrong. The Coronavirus casts a huge shadow over every aspect of the travel industry for the foreseeable future. A shadow dark enough to perhaps obliterate TRIP. TRIP is a company that will struggle to survive for the next few years. Given that fact it is way over-priced and this Short Sell offers an excellent risk/reward ratio."
"After a disappointing close last Friday, #HBOR is back in the green closing up 14 cents or 5.09% WOW. I truly hope this is the beginning of another exciting week. We should be hearing soon regarding the completion of the grow farm expansion. The larger cash crop should increase revenues by 30%, maybe even more. #CLSH #TRIP #VM #MONEY #INVESTING"

"I love my Zombie stock! TRIP is now right at the low of day. Another .39 cents down, to $16.00, and my Short Sell will be covered for a great profit of over $20k! Patience is a virtue and I have no intention of settling for even a single penny above $16.00. Still got 3 more hours today, and if not today, I'll gladly stay short and wait for tomorrow."
TRIP is down -6.92% to 37.28
"Guidance is everything here, and they danced around that in the release."
$30 by the end of the month
Rusell Peters and Bruce Linton Joined $TRIP Red Light Holland!!!
Nice to see Bruce Linton on the advisory board for $TRIP.CN
Has anyone heard anything about $trip and $mmed signing some sort of deal? Seen some chatter on Twitter but can’t seem to find anything otherwise....
Wasn't it expected that revenue would be lower given all the Boeing issues?
"@James where you at? wait I know, buying $TRIP at 0.90 LOL"
"This company has everything, air B&B, Expedia and Bookings plus real guests pictures and comments, when you go across the world you want to know exactly what to expect, because this company hotel across the world treat you better, they don’t want bad reviews on Trip advisor, you can reserve table in any place and buy tickets to any attractions and concerts....they have lots of potential to be number 1,"
"$TRIP AND $BUZZ GUNNA BE A PARTY, buzz owns the stores trip is selling their products !"
BUY: $TRIPMake up for this mess you’ve all got yourselves in..
sooooo Is this going back to 44?
Eliza you are a smart trader. I have shorted 3000 shares after hours!
SHORT: $HBORBUY: $TRIP $TRUFF
"mmedf is shorted 42% Monday will or could, be explosive #mmed #trip"
Oh I just love it when $trip holds this strong in the market crash. Every major stock is 10%+ down
Why goes down with good earnings?
I am humbled and thrilled to be right!!!!TRIP WILL SET A NEW 52 WEEK LOW.M SOON. SELL!!!!!SHORT!!!!!
TripAdvisor is up 9.04% to 43.53
If you are going to give TRIP $100+ per year give a thumbs up.
earnings report nothing but a dream of future growth. Reported 6 cents a share when expected 14 cents. HMMMM...this is reflecting EXPE bad earnings report that was 50% under expected earnings
buy orders in! $spor.cn $trip.cn $rvv.cn hopefully its just like $mmed & $numi.v my growth in those are insane right now.
What would TRIP be worth on a BUYOUT ?
"$TRIP family, if you have ever believed in something strong and real - then hold til the dollar not to the pennies!!!!HOLD!!!!"
"Planes are not flying, ships are not sailing, resorts are closed, beaches are closed, Las Vegas is shut down, so can someone explain to me, how is it that TRIP is up on Wednesday."
Supposedly Terry booth from Aurora is a major shareholder of $TRIP but is also on the $BUZZ team I wonder what that could signify? Also $BUZZ own a major Eurozone distribution pharma license or something along those lines. I remember reading that somewhere.
made $5Mstock up $1Bput the manipulators in a North Korean prison contact the SEC
Who heard or knows anything about SEC investigation for stock exchange manipulations for TRIP and Deutsche Bank with forecast before options?
"The only legal mushroom company that is able to sell truffles through their red light Holland brand in the Netherlands that is also a public listed company. Mushrooms the more people learn about it the more I think people will want to try for themselves , red light Holland wants to do recreational first then eventually one day dive into the medical side of things they are doing it in reverse compared to Canada’s rollout in the sense that Canada first started with medical cannabis then went recreational. $TRIP wants to do recreational first then dive into the medical biotech aspect of it.I can’t believe they got Russell peters to be the creative director of the company that is definitely trippy , I tripped out when I heard that news for $TRIP.CN"
Congratulations to $TRIP for going up in value by approximately 40% in the past 2 business days after hitting a low of 22.5 cents earlier in the week.#SPILOCYBIN $NUMI $MMED

My thinking is that the partnership between $TRIP & $BUZZ will strengthen. they are invested in one another & benefit from symbiotic growth; they're success is co-dependent in a way - no worries here; waiting for the Spike

"At Tripadvisor, a filing with the SEC revealed that on Thursday, CEO Stephen Kaufer purchased 44,444 shares of TRIP, for a cost of $21.73 each, for a total investment of $965,768. Investors have the opportunity to snag TRIP even cheaper than Kaufer did, with the stock changing hands as low as $20.21 in trading on Monday which is 7.0% below Kaufer's purchase price."
I think imma take a $TRIP to the moon
This is un unexpected ride. Up up and away. Going to see $50 soon!

$TRIP New Mushroom Stock !!! Going to be a good one
Will the Mera deal close this week? What do you predict will be next for $TRIP? The Psychedelics Insights acquisition seems like a great logical step to close?
"After waking up to the insurmountable amount of chat regarding MindMed’s CEO JR selling off many millions worth of shares this past week ( he let go about 30% months back - which led to public outcry - and recently another 36% +/- ) I have to say with the intimate confidence, I am MORE than proud to be heavily invested into Red Light Holland - where no shareholder has sold a single share or exercised an option. Insiders at RLH do not appear to be using their share positions as a personal piggy bank. Whatever JR had to do with his money to get where he is today, clearly was not sensible. People who are smart with money, no not do what JR is doing. Be PROUD you have management with $TRIP that isn’t dumping shares. I mean, it’s hard to dump shares when your stock is UNDER valued - it’s very easy to dump shares like JR did when your stock is OVER valued. Yes, Mindmed is over valued. There is zero revenue to justify the share price. I could not be more proud to support RLH. I know you see this Todd! Thank you!"
"Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as ""the Pisanis of the world"""
Every single one of TRIPs businesses was already under huge pressure from competition before the panic. This will be a death nail in the TRIP coffin. Change the ticker to tR.I.P.
The new partnership with TCOM one of the biggest travel company in China will have a strong impact on Trip revenues here .. just bought in a new position here for this reason !!
$90.00 is the target goal

In a different market this stock could have been DOWN 20% after this terrible quarter. If it was trading at some ridiculously cheap multiple I could maybe see a bounce but it is already trading at 38X forward earnings according to Yahoo.

$trip.cn is getting attention now. Finally.
I told everyone LAST quarter (see my post below) that this was a disaster and you shouldn't believe all the pumping. Their statements (and sell side commentary) was literally not believable but as always....some people did. Last quarter stock should have been down 20% as I said....well at least not we are on the right track. If we were not in a bubble stock would be down 20%.

"$TRIP.CN conversationI see from the posts there are a lot of anxious Investors, Followers and Bashers, for RLH to really take off and I believe they will, but for this to happen, many bridges will have to be built and roads crossed.If I had to do an analysis on this Company, the following would have to happen in a BIG, BIG, way!Truffles are a great start, along with Brand Building for RLH, but very easy to grow, genetics can be bought easily on line and Competitors would definitely go for market share if they see exponential revenues.Also, being a fungus, I could see possible challenges in exporting due to microbial standards that have to by Health Canada(microbial control is usually through irradiation or fumigation). The Legal frame is in the works but how many years is North America are we away 1,2 3...years, being in the Netherlands is a good start, but the sales there will provide some models of cash projections.I'm am curious about St. Vincents, and choosing them, I understand the Legal Frame work is relaxed, but most of the Larger Cannabis Companies that went to Jamaica have since pulled out due to Regulations of Exporting issues. I can see complications with exporting meeting FDA and Health Canada Regs, this is not a food export but Pharmaceutical with complex standards. If it is solely a cash move for the most bang, I would of worked domestically getting Scheduled Research and Testing License in Canada and do R and D and Manufacturing in Canada,(lots of excellent Labs and Researchers)As they expand into other Psychedelics, LSD, MDMA, DMT, Mescaline, Ayahuasca, the list goes on, not all, but a there are several that are indigenous to Canada and can be easily grown here(some already) for the Precursors. I believe again, Canada could be leaders in the Genetics, Cultivation, Processing, Synthesis and Purification of many Psychedelic Compounds.It still gets tougher and more complicated to validate the dosing, along with Clinical Studies since you will be administering a drug for treatment(this is not a food supplement of vitamin) You are making claims.The Leaders in this Industry will not be Hypers and how they can rant on about this article or this has helped, the proof will be in the investment into sound practices of Research and Development, Genetics, Agronomy, Processing, Clinical Studies and Marketing, proven results building the Company's IPs and Leaders, leadingThere are many Companies venturing into this space and I see only less than a 1/2 dozen that I believe in. Keep it up Red Light Holland, I believe you can make the List!"

"Just Sold Short 2500 shares of TRIP at $30.56 a little while ago. This is a Pure Earnings play, TRIP reports earnings just after 4:00 PM today, and I am expecting a very poor ER, to be followed by a significant drop in stock price, to around the $26 level. This stock is still over-valued, and needs a very good ER in order to justify even the current price. I do not see them delivering such an ER. Misses on Revenue and EPS consensus estimates should send this tumbling down, IMO. It is a risky play because the stock is volatile and there may still be some irrational exuberance in the market, that could give this a pop on positive guidance or hopes for the future. But, for me this is a very worthwhile gamble, the risk/reward ratio for an 8-12% downside move, is excellent. Of course I could be completely wrong, as I have recently been quite a lot. So, do your own research and make your own stock trading decisions, just as I do. :-) Best Wishes! :-)"

"Had a profitable day. Made some short trades on $MNMD and $HBOR. Grabbed $TRIP on the dip Malachi gave us ( thank u! ) and I even had some free paper left over to grab another dip tomorrow, thanks to my short position on $HBOR. $HBOR is guaranteed $ with a short. It’s literally the worst MJ company of the small caps. Volume is dry ( mostly shorts ) so you know it’s going further down. ROLL that profit into $TRIP $TRUFF. Shorting $HBOR is easier gains than any crypto/speculative stock. Good luck! GO TRIP!"

"$250M stock buyback will be removing 6% of outstanding shares in open market trading. Considering the majority of shares are held by institutions this should push shares available in the market to a higher level. The $3.50 special dividend per share will be payable on Dec 4th to shares on record Nov 20th. The stock will decline an equal amount as the dividend but will likely recover in a short time due to share buybacks. The current share price is near its' 5 year low. The company is a money machine and has NO DEBT and we will see continued growth in coming quarters. I would not be surprised to see management declare a monthly dividend declared next year.Great business, good management."
All shorts to file bankruptcy tomorrow as market will also be up?
A great report... thus is going to be a big winner the next 6 months

"My next Pure Earnings play is going to be a Short Sell of TRIP. Sometime tomorrow, after I close my NMIH Long play, I will use 95+% of my hard capital to Sell Short TRIP, ahead of her earnings release, to hold through the release. I think this play offers excellent risk/reward odds of an 8-12% profit on a sharp downturn in response to a poor ER. Here is my brief analysis:TRIP, Sell Short: Expecting a significant miss of consensus estimates on EPS, and likely also on Revenue. Very poor earnings history, they have missed on either EPS or Revenue 17 out of the past 20 ER's. Poor stock price reactions to ER's. Stock is still moderately over-valued. Negative media articles on company. Significant exposure to Coronavirus issue. Analysts bearish but still give good upside PT's. Some insider selling recently. Overall financials are good/very good. Company is laying off workers and instituting new policies to try to improve their bottom line. Why do this and announce this just before ER? I think it is because they know EPS and Revenue numbers will be very bad, and are looking to raise guidance and try to sound upbeat about the future, to prevent more decline in share price. My bet is that this strategy will fail, and the market will bring this down to the $26 level or lower. Note: All Pure Earnings plays are very dangerous. You can easily lose 10-30% of your capital on a single play in a single day. So, if you are not comfortable with such risk, you should not do Pure Earnings plays. Best Wishes! :-)"
Missed badly on both EPS and Revenue. This should easily drop below $17 tomorrow:Tripadvisor (TRIP) reported 1st Quarter March 2020 earnings of $0.07 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.17 per share
This website lolol trip has never ever made a profit..So.. let's open up a website call it Thinktrip..coGoIPO 2b..And never produce a profit..I understand real booking websites.TripAdvisor is based on a out of country experience..UmmmmmmmmmmmnnNo one on this planet wants to go out side their own country...Lolol..Wake up..Maybe we take road trips in summer..Maybe we take a daily trip..But no one on this planet is taking a tripThat needs advising...Jmo..Sell high here today..On abnb and trip. Etc.After coming to a fact..And I don't do coin tosses.Lmao.
TRIP is making $100 hundreds of dollars.
Let’s see. Global travel has stopped. TRIP is up today. Those buyers must have superpowers that are beyond me.
Google is ramping up its travel site and reviews are flooding in. TRIP may turn out to be MySpace in 5 years. I would not want to be in any business that competes directly with Google.

The way the stock opened up a buck plus on BIG volume...apparently someone heard something !What were the rumors on buyouts ?
"I am following this stock for a long time. From 12 major factors 10 fails and only 2 passes (2:10); revenue, EPS, ROE, analyst recommendations, PEG ratio, industry earnings, days to cover, insider trading, weighted alpha all falling and the stock only passing earning growth, earning forecast. All these factors show the stock is not healthy at all until company shows huge improvement in future earnings and the new partnerships. Unfortunately, the travel sector got tons of hit in the past 2 years because of the terrorist attacks around the world especially in Europe and people traveling less and booked hotel less in general. In addition, new travel ban regulations around the world including US made the situation worse for this sector. More specific for trip advisor, the recent competitions from new companies like airbnb cut huge side of revenue and now tripadvisor owns less part of the pie. Last but not least, tripadvisor counts on instant booking which still couldn't show significant effect on their stock and all these reasons causing to put this stock under too much pressure. I personally bought this stock because I believe tripadvisor has a very valuable data that gathered in the past few years from the users which is not considered in the stock price and put this company in a great position for bigger companies to buy out like what happened to linkedin, dreamworks and so on. If trip advisor cant rebound soon then there is big chance they sell the company to bigger players like expedia and great return of investment min 50% for the investors who put money down in their stock!"
"It is clear that TRIP will benefit from the reopening of vacation travel. We also know that this will result in YOY positive comps for several years. This long runway provides a great opportunity for significant P/E expansion, even without very strong earnings for 2021."
