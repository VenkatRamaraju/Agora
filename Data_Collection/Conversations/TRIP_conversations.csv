"$BUZZ and $TRIP, long and strong brothers and sisters!"
"Back to $19 next week, reality sets in"
"The only legal mushroom company that is able to sell truffles through their red light Holland brand in the Netherlands that is also a public listed company. Mushrooms the more people learn about it the more I think people will want to try for themselves , red light Holland wants to do recreational first then eventually one day dive into the medical side of things they are doing it in reverse compared to Canada’s rollout in the sense that Canada first started with medical cannabis then went recreational. $TRIP wants to do recreational first then dive into the medical biotech aspect of it.I can’t believe they got Russell peters to be the creative director of the company that is definitely trippy , I tripped out when I heard that news for $TRIP.CN"
I'm short 10k shares to 26.73
Game over until a buyer shows up

$TRIP Moved up 2 cents or 6.7% to close at 32 cents on over 1.59 million shares traded incl ATS. A pretty exciting day for a slow Monday in Canada when the US markets were closed for Memorial Day.$SPDR $CLSH $HBOR
33+ close today
"Expect a pop tomorrow, 5% to 7%"
psychedelics are in a bull market led by CMPSbut #TRIP is the only one that has shown a way to generate $$$ by actually sellling the stuff
"Great day! In at .29 this morning.Does this continue to grow tomorrow and going forward? Any thoughts on potential pullback? $TRIP.CNThis company has huge potential but also very volatile, wondering when I should start setting stop limits etc or chunking off profit. Does any one know how to see after hours market prices ?"

"Today, we will fight again! This is gonna be a very blessed and beautiful week guys! Good luck to all and God bless!! $TRIP to heaven!!!"
The way the stock opened up a buck plus on BIG volume...apparently someone heard something !What were the rumors on buyouts ?
Don’t buy shares now because Deutschland needs to dump at higher prices. None of the other important travel stocks are moving higher. Stocks like carnival and American Airlines haven’t gained a dime. There’s no recovery without them as a group.
Wasn't it expected that revenue would be lower given all the Boeing issues?
I told everyone LAST quarter (see my post below) that this was a disaster and you shouldn't believe all the pumping. Their statements (and sell side commentary) was literally not believable but as always....some people did. Last quarter stock should have been down 20% as I said....well at least not we are on the right track. If we were not in a bubble stock would be down 20%.
$trip entered Brazil. Hop in for a sweet ride
I heard about TRIP the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Guys check out RED LIGHT HOLLAND $TRIP it's a new one going to be a good one bruce linton and rusell peters joined the company they can legally sell truffle mushrooms in holland. check it out
Booking.com should just buy this for $62...use to be much higher than that!
"Jun 30, 2014 price was $108.66 and continued to drop since that time."
Buyout @$65 possible

"Shout out from Istanbul team $trip!!!! Todd is right there is no room for can't do in life, only can do and positivity. Just a little kid from Vancouver now I'm tripping all over the world !!! Let's get after it! Everything is possible if you want it to be bad enough, life truly is this way."
In a different market this stock could have been DOWN 20% after this terrible quarter. If it was trading at some ridiculously cheap multiple I could maybe see a bounce but it is already trading at 38X forward earnings according to Yahoo.
"Anyway, imitation & flattery, right? Keep your eyes on the prize folks...Mr. Musk is about to join $trip and propel us to the moon  "
"All travel websites stocks are crashing $EXPE, $TRIP, $BKNG in preparation for AirBnB IPO next year. AirBnB is verifying all room listings now and becoming a serious player in this space, and a lot of money will flow to its IPO."
"This company has everything, air B&B, Expedia and Bookings plus real guests pictures and comments, when you go across the world you want to know exactly what to expect, because this company hotel across the world treat you better, they don’t want bad reviews on Trip advisor, you can reserve table in any place and buy tickets to any attractions and concerts....they have lots of potential to be number 1,"
A great report... thus is going to be a big winner the next 6 months

"#NUMI has been doing well over the past 2 days, up approximately 15% since Monday's open.

"""Sales growth decelerated to just 4% in the 2018 fiscal year from 5% the year before.""""Its core hotel-booking business fell 3% last year compared to a 1% uptick in 2017. That segment has now dropped in two of the last three fiscal years, in fact.""Reduced Marketing saved the bottom line.""More importantly, TripAdvisor reduced marketing spending in the segment during the year, which, while hurting customer traffic, led to higher-quality leads for its partners and a more profitable business overall. The division logged a 24% spike in adjusted earnings so that its profit margin improved to 33% of sales from 26% a year earlier.""They are increasing spending to grow the non hotel side - this will pressure earnings going forward.""That spending will pressure profits in 2019, they warned, while giving TripAdvisor a more valuable position in a market that's predicted to reach $129 billion of total spending by 2020.""This is no longer a growth stock.....https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-important-trends-tripadvisor-apos-154600495.html"

"Anyone see $TRIP is up 18%, anyone know why? I still believe $NUMI is the top dog of them all."
Supposedly Terry booth from Aurora is a major shareholder of $TRIP but is also on the $BUZZ team I wonder what that could signify? Also $BUZZ own a major Eurozone distribution pharma license or something along those lines. I remember reading that somewhere.
exciting times with $TRUFF $TRIP
"So what’s the difference between $TRIP and $BUZZ, they seem to be affiliated￼? Should I buy $BUZZ shares instead due to a cheaper share price? Thanks"
"Adding more every day to to keep averaging out my 145k shares during this correction. Does anybody honestly see a future where mushrooms aren’t mainstream? It’s already being sold online in US and Canada. The government and big pharma will not not cash in on it. $TRIP.CN is going to the moon, but it’s not going to happen overnight. Diamond hands folks :)"
"I will be Selling Short TRIP just before market close today, as a Pure Earning play. This is a company in trouble and today's AH earnings report should cement this fact. The numbers will be bad and Guidance will also be bad. This should result in a significant price correction to around the $15 level tomorrow. TRIP is fully dependent upon people traveling. And I am not talking business travel but rather discretionary leisure travel. Anyone who thinks that people will be eager to take discretionary leisure trips anytime in 2020 is completely wrong. The Coronavirus casts a huge shadow over every aspect of the travel industry for the foreseeable future. A shadow dark enough to perhaps obliterate TRIP. TRIP is a company that will struggle to survive for the next few years. Given that fact it is way over-priced and this Short Sell offers an excellent risk/reward ratio."
Shrooms are popping again!!!MMED uplisting to nasdaq announced today!$MMED$TRIP$NUMI
"TRIP (at $27.60) is a solid 'buy'. It's the best run, fastest growing and best value of all the online travel-related companies right now... $40.00 stock by Feb 1st... BUY!!"
"$trip $truff all day, every day #redlightarmy"
"I can’t believe they got Russell peters to be the creative director of the company that is definitely trippy , I tripped out when I heard that news for $TRIP.CNLooks like vireo health fired Bruce Linton I think because he didn’t care for cannabis companies anymore and was more so supporting red light Holland then they got angry and let him go lol. Oh well that’s too bad for them. Like it or not Bruce has a lot of connections due to his past role of ceo of tweed. It’s hard to recreate the tweed legacy with vireo, there will only be one tweed not sure what vireo were thinking, however with red light Holland this reminds me of the beginnings of tweed, niche market something new, I think Bruce likes to lobby the government for change too so let’s see what happens and where that would bring us in the future but for now creating a strong brand in NL is a great idea."
My thinking is that the partnership between $TRIP & $BUZZ will strengthen. they are invested in one another & benefit from symbiotic growth; they're success is co-dependent in a way - no worries here; waiting for the Spike

There’s better choices out thereButDepending on your investment plan short/longLong would be any time Short would beThere’s better choices That’s my opinion You should contact an investment advisor
"$TRIP AND $BUZZ GUNNA BE A PARTY, buzz owns the stores trip is selling their products !"
"After 8 years, TRIP stock actually lost value. Not a very good buy and hold. There are many other stocks way better."
"I am following this stock for a long time. From 12 major factors 10 fails and only 2 passes (2:10); revenue, EPS, ROE, analyst recommendations, PEG ratio, industry earnings, days to cover, insider trading, weighted alpha all falling and the stock only passing earning growth, earning forecast. All these factors show the stock is not healthy at all until company shows huge improvement in future earnings and the new partnerships. Unfortunately, the travel sector got tons of hit in the past 2 years because of the terrorist attacks around the world especially in Europe and people traveling less and booked hotel less in general. In addition, new travel ban regulations around the world including US made the situation worse for this sector. More specific for trip advisor, the recent competitions from new companies like airbnb cut huge side of revenue and now tripadvisor owns less part of the pie. Last but not least, tripadvisor counts on instant booking which still couldn't show significant effect on their stock and all these reasons causing to put this stock under too much pressure. I personally bought this stock because I believe tripadvisor has a very valuable data that gathered in the past few years from the users which is not considered in the stock price and put this company in a great position for bigger companies to buy out like what happened to linkedin, dreamworks and so on. If trip advisor cant rebound soon then there is big chance they sell the company to bigger players like expedia and great return of investment min 50% for the investors who put money down in their stock!"
Missed badly on both EPS and Revenue. This should easily drop below $17 tomorrow:Tripadvisor (TRIP) reported 1st Quarter March 2020 earnings of $0.07 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.17 per share
shorts getting fried ....yay
earnings report nothing but a dream of future growth. Reported 6 cents a share when expected 14 cents. HMMMM...this is reflecting EXPE bad earnings report that was 50% under expected earnings
"What do the analysts know that buyers don't? According to them, this thing is in the nose-bleed seats."

RED LIGHT HOLLAND TO THE MOON! #TRIP
"Pre markets looking very strong. Full disclosure: I added more $TRIP at .34, $NM ( Novamind ) at $1.60, and $MMED at $2.99. These 3 will lead each of their fields respectively - and soon RLH will have a new path with the Mera Deal. I expect lots of green today. All 3 major index’s are very green."

"Planes are not flying, ships are not sailing, resorts are closed, beaches are closed, Las Vegas is shut down, so can someone explain to me, how is it that TRIP is up on Wednesday."
"Might this have been overblown? What’s the EPS on this stock? If it was just the earning missed, which is already in the rearview mirror, what’s the outlook is what I am interested in. The stock valuation is high but has the fundamentals changed before and after the results?Not sure if the travel business has in fact picked up or on the downward slope, can anyone share their objective views. I don’t mean to be disrespectful but no hypers or dumpers please."

"$250M stock buyback will be removing 6% of outstanding shares in open market trading. Considering the majority of shares are held by institutions this should push shares available in the market to a higher level. The $3.50 special dividend per share will be payable on Dec 4th to shares on record Nov 20th. The stock will decline an equal amount as the dividend but will likely recover in a short time due to share buybacks. The current share price is near its' 5 year low. The company is a money machine and has NO DEBT and we will see continued growth in coming quarters. I would not be surprised to see management declare a monthly dividend declared next year.Great business, good management."
Back to $40?
TRIP is up 6.20% to 37.83

Will the Mera deal close this week? What do you predict will be next for $TRIP? The Psychedelics Insights acquisition seems like a great logical step to close?

"Was looking for travel stocks a month or so ago and found this, It was a very good investment. I already doubled my money and this company will thrive during summer especially with more people going out. It had a very fast run up thats why it is down recently but it's just a correction."
$TRIP may go for a little rip in the am #redlightarmy
Merry Christmas $TRIP holders!All the best for 2021.
Anyone know how earnings look? I don't expect much given the covid.
"Travel is down, advertising is down, market is down, TRIP is up. Makes sense."
"I have serious doubts whether TripAdvisor is going to be solvent when all is said and done. I would optimistically expect that they have seen a 50% drop in revenue and likely will for the next 6 months. Looking at their cash flow statement, this would put them in a position to be absolutely hemorrhaging cash. It is pretty clear they need will need to take on substantial amounts of debt to continue operations. They currently have access to a 1.2B revolving credit line and no long term debt which helps. No one is sure exactly how long it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to end. Estimates tend to range from 6 months to a year. Given that, it's questionable whether Trip Advisor will be able to stay in business unless it is able to find additional lines of credit. I think there is still considerable downside from here. At a share price of $5-7 they would normally start to become an attractive acquisition target, but with the economic fallout still unclear, it's hard to know who exactly would be in a position to both want to own TRIP and able to complete the acquisition."
"Trip is the world’s largest travel app, you don’t book a trip without checking on trip .... better than booking, air b&b and Expedia....$100 stock"

"Had a profitable day. Made some short trades on $MNMD and $HBOR. Grabbed $TRIP on the dip Malachi gave us ( thank u! ) and I even had some free paper left over to grab another dip tomorrow, thanks to my short position on $HBOR. $HBOR is guaranteed $ with a short. It’s literally the worst MJ company of the small caps. Volume is dry ( mostly shorts ) so you know it’s going further down. ROLL that profit into $TRIP $TRUFF. Shorting $HBOR is easier gains than any crypto/speculative stock. Good luck! GO TRIP!"
Get this puppy trending. I fly $Trip !!!
sooooo Is this going back to 44?
Down 6% AH and already coming back as I type this. Don't worry if you are long.....management will spend the next 3 hours telling sell side analysts how great things really are and by tomorrow morning's conf call the stock will be in the green......
"Trip needs to merge with Trvg for its own survival, to grow hotel business and be more valuable to booking and Expedia. Perfect fit!"
"It is clear that TRIP will benefit from the reopening of vacation travel. We also know that this will result in YOY positive comps for several years. This long runway provides a great opportunity for significant P/E expansion, even without very strong earnings for 2021."

Did anyone do any research on Brad J Lamb at first I didn’t understand why it made sense to get a real estate mogul to join $Trip do you guys have any ideas why they would hire him? I’m trying to connect the dots why would they need a superstar real estate personality to join the team? What real estate aspect would play a role for trip? Hmmmm

"My next Pure Earnings play is going to be a Short Sell of TRIP. Sometime tomorrow, after I close my NMIH Long play, I will use 95+% of my hard capital to Sell Short TRIP, ahead of her earnings release, to hold through the release. I think this play offers excellent risk/reward odds of an 8-12% profit on a sharp downturn in response to a poor ER. Here is my brief analysis:TRIP, Sell Short: Expecting a significant miss of consensus estimates on EPS, and likely also on Revenue. Very poor earnings history, they have missed on either EPS or Revenue 17 out of the past 20 ER's. Poor stock price reactions to ER's. Stock is still moderately over-valued. Negative media articles on company. Significant exposure to Coronavirus issue. Analysts bearish but still give good upside PT's. Some insider selling recently. Overall financials are good/very good. Company is laying off workers and instituting new policies to try to improve their bottom line. Why do this and announce this just before ER? I think it is because they know EPS and Revenue numbers will be very bad, and are looking to raise guidance and try to sound upbeat about the future, to prevent more decline in share price. My bet is that this strategy will fail, and the market will bring this down to the $26 level or lower. Note: All Pure Earnings plays are very dangerous. You can easily lose 10-30% of your capital on a single play in a single day. So, if you are not comfortable with such risk, you should not do Pure Earnings plays. Best Wishes! :-)"
by christmas this will rally above 36+
What happened that turned this around today?CEO was on CNBC a few days ago and host was asking why they never deliver on any of their promises and/or new products. She was asking in reference to their new Plus product. He gave some babbling answer. But her question was correct. This company has been disappointing the Street for years now.
I am humbled and thrilled to be right!!!!TRIP WILL SET A NEW 52 WEEK LOW.M SOON. SELL!!!!!SHORT!!!!!

"You Guys are watching?!!!!! It will go down to below $30.50 by the end of the day. TRIP has no future. It's not a tech company, its not Amazon, its not Facebook, it had nothing to offer..... Look at the down-trending chart, look at the moving averages, look at the PE. The big player use pops like this to exit. I won't be surprised if by the end of tomorrow's trading, it will be down 5%.The charts speak for themselves....Let me know what you think friends."
"$TRIP.CN conversationI see from the posts there are a lot of anxious Investors, Followers and Bashers, for RLH to really take off and I believe they will, but for this to happen, many bridges will have to be built and roads crossed.If I had to do an analysis on this Company, the following would have to happen in a BIG, BIG, way!Truffles are a great start, along with Brand Building for RLH, but very easy to grow, genetics can be bought easily on line and Competitors would definitely go for market share if they see exponential revenues.Also, being a fungus, I could see possible challenges in exporting due to microbial standards that have to by Health Canada(microbial control is usually through irradiation or fumigation). The Legal frame is in the works but how many years is North America are we away 1,2 3...years, being in the Netherlands is a good start, but the sales there will provide some models of cash projections.I'm am curious about St. Vincents, and choosing them, I understand the Legal Frame work is relaxed, but most of the Larger Cannabis Companies that went to Jamaica have since pulled out due to Regulations of Exporting issues. I can see complications with exporting meeting FDA and Health Canada Regs, this is not a food export but Pharmaceutical with complex standards. If it is solely a cash move for the most bang, I would of worked domestically getting Scheduled Research and Testing License in Canada and do R and D and Manufacturing in Canada,(lots of excellent Labs and Researchers)As they expand into other Psychedelics, LSD, MDMA, DMT, Mescaline, Ayahuasca, the list goes on, not all, but a there are several that are indigenous to Canada and can be easily grown here(some already) for the Precursors. I believe again, Canada could be leaders in the Genetics, Cultivation, Processing, Synthesis and Purification of many Psychedelic Compounds.It still gets tougher and more complicated to validate the dosing, along with Clinical Studies since you will be administering a drug for treatment(this is not a food supplement of vitamin) You are making claims.The Leaders in this Industry will not be Hypers and how they can rant on about this article or this has helped, the proof will be in the investment into sound practices of Research and Development, Genetics, Agronomy, Processing, Clinical Studies and Marketing, proven results building the Company's IPs and Leaders, leadingThere are many Companies venturing into this space and I see only less than a 1/2 dozen that I believe in. Keep it up Red Light Holland, I believe you can make the List!"
"Mushrooms the more people learn about it the more I think people will want to try for themselves , red light Holland wants to do recreational first then eventually one day dive into the medical side of things they are doing it in reverse compared to Canada’s rollout in the sense that Canada first started with medical cannabis then went recreational. $TRIP wants to do recreational first then dive into the medical biotech aspect of it."
Fill the gap
"$TRIP Red Light Holland Corp closed the day up 1 cent or 3.2% to finish on its high of 32.5 cents on 2.67 million shares. Great volume considering the daily average is 1.47 million. This one has been slowly going back up under the radar.I can feel the shorts starting to squirm. Shorts recently went up by 696,000 shares and TRIP is still moving up. That means they shorted when the SP was lower.If we keep going up tomorrow, shorts will be chasing the stock again."
$TRIP New Mushroom Stock !!! Going to be a good one
"$TRIP family, if you have ever believed in something strong and real - then hold til the dollar not to the pennies!!!!HOLD!!!!"

This thing loose money every week! Lots of losses...where is the growth?
"TRIP management needs to better advertise that they are an alternative to AirBB and VRBO, both of which have horrible customer service."

Eliza you are a smart trader. I have shorted 3000 shares after hours!
"At Tripadvisor, a filing with the SEC revealed that on Thursday, CEO Stephen Kaufer purchased 44,444 shares of TRIP, for a cost of $21.73 each, for a total investment of $965,768. Investors have the opportunity to snag TRIP even cheaper than Kaufer did, with the stock changing hands as low as $20.21 in trading on Monday which is 7.0% below Kaufer's purchase price."
Non hotel is growing amazingly fast... Good time to buy here down a bit
Good morning all.... over $20 million....selling iMicrodose packs....and building future growth.Have a great day :)$TRIP
Priceline showed much better earing and down -5.61% ...........think
I find it interesting how they disappoint on earnings and the very next day Piper Jaffray maintains their neutral rating but raises their price target - very interesting indeed.Maybe they need to hold the price levels while they dump. Hmmm
"After waking up to the insurmountable amount of chat regarding MindMed’s CEO JR selling off many millions worth of shares this past week ( he let go about 30% months back - which led to public outcry - and recently another 36% +/- ) I have to say with the intimate confidence, I am MORE than proud to be heavily invested into Red Light Holland - where no shareholder has sold a single share or exercised an option. Insiders at RLH do not appear to be using their share positions as a personal piggy bank. Whatever JR had to do with his money to get where he is today, clearly was not sensible. People who are smart with money, no not do what JR is doing. Be PROUD you have management with $TRIP that isn’t dumping shares. I mean, it’s hard to dump shares when your stock is UNDER valued - it’s very easy to dump shares like JR did when your stock is OVER valued. Yes, Mindmed is over valued. There is zero revenue to justify the share price. I could not be more proud to support RLH. I know you see this Todd! Thank you!"
"Curtis wake up, this is great news , huge buy back as well ......BUY"
