"Pre markets looking very strong. Full disclosure: I added more $TRIP at .34, $NM ( Novamind ) at $1.60, and $MMED at $2.99. These 3 will lead each of their fields respectively - and soon RLH will have a new path with the Mera Deal. I expect lots of green today. All 3 major index’s are very green."
Merry Christmas $TRIP holders!All the best for 2021.
"After waking up to the insurmountable amount of chat regarding MindMed’s CEO JR selling off many millions worth of shares this past week ( he let go about 30% months back - which led to public outcry - and recently another 36% +/- ) I have to say with the intimate confidence, I am MORE than proud to be heavily invested into Red Light Holland - where no shareholder has sold a single share or exercised an option. Insiders at RLH do not appear to be using their share positions as a personal piggy bank. Whatever JR had to do with his money to get where he is today, clearly was not sensible. People who are smart with money, no not do what JR is doing. Be PROUD you have management with $TRIP that isn’t dumping shares. I mean, it’s hard to dump shares when your stock is UNDER valued - it’s very easy to dump shares like JR did when your stock is OVER valued. Yes, Mindmed is over valued. There is zero revenue to justify the share price. I could not be more proud to support RLH. I know you see this Todd! Thank you!"
"Adding more every day to to keep averaging out my 145k shares during this correction. Does anybody honestly see a future where mushrooms aren’t mainstream? It’s already being sold online in US and Canada. The government and big pharma will not not cash in on it. $TRIP.CN is going to the moon, but it’s not going to happen overnight. Diamond hands folks :)"
"Jun 30, 2014 price was $108.66 and continued to drop since that time."
"Anyway, imitation & flattery, right? Keep your eyes on the prize folks...Mr. Musk is about to join $trip and propel us to the moon  "
"$TRIP Red Light Holland Corp had an excellent week trading well over 2 million shares a day with 3.7 million shares traded incl ATS on Friday. For the week, the SP rose 4.5 cents or 14.2% to close at 36 cents. #PSILOCYBIN #BUY"
I heard about TRIP the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"""I apologize in advance for tagging multiple tickers in this post, however, this is important information that concerns shareholders in every company mentioned.There’s an active IIROC investigation into what appears to be predatory naked shorting algorithm that is run through CIBC (079) house, targeting countless CSE/TSX(V) stocks.The original series of complaints were submitted to IIROC by $XRX shareholders after it became apparent that CIBC (079) house was systematically layering bids/asks and using small orders to downtick the price on low volume. When volume would come in, they would cap the price until buyers were exhausted and then resume low volume selling in small lots with bigger buys below (likely covering short positions).It is fair to ask whether it could be a legit paper holder liquidating position but the volume vs tradable float ratio and the way the trades were executed point towards likely naked shorting algo.I’ve noticed exact same activity by CIBC (079) on numerous other tickers in the past: $CODE $DIGI $FORT $INTL $TRIP, to name a few. There must've been at least 20+ others where I saw this happen. Some stocks managed to recover but most were hammered until buyers were exhausted and they are now stuck trading within lower support ranges.Today, the same algo was targeting $VERY as it was pushed below $2.00. You can check the fresh trading data on that ticker, so you know what to look for."
"$BUZZ and $TRIP, long and strong brothers and sisters!"

"Nice to see Walter here. But, wrong stock kiddo. This is far out your control or area of expertise. Stick to ruining the $HUGE board lolWhen TRIP IPO’d Walter got on all of his accounts and littered the $TRIP board for about 4-5 days steady until his comments just sort of drifted with the wind LOL"
"Today $TRIP ""Red Light Holland Corp"" traded 3.77 million shares at an average SP of 36.12 cents to close up 1.4% to finish at 36.5 cents. Investors seem confident that $TRIP will see 40 cents before the end of the week."
Back to $40?
"Was looking for travel stocks a month or so ago and found this, It was a very good investment. I already doubled my money and this company will thrive during summer especially with more people going out. It had a very fast run up thats why it is down recently but it's just a correction."
