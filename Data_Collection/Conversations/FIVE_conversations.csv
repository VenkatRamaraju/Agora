"And down she goes again, lol. And this I only the beginning. 56 by next March just like I predicted"
terrible q3 guidance. Diluted income per common share is expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.30
Well 128 isn’t 136.... but if you bought in 2015 and your average is $35 do you really care short term?
bounce tomorrow
in at 192

I have been waiting for a dip to get in. Down $22 may be my chance lol. With the shorten holiday season most retailers are going to miss.
I saw yesterday they announced the buildout starting of the new AZ DC they had delayed in March. I guess the market sees that as a positive in that they wouldn’t plan on spending the $75m unless sales were improving and they had the money. California and TX are reclosing malls but allowing shopping centers with outdoor entrances remain open. Hopefully they’ll avoid another round of closures.
$85 by year end or sooner ? Thumbs up or down. I will not comment on the poll
Five Below Price Target Cut to $115.00/Share From $125.00 by Credit Suisse
Five Below reports after the bell. It's best earnings season is upon us now and Q4 (after Christmas) will most likely be spectacular. Does anyone on this message board have an opinion/prediction as to where the share price might go after the bell?
Why the big drop today?
This Stock is highly undervalued.
i sold at 110 and change and it is not one im buying back given the tarriffs
Heading to Vegas tomoro to celebrate
"Can’t seem to find Bean anywhere? Wonder what happened to his Jan 5th call of “short this, going to $100” back when it was $167? How’d his “short this with everything you’ve got” prediction work out from Feb 2 when it was $174….. lol he sure got schooled."
I'm up $55 bucks since shorting the day I got out of the can

"Too cheap, as valuation looks high but it is worth it based on reliability , strong growth of revenues and profit. A model that is proven with an incredible ROI on new stores based on a real estate strategy that so far has proved flawless and zero debt. Any reference to Zainy Brainy is poorly advised and provides questions about the writer's motivation. There has been some portfolio balancing and perhaps new short positions put in place. The new shorts will be forced to cover very soon."
"Goodness I bought between 177 and 168 and it goes back to 185 in two days!? Lol. Like I’ve said for six years, buy when the pe gets close to 36"
"1) USFD has $FIVE BILLION of Debt and a market cap of $4 Billion, sales have collapsed and they will BURN huge amounts of cash. 2) UNFI has $3 Billion of Debt and a market cap of $450 million. sales are surging, and they are minting money.Most Investors are BACKWARD looking... they think that everything will return to the exact same conditions as before... = WHY most investors LOSE big time, by owning the OLD winners, and NOT owning the NEW ones."
"Anyone know the reason for the big dip today? I really like this stock and see a ton of growth, I hope I am right."
"Imagine if someone went long at $167 instead of shorting at that price? lol instead of being destroyed these last 7 months, they’d be up 40%! But nope… they shorted at 167… lol that’s funny, told ya."
"Five Below expenses where very high, and expected to increase. Wage inflation is really hurting these dollar stores. I love Five Below long term, yet will wait, I believe we will see $75 in the very near future."
"Check out the share losses and horrid incremental margins in 2019 - especially in the holiday quarter. The print this week reflects aggressive store openings vs other retailers plus stimulus. When, not if, these two catalysts disappear, this model will be exposed again as excellently positioned for 1965 but horribly positioned for 2021 and beyond?"
BEAN IS STILL ON HIS ROLLLLLLLL..... FACT. 100% OF THE TIME HE OPENS HIS PIE HOLE WITH IN 48HOURS OF TRADING TIME FIVE IS UP 10+ POINTS.... HE'S A FINANCIAL GENIUS.
"Five Below reports earnings on August 28 (next week). Lowes and Target rocked up today, as they posted incredible earnings. Five Below will do the same again next Wednesday. I had visited a Five Below store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan a few weeks ago. It is located downstairs from street level. The store was packed with customers. I spoke with a few employees to get a sense of what business is like. They told me the place has been extremely busy since the day they opened last year. They had a about 5 employees working the cash registers as the line-up's never stopped. As I walked around the store, I was very impressed by the diversification of items for sale. My wife purchased to very nice 'New York City' t-shirts for $5.00 each, the same quality tshirt you would pay $25 for at another store. My friends have also visited Five Below stores in other states with their children and they loved the stores and all were very busy. One final note, the day the tariffs are lifted, this stock will jump $25 in one day. As for now, accumulate, accumulate in a big way. Five Below will be $135 next Wednesday.Don't miss the boat, get on board."

new highs today
My Ameritrade acct. shows that Five is 95% institutionally owned and they are not trading. That leaves a small float of shares to buy. They are expanding rapidly to be the first ones in this $5 and under market. Now Bank of America and J.P. Morgan are rating this stock as it climbs from a $7billion dollar market cap to triple that if their end game is 2500 stores. It is also a recession proof business. Go Five!
Ya 45 times earnings seems about right for a brick and mortar retailer growing sales mid teens.Unfortunately I really don't understand things like valuation. I like charts.

"Whether we want to admit it or not, the trade war is going to land punches on retail. Discount stores ($FIVE $TJX $GO $OLLI $DLTR $DG) can thrive in environments like this. Wholesale like $COST will likely be fine as well. You're rolling the dice on anything else though."
I bought 6 shares of five @114.9
Everything is going down and a bit up but Five keeps moving forward. It’s relative strength against the index continues to benefit us shareholders.
$177-$179 next stop
I just wanna thank all my fans and well wishers for the outpouring of support today. We did it!
Timberrrr see ya 180s
"Big volume today (much higher than average). Looks as though the run up towards earnings (March 27) has started. Having followed Five Below now for 4 years, it should easily make a new all time high on March 27. There will be announcements of how many more stores they have opened, including how many more they plan for next quarter. Based on eps growth, the share price (p/e) should be approx. $150 by Oct. 2019....this is being conservative, which I like to be. Any pullback below $116 is a strong buy. My guess is they have approx. My guess is their store count will be close to 900 by the end of this year."
Fair value is 58.33. These store are not worth over a million a piece. I will update mid weeks. Thank you for all the accolades!
No reason to throw in “without virus we’d be tracking to expectations “. This is an insecure management team. They say what they think the market wants to hear
Long term fine Short term may see more down side. Been in since the drop last year. Love this company. Wait till 10 belows start coming up.bThis store will replace dollar stores.
"The earnings news must be leaking.I will let you know when I sold the shares I bought last March at $72.55...I mean $49-$55,, um, no sorry $58.. after the earnings release. Cusz no one trades virtual shares better than me!"
"Timberrrr, raining cash!"
"if u plan to short five at 80 you best be prepared to rebuy in 4 , mnths"
"So if they could replicate their q2&3 performance for q4,1,2 they could be at about $3.85 to $4.05 eps by august ‘21. Historically the PE since 2012 averages about 40-45x1 which puts the share price at $154-182 by September. But they do occasionally run hot with pe’s at 50 or 55x1 at some points in the last 8yrs. If they put up a good q2 they could run hot going into holiday 2021. A 50-55x1 pe could put them at $200-$222 by early sept 2021. That’s a lot to go right in the next 9mo but if they get to $205ish in sept I’m gonna sell 5-7,000 shares and buy a condo on Marco island."
Like I said this is KMART.
Bought in today. Couldn't pass up a bargain.
"Ya, as I’m reading the 10k the weak q3 guidance makes more sense now. They’re projected to open stores in q3 that should have been opened in q2 (construction delays) and they’re really ramping up inventory in q3. Looks like they’re trying to get ahead of the shipping delays to get holiday Merch into stores early. It all makes sense now and could set them up for a good q4 but I’d not expect to see a measurable price increase until they announce holiday sales at n early January. Either way I can’t sell anymore shares this year because of capital gains limits, my goal is to harvest profits by selling 2k shares a year every March until 2026 then just hold the remaining shares to see what happens."
this company at this moment is the best buy in the brick and mortar space.
"Sorry for my recent inactivity as we've been rehearsing for our upcoming tour w David Lee Roth. We've done more rehearsal in the last 2 weeks than we've done in the last 5 years. So here we go, big couple weeks! Let's start with Reta. I released this as a buy at 88, we are now at 104 in only 2 weeks. Aapl with blowout earnings, a 900 billion buy back and raising the dividend! Slb, up 8% in only 2 weeks since I released it as a buy! Five continues to trickle down, along with my other short, Ge. So here are a few new releases! Buy aal, acad and wmt. Short five, Ge and roku! Will update end of week and congrats everyone!"
"Folks a few comments from WS article below, also something not mentioned in article but announced by the company is they will open 2,400 stores in the next 2 years. Growth rate will sky rocket.Below pasted...Many retailers are closing stores. Five Below Inc. FIVE -3.04% can’t seem to open them fast enough.A study last year by KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. found that a basket of 67 items was 52.6% less expensive at Five Below than on Amazon.com.“No retailer is truly Amazon-proof, but they are in a better position than most,” said Bradley Thomas, a KeyBanc managing director of equity research. “You will save money if you shop at Five Below rather than on Amazon. Most retailers can’t say that.”The chain, which sells everything from Spalding basketballs to Bluetooth headphones and yoga mats for $5 or less, might be the most successful retailer you’ve never heard of.By the end of this year, Five Below’s store count will have nearly quadrupled to 750 locations since its 2012 initial public offering, with its latest location opening Friday in Manhattan—the chain’s first in the New York City borough.All that growth hasn’t cannibalized existing locations, which have posted sales increases in all but one of Five Below’s 25 quarters as a public company. Total sales over that period have nearly tripled to $1.28 billion. Profits are up roughly sixfold, and its stock has climbed 608% to $120.31 through Thursday’s close since the IPO.Five Below uses a formula that has largely insulated it from competition from Amazon.com Inc. The chain keeps prices low by creating products from scratch with hundreds of suppliers around the world and sells them in an environment where children want to hang out. Its own e-commerce sales are so negligible the company doesn’t break them out; shipping often costs more than the entire purchase.“Online is great when you know what you want,” Five Below Chief Executive Joel Anderson said. “When you walk into one of our stores, you will discover things you didn’t know you wanted. It’s like a treasure hunt. We’re the T.J. Maxx for kids.”"
The silence is deafening
"BEAN BEAN BEAN ALL IS GREAT.. EARNINGS MORE THAN DOUBLED!!!!!! YOU SAID THE STOCK WOULD BE BELOW $50.00 THIS MONTH..,BWHAHAHAHAHAHA ONCE THE SMALL REV MISS IS DIGESTED CORRECTLY THIS PUPPY WILL BE OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN HEADED TOWARD NORTH OF $250.00 FACT!!! TIME TO BACK THE TRUCK UP AND LOAD UP!!!!!"
Let’s say 1000 stores with a market cap of close to $5 billion = $5 million a leased store selling candy / phone covers etc . Where are most of there products made ?
"Exactly what I predicted, for the stock to go up Monday they needed to report an increase in 2018 earnings guidance and they didn’t, so the stock will pull back quite a bit this week. Should at least pull back to 110. Lulu raised guidance and they’ll be up 3% today."
guess what i am about to short?
timberrrr
"Today’s $177 closing price puts them at around a 38x1 PE. That’s not great but it’s good. Their historical pe going back to ipo in 2012 is about 46x1. (Because of their rapid growth) I’ve always said it’s a good buy if the pe is between 36-40 and buy every single share you can if the pe goes below 36. I’ve taken my own advice and since my first purchase in January 2014 I’ve accumulated well over 15,000 shares with an average below $40. I nibble a little today at 178 and I’ll buy a few hundred more here or there over the next few days. I guarantee you 101% this will get back to $225. Maybe by March? maybe by end of 2022? Maybe not till 2023? (Doubt it will be that long) the concept is a hit, it will be back to $235 at some point in its future and I guarantee $275 by 2024. They’ll EASLY be at $7.50 a share by end of 2024!"
"The trend line for this stock going back to ipo in 2012 is and always has been trading between a 40-45x1 ttm pe. That is a fair price because at 30+% eps growth annually its growing three times faster than the overall market at a15x1 pe. Right here today, with 2.66 in earnings last year a fair price should be between $107 and 120 with the mean being $113 right now today. IF they can meet the top end of their 2019 estimates at 3.07 a fair price by year end would be $135 BUT five is usually conservative with estimates so if they can (and usually do) beat estimates I think they can get to $145 by end of December. People need to be realistic this won’t sell for 200 this year unless people start way over paying, which they’ll later regret. When it was 136 in sept I told you that was to high to buy, and three months later you could have bought in low 90s. If you’re long this stock just be patient, you shouldn’t look to sell until summer 2021 at minimum. But 2022 to early 2023 would be better to exit your position (assuming a shallow recession between now and then). Be patient. $225+ by spring 2022."
Will this stock ever reach 200 again any time soon????
"This pullback from the mid $120s hurts but I’m glad to see it. They need to retest the October lows of $110 to move up so touching $112,113,114 is necessary long term to get a breakout to over 140. I’m glad to see they won’t report earnings until first week of December. If they report a beat and raise on Dec 6th for q3 they’d already be a full 36 days into the quarter and would by then have a good sense of what holiday sales look like. And the added benefit is that this year 2018 is the longest period of shopping days between thanksgiving and Christmas, there are a full 33 days between the holidays which only happens every six years. If five could touch $113-114ish by Wednesday it could be a really good setup for a run through end of March into 140-150! (Maybe 160?) Of course if they hold but don’t raise guidance in two weeks this probably doesn’t bode well and won’t break 130 by March"
Comps down 12% year over year. Good thing they added brick and mortar stores. AMZN must be jealous.This AH pop off the earnings beat will be the high. Short any strength tomorrow.
"Personally I believe that this standout brick and mortar retailer is very undervalued at just 39 times this year's earnings. If I didn't short GME at $4 last year, I would buy more here. Thank god I still have 160 shares."
"Bob,I am extremely Bullish on Five it is in our 3 top investments. Recently sold Olli and it was definitely sold too early but the money was used to feed better growth stocks at the time. I admit freely I could have sold some other stocks in retrospect. I just finished a re-evaluation of going back into Olli but it is too pricey at the moment based on the growth metrics I use. I might sell some puts though after I review some premiums and time value. I like the company but it less efficient than Five on several levels compared to FIVE in my opinion.Sales growth being the chief issue as Five is growing faster ( 29% vs.18 % at OLLI ) and has no long term debt vs, some LTD at OLLI but by no means daunting)Relative Timing is an excellent 1.65 vs. a good 1.33.MACD is negative at Olli vs a Positive reading at FIVE.Now for the Dollar Stores. I must say they are all excellent companies and more mature than FIVE and that is why I choose FIVE, DG is only growing sales at 3 % but again not 29 %. Five out grows both in EPS but frankly it should and must to maintain the PE. DLTR is growing sales at 6% not bad but not as good. When I compared them I think DG and DLTR are trading at where they should be and OLLI a little heavy but they are all good companies and a BUY rated, The problem with your analysis it weights the history fine but has no forecast usage IMO.The comments about the Founder are well known but it looks like he learned a lot from that experience and his hands on early build of FIVE. He recruited a very Fine Executive team and Anderson has more than answered the old and dated challenges made by Kerrisdale who I wonder with their over all lack of success even exist today. I believe any future shorts will lose money so long as the 20/20/20 strategic plan results prevail. My long term target remains $100. In my opinion after many back tests and actual key investment results is that find young growth companies and grow with them. I am a Trend and Value investor and the dynamics while different both yield above S&P results.In summary I should again acknowledge these are all very good companies and if you would have bought them 1 year ago to the day Five grew 76.8% , DLTR grew at 37,3 %, DG grew at 27.7 % and OLLI was 76.9%. So now you understand why I said I sold too early.."
This is one of the best companies to own. Ive been holding it for over 5 years and Ive had buys in the 30's.Its amazing they continue to deliver Qtr after Qtr in a deliberate way like they do whatever they want basically. They want to grow store count by 20% every year then that is exactly what they do all while not taking debt on. Phenomenal company with management and everyone should be holding this long term. The people who think they can trade this will lose and wish they just bought and held
new high
Looks like volume and share price are increasing as we approach 4:00 p.m......a good sign?
Five Below is down 4.95% to 224.52
"Any news, I don't see any???"
This is only the beginning
"Due to my successful stock pick, many have asked for my Super Bowl picks. Well, I am going to oblige. Here it is.....take Kc -3. Easy W, n thanks again for the accolades!"
She’s comin down
"Realistically it’s a really good entry in low 70s, could it go to high 60s? Ya, but at 74 it’s a 24x1 pe this year which is well below average for a growth retailer. Even if we move into recession and they pull back to just 10-15% new stores this year and their eps growth goes flat this year. They can easily get to $5-6 eps by 2024-2025. Just a 30pe at $5-6 puts them at 150-180 in 4-5yrs and all that is conservative. I think we’ll see a double bottom in the next two months so no rush, but dang, even if you buy at 75 and it goes to 68 would that really bother you if you sell at 180 in 5yrs?"
Beginning Feb. 14 the tariff reduction with China begins. This should provide a pop in the stock price.
Don't listen to the shorts. Paid flunkiare' who is trying to steal your shares. This is a great progressive company and will increase its share price. Dont sell.
Holding up very well in a down market = earnings bonanza and pushing shares over $200 easily after hours. Added the calls as this is a telltale sign of what's to come.
"I Am Back! After 60 days in county for a couple dui's n assault, I just wanna thank everybody for the outpouring of support. I will try and respond to everyone's messages sometime this week. I am glad I liquidated before going in the can. I will be putting the whole kit and kaboodle on this easy short. This may be the easiest short in the last 100 years. My short alone will drop it 2 bucks tomoro morning. Thank you for all the well wishes I will report in later this week. Ty!"
"Will Big Lots be a good litmus test for Five Below, BIG reports tomorrow. Looking for a trading play for earnings next week, Longs let me know what you expect out of FIVE next week? Thanks!"
perfect bullish engulfing
"They report holiday sales on Monday. I always used target and dollar tree results as a good Proxy as target is the exact same demographic and dollar tree is a very similar segment. Today targets comps were great, but they were hurt by increased SG & A for their DTC business. five should not have the same DTCSGA headwinds so they may report a very good number Monday morning. However, I think to see a real jump in the stock they will have to increase guidance for the fiscal year. Monday could be really good maybe breaking 125, or could drop back to 115 if they don’t report at least a penny increase in guidance. Could someone please call Joel and ask him to please increase guidance by at least a penny on Monday?"
"YA I coulda sold at $236 a week ago, but no biggie. I know retail, and the future of retail is brick and mortar.Besides just because other dollar stores like Dollartree warned about higher costs, didn't mean it would happen to FIVE, right?"
I backed up the truck. Thanks for the cheap shares.
"Way to go JP Morgan, these guys know a growth stock when the see one!! $150 price target!!"
why is it going red?
"This is setting up for a fall after earnings, you don’t go from a 39pe to a 43pe in two days unless they massively beat earnings and guide much higher Wednesday. This is a good stock but expensive at a pe above 40 and I doubt they can earn enough to reset the pe below 40 at earnings. Hey good for them if they can but I’m skeptical this massive two day run could hold through Thursday’s close."
"HUGE UPGRADE TO $295.00 WEDNESDAY! I BELIEVE THISIS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR FIVE THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WHICH I WILL TAKE ALL DAY LONG AND TWICW ON SUNDAY!!! Montani has a $295 bull case price target for the company, where Five Below would ride a pandemic reopening wave ""with a multichannel kicker."""
"We are seeing this stock's potential for a major breakout . It is pushing 80 with a strong chart. No debt , huge growth and Allen is whining . I am winning. Great management team. ,"
Lol STILL 600% higher than what I paid for it!
"Earnings this afternoon will be spectacular, as the Christmas retail was the best it has been in years. Going forward, Toy's R US is closing all it's stores, which means much more business for FIVE. Five Below should easily exceed $74 tomorrow. With the roll out of another 150 stores in 2018, this stock is going to the moon. Buy on any dip today, you will be handsomely rewarded over the next few days."
"I believe this is the best retail stock out there, stores are economical to open and pay for themselves in less than a year. 95% institutionally owned, no debt and I don't believe they serve food so worries about spoilage. I think we see $150 by next earnings report."
"Barclays makes no sense. Downgrades, but raises price target. SMH."
"Five is in great position, even if tomorrow earning report not above analysts estimate, the future is great for FIVE, high volume of sales fromkids for last few years their estimate stock price $230- $300 ( mid price $265 )But the future is what count"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Under $60 in few min
PE Ratio (TTM) 53.83
Good company no doubt but they have problems to deal with. First off Chinese products are going way up. Containers are costing ten times what they were. Everything in their wheelhouse is way up. Plus they were starting employees out at $11 an hour. That has either gone up or will have to. They can’t find workers. They can’t pass on most of this to the customers because it has to be $5 below. Like dollar tree. I am waiting for it to go up a little more and then will be buying puts for earnings and January.
"I did not like the lower end of the guidance Five Below stated yesterday. With tariffs expected to increase again on Dec. 15, I think Five Below will have more margin compression. 42 P/E is a lofty right now, so I think the bump up in share price is temporary. Yes, I am a big fan of Five Below, yet, from what I heard from the conference call, I am now slightly bearish/neutral. These tariffs are not good for all dollar stores.thoughts?"
"How's everyone doing tonight. Congrats to all my followers, as I said....this is only the very beginning! Bean s getting the job done as usual!"
Hello 182. The silence is all of a sudden deafening
Out at $63.85. On to PLAY.
"Still hold all my shares for FIVE from last year April.They are expanding all over the place.FIVE will soon replace the dirty old Dollar stores and such. They do offer cheap products, but great for kids and gifts."
Time to buy?
"Explain to me why some companies get a pass on earnings? All of a sudden for FIVE, it depends on future guidance and not the horrendous quarter they are about to report today. This seems to vary among stocks, never understood it. i.e. Macy's actually seemed like had all good news today and down 10%...."
"Like I said, there will be no trade deal in 2019... and the only way a trade deal gets done in 2020 is if the administration capitulates, drops most of their demands on ip transfers and China writing it into law. China’s going to delay and obfuscate until after the election so expect retail stock to be generally weak until 2021. Five is a good stock but you won’t see it break up until after 2020. Expect 2021 price action to be a lot like 2018."
And the collapse continues after hours. Anyone hear any news. More closings? Remeber don't be happy with a 15 percent gain. This is the easiest short in the last 12-14 years.
The biggest problem with owning five below is all those taxes you have to pay on the capital gains. If you owned sears or penny’s stock you wouldn’t have to worry about capital gains all.
"sorry, I bought more the other day. every time I buy a stock it goes down"
"Five Below has been consolidating nicely over the last few months. We should note that there are only 54 million shares with zero debt. Five Below will be well over $100/share by year end. Next weeks earnings release on June 6 will set the table for an incredible year ahead. The best 6 months are now in front of us, so upwards and onwards.Time to load the truck on shares."
"So can we count on this 3% pop hold, or even gain after opening tomorrow? or will it be sold off?"
"Five below? Oh no, $26.25 below! :)"
The miss that made this low price available was in reality small and even exaggerated by their success. There is not another bricks and mortar retailer that can and will deliver the growth that Five will deliver. Short term target 210 by year end. $250 by year end 2022.
I am a firm believer that all brick and mortar retailers that sell junk to preteens deserve a 45 P/E multiple.Who cares if the S&P trades at only 22 P/E? Therefore the $5.15 share will bring a $231 stock soon. I'm sure Mylora is thinking the same thing!
Bean let me give you an advice. Today is Options Expiration ( Now go look at open interest in the puts & calls)Notice how there are no open interest on the call side but hundreds & thousands on the put side. If you think the market makers are going to let put buyers cash out on all that money then you are new to this...
And this is only the beginning! Fair value 56.12
EARNINGS TODAY AND THEY ARE VERY GOOD. The outlook should be very interesting. Anderson and his team deseve strong bonus checks this year.
I think FIVE hit all time high today because I took my $600 stimulus check and used all of it to buy $600 worth of candy at my local Five Below. About 30% of the store square footage is compromised of aisles of candy. What an amazing concept.
been watching this stock for ages.... and just bought in. happy to be part of the FIVE family!
"Five Below will have spectacular earnings today after the bell. Toys ""R"" Us went bankrupt in Sept. 2017.....so all those thousands of customers all flocking to Five Below.........Five Below should open up around $76 tomorrow and easily touch $80.....with strong guidance, the table has been set....for the rest of the year......$90 by Sept. Now the best six months are ahead of us.......'All Aboard"".The train has officially left the $70 station, get on board, the next stop will be the $75 station. So, as the train conductor comes on the speak, "" Welcome aboard the Five Below Train, sit back and relax, cocktails and caviar will be served shortly""."
Hello 191!
Going back to 125 this week.
"They have very high expectations for this Q it seems, they put in EPS of 0.23c last Q, and now they are projecting 1.50 or so?"
"Expectations are for EPS of $1.58 on revenue of $602 million. I'm going to cross my fingers, & hope for EPS of $1.70 on revenue of 635 million."
"So IF (and it’s still an if) they can bring in q3 flat to LY at about .35eps that leaves them at a $4.59 eps going into q4. Now, it looks like q3 will be flat in part because they’ve got new stores in q4 to pay for and bringing in holiday inventiry early to avoid port delays. So IF they can stay flat into q4 all they need is a 19%eps growth for just q4. If they can grow q4 from 2.20 to 2.61, which shouldn’t be to difficult, they will earn $5 a share this year. If they can earn $5 expect a share price of $225 in March. With a range of 40x1 to 50x1 that’s a price range of $200-$250. Then if they can just grow earnings 15% in 2022 that puts earnings at $5.75 and a price range of $230-287. None of this is a guarantee but 15-18% eps growth is conservative for a retailer gaining economy of scale and opening 18% new stores yoy."
awesome earnings beats by three cents and stock up 22 percent only in America
i dont understand why anyone would short a stock like this. sure it will have small pull backs here and there but there are so many other stocks that make sense to short than a growth stock like this with such a clean balance sheet
"DON'T SELL AT THIS RIDICULOUS LOW PRICE. THIS IS WHAT MATTERS FROM FROM EARNINGS CALL BVELOW..""Net sales for Q3 are expected to be in the range of $550M to $565M, above consensus of $549M. EPS are expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.30 vs. consensus of $0.27""!!"
I play this stock like a fiddle
"Meh, right now between 108 and 121 is reasonable. It’s consistently traded between a 40-45 ttm pe since 2014 Sometimes it gets below that, maybe a 35x1 or a little lower, maybe on a rare occasion down to a 30x1 pe, and sometimes it goes as high as a 50x1 ttm pe, but it ALWAYS returns to a 40-45 ttm peSure some people think ftm pe is a better measurement, but of course ftm pe is not in the books fact, it’s assumption, so like I’ve said for five years. Don’t buy if it’s over a 45 pe, Buy when it’s below a 40x1 ttm, if it drops below a 35 ttm Buy all you can. Today with earnings at 2.64 the ttm is 43x1. People try to challenge me on this but it always returns to a 40-45x1."
I bought 200 at market open just for fun. Won’t have any impact on my position since I already hold a substantial position. 230 was way overdone but at 210 it’s easy to assume a move to 220 tonight.

"sold at 96.50 for a 21 percent profit in less than 22 hours. Can you day ""Cha-Ching?"""
Earnings in June will be stellar. Load the boat and truck on Five Below shares on this pullback. This is will pop above $145 in a few weeks. Buy and hold.
I enjoyed watching FIVE being traded live in this group today. They all made out well on it https://livetradingcourse.training/8at54
I love five
imo 200 plus by june
Institutions buying up shares in this one! Nice Uptrend!
earn on Wednesday looks like folks are excited
"Timberrrrr, wow!"
"Wow, they blew out earnings again, raised fy 2018 as well. In a normal market they’d probably go way up tomorrow, but trade worries right now make it hard for any retail stock to go up. We’ll see what the pre market does tomorrow, should be interesting. They raised guidance to 2.64 this year and they always aim low. We’ll see but I predicted 2.70 a while ago, which is just so funny, I remember the olden days when they had 325 stores and did .60 cents eps for all of 2013.... ah memories....."
"$222.22……. This is kinda amazing, I guess buying all those shares in March 2020 was a fairly good move."
"Blah blah blah... lots of mindless banter here... down 12%, obvious over-reaction (unless you're brain-dead)... will revert to the mean as the short-term shorters cover and the bottom feeders start nibbling... will probably up about $10 bucks from the lows in a week or two... yawn"
"Black Friday is Nov.23....and it is expected to be the biggest since inception. With the U.S running an unemployement rate of 3.7% (lowest since 1969). Five Below will run up to the moon. On Dec. 5 Five Below reports earnings, yet as we approach earnings day, Five Below share price will begin running upwards. With the addition of over 125 stores, and the Christmas shopping ahead in several weeks, Five Below should easily pop above $145 per/share on Dec. Nov. 29......as for the next earnings date after Christmas will be the best yet, which by then it's share price will touch $160...With only 54 million shares outstanding (no debt) and at 750 stores open, we have another 1750 stores to go that will be open."
"We are right at the bottom of this over-reaction to the downgrade. This is a classic dead-cat bounce and I only trade this kind of thing. I made a couple grand over the last two days with Crowdstrike who had a similiar over-reaction. This then is the perfect time to buy, right here about $187.80 at its low. This will pop $3 to $10 by tomorrow. Don't miss it!!!"
Anybody see a reason to why this should move up prior to positive Q4 results/guidance?
It took me 30 mins to short 500 shares. That’s how low the volume is. Hihihihi
"Lol lifetime high today…. Way to go beanie baby, way to go…."
"Five Below store count currently stands at 625, and a share price of $58.Here is my staircase of it's share price/number of stores.$58 - 625 stores (share price being 9% of number of stores)$63 - 700 stores$72 - 800 stores$81- 900 stores$90- 1000 stores$108 - 1200 stores$117 - 1300 stores$126 - 1400 stores$135 - 1500 stores.....at this point the p/e will come down slowly as they are closing in on 2000 plus stores. Yet, this is does not include international expansion to Canada. Canada in my opinion can support at least 300 stores.All the above are just estimates or a guess, yet, I like to play with numbers and know, that regardless, we are all in a winning stock.Cheers to everyone on this message board."
"Earnings date question. On yahoo finance the earnings date for Q3 is Dec. 5...yet, I see on Nasdaq they have Five Below Q3 on Nov. 29.Anyone here have a confirmed date."
"And congrats to all my followers who jumped on Reta, slb and aapl, huge gains!"
There’s no reason for this to go down . It should be going sky high . Great company with zero dept ... give me a break .. this market is a joke
"Third quarter is always a weak quarter, so no surprise on guidance, but Market expects so much now"
$177 next stop. Good support there.
I guess earnings were leaked two days ago. :(
Market cap is 9.651B and total stores are 950.So each store is worth 10.158 million?
"This game is in the 3rd inning plenty of game left. The new campaign stores are getting stronger and at the 20% new level it leaves us some nice open capacity to pile on the comps.The newer markets of Florida, Texas and California have the potential to add 500~+ stores. Great for comp growth far into the future. If you look at the greater Philadelphia market which is still adding stores you will find at even a 2-3% comp sales gain that the profits enjoy huge leverage on the sales base, This is one of the great US growth success stories. I believe that a split would be good for the stock as it would broaden share holder base.The only issue that will stop this company from hitting their stated goal f 2000 stores would be a buy out. This is a great cradle of comfort for long term share holders. I believe Anderson and his talented team are just now really firing on all cylinders. The best is still coming."
It’s down only due to profit taking. It will surpass $200. Be patient. Just look at their financials. Buy the dip and thank me later.
Good company buy now. Get paid for the hard work is done.
"A week ago this was 221, a month ago it was 199, a year ago it was 113, five years ago it was 47…. Hahaha I bought in 2015 at $35!!!!"
they have 750 stores...they plan to open 150 in 2019....and have 2500 by end of 2020??? so opening 1600 stores next year?
up $1.62 per share already for me
This is dead money until it drops and pops above 200 dma. This quarter will not be as profitable as the past two. Look for more downward pressure as this drops through q3 earnings all the way down to new lows. This is growing too fast and wall street sees it as unsustainable.
"Nice action today, especially if someone picked up a few hundred shares in the 170s a few weeks ago."
"Five Below bulls bullish on resultsDec. 5, 2019 11:52 AM ET|About: Five Below, Inc. (FIVE)|By: Stephen Alpher, SA News Editor While there may be some impact to the bottom line in the current quarter, tariffs aren't creating a big issue, says Jefferies' Randal Konik, following Five Below's (FIVE +3%) Q3 results last night. He adds annual guidance is solid, and long-term growth remains compelling. Konik sticks with his Buy rating and $150 price target.Scott Ciccarelli also isn't too worried about tariffs, and lifts his profit outlook for 2020 and 2021. He keeps an Outperform rating and raises his price target by $1 to $144.Loop Capital's Anthony Chukumba maintains a Buy and $145 price target. He's optimistic about the holiday season, noting Frozen II and the new Star Wars, recently implemented price hikes, and the new Ten Below Gift Shop areas."
"Oh beanie baby, You coulda listened to me when I toldya it was a bad idea to “short at $167”, and not to “reshort at $172” butcha didn’t. I gave you a detailed response, and you ignored it.... that was $25 dollars upside ago. The reason the pe is 98x1 is because they were shut down in q1 last year and reported (.93). THIS YEAR they’ll report $2.20 in q4 and easily report +$0.60 for q1 this year. In 9 weeks their ttm earnings will be $3.70+ and pe will flip to 55x1. NOT today’s 98x1. Is 55x1 a little high for this stock? Ya, a little, but with restrictions loosening, 200 new stores for 2021, more stimulus, and trending comps sales increases along with two new DCs up and running 2021 promises to see $4.50 eps for THIS year. And $4.50 in earnings this year with a 55x1 pe is.... wait..... a $247 share price by March 2022....... lol.... you shorted at $167!!!!"
BEAN IS BACK ON THE BOARD AFTER BEING SILENT FOR A FEW MONTHS. 100% MEANS TIME TO BACK THE TRUCK UP AND BUY MORE.... FACT.
"Firstly, I will state I love Five Below, and NO, I am not a basher, and not dumb enough to short a high beta stock like Five. Recently, Five got some upgrades. For those of you who are new to investing, let me explain why this is not a good thing. Once a stock has reached it's price ceiling, big institutions need to unload the stock without causing it to crash. Since Five is a low volume stock, institutions need to pump it a bit then unload. They know full well, they will be able to buy it much cheaper, at a lower price. I love Five Below, yet, I anticipate a much lower entry point. If you think Five Below is cheap right now, go ahead and buy it, you will be paying too much."
Only concern is their cost .. it’s going to go up up up until the trade war is over
"The pullback feels about right for a stock that ran back to 130 from 90 on dec 24th. I’d expect consolidation to 120ish. Assuming they could post 2.70 a share in earnings next month a 45x1 pe puts them at a $121 price after earnings, which is fairly valued. But they could get back to 128 after earnings (50x1pe). NOW I think they’ll have a very good q1 since this year Easter is the end of April and longest number of days from March 1 to Easter we’ve seen in 12 years. So lots of extra spring sale days. I think they could improve q1 by 35% and would put 12mo trailing earnings at $2.85 when they announce early June. Assuming a 45x1 to a 50x1 pe in June they would trade at $130 to 145. I think that’s the time to start getting out. June and July. I wouldn’t wait much longer than July to exit a portion of shares. I think holiday 2019 won’t be as strong Now long term I still see them $200+ by 2022 but I bet if they hit $140 this summer they’ll pull back and may not regain that price until mid to late 2020."
A BIG THANK YOU TO WHOMEVER GAVE UP THEIR SHARES TO ME TODAY @$188.00!! 3800+ SHARES LONG AND STRONG AT AN AVG OF $78.00/SHARE NOW.
"So there you go, I was right about Bean all along. He got on here on Jan 5 at $167 and preached his short thesis. He preached again at $172, at $177, and over and over in the 180s. Kept saying it would “go to 100 by March” it was “$56 fair value”, then it would go to 100 by year end. Never mind he never put any factual analysis or metrics behind the assertion, just his talkin out his but whole about his opinion I told him back in Jan he’d regret the short and would disappear in 6mo￼… and where is he now? Just like all the other failed shorts over the years as I watched this go from $32 to $200. I tell them all the same thing…. Your short will fail and you’ll disappear…. Bean’s just another example. Five will earn $5 a share this year $6+ in 2022 and $7.50 in 2023. They’ll be earning $10+ a share by 2025 and I was buying this when they only made .60 cents!!! This will sell for $275 by March 2024!!!! But who cares, I bought 10k+++ in the 30s, I’m already loaded!!!!"
Congrats guys. I missed out.
new high baby
He only comes back here occasionally so he can remind us what a failure that trade was… lol $167 to $232 in eight months.
nah they got jp morgan pushing the stock so it aint going anywhere
FIVE is rated #1 in it's sector according to IBD and has one of the Highest CANSLIM ratings! VERY Positive indicators! Institutional money cometh!!
Why hello 184 on an up market
"IN MY LOCAL FIVE BELOW YESTERDAY, SOUTH OF ATLANTA. TALKED TO MANAGER AND SHE SAID THEIR STORE AND THEIR REGION ARE BREAKING SALES RECORDS EVERY DAY SINCE THEY HAVE OPENED BACK UP!! SAID THE 5 AND BEYOND SECTION IS A HUGE SUCESS AND THATS ONE OF THE REASONS BECAUSE THE AVG TICKET PRICE IS UP FOR THEM AND THE REGION. BEST MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT HAS EVER BEEN IN THIS SECTOR!!"

Timberrrrr
"Highest price in 5 years, so you have to wonder if these prices can hold up. The economy starting to give a little more back to normal I just don't know if these high price stocks can continue"
"Thank you for all the accolades, to those who filled me from 237, time to be greedy as this is only the beginning"
"Ugh, I had to buy 1600 at 97.32... I hated to do it, I’d been laughing through this crash as I was heavy in cash, but today at 98 the PE is 31x1 and I’ve always said you buy all the five you can when the pe is below 35. I think their supply chain will see some serious disruption which will make q1 and 2 difficult but I’ll suffer through the short term pain and hope to see $140 by March 2021, that would be a very nice $68k payday. Still got a lot of cash so hey if it goes below $94 I’ll buy another 1000!"
"With potential for new stores and being ""Amazon Proof"" this boy has a huge growth story. In the 3 inning of a extra inning ball game. Buy and hold, enjoy the ride!!"
"Running up after the Morgan Stanley upgrade, who themselves upgraded in anticipation of this weeks holiday sales release. I love retail holiday sale release week. It’s like a 5th quarterly earnings release every year, and this year the overall news looks to be good as 2018 was the best consumer since 2006. Should be fun, but five needs to put up really good comps!"
$five rejected offer fo $zoom this is the dumbest decision of shareholders in the history of the world. five9 has $ 400 million in revenue turned down an offer of $ 15 billion. it is best decision for Vonage shareholders. Vonage has $ 150 million in revenue from the cloud communication center alone (that’s NewVoiceMedia that Vonage took over a long time ago) and the entire Voange has $ 1.5 billion in revenue. Cloud comuninacion platform from Vonage has 1.1 bl revenue. the rest (300 million usd is VoIP). if you were to watch multiple:for 150 million from cloud communications center Vonage should get 5.5 bl. Nexmo inside Vonage is worth only 8 bl plus TokBox 1 bl. so Zoom would get everything else for free if he took over Vonage. Vonage is currently just starting the process of selling the entire company as activist fund Jana Partners bought 4% of the shares and forced the company’s management to hire a sales consultant.
"Congrats to everyone that followed my lead and bought baba yesterday before earnings. Here is my up to date playlist. Buy baba, bmrn, Reta and root. Short five, pton and keys. Thank you formal the support and well wishes."
WE DID IT!
TRIED TO TELL TELL EVERYONE NOT TO SELL YESTERDAY... I'LL WAIT TO FEB AND UNLOAD SOME AT $225.00.
"FIVE stock is seriously overvalued. Look at Biglot. several times the revenue with stellar balance sheet and trading at less than half the market cap. FIVE cannot survive long term. It does nothing unique. With fast expansion, it will have a leveraged balance sheet and eventually go bankrupt."

"Come on people!!!... up 35%.... in four days???? Cuz they beat the quarter by a nickel???? And raised the year by .06 cents? Overdone???? Yes, they could eventually get to $100 but this is six months early! I guarantee you you’ll see mid 80s before November!! ( then back to over $100 by early 2019. $ Good stock long term but it often gets ahead of itself."
It’s down pre market. Not a good sign
"Lol who took my advice on here in 2015 and loaded up at $30?! JACKPOT! Hahaha Bean, told you so!"
BEAN: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME YOU SHORTED TODAY BECAUSE I PICKED UP ANOTHER 100 SHARES TODAY:):):)!!!

"Whenever someone gives you a list of their best holdings, make a watchlist called something like, ""Someone, Explorer."" Add the person's best stocks to the watchlist, and see who can really pick them over time. Here are my best stocks $SPCE, $M, $NK, $NVAX, $FIVE, $GPMT, and $CODX. Which are your best stocks?"
"hmm - can't be good for margins going forward if it happens: ""Trump says he's 'ready' to put tariffs on all $505 billion of Chinese goods imported to the US """
I am long and will remain long buying dips. The cost per container is not the challenge to eps.
"Going to be great week!!!!! Since Trump wins again last night we will see 130 Monday, $135 BY Friday."
This is actually a pretty cool store. My teenage daughter loves it and we bought all Xmas gifts for her cousins here. People do still like to shop in stores- particularly pre-teens and teens. I bought stock after being in the store several times. They are popping up everywhere in the city that I live in and always busy.

Obviously at $215 it’s over done. It’s fun to watch the run up but a little ahead of itself. Congrats to all the failed short sellers over the last five years. I told you y’all would disappear in embarrassment
"It’s December 2nd. Just 29 days till 2020. Four months ago I gave maloria the 100% rock solid guarantee there would be no China trade deal this year. Guaranteeing China doesn’t sign anything in 2019 and the only thing they’d be willing to sign before the 2020 election would be some watered down tariffs only deal that does not address technology transfer or IP disputes. This was predicted months before the term “phases” was ever discussed. As of right now today my predictions are coming to fruition. Nothing in 2019 and probably just a surface “phase 1” deal signed early next year which helps China mitigate 25% tariffs and trump claim a “paper” victory. What I’m telling all ya’all is to listen to me. I know how this stuff works. Five treaded water in 2019 and will tread water in 2020. Don’t expect it to get much past $150 next year and probably finishes 2020 at $140ish2021 is the next breakout year, after the DCs are built and in operation. Expect $190 by end of 2021 and $225 by mid 2022. Until then you’re gonna need to wait and be patient."
"Sitting at, or very near all time highs. I guess we should hope for a coronavirus every year :)"
bottom fishing strategy on the basis of misunderstanding of results and managements forecast.
Institutions own over 99% of FIVE which means it's oversold just like Burlington is over 100% owned by institutions and even though BURL hag great earnings got dumped after earnings for institution profits.Institutions like to pump before earnings and dump after no matter how great earnings are. Here is the deal hedge funds need to make money and once the stock is at a head like a pimple they pop it
Big time buying opportunity today!
I know I said if a company's growth rate is twice the S&P average its P/E can also be twice the average.Its all I can say because I don't understand concepts like cash flow and operating margin. But I used to just follow the herd and use 3 year charts. Baby steps.
"way oversold....guys, 100% owned by institutions....geez....relax"
They just opened and are shipping from the Shipping Center in Arizona and are opening a new one in Indianapolis next year I believe. The long term growth is there
And this is only the beginning ladies and gentlemen
I have 4 options that are due on the march 22nd and i have lost half of its value. Should i sell or wait? please advise
