I am long and will remain long buying dips. The cost per container is not the challenge to eps.
This company will be closer to 300 in one year than 200. No doubt
terrible q3 guidance. Diluted income per common share is expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.30
"We are right at the bottom of this over-reaction to the downgrade. This is a classic dead-cat bounce and I only trade this kind of thing. I made a couple grand over the last two days with Crowdstrike who had a similiar over-reaction. This then is the perfect time to buy, right here about $187.80 at its low. This will pop $3 to $10 by tomorrow. Don't miss it!!!"
"YA I coulda sold at $236 a week ago, but no biggie. I know retail, and the future of retail is brick and mortar.Besides just because other dollar stores like Dollartree warned about higher costs, didn't mean it would happen to FIVE, right?"
"Thank you for all the accolades, to those who filled me from 237, time to be greedy as this is only the beginning"
"So IF (and it’s still an if) they can bring in q3 flat to LY at about .35eps that leaves them at a $4.59 eps going into q4. Now, it looks like q3 will be flat in part because they’ve got new stores in q4 to pay for and bringing in holiday inventiry early to avoid port delays. So IF they can stay flat into q4 all they need is a 19%eps growth for just q4. If they can grow q4 from 2.20 to 2.61, which shouldn’t be to difficult, they will earn $5 a share this year. If they can earn $5 expect a share price of $225 in March. With a range of 40x1 to 50x1 that’s a price range of $200-$250. Then if they can just grow earnings 15% in 2022 that puts earnings at $5.75 and a price range of $230-287. None of this is a guarantee but 15-18% eps growth is conservative for a retailer gaining economy of scale and opening 18% new stores yoy."
The miss that made this low price available was in reality small and even exaggerated by their success. There is not another bricks and mortar retailer that can and will deliver the growth that Five will deliver. Short term target 210 by year end. $250 by year end 2022.
"Third quarter is always a weak quarter, so no surprise on guidance, but Market expects so much now"
"Blah blah blah... lots of mindless banter here... down 12%, obvious over-reaction (unless you're brain-dead)... will revert to the mean as the short-term shorters cover and the bottom feeders start nibbling... will probably up about $10 bucks from the lows in a week or two... yawn"
I just picked up some more. I believe the NOV30 Earnings report will be a blow out. New stores are stocked well. good impression and the new prototype is excellent. This is one of the best retail bets as it has already sold for more and will scale back quickly check your Fibonacci Retracement graph
"Five is in great position, even if tomorrow earning report not above analysts estimate, the future is great for FIVE, high volume of sales fromkids for last few years their estimate stock price $230- $300 ( mid price $265 )But the future is what count"
"Today’s $177 closing price puts them at around a 38x1 PE. That’s not great but it’s good. Their historical pe going back to ipo in 2012 is about 46x1. (Because of their rapid growth) I’ve always said it’s a good buy if the pe is between 36-40 and buy every single share you can if the pe goes below 36. I’ve taken my own advice and since my first purchase in January 2014 I’ve accumulated well over 15,000 shares with an average below $40. I nibble a little today at 178 and I’ll buy a few hundred more here or there over the next few days. I guarantee you 101% this will get back to $225. Maybe by March? maybe by end of 2022? Maybe not till 2023? (Doubt it will be that long) the concept is a hit, it will be back to $235 at some point in its future and I guarantee $275 by 2024. They’ll EASLY be at $7.50 a share by end of 2024!"
Ya 45 times earnings seems about right for a brick and mortar retailer growing sales mid teens.Unfortunately I really don't understand things like valuation. I like charts.
"I Am Back! After 60 days in county for a couple dui's n assault, I just wanna thank everybody for the outpouring of support. I will try and respond to everyone's messages sometime this week. I am glad I liquidated before going in the can. I will be putting the whole kit and kaboodle on this easy short. This may be the easiest short in the last 100 years. My short alone will drop it 2 bucks tomoro morning. Thank you for all the well wishes I will report in later this week. Ty!"
"Value Line likes Five below - read belowFive Below gave another outstandingperformance recently. Sales in the fiscal second quarter ended July 31st pickedup sharply from the year-earlier periodand jumped 55% from the like quarter infiscal 2019. Comparable store sales surged21% on a two-year basis. The specialty discount store chain, which caters to tweensand teens, again saw broad-based strengthacross its product categories. Governmentstimulus benefits, an easing of pandemicrestrictions, and solid demand were mostlybehind the brisk customer traffic. Shareearnings more than doubled from theprior-year quarter and were up a whopping 125% from 2019’s prepandemic term.We still look for significant top- andbottom-line gains this fiscal year,near-term challenges notwithstanding. With increased COVID-19 vaccinations and more shoppers headed out tostores, the October period seemed to be offto a good start, though comp-store saleswere expected to moderate some. A fewfactors, including uncertainties overCOVID-19 variants, may dampen businessin the near term, however. Managementremains focused on key strategic initiatives related to the product, customer experience, and the supply chain, where it isworking to mitigate the impact of globaldisruptions. Still, pandemic-related costs,higher shipping expenses, and merchandise delays will likely add some pressure.Potential shifts in consumer spendingcould hurt demand, too. That said, wethink Five Below will navigate throughthese conditions, and expect sales and EPSfor fiscal 2021 to take a big step forward.Management is sticking with its loftygrowth plan. Five Below remains ontrack to expand the store base, with up to180 new shops slated to open in fiscal2021; the long-term goal is to grow thechain to 2,500 total units. Along withother growth opportunities, it continues totest higher price points through a newstore format (Five Beyond), which carriesofferings like video games. Combined,these initiatives should spur healthy salesand profit advances out to mid-decade.Five Below shares are a timely choice.But the issue, which is not cheap on a P/Ebasis, has just about average capital appreciation potential 3 to 5 years hence."
"Goodness I bought between 177 and 168 and it goes back to 185 in two days!? Lol. Like I’ve said for six years, buy when the pe gets close to 36"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
I'd be wealthy too from owning 160 shares of FIVE Only problem is I shorted GME from $4 twice last year.Now I just play pretend.What else can I do?
The smell of increased sales and Profits are spilling out will be over 200 very soon and they will be a bargain even then.
$194! Lol I told you three weeks ago a 36x1 pe at $168 was a good price! Who just made 15% in 12 days? ME! Haha
$177-$179 next stop
Why hello 184 on an up market
"Haha if someone bought 10-20k of shares in 2014,2015,2016 they’d be pretty wealthy right here!!!!!"
"Ya, as I’m reading the 10k the weak q3 guidance makes more sense now. They’re projected to open stores in q3 that should have been opened in q2 (construction delays) and they’re really ramping up inventory in q3. Looks like they’re trying to get ahead of the shipping delays to get holiday Merch into stores early. It all makes sense now and could set them up for a good q4 but I’d not expect to see a measurable price increase until they announce holiday sales at n early January. Either way I can’t sell anymore shares this year because of capital gains limits, my goal is to harvest profits by selling 2k shares a year every March until 2026 then just hold the remaining shares to see what happens."
TRIED TO TELL TELL EVERYONE NOT TO SELL YESTERDAY... I'LL WAIT TO FEB AND UNLOAD SOME AT $225.00.
I backed up the truck. Thanks for the cheap shares.
Timberrrr see ya 180s
WE DID IT!
A BIG THANK YOU TO WHOMEVER GAVE UP THEIR SHARES TO ME TODAY @$188.00!! 3800+ SHARES LONG AND STRONG AT AN AVG OF $78.00/SHARE NOW.
$five rejected offer fo $zoom this is the dumbest decision of shareholders in the history of the world. five9 has $ 400 million in revenue turned down an offer of $ 15 billion. it is best decision for Vonage shareholders. Vonage has $ 150 million in revenue from the cloud communication center alone (that’s NewVoiceMedia that Vonage took over a long time ago) and the entire Voange has $ 1.5 billion in revenue. Cloud comuninacion platform from Vonage has 1.1 bl revenue. the rest (300 million usd is VoIP). if you were to watch multiple:for 150 million from cloud communications center Vonage should get 5.5 bl. Nexmo inside Vonage is worth only 8 bl plus TokBox 1 bl. so Zoom would get everything else for free if he took over Vonage. Vonage is currently just starting the process of selling the entire company as activist fund Jana Partners bought 4% of the shares and forced the company’s management to hire a sales consultant.
Amazon is not Analogous to this retailer. Wait for target earnings in three weeks to see how retail looks.
Good company no doubt but they have problems to deal with. First off Chinese products are going way up. Containers are costing ten times what they were. Everything in their wheelhouse is way up. Plus they were starting employees out at $11 an hour. That has either gone up or will have to. They can’t find workers. They can’t pass on most of this to the customers because it has to be $5 below. Like dollar tree. I am waiting for it to go up a little more and then will be buying puts for earnings and January.
Bean let me give you an advice. Today is Options Expiration ( Now go look at open interest in the puts & calls)Notice how there are no open interest on the call side but hundreds & thousands on the put side. If you think the market makers are going to let put buyers cash out on all that money then you are new to this...
"Nice action today, especially if someone picked up a few hundred shares in the 170s a few weeks ago."
"Personally I believe that this standout brick and mortar retailer is very undervalued at just 39 times this year's earnings. If I didn't short GME at $4 last year, I would buy more here. Thank god I still have 160 shares."
bounce tomorrow
Will this stock ever reach 200 again any time soon????
Heading to Vegas tomoro to celebrate
I guess earnings were leaked two days ago. :(
