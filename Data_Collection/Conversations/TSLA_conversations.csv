"Anyone notice Yahoo always features Tesla bashing articles and even when it's good news, it's done in a backhanded manner. Just like how Yahoo keeps messing with this message board. Tesla in inevitable, folks. Deal with it!"
Panasonic sold it's entire lot of shares in Tesla on account that the shares are grossly over valued and fully matured based on future earnings. Time to sell. Game Over for Tesla shareholders holders. The dream has now come to an end.
"How many times has Musk told about FSD? This last weekend he says that reality is much harder than he thought...His current ""FSD"" is level 2 and FSD is level 5.More so, the Chinese auto market began to shrink last month.All the growth, the moon, Mars ... where are they gonna come from?Why do you need leasing to your own employees of SpaceX etc. to achieve the bare minimum of deliveries if demand is so high?"
"Why is Musk, the CEO of a company with a large stake in BTC-USD, continuing to endorsing DOGE-USD? Perhaps he has a private interest in DOGE? If it is determined that this is the case, his actions warrant removal by the non-existent BofD, and sets Tesla up for a legal nightmare. As an occasionally short, I'm loving it. Anyone long TSLA, should be outraged."

Better buy before Wednesday and mandatory before July 1 at midnight!!!!Hint
Tesla is setting up for a massive short squeeze. It will be way bigger than GME and AMC. Hold and buy the dips.
FUDists on Saturday: Tesla recall in China!!! Tesla: Completes “recall” (OTA) before market opens on Monday.
"Enhanced AP is now more expensive than FSD ($5K vs. $3K). Musk is moving the few attributes of FSD that sort of work, into AP, and increasing the price. This move is evidence that FSD, that Tesla has been touting, will never reach fruition, and they are trying to mitigate legal exposure. Too late, 'ole chap! Worse than the bundling of sub-prime mortgage debacle."
CATL Extends Battery Supply Deal with Tesla
Tesla's recall is just a software update from over the airwaves... not a big deal people.
"We seen the same story over and over. Problem is shorts never learn until they lose it all. I’m confident TSLA is in an uptrend now. Ok don’t listen to me shorts, but don’t look for compassion from this board post $650."
"""Will Tesla CEO Elon Musk Accept The Ultimate Challenge From Ford?Asked if the Mustang Mach-E would be drag racing the Tesla Model S Plaid ""for bragging rights,"" Farley replied: ""Good idea.""The vehicle features no fewer than seven electric motors three in the front and four at the rear — packing a total of 1,400 horsepower.""I doubt it. Musk is too busy tweeting about Bitcoin."
"It’s amazing how many commenters on this platform and others who think they know better than Elon Musk how to manage his enterprises. Not referring to those offering valid concerns, different theories or well thought-out and researched constructive criticism.There is no company on Earth (including Tesla’s competition) that couldn’t improve on what they do. There is no CEO that can claim perfection. Neither is there a share of stock of a company that can guarantee constant returns, dividends and a rising market capitalization. All of them are subject to the vagueness of the marketplace, management styles, supply and demand, regulation, new technology, Mother Nature’s fickleness and the cause and effects of economic cycles. Nor can any company (or institution) always meet their own and others stated goals, timelines and expectations.But occasionally one comes along that does, in the overall, stand out as distinctive and unique. It’s leadership is especially germane, talented, visionary, risk adverse and industry disruptive. No matter what others think or say Tesla is not in it for turf building, money or power. But for the betterment of humankind. They consistently and prudently reinvest any wealth acquired back into future growth.Vilified by some simply because the leader is brilliant and successful. If detractors (for whatever reasons) can’t legitimately refute his performance they personally attack them and their supporters. They’re made fun of and are called every disparaging name in the book. In their eyes Elon Musk can do no right. Can’t stop haters from hating. But it becomes evident their rancor tells more about who they are and their own issues than their target. It reverts to an unforgiving meanness no matter the exculpatory evidence to the contrary. But in the end it accomplishes nothing. Nobody knows the future of Tesla, but it’s looking better every day. Those that attempt to engage in a battle of wits with Elon Musk are unarmed."
So why this is suddenly up? What changed?

Tesla must be a rock solid company otherwise after so much of a highly organized bombardment of propaganda it would have finished by now.
"TSLA, among other stocks, extreme moves over the past year are ALL about the Fed's easy-money policies. If the Fed just hints that it's ""thinking about"" the possibly of backing off the money spigot from its ""full on"" position, expect stocks like TSLA to come crashing back to earth."

"Tesla Inc said on Saturday it has introduced an option for some customers to subscribe to its advanced driver assistance software, dubbed ""Full Self-Driving capability"", for $199 per month, instead of paying $10,000 upfront.Tesla has previously said its subscription service would generate recurring revenue and expand the customer base for pricy features including lane changing on highways and parking assistance.But the U.S. electric carmaker reiterated on Saturday that the current features ""do not make the vehicle autonomous,"" adding they ""require a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel.So, what is the point of having ""Full Self-Driving Capability"" if you have to pay attention the whole time and have your hands on the wheel? Seems pretty stupid, no?"
So the CEO hates his job and the stock gets bid up 4 percentSign of a bubble
"Muskrat better keep pumping Bitcoin to fluff up the Tesla bank balance, because vehicle sales are going to be very unkind to tesla for the next report."
Remember the FORD Pinto? Did that thing used to combust and that caused the car to be eliminated? Think about Tesla's...you're sitting on a lithium ion battery - that's scary and I think most ppl don't understand just how dangerous it is. No worries though - the truth will be revealed...unfortunately ppl may die in the process.
"I believe what people miss here is that Tesla is not just an EV company, they’re a TECHNOLOGY company…."
"clearly a scam company. they recall almost 300,000 cars and the stock price goes up! that would be ok if they produced millions of cars but they haven't come close to that number yet!!!!!"
Future Case Elon vs TSLA's Holder ... EEOC matters (Solor City is Different Case)All TSLA's Employees are Equal ... Way of Elon Work is not Equal to all others ...Violated EEOC's Rule!!!

Record car sales! Going to $1000 or a stock split!
"ELON is a GENIUS!! TSLA to 750 by next week. Vehicle deliveries for Q2 announcement expected next week. Possibly 220,000++ vehicles. Back to 900 in 2 weeks. 1100 - 1500 by Dec/Jan."
"$WKHS Alright guys I don't post much but I believe I should share some of my knowledge. I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding over 51% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with it currently being #5 most talked about on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.Overall, I see crazy potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now!"
"guess nobody told Teslitas that the market was down today... I live in London and everyone who can, is getting a Tesla that used to have a Porsche or Audi and if you've been here you know that's pretty much the standard!"
"Daimler is planning on spinning off Freightliner as a separate company by year's end. The EV eCascadia begins production in 2022. Additionally, they have been testing the autonomous Inspiration on Western highways for three years. Time to paint the Tesla Semi prototype (mockup) a different color, and have it seen testing ""in the wild""."
The recall of 285000 cars in the Chinese Market due to safety issues will have a very negative impact on price monday. When will they get their quality under control
"Since all the brightest minds in the automotive autonomous realm are tripping over each other to have the oppoturtinity (and honor) of working for Mr. Musk, why is there a need to host an ""A.I. Day"" as a recruiting tool?"
Have you bought yesterday? I told you not to...Remember: averaging down in a company with serious issues is never a good strategy.
"Congrats longs. Great sign seeing Tesla is up while market is down (In Red). Keep thinking long, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."
"If Musk loses the solar city case against him, won't there be action taken by the SEC following up for illegal actions of Elon as the CEO of a publicly traded company. Seems like they would have to fine him or take away his rights to be CEO of any publicly traded company."
Elon ripped off all those people who buy dogecoin hahaha. Congratulations king!
"Hmm... I don't know... should I pay $200/month for glorified cruise control, or should I buy 66 gallons of gas that will last my ICE car 2 months??? Ha Ha Ha! Oh wait...what????

Can any other company do that?TESLA has the TECH that is 10 years ahead of all other companies. CHOOSE invest in the future or the Past."

"C'mon Tesla, finish green today."
While in Oregon this past weekend for the olympic trials my wife and I saw over 140 trucks with model 3s and Ys on them. Amazing. We only saw about 3 or 4 other car haulers the whole time.
Kevin wrote he looked at a parking lot and didn’t see any EVs so that means the worldwide transformation to electric vehicles isn’t happening. Thus illustrating a childlike understanding. pre development of object permanence. The EVs are still in the world even if you don’t see them in your local parking lot Kevin
$TSLA folks are coming here tomorrow
"To alleviate the water shortages in America's Southwest, Elon Musk's Boring Company is suggesting a government funded water tunnel from Duluth, MN, to an undisclosed destination near Baker, CA. Rumor is, Musk has been buying property near Death Valley, incidentally, all properties have the exact same elevation (beach front?). The tunnel proposed will also be large enough a accommodate a Tesla Model X, so that in times of non-drought, it can be used as a alternate route, to alleviate the traffic congestion between Duluth, and Ogallala, NE. Musk says the $2.4T project can be started immediately ,right after the IPO, of which, current Tesla owners, and TSLA stock holders, will get first dibs on purchasing. The city of Niagara Falls, Canada, is opposed to the plan."
"I ordered my model x in March, suppose to be delivered in June, now November, if I’m lucky What a joke Musk, stop tweeting and make cars"
"Could TSLA be worth as much as $400 in 2023? When will the reality of the fact that TSLA is a car company and there is just a limited market cap that the market can really support with actual earnings?Obviously, the longs are still quite deluded."
Past 30 days GM is down 10% it’s price driven by wet dreams of Prototypes Nikola and Lordstown but in the end you actually have to build these cars. To date we have the Bolt this after 30 years of GM development. GM better start producing NOW or they will be bankrupt once again. I posted this last week when GM was only down 4% now down 10%. By next week we’ll be down 15% GM is overpriced based on hype
Finally. A nice day for TESLA. LONG TIME NO SEE!!!!!
Can you tell me when delivery number will be released?
"Tesla's revenue is 23% of Daimler's revenue.Tesla's market cap is 786% of Daimler's market cup.In terms of quality, Tesla is by far behind Mercedes, at least in Europe everybody knows it.Don't you, Tesla fanatics, think something is a little bit wrong?"

"The US intelligence community on Friday released it's hotly anticipated report. After extensive study of grainy videos, and eyewitness reports, it was concluded that there is no definitive evidence that Cyber Trucks actually exists. The incident in Los Angeles was determined to be a well concocted hoax, a mockup, a cheap fake toy model, and the recent sighting in New York, a case of mass hysteria, ignited by overwhelming irrational exuberance. The report does concludes that there is no proof the truck does not exit either, it just can't be confirmed at this time."

The answer is yes.Ford, on the other hand, is valued at 0.5x annual revenue.GM is valued at 0.75x annual revenue.VW is valued at 0.7x annual revenue.Anyone else see a disconnect here?At 0.75x revenue (which for TSLA is now shrinking!), TSLA is worth $26 billion, or $21/share.That is all you need to know. Everything else is fluff, spin and hype."
I just love how if Tesla has one single problem they get 100 percent criticism but just about everything they are criticized for are the same issues or similar issues other automakers face in the same industry. But guess what nobody puts it on a front page. I wonder why? Let's ask that wonderful question of why that is so we can see the truth. And also I find it funny that more bad news is put out about them vs good news. I wonder why?
Tesla's June car sales report will be a record I think more Tesla cars on the road now than ever...see you @ 800 soon

"Tesla's $1,500 charge to some customers to upgrade hardware, to be able to subscribe to it's $199/month FSD (wink, wink), is definitive proof that Elon's ""All cars built since 2017 have the hardware for FSD"". Let the games (lawsuits) begin."
"((( Last month, Ford Motor F pledged to invest at least $30 billion in EVs by 2025, ))) Wow. At $2 billion per platform that's 15 new unique electric platforms. They would need to sell roughly 7.5 million electric cars per year to justify 15 platforms. Reality - Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es In Q1 2021 in the USA. That's about 30,000 a year. Not exactly a runaway success IMO."

"Tesla battery fires? “More than 6.5 million vehicles are under recall because they could catch fire at any moment. While that is alarming, what may be more disturbing are the vehicles at risk that are not included in the massive recall.”There are far fewer Tesla car fires. There are over a million Teslas on the road in the world today. “In 2019, there were around 189,500 highway vehicle fires reported in the United States.”Saying Teslas are fire traps is untenable when compared to the number of ICE vehicles that catch fire."

"Tesla $131,000 Model S Plaid too expensive? Not really. There will be many high-end buyers on the waiting list wanting the latest Tesla upgrade on all of its models. There would be no flagship Model S if the proof-of-concept Tesla Roadster hadn’t been produced. If the Model S didn’t happen there would be no Model X. The Model 3 wouldn’t be around if there were no Model X. And no Model Y after the Model 3. All these Tesla models are brand precursors to the Supercar Roadster, semi, the cybertruck, an under $25,000 BEV and a electric tunnel transport van. These will come out much sooner as Tesla’s gigafactories expand and come online. Worldwide Supercharging and autonomy will rule. Competition? Hope so, because it will take a lot of manufacturers to replace the 2 billion ICE vehicles in the world today. Also there is solar power in everyone’s future."

Remember Elon Musk raised five billion dollars through the second offering at $767 a share last December. I pity those people buying those shares at $767. Because Elon used that raised cash to buy Bitcoins. Most of your money has gone kaput.

My dentist keeps having to reschedule because her employees keep quitting because their unemployment benefits are so high. She also said that the benefits are so lucrative that many are tempted to work and collect at the same time. Some of her competition have shut down their offices because they cannot get workers. This is why socialism does not work. She was paying them well but many people are happy to exist at levels just above poverty and today's unemployment seems to get them there. The sooner they cut off these lavish benefits the better. I want dental services back. I think my dentist is very unhappy with how this played out. I am sure it will impact her view of who she wants running the government.I also noticed that when the restaurants reopened that many of professional waiters and waitresses are gone. They must have decided that their career choice was not stable enough now that they know that the government can lock down and put you out of work. These people did so well on tips that they probably had financial obligations that they could no longer meet.

Bottom line, TSLA is slowly climbing out of the abyss. There isn't a real bear case to be made on TSLA. The stock is not overvalued according to many misguided people on here but actually severely undervalued, competition is not a threat to their business the way people make it out to be because autos are not TSLA's only business, etc. You want to short and keep getting more of what you've gotten over the last few years that's your business.

"It’s done. The BEV is taking over matching or beating the average ICE vehicle’s value and operating cost. Tesla my loose market share in the luxury priced BEVs to the competition. But will grow in the more important and competitive mass produced “everybody’s BEV”. Tesla will dominate.It’s advancing software, lower cost per KWH battery technology, proprietary charging network and autonomous capability are way ahead of the competition.The legacies are pouring $ billions into converting to electrification. But are still behind in high demand and reaching mass production.Tesla is quickly and seriously increasing manufacturing efficiency and capacity. It’s building dedicated BEV gigafactories (terafactories) worldwide. Demand for the current Model 3 and Y are insatiable. Their new cybertruck and planned $25K Model 2 and will dominate.Tesla is exponentially exceeding the traditional “S-Curve” technology industry adoption model. Still, in the middle and late 2020s, Tesla doesn’t have to claim the larger market share of BEVs to be successful. These BEV advances were originally predicted to happen in the 2030s."
"Tesla quality?Took delivery of a 2021 Model Y last December. Had a 17 item check list in hand (from the Internet) of flaws to look for. My Tesla has ALL 17 and more. There were so many defect I actually lost count. Close inspection showed that every single part on the car was made improperly. Not 90% or 95% but 100% of the parts were defective. The car was perfectly flawed - everything was 100% wrong. It now has 7,000 miles on it with over 7,000 service visits That's one breakdown per mile on average. In over a half century of driving many different makes and models this is the worst car I've ever owned. I also have several Tesla cars sitting unused because I can't afford to repair them. BNo one will buy them. I have even offered to pay people to take them away - but no one answers my ads. Anyone who believes people who disagrees with me has never owned a Tesla. Every single Tesla owners is completely 100% dissatisfied with their cars. It's amazing really. 100% dissasatification is rare - but Tesla has done it. PS: I am just mocking Tesla longs here."

Why is Tesla callling the OTA update to fix the cars in China an inconvenience when they always promoted those type of things and a major convenience in the past? Make on wonder if they really have a fix or are just going to make it harder to use.

"Gosh knows I don't ever have much good to say about TSLA stock - but I do think there is strong support at $600. Doesn't seem to go much below or above. I think when Q2 production and earnings numbers come out that will be a catalyst for a movement either up or down. I think the stock will stay in the $580-$620 range until then. Maybe Musk has some surprise announcement he is planning, like maybe the Cybertruck shipping early, that will goose the stock. So ON THE BRIGHT SIDE I don't see anything that will make this stock fall unless Q2 numbers disappoint, which they probably won't. I think expectations are in the 190K-210K for vehicle deliveries and I think people kind of know based on that what the EPS will be."

"With FSD V9, Tesla Is Becoming An AI Robotics CompanyYarrow Bouchard | AlphaSummaryTesla is close to releasing Full Self-Driving Version 9 or FSD v9, the latest version of its AI-assisted city driving software.FSD v9 is the result of significant progress by Tesla AI’s engineers and will itself accelerate progress by scaling up Tesla’s fleet data collection.AI-assisted driving is not just a nice add-on for a fancy car; it’s a paradigm shift in the experience of driving and our idea of what a car is.As this becomes more apparent to analysts, the consensus narrative on Tesla will shift and the stock price will increase something like two-fold within the next two years.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is becoming an AI robotics company. This is integral to any defensible valuation of the company. Yet so many equity analysts have either denied this fact or hand-waved it away by simply declaring it outside the scope of their analysis. This is an error of tectonic scale. I believe this error results in Tesla stock being priced at something on the order of 50% of what it ought to be."

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of people aged 65+ suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in the US will nearly triple during the next 50 years, from an estimated 5.8 million people today to 14 million in 2060. The approval of Aducanumab was surprising for several reasons:Broad Label: Doctors will be able to prescribe Aducanumab for any Alzheimer’s patients whether they suffer from mild or severe forms of the disease. This broad label was a surprise because the clinical trial included only patients suffering from a mild form of Alzheimer’s.Cost: Aducanumab will cost $56,000 annually, a high sticker price given its low efficacy.Toxicity: In its approval, the FDA seemed to place little to no emphasis on toxicity, which is puzzling because Alzheimer’s patients will have difficulty communicating ill effects to their families and care givers.Clinical Benefit: Biogen will have nine years to complete the trial and demonstrate that Aducanumab delivers clinical benefit.Imaging Requirements: By the end of their first year on Aducanumab, patients will have to undergo an MRI instead of a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to confirm beta-amyloid, the drug’s target.Advisors: Three of the nine advisors on the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee - Aaron Kesselheim, Joel Perlmutter, and David Knopman – stepped down following the approval.If the FDA seems to be approving therapeutic agents targeted at diseases with high unmet needs before confirmatory trials end, we believe the value of other such therapies showing little clinical efficacy could be much higher than most investors expect.$crsp $arkg $tsla"

"Tesla apologizes for massive recall in China, explains OTA update detailsPhate ZhangJune 26, 2021Tesla apologizes for massive recall in China, explains OTA update details-CnEVPostFollowing the announcement of its massive recall plan in China, Tesla apologized to owners and explained the details of the OTA recall in a Q&A format.Tesla filed a recall plan with China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) and decided to recall a cumulative total of 285,520 vehicles effective immediately, information posted on the SAMR's official website Saturday showed.The recall involves most vehicles sold by Tesla in China since 2019. It's related to just the vehicle software, though, and the company will provide a fix via OTA. In a statement posted on Weibo later, Tesla customer support said the company apologized for the inconvenience the recall has caused owners.""Tesla will continue to improve and enhance safety in strict accordance with national requirements and make every effort to bring an excellent and safe driving experience to our customers,"" the statement said.The vehicles included in this recall have safety hazards in extreme situations due to the active cruise control function that may be mistakenly activated by the driver. Tesla has taken the initiative to file a recall plan with the SAMR, the statement said."

It never happened. ))) ((( CEO Elon Musk explained how the team is set to follow a three-step process to get its vehicles offering rides to people. The company plans to enable every Tesla vehicle built since October 2016, all of which have been fitted with a suite of cameras and sensors, to upgrade its software and computer to support point-to-point autonomous driving with no human taking over. This, in turn, will enable the car to offer rides to members of the public autonomously – all without requiring a human driver. )))It never happened."

"Folks, Tesla had a great run this week that's a fact. Up more than 10 % is a week is quite an accomplishment. The fact that there are massive weekly call volumes for Friday 6/25 means that there is going to be a huge selloff tomorrow afternoon, because nobody has been selling, it's going to be epic. Also, the world's largest car market is China. Local players, and some of the majors are making it tough for Tesla to compete over there this quarter. Tesla had Robust China sales in q1, and still was barely profitable. With Btc tanking, and an end to the EV rebates in the infrastructure bill, it makes you wonder what the future holds?Take profits and don't end up holding Elon's bag."

"Tesla crashes. Any vehicle death is a tragedy, no matter the vehicle . NHSTA’s Special Case Investigation program provides in-depth and detailed data on on specific crashes They only pick to do about 100 a year. “The SCI program's flexibility allows for investigations of new emerging technologies related to automotive safety. A number of incidents involving alternative fuel vehicles, passenger side air bag deployments, vehicle-to-pedestrian impacts, and child restraint systems have been investigated. These anecdotal SCI cases are utilized by NHTSA and the automotive safety community to understand the real world performance of emerging systems.”There are currently 18 SCI investigations this year about Teslas. These are “anecdotal”. But there are thousands more fatality cases reported on by the NHTSA that involve ICE vehicles. The agency has the duty to investigate BEV incidents. But to keep it in perspective there are far fewer of them. It seems Teslas are getting focused SCI attention, 18% of their cases !"

When Tesla goes up the forum shows the latest comments XD...
Panasonic bought 1.4 millions shares at $25.15 a share when Tesla IPO in 2010. They just sold all shares at once. They know this price is too good to be true. TSLA will only go down from here.
((( ... the new charging station in Tibet may prove to be an important milestone for Tesla. ))) I would call it a game changer ... or an example of Telsa being forced into small markets because the large ones are saturated and they NEED to keep the growth story alive so that insiders can continue to sell shares.
"no news and tsla is rising, explain pleasetechnically its chart is pointing downtrend(deadcross)"
not a recall. software update that is updated remotely... Funny how the news pumps out take news
"Tesla ...Bad for environmentOn April 17, when firefighters responded to a 911 call at around 9:30 p.m., they came upon a Tesla Model S that had crashed, killing two people, and was now on fire.They extinguished it, but then a small flare shot out of the bottom of the charred hulk. Firefighters quickly put out those flames. Not long after, the car reignited for a third time.“What the heck? How do we make this stop?’” Buck asked his team. They quickly consulted Tesla’s first responder guide and realized that it would take far more personnel and water than they could have imagined. Eight firefighters ultimately spent seven hours putting out the fire. They also used up 28,000 gallons of water — an amount the department normally uses in a month. That same volume of water serves an average American home for nearly two years."
I sometimes wonder how those calling Tesla a fraud deal with that much cognitive dissonance. Must be a strain on their mental health. Tesla sells the best car in the world for a fraction of the price of the second best. (And returns 40% on operating assets in the process)
"Based on recent momentum & growth rally, this is heading way up ... go Tesla! "

Volkswagen Group - 25% share of EV sales in Europe Stellantis - 14% share Daimler - 12% share BMW - 11% share Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance - 9% share Tesla 5.2%Because Tesla can't make an ICEV they are not a significant player in the auto business. Competition in the EV niche is making Tesla less significant there.
Technically speaking TSLA is at trend channel resistance. It could bust through or fall back.
"I understand you TSLA fans don't want to be bothered with P/E or other fundamental indicators of value because (1) TSLA's not a car company it's a tech company (2) TSLA is going to be the largest market cap company, (3) TSLA is not just one company, it's a dozen start ups all with great growth, etc. etc. ...But tell me this: if the prospects for TSLA are so great and the stock a screaming buy at these levels, why are insiders so consistently selling? They, who are in the best position to understand TSLA's prospects, exercise stock options, only to sell the stock immediately. In other companies they tend to hold at least some of the shares.NAVI, just to give an example, (I am not recommending purchase, but I own it so watch it) has had a whole string of executives exercise stock options without any selling."

They could close them more and flood shorelines in three states, if they wanted to. I doubt very much any pipelines draining impact would overwhelm the ability to control the lake levels considering the quadrillions gallons of water there and flowing into ithttps://greatlakes-seaway.com/en/the-seaway/"

"Two years ago, every car manufacture was excited in solid state battery. Elon Musk even had Battery Day in anticipation the arrival of solid state battery (not him or Tesla invented solid state battery. He just likes to take other people's credits.) Anyway at that time, it was like 95% finished in the lab. Looks like it could be commercialized very soon. It turns out the rest 5% is more difficult and more time consuming than the first 95%. Almost all BEV makers have abandoned solid state battery, at least not in the nest five years future. I predict Elon Musk will follow suit. No solid state battery for Tesla!! No more Battery Day hype!!!"
"I've not gone anywhere just silently watching the stock price go up and others still bad mouthing. While factories are opening in Texas, Germany, China."
TESLA POWER WALL going to China soon!!!plaid
"Strong competition in 2013 when Japanese, German EV are in mass production."
"If you invested in $100,000 5 years ago in these 3 stocks you would now have…..Tesla : $1,300,000 (+1300%)S&P500 : $200,000 (+100%)Ford : $105,000 (+5%)LMFAO @ Ford longs"
One of the most unrecognized advantages of Tesla is in continued innovation of the production process.
Model S Plaid fastest production car in galaxy.
700+ tmrw is very possible
Tesla hits another 'bump in the road' in China with huge recall.https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/business/tesla-china-recall-intl-hnk/index.html?utm_source=optzlynewmarketribbon
"$TSLA China announces 33,155 china made Tesla automobiles sold in June."
something is brewing…I don’t know what but it smells good. Shorties?
So many irons in the fire for Tesla. Tremendous.
"Elon Musk’s bad bet: Bitcoin’s sudden dive will hit Tesla with a Q2 lossJust before 9 AM on June 22, Bitcoin's price sank to $29,511, its lowest level since the early hours of January 2, and 55% off its all-time record of $64,863 achieved just ten weeks ago. This is bad news for all crypto investors, but especially so for BTC's chief influencer, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The reason: Musk likely bought every Bitcoin on Tesla's books at a higher price. The upshot is that in Q2, Tesla will be taking a substantial write-down on the celebrated wager that helped launch the bull run that's turned into a freefall.By just after noon, Bitcoin had surged back to around $32,000. As we'll see, that relief rally won't save Tesla from booking a hefty charge."
700 is the next Floor
"TSLA short interest report as of 6/15 shows the lowest level of short interest since the stock split, less than 40 million. Hardly much basis for a short squeeze."
"The month of June still has over a week of selling days left (9 if you count today) and Tesla's quarter end sales are powering ahead. With another 55 cars sold so far today (Saturday sales are unusual in Norway), Tesla has sold 1756 cars this month which is more than double the next best seller. But who is that next best seller?Well, it's Ford. The third is NOT Volkswagen (brand), it's Skoda. Skoda is a VW company of course, but its not VW. They are in 4th place.The next 6 places are all the usual suspects. Volvo, Nissan, Hyundai, BMW, Audi and Mercedes.Tesla can take great comfort that in the most diverse EV market in the western world (Norway), that Tesla has the best selling car, the Tesla Model 3. The downsides is that their marketshare continues to drop. They will likely end up with <10% marketshare on a YTD basis at the end of June in Norway. The number of cars being sold by competitors is ramping nicely and the number of competitors is ramping nicely.There will be 17 individual vehicles with over 1000 units sold by the end of June and 4 of those will have over 3,000 units sold in Norway. That will come from 16 different brands and 11 different companies.This isn't 2018 anymore . . . competition is here.Guru."
"It's clear that the shorts are on the loosing train, that just left the station. Nothing will stop the best EV and Software company in the world. TSLA will most likely reach $1200 to $1500 by year end and will announce a split. Yes, there will be red days But the trend is up. $700 will appear an amazing entery point in a year from now."
"tsla/solar city doesn't know how to install solar systems - another case studyJust search for this:A couple says their Tesla Solar panels caused relentless leaks that led to mold 10 times the healthy limit, $115,000 in damages, and a long-running legal battle"
"It looks like the Q2 results will end the sideway move of the stock price.There is a good chance we'll see $700 price soon after Q2 earning announcement.Remember. get in, think long, ignore short term noises, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."
Monday 28th June is Elon’s birthday  let’s get this post to the top to show our love  Go Tesla 
5 star buy
"Looks like Ford is in the cat bird's seat, since the new infrastructure bill does not grant new tax incentives to GM or Tesla, while Ford buyers are still eligible for the full $7,500. $TSLA"
There is a good chance we'll get way above $700 price by the end of this week. Cheers
"$TSLA's market cap is = Toyota + VW + BMW + Daimler, combined, yet its 2020 vehicle sales were only 2% of theirs. Here's what they all disclose, yet $TSLA still refuses to: -warranty expenses-Regional volumes, revenues & profits-Forex impact (important if you export a lot)-Incentive spend-raw material costs-and on and on"
"Nasdaq is green but TSLA is red. TSLA under-performs even on Nasdaq strong dates. Smart traders are downloading their shares to bag holders. One day, you will see it be cut in half on some Black Swan event. Like fraud been exposed. Elon facing jail time etc."

"If the pattern (that has made me a #$%$ load of money) continues, TSLA share price will creep up, to and slightly beyond earnings report. But once the ER is deciphered, the big drop occurs. I'm not suggesting anyone trade on my previous and reoccurring windfalls (don't want any of your losses on my conscience) but I must say: ""It sure has worked for me"". Disclaimer: I will be holding a short position at close day of ER. Good luck ( since fundamentals not longer apply with Tesla) to all..."

I donate that 3% to Tesla as long as I keep making money we are growing and spacex gets to the ducking moon
Buy if goes little down !!!
Tsla true value is less than $11 per share. Strong sell rating.
"only reason for the dump is some country's policy about Crypto causing massive liquidation before its too difficult to covert back to fiat in that same country, All it did was make Crypto stronger than before and more profitable for those who accumulated at the low point that’s why trading with and accurate and secure strategies are the best . I trade on Telegram with __RitaspenserFx"
Tesla added a Ford to its market cap in the last two days in spite of the fact that Ford has a much a better EV truck to offer and a seven motor Mach E that Elon Musk is afraid to race in his Plaid. Very sad!
"Sponsored Post: You must be overjoyed as Tesla was named the top performer in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 today. Anyway, let's get into the details of how these other sectors explored the mining industry! https://prem.li/UncoveringModernExplorationPotentials Numerous advanced-stage gold exploration projects were said to be currently underway along the district-scale shear zone of these other sectors. Check the disclaimer on the landing page."
Okay so everyone knows that Tesla has no demand because that's what the bears here always tells us but the question is then why is Tesla telling me that if I order a Model 3 or Model Y today that it would take 3+ months to be delivered? With no demand why don't they just deliver the car in < 2 weeks?
"Time to get more puts guys !!! it is like 80minutes left , and it is friday! The huge drop is coming !! Get some puts and collect the free bag of money !!! GL"
"Anyone else think it's hilarious that the company that got booted from S&P 500, to make room for TSLA, has out performed Tesla, 40% to 5%. Blew a sip of an expensive nice California red blend out of my nose after reading that news..."
Why is Tesla up today?
spxu up huge as stock bubble popping due to covid variant
"We are approaching the end of the quarter...what a surprise that Enron Musk tweeted about Bitcoin.. just weeks of earnings reports. Bitcoin holdings would have shown a massive loss as it was trading below the average price estimated (34.7k). A sign that the core of the business is not doing well, otherwise you wouldn't depend on the price of bitcoin to cover the profit gap. Most manipulated stock ever in history. This will not end up well."
Shorts are in trouble. What will tomorrow and next week bring? It looks like it is going to be over $700.
Tesla has no future unless they start opening restaurants at their charging stations.
Good news coming to TSLA - cannot wait to see some short shorts for the summer! Beach wear short shorts that is! Buy any dips- thank me later!
"Remember, from the news? Elon Musk says $TSLA was just a month away from bankruptcy while it ramped up production of the Model 3. Tesla was just one month from bankruptcy as it ramped up production of the Model 3 electric vehicle between mid-2017 and mid-2019, CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Tuesday.Ape power! $AMC $WISH $WKHS"
"I’ve had my 2021 model 3 for about 3 weeks now . Over 3.5k miles already . Can’t get over it still , such a fun car.!"
"If TSLA sells 210,000 vehicles this quarter, TSLA will be over $900. per share"
I wonder if Musk is getting pressured to step down as CEO?
when does TSLA report is quarterly production numbers this month?
"very nice, wanted 2-3% but got a little more"
Just sold all my calls - OMG I am so lucky! $30K loss this morning and I am even now!
Let's recall 900!!

"Tesla: ""The software fix in many instances will be made online"". Many? Musk being Musk."
"The recall includes 35,665 imported Model 3 vehicles and 249,855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in Tesla's factory in Shanghai. Customers will not be required to return the vehicles. Instead, they will receive a free software update either remotely or in-person to resolve the issue."

"compared any EV and AV makers, TSLA cheapest than anyone, so buy TSLA can make a lot of money."
"Pro Tip, short sellers lost billions more on the electric-vehicle maker than any other company in 2020, as bears got severely burned by the stock's surge to new highs. With shares up over 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to data from S3 Partners."
"Lets go Tesla bulls, buy and hold. Ignore the paid shills on here. They don't even own shares but they are on here offering their so expert advice..NOT!!"
"Hey shorts, how are you? :-D Still waiting for TSLA bankruptcy?"
"If this pushes past 690, it will run to 800 quickly."
A good short squeeze today!
"So many false news around tsla. Even in America, GM, Ford and CNBC and yahoo financial are all against Tesla. Why???Tesla is trying to clean the earth and yet the gas companies are paying billions of dollars into CNBS and yahoo to SLAM Tsla. Come on man!!!!!!! Do you want dirty energy??????"

"Tesla to open Super Chargers to all paying customers, as a revenue generator. That's got to just tickle pink all current Tesla owners, especially those with lifetime charging. Remember back when Musk said charging will NEVER be for profit, put just be a perk to Tesla owners? You've been played the fool."

My fellow Shorts.It’s time for us to stop thinking Tesla is only a car company.Look at the obvious: their 2 other biggest businesses:- Credits sale to other car makers- Bitcoin gambling.
We all know where this one is going. 
where are the bears? dead already?
"Why is Tesla trying to sell used 2018 Model 3's on it's website, for more $5K more than a new equally equipped 2021?"
When’s steering wheel day?
Seems like every 3rd car I see is a Tesla.
TSLA to $750 Monday close
"I no longer think Tesla is going bankrupt. I used to. That said, it's valuation makes little sense. At its current valuation, it would need almost the entire market. However, in places where there is significant competition, Tesla is not dominating. Not to the level it's valuation suggests it should."
"My Tesla was supposed to be delivered in August but now pushed back to September. Not mad, actually happy that is prove how strong the demand is."

see you in the 700s next week
Tesla has cars made in China and California. Soon to be in Germany and Texas! Soon to be in Africa and India.
Tesla Share price will be folded MASSIVLY down.Recalls and growing pressure by Chinese government and no position within top 20 among all automakers sales…..And no profits or ridicolous manipulated profits with bitcoin speculations and certificates sales…And this by a pe of 700 and marcet cap with a multiplie of 25 in comparison to other automakers?Hey guys….follow Michael bury and sell your shares quickly….the competition and battery eruption by quantumscape will disrupt Tesla and share price will go down to 70 usd..This is the fair value and equal to other automakers.
"TSLA longs who cite AMZN as an example to ""prove"" that TSLA is a sound investment even when trading at 600 times earnings, remind me of lottery ticket buyers that imagine regular purchases of lottery tickets are a good way to build up wealth because of all the example of people who won the jackpot."
How do we lose $13 in minutes on no news?
"Traded between $643 and $649 today, this will close at $645."
Is it true Tesla is going to spin off its Carbon Credit business? Ha ha ha - I would invest in THAT!!!
"I bought yesterday and woke up this morning with 300,000 vehicles being recalled. My luck"
was the news about self driving cars
"Tesla is yanking cars away from expecting owners, so they can be delivered to buyers closer to Fremont, just in time for Q2 credit. Imagine expecting your Model Y next week, but you wake up to find a new delivery date in September (and a different VIN#). Tesla owners are so into S&M."

I plan to buy Tesla when it comes back below $100. The tittle of No.1 in EV has been withdrawn by China Gov.
"Tesla is going to be slaughtered both fairly and unfairly and the simple reason is advertising $$. When Tesla was a cult the Fan Boys and Elon's manipulative tweets kept the interest high (while simultaneously no other car company was out there advertising EVs), now it's changed and Tesla is at a massive disadvantage: other major car companies have advertising divisions that are fully developed and very effective! .... as a matter of fact they also advertise in ""Car and Driver"" while Tesla does not. Car and Driver (or most all of the other major auto publications) will favour those companies that help pay their bills, like all other major car companies ""Except Tesla"" ... so the solution is for Tesla to advertise ? A: Yes! and NO! Tesla's business model is flawed ---> it does not account and set aside money for advertising whereas the other majors do and are spending it now. So Tesla goes down a bit as they go up a bit in value because of that one simple (but major) factor"
"Expect TSLA above 700 today. heading 750 today. Also, BAP will keep correcting with a short squeeze to at least 125 today. By Friday 150. ANBN and Z are the new summer correction stocks. Expect at least 30% correction this Summer."

Good morning shorts 
"Per an article I just read on Barron's, Tesla IS required to include its bitcoin losses as part of its Q2 financials, and Barron's estimates those losses to be about $90M. The good news is that the $90M loss will be offset by Model S sales. Or conversely, the bad news is that a big chunk of Model S earnings will be negated by bitcoin loss. Nice gamble, Elon. (Look for Elon to pump Bitcoin between now and June 30 to desperately reduce Q2 loss)"
Target $800
"700^ today, it just feels right."
"YTD EV sales in Europe VW 77,373 Tesla 29,702"

TSLA short interest as of 6/30/2021 is DOWN! 5 million to just 34 million shares. Short covering has been pushing the price of this dog up.Short interest was over 61 million a year ago.
"It’s amazing to me that almost all comments are negative, bearish and worse. In addition the press is almost universally beating up Tesla. Any accident anywhere is earthshaking as if car crashes only happen to TSLA. Just wait and see what will happen in the next couple of years. We are at the cusp of major positive developments. Stock at 1000 within two years. Be patient"
"Cramer will be the next catalyst for TSLA stock to Moon. They guy is betting his mothers house, big time short..."

"the funny part is that some of the teslaoon clowns are claiming on Twitter that they own large % of their portfolio in Tesla and have retired young on profits from Tesla but they are owning stock on margin. Thankfully, when Tesla swoons, they can be taking a new job washing cars in the ghetto after any of their ""equity"" in the Turdsla investment dries up and they start getting margin calls."
"The Endurance's hub motor technology means less repairs, less maintenance, no more oil change, no transmission fluid to replace, none to repair etc. The 80 mph lock can be changed by fleet owners.

"Tesla is updating software for it’s cars in China and It does not fall in the category of recalls. It’s just an software updates for certain features of the cars. Like iPhone updates or msft updates and so on. Are they recalls !? NO , they are not. Shorts are using the recall word to create a sell off. Smart investors should not sell on this fake news."
Pumping it up...could go to a thousand this time around. FED is losing control and they gonna print a whole lot more... but the thing is what will you buy if groceries go up 300% and Tesla only 100%?
Any thoughts what price target this TSLA rally is headed?
No EV tax rebate in Bidens plan unfortunately
Wonder what Elon Musk has to say about Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge)
$TSLA $TWLO $WIMI Be careful cause they might start covering a little or let this run up to get paper hands/ and tired investors to sell to get out. Which could backfire on them. Stay strong everyone! The plan remains the same.. BUY AND HODL!!

Likewise world demand for oil is returning and at near all time highs. It is expected to increase this year.Don't worry - OPEC is going to increase production by ~ 1.1 MBPD.Non-OPEC producers will almost double that increase - adding 2.1 MBPD. Now you can return to your delusional ""peak oil"" fantasy."

It will probably go up after deliveries and down after earnings again lol.
Are you buying?

MANGO THE BEAR!! I see you ;)
"With competition Tesla is struggling. No wonder it has production capacity of more than 1.25M and will sell less than 650k in 2021. Just see Europe - No 8 ranked for 2021 EV sales. Imagine this competition coming to Europe. - Production capacity 500k Shanghai, > 750k in Fremont but will ship <650k this year. Why is that?- Demand is down, flat - Europe and China sales in trouble. Europe with increased competition and China with bad quality, media and CCP.- No new catalyst. Plaid is marginal model upgrade. Plaid+ cancelled- 4680 cell problems lead to Plain+ cancelled and puts Cybertruck in jeopardy. No wonder truckling head at Tesla quit.- Autopilot is unusable with Radar removed. Forget Robotaxis (longs dont talk about this anymore). Autopilot and autosteer driver assist features are in serious trouble.. accidents will be sad.- Elon distracted with memes, coins, SpaceX and more. Trouble with SEC?- NHTSA & SEC stricter in this administration.. will have consequences."
Let’s gooo ….$720 tomorrow
"can it break 700 today, what do you think?"
Tesla China Q2 sales down 9% in a market that has grown by almost 40%.
What will Tesla do when it can no longer sell energy credits to keep afloat?
WallStreetBets will be all over TSLA in the coming days and weeks. This will create an avalanche of short squeeze and will propel the price higher. Dr Michael Burry will be paying more to cover his short position.
