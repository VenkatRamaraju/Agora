"After spending several hours further researching Tesla and its competitors, I am doubling my position today to 40 shares. It seems to me that this company: a) is much more than a car maker, with excellent technology and brain power to expand its profit in several other areas, and b) is so much in front of legacy car makers in EV technology that it is anywhere between scary and embarrassing. Tesla is on its way to become a dominant car maker on a planetary scale, but with a huge profit margin. Imagine Porsche but much, much bigger. Plus, it will lead the way on several huge businesses (battery production for all sorts of use; autonomous drive; solar technology; AI in all its applications; energy production; energy distribution, I am sure I forger a couple) each one of which is a huge business worldwide. Short sellers should, in my eyes, be aware that, whilst the big price oscillations will give them opportunity for profit if they are lucky or very cold-blooded, they are swimming against the tide as this company will grow massively in the years to come."
"GAAP vs Non-GAAP MetricsMusk’s financial creativity extends to financial reporting, as Tesla prefers to focus on non-GAAP methods rather than GAAP standards. In a February 2016 communication to shareholders, the company focused on a novel financial measure known as core operational cash flow, a pro forma methodology that adds cash from leasing company sales to cash from operations.The result was a positive $179 million, as opposed to GAAP measures of free cash flow at negative $441 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that companies focusing on non-GAAP metrics provide comparisons to GAAP methods, but Tesla omitted this step in its fourth quarter letter.As of Aug. 2018, Musk said Tesla was to post a profitable second half to 2018. Even still, the company posted a $3.06 loss per share. The company has been raising capital to fund production and capital expenditures (CAPEX). This has left a large debt overhang. The company had just $1.4 billion in cash as of 2Q 2018, excluding customer deposits. In Nov. 2018, it has a $230 million convertible bond payment. Then there's a $920 million bank loan due in March 2019.Sales, Earnings and Operating LossesWith the 2016 launch of its Model X, Tesla exhausted more than $400 million in cash per quarter through 2015 before a single unit of the sports utility vehicle was delivered. Actual sales of the Model X came in at 13,120 for 4Q 2017, while the Model S made up the balance of the 15,200 vehicles. As sales failed to meet expectations, 2017 fourth-quarter net loss of $3.04 per share (non-GAAP). Its GAAP loss $4.01.Vehicle Concerns and CompetitionTesla vehicle owners relayed a plethora of issues involving design and build quality. This includes malfunctions with the drivetrain and charging equipment. Tesla owners noted that response and repair time exceeded expectations, but, as the vehicles age, mechanical failures outside of the warranty period project significant expense for consumers.In an Aug. 2018 note, UBS said that the Model 3 would remain unprofitable, even with the Long Range battery pack. UBS says it’ll be losing $5,900 per car. That’s at the base model price of $35,000. The Model 3 is Tesla’s version of the electric car for the masses."
I heard about TSLA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
This is the greatest con of a generation. So they may deliver 1 million cars in a year? VW manufacturers roughly 10 million a year and the company is worth a fraction.
((( New solar fees as high as $60/month proposed by utilities across CA ))) The money has to come from somewhere.
Cathy pumped the stock and sold some shares. that's the game these days.
"After all the smack talk from legacy automakers and flimsy startups on EV, the truth is becoming clear. They are struggling with production and sales. Investors are again coalescing again around TSLA as the only profitable EV producing company (without credits). They are a decade ahead of anyone else in development, production and sales."
"I gotta say, if you drive around the Bay Area and any given hour you will see trucks loaded with Teslas shipping out from the plant.

Tesla moat is like a toddler swimming pool. We now know that the EV leader will be no higher than third to bring a EV truck to market. My guess is Ford will beat them also. How many years are they ahead of Legacy auto makers? https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a37258128/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed/
"Since there is certain boasting to how many miles of range is attainable per hour of charge for full EVs, I decided to pay a little closer attention to my refuel time today.2 minutes 35 seconds to top off a tank with 14.73 gallons that ranged 444.4 milesThat equates to ~172 mile range per minute (not per hour).This is just one gas pump and each one will of course vary in flow rate, but just thought I would speak in terms of the EV followers that boast about charge times vs. range in EVs."
Funny how many bashers and shorts remain! They say Tsla doesn’t make enough cars .... Tsla isn’t worth the valuation. They obviously don’t get Tsla and the never will. That’s why the longs will get richer and the shorts will continue to lose.
time to pump...where have the days of +5% ah pumping gone to?
"I hope many of you bought the $600 dip......This is a bargain. Understand the motive behind the oil price drop. They are trying to compete with the eventual adoption of EVs. They realize the EVs threat is going to come faster than even they expected. Proof: Tesla continues expansion into China and German factory locations. But here's the biggest IMO: in April 2020, $TSLA will hold their Battery Day event and I expect Tesla to announce their accomplishments over the past year since they acquired several technologies to help improve battery range dramatically. We could see a 30% improvement in range in Tesla vehicles coming out after April and on top of that, we will see a reduction for price to drop below $100 per kilowatt hour. This will be huge. I believe TSLA pps will go from today's low of $600 drive the price up past $1000. The oil sellers realized they don't have much time left as profits will drop significantly for them within 3-5 years as the world will have a massive EV transition. 5 years is what I give all other auto manufacturers to finally have EV models that will also be successfully selling to compete with TSLA to a degree, but this will be a bigger blow to the oil industry....not kill it.....but significant pain to their profits. In the past couple of weeks, you had one of the biggest auto makers announce they are fully committed to EVs more than ever....GM. Oil saw this too and after they had their emergency meetings to deal with a crisis that will start for their industry sooner than they expected, they foolishly decided cutting oil prices will help scramble for as much profits as possible for the few years left for them to take advantage of their monopoly over the auto industry. Buy $TSLA with a target of $1500+ and $NIO to $16+. You will regret missing out today's low of $600 TSLA and $3.00 on NIO. Keep buying and holding."
Wedbush maintains a $220 target price on TSLA through Q3 earnings. Says Tesla will struggle to reach the bottom end 360K deliveries for 2019. Also says that a China ramp will be all they talk about on the cc.

"I wonder if ARKK is buying more today? Does anyone know whether they have been selling into this downdraft? I will track the number for tomorrow to see. Their Tesla holdings are at 11% of assets (3,435,248) this morningGuru."
"Was Goldman right on the money? '“We have also updated our model to reflect the company’s price changes throughout the lineup and the likely negative impact to margins,” Osborne said in a note to clients Friday. He has an underperform rating on the stock and cut his price target to $180 from $200, implying around 34 percent downside risk from the current share price.'Looks like $180 it is after all."
How is it reported last week in China Tsla stopped production because of chips but today says sales are up in China talk about manipulation
I hope Wood has a strong insurance against fraud.
You know it occurred to me just now that Elon is only 2 years older than I. This is important because when I was a kid I saw the original 'total recall' and it blew me away. What did that film feature?1. Colonize Mars2. Robo taxis. I'm guessing that movie made quite the impression on Musk...he even talks a bit like Ahnold.
"Why Tesla will Fail in ChinaChina uses Tesla to spur on its own EV innovation and growthChina has NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto and dozens of new EV companies that will one day rival Tesla sales within China. While a huge first comer Tesla will eventually begin to lose market share globally as these Chinese native EV makers rise to prominence. This is how business and innovation works and China in the end will favor its own companies. This is why a Government deal saved NIO, making its stock go from $2 to $35. China will use Tesla to bolster its own companies, while giving Tesla a fair place in China to spur innovation.Just as with Apple phones, eventually the native Chinese brands catch up. Already at the end of 2020 the writing is on the wall of how this slowly begins to occur. NIO doubled sales recently. Xpeng delivered 3,040 vehicles, up 229% from less than 1,000 vehicles a year earlier. While both are companies likely 5 years behind Tesla, Chinese markets and money will push them higher.Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto are just a trio of companies in the sector but there are others. China will win the green tech race. BYD, BAIC, there are literally dozens of others. Really good companies, totally unknown in the West. Tesla can win because of its brand image, but all things made in America don’t shine in the future. A future where Chinese companies will rule innovation."

"Article from an Expo/Conf including heavy EV trucksQuotes here from the Peterbuilt exec regarding the market would seem to justify Tesla's decision to make Class 8 EV trucks. The article is also a good report on the development and commercial status of large electric trucks and required infrastructure in the US. California is also supporting EV trucks because of easily polluted, over populated Southern California. The report was generated from the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo in Long Beach, California. IMHO, we might hope that Tesla could get a few units out there in daily service even without the latest batteries for feedback into development. https://news.yahoo.com/act-expo-peterbilts-math-lesson-143157937.html"

The engineering isn't even complete. The manufacturing techniques aren't invented yet. So when Musk showed off the CyberTruck years ago and began taking reservations, how was that any different than Nikola pushing a non-functional semi down a hill and proclaiming - ""It works!"" Total fraud. Even if Tesla shocks the world and actually hits a revised deadline by delivering a few CTs in 2022, mass production won't start until 2023 at the earliest."

Yet Musk also says the robotaxi business will boom and car utilization will increase by multiples. Don't these two predictions contradict each other? If car utilization increases by 5x, that means car market is 1/5 what it used to be. So how are they going to sell 30m cars a year when the worldwide car market contracts to 15 million cars because of FSD?"

Do you think Tesla will continue being the best electric vehicle? I can imagine a time in the future when a Tesla is considered outdated
"At first glance, such a goal seems unrealistic. Tesla has promised energy consumption of “less than 2 kWh per mile“, and some analysts have therefore based their analysis on an assumption of 2kWh per mile. Indeed the battery size to achieve this would take away an unacceptable amount of payload. A 500 mile range and 2 kWh per mile means 1000 kWh of battery capacity. Assuming an energy density of 160 Wh/kg (consistent with current Tesla pack densities, see here and here) means the battery pack would weight 6,250 kg, or almost 14,000 lbs. A typical tractor-trailer combination weighs roughly 35,000 lbs empty (see here and here), leaving a maximum payload of about 45,000 lbs. Thus, in the simple analysis, the battery would eat up about 30% of the truck’s payload, rendering it in all likelihood uncompetitive. https://faculty.washington.edu/dwhm/2018/02/26/does-the-tesla-semi-defy-the-laws-of-physics/"
"Despite bears frequently saying that Tesla only has strong margins on Model S and Model X (which they sold almost none of in Q1 due to a transition period in production to the refreshed editions), gross margins on automotive revenue came in at 26.5% and 22% minus regulatory credits, both numbers nearly the highest in the company's history. Still going to say that Tesla doesn't have any profit margins on Model 3 and Model Y? How did they almost beat their own record without almost any help from S and X this time?"
"4 days ago, in premarket, I posted that we would see a time of swings, not only in the general market, but in TSLA specifically.

So today in premarket, after trading as low as $510 yesterday afternoon in after hours in the U.S. , we see TSLA trading above $600 this morning in premarket $604 as of the time of starting this post, surprise, surprise, ""amazingly"" near the LDV or ""maxpain"" option expirations strike for TODAY""s march 13 option expiration. But I am not buying any big rallies in TSLA or the general market , ""just yet"" Next week, march 20, the LDV's for TSLA and the SP500 DIVERGE, this is important. The LDV's for next weeks general market are for higher prices whereas for TSLA it is for lower prices, and for BOTH, it is a big quarterly expiration, a truly huge open interest dollar amount riding on the option expirations. So it is likely that we will continue to see large swings , it certainly is going to be interesting."

Henceforth, we'll drop all the FSD hardware from low-end cars to make them more affordable. Like Mercedes, we'll only offer FSD on our high-end cars to the 1% who can afford it. 7) Honestly, Teslas cannot even navigate that one-lane Las Vegas tunnel without a driver. 8) If I'm being really honest, well, we are 10-20 years away from L5 autonomous driving, if that. 9) Finally, our stock is way overvalued."
"Since Tesla's current bonds are priced at 84 center on the dollar, it would seem pretty obvious that they are going to have a very tough time selling new bonds. Their chances of increasing any bank line of credit is also highly unlikely. If they were to attempt to go to the bond market it is almost impossible to determine at what rate they would be able to sell bonds. Therefore, their only option left would be to sell additional shares of stock causing substantial dilution and depressing the stock further.Also, it is estimated that Musk has a substantial number of shares being used as collateral and if the stock were to drop much further, he could be forced to start selling to cover margin requirements."

I calculate around $3 billion more would give them the operating capital they'll need to get them into 2019 -- and it's only around $3 billion IF the Model 3 is selling extremely well providing a significant revenue stream."
Just got off the phone with my wife. I think we are going to go buy a new vehicle this weekend. Kind of a spur of the moment thing. Had talked about maybe trading in a for a while now but never did anything. So we are going to go to the dealer that we trade with all the time this Saturday morning and will most likely drive home with a new SUV this Saturday morning. Can you do with Tesla?

"While Tesla certainly appears to have the potential to be the ""big tech"" of the future, and I like it's products, the problem is that it already has this ""future"" valuation now. And the problem with this, is that inflation is continuing to increase, which is going to eat into this ""future valuation."" Facebook and Amazon were not worth even close to what Tesla is when they had similar revenues and profits. They traded in the +/- 50B range which is where Tesla should be. I think Tesla will become a big tech player but it's not there yet...despite the hype"

"Interesting valuation trend for assets ..Bitcoin and other crypto's now reaching $2 trillion valuation as compared to all the farmland and buildings in America at $2.7 trillion. There is an unlimited supply of crypto currencies and but little new productive farmland is being created. Tesla is valued at 1000 PE yet the majority of their available models are in multiyear sales decline. The fed is pumping Trillions into the economy and inflation is ramping up in response. Highly leveraged hedge funds are flirting with disastrous margin calls . Pent up demand, pandemic relief are lining up for a roaring 20's set up similar to the 1920's explosion following the 1918 Spanish flue pandemic. Hold on to your horses, things are getting weird. Renewable power generation is now touching 20% of all the power generated in the USA, yet there is a belief of much higher proportions . The EIA shows 20% Nuclear, 20% combined wind, hydro, and utility solar withe the remainder of grid power from fossil fuels. Coal still accounts for over 20% of the power produced in the USA. Make no mistake this is changing and the rate of change is increasing, but we are not there yet. The move to EV's will enable integration of wide ranging power storage options as a smart grid. The next 10 years will be very interesting. Is another world war on the horizon, is it bliss and progress, civil war due to left and right wingnuts or will the center majority emerge and engage to rein in the wingers........... Will Tesla earn its valuation or be re-priced. You tell me?"

Instructions for becoming a millionaire: Take $1 billion and invested all in Tesla
Tesla doesn't know how to make a FSD car.Recently - they patched the SW to version 9.2 within days they admitted it was flawed Recently - they promised to fix 9.2 with two patches in near futureRecently - they removed radar from **some*** Model 3s but not all.Recently - they promised another patch - 10 Beta Recently - they promised to create another HW version This is all smoke and mirrors. If they knew how to make a FSD car they would make one.

Would you believe one analyst's target price is $40 (while average of all analysts is $359) - would this analyst change his target price or stick with $40?

"Elon Musk: ‘This is craziest month of deliveries Tesla (TSLA) will ever have’Elon Musk told Tesla (TSLA) employees that “this is the craziest month of deliveries Tesla will ever have.”The CEO stated that Tesla is again trying to stop its draining end-of-quarter delivery pushes, but he expects a big one this quarter.Tesla has been known to have intense end-of-quarter delivery pushes due to its distribution system, which is very different from other automakers that use third-party dealerships.Since Tesla sells directly to customers, the automaker owns the vehicle until it is fully delivered to the buyer and paid for.It results in transit times being extremely important for Tesla financially since the automaker takes on the cost of building those cars and doesn’t get any money until the customers can actually pick them up.Therefore, when Tesla has a lot of vehicles in transit at the end of a quarter, the quarter looks bad for them financially.It’s why Tesla tries to build vehicles for exportations at its Fremont factory and Gigafactory Shanghai early in the quarter and vehicles for local deliveries later in order to allow for transit time by the end of the quarter.However, this strategy results in Tesla’s sales and delivery team having to handle significant volumes of vehicles to deliver toward the end of each quarter, which are called “delivery waves” or “delivery pushes.”CEO Elon Musk has previously indicated that Tesla is aiming to reduce those waves since they put a lot of stress on employees and have been known to affect customer experience.It has yet to happen and it will certainly not be this quarter, but it might finally end relatively soon.Last night, Musk held a company-wide call with Tesla employees where he told them to expect a “crazy” end of the quarter, according to sources on the call who spoke with Electrek.The CEO said:“This month will be the craziest month for deliveries Tesla will ever have.”Production issues due to the chip shortage and logistical issues due to bottleneck at ports as well as more recently natural disasters in the US have delayed deliveries for Tesla.Those issues will add to the usual strain of the end-of-quarter delivery wave, and it will make the next few weeks extremely important and challenging in terms of deliveries for the quarter.The silver lining is that Musk claimed that it’s not only going to be the craziest month for deliveries Tesla ever had but also will ever have.The CEO believes that Tesla should get a better handle on its logistics, and he aims for the automaker to put a stop to those delivery waves by Q4 2021 or Q1 2022.It coincides with the ramp-up of production at Gigafactory Berlin, which is expected to start production in October.Tesla delivers a lot of vehicles in Europe, and those vehicles are currently coming by ships from the US and China.If the automaker can make some of those locally, it will reduce transit times for those vehicles and free up more production capacity for a steadier supply of vehicles for local deliveries in China and North America.Good luck and GOD bless,"
"Recently, Goldman Sachs upgraded $TSLA to a buy, and gave a new price target of $780 based on improved long term sales outlook. The only thing I disagree with is the price target. I feel $890 by EOY is more accurate."

"I can do in seconds on the computer, what it would have taken dozens of file clerks, 70 years ago, to do in days. I can travel in a car in hours, what it would have taken days to accomplish if traveling 100 years ago. The computer and car were truly revolutionary technology -- and some of the companies involved in that revolution profited tremendously. Going from a gasoline-powered car to a battery-electric one, does NOT involve any similar ""revolution"" in technology because there is no significant efficiency gains that result in substantial time-saving for the technology user. Subsequently, while it is possible for an electric car manufacturer to earn a profit, one should not be expecting the levels of profitability such as that seen with real disruptive technology examples from the past."
"My investment thesis since I went long $TSLA in 2019 has been that as global EV adoption soars from 3% in 2020 to 24% by 2025 (+50%+ CGR), and TSLA just holds its EV share at ~25%, TSLA EPS explodes to $30 by 2025, worth $1,500 at a 50x P/E in 2025, which is worth $1,000 today."

It has been reporting earnings nonstop, made over $1billion in GAAP earnings and it will do so on 3rd quarter.

"Tesla's mission statement is ""to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy"". So I have a difficult time with the disparagement of their earning results. They are profiting on the transition to sustainable energy which includes emission credits, ev car credit(all automotive companies get when they produce evs). Business is business. I don't see anyone jumping up and down on exploration credits to oil companies or r&d credits for most companies. That is just business/cash flow. Cars are a part of their business but it is only one component related to the overall mission to sustainable energy. Seems like they are executing toward their mission statement. Also, if you are cherry picking the emission credits as having some sort of lessor quality revenues, then you have to discount some of the one time only compensation expenses. The only disheartening issue from the quarterly conference call was FSD. It looks like it is going to take a little longer than believed but their development process is nothing short of genius. These guys are moving forward like a freight train they won't be stopped."

"Today the concept of ""market saturation"" finally registers on TSLA bulls. It's increasingly clear that every new market experiences an initial surge of sales, after a while the sales surge ends as suddenly as it began. Then the resale market is sufficient to satisfy whatever ""new demand"" may occur.Presently TSLA's largest market, the USA, is experiencing ""market saturation"" with large inventory of both new and resale Model S and Model X………the Model 3 has entered this saturation phase just recently; observe sales numbers to confirm this phenomenum."

Every stock has a price where it becomes a sound investment. For Tesla it just happens to be negative
What ever they will report: Tesla remains a profit underperformer. What would be exciting about a dollar quarterly profit at $700 stock value? The most overhyped stock ever.
So they sold 20000 more cars than expected and the market cap goes up by $30 billion.. seems legit..

"Battery day was a positive and realistic discussion of potential improvements. People expected red meat. they wanted electric airplanes, a hovering Roadster, and 1,000,000 mile batteries. That's not what they got. The hazard of hype is that good news sounds disappointing. Elon brings this on himself but it is the fans who drive expectations to irrational levels.Nevertheless I did hear a Bunch of ""We're working on it,"" as opposed to ""We've done it."" We have all heard countless stories of breakthrough batteries that for one reason or another fail to come to production. Musk saying the entire metals industry doesn't know what they are doing was as cringe-worthy as his past claim that air resistance would be the only thing holding his assembly robots back."

"'A very big deal': Federal safety regulator takes aim at Tesla Autopilot. What is slower: Investigation of the safety of Tesla's AP/FSD even changing system, or design of a road worthy Cyber Truck?"
I'll never sell my TSLA shares until ride share is implemented and rakes in billions. Target 2030.
as the market crashes...this will rise...go millennials
"$TSLA 's P/E=1200, Market Value alone is more than the overall market capitalizations in 120 countries!The US Stock Market is a Fraudulent system!Tesla fair market value is $20 Billion."
"I don't plan on posting any disparaging comments regarding Tesla nor Elon today, but I just wanted to post just this one, so that the perma-long sycophants have something to thumbs down. Going to be another flat TSLA day anyway. Cheers..."
"WOW the paid short posters have flooded this board for many days, who is paying them GM, NIO?do they know real investors do not listen to them?"
Cathie: Tesla is worth 3000$ Also Cathie: sells TSLA shares....
"People making such a big deal over TSLA being down 7% this week.NIO, VW and even GM are all down similarly. Between 6 and 7% over the same time period - and that's without anything new regarding the NHTSA."
"Its just getting started really. Giga Texas and Berlin open this quarter! Next phase of growth will be faster, bigger. Hold those shares or be disappointed later"
"The Most Overvalued US Stocks $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $NFLX and other MEGA BUBBLES will soon COLLAPSE by 55-80%, while the most undervalued stock KHC will Triple in value soon!"
Well the bad news is day 8 and still no refunds. I did however get an email and all new Tesla deliveries from this day forward will include the following really cool accessory. https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Radiation-Resistant-Aluminized-Fireproof/dp/B00R8WVSRC
"Major market crash is coming. ""Buffett indicator"" highest in 20 years . Buffett sold ALL his airline stocks, he said he made a mistake, corona changed the business."
"Tomorrow @ 2:30 pm CA time, the Q1 financial report.Will this be a third immaculate quarter, i.e. still losing money yet report profits? How many EV credits do they still have banked? Can they borrow against the expected future FCA emissions credit income? Can they again sell inventory to a 3rd party? Looks like the stock price is running up before the report. The connected might know something."
Ark investments announces it has started to buy shares for S&P.
"TSLA NFLX AAPL after split, OMG!"
Nasdaq futures are up. Cheap shares! Battery Day coming up!! Lets' get ready to RUMBLE!!!
So ...to those that hold the thesis that TSLA will be a $50 stock down the road because of too much competition between home and abroad...I see the logic...BUT...logic when it comes to cultish products doesnt always compute. Lets just look at Apple shall we? They said back when android first came into the market that Apple would be worth just a 10th. wher is Apple now? Tsla like apple isnt a regular company. its a religion. Fundamentals dont apply.
I think it’s been well-established that elect-tek is The official news leak for Tesla motor Corporation. With that being said I believe this leak of 3000 cars in inventory is essentially an earnings warning
"Many think $TSLA price will fall after S&P inclusion. ""I don't think so, mostly the reverse will happen""Now TSLA shares owns by ETFs & Funds..(not just some traders shorting).. no body wants their Fund or ETF price to go down or show poor performance.. for that reasons, ETFs & Fund managers try to push this stock price UP!!!I feel many fund managers cut down their holdings of $MSFT,$BA,$AAPL,$AMZN. to buy(include) $TSLA in their profiles."
"Bull are strong. Boarding and flight pass 725+ station to the moon, Tsla!"
$NIO way undervalued compared to $TSLA. Nio deliveries 2020. 17702 Tesla 178000. Ie 10 times....NIO market cap 25 billion Tesla 442 billion ie 18 times .....NIO stock price 20 dollars Tesla 475 ie 24 times higher. Not saying Tesla is over priced but am saying NIO is way underpriced when compared to Tesla. Both companies leaders in their future prospects Truly believe major upside for NIO compared to Tesla GLTA
"Is TSLA heading to bankruptcy, People, please advise"
"Short more, cover more! Bulls could load more TSLA tomorrow and fly up to $800+ zone."
Tesla October sales collapseMost amazing thing about the $TSLA 10-Q?:It proves the company can't generate a profit even under the most favorable circumstances.
"I am genuinely surprised that Saturday's Volume news only made a 1.5% bump today. We know sell the news, but I thought this would grow another 10% before Thursday earning call. I wonder how the product mix will be reflected onto the bottom line, as I suspect Tesla has been shipping cars globally from Shanghai and that is not cheap - OPEX must be going through the roof to do these numbers."
Every time a Tesla while being driven autonomously causes an accident the stock price goes up!
"Tesla - #TSLA to declare earnings on Wednesday, expecting a loss announcement of $3 per sharehttps://goo.gl/xEp5Lt"
"I read about and became interested in the ARK funds. Whilst doing my research on them, I saw that Tesla plays an important role in several of them. I was curious as I had never researched Tesla, considering it a producer of cars I don't like at a share price I like even less, and led by a boss whose tendency for hyperbole, exaggerations, untruths and assorted shenanigans is frankly off putting. As I researched the why ARK likes Tesla so much, I realised that this is so much more than a ""car company"". It is a technology company with huge capabilities in several key sectors of technological advance (batteries, processors), and deeply involved in some of the key technologies of the future (assisted driving and AI in general). I also learned about the dynamics of battery production, and how it influences Tesla's choices concerning car production. It seems to me that, whilst Tesla as a ""car maker"", and even a disruptive one with brilliant prospects, would not even remotely justify the current P/E ratio, Tesla as a technological innovator as a whole makes the price far more digestible and, in a way, easier to get to grips with. I have given an order for 20 at market for tomorrow. If the stock gets below 500 I will buy another 20 or, perhaps, even 30. I expect wild oscillations in future quarters as at that P/E (even if decreasing as the EPS goes up) every bump down the road will have a (temporary) major impact on the share price. Still, and as always, I choose this stock for the long haul (likely 15 years or more). I also note that the $680 stock looks way cheaper if compared to an expected (average analyst estimate according to MarketWatch) EPS of around $8.5 in 2023. Just multiplying the latest quarter's EPS ($1.45) by 4 you get a P/E ratio below 120. Still damn expensive, but on planet earth, and the profits are growing fast.Will there be bumps along the road? Sure! Do I believe Elon Musk's boasts and promises? Not a single one, at least as far timing is concerned! Do I think that he can deliver the goods in the end? It seems to me that he always has up to now, albeit always slower than he said he would. This is around 2% of my portfolio. I think it's a sensible move."

"Tesla’s super efficient BEV HVAC system will be expanded and adapted to multiple applications.It could eventually be even a bigger part of the company’s revenue growth than its BEVs, solar energy, and battery storage combined.Saw were people were sleeping in their Teslas for the better air during the bad wild fires in Northern California."

"$TSLA just announced production of 509,737 vehicles in 2020 and delivery of 499,550 (i.e., 98% sales of manufactured items)....wow. That represents 36% increase over previous year and 180,070 vehicles delivered in 4th quarter represents 30% increase over 3rd quarter deliveries. To the moon!!"
"Between 2017 and 2021, investors shorting Tesla lost $52 billion; when going back to 2010, the number is closer to $57 billion."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Tesla is unusual in the way it reports some of its key financial metrics. When calculating gross margins — the sales price of a car minus the direct costs of manufacturing — traditional carmakers include research, development and engineering costs. Tesla does not, which tends to make its margins look better."
"#LCID just got an EPA rating of 520 miles per battery charge, 100 miles more than it's leading competitor #TSLA. I'm very bullish on TSLA for autonomous reasons, but the car and battery competition in USA is ramping up. I own more LCID than TSLA right now."

"Tesla may be the largest Ponzi scheme ever in history. Just before the market crash, the share skyrocketed. Many investors had already gone short at 3x lower. Now they are forced to take a big loss. Giant gains and losses have been made."

"A short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals. A short squeeze can occur when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers covering (liquidating) their positions.[1]Short squeezes result when short sellers of a stock move to cover their positions, purchasing large volumes of stock relative to the market volume. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes a further rise in the stock's price. This newly increased price can in-turn trigger additional margin calls and short covering, which in turn may drive up the price further still in a vicious feedback loop. Short squeezes tend to happen in stocks that have expensive borrow rates. These expensive borrow rates can increase the pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, further adding to the reflexive nature of this phenomenon."

"Jim Collins on $TSLA capital raise: ""Those headlines should have read 'Tesla raises $2.7 billion to fund unnecessary hedging transactions, upcoming debt maturities and the necessary level of maintenance capital spending, leaving zero to fund growth.'"""
Guess we might find out the truth if FSD and robo taxis will be on the road by the end of this year.
"Fundamentals always prevail in the end.Now Tesla doesn't even have a vehicle to obtain capital to stay in business thru 2019They will be searching for a partner. Perhaps they are a buyout candidate when stock goes below $50, although that may exceed their book value"
"Yep $GS is on the wrong side of the $TSLA trade it appears. They are about to lose big. They are now essentially admitting that Q2 will beat expectations for sure. Now they are projecting the future q by q which was clearly wrong the last q. Of course with new company and disruptive tech, its hard to get to that reliable and stable place quickly. There is brand recognition (the cool factor) and there is demand. tesla is figuring out how to make cars cheaply and meet the demands, and manage the profitability. Mind you they are still increasing their productioncapacity for the foreseeable future"

"Still say anyone that hasn’t driven a Tesla (or more so owned one) is uniformed of nature of this extraordinary vehicle. Many of their comments and projections are conjecture. Sure they have their flaws but they’re correctable. Name one legacy ICE conveyance that hasn’t had significant recalls (many of them safety related). Really do hope they get their act together as the planet needs more EVs. The biggies are mostly basing their current profits on powerful ICE pickups and SUVs.On the California I 405:“In peak traffic, vehicle speeds average just 14 miles per hour, making for commutes longer than 45 minutes in the northbound lanes.” May 6, 2019That’s a lot of stop and go. EVs don’t idle. In the past 2 years bought for my 2016 GMC Terrane....fan belt, oil, filters, spark plugs, coolant, additives, smog check, emission parts, sensors, brake parts, battery and tune up labor. Not looking forward to repairing the brakes, exhaust system and emissions components. Hopefully others will make competitive BEVs and give Tesla a run for its money."
Tesla should acquire Microvision and then own and incorporate the very best lidar and AR technologies in the world.
"Elon Musk will co-star in the next James Bond franchise, as an evil villain that wants to take over the world, using his array of low earth orbit satellites to been down magnetic pulse ""lasers"" to disrupt cryptocurrency exchanges, and any military counter responses, at will.

"The Problem With Lending Tesla Money......Tesla burned $915 million in the fourth quarter, while increasing the company debt from $5.97 billion at the end of 2016 to $9.46 billion at the end of 2017. The company burned $1 billion in the first quarter of this year. It owes bondholders just under $10 billion.So the company bleeds money and bond investors might give them more cash? Hmm.What happens when Tesla’s competitors, like Jaguar with its new I-Pace, start putting cars on the road later this year?Those other guys have lots of money from profitable operations, and they make cars by the millions across their product lines, not just tens of thousands each quarter."

Another accident with some drunk trying to show off FSD. Except that this one was so drunk he didn't turn it on when he climbed into the back seat. He must have latched the driver's belt to fake out the car. His corpse had a blood alcohol level way over the limit. There was another story about some guy asleep going down a Freeway with the system turned on. He would likely have gone to sleep system or no system. Tesla may be right that Autopilot is saving many more people than it loses. But clearly some smart camera system has to be installed to monitor the driver. A Big Brother system is required until Level 5 is achieved at least and that won't be soon. https://www.thedailybeast.com/autopsy-suggests-fiery-tesla-crash-in-texas-wasnt-due-to-autopilot

"I took delivery of my model X P90DL late August. Have had nothing but problems! Having spent $148k on a car that feels cheaper then a Toyota Corolla, I can't even express my frustrations with how poorly built my model X is. I chose the mode x over a Porsche 911 turbo, - MB GL 63 AMG, and a few other cars. This was the most expensive car I have ever purchased and it is by far the worst built car ever. No way I would buy this car again! I am just wondering if anyone has been able to successfully return their car? I am speaking to 2 attorneys and considering filing a class action law suite against Tesla. It seems like every time I take my car i am told ""Tesla knew about this problem in production"". I know it is a new model and I have owned several first year models (including a 2009 GTR). None had the problems I am having. I appreciate any advice and help you all may be able to offer specially those who have successfully replaced or returned their vehicles! This car is my wife's car and she is quite upset. Here are my list of issues:-Falcon door alignment at day #1-driver window making loud noise fromNot sealing (replaced small window)-spoiler squeak (replaced spoiler first week of ownership).-all windows squeaking (still a problem)- problems with charge port not opening-problem with passenger door not closing with push button- falcon door squeaking- driver fender piece popping out randomly and having to push it in.-passenger front wheel well piece being loose and improperly installed at factory. - seat rail plastic cover falling off-door trim sticking out and popping off-SEVERE shaking upon full accelaerarion only (normal driving at any speed is fine. Just noticeable under full acceleration and most noticeable at lower speeds). This started after 2 wks of ownership. I have a few other items also but just sick of bugging my service manager. Very much regret getting this car and in all honesty, no way I can recommend this car to anyone and no way I would get this car again....specially at $148k and at best feels like a $10k car!I am just hoping someone out there can understand my anger and frustration and provide me with some guidance. I have lost all faith in Tesla and will be canceling my model 3 orders as well!"
"If you live in California, I can see why you see many Tesla Model 3s popping up.Approximately 30% of Model 3s built were registered and sold in California.

I compiled the data from Tesla Motors Club configuration spreadsheet.If you give me a state I can give you the percentage sold in that state."

"Zotye Auto, one of hot Chinese stock in auto sector, boasting solar power integration just went bankruptcy. They had excellent earnings report every quarter until now. It turns out many Chinese companies using a lot of shell companies to make the earnings reports look good. There are no accounting supervision in China.

"It is just a bit early for me to make a definitive view of the most likely shareprice dynamic after the earnings report is released. ( and I don't mean only in the first few minutes or hours but more centered on the period later, ie by the end of trading of next week and the following week etc. But since I have been correct on about 99 percent of TSLA reads in the last year or two, my view is very valuable information , as my followers can attest to. So I won't yet reveal my take, maybe I plain won't reveal it, but would it not be something if after all the emphasis being placed on this report etc, that after the typical gyration we always see with an event such as this, that after the dust settles, that the shareprice is not significantly different than the recent range, thus disappointing the extreme bears as well as the extreme bulls. Would that be something? So I ask the board, for their opinions . Following the earnings report , say by end of this month, will the shareprice be which of five options?1. less than 10 percent , up or down from the current price2. 10 percent or more up3. 10 percent or more down4. 20 percent or more up5.20 percent of more down. So experts of the yahoo finance TSLA board, chime in , let's hear your predictions......"
"How I know TSLA is not a Bubble:1.) Everyone laughed at AMZN when it passed Sears by Market Cap.2.) AMZN once had a P/E ratio of 3,000+3.) The cult of TSLA is like nothing I have ever seen before in my life. This is nothing like iPhone. This is another level. TSLA can raise money AT WILL. 4.) I’m sitting here without power in Texas wishing I had a power wall for energy storage. 5.) TSLA brings power back to the people. And takes it away from these 100+ year old companies (O&G) that a have failed to adapt to change. 6.) I spent most of my adult life in Oil & Gas & all the top Company Men/CEO’s I know say our days our numbered due to Big Government wanting Green Energy to prevail. ￼￼"
"Tesla files to expand Model Y production lines at Fremont factoryTesla plans to expand Model Y production lines at its Fremont factory in Northern California, filings submitted to the City of Fremont reveal.The Model Y is Tesla’s newest available vehicle and also the company’s most popular car in several markets, including the United States. The all-electric crossover is produced at the Fremont factory in Northern California on production lines known as General Assembly (GA) 4.5 and has been since February 2020. Tesla installed the GA 4.5 line just outside the Fremont plant’s main facility in a “spring structure,” or tent, which was also the home to some Model 3 production since February 2020.In February, Tesla officially filed to have the spring structure made permanent by filing with the City of Fremont to add a 64,000 square foot expansion to the factory. In July, Tesla officially started making GA 4.5 a permanent part of the company’s production facility by adding underground sewer connections for plumbing and creating foundational work for the spring structure to sit on.Tesla’s project to make GA 4.5 permanent at Fremont is underwayNow that the GA 4.5 lines are permanently installed in the factory, it appears that Tesla is attempting to expand the production capacity of these lines specifically. New filings from the City of Fremont reveal Tesla has filed for “4.5 Expansion,” along with several other filings, including “GA4.5 South Expansion Shell & Utilities,” and “GA4.5 Battery Marriage Tool Improvement.”Tesla has been making tremendous strides toward improving GA 4.5, especially as demand for the company’s vehicles has increased over the past few years. Tesla is currently struggling with keeping up with demand because it has just one operational plant in North America. Tesla has been able to avert production stoppages from semiconductor shortages by developing its own microcontrollers in-house. However, demand has pushed the projected delivery of some vehicles back to 2022.According to the company’s most recent Shareholder Deck, the Fremont factory currently produces 500,000 Model 3 and Model Y units per year. Because the two vehicles are Tesla’s most popular products, the company is working on expanding the production capacity to keep up with growing demand. Tesla will soon have assistance with Model Y production for North America as Giga Texas will begin manufacturing the all-electric crossover later this year. Additionally, Tesla’s global production rate of the Y will expand once again later this year when production at Giga Berlin, the company’s first European production facility, begins.Tesla has continued to dominate the EV market across the globe, and the Model Y is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, contributors to the cause. Expanding the manufacturing efforts of the Model Y is in Tesla’s best interest as it continues to battle through parts shortages and increasing demand for its vehicles.Good luck and GOD bless,"
im short 30 shares... heading to 600$
"Remember, ""It's not about building cars it's about building the factories that build cars""."
got only 30 shares at 400. waiting to add more since then. but it kept going up. what's a reasonable price to buy more? don't want to buy it at this crazy price. any reasonable strategy would be appreciated
Keep your shares!!! Stay patient! 1. S&P 5002. Battery day 3. Earnings in Late OctoberStay long!!!! $TSLA
It went green. About time for the longs to show up and start telling us how $400 is the next stop and what a great opportunity it is right now to buy at these low levels.
this stock is intact as tesla s future. Longs hold strong!!
The guy who shorted $TSLA at $100 in Feb 2020 is shorting $WKHS now. $TSLA went to $900 in Jan 2021. Isn't he a genius?

I heard people with cars on order have been delayed yet again. His car was supposed to be delivered in October and it's now delayed to February. This chip and parts shortage is causing major manufacturing problems.
"The most interesting takeaway:""Still, the top line tally of $6.3B relied on deferred revenue and was below expectations. It also marked Tesla's first annual sales decline since 2012."""
TESLA wants to sell electricity directly to customers in Texas according to an application filed this month with Public Utility Commission It would create a new Subsidiary of Tesla called Tesla Energu Ventures.The new initiative would follow Teslas recently reported move to built 2 giant mega batteries in Texas one at its factory near Austin under Construction and the other outside Houston under the plan kilowatts can be sold that are either drawn from the grid or pulled from Tesla made home batteries .

"Artificial intelligence requires two things: Massive amounts of data, and a powerful computer that can use that data to train deep neural nets. With over 1 million autopilot-enabled EVs on the road, Tesla already has an edge over other automakers. Now, with the introduction of DOJO, an exascale supercomputer, which management says will be operational next year, Tesla has reinforced that advantage. In short, the company has more data and better technology, meaning it's miles ahead in the race to build a self-driving car. And autonomy is the future of the automotive industry."

"If I were to be an optimist and assume that TSLA could produce four consecutive quarters as profitable as Q3 and Q4 of 2018, it would produce roughly an $800 million annual net profit. If a generous PE ratio of 25 were assigned to these earnings - this ratio is approximately 2.5x higher than that of the average automotive company - the resulting market capitalization would be $20 billion. However, TSLA's market cap is currently almost exactly 2x this generous value. Can any longs explain why TSLA deserves such a rich valuation?"
"Out for now. Been a good run tho. Competition ramps up in 2019 with pricey, high end hybrids and electrics starting popping up. I should think the green status symbol of Tesla passes to others, like Porsche/Audi/Jaguar. Possible anyway. Time to lock in the profits and watch for a bit, methinks"
"Tesla fans are going to LOVE this. It PROVES that BMW is the past, because they just don't ""get it."" Tesla will be the future! Yes, they'll have to restructure the debt first, but after that the sky is the limit. BMW is ceding the market to them! Europe rejects EVs says BMW"
Even the paid shills at CNBC are starting to see that Tesla has no competition.
"Tesla investor are whining about Tesla's decision to invest $1.5 billion in bitcoin. The $1.5 billion would have been sitting in the bank earninga a fraction of 1% or something relatively small for interest. With Bitcoi, $1.5 billion just made over 560 million yesterday. And what about from the time Tesla bought in January when it was only $34,000. The valuation it mades will show in the balance sheet as profit on next quarterly earnings. Bitcoin is risky and volatile but it starting to get support from big company and its times for Corporation to reap the profits of the liquid assets instead of the bank loaning their money to someone else."

"Expect the FUD coverage of Tesla to accelerate - new tech announced at battery day represents a true existential threat to high-volume ICE manufacturers. Until now, competitors and big oil used the media (who are paid to advertise for them) to create FUD about Tesla to years. Now with Tesla scaling their proprietary battery technology you should expect utility companies begin to recognize Tesla as an existential threat through its sustainable energy capture, storage, intelligent distribution software, and microgrid solutions. Tesla is a disruptor of some of the largest sectors - commercial and consumer transport & energy. Don't fall asleep on this opportunity. You may never see another like it."

"There better not be anything artificial about the perception of Elon's intelligence (or common sense) tonight. Imo, today's hype rally is a mistake, as there is nothing for Tesla to gain from it, but much to lose. If there is a ""Wait..., What?"" moment, confidence in Tesla/Musk (same entity) will waver.

"Why did Tesla drop prices on S/X/3 models worldwide on February 28th 2018, in some cases up to 46%?Why if you look up Tesla S/X inventory can you get an average discount from already dropped prices of an additional 10% to 20%?Since they claim plenary of demand, then vehicle sales should be >125k with these specials this quarter.Looking forward to April 1st for vehicle sales and if Tesla still around then looking forward to Q1 2019 earnings release."

You gotta admit - Mr. Musk sure knows how to run a business.
"If you bought a TESLA when the stock IPO’d you would have paid just over $55k and that care would be worth less than 10k today!

Rivian is looking for an $80 billion IPO valuation. Tesla IPOed with a $1.7 billion valuation which was seen as crazy by most at the time. Rivian has been in business for 12 years and has yet to deliver 1 vehicle. Tesla had sold vehicles pre-IPO.I'm not arguing with Rivian's valuation. I just want to know if all the Tesla haters could soon focus their attention over there instead.

"serious question, why do Tesla shareholders get so mad if someone says TSLA is overvalued. The top 5 most profitable car companys made around 31.5 billion in profit and over 18mm cars yet TSLA loses money on cars and made under 800mm off Carbon Credits and bitcoin yet its more valuable then all the Car manufacturers combined. TSLA is a good company and isn't going anywhere, its just insanely overvalued - being propped up by the Musk diehards and the influx of money to Tech ETFs."
$771. Nice! Tesla long & strong. Hopefully it'll go back up above the $850 level by the end of the year.
factory is literally closed for 2 months and the stock is almost 100% up. Reality might be might be finally setting in.
The hard truth Wood doesn't admit is that competition is coming fast in the EV segment. Tesla will always stay a niche company.

Furthermore, as the pharmaceutical industry seeks innovative and more effective techniques for unit dose distribution, the demand for convenient drug delivery systems is giving rise to the growth of the prefilled syringes market. Prefilled vials improve patient safety by lowering the risk of accidental needle sticking and harmful product exposure that can occur while drawing medication from vials. Prefilled syringes can also help eliminate dosing errors and improve patient compliance by pre-measuring dosage. Unlike vials, which are overfilled by as much as 20-30% to allow for potential waste, prefilled syringes can completely eliminate the need for manufacturers to overfill.COVID 19 Analysis:The COVID 19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on the market for prefilled syringes. It had a short-term impact on the supply chain and the drug production process, which influenced the market. HCPs have evolved various approaches to give the care to minimize the spread of COVID 19 and comply with regulations. To lessen the risk of needle-stick injuries, demand for prefilled syringes grew far faster than that for glass ampoules. To satisfy the demand for COVID 19 vaccination, producers are boosting their production capacity. Recently, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to offer Laboratoire Aguettant a license to market Dzuveo in Europe in exchange for two prefilled syringe product candidates in the United States. Aguettant will have the right to market Dzuveo in Europe under the terms of the Dzuveo licensing deal. AcelRx will receive up to $55 million in up-front and sales-based milestone payments, as well as revenue sharing payments ranging from 35% to 45% of net sales."

"""going forward 20% margin on 6 billion in revenue will cover our nut.""Where does the cult get the notion that tesla will 1. generate $6 billion in revs and 2. be profitable in q3?Let's look at q2 A. Margins -The margins last qtr were 13% on cars they sell for $100,000 and you clowns think selling cars for $50,000 will cause margins to expand?B. Revenues -""Tesla’s Q2 2018 production totaled 53,339 vehicles,...Model 3 production, which reached a total of 28,578 units, also exceeded the combined Model S and X production of 24,761 vehicles during Q2 2018.................Q2 deliveries totaled 40,740 vehicles, of which 18,440 were Model 3, 10,930 were Model S, and 11,370 were Model X..""Let's forget there's a huge demand problem for the Edsel 3. Not one cult member on this board owns one.So revs will be about 50,000 x 19,000 + $90,000 x 22,000 = ~ $3 billion autos Energy & Storage & services another $700,000,000Total revenues q2 '18 =~ $3.7 billion$3.7 billion x 0.13 = $480 million.

"Let's review the bidding shall we?......................Tesla’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month continues.This one-time Wall Street darling has seen its stock price plunge 38% so far this year, and 22% in just the past month. The car maker also just slashed the U.S. base prices of its two most expensive models, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV.Suddenly, Tesla bulls (well some with some sense of sanity) are turning bearish.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives slashed his price target to $230 from $275, saying Tesla faces a “Kilimanjaro-like uphill climb” to hit targets for profitability in the second half of the year.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones had an even more dire prediction. His worst-case scenario for the stock is $10, saying “demand is at the heart of [the automaker’s] problem.Just this month Tesla was able to raise $2.4 billion by selling shares and convertible debt, but it wasn’t enough to reassure investors, especially after CEO Elon Musk said the carmaker would burn through the money in about 10 months.Self-professed Tesla bear, Erin Gibbs, who is equity chief investment strategist at S&P Global, says things could get even worse for Tesla.“I think some of the issues around the convertible debt could take the stock to plummet territory,” Gibbs says. “It’s one of those stocks I do not recommend anybody get in.”And if that's not bad enough,..................Gibbs adds, “A lot of guys have guy crushes on Elon Musk.

"People never learn. I never understood the philosophy of willing to pay now for what a company might be worth in 5-10 years. You will get burned 99% of the time. Tsla's numbers never added up to the valuation, but all you heard from longs was ""we are looking at long term"". It reminds me of when I used to sell baseball cards for a living. People would be willing to pay up big for a some player's rare card before he even played in the majors, $500, even $1000. Player never panned out and now the cards are basically firewood. Same thing with Tsla. I just don't understand paying 10 times or a lot more in this case of what it is worth for something that might be."

Recently, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to offer Laboratoire Aguettant a license to market Dzuveo in Europe in exchange for two prefilled syringe product candidates in the United States. Aguettant will have the right to market Dzuveo in Europe under the terms of the Dzuveo licensing deal. AcelRx will receive up to $55 million in up-front and sales-based milestone payments, as well as revenue sharing payments ranging from 35% to 45% of net sales."

"Interesting 1:5 ratio of short spammers. For every 5 actual investors here, there are 25 short spammers working overtime to fearmonger because they are trying their best to artificially drive the price down. Shorts have lost billions in the past 12 months alone. Their biggest immediate fear is March delivery numbers; $TSLA, $NIO, $XPEV are all going to be very good for China because you had consumers not take delivery in Feb due to their new year and shorter business day month in general, so those will boost March numbers. Keep buying. Keep holding."

"The price of a stock or any product is how much buyers or market think it's worth. There's really no wrong or right price IMO. At this time, $TSLA is worth $800+ dollars because buyers have determined that Tesla is a very valuable company to the world's future. So let it be written and let be said."

Crazy thing was I had a iron condor set up with 20 options at a $690 price for a 6$ premium.. seconds before close they were worth .12c!!!! the stock sky rocked to 695.

Don't car companies produce new models every year? TSLA has three (2 1/2?) models after about ten years. What model year is the Model 3? What about next year's Model 3? TSLA's competitors are managing continual model change while TSLA is struggling to produce one new model.

"Tesla is headed to the mid to high $500's. WHY !!? Because we counted out GM, F, VW, Toyota and Honda a bit quick i think!. Keep in mind that Legacy car companies did not start to compete with Tesla until this year 2021, before they were still hoping Tesla might fail but have all but given up on that and now and are 100% behind EVs tech. So the competition has really only started this year. When values were calculated for Tesla 2022-30 we all just assumed they would just double their sales for ever! .. or at least until 2030, but that actually seems ""impossible"" now that the sleeping giants of the car industry have awakened. PS. GM, F, VW, and others are outselling Teslas in China, Germany, Norway and the EU. with this in mind we need to be more modest about 2022 - 30 sales and this re calculation will have a pull back in Teslas ""perceived value"" I personally think the Top was. $800-$850 and we will slowly travel back to the high $500 over 2021 as sales figures come in for the EV/ice companies. Assuming that someone who has bought 4 GMs (or F,VW etc...) in a row is going to buy a Tesla are just plain wrong. Legacy car companies currently have 98% of the car market, assuming that somehow that will be gifted to Tesla is also wrong"

"Here is real world data. Bought my MX 4 years ago. 60,000 miles. Range has lost about 4%. I supercharge most of the time. (Free supercharging) range is around 283-285. I still have enough range for those weekend excursions. I charge up to 250 miles and run it down to 60 miles. I’m expecting to continue up hampered for my 190 mile weekends until I reach my 250k miles on the pack. This Tesla will be at around 15 years old by this point and I’ll buy a new pack at that point. I disclose i rarely charge above 70% at a supercharger unless off on a road trip and then never above 90%. I average 330 wh/mi in the summer and 430 wh/mi in the winter. I run studded snows in the winter. Another thing I have done is to try and not to discharge below 30% state of charge. I’ve babied my pack, other than supercharging it."

The automaker more than halved the division that delivers its electric vehicles to North American customers, two of the laid-off workers said.Some 150 employees out of a team of about 230 were let go in January at the Las Vegas facility that gets tens of thousands of Model 3s into the hands of U.S. and Canadian buyers, they said, in a sign the company expected the pace of deliveries to significantly slow in the near term.The cuts, which have not been previously reported, could fuel investor worries that demand for the Model 3 in the United States has tailed off after a large tax break for consumers expired last year and the car remains too expensive for most consumers.Tesla has said its focus this quarter is on supplying cars to customers waiting in China and Europe.""There are not enough deliveries,"" one of the former employees told Reuters.

Works in warm climates but Tesla never tested this car elswhere.In cold weather below 10 F, the battery controls act to prevent damage and even a supercharger will take hours to charge enough to equal a gallon of gas.

"Well, I sold my #TSLA position today. I love the vision of the company, but the stock is priced too rich now.

2017 - Tesla introduced the Roadster 2.0 2021 - 4 years later - it's not in production The newest delay was announced ahead of schedule.

"A GUY with good investment vision: He began buying Tesla at just $7.50, and now he’s retiring at 39 years old with $12 million worth — he still refuses to sell a single share“No, I don’t think so. The energy and transportation sectors are being disrupted, and Tesla’s stock price reflects that,” DeBolt explained. “I think we could eventually see $20,000 to $30,000 per share by 2030 if they can execute, assuming no more stock splits.”He said he currently owns 14,850 Tesla shares at an average cost basis of $58 each. His first purchase was 2,500 shares at $7.50 in 2013. That batch is now worth about $2.2 million, he said.“This company is just getting started,” DeBolt told Ramp. “We might not see a company like Tesla in the next 50 years.”"

"Toyota sells 20x more cars than tesla will in 2020, but is worth 1/2 as much. TSLA will have to succeed in a scalable software or FSD service to justify this valuation.

That's why I find it hard to hold this stock. I'm waiting for a market drop to buy at a more fair bottom line price."

"Observations about @elonmusk's $420 LBO announcement:First, the context is odd: Musk promised on the conference call that $TSLA will be forever profitable. So why does he need to go private to ""end negative propaganda from shorts""? And why let them off the hook at $420?Musk suggests there will be no controlling shareholder in the LBO. He also says financing is already arranged. Ergo, he implies a syndicate of lenders has already signed documents for the deal. This is odd for two reasons...First, Musk recently rebuffed an investment offer from Saudi Arabia. If you're passing the hat for the largest LBO syndicate in history, why say no to a big check?Second, a $70B syndicate would involve numerous banks, dozens of lawyers, and multiple boards of directors. It's been [over] 12 hours since the announcement, and none of these parties has confirmed Musk's claims.Which raises a general point: a $70B dollar deal is a Jupiter-sized briar patch of legal and regulatory rules. It's a minutely choreographed thing, with legal risk for any party that says or does the wrong thing at the wrong time. With that in mind:Why did $TSLA not request a trading halt until an hour after Musk's tweet? Why did the company belatedly post an email from Musk, rather than an official statement? Why did Tesla not file an 8-K disclosing details of the purported LBO?Musk says he will not sell in the deal. What about his ~$800M in margin loans? Will lenders accept illiquid collateral? What about change of control provisions on $TSLA's debt? Who will fund the mandatory tender? Why did Musk's initial tweets portray this as a done deal, if his subsequent email revealed it to be merely his intention?Were these plans in the works when Musk publicly predicted a ""short burn of the century"" and a short squeeze larger than Volkswagen? Were they in the works when he aggressively purchased $TSLA shares in the premarket?If this deal is real, it won't be wrapped up for at least 6 months, and probably longer: a) need to assemble an independent board to vote on the deal (a court ruling this year decided that $TSLA's board is not independent of Musk), b) need a proxy statement with extensive risk disclosures (some think this is why $TSLA couldn't take the Saudi PIPE in the first place), c) need a shareholder vote, d) need antitrust review, even if perfunctory.Meanwhile, cash burn continues - in order to avoid default on their ABL, they must have cash/avail on Jan 1, 2019 sufficient to cover both 2019 convert maturities as well as a $400M buffer. That comes to $1.8B. At June they had $2.2B of cash and are burning close to $1B per quarter. Tough math.Musk says shareholders won't be forced to sell. How does that work? A private company with thousands of shareholders is still required to make SEC filings. How will unaccredited investors retain shares?The fact that none of these details was alluded to by Musk is further evidence that Musk has not discussed the deal with lawyers. Which brings us back to the question: how do you line up $70B in financing without involving a legal team?"

"I am thinking that after the second whitsleblower coming out last week, we will start seeing more insiders blowing the whistle.I would like to see some info coming out about dwindling M3 demand and/or suppliers requiring COD. Something big is brewing on this front... Why the slowing production and buildup of finished goods in the parking lots? A couple of analysts have theorized that the thousands of cars rotting in lathrop and burbank and santa barbara are pre-built RWD versions (the cheaper variety of M3) If that's the case, that would show that lower Tesla price does not make demand rise.There is probably very little demand for m3 at all, hence very little probabiliy that Tesla will survive to see 2019 without a Chap 11 reorg"

"Hey Apes....https://www.reddit.com/r/AMCSTOCKS/comments/pgu6my/latest_update_by_ee_be_prepared_my_fellow_apes/Also, On Sept. 2nd, the NSCC published the NSCC-2010-010 rule delayed until Nov 10th. NSCC-010 is designed to soften the market crash due to meme stocks AMC & GME primarily. The DTCC does not want the SHFs to liquidate ALL their long hold positions stocks (Citadel long hold 6,200 stocks) ""all at once"" to crash the market in order to cover their short positions. This should tell you how massive these 2 meme stocks are & the numbers of the synthetic shares created by these SHFs.... I believe AMC MOASS is coming either by 1). the NSCC rules, especially rule 2021-005 and FOMO buying & Gamma Squeeze or 2). Via the market crash, as mentioned. Nothing has changed except this provides SHFs more time to create additional synthetic shares & more time for retail investors to accumulate more AMC shares before the market crash (if not via item #1). it takes time to implement new rules, especially ""big impact"" rules such as NSCC-010. SHFs have borrowed tens of millions more shares & dark pools trading is still shown 64% for the past few weeks. The longer the delay, the more synthetic shares are created, the deeper these SHFs under water, the higher AMC ""PEAK"" price when MOASS happens, as mentioned. The MOASS is inevitable. They can't stop it. They can only continue to kick the can down the road ""playing with fire"", until it blows. Apes are not leaving. These are only my research and opinions. Do your own research before investing. $AMC, $HOOD, $TSLA"
"There are two very different schools of thought clashing over the $TSLA valuation. On one hand, the old school - Buffett, Bury, etc. with their eyes always on present-day fundamentals, on the other hand Cathie Wood who's all about scouting for 'exponential growth' potential.These are all very smart people, but what if old-school financial conservatism is tantamount to short-sightedness in the high-tech age? After all, Buffet did miss the Big Tech boat in the early 2000s. The outcome of the argument might have a big influence on how we value stocks in the future. If Wood's valuation model is proven right, it may have massive ramifications in the markets.One of Wood's main points is that, in industries exposed to disruption by AI, holders of the most relevant data (used to train AI models) will have a decisive competitive advantage. This is her main reason for judging that other EVs will not be able to compete on fully-autonomous for years, by which time Tesla would capture the market.How do you marry this with traditional benchmarks and how do you even figure out the quantity and quality of data held by companies? While it's supposed to weigh so heavily on growth prospects, and implicitly onvaluations, most companies are very secretive about it!How do you price in the secret sauce when you don't know if it's any good or how much of it there is?"
"How long can Ark keep injecting $140m daily in this stock and what will happen to the price when they can no longer do it?It's still down over 20% from the highs despite over $1bn Ark intervention. How many more days can she keep doing that for? She's already down 10% on last week's $TSLA purchases. It's becoming like the whole stockmarket now, i.e. if Fed stops printing and injecting $trillions it tanks. Except Cathie isn't the Fed."

"TSLA has been such a huge winner! Looking for the next big winner lead me to a little company in Austin that could actually help TSLA become more of a winner.TSLA acquiring Ideal Power's (IPWR's) revolutionary, next generation power switch for its electric vehicles would put TSLA even further ahead in the driving range race! IPWR's patented design is a true bi-directional power device vs. the 4 components currently used (2 IGBT's and 2 blocking diodes). The efficiency of this one device vs. four components increases switching speed, saves space, reduces thermal management requirements, and reduces conduction losses up to 5X!The end result is substantial driving range improvement of electric vehicles with no additional advancements in battery tech necessary.My last 10 bagger in this semiconductor space was MPWR (look at that chart), if you're a long term investor looking for monster outsized gains, IPWR is the next one!"

Where is the appetite for shorting this stock anymore? Why are bears seemingly giving up on this stock at these supposedly overvalued prices?
Guys like Michael Burry thrive on investor fear. Once the fear drives momentum they become material. If you're afraid of your investment here you haven't done your homework. It's a growth company and growth companies are always a target. You have to live with these events the same as you enjoy the green candles up. The up move will restart. Increased earnings will continue. The stock price will follow.
Wow! I’m so long Tesla!
"TSLA should license out the DOJO AI chain (chip, tile, ExaPOD) benefiting co's and org's such as MIT, Boston Dyanmics etc. SRGA (pure spine play) recently was granted a patent for an AI machine learning system for automated segmentation of a three-dimensional bony structure in a medical image expanding and further strengthening the company’s HOLO AI tech portfolio. Perhaps could be an adjunct to NeuraLink?"

"Tesla ended 2020 with 0.78% global passenger vehicle sales share and 15.42% global EV sales share, despite ""record sales"" (and a barely detectable profit, mainly by selling regulatory credits).99.2% of car buyers didn't buy a Tesla and 84.6% of EV buyers didn't either."
Q3 will be a great quarter for Tesla based on great demand for EV (5 months wait to get a model 3 or Y). Good chance we will get back to $800 price by the end of this quarter. Cheers
"TSLA is so strong. Get ready to gap up and fly to the moon 800+zone, TSLA!"
"how much of a decline will we see in Q1 sales numbers? Demand for the model S and X are in decline after 2 years of flats sales. Pent up demand in the USA has eliminated any waiting lists and all indications are there are plenty of unsold inventory for customers to choose from. I expect Model S and X sales will be near 20,000 for Q1 and 45,000 model 3 as pent up European and Chinese demand is met with shipped cars. As Tesla states expect around 10,000 cars in transit . The focus will then be Chinese factories and new models. And then back to the markets to raise capital. The next year story will once again turn into a next year story. 2019 sales 82,000 combined S and X , 184,000 model 3 world wide."
"Tesla boarding time to flight 780+station, TSLA."
"((( Tesla China's local sales fell about 16% in Q2 vs. Q1, ))) ((( In July, Tesla unveiled a cheaper, lower-range made-in-China Model Y ))) According to the article they only sold 13,000 units in China. That is roughly 4% of the EV segment.Or about 1% of the overall auto market."
"Buy Tesla shares get ""friends and family"" stock pricing when Starlink goes public next month."
"Elon Musk's success in putting the USA back in self-reliance to transport our astronauts back to the space station will elude to advancing the space program to revisit the moon. This accomplishment could and should lead to Tesla reaping the rewards, although the Space X program is from a different program. Today's launch may bring about Tesla surpassing its all-time high and propel the shares to 1k in the near term. The success of the rocket once again landing on a platform at sea confirms that the accuracy of the Tesla vehicles will have the best accuracy of maneuvering when the program is set to auto-pilot or self-driving mode. Monday premarket and close will allow plenty of opportunities to buy Tesla at current levels before what appears to confirm shares that will become very expensive well into the future. As far as Boeing as a second option no pressure, but they have not been performing as thought and any failure from their proposal can add another massive increase to Tesla from where any of the highest target that has been called for the shares."
I’m long Tesla but I personally don’t care what the price is doing right now. I’m more excited to see them continue to innovate at an exponential rate. In 20 year when I’m ready to retire I’ll have to figure out how to spend all my money.
"Last week, I took a 2,400 mile backroads road trip through NV, UT, AZ and CO. Saw hundreds of Teslas, perhaps up to 1K. Most of these roads were not primary highways, and temps were in the mid 80-90's. Obviously, the Tesla owners are expanding their confront zones, regarding range, even while using air-conditioning. The Super Charging network, combined with 3rd party systems, makes this possible. What I didn't see (and I was looking) was even one Tesla towing a trailer, while I'd estimate 1 of 5 non-EVs tagging behind. 100% day-trippers."
"For the lucid fans hanging around this board, it’s 2021 goal is to make 577 vehicles. Just think for a minute, that is less than half of the vehicles Tesla makes in one day in Shanghai or Fremont. It’s in a different league."
"I still find it amusing that the bears here continue to suffer on not being able to ever recover the losses from last year. Stock now on the way to $1,000, and they are still here and attempting to move the fake news to spark some sort of scare that would make the masses to sell off their TSLA stock. When all was needed to recup all those looses would be to admit being wrong about the only true 100% American car maker that has provided thousand of jobs to Americans and not bargain for the mass loss of auto works who lost their jobs in the US in the same interval of TSLA expansion. This is regardless of your affection on being green but standing for the best of capitalism has to offer, to become who you want if you work hard, have a vision and give back to your country."
" EV demand is massive and Tesla couldn't even sell 250,000 vehicles in the quarter. The competition is going to eat Teslas breakfast lunch and dinner."
"To summarize. The Houston crash into a tree that was supposed to be a Tesla on autopilot wasn’t because autopilot was not engaged (fact). The driver was legally drunk (fact). Where’s CNBC, wsj, Bloomberg et al trumpeting the actual truth?"
"Thanks to Global Warming, a Florida property owner is seeing his annual premium soaring from $ 441 to $ 4 986.See Wall Street Journal ""Homeowners face huge premium increases"" .To make up for the exploding cost,may I suggest him to buy a Tesla !Fossil fuels are more and more threatening and costly for Florida, lets turn off the pump,this is the only way out of this climate mess..."
SoooooTomorrow there are 28000 options at the strike price of $690. Then there is 70000 Option at the strike price of $700.NO WONDER Those Market makers are trying to Keep TSLA below $700.This explains it all.
"Longs, this is your last chance to buy at $640! Buy all you can! If you wait, you'll need to pay $600."
"When is Musk going to tweet the new date for the cross country fully autonomous trip including recharging since it is officially now very close to Feb, 2018 and ""in 2017 or very close"" has passed. He also needs to tweet something on how that fully autonomous charging is going to work without and human intervention. I am 99.999% positive won't happen and he should admit it(unless he has fully autonomous battery swaps in place with no humans to operate them)"
"I predict that 2021 will see the all time forever high in TSLA.With good execution, TSLA may achieve as much as $20/share in earnings by 2025.But, that will be about its high. The auto industry is cyclical. One year TSLA will post a loss and the stock will have cratered."
Cathy is selling TSLA everyday in her ETFs.
Slow sales also are indicated by the overflowing staging lots.Of particular interest is the Burbank lot. The Burbank lot was needed to temporarily store June cars for delivery in July. It should have been depleted by now. The cars should have already been delivered to Service Centers. New cars should also be going directly to Service Centers. There is no advantage for holding the Burbank inventory - unless the cars are not deliverable for some reason.
"Weird. When I search for ""Top AI Leaders"" or ""Which Companies are leading in AI"" I get dozens of ""top lists"" and related articles. Top researchers. Top AI applications. Cloud AI leaders. Etc. Etc. But, NOT A SINGLE mention of Tesla. It is almost as if Tesla is NOT an AI leader. Weird."
$800 then $900
"Elon Must tweeted ""many exciting things will be unveiled on battery day sept 22"""
Tesla's new Dojo D1 chip is revolutionary and this is just the start of Tesla's AI Training ... a totally elegant piece of engineering
"Join the NIO opportunity... TSLA shipped 90K cars per Q1NIO shipped over 10K cars per Q1So if NIO is 10% of TSLA, thats $150 But TSLA has 185M shares outstandingNIO has 903M shares outstandingso $150/5 = $30 per shareIt will go sky highNIO is now trading $15 per share instead of $30 per share hence undervalued"
