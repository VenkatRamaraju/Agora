"stop trying to trade this thing....either own it or don't. in the meantime, this thing has quietly started to grow into its fundamentals all while the shorts have been screaming for years about it being overvalued. now nearing a 13x sales run-rate (assuming $50b in sales)....just wait until you wake up some day and it's trading at 3-6x sales and EPS comes way down.....due your own DD and never take advice from a message board.good luck to all...rainking"
"So Tesla spends precious resources developing a car that no one needs, very few want, and harms the environment. Why? Because they can not earn a profit on base Models 3 and Y, let alone any affordable Tesla (Model 2). Tesla is currently only building 3 cars: S Plaid, and Performance 3 and Y; all highest priced versions."
Happy birthday to the greatest human of our time!

"Stop saying tomorrow this, tomorrow that. Think in terms of quarters and years. It’s totally amateur to think short term in this stock. Don’t pay attention and just hold. You will do very well."
I guess a self-burning tartan Tesla trumps higher model 3 sales. Or is it falling Bitcoin value causing today's drop in share price?
Stellantis Group === will stop buying eco-credits in from TeslaThe $480 million quarterly hit puts Tesla into the red. It also accelerates the decline in auto revenues.
It's a buy at $590.... I'll wait.
Does anyone have good guess TSLA last Quarter total delivery? I see a lot of TSLA in the roads!

"Tesla quality?Took delivery of a 2021 Model Y last December. Had a 17 item check list in hand (from the Internet) of flaws to look for. My Tesla has ALL 17 and more. There were so many defect I actually lost count. Close inspection showed that every single part on the car was made improperly. Not 90% or 95% but 100% of the parts were defective. The car was perfectly flawed - everything was 100% wrong. It now has 7,000 miles on it with over 7,000 service visits That's one breakdown per mile on average. In over a half century of driving many different makes and models this is the worst car I've ever owned. I also have several Tesla cars sitting unused because I can't afford to repair them. BNo one will buy them. I have even offered to pay people to take them away - but no one answers my ads. Anyone who believes people who disagrees with me has never owned a Tesla. Every single Tesla owners is completely 100% dissatisfied with their cars. It's amazing really. 100% dissasatification is rare - but Tesla has done it. PS: I am just mocking Tesla longs here."

"It seems NIO is not the only car company hit by the supply chain shock.Some operations at Tesla's Shanghai plant were temporarily shut down in August, with part of one production line halted for four days because of a shortage of key chips, Bloomberg said Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.One particular shortage was related to the availability of electronic control units, which largely caused delays in the output of Tesla's Model Y, one of the people said, adding that production has now returned to normal."

GOING ALL IN PLAID SUIT TODAY!!!
While in Oregon this past weekend for the olympic trials my wife and I saw over 140 trucks with model 3s and Ys on them. Amazing. We only saw about 3 or 4 other car haulers the whole time.
FUD news spreading on the recall.. DONT GET FOOLED!. the 285k cars can be update virtually NOT hardware issues.. its merely a software patch. FUD FUD
Tesla will do just fine in the future.It is a high growth company which will outperform the S&P 500 over the long term.Ignore the short term volatility. Musk is a genius. Do not bet against him.
TSLA started wobbling from the day it invested in Bitcoin and will continue to be unstable till it does only EV and battery business. It will go down further
"So after a year and a half (model y) the biggest automaker (by value) was able to put on market a motor option (plaid) for its 10 year hold model S ... really impressive , a this rate Tesla will dominate the car market in not less than century"
I feel tsla is coming big move (either 15% up or down).

I keep getting mixed information on this one but can someone tell me when Tesla is releasing their delivery numbers? Is it this week?
Why did it go up today? What did i miss?
Long term investor and very excited to see Starlink go public
Well today marks the last day of Q2 deliveries we shall know the numbers very soon
"Tesla’s competition is still missing important points. Supercharger stations are popping up all over. Faster than the early gas stations. Any other brand BEV will offer less charging options. They are still not advancing autonomy fast enough. Tesla is still on target for 50% production and sales growth each year. Gigafactorie’s Shanghai ramp up, Austin and Berlin starting and Fremont lowering cost and increasing manufacturing efficiency. All lead to meeting those growth expectations. Demand (large back orders on Model Y) continuing unabated. The new flagship cybertruck first production this year. TSLA is still on track, strong and a long term winner."
"There better not be anything artificial about the perception of Elon's intelligence (or common sense) tonight. Imo, today's hype rally is a mistake, as there is nothing for Tesla to gain from it, but much to lose. If there is a ""Wait..., What?"" moment, confidence in Tesla/Musk (same entity) will waver. Musk acknowledged that TSLA's inflated share price is precariously dependent on faith (belief without proof)."
"$XPEV $TSLA $LI and the overall market up. Bloated $NIO down again. But the pumpers here never see anything wrong.

They greedily printed way too many shares.Beware of pumpers."
"How many nay sayers are still there to say BK TSLA! TSLA is years ahead of near competitors regardless how you compare....About 1.5 years ago waited 3 weeks to receive Model X100, now I have to wait 7 weeks to get Model 3. How busy demand n Productions."
"From Barron's : Next up is second quarter deliveries, due in about a week. More than 200,000 cars delivered would be a win for shares."
Ok slow and steady.. let’s try to avoid 5%+ days. We don’t want to be associated with meme stocks melt ups and melt downs
Tesla has filed to become a Texas power retailer in a move that could shake up an already fast-changing market
Looks like the Tesla shorties will be eating Ramen noodles for the rest of the summer!
On top of the recall filed with the samr There was a high profile protest at the Shanghai motor show staged by irate customers who are disgusted with the woeful ongoing quality issues and poor fit and finish of the Tesla cars. Tesla would want to get some quality people over from Toyota to sort out their sub standard build issues. Bad day monday
"Saw a Cyber Truck testing past weekend. It was camouflaged in bright yellow paint, and cleverly had a ""AZTEK"" emblem on the lift gate, and a glass bed cover, which I sure hope makes it into production."
"$620 is the ceiling. Even major indexes up so much today, TSLA just stuck at the narrow channel. It sits there waiting a major correction. When a black swan even occurs, TSLA share price will be cut in half. If the worst scenario happens, it will be like those bubble stocks in 1999/2001, lose 90% of the value."
JOKE ON THE LOOSE
Are we running out of would be bag holders? I thought this was going to soar past $700 on its way to at least $750?

The full-size luxury sedan is the first of Mercedes’ new dedicated electric-vehicle architecture and has a range of up to 770 km (478 miles). Compare with Tesla S long range plus - max range 402 miles.Tesla’s market share in the 18 key European markets more than halved from 31% in 2019 to 13.2% in 2020. In 2021 Tesla controls 11.5% of the European market to Daimler’s 7.3% so far.
Tesla doing all kinds of good for this world.
Will Bitcoin still be able to save TSLA this quarter? :)
"Elon Musk has already made his desperate play. Last quarter when he saw he cannot make the earnings estimate, he bought Bitcoins then ask everybody to buy Bitcoins like him. Then after he made that announcement, Bitcoin spiked to almost $55,000. He quickly sold 10% of his holdings. The realized gain makes TSLA earnings exceed the estimate. But he can use this trick only once."
Close green!
China software updates is not a recall. It’s just a softwares updates for certain features of the cars. Software updates are a very normal part of electronics. Wrong word to use.

Beast of a stock. Can’t even hate.
Tsla shorts still think tsla is a car company. They will never learn.
Last week we close at $622.50. We closed this week almost the same. MM are getting better to get money from weekly option buyers.
CON ELON made this QUARTER PROFIT BY PUMPING BITCOIN once again..
"The longer this can’t push past $600, the closer competition is to putting numbers in the board, and the longer people have to realize fully autonomous robo taxis are not happening until well into the 2030s. And Tesla likely won’t be the big winner there. Hype will fade. Valuation will fall in line with typical auto manufacturers. Which is a long long long way down"
All shorts. Remember Elon owns you..
This should go back to $800 soon. Be ready!!
I thinking I’ll buy a Bolt I hear they are …. 60% off ??? I’ll just make sure I park it near a gas station.
"Gosh knows I don't ever have much good to say about TSLA stock - but I do think there is strong support at $600. Doesn't seem to go much below or above. I think when Q2 production and earnings numbers come out that will be a catalyst for a movement either up or down. I think the stock will stay in the $580-$620 range until then. Maybe Musk has some surprise announcement he is planning, like maybe the Cybertruck shipping early, that will goose the stock. So ON THE BRIGHT SIDE I don't see anything that will make this stock fall unless Q2 numbers disappoint, which they probably won't. I think expectations are in the 190K-210K for vehicle deliveries and I think people kind of know based on that what the EPS will be."

"We are approaching the end of the quarter...what a surprise that Enron Musk tweeted about Bitcoin.. just weeks of earnings reports. Bitcoin holdings would have shown a massive loss as it was trading below the average price estimated (34.7k).

This will not end up well."

Very excited to announce I sold my position in TSLA today! Happy to have sneaked out ahead. Waaaay too many electric vehicle options out there now and this stock is priced as if Tesla will dominate. I don’t see it happening. Also Musk has lost my support- so tired of the childish Tweets.
This has been dead in the water since January. You will be seeing pies in the sky only if you are over dosing.
"The month of June still has over a week of selling days left (9 if you count today) and Tesla's quarter end sales are powering ahead. With another 55 cars sold so far today (Saturday sales are unusual in Norway), Tesla has sold 1756 cars this month which is more than double the next best seller. But who is that next best seller?Well, it's Ford. The third is NOT Volkswagen (brand), it's Skoda. Skoda is a VW company of course, but its not VW. They are in 4th place.The next 6 places are all the usual suspects. Volvo, Nissan, Hyundai, BMW, Audi and Mercedes.Tesla can take great comfort that in the most diverse EV market in the western world (Norway), that Tesla has the best selling car, the Tesla Model 3. The downsides is that their marketshare continues to drop. They will likely end up with <10% marketshare on a YTD basis at the end of June in Norway. The number of cars being sold by competitors is ramping nicely and the number of competitors is ramping nicely.There will be 17 individual vehicles with over 1000 units sold by the end of June and 4 of those will have over 3,000 units sold in Norway. That will come from 16 different brands and 11 different companies.This isn't 2018 anymore . . . competition is here.Guru."

"TSLA short interest report as of 6/15 shows the lowest level of short interest since the stock split, less than 40 million. Hardly much basis for a short squeeze."
"((( Last month, Ford Motor F pledged to invest at least $30 billion in EVs by 2025, ))) Wow. At $2 billion per platform that's 15 new unique electric platforms. They would need to sell roughly 7.5 million electric cars per year to justify 15 platforms. Reality - Ford sold 6,614 Mustang Mach-Es In Q1 2021 in the USA. That's about 30,000 a year. Not exactly a runaway success IMO."

Have you seen the size of the Tesla super computer?
Wow vechain is ballooning. Get in tell friends and family we heading for $1
Eventually it will be a level playing field in EVs.. for those who are still hoping for the peak… it’s already gone… Tesla stock has to come in line with other car manufacturers (ev non ev) doesn’t matter as everyone will have at least 4-5 different models of evs.. plus there are new companies like Lucid/rivian joining the competition… so doesn’t matter if Tesla has 4 or 40 gigs factories it will be a very competitive market …

There were just 2 EVs out of about 300 vehicles I passed on the way to work this morning- this typical. One was a Tesla and one was a Ford Mach E.Where are all of the EVs?I'm in one of the those counties that Tesla gets 55% of its sales from- 10% richest counties in the country. The county is actually in the top 1% and two adjoining counties are also in the top 1%.

Tesla hits another 'bump in the road' in China with huge recall.https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/business/tesla-china-recall-intl-hnk/index.html?utm_source=optzlynewmarketribbon
"F and GM and others spend more money for AV and EV will boost AV and EV market prices go up, so that's very good news for TSLA, so TSLA, should strong up, because they spend more money was wasted more money, and they never passed TSLA forever, see AMZN, all retailers spend more money for on line boost AMZN go up,"

Any thoughts what price target this TSLA rally is headed?
TESLA is gone 900 coming once again! I’m well over 119% gains for days!
TESLA IS A BUY. Many analysts are waking up to the growth oppertunity that is Tesla. Just wait till both new factories are operational. It will be game over for other manufacturers. Then Tesla is going to charge them more to use their charging network. Whyll their customers ride around in self driving cars for 199 a month. This company is awesome. And so innovative. And meeting all marks and exceeding them. Delivering record deliveries and margin increase during global chip shortage and pandemic. Buy Tesla is a definite buy
Buy if goes little down !!!

Dumped Tesla today and bought more NIO
Where's that semi truck ? Another Tesla fantasy.
What I don't understand is why these shorts here don't go short lordstown. If you want a short to make money that's the one. Meanwhile Tesla trades sideways and the shorts celebrate when it hits $600 again and again. What happens when it doesn't hit $600? what happens when tesla hits $650 instead?
Power hour before closing buy before it gets to $700 tomorrow!!!

"So what was the ""fix"" to correct the unintended cruise control activation in China? I understand that an OTA should mitigate the risk, but what does it mean for the driver? A second confirmation input, an additional menu? More time looking a menus, instead of out the windshield? The cruise on my Cadillac requires one no-look thumb button depression on wheel. Same for my wipers and wash on stalk, engaged without looking. These menus are dangerous, imo."

"Prediction: All EV makers will see an uptick in consumers trying them, anti Tesla people, and media hype over the actual arrival of competition, BUT in the long run Tesla will show hoghest quality, innovation, and performance. Theyve already proved it, its up to legacy companies to never catch up. Have you seen Sandy Moreno check out the Mustang? Its a joke, and an engineering nightmare. 36 hose connections from a piece that Sandy tried to get rid of WHEN HE WORKED FOR FORD IN 1982."

"Wreckdriver- Tesla only sold 76,000 cars in 2016. However. Tesla sold just under 500,000 cars in 2020. Tesla expects to sell 10 million cars per year in 2030; which would make it the largest auto company in the world. An investment of $10,000 in Tesla stock in 2011 is now worth over $1.5 million.

"As a mechanic, these things have serious problems, especially forthe money. Recently these cars have been catching fire and burn to the ground. It takes 25000 gallons to put out electric vehicles because of the Lithium factor. Think about it like this, when you charge your phone sometimes it can get hot, now apply this to an automobile, with constant heat on the car. Imagine what happens when these things get older. If a new car burns to the ground after a month old it tells you they are being rushed, Even on regular cars, once the electrical problems start things corrode and you can feel the cables getting hot...that's only at 12V's. Put more heat into that and a fire will result alot faster. Electrical fires are uncommon, but the voltage in those Teslas lead to fires if they don't fix it. If they are having these problems a month out i can guarantee you there will be an epidemic of problems to come. Just an observation. I think they are rushing the cars."
Best car company alive!! I can't wait to see everything they do! I love them cause they dare to be different....This company seriously reminds me of Steve Job when he came out with the Iphone and Ipad. I remember when people made fun of Jobs so bad cause of that Ipad...now people love tablets. It's that type of company where they figure out what you want before you want it.
GM says now it will try to spend $35 billion on electric and autonomous cars. GM has more debt than it's worth. bankrupt.

It's related to just the vehicle software, though, and the company will provide a fix via OTA. In a statement posted on Weibo later, Tesla customer support said the company apologized for the inconvenience the recall has caused owners.""Tesla will continue to improve and enhance safety in strict accordance with national requirements and make every effort to bring an excellent and safe driving experience to our customers,"" the statement said.The vehicles included in this recall have safety hazards in extreme situations due to the active cruise control function that may be mistakenly activated by the driver. Tesla has taken the initiative to file a recall plan with the SAMR, the statement said."

"Shortage of used cars? A combination of the pandemic and scarce computer chips cost the global automotive industry $110 billion in 2021 revenue. There were fewer trade- ins for resale. Tesla and other brand BEV owners hold on to one or more of their ICE vehicles for convenience and unique travel requirements. ICE cars and small truck’s repair and parts cost are rising. Stricter federal, state, regional emissions standards and rising fuel prices accelerate attrition. Tesla is subject to more upcoming competition. The ICE vehicle will be around for a while. But once the scale is tipped in favor of the BEV it’s market share rise. There will be plenty of bargains then for used ICE cars."

The part of AI Day that surprised me most was when Elon made the offhanded comment that he would make the full autonomous software available for his competitors to lease so they don't have to spend all the money needed to produce full autonomous vehicles. This is another lucrative revenue stream for Tesla.
Technically speaking TSLA is at trend channel resistance. It could bust through or fall back.

"Solid Power battery vs $TSLA battery1.> Both Silicon based to achieve higher wh/volume and good increase in density.2.> Solid Power battery use solid Electrolyte vs normal by Tesla. Very important difference because both charging time and density will higher for Solid Power.3.> Solid Power Solid Electrolyte very sensitive to moisture so it likely more difficult to manufacture it.4.> Solid power using Cell Stacking vs Tesla use Cylinder design. I think Cell Stacking is better design due to uncontrolled expansion for silicon when charged. Think about expanding paper stake vs roll. When stake and if paper expand sure make bad but it can't hard integrity of stacking but Role, it will harm integrity of roll which not reversible.5.>Solid power taking careful small steps vs Tesla rushing to manufacturing. Infact Tesla trying to build factories with much smaller footprint same time. While market trust Elon Musk, History says trouble coming Tesla way. Delay is already visible.Overall Solid Power battery may not out in mass production until 2024 or so, It's superior technology than Tesla and so should worth at par atleast."
"Per an article I just read on Barron's, Tesla IS required to include its bitcoin losses as part of its Q2 financials, and Barron's estimates those losses to be about $90M. The good news is that the $90M loss will be offset by Model S sales. Or conversely, the bad news is that a big chunk of Model S earnings will be negated by bitcoin loss. Nice gamble, Elon. (Look for Elon to pump Bitcoin between now and June 30 to desperately reduce Q2 loss)"

2.2M shares just bought a few minutes ago. Wow
Why is Tesla up today?
"guess nobody told Teslitas that the market was down today... I live in London and everyone who can, is getting a Tesla that used to have a Porsche or Audi and if you've been here you know that's pretty much the standard!"
Kevin wrote he looked at a parking lot and didn’t see any EVs so that means the worldwide transformation to electric vehicles isn’t happening. Thus illustrating a childlike understanding. pre development of object permanence. The EVs are still in the world even if you don’t see them in your local parking lot Kevin

"low volume, no one selling, no one buying, everyone just holding, made 3k from NIO dip..... loaded up on GS, back to EV, buying nio or zenpen or whatever that chinese company called its like buying fake apple headphones sure they look alike but chinese #$%$ breaks in a month, so will their cars, whats different about tesla is the way cars are designed and engineered and best believe it we are not sharing any software codes, they simply build cars for cheap and we have American engineers on site making sure every part is in spec, cause they sure could care less about quality, you tell them to wear suits and gloves while making PCBs with no supervision they take them off and start smoking cigarettes, its a matter of time until Tesla is the undisputed king of EV, with factories in Russia and Brazil everyone will be driving a tesla just like model T"
Buying some TSLA at this 20 MA level on the one Hour Chart.Good Luck

"About the recall - The fix shows Tesla’s high tech application. “Though it's considered a recall, drivers won't need to take their cars to a service station. The fix has been deployed as a remote software update. It could be argued that the rapid fix via a software update puts the spotlight on the company's software prowess. This could impress not only investors, but also Chinese consumers.”"
This morning’s pre market maybe the beginning of a reality check??

"Tesla ...Bad for environmentOn April 17, when firefighters responded to a 911 call at around 9:30 p.m., they came upon a Tesla Model S that had crashed, killing two people, and was now on fire.They extinguished it, but then a small flare shot out of the bottom of the charred hulk. Firefighters quickly put out those flames. Not long after, the car reignited for a third time.“What the heck? How do we make this stop?’” Buck asked his team. They quickly consulted Tesla’s first responder guide and realized that it would take far more personnel and water than they could have imagined. Eight firefighters ultimately spent seven hours putting out the fire. They also used up 28,000 gallons of water — an amount the department normally uses in a month. That same volume of water serves an average American home for nearly two years."

"Great start to the week, smart money is on Tesla, I think I'll buy more"
According to the news everyone that even draws the idea of an EV is giving Tesla a run for their money.Lol ok We’ll explain why there are zero of these other companies cars in the road
No company could be more overvalued than Tesla. That's obviously what Panasonic thought when they sold their $3.6 billion stake in it.

Look for Musk to pump Bitcoin hot and heavy through June 30. Can't afford to have to declare a big bitcoin loss.
"Comparison of F150 EV vs Cybertruck on cnet . IMO, they can both do well with overlapping customer bases. Don't know how fixed Cybertruck specs are, but maybe they need a 300 mile 4wd version. And the interior had best not be as spartan as the clip except for commercial uses. https://www.cnet.com/videos/see-the-essential-differences-between-the-electric-f-150-lightning-and-tesla-cybertruck/?ftag=CAD1c318f6&bhid=21569679934701892893969160230546&mid=13415266&cid=535275094"
"My guess is that Tesla's Q1 faux-bitcoin-profit will be replaced in Q2 by Model S profit, so earnings will be about the same, but slightly more legitimate and still heavily (50%) reliant on carbon credits. But I don't see anything coming that will cause Tesla to fall, and Q3 looks better with the Model Y and Q4 with the CyberTruck... so, even as a total BEAR, and even though Tesla is massively overvalued, I actually think it will go up over the next 6 months - maybe $750. But I can't bring myself to buy Tesla at this price in the same way I can't buy a $6 Starbucks coffee. Overvalued."

Tesla has cars made in China and California. Soon to be in Germany and Texas! Soon to be in Africa and India.
"Just saw yesterday's announcement of NGAB to merge with Embark Trucks. NGAB is the second SPAC of the Northern Genesis group. They merged the first one into Lion Electric, ticker: LEV. A fantastic outcome based on rigorous analysis and due diligence by the Northern Genesis folks. Seems their second deal will be even better. Embark is a SFO tech company that has pioneered software for autonomous long-haul trucks. Tons of info on their website. My immediate thought is that this would make an incredible ""market-broadening/diversification"" acquisition for Tesla."
"Germany will share our chargers ,1000/ share easy ...cyber truck will be the bonus"
"The recall includes 35,665 imported Model 3 vehicles and 249,855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in Tesla's factory in Shanghai. Customers will not be required to return the vehicles. Instead, they will receive a free software update either remotely or in-person to resolve the issue."

"Recent WSJ headline. “Tesla Model S and Model Y suffer long delivery delays: report” Not noted in the article was,“As of mid-May, Ford was the most shell-shocked brand, with 325,000 vehicles lost, including nearly 110,000 units of the popular F-Series pickup truck, according to the newspaper. GM and Stellantis had to forgo 278,000 and 252,000 vehicles, respectively. Following the F-Series, the most impacted models are the Jeep Cherokee (98,584 units), Chevrolet Equinox (81,833 units), Chevy Malibu (56,929 units) and the Ford Explorer (46,766 units).”This is usual pattern of information selectively that cast unwarranted dispersions on Tesla’s sales activity."

How come the rise in Bitcoin didn’t affect Tesla stock price?
will reach $1000
"Tesla battery fires? “More than 6.5 million vehicles are under recall because they could catch fire at any moment. While that is alarming, what may be more disturbing are the vehicles at risk that are not included in the massive recall.”There are far fewer Tesla car fires. There are over a million Teslas on the road in the world today. “In 2019, there were around 189,500 highway vehicle fires reported in the United States.”Saying Teslas are fire traps is untenable when compared to the number of ICE vehicles that catch fire."
do we think $tsla continues for an even bigger day tmmrw? potentially like one of those good ole +$60 days?

Panasonic and insiders sold in June. 40 billion of market cap has disappeared in the last two days. Stellantis is no longer buying tax credits. Demand for credits has dropped and at best they will receive less. Do you really believe that earnings will be good?
Short Chinese EV companies! Not the best American company like Tesla!
Past 30 days GM is down 10% it’s price driven by wet dreams of Prototypes Nikola and Lordstown but in the end you actually have to build these cars. To date we have the Bolt this after 30 years of GM development. GM better start producing NOW or they will be bankrupt once again. I posted this last week when GM was only down 4% now down 10%. By next week we’ll be down 15% GM is overpriced based on hype
Very undervalued stock! Tesla forced all other car companies to go electric. There tech is at least 5 yrs ahead of competition. All the haters are bringing this down

I placed a buy order at 24 USD per TSLA share. Guess it will take some days until it is filled.
Buying into the fomo here and now for my long hold aka the rest of my life I’m sure there is resistance through $700 and we may see $500 and under again but many people holding this stock are buying again after not having bought the last few years Clarity to massive profitability￼ gets them buying more shares of TESLA I suppose
Since last years covid drop I've told every one here buy/hold shares. 9 months since I've posted I'm back to do the same again. Another uptrend is coming. The build up on this one is going to make history.been courageous is with a good strategies like Ortex_Fx . Very accurate on their trading strategies always handle my investments without worries
"what a week ,TESLA is a big multi national company bla bla bla yes I know but they make all that money but the mobility services will tell on you and your bank account. just what I can't seem to forget was this tech guy from TESLA My wife hired he helped her regained lost data back to her hard drive and at a time last month my bitcoin wallet got hacked we hired this perfect wallet recovery resolve my coin Base account back with my 4Btc to me ,just in case you want to hire [perfect wallet recovery at g mail} the team is good, once you get in touch."
TeSLA IS NOT TECH CHIP AUTONOMY COMPANY>>>AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A MASSIVE TECHNICAL BREAKOUT>>>GOING TO New HIGHS
PICK ME UP !! $760 
Why is tsla tanking?
Why is Tesla callling the OTA update to fix the cars in China an inconvenience when they always promoted those type of things and a major convenience in the past? Make on wonder if they really have a fix or are just going to make it harder to use.
"In retro perspective, Tesla was a Meme stock long before the term became popular. Now it’s just a completely overvalued stock, declining along with Felon’s Meme hybris and pressured by other Meme cars from Ford, VW, GM and really beautiful looking ones like the ones from Mercedes EQ series."
Well sadly I'm not holding any TSLA. But all my ARKs are doing great.
"Did Musk drive the 2019 Tesla Cyber Truck mockup to the steps of the court house this morning? If not, lost PR opportunity, methinks."
American for American if Chinese government doesn’t like Tsla. We will stop buying Nio or li Xpev stock in the USA. So let the movement start here.
It’s not a recall. Owners can do a software update (remotely-online)
"I ordered my model x in March, suppose to be delivered in June, now November, if I’m lucky What a joke Musk, stop tweeting and make cars"
Rates unchanged
looks like 670 is good support. mggts bringing it up an down today. nice consolidation after a 50.00 run
"With Marc Good I have been able to understand Bitcoin investment and how to earn Bitcoins worth $7,000 after every trading session on his platform. telegram @Marcgoodfx"
"Ha - Musk even admitting the CyberTruck might flop. There will certainly be enough sales for 1 or 2 years, but this is ultimately a niche vehicle that will eventually sell 20,000 units/year. If Tesla wants to seriously compete in the 2M/year US pickup market, they need to offer a more traditional body."
Can't wait to see TSLA report huge losses on operations and Bitcoin.
"Chart movements may show institutional buying. Tomorrow if we can push to $650 with higher volume this would show a good chance of it. Also if perception of Q2 numbers are good, there is a possibility of a run up. a run up past $650 could lead to us hitting $700+. A breakdown Below $600 could be bad and we may see a breakdown."
"I understand you TSLA fans don't want to be bothered with P/E or other fundamental indicators of value because (1) TSLA's not a car company it's a tech company (2) TSLA is going to be the largest market cap company, (3) TSLA is not just one company, it's a dozen start ups all with great growth, etc. etc. ...But tell me this: if the prospects for TSLA are so great and the stock a screaming buy at these levels, why are insiders so consistently selling? They, who are in the best position to understand TSLA's prospects, exercise stock options, only to sell the stock immediately. In other companies they tend to hold at least some of the shares.NAVI, just to give an example, (I am not recommending purchase, but I own it so watch it) has had a whole string of executives exercise stock options without any selling."
shorts continue to lose
"As a longtime Tesla Bull, I love Tesla Bears. They are main reason why $TSLA is way up and will continue to take it up.Keep shorting guys "
If the fix to cars in China could be fixed remotely....why didn’t they do it before it became an issue and a recall?
This autopilot probe just creates an inevitable dip for the TSLA clan.
"$700, 1...$700, 2...$700, 3...BINGO!"
"Thought I'd share something I witnessed yesterday in Charlotte while taking delivery of our second Model Y. New Teslas were lined up for their new owners who had delivery appointments. One after another every 30 minutes folks drove off in their new Teslas. In the short time that I was there, I saw a couple of families leave in their Xs, while the rest were in Ys and 3s. One guy I spoke with who said he'd been in the auto industry for the past 30 years was shopping for a couple of Model Ys for himself and his wife. As a shareholder, I have to admit I was smiling the wholetime I was there."
Looks like Tesla is currently a one-trick pony. One variant of one car. Model Y Performance. Good luck ordering anything else.
Oh no I would hate to be short

Ford EVs are still ahead of TESLA
"LG is the Tesla battery supplier, it's coming sheep Bolts are all being recalled due to fires. Advice park Tesla vehicles near a fire hydrant."
"Ford, Rivian and GM are all launching EV commercial vans in the next 12 months. Tesla is working on a grocery getting robot and FSD level 3 beta software. You don’t have to dig, it’s right there in the open yet you still can’t see it (much like autopilot can’t ‘see’ a parked police car with the emergency flashers on)."
"Bitcoin dropped to $29,000. Elon Musk cried to sleep every night. No Q2 earnings beat. No bonus."

"The suspense is killing me. I'm a captive fan (of the technology and promised performance) of the Cyber Truck. I'm dying to see how Tesla was able to achieve the specifications, and price point, promised at the reveal. I'm willing to concede that the CT could be THE superior product (if specs achieved), but only when I see the content and design of the production intent version. Musk has never been one at keeping future products under wraps, but I must say, he sure is keeping this one close to the vest. Since production begins in less than 6 months, I was hoping we'd get a sneak peek, perhaps leaked testing videos, but nada. During Elon's SNL appearance, the show property was re-displayed in New York, and I was like so bummed, hoping for a glimpse of production model. Musk said only change from prototype, was that it would be an inch or two shorter, and I'm hoping that holds true. I'm sure the wait will be worth it, but it sure is excruciating. C'mon Man, throw us a bone...!"
95% of the market (still) have no idea what @elonmusk is talking aboutBecause Tesla is just a car companyAnd competition is coming

"Tesla's Musk now expects to produce vehicles at its gigafactory outside Berlin in October or a bit later, a media report says. Reuters reported that the electric vehicle producer has pushed back the factory's opening date, citing German bureaucracy.

I wonder if the big 3 will be allowed to used Tesla Bots to build cars. Or will the unions block this. ???hmmm unions are fantastic which is why we’ve lost most of our manufacturing to overseas and Mexico even Ford is building the Mach E in Mexico
$TSLA skeptics don’t get how strong Model Y demand is in both US and China. Same dynamic will drive $TSLA EV share in Europe once Berlin opens. This is biggest reason 2022 Street estimates are 40%+ too low (my est $9.60 vs Street $6.50); my 2022 vols are +300K higher than Street.
TSLA up 2.5% - NIO up 6.5% - ha ha ha

"Could TSLA be worth as much as $400 in 2023? When will the reality of the fact that TSLA is a car company and there is just a limited market cap that the market can really support with actual earnings?Obviously, the longs are still quite deluded."
"Enough with the overvalued BS. Amazon had a PE of over 3,600 in 2012 and still runs 60-100 these days. That's what growth stocks do. There were just as many of you kooks dogging AMZN back then. Musk is quirky no doubt but the Revs are tracking exponentially higher not just this year but well into the future and he's already making money. Look past the noise and there's a compelling long term investment."
A total divorce from reality.
$700 by Friday

The TSLA bears are in hibernation at the moment but will be awakened shortly to one hefty margin call. When will these tools ever learn.
Just wait until they get into collaboration with $tsla!!
"This is going to happen … get ready guys,"
The most interesting thing I found about AI Day was when Elon said they would allow other companies to lease their software so they could have Full Autonomous cars as well.
"I will admit, there is some (much) credence that should be given to the long's insistence that P/E is overly weighted, as Tesla is still in it's growth phrase. Increasing revenue by 50% (avg.) annually is a monumental task, and Tesla has been executing. There are numerous other metrics that keep be bearish, but until Tesla reaches it's growth apex, which is quickly approaching, imo, a meaningful P/E cannot be ascertained. Once growth falls at or bellow 10% (still respectable for mature automotive company), the discussions are sure to become interesting."
"TSLA has been such a huge winner! Looking for the next big winner lead me to a little company in Austin that could actually help TSLA become more of a winner.TSLA acquiring Ideal Power's (IPWR's) revolutionary, next generation power switch for its electric vehicles would put TSLA even further ahead in the driving range race! IPWR's patented design is a true bi-directional power device vs. the 4 components currently used (2 IGBT's and 2 blocking diodes). The efficiency of this one device vs. four components increases switching speed, saves space, reduces thermal management requirements, and reduces conduction losses up to 5X!The end result is substantial driving range improvement of electric vehicles with no additional advancements in battery tech necessary.My last 10 bagger in this semiconductor space was MPWR (look at that chart), if you're a long term investor looking for monster outsized gains, IPWR is the next one!"

"Elon Musk’s bad bet: Bitcoin’s sudden dive will hit Tesla with a Q2 lossJust before 9 AM on June 22, Bitcoin's price sank to $29,511, its lowest level since the early hours of January 2, and 55% off its all-time record of $64,863 achieved just ten weeks ago. This is bad news for all crypto investors, but especially so for BTC's chief influencer, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The reason: Musk likely bought every Bitcoin on Tesla's books at a higher price. The upshot is that in Q2, Tesla will be taking a substantial write-down on the celebrated wager that helped launch the bull run that's turned into a freefall.By just after noon, Bitcoin had surged back to around $32,000. As we'll see, that relief rally won't save Tesla from booking a hefty charge."
"$WKHS Alright guys I don't post much but I believe I should share some of my knowledge. I truly believe WKHS is one of the best stocks to be in at the moment and here is why:1) Currently it is the most shorted stock holding over 51% SI of FF as reported by Ortex.2) It also has a lot of hype built around it with it currently being #5 most talked about on WSB discussion data as reported by Quiverqant.3) On top of that, the market cap is very low compared to other companies such as AMC, do not get me wrong I am not trying to downplay other companies but I am just trying to compare it to the legendary meme stock. AMC's market cap is currently 21.48B and WKHS is at only 1.86B. When AMC was at 11.45 it only had a market cap of 5.37B. Also AMC had less short interest more than half of what WKHS has when it popped off from this level. Say WKHS gets similar love that AMC had, it could legit shoot like crazy. If WKHS is at a 20B market cap, which is very likely due to more than double the amount of short interest, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of around $164 per share. Even if it only gets a market cap of 5B, this will put WKHS shares at a valuation of $41 per share.Overall, I see crazy potential with this stock and I truly believe that this is one of the hottest stocks in the market as of right now!"
Wallstreet may run up the markets taking TSLA up after 3 days drop. Good Luck

How’s mr.burrys shorts doing? 
We were 700 about 9:30 trading hours ago...
how much revenue do you think Tesla pulled in from carbon credits? for the past few quarters this amount has determined their earnings so i wonder what it’ll be this time???
I am on good authority this will hit 1000 by end of summer. (im kinda a big deal).
Back over $700 tomorrow!
Imo. Part of the reason Musk is promoting Bitcoin is because buying crypto vacuums dollars out of the system which lowers inflation because inflation will gut companies like Tesla.
Happy to see it get passed above 666 and a strong weekly close above 666 will put us into a great next week ! PT to 2000 likely in 3 months followed by either stock split 2:1 or more offering!

"A lot of misinformed on this board. Tesla was ordered to fix a problem with their cars in China. That is a recall even if that problem can be resolved by an OTA update because it is not a regularly scheduled update, but one Tesla is being forced to make."
Drive from central California up to the Bay Area frequently. See car carrier after car carrier of new Teslas heading south on I-5. The Supercharging stations along the way are often very busy. This scenario is occurring in many regions of the country. Texas is next.

"Have to give some credit to the legacies both foreign and domestic. They’re spending billions trying to bring out a line of competitive BEVs. But they still aren’t matching what Tesla has, is and will accomplish. They fall short on autonomy, battery/motor/power efficiency, innovative manufacturing technology, pricing, range, performance, interior design, safety, style, driver experience, the “wow” factor, simplicity of service, brad recognition and charging opportunities. Some have some of these attributes but non have all of them compared to a Tesla."

"((( Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Johns Hopkins University in the spring of 2011. She brought with her a machine she said could test tiny samples of blood for dozens of conditions and thick binders of data to show its accuracy. A Hopkins scientist told her that his researchers needed to put the device in their Baltimore laboratory to verify the technology on Walgreens’ behalf, and Ms. Holmes agreed to provide one, say people familiar with the meeting. It never happened. ))) ((( CEO Elon Musk explained how the team is set to follow a three-step process to get its vehicles offering rides to people. The company plans to enable every Tesla vehicle built since October 2016, all of which have been fitted with a suite of cameras and sensors, to upgrade its software and computer to support point-to-point autonomous driving with no human taking over. This, in turn, will enable the car to offer rides to members of the public autonomously – all without requiring a human driver. )))It never happened."

"At this stage, the major competitor of NIO's flagship SUV ES8 is $TSLA's Model X. However, there are several reasons to believe that the ES8 is a more attractive car in comparison to the Model X, and as a result, NIO has all the opportunities to outsell its competitor in China in the long run. First of all, the ES8 has more legroom and headroom than the Model X, it also has a luxurious interior, and it comes with three different battery packages that could last from 415 kilometers to 580 kilometers on a single charge.All of the ES8 SUVs include a proprietary operating system, have advanced navigation software, and most importantly cost ~$70,000 per vehicle in China, which is below the cost of Tesla's Model X, which comes at a price tag of ~$110,000 per vehicle in the region. I believe that this pricing advantage will undoubtedly help NIO to outsell Tesla in the SUV segment, especially since its cars now could be purchased at a discount thanks to the new Chinese subsidy program."

"Why is Musk, the CEO of a company with a large stake in BTC-USD, continuing to endorsing DOGE-USD? Perhaps he has a private interest in DOGE? If it is determined that this is the case, his actions warrant removal by the non-existent BofD, and sets Tesla up for a legal nightmare. As an occasionally short, I'm loving it. Anyone long TSLA, should be outraged."
"Tesla is going to be slaughtered both fairly and unfairly and the simple reason is advertising $$. When Tesla was a cult the Fan Boys and Elon's manipulative tweets kept the interest high (while simultaneously no other car company was out there advertising EVs), now it's changed and Tesla is at a massive disadvantage: other major car companies have advertising divisions that are fully developed and very effective! .... as a matter of fact they also advertise in ""Car and Driver"" while Tesla does not. Car and Driver (or most all of the other major auto publications) will favour those companies that help pay their bills, like all other major car companies ""Except Tesla"" ... so the solution is for Tesla to advertise ? A: Yes! and NO! Tesla's business model is flawed ---> it does not account and set aside money for advertising whereas the other majors do and are spending it now. So Tesla goes down a bit as they go up a bit in value because of that one simple (but major) factor"

"Long time share holder & Teslanaire here. You gotta love all the maroon Tesla naysayers who continually beech & whine about the company. Back in 2013 when I bought my first batch of Tesla stock, these naysayers were saying that Tesla will be out of business in 3 years and that the Tesla Model S ""doesn't have enough range"".In the mid 2010s, all the naysayers were beeching about how Tesla isn't making a profit.Now that Tesla is making a profit, these naysayers are whining about how Tesla is making money only from regulatory credit. Who give a flying flip about how Tesla makes money, it's STILL MONEY. I wonder if these Tesla naysayers whine about how Coke makes a big portion of their profit from product merchandising instead of making actual softdrink?Now that the range of the Model S is 400+ miles and will approach 500 soon, the naysayers are whining about the shape of the new Model S and X airplane style yoke steering wheel. Next thing you know they'll be complaining about how the tires of Tesla vehicles are ""Too Round""..."
Most major car companies will produce electric vehicles which are more affordable than Tesla. VW alone will dig into Tesla’s profits in North America and Asia. When the other majors kick in Tesla stock will suffer. I like the company but this trend is imminent.

"I wonder if the whole EV bubble will burst the way the self-driving car bubble did? Clearly we are 10 years or more (maybe never) away from true, self-driving cars navigating the US' crazy streets. But the EV take-over seems to have been equally, unrealistically pumped. Too expensive, cost not coming down, and Biden seems to have lost most of his credibility over the Afghan debacle, so it will be harder to get his infrastructure initiatives passed. Even if EV rebates are restored, a lot of upgrades to electric grid and charging network have to happen before most car owners could charge at home. If you take the top 5% of wage-earners out of the equation, there are a lot of hurdles to make EVs affordable and practical for everyone else. If the transition to EVs happens in the US, it will happen much slower than anticipated."
Panasonic bought 1.4 millions shares at $25.15 a share when Tesla IPO in 2010. They just sold all shares at once. They know this price is too good to be true. TSLA will only go down from here.

"Tesla quality?Took delivery of a 2021 Model Y last December. Had a 17 item check list in hand (from the Internet) of flaws to look for. Close inspection showed that not one of these items applied to this Tesla. The car was perfect. Has 7,000 miles on it now with zero car service cost. In over a half century of driving many different makes and models it’s the best one ever owned. Have two ICE vehicles sitting unused and not been in a gas station since before last Christmas. Those that believe what its detractors say more than likely don’t own a Tesla and/or ever driven one. Have never talked to Tesla owner (see lots of them at Superchargers) that said they were sorry they bought and will never own another ICE vehicle. Still learning of its special features all the time."

"Tesla crashes. Any vehicle death is a tragedy, no matter the vehicle . NHSTA’s Special Case Investigation program provides in-depth and detailed data on on specific crashes They only pick to do about 100 a year. “The SCI program's flexibility allows for investigations of new emerging technologies related to automotive safety. A number of incidents involving alternative fuel vehicles, passenger side air bag deployments, vehicle-to-pedestrian impacts, and child restraint systems have been investigated. These anecdotal SCI cases are utilized by NHTSA and the automotive safety community to understand the real world performance of emerging systems.”There are currently 18 SCI investigations this year about Teslas. These are “anecdotal”. But there are thousands more fatality cases reported on by the NHTSA that involve ICE vehicles. The agency has the duty to investigate BEV incidents. But to keep it in perspective there are far fewer of them. It seems Teslas are getting focused SCI attention, 18% of their cases !"

And it was after that peak that Apple, LG and Samsung entered the cell phone market- just like how Toyota and some other heavy weights haven't entered the EV market as of yet.

"Folks, Tesla had a great run this week that's a fact. Up more than 10 % is a week is quite an accomplishment. The fact that there are massive weekly call volumes for Friday 6/25 means that there is going to be a huge selloff tomorrow afternoon, because nobody has been selling, it's going to be epic. Also, the world's largest car market is China. Local players, and some of the majors are making it tough for Tesla to compete over there this quarter. Tesla had Robust China sales in q1, and still was barely profitable. With Btc tanking, and an end to the EV rebates in the infrastructure bill, it makes you wonder what the future holds?Take profits and don't end up holding Elon's bag."
Great gain today! 2.5%. Of course NIO is having another 5% day...he he he.

"If you like autonomous trucks, you should checkout NGAB. They just announced a merger with Embark who create the software for self-driving trucks. As a comparison, TuSimple is currently trading at more than 3x the valuation of NGAB. TuSimple is in the same business at the same (or less) point of development, so their valuations should be the same. This points to a 3x upside on the NGAB stock."
“ Tesla Dealt Big Blow as Almost All Cars in China Need Safety Fix”Writes yahoo finance. It was such a big blow they already issued the software update to placate the Chinese concerns about the non existent safety issue. (Yawn) The FUDs getting ridiculously obvious now.
700 is the next Floor
"Hype days are over. Check back when (if?) Tesla actually builds and starts selling production Cybertrucks - talk talk talk. Let's see it. How does it stack up? Fit, finish and quality? Real cost? Is it profitable? Comparison to Lightning and R1T? Towing, Hauling, jobsite? A homerun is already baked into the stock price - based on - nothing tangible.Let face it - this was the pivotal vehicle 'announcement' that took the stock to astronomic valuations. Here we are almost 2 years later. WHERE IS IT?????It's like putting a 250% down payment on a new house (25 years appreciation baked in before cement poured) and staring at an empty weedy lot 2 years later - acceptable to you? Builder tells you he's going through 'construction hell'. Meanwhile your neighbors are moved in and swimming in the pool already."

FSD is problem solved. Tesla solved vision. Applications of AI vision go far beyond full self driving cars. Tesla is not a car company. It's an AI company. The cars are only the platform for AI to operate on. This alone is worth more than it's current valuation. Most people won't realize it until it's too late. But some do.

I can see a future when you will be able to charge your Tesla in two minutes at the local supercharger. Only problem there will be 50 androids in line in front of you also waiting to be charged up.
Let's GO Tesla!!!!!!
It looks like Tesla will be starting their own green coin called starcoin according to elon tweets.

I sometimes wonder how those calling Tesla a fraud deal with that much cognitive dissonance. Must be a strain on their mental health. Tesla sells the best car in the world for a fraction of the price of the second best. (And returns 40% on operating assets in the process)
Up to 1500

"The breakout continues Bitcoin is in the process of seeing a ""volatile reset""after the correction.moving between dips and rises is a typical neutral outlook which makes it a tough decision for Investors to decide how best to utilise the current market ; as for me it can't be more obvious that investing Bitcoin in a great platform is way more lucrative than just hodling and waiting for the price of Bitcoin to skyrocket. I didn't think it was possible to make steady profits from investing till I came across Ms Beatrice Heather’s program for Investors who lack understanding on how Bitcoin works,since last year till date | have made over 6BTC from my initial 1.4BTC with Ms Beatrice help. She’s accessible on telegram via https://t.me/cmabheather"
No other like Tesla and Elon in my view will make it known the OEMs and new companies into the sector are so far behind they will need a magnified windshield to even get a glimpse of them in this race. Soley the data Tesla has mined may be worth half what the share price is today topping more of their data and technology on top of their technology is going to be devastating to all others. Tesla could and should double without much if any resistance before the end of this year.Target price within the next 6 months $1200.
"So nice of NIO to help pull TSLA up with them today, but if you feel a tug, don't hesitate to cut the line. $TSLA"
"The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and falling trend in the short term and further fall within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to fall -13.41% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $454.58 and $589.11 at the end of this 3-month period. Do note, that if the stock price manages to stay at current levels or higher, our prediction target will start to change positively over the next few days as the conditions for the current predictions will be broken."
"Started buying my first batch of Tesla stock way back in 2013.

Wanted to dump all of my Tesla share quite a few times, but decided to hang in there instead.Was rewarded for my tenacity & patience in 2020 when my Tesla shares made me a millionaire. Big Grin!"

"Don’t listen to losers, recall is not technically a recall no one actually needs to bring in their vehicles to do over the air update, on Wednesday Tesla will release Q2 deliveries and y’all will wet your pants  oh and Q3 is practically sold out"
"Listened to Musk regarding Cyber Truck. I haven't heard that much back peddling since Fred Flintstone missed a turn while running late for a Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes meeting. A few in 2021? Elon, we call those prototypes builds. Tesla still does not have a feasible design, yet we were promised it would be revealed LAST November."
$TSLA is a true American success story. I don?t think it will EVER be repeated at least in my lifetime. It is a shame that this is not celebrated on every level from the employees to the investors to the general public and to the worldSeriously. #$%$ is wrong with people.
under $250 is a good buy for me....
why isn't this spiking after ai day!
"Three years ago, Elon guided that Tesla would be building 2 million cars in year 2021. Gigafactory is their overwhelming advantage, he says. Yet here we are, struggling to make 750K, and Musk is claiming that batteries are the bottleneck (Primary reason for Semi delay and Plaid + demise), despite buying additional batteries from outside suppliers (LG Chem and CATL), as well as joint venture with Panasonic. Either it's the biggest SNAFU in company history, or Elon flat out lied."
Man the bashers really dry up when TSLA regains upward momentum.
$TSLA is setting up for a bull run letssss goooVery bullish on this one https://marketdeepview.com/2021/08/27/tesla-tsla-stock-has-low-trading-volume-but-high-potential/
Going nowhere. The EV thing is played out. Just a few rich people and movie stars buying EVS trying to look Kool and woke
"As Street analysts do “channel checks” to update 2Q $TSLA models (i.e., call IR and see if they’ll say anything), 2Q (205K) and FY’21 (866K) vol ests likely to move higher given strong M-Y demand in US/China. I am at 2Q Adj EPS $1.05 (Street $.95) and FY’21 $5.20 (Street $4.50)."

I just love how if Tesla has one single problem they get 100 percent criticism but just about everything they are criticized for are the same issues or similar issues other automakers face in the same industry. But guess what nobody puts it on a front page. I wonder why? Let's ask that wonderful question of why that is so we can see the truth. And also I find it funny that more bad news is put out about them vs good news. I wonder why?
Sandy Munro speaks truth Long Tesla (all the best people are)
Who think it will move to 700 soon?
Other companies talk about EVs Tesla actually builds and sells them. Anyone being honest can see this
TSLA will hit 1200. Also I just bought BAP at 118.xx This bank of South America is solid. They beat last Q1 last month and still under this price. SHORT SQUEEZE will start soon. Watch. I also added some DLTR here.
No EV tax rebate in Bidens plan unfortunately
"“O ye of little faith”. Tesla and its genius cofounder (a mere mortal, not a deity) is unstoppable. Though just one tech/BEV enterprise of many Tesla pioneered the modern BEV. Once affordable BEVs take hold a purging of the system’s billions of the now deposable ICE vehicles (and the machines that made them) will happen. Fossil fuel interest will diversify and adapt. New jobs will abound in green energy and for mitigating the century old environmental damage to the Earth. Paying for this? Oil is expensive. An offshore oil/gas platform cost up to $650 million each. This same amount would build over 32 20 MW wind farms. Or at $1 million per MW build 650 MW of solar electric power.All this creating no emissions. It will take new and legacy manufacturers to do this before 2030."

Production and revenue will grow by 20%-50% per year, but the stock price will stagnate until Tesla's P/E aligns with other high-tech and/or auto and/or S&P companies. Dead money."

I was wondering what that glow on the horizon was while talking my golden retriever on a stroll last night on Huntington Beach."

"This week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Biogen’s Aducanumab, a drug targeting amyloid plaque buildup in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. As many families know all too well, Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease during which patients can lose both their memories and their abilities to perform daily tasks. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of people aged 65+ suffering from Alzheimer’s disease in the US will nearly triple during the next 50 years, from an estimated 5.8 million people today to 14 million in 2060. The approval of Aducanumab was surprising for several reasons:Broad Label: Doctors will be able to prescribe Aducanumab for any Alzheimer’s patients whether they suffer from mild or severe forms of the disease. This broad label was a surprise because the clinical trial included only patients suffering from a mild form of Alzheimer’s.Cost: Aducanumab will cost $56,000 annually, a high sticker price given its low efficacy.Toxicity: In its approval, the FDA seemed to place little to no emphasis on toxicity, which is puzzling because Alzheimer’s patients will have difficulty communicating ill effects to their families and care givers.Clinical Benefit: Biogen will have nine years to complete the trial and demonstrate that Aducanumab delivers clinical benefit.Imaging Requirements: By the end of their first year on Aducanumab, patients will have to undergo an MRI instead of a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to confirm beta-amyloid, the drug’s target.Advisors: Three of the nine advisors on the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee - Aaron Kesselheim, Joel Perlmutter, and David Knopman – stepped down following the approval.If the FDA seems to be approving therapeutic agents targeted at diseases with high unmet needs before confirmatory trials end, we believe the value of other such therapies showing little clinical efficacy could be much higher than most investors expect.$crsp $arkg $tsla"
"So the clueless rubes over at GM (Mary Barra & company) are now saying that they'll spend $35 BILLION on their EV program in the hopes of catching to Tesla. Sorry GM, but it's too little, too late.

Longs You can attempt to hide the truth but recall is a safety issue. the cruise control can accidentally activate causing sudden unintentional acceleration.Fixing it by OTA do not change the fact.This mean tesla will pay an unknown numbers of crash and fatalities in china and maybe in the globe.
It will probably go up after deliveries and down after earnings again lol.
Tesla added a Ford to its market cap in the last two days in spite of the fact that Ford has a much a better EV truck to offer and a seven motor Mach E that Elon Musk is afraid to race in his Plaid. Very sad!

Is Tesla going to come down and fill that gap?
"Jan 2017((( Tesla to transition from ‘Enhanced Autopilot’ to ‘Fully Self-Driving’ as soon as ‘3 to 6 months’, says Elon )))"
"TSLA will break 700 today. Classic.!!!. Also I bought BAP, Zillow (Z)"
GOING TO 730 TODAYS BOYS AND GIRLS.
"Anyone notice Yahoo always features Tesla bashing articles and even when it's good news, it's done in a backhanded manner. Just like how Yahoo keeps messing with this message board. Tesla in inevitable, folks. Deal with it!"
"Europe #1 - VW sold 77,373 EVs YTD #2 - Stellantis sold 42,987 #3 - Renault sold 33,561 #4 - Tesla sold l 29, 702"
"Everyday, closer to $30 again. Small market cap, no debt. Awesome presentation from Lordstown week. This is like buying $TSLA or $NIO in the single digits."
"2003 Lexus introduces self parking2020 Tesla tries and fails Consumer reports tested a Tesla autopark system and found that it worked inconsistently, often didn’t park straight, and it doesn’t recognize parking spots consistently.Conclusion: Tesla is ahead of everyone."
"Elon Musk goes where he is most needed. Be it Fremont, Boca Chica, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Austin, Berlin or anywhere. He can do this because he has hand-picked leaders looking after each of those interest. He is instantaneously updated on all their activities. Each of those sections of Tesla are managed by not only competent but dynamic, brilliant and loyal people. They have the same goals as Elon Musk. Tesla is loaded with talent. It is one of the most sought after employer/job positions. They are inundated with resumes and filled out applications. Tesla only hires the pick of the crop quickly letting go those who don’t perform. Wish the US government operated that way. Tesla will do just fine no matter what."
sold TSLA and bought X. Undervalued and lots of potential. More profitable than TSLA. X will earn $2 billion.
Can someone please unscramble the TSLA board? Please!
when does TSLA report is quarterly production numbers this month?
Bag holding $760 average :(
Once again we will see that Tesla cannot show a profit without regulatory credit sales.
"4680, structural battery, alien tech carbon wrapped rotor, 3 piece car, 9 IDRA Giga Press, 2 new Giga factories, and one Elon. Win."

Some Good analyst put a target of $1000 by December 2021.
It seems like investors are more excited Bout the solar industry than ev cars.

Ups on a down day. Nice!
"I bought yesterday and woke up this morning with 300,000 vehicles being recalled. My luck"
"I’ve had my 2021 model 3 for about 3 weeks now . Over 3.5k miles already . Can’t get over it still , such a fun car.!"
This will hit 700+ tomorrow
"Tesla in my opinion is without a doubt a buy right now. If you have been around Tesla at all for the last year, this past weeks run up could only be half or a quarter of a complete bull run. Musk announced AI day being Aug 19th that's still 2 weeks away, right after having a positive earnings with positive forward looking guidance. If you think this is the end of the pump and dump scheme I believe your wrong. We have seen tesla pumped way harder before. There are technical gaps above 800 that need to be filled, and AI day after good earnings and positive guidance is a good build up for pumping this back up to 800 area or higher, lots of money trapped up there and this is a good opportunity for big boys to get it back, maybe more. EV is on the brink of a big break through across the board. With Tesla being the leader of EV, AI announcements could be a huge catalyst for EV period. Elon has been talking full autonomy forever now, plaid gone, new car could be announced, progress on cyber truck, battery improvements, Lidar upgrades, new partners, I could go on and on. Plus if you see bitcoin take off again, i have a feeling people load up on teslaWith Michael Burry in the back of big boys minds, they are going to work overtime to get this as high as they can near term to get all they can out of this. Long term, Tesla fair value is under 500. but I don't think the dump comes until after AI day, and i believe we see 800 before then. But who knows, one tweet could change everything. Long term puts for protection. Sorry, little unorganized on my writing, I'm on my third cup of coffee today lol"
Where is this stock going to be December 2021? Forecasts??
"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold AAPL not too long ago.IF That Money Invest to TSLA; What TSLA will be?....Go to MOON!!!Why?Global Top Companies (AAPL,AMZN,GOOG,MSFT, and so on) are Following TSLA.What TSLA Sees; What Global Top Companies Sees."
((( ... the new charging station in Tibet may prove to be an important milestone for Tesla. ))) I would call it a game changer ... or an example of Telsa being forced into small markets because the large ones are saturated and they NEED to keep the growth story alive so that insiders can continue to sell shares.
The alchemy pay the alchemy pay boss !!
700 close today
I think the market is manipulated by big hedges. :( They dumped a bit to make us nervous and sell and then buy it at lower prices. Lucky I didn’t sell any.
Buying TSLA here at 20 MA on Daily Chart. Good Luck
FSD is awesome if you want to check out how it works look at apple/GM/Ford/VW website. Not Tesla’s though because they don’t have it and never will

"Buy Tesla shares get ""friends and family"" stock pricing when Starlink goes public. Genius!!!The possibility of receiving priority stock allocations in a promising IPO could make Tesla's stock more attractive to investors seeking exposure to the emerging space industry. That's particularly true for those wishing to own what analysts say is the most valuable part of SpaceX's business. Morgan Stanley, for one, believes Starlink could be worth more than $40 billion."
Model Y is almost sold out for Q3
Who bought $NIO or $TSLA in the single digits???? That's right.
The World as we know it today could be getting closer to end days Spiritually and many people from over 2000 years ago died due to toxicity and chemicals in the glassware they used for drinking. What goes around comes back around....
Tesla should acquire Microvision and then own and incorporate the very best lidar and AR technologies in the world.
"#1 - VW group = 206,400 EV sales in the EU over last 12 Months#2 - Renault = 137,500 #3 Hyundai/Kia = 112,800....... Tesla's dominance in the US EV niche didn't carry over to Europe."
"Tesla's revenue is 23% of Daimler's revenue.Tesla's market cap is 786% of Daimler's market cup.In terms of quality, Tesla is by far behind Mercedes, at least in Europe everybody knows it.Don't you, Tesla fanatics, think something is a little bit wrong?"
"--- Mazda' new platform will underpin five hybrids, five plug-in hybrids, and three EVs. ---- Interesting. Ultimately this is the only way to make EVs profitably. You have to build several models on a common platform and then hope the market likes what you are offering."
"TSLA vehicle is over-priced. TSLA stock is too much over-priced. Many other competitors will offer much lower prices for their EVs. EV's will be mass produced by many companies, domestic and international"
"Top executives are selling.What does this mean for my investment?Sell as quickly as possible.overvalued pig with massive problems and expected pressure from Chinese government in next months.Target is 80 usd, micchael bury has build up the biggest short position ever."
"TSLA NFLX AAPL after split, OMG!"
You will never see this dip gain when tsla shoots up to 700!!! People will dream that they bought at this price ! Long and Strong !!! I trust Tsla and ELON !!!
"Teslas market share will never exceed 10%. That would already make Tesla as big as VW today is in ICE. With 30% EV Ev in 2030 Tesla will then sell 2,1 million cars. All these 50% increases over 5+ yeras are a _lie_. and easy to check."
"Before turning in for the night in a high rise, check for a parking garage firebomb."
Little pullback after the run it will cross 700 next week before gaping up at 800 steady so just buy and hold for now
I am responding again. Do not delete my post. It is not an investment stocks. It is gambling. Unfortunately

Road to $700 plus !!
TSLA boarding time
"I believe that Elon will have a special reward for us on Space X plan!!! Also, he is making tsla back to moon soon! Im going big again today !!! I love Elon and tsla!! My great investment ever!!!"
"YASU, where are you? I'm in desperate need of Tesla FUD. Give it to me"
This thing has been going down steadily for 6 months. It's time to cut some losses. It doesn't seem to be picking up at all. I'm very conservative in how I invest and don't panic but for this one it's time to cut my losses and invest in something more solid and make up for my losses.
"I don't often mute posters, but when I do..., I mute those with relentless political agendas, and have a stuck CAP LOCKS button, and a obsession with obnoxious an animated gifs. (I don't even want to imagine what made it stick, but most likely is the product of watching a video of Elon dancing)."
Wonder what Elon Musk has to say about Baby Doge Coin (BabyDoge)
Have you bought yesterday? I told you not to...Remember: averaging down in a company with serious issues is never a good strategy.
"order in for 30,000 shares...."
NIO is popping. Climb on board.Heading to $300+ Dump $TSLA Buy $NIO
"Tesla is a bubble.There is no reason to invest in a car company like TESLA with P/E ratio 600 when you have GM P/E Ratio 10 , FORD P/E Ratio 15 , Toyota P/E Ratio 13.Even if TESLA will kick out all American car makers off the market that sold last year 3.500.000 cars stock at $600 is still extremely overpriced. Unfortunately this stock market doesn't make sense at all. AMC stock at all time high when Movie Theaters were closed for almost a year. Let's hope it get back to reality soon."
"ARKK funds holding this morningJune 21 - 3,509,418Guru."
anyone know what day the production numbers come out?
All I know is my wife and I saw 140+ tesla trucks traveling through eugene OR. We stopped counting after that. It's probably close to 180 trucks full of tesla cars. Far more than any other cars being delivered. Tesla is still a buy from me.
1K at the end of the year..
"Lack of Elon tweets, Should have shorts nervous. He's upto something."
"PLUG & $FCEL profit taking, still think $TSLA takes out one of them!ACRX chart looking interesting, ACRX appears to be *BREAKING-OUT* w/ ACRX reporting about a dozen MILESTONES later in 2021, do your Due Diligence on ACRX!"
From FUD to FOMO in 1.99 seconds.
Electric charging stations are popping up all over America. Electric cars are about to take over the usa probably by next year 2022
"A good baggie holds their bags till the end, even when 90% of the capital is lost. Be a good baggie and hodl"
"I find it funny how caught up everyone is in the robot stuff, did no one else appreciate all of the DOJO and FSD advancments and tech?"
"Did anyone really think inflation wasn't increasing. If you did, you haven't been buying anything the last six months. It's no surprise."
Minor tech problem limited to almost all cars manufactured in China and imported into China. Tesla leads in hi tech screw ups.
I don’t care what people think Tesla still the best car in the world in two months Tesla will be at least double the price plus every time they talk about Tesla Tesla goes up￼ In my city I used to see Tesla car every month driving by now every day I see hundreds of cars of Tesla and it’s small city￼ God willing Tesla will stay for a long time number one right on the top

"Hey shorts, how are you? :-D Still waiting for TSLA bankruptcy?"
How do we lose $13 in minutes on no news?
Break 660 and this takes off
"Shorts borrowed 400,000 more REKR shares this morning and failed to dip the price (so dips are opportunities). LETS ROLL! Great things happening at Rekor -- how many young companies land deals with $TSLA, $MA, $VRRM, every border contractor, state governments, local governments, and various other corporations? Listen to Warren Buffett, buy good companies at a good price and hold them (dont trade). I am dreaming of a $GME like squeeze! LOL Have a great day!"
$AEI ALSET homes is Tesla spelled backwards and today announced their partnership with $TSLAHint: look at the Logos. They’re the same.

"In the news Tesla recalled almost 300,000 BEVs, some imported, but those mostly built in China. It was a cruise control item that was easily corrected by a free software update either remotely or in person at a Tesla Service Center."
"Bob Tasca goes 8.1 sec in the 1/4 mile, 171 mph and breaks the speed record! Very proud of him and the Ford/Ford Performance engineering teams! Electric Mustangs are fast, way to go team!Plaid? 9.2"
Family is buying two plaid models with retirement $$ real deal $TSLA
I wish we could sit all the bashers down in a big movie theater and watch Sandy Monroe disect the new electric Ford. When Sandy worked for Ford back in 82 he was trying to get them off of a leaky style hose connection that the new mustang uses THIRTY SIX of. Not to mention all the other points he tries to suppress his emotions over.
Tsla shorts never learn  they still think tsla is a car company 
"very nice, wanted 2-3% but got a little more"
"It looks like the Q2 results will end the sideway move of the stock price.There is a good chance we'll see $700 price soon after Q2 earning announcement.Remember. get in, think long, ignore short term noises, stay calm and enjoy the ride up. Cheers."
