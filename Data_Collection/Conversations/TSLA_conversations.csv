I bought TSLA after it traded above 800 and the stock split 2 for 1. Looking at a double soon. Typically I would sell half and play with house money but TSLA is still in the early innings. Stay long.
"Price increases today on Model 3 and Model Y. Just curious...when is the $35,000 Model 3 coming out? Maybe tonight Elon will give an update on that, along with when the years overdue semi-truck and cyber trucks will come out. And the robo-taxis, and L5 autonomous vehicles that owners can p*mp out at night. Just strictly from a legal standpoint, how long can Musk keep the CyberTruck reservations without delivering a product? And will Tesla have to return all the FSD money if they never provide full self driving vehicles? Inquiring minds want to know."
"Market will realize soon that Tesla is undervalued and will double in value soon. They lead in every metric in EVs. Sales, Superchargers, reliability, growth, safety, autonomous driving, batteries, software and updated, solar, battery storage and virtual"
"Based on Tesla's 1.3 million delivery number for 2022 & $7,000 net profit per vehicle, Tesla earns over 9 Billion in profit in 2022. Tesla is drastically undervalued by the market. A double is incoming in 2022."
"I need everyone's input here....is TSLA going higher between now and the of the year? Because if it is, I'm going to buy shares."

"Tesla the money machine! Bought another load of shares last week, made another load of profit. Thank you Elon Musk for making my family financially secure."
"I started my journey in 2015. I was all over the place! Stocks, indexes, options.. you name it, I was trying to learn it. Then I heard about FX & how it is ""so hard to trade"". I wanted to learn all I could. Then I started learning about charts & different time frames, EMA's, SMA's, Bollinger Bands, MACD, etc, etc... The more I learned, the more confused I got (information overload)!! I tried several strategies. Some kind of worked, most didn't. Along my journey, I found (don't laugh) NADEX & fell in love with Binary Options. It all made sense to me. I also found Marc on instagram & started using his strategy, which is very simple, now I can say I’m a big earner.You can reach him via t**elegram》or Whats》App +1(718) 550-9926"
"What happened with Musk's bragging about how he was going to build ""alien dread naught machine-building-the-machines"" factories where production of cars was going to be so fast ""wind resistance"" was going to be a problem for the machines on the assembly line? He was going to show all the other auto manufacturers how to build cars, removing humans from the production-line, so the line could move at ""faster than human speeds."" Now Musk is worrying about being able to hire enough assembly-line workers?"
"This is exactly the kind of result anticipated by Cathy wood to forecast the stock to $3000 in 2 years. When TSLA delivered the desired result, stock should definitely go up. Thats obvious."
Tesla raising prices yet again. Demand is out of control.

"All you Ford and GM fan boys need to remember that the original model S that was launched in 2012 , still beats anything that these manufacturers have built today."
Had my Tesla Y P in for cracked windshield. Took the time since she has not been back to the dealership since last year in September win I picked her up. She has ran like a very nice and fast clock. No issues. They added new tires and service updates. Service was very professional and the drop off pick up is the best I have ever experienced with a vehicle service. Overall very happy with my Tesla Car and the Care given by the Service Department. I will be buying more Tesla stock this week.
Let’s see if we can break and hold above $800 ahead of earnings! $TSLA
Enron was another energy sector disruption company that was a great stock until the cooked books were exposed. Does anyone post where all the stock options for all the employees are booked in the quarterly financials ???
But remember CNBC said GM is taking market share from Tesla? GM's sales are down 33% this quarter while Tesla's are up 74%. How is that possible??? 
"So Texas’ “no income tax” is a great move for Musk’s billions but not so good for a 10,000 person workforce with no vaccine mandate"
