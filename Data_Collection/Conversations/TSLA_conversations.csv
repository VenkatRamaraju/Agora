"People stop bashing Tesla yes 200k cars for a 650 billion dollar company is nothing, but it should be a million cars this year and maybe even two million in two years, company is growing at a fast pace, if you want to day trade then day trade, hold it long then hold it, but stop bashing and trashing others, I am Tesla long but I did sell all of my shares on Friday at 698.50 got lucky I guess, regardless I am getting more soon as we hit resistance, Tesla has more to grow and improve and they will"
"Tesla’s competition is still missing important points. Supercharger stations are popping up all over. Faster than the early gas stations. Any other brand BEV will offer less charging options. They are still not advancing autonomy fast enough. Tesla is still on target for 50% production and sales growth each year. Gigafactorie’s Shanghai ramp up, Austin and Berlin starting and Fremont lowering cost and increasing manufacturing efficiency. All lead to meeting those growth expectations. Demand (large back orders on Model Y) continuing unabated. The new flagship cybertruck first production this year. TSLA is still on track, strong and a long term winner."

"Tesla Cruise Control UpdateCathie believe Tesla will have full self driving in four years. That raise a couple of question in my mind. Who will not have full self driving by 2025? Will they purchase the technology from Waymo? When will Tesla owners file that imminent lawsuit for the fraudulent time frame? Still going to be fun to watch Tesla retrofit the old cruise control and replace it with one from Waymo. ""Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management, which had a 0.6% stake in Tesla as of March 31 and is an ardent backer of the company, remains steadfast in its support despite the stock’s showing this year. Ark expects it to benefit from rising electric vehicle sales and sees even odds that it will deliver fully self-driven cars in four years."""
Can't keep this down. $2 billion market cap. That's like buying $TSLA and $NIO in the single digits. Hub motor with extremely low maintenance is going to win in the long run.
Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) is up by almost 11% over the last week (five trading days) and currently trades at about $690 per share

Looks good to me. Record quarter deliveries with additional manufacturing capacity not yet up and running. I do expect Tesla to blow away full year delivery estimates as the new capacity will be all gravy on top current full year estimates.
"All TSLA nay sayer, I sold my 5 Series BMW yesterday to make room in my garage another TSLA Model 3, July 12 delivery date! You nay sayers go other Box car manufacturers; TSLA will be few Trillions $ market value ...."

A 12 Year old Toyota Prius ( although a hybrid ) still has TWICE the range of a brand new Tesla. For half the price. LoLWhat a FARCE Tesla is.
"((( Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Johns Hopkins University in the spring of 2011. She brought with her a machine she said could test tiny samples of blood for dozens of conditions and thick binders of data to show its accuracy. A Hopkins scientist told her that his researchers needed to put the device in their Baltimore laboratory to verify the technology on Walgreens’ behalf, and Ms. Holmes agreed to provide one, say people familiar with the meeting. It never happened. ))) ((( CEO Elon Musk explained how the team is set to follow a three-step process to get its vehicles offering rides to people. The company plans to enable every Tesla vehicle built since October 2016, all of which have been fitted with a suite of cameras and sensors, to upgrade its software and computer to support point-to-point autonomous driving with no human taking over. This, in turn, will enable the car to offer rides to members of the public autonomously – all without requiring a human driver. )))It never happened."
"The recall includes 35,665 imported Model 3 vehicles and 249,855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in Tesla's factory in Shanghai. Customers will not be required to return the vehicles. Instead, they will receive a free software update either remotely or in-person to resolve the issue."

"Underwhelming Q2 Deliveries, Plaid Fire, 4680 not working, CyberTruck in jeopardy, vision only Autopilot delayed every two weeks for many months now. China, NHTSA and SEC regulatory issues, and Musk posting more and more crazy stuff on twitter. Likely negative Q2 with $BTC losses and no EV credits. $TSLA Q2 deliveries are 201k while their production capacity was 340k. Whether it was chip shortage, production issues or demand issue. Europe had lower demand where Tesla is 6th with 9% market share.Plaid fire  might be a big disaster in the making. The 4680's weren't going to make it, so $TSLA rushed an 18650 solution into production. Once again, no time for proper validation so they hand it to the customer for Beta testing.Customers without radar and vision only autopilot -- another major issue.Europe saleshttps://eu-evs.com/public/bestSellers/ALL/Groups/Quarter/2021/2Worldwide salehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-production-123400427.html$NIO, $XPEV $GM and take over china, While $vwagy takes Europe.

"A Tesla Model S Plaid burst into flames, yet driver walks away unscathed, is a another testimony as to how safe Teslas are. TSLA to 'da moon!"
So longs got their $700 today. Hope you sold at $700. You won't see it again in your lifetime.
"Well Q2 is done and there has been a lot of volatility this quarter. It will be exciting to see how things play out, but here is the marker that I have been following for a long time . . . Tesla had a great month in Norway!! They have worked hard to rise from mediocrity in the early part of the quarter to once again take the top spot for the best selling model in the month, quarter and year!!! Amazing! (That's for you Cbeee)But wait. VW didn't outsell them with the ID.4, the ID.3 or the UP! or the the Golf. On the YTD, even VW didn't. Neither did Skoda or Seat. Well, unless you put them all together. The Skoda Enyaq is just an ID.4, and on a YTD basis, the Skoda Enyaq/ID.4 is still outselling the Model 3. That also doesn't include Audi or Porsche.I did make an incorrect assumption a week or so ago before my last foray into the off grid world . . . that Tesla's YTD market share would remain around 10%, but it is really closer to 12%, so they really pulled something off. But on a brand level, VW's was 14%, so the competition is definitely in play.If you look at Norway, Netherlands and Spain. Tesla finished the quarter with 10.6% share and VW with 12.4% share, but the number of competitors with significant sales is rising. Notably the Mustang is doing very well in it's first quarter.When looked at by Autogroup, The VW group finished the quarter with 28.74% share vs. 10.6% share in Norway, Netherlands and Spain. Stellantis also outsold Tesla with 10.64% share, and Hyundai tried, but only got to 9.6%The world of BEVs continues to get more crowded and there is a lot to see with China numbers, US sales, Model S/X deliveries and average prices . . . Good luck with your decisions. Remember, car companies sell for 1x revenue . . . next up, watch the depreciation.Guru."
"if you are short, watch out for pre-earnings squeeze. it could go to $760s..."
