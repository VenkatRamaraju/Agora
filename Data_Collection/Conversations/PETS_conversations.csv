"Missed estimates on the last 2 Q’s ER’s. Will they turn it around this Q? If so, shorts will be surprised."
Made the mistake of taking a look at their website. Got bombarded with PetMed Express banner ads for the rest of the day until I cleared my browser. It was pretty annoying.
"Sold out today $28.15 for a quick trade which I don't normally do, but plus 7% in one day, I decided I would take it. Hope to get in lower, but if not that's OK."
"If you make the assumption that PETS is going to be a non growing dividend payer going forward then the way I look at it is you compare it to a 10 year treasury and add a risk premium because it's not as safe as a treasury. If it's only one stock of many in your portfolio then the historical risk premium to use is 3%. If it pays out all earnings except what is needed to keep dividend steady then it simply becomes fair value is when yield is 3% more than treasuries or today 1.45% + 3% or when yield on PETS is 4.45% or stock is at $24 at today's treasury rate.I am trying make the point that if you think business is sound enough that dividend will continue to be paid it can be as simple as adding 3% to 10 year treasury yield. If you want to be more conservative you can use 4 or even 5% spread. Current spread is 5.5%.We are in low interest rate world. Vanguard utility fund pays only 2.8% and their REIT fund pays 3.8%. They don't have single stock risk but they do have risk because utilities and twits use leverage.Our biggest challenge is knowing what the future of PETS business model is. I have decided to not guess and just use what the analyst estimates are. Right now I am saying dividend is sound because of excessive cash on books and earnings estimates are a little over $1.00 this year and next.I could be wrong in my thinking, but with value style investing you try to estimate future cash flows and compare to risk free return and decide if you are confident enough to pull the trigger. Good luck to all traders and investors in a world dominated by Fed and Trumpster."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Well it hit my radar at the 4.5% dividend level. It is an acceptable long term buy I believe with 10 year around 1.2%. Might start taking a position.
Tried to buy at open at Friday close price. Was not meant to be today. I will let order hang out there for a while. Mainly a dividend play at 4.5% in a relatively safe stock
PetMed Express is up 5.31% to 27.78
Someone get this going on Reddit . Great company needs a major boost
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached on TELEG.RAM ( stevewarrenfx ) or on WhatsApp: +1 (813) 683‑ 6310"
New CEO - Hulett? Rosetta Stone? What do folks think?
"18 months from now, after the stock markets settle 50% from where they are at now, the government bureaucrats may be talking about ""little green shoots"" coming up from after the drop"
"Short interest over 5 million shares again... 17 days to cover... Debt free, profitable, growing, and 4.5% yield!"
Think I am going to wait a week and see where this going to settle out. Might be a chance to pick up some shares cheap and hope new CEO can get some good things going.
Still think it's unfathomable that all those shorts are willing to pay the dividend every quarter. No other stock comes close to this anomaly of paying an additional 4% to hold shares short of a profitable debt free company. Hoping new management gets even more aggressive w/ dividend and buybacks...
I think i am more excited than ever to buy in with new staff. I think this is going to be a chewy even better in long term. Meanwhile going to average down and buy more of it and keep it for long. Enjoy the dividend as well. Holding from avg of $43. I think we going to 50s soon
"Looking forward to a new CEO announcement... in the meantime, buybacks and insider buys would go a long way toward investor conviction?"
PetMed Express is down 5.00% to 27.00
"Okay so I've owned this off and on, and I have a real question. Besides the dividend, why is it going up even after missed earnings and 2 year low revenue?"
"I started long term position again at $26.36. Seems to be valued OK, unlike a lot of other things."
