Does anyone know what interest rate shorts are having to pay to borrow shares?
We go ex-div too! Looking forward to DRIP'ing in a couple weeks... ;)
last chance to buy before Mondays earnings report. with 30% short interest good report will send this stock to the moon.
"Anyone have another small company with a clean balance sheet they like? I have about 8% of my portfolio in PETS and would like to find another small company for a long term hold. Small, niche business that is a good long term hold."
Tesla up on Wednesday because they can loose a lot of money real fast I guess. PETS stock down because making money and paying a dividend is not cool anymore.
They have zero debt. Make money and pay me to do nothing. Im rooting for the new C.E.O . very accountable. Money guy makes sense.
22% short interest. The squeeze is inevitable.
Big down day on light volume. Buying on the dip.
Data updated on shorts. Percentage of float short has increased from 61% to 63.5%. Last I looked the max on any stock was around 80%. I guess that means expect more volatility in stock price. With the div and borrowing cost I have to think it's costing 10% per year to short.
I like the company for many reasons. With the improved sales might take a position around $28 - $30.
"Are investors beginning to get smarter? Unlikely. What happened to desire for clean balance sheets, reasonable or low PEs, and PROFITS! PETS is a good company! They make money against some ridiculous competition. Modern day robber barons, scam artists, VCs, investment bankers, et all behind WeWork, Chewy, UBER, etc…can you imagine losing a billion dollars a quarter?! A few people and companies made a pile of dough but most lose! Many of these Unicorns one might conclude...are CONceived to to enrich a few...and the rest well...suckers. Imagine with lockup expiration looming for UBER and Chewy...insiders anxious to cash in...both are down 22% YTD. Recall, Chewy was acquired by PetSmart for $3.35 billion! Who made money? Allen & Co. made money as advisor. The shell game CONtinues. PetSmart transferred 20% of its stake in Chewy to BC Partners and spun off 16.5% of Chewy to an UNRESTRICTED subsidiary. Chewy will lose some $300 million this year. Financial schemes are part of history and the schemes of modern day balance sheet magicians leave Charles Ponzi longing for another run in this game of uniCOrNs."
5.5 million shares short. How they gonna cover that with average volume barely above 500k
"I tried to run thru the financials of this quarter 2018 and adjusting for same sales unit volume but discounted an additional 15%. I said expenses are the same, but taxes are less. I come up with about $0.20 net profit for the quarter. That's lower than the analyst estimates so not sure if I am doing something wrong. If they squeeze a million out of expenses that would get you to $0.25 net per share."
Consensus estimate was $0.38. Company delivers $0.38 and headline reads earnings miss. What a load of #$%$
New CEO - Hulett? Rosetta Stone? What do folks think?
"Most public traded companies have big debts, but PETS has been making money without any debt, and gives good dividend."
"Buyers at this price are ignoring a fact that can’t be ignored. Prior earnings are now irrelevant. PETS earnings will be cut in half this year or worse due to competition that didn’t exist a year ago. First Chewy and now Walmart have come in with much lower prices that PETS has to match or lose share. Those prices are about 15% lower than PETS was charging, which means they lose more than half of their profit margin. The full impact will start to be felt this quarter. The current EPS run rate is about $1.00. A stock with declining revenues and earnings does not get a PE over 10. Buying here is catching a falling knife. Long way down yet and Amazon looms."
Well it hit my radar at the 4.5% dividend level. It is an acceptable long term buy I believe with 10 year around 1.2%. Might start taking a position.
Down to 5k shares available. 25.7 % borrow rate. Buckle up. 10% next week.
Will go back to 50+ were it was last week.
Maybe they should move into the high growth segment of the market?https://www.twst.com/news/darcy-bomford-wants-give-marijuana-supplements-cats-dogs/
Pets has $4 per share ($80M) free cash after debt subtracted......you are now paying $12/shares or about .85x sales for the company's operations. Chewy which is growing faster and doesn't make money is trading at 3x sales. Could Pets' management help Chewy become profitable?
If anyone’s interested I started a subreddit for the stock. Might help being able to share DD/analysis and get the conversation rolling about PETS stock.
Conference call sounded pretty good to me. Sounds like they floated the idea this was bottom as far as gross margins. Teased there might be an announcement in future about working with retailers. Going to continue buying back stock. Off top of my head I think it could be 1 - 2 Million more shares. That might make shorts sweat.
"Wow looking at due diligence into meme names and this looks like best one... 120 mil in cash, no debt, 40 mil net income, 4% dividend, 600 mil market cap and growing revenues.... am I missing something here?"
"Bought some more at the close at $15.42. That's 7% yield, no debt. Might go lower but I will keep nibbling on the way down."
"This is very interesting. Zacks Equity ResearchWed, July 7, 2021, 9:01 AMGIS+0.10%TSN+1.40%As part of the Accelerate strategy, General Mills, Inc. GIS is on track to reshape its portfolio to drive growth. Keeping along this line, the company concluded the previously-announced (on May 14, 2021) acquisition of Tyson Foods, Inc.’s TSN pet treats business. The transaction— which includes the Nudges, Top Chews and True Chews brands — was priced at $1.2 billion on a cash basis"
PETS holding up well in a down market. Hoping this hits $35 before end of year. Not sure if the company is still doing share buybacks. Anyone know?
Question to the experts - #$%$ is happening? Keeps banging against 29 - is that good or bad?I keep thinking it will shoot up suddenly one day once the big guys realize it cannot go down below that level. Am I delusional?
Volumes almost at a million by 10:00. A lot of shorts trying to get out I suppose. I noticed that a lot of people shorted even under $20 so there is some pain going on. Good job by the company to stick to blocking and tackling in the business.
"Conclusion! Making money is still relevant at PETS! History will show that many unicorns are financial engineering gone mad CONceived to enrich a few while the majority of investors are like sheep herded into pens to fatten before auction and slaughter. Imagine a unicorn losing a billion dollars EACH quarter as with Uber. Imagine the outrageous financial gymnastics at WeWork. Imagine Chewy like a marrow bone that your dog has hollowed out. CONsider that BC Partners, the owners of PetSmart, was born out of the collapse of Baring. History will find Internet era robber barons have engineered unicorns for their extraordinary gain. Analysis. Let me paraphrase Bloomberg regarding PetSmart and Chewy...The Most Expense Takeover in Retail History is Drowning in Debt...$3 billion and executives discover that it takes more than web smarts to outrun an avalanche of debt...AND (Bloomberg adds) the acquisition of Chewy will NOT help!! However, as all of these acquisitions, the advisors get paid large fees, insiders get paid, dissect the acquisition, an insurmountable mountain of debt, a measure of which bought some new yachts. Bernie Madoff looks on with envy."
"Standing by for another Reddit run to the 40s like what happened June 2 the 46.06 run. This one will go higher than that if they move out of AMC into PETS, for now shorts seem to be in control ."
"I stumbled across this while looking at CHWY. There aren't many reasonably valued companies in the market, now. I might take a nibble at PETS."
"Morningstar reporting short interest of 36% and a ratio of 11 (days to cover)...Every three months, short sellers owe $1.743 million in dividend ($6.972 million annually)... plus margin interest, plus borrowing fees..."
"My opinion is that PETS is that $17 is pretty close to the bottom for a while. There would have to be some really terrible news for the shorts to drive it down much more. I was long a long time ago, but sold when it peaked around $40. I am going to buy here again with a few thousand shares at $17 or below."
Bought 1000 shares at $28.59....what are the chances that Reddit will do what they did before - sending this back to over $50 ??
PETS has a bigger percent of the float short vs AMC and GME. PETS 35.58% of float short vs 21.13% and 29.34%. This could really take off next couple trading days if the shorts aren't allowed to win. Some capital calls bound to happen.
Saw this on stocktwits: So 95.93% of the shares are owned by Institutions and 3.79 are owned by insiders for a total of 99.72 so that leaves about 2.4 million available with 6.4 million shares short right now. Interesting !
Any thoughts on today's chart? Looks very unnatural.
"Anyone know anything about who the shorts are? Retail investors, hedge funds?"
Holding on tight to my stocks and just added at these prices. I am long with it and I know it will go back up near closing and into tomorrow. Today is last day to hold and get divided on holding this.
"This battle seems to continue at least for the next couple days or weeks, but eventually we longs will win!"
Looks like premarket isn't happy. Great growth but no increase in dividend. Let's see what happens when the market opens.
The fact they raised the dividend 7% is a huge reassurance of where this company is going to me.
Just sold.good luck to all.but I think its better to sell after such a spike.
I think earning was solid. Missed on opportunity of buying it this morning however will be a buyer if drops any further. Definitely great long term hold and dividend doesn’t hurt. Hoping to see $50 someday.
26% of float being short sold.Shorts had better cover their positions now.
"Intetesting action on such a huge beat. Earnings and growth just another reason for Amazon or WalMart to buy them. They would be a perfect fit. Regardless, this drop is just a nice buying opportunity for anyone smart enough to smell the roses."
"$1,773,415.84 of dividend paid out of the accounts of short positions today."
Reading on Bloomberg that Pimco thinks rates on US treasuries could go negative like Europe. If you plug in zero rate on 10 year that puts stock value of PETS at just under $35 based on $1.08 dividends. You can understand at zero people are going to be looking for income producing securities.
"Remember, once they look into Chewy and see their flawed business plan especially with PetSmart running the show, more people will look to PETS and their pristine balance sheet. A double from 17 within 2 years...just watch. Any buyout would obviously speed things up from a shareholder perspective. Again, we may need a new analyst on this stock that may ignite the short squeeze once they start realizing how much of a scam CHWY is. Ill be long PETS / short CHWY. Ill collect the divy and make money on my short sale."
Kind of wonder if we are going to kick ourselves in a few years that we didn't buy more with dividend above 6%. Most of purchases are around 20 but I have been putting small amounts in all the way from 20 to 17.
"Went back and looked at short interest. One year ago when stock was $39, short interest wad only 4.8 million shares. When stock was $15 a couple of weeks ago had 11 million shares. Not rational to me unless hedged in some way.Plus anyone know for sure why stock is moving 6% per day on high volume. I am assuming the volatility is driving more traders to trend trade and float is pretty small. I am still not sure shorts aren't trapped."
"The author makes some very good, and certainly valid points. What I would say though is not to forget about the humanization of animals that is currently happening now. CDPs (crazy dog people) are throwing puppy showers, doggy birthday parties, and buying $600 strollers for their dogs! This is an epidemic that has shown no signs of letting up. The stock price will recover."
So we beat the estimates and everything looked great but we have dropped and tomorrow doesn’t look good. I bought in more today but what is going on? Why did it drop?
"I worked for a private company that took on too much debt and was forced to go public. Bought and sold a few times until part of big 17,000 employee corp. From my experience PETS is in the sweet spot for stock holders. No debt, no need for Wall street anymore. The board's main job is to focus on making sure business is run efficiently ensuring stock holders are rewarded over time.Chewy is opposite. Part of private equity BC Partners with huge junk rated loans and really if I was a stock holder I really couldn't figure out what I really owned but you know you are not top priority to BC Partners as they are going to figure out how they get paid first and bank loans and bond holders next."
Pets and chwy have basically same stock price. What a difference 3 months make. If someone had bought PETS and shorted chwy they would have hit a homerun. Of course a lot of momo traders did the opposite.
I'm in at $28 today.
Tuesday should be a fun trading day for this one ... 39% short interest. Any good news will send this thing flying!
"Short interest over 5 million shares again... 17 days to cover... Debt free, profitable, growing, and 4.5% yield!"
Estimates on stock price plunge or gain after earnings?
time to pay a special $1.50/share dividend
I was out at 40 ... But love love love what this is doing to the shorts
"Clean balance sheet, literally no debt, cash rich, 4% dividend, steady growth, hot area of the market..... I guess the baby really does get thrown out with the bath water."
I think this is no brainer. Not sure why we deflated but we need to push this baby up. I bought in at the highs of today and really hope it shows its true face and we see $100.. honestly the ER was excellent and i didnt get my money in time to buy it right after ER but I believe we will be great short and long term. Amazing potential with this stock going forward.
"18 months from now, after the stock markets settle 50% from where they are at now, the government bureaucrats may be talking about ""little green shoots"" coming up from after the drop"
"The good news is if it can hold here its likely to move up to around $35. The bad new if it can't your looking at $23....This is a volatile stock but with nearly $100M in cash, no debt, 3.8% div, 45% payout, 20M shares outstanding, just 3M float, insider buys to sells 5:1, PE around <14 2019 earnings, $300M rev. So tell me what's not to like here?"
"I am 63 and investor, not trader. Try to read a lot. Read Hussman last night who is a smart and educated economist and has a pretty good record of predicting long term market returns and direction His indicators for market direction flipped mid may and he is now hard negative on market which I assume he is shorting the market in some manner. PETS is a defensive stock. Found correlation tool that shows rolling 60 day correlation with sp500 currently 0.2 which is a little less than long term average. I am going to let my PETS investment ride even though it might drop more with a big market decline, since it's not very correlated to market I am going to let it ride. My expectation is for PETS the dividend is basically your long term return which is pretty good in the world in which we live."
anyone around long enough that knows what caused the drop from $45 in June of 2018 to $15 in June of 2019? I'm interested in taking a position but concerned about the volatility.
Intrinsic value for PETS based on assets and forward earnings is about $18 per share.
"I started long term position again at $26.36. Seems to be valued OK, unlike a lot of other things."
Most heavily shorted stock on the NASDAQ
pets is down due to shorts and not fundamentals. this reminds me of Pershing Square shorting Herbal Life until they couldn't do it anymore. hold strong and stay on course.
Just wait until they start selling CBD oil for pets. It’s a very fast-moving segment in the CBD market add the product helps cats and dogs. I imagine it would make a bird tweet too!
The earnings estimate of $0.26 is high. That is the same as last quarter which is a seasonally high quarter. Meanwhile Walmart entered the space over the summer. Discounts have increased over the past 90 days in response. I project earnings of $0.18. Annualized earnings is under $1.
For a stock that is going to $60-70 this year this is a very dead board.
"PETS was $34.40 a month ago. Now they increased dividend, make more money and still have NO debt."
"8.8% Increase in Fiscal 2021 Sales18.4% Increase in Fiscal 2021 Net Income9.7% Increase in Fiscal 2021 Reorder Sales""...growth in our gross margins by 50 basis points...""7.1% increase in dividend"
"I check out PETS website from time to time which triggers me getting on-line adds. They have gotten more sophisticated with specific products and pricing displayed quickly and different adds over time. It seems like they are doing what has to be done which is spend on marketing and be competitive on price. One thing I always liked about pet meds is they were shipping small, higher priced items. I don't really get the shipping bags of dog food if chewy is going to be doing that. Corrugated packaging is pricey besides the shipping cost. Don't think that's a good model."
"small cap stock which means the market makers can cause wild nonsensical swings. My thought is hold on and enjoy the increased dividend. I bought this stock back in 2011 and have been very impressed with owner/operator since that time. Has anyone ever read the transcripts when he discusses earnings results with analysts? He is professional, but does get in the point the rude analysts can go fudge themselves if they don't like his answers, I love the guy."
"Hot dam, told the wife buy pets meds online, they're cheaper, but she goes and pay triple price at Animal hospital.Never too late I guess."
As Investors Business Daily would say We are on the verge of a breakout.
"Looking forward to a new CEO announcement... in the meantime, buybacks and insider buys would go a long way toward investor conviction?"
"Careful now... volume was 3x avg yesterday...PETS is one of only 10 stocks that fit the following criteria:o % owned by institution > 50%o short interest > 20% outstandingo short interest > 30% floatAnd PETS is the *only* one (w/ absurd short interest) that's debt free, profitable, and paying a handsome dividend."
Predicting a miss on earnings. They'll have to have a healthy increase in revenues to meet expectations and I don't see that happening right now.
Bought another 2000 shares yesterday to double my position. Seems like a cheap stock based on PE with an amazing dividend.
What a gift. I'm expecting at least a 10% rise between now and end of the month.
"Short interest decreased over 1.1 million shares in the second half of January. Would have been that much more interesting had our four insiders not sold shares to them... How greedy do you have to be to sell into panicking shorts and on the eve of ex-dividend? Oh well, looking forward to DRIP on Friday..."
It was a decent quarter nothing fundemental to worry about. The blip was already built into the stock price imo. The balance sheet is strong and trading at 16-17X earnings seems fairly valued with a 3% div. Expect the cash to be used for an accretive acquisition. Id be a strong buyer if it opens down tomorrow anywhere in the low $30's your going to do well.
Just for fun I posted on Chewy that if you like the on-line pets retail space you might want to look at PETS because they make money and pay a dividend. Four thumbs down. We have come a long way that buying a stock isn't about a company making money. Will not end well.
"Great news! Revenues up, margins up, earnings up. They also reduced their inventory and are planning a redesign of their website. Looks great going forward!"
Totally extraordinary to me is that the GameStop saga is about to shed a bright light (today to Congress) on exorbitant shorting/borrowing practices of wall street. And yet certain short positions (like that of PETS) remain steadfast. Gonna be interesting...
"I repeat....whey PETS gets no respect????CHEWY online sales are 1.96 BILLION!!!! that's why its over 100 a share....PETS needs to significantly up their game and become more like the AMZN model like Chewy.....they must figure out how to generate huge online revenue .....they currently are way behind the leaders....until that changes, this company will go no where."
They had some interesting insights about PETS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"The sales decline and $0.26 EPS was worse than even I expected. Remember, this is their busiest quarter. The annual run rate for EPS is now probably $0.75 to $0.90. Inventory was up quite a bit and management is hedging on whether the dividend will continue at this level. What do you value a company earnings $0.75-0.90 EPS with declining sales at? $11, $12ish?"
"Considering starting a position in PETS right around $24, but this one has be baffled to be honest. While sales growth is slow, the company is immensely profitable and the balance sheet pristine. What am I missing? Is there new competition to worry about? Lawsuits? BTW... Should benefit in a big way from new lower corporate tax rates. What am I not seeing if anything? Thanks!"
"Sold awhile ago at $42. Have watched for reentry, but after today's earnings think I'll wait a little longer as this could fall well below $30 I believe."
Tried to buy at open at Friday close price. Was not meant to be today. I will let order hang out there for a while. Mainly a dividend play at 4.5% in a relatively safe stock
Losing all my earnings to PETS bears.... anyone plz offer me some comfort?
Unfortunately for PETS stock holders the FED's easy money penalizes conservative balance sheet like PETS and incentivises debt zombies like Petsmart & Chewy. You end up with margin pressure because those debt laiden companies should not be able to make debt payments with true hurdle rates. I suspect Petsmart and Chewy to go bankrupt but they will probably be brought back to life out of bankruptcy and continue be zombies for a long time. Hopefully PETS can continue to operate with sufficient margins.
I think i am more excited than ever to buy in with new staff. I think this is going to be a chewy even better in long term. Meanwhile going to average down and buy more of it and keep it for long. Enjoy the dividend as well. Holding from avg of $43. I think we going to 50s soon
why is PETS down 9%?
"We may be seeing a flight to quality, and MED is definite quality...Hard to find debt free, cash rich, profitable, growing, reliable dividend and buying back shares to boot...$MED, $PETS, $TROW, $GRMNhttps://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50407148-whodidntante/5529253-no-real-debt-plenty-of-cash-dividend-hike"
Really can't figure out why it hasn't touched $30 yet! Guess the analyst ratings is still holding it back quite a bit.
41% has shorted . Sqeeze is coming . I see 40 easy.
Buy the dip cause only good news to come. Will add more if opens red tomorrow but I think we are rebounding tomorrow
"Let's say you are a retiree that needs to supplement his social security with $20,000 of income. How much does it take?PETS stock $300,000S&P = $1.1 Million10 year treasury = just under $1 MillionAs long as PETS has pristine balance sheet and can pay the dividend that's going to be attraction for a lot of people."
I added more to this monster today but the volume is low... the company is great and pays well dividend. Stable company and i am staying long with this to $60-70
With stock float only 17.87 million could this go to 100+ on short covering? YES it hit 57 last week .
Read through the financial details of the year over year results. Looks like the more competitive environment was offset by lower tax rates. Let's say it's a no growth company earning $1.84. What would stock be worth if it had $20 per share of cash and no debt. Well it doesn't have $20 but it does have $5 per share and has the nice problem of generating more than can be successfully put back in to business.
"PETS really needs to revamp their website... expand beyond cats, dogs, and horses. If you look at sites like Chewy ... site is more pleasing and has many more offerings ... seems this space was is getting more competitive ... needs to evolve to keep competitive"
Dividend 4.8% vs 10 year at 1.8%. That's about fair value in my opinion. (3% spread). Probably going to wait it out and see if I can pick up at a discount.
Not sure if it the meme crowd or what that is responsible for the recent increase but in my view this is a $30 stock all day long. Wish I knew why they were showing Akdag the door so that may have something to do with the recent action but maybe not.
weekly close above $17.50 to get the momo crowd.....11m shares short are stubborn and wont be easy 100k avail to short 16.1% interest rate.....getting little pricey any news that they worked out some deals with distributors and its the spark needed.. They would then oust Akdag and he gets his parachute pay out....hes 58 and been there 14 years
"Never posted my predictions but I had a worst case earnings of $0.35/share, a likely $0.43/share and a high of $0.53/share. Hoping for a big beat - we'll see on Monday."
Buying opportunity. Revenue growth affirms strong underlying business. Excellent investment for long-term.
What are the chances of a beat and a dividend hike? Could be the catalyst for the next subtle short squeeze...
"O.K Ex dividend. I got mine. Looks like the selloff was today. Like the company, Im a buyer on dips."
Not quite sure where many of you guys are coming with the negativity. They missed analyst predictions by a cent. Repeat customers were up 11% if I recall and average sales up $3. Block the noise and show patience.
Buffett talks about the need to be sure of earnings. I can be pretty sure with PETS
Slept on DLTH. Going to use valuation metric of 10 × cash flow which works out to $8.43. That's about 5% below yesterday's close. Anyway hopefully that will save someone some due diligence time.

"All people did was buy pets during lockdowns. Prices for pure bred dogs skyrocketed, likely causing breeders to increase production. My guess is, I’m thinking this baby-boom of pets leass to increased pet product/med purchases. Either way, PE looks okay compared to what else is out there"
Got 2000 sold at $25.17 on the pop. 3000 left to hang on to in case this thing gets crazy. Hard to believe you could have bought all you wanted for $15.00 three months ago.
How bad was the earning?
Just read on bloomberg that value stocks at nearly 50 year low compared to growth stocks. Maybe we will get some of Amazon's and Teslas's PE.
Still amazed that the shorts pick on this one...https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50407148-whodidntante/5585694-pets-continues-to-intrigue
You can grab nearly a 4% yield today... Over 6 million shares short will have to pay that on Nov. 6...

"Anyone know why there is such a large short position here? No debt, good earnings, steady div payer- what gives? Not an investor yet, but considering a position soon."
This is just a spin off from what’s happened over at GME. Trading platforms like Robinhood and TD are turning off the ability to buy these heavily shorted stocks to protect their precious hedge fund buddies.
I like it based on current 10 year Treasury at $26.63 and below. Let's see if we get there by end of the year.
"Short interest on the rise again. +1.4m shares for the month of May. Amazes me that folks would short a reliably profitable and dividend paying company. Debt free and profitable during a pandemic, recession, and record unemployment! I can't accumulate fast enough..."
Doubled position just now. This will do just fine. People selling are giving them away just before earnings beat.
I put another sell in at $25.80 for a 1000 shares but wouldn't surprise me if the pop was high for the quarter as probably max fear trade by the shorts. You never know for sure what prices are going to do.
I’ve shorted plenty of equities in the past but holding an unprotected short position on this one would worry the heck out of me. There is something coming.....wait for it.
45 days to bye bye Ask-Daggy and then the stock can really moooooon!
Plug new 10 year treasury rate in I get stock value $22.61. Under valued 30%. One more down day and will probably buy more.
Top Bullish Charts | June 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"Read everything I could on Petsmart, Chewy and CHWY IPO. My understanding. Both rated CCC which means paying about 11% to borrow. Chewy losing around $300 million per year, hoping to raise 800 in IPO. Like I said earlier building 50 million dollar facility in NC. Guy running Chewy is former Amazon exec. Equity value of Chewy is negative 350 million. How is all of the above even possible except it's other people's money."
"Got a fill at .17, blue light special or buy low sell high! Thanks shorties."
Someone get this going on Reddit . Great company needs a major boost
I bought some shares early on and have always wanted to add more. I was hoping for a dip and it looks like I found one. I’ll be watching this closely and will add more when the selling pressure subsides. GL all! Build your own pet ETF! $WOOF $PETS $CHWY $STIC $PAWZ
Looks like they bought back same amount of stock as they paid out in dividend. That's $0.54 returned to shareholders. I think a good quarter with gross margins up. I am going to leave model the way it is since sales isn't growing and call my estimate at $22.43. Not sure what stock will do but probably a buyer in the 16's and seller in the 28's.
"Is it a coincidence that the existence of this flock of uniCONs grazing on Wall Street reflect fantastical financial engineering and a state of unreality that parallels the opioid epidemic. The only way to justify the valuation of a majority of these uniCONs is a bowl of 80 mg OxyContin scripts prescribed by your licensed pill pusher with full awareness of potential side affects including financial delusion. What happened to a preference for clean balance sheets, a healthy dosage of cash, net income, and dividends..."
The Investor Place article doesn’t get the business right. Pets often require on going medication and while I may buy from the vet at the time of visit I’m not reordering when I can buy cheaper online. Simple. Vets are the companies best marketing.
Best I can tell there have been only for days in the past month that you could have bought this stock with 7% yield ($15.43 or less). It didn't stay there long so unless the business really deteriorates that's probably a good buy price imo. I am going to save some cash to doubledown if we get to 8% before next earnings report.
Getting down to takeover target price levels!
"CFO just bought almost 10,000 shares at $31.20 !!!!!!!!That is my signal to get in !!!!Being a CFO myself, CFOs know the numbers."
what's the news?
"Not great earnings, even if you factor in one time expenses. Good news is they're holding dividend and have plenty of cash."
I think it's at least a $25 - $35 stock with treasury rates so low. Who knows maybe shorts get squeezed and it goes much higher.
Yahoo shows short interest of 63%. If that is anywhere near correct then we could see a price explosion on any positive news at all
does anyone know why PETS have been going down?
"I think the shorts are covering their positions now after their win with the sub par earnings report just released. I am going to start a small position. love that dividend and I actually use this company for my dogs medication. Remember what peter lynch used to say. "" Buy what you know"". The company has great customer service, some of the lowest prices. Much cheaper then buying from my vet. The only negative I see here is increased competition and having to discount more then they would like to maintain their market share. But that juicy dividend is like a sirens song to me right now, lol."
"Excellent way to beat earnings estimates, PETS. Revenue just met estimates, but the stock has been overly beaten down (like many smaller cap and mid caps). It is good to see a 30% rise in stock price."
"According to SEC fillings Morgan Stanley owns 5% or 1,033,860 as of January 02 2019"
"I first considered buying this stock in the $20's, again when it rose to the $30's and even thought about it in the $40's. Thought retracement to $30's might be a bargain, but never bought. Double-downed that thought in the $20's but trend never broke so I never bought. Now in the mid-teens and I have to admit I just can't figure this one out so I've yet to buy. Is this simply a broken stock or is something buried in the numbers that I'm just not finding. I understand growth is limited, less than 20% sales growth for the entire last decade, which is hard to fathom. I see most here are long terms bulls, but is the ever-growing competitive landscape just too much for the small PetMed Express?"

"Hi Joe, The CEO of Duluth resigned to go to UnderArmor. Stock is down, probably going to be a miss on guidance, but might be a chance to get a good price on bad news."
"Looks like the safest 6.34% dividend I've seen in a while. While everyone has been pining for growth, I'll take 6% while they cover it with earnings of 1.7x the payout (1.5x over the next 3 years) and have not had debt in the last 5+ years."
"Need a large retail partner to compete. Otherwise, Chewy is going to outlast them. Clean balance sheet, great platform...at current valuation, could be an easy add on for someone..."
The chart has the biggest sell signal on the chart which going to fall to $26.00 easy.
"Any price under $16 gives you a dividend spread to 10 year treasury right now of 5%. Probably a good risk reward. I would like to buy more at around $15, but not sure it will get there."
This happens from time to time. A bunch of value investors come across PETS and do a brief analysis involving price to sales and PE ratio and buy. If they looked further they would see Chewy's entrance into its market last year has forced them to lower prices by 10-15%. That is over half its profit margin in 2018. Now Walmart has entered the space too. PETS PE ratio is meaningless. They will have permanently much lower profits going forward. Last quarter's 33% decline is just a taste. It gets worse. For more look at this article. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4255782-petmed-express-win-situation
"Value of perpetual $1.08 dividend, 3% risk premium, Stock = $21.13. Reverse engineering it current stock price implies a $0.80 perpetual dividend. Based on on current dividend stock is at about 25% discount."
"Hi Joe, Thanks for heads up on MED. I have about a $900 - $1000 income each month for investing purposes. Placed my first order for MED 9 shares for $100. Little worried that wrong time for buying retail stocks but I plan to roll around a $1000 a month into MED if I can get for $100 or less. My type of company nearly no debt and asset light cash flow generator with dividend."
Should be a $100 stock. It is way undervalued. Just bought more and awaiting for $100 very soon. Make others aware too. Great buy
"Under Statistics, PETS is showing 40+% short at the end of 2020. I'm surprised there would be so much short interest on a relatively low PE stock with such a high dividend yield. Is PETS in a short squeeze like Game Stop?"
Walmart entered the Pet RX space today! https://www.walmartpetrx.com/Now PETS faces two much bigger competitors.
"Received a mailer for them over the weekend - They are really getting aggressive on the discounting. Hard to see how that forecast for Q2 earnings can be achieved. I like the prospects of this company, but think that they have more bad news coming up. Maybe I'll be wrong - hope that I am."
"The Pet Care sector:- All market caps are up an average of 55% in 5 months- PetCo is public again- Trupanion is no longer profitable- Zooplus more than halves its P/E- Chewy (-0.65 EPS) has surpassed IDEXX (6.71 EPS) in market cap- The one debt-free, profitable company (PetMed Express) in the bunch has the smallest market cap and pays a 3% dividendhttps://seekingalpha.com/user/50407148/instablogs#instablogs"
over reaction selloff. The numbers were great! watch amazon and microsoft give soft earnings and they will go to the moon.
Hey they made $5 Million bucks while Chewy was losing $30 million. Sounds pretty good to me.
"Takes some stone ones to short or sell this one in this market... 6.1 million shares losing money every day to margin interest, borrowing fees, and dividends... How stubborn do you have to be to intentionally lose money in this stock market?"
Way undervalued.. should be at $50. Added last week and will add if open red early morning on Monday. Nowhere to go but up

Can someone explain to me why this stock doesn’t trade like Chewy and the other stocks in the pet sector?
PETS is probably going to be the first $300 million dollar market company with no debt and $100 million cash. Seems impossible it could go to $200 million market cap. Why bother with the cost of being public?
"10 year treasury still dropping, at $16.20 dividend yield still 5.02% above treasury."
"From Bloomberg....sink your teeth into this.....I think author is spot on....""PetSmart is struggling with a pile of debt and we believe this IPO is simply a way to borrow funds from shareholders of Chewy to repay part of PetSmart’s debt whereas the shareholders will not get any control over the company in return. This begs the question of whether PetSmart will still have the best long-term intentions for Chewy."""
Short interest dropped another 1.2 million shares in the first half of February. I'm not sure the price reflects this... I always thought there was something peculiarly fishy w/ PETS short interest... but good to see them heading for the hills... I'd like to see this one trade on its true float w/out the millions of borrowed shares...
If you look at all the valuation metrics on statistics page I am pretty sure that all measures are by far the cheapest than they have been over last 10 years. The one that gets me is enterprise value / EBITDA =4.4. I like that measure because it includes cash and debt. I don't think I have ever ran across anything under 6 before and under 8 used to be my hurdle. Anyway I know earnings will come down but this stock is really cheap when overall market is really expensive.
"Been running scenarios on sp500. Using 4.4 nom gdp, 3% equity risk premium, dividend $56.08, 2.07 10 year sp500 = 1325How to make numbers work? Fed suppresses volatility of stock market so there is no risk premium orTen year fall to negative 1% orInflation of 25% orSome combination of the above. When you see the central banks doing weird stuff like a negative 0.4 ten year German bund or cutting rates at the top of the cycle you know the market numbers don't work anymore so they have to put their finger on the scale. If the SP500 fell to 666 a little over 10 years ago it can certainly fall to 1325 before Fed can stop the bleeding with more zero rates and qe. I did read that last time with the zero rate and we it was equal to a pretty heavy duty negative rate."
"CHEWY online sales are 1.96 BILLION!!!! thats why its over 100 a share....PETS needs to significantly up their game and become more like the AMZN model like Chewy.....they must figure out how to generate huge online revenue .....they currently are way behind the leaders....until that changes, this company will go no where...."
"A couple of thoughts. 1) Chewy. HQ only 30 miles or so from Pets. Read they have 50% of on-line pet supply market, so they are price setter. Current hiring on glass door I think was around 200. Saw a handful of pharmacy jobs in Az. Employee comments. Tough place to work because culture changing from startup to big company. Tougher to get stuff done.Shorts- Days to cover is I guess at record for this stock 15.2. Tried to find comparison data, but could not. I do know that is very, very. Going to nibble as price goes lower. I got to think there is some smart money that will make the shorts pay."
"Solid numbers for the qtr, now what is the plan to grow the company to take advance of the brand? PETS has the cash, add product lines, acquisitions, etc. Make it happen!"
"The bottom fishers did really well today. Troubling times live Covid make us connect to our pets more. The unconditional love does apply to pets, therefore more pet spending in these troubling times. Our pets become our sole companion. No wonder this stock rebounded so fiercely!!!"
CHWY just upgraded to buy by Jefferies with $100 price target. Finding it hard to see how PETS doesn't have a great earnings report at the end of the month unless CHWY is cutting into their customer base. I'm expecting an earnings beat from PETS.
PETS will be bought out.
"I'm glad it's picking up, and probably because of upcoming earnings. Would still be a long wait for me. Bought it back when it was on 20s. At least it comes with a pretty decent div. yield."
This is $12-13
for the past 5 days down every morning rebounding hard in afternoon... great sign of strength and large pop to come
"Short interest has been consistently irrational for years in PETS. So much so, that I fear a large percentage of it may be naked (permanent fails to deliver).But considering this is still a small cap, takeover/acquisition has to be a possibility (especially for a debt-free, profitable, cash rich company in a growing sector). If an investor takes a sizable position the short interest could exceed the float. Longs will be able to name their price (similar to the Porsche/Volkswagon take-over back in the day).I'm eager to see if anyone w/ this mentality is willing to invest and/or become CEO here..."
Well the stock is higher than pre- earnings! Not bad kiddies
"Earnings call and Dividend announcement, Monday May 3rd pre market. HMM do you really want to be short over the weekend? Sounds like they want it out loud for Monday trading."
Averaged down under $28. PETS is now my largest holding. This selloff (on very low volume) creates very attractive buy.
Breakout starting.
"Profitable, debt-free, 3.8% yield and future buyers to the tune of over 5 million shares... No other stock offers that potential...https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50407148-whodidntante/5520927-uniqueness-of-pets-short-interest"
"PETS has lowered prices again. Now in addition to 30% off, they are offering another $5 to $20 off for orders over $49. Lower prices mean lower margins. This quarter will be worse than the last."
"PETS is extremely shorted (around 30%). Right now all high shorted stocks are being bought up by the meme traders. So PETS gets to enjoy the rally as well. I can’t imagine if they do come out with some great news, it’ll only go even higher."
Going to do a second large buy on this at $20.35. That's going to be 20% of my portfolio. 3% in vanguard international. Remainder in vanguard short term treasury fund.
Certainly a nice day and with earnings Monday one wonders if earnings are going to be great. Hopefully we don't sell on the news.
"Enterprise Value / EBITDA = 5.64...Its dirt cheap, pricing in a lot of bad news"
"Anyone have any predictions on upcoming earnings? I am betting on a more positive report than last quarter. I think we will see stronger sales, just hoping earnings stay somewhat strong. I like the fact that PETS balance sheet is strong in this competitive space and think that may ultimately lead to a larger market share."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Love the premarket drop on great news. Same thing happened right after earnings last time and the stock eventually popped to above $40 about a week later.
With but a 17 million share float this stock could easily double in the next 12 to 18 months at present growth rate. Also makes a very attractive buyout candidate. A no brainer buy imo.
I could see $20 easily on valuation but would love to see $25.
"Oh, my, it is a long way back down to $15 per share (where PETS was in Aug 2019). But earnings are heading back down there, so the stock probably will be too. The price of this stock got ahead of the company's financials, and it may be worth a look once it gets back to the $15-$16 price range."
Checked PETS website. Changed promotion from 30% off to added cash off if purchase over $100. Seems like 30% markdowns are still in place so if I read it correctly 35% on orders over $100. Seems like a way to pull forward sells and increase average order size. Probably increasing order size offsets 5% discount due to not having additional packaging and shipping cost. I like that they are trying things to improve competiveness.
"PETSis not a meme stock! Heavily shorted yes. The shorts are playing a game that could prove deadly for them. Americans love their pets. This is a company that’s actually making money. It’s probably true that the company needs a change in management . Lousy website. Needs better marketing, etc. Although their products basically sell themselves. Not a meme!! Sorry!!!"
Sold 110 at $17.38..Next sell is 750 at $17.43. We will see if it goes through. That's all of the shares that I got at under $15.43. Rest I paid at least $17 for.
I completely overlooked the appointment of Jodi Watson to the board... back filling the Schweitzer vacancy? Impressive resume! Maybe this had more to do with the recent price spike than Akdag contract?
Added @ $31
Sold today. Thought they might come off with a small miss but this was a pretty big one. They held the dividend which should help support the stock but I think short pressure to drive the share price down will eventually win. I think they'll either have to try an acquisition or be bought out. Just my 2 cents. In my area I see nothing but Chewy boxes out at the curb on recycling day and Chewy commercials on TV.
"PETS Price Prediction for June 25, 2021: Open $35.21, High $36.25, Low $34.93, Close $35.95"
Read a couple of places that because of Fed policy since 2009 there are 13% of companies that shouldn't exist because operating income doesn't cover interest expense. That's probably the Petsmart/Chewy situation. Tesla too. It's a drag on the 87% of companies who are left who are having to compete with these so called zombies.
I’d like to get an honest opinion for PETS. What do you see for this company in the future? Would this be a good long term stock? What price do you forecast for 2025? I know it’s hypothetical but I’d like to gather opinions.
PETS made more money and raised the Dividend. This is such a good hold with multiple options for large upside. Dividend Expiration 5/14/21.
"PETS has a double bottom at 33.15 and 33.40 for past year. Needs to hold above that level. However, has broken both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Not good!"
"Im in for $800k at 28.85... I never saw a stock with such great risk reward.... $40 mil in net income, 568 mil valuation and $100 mil in cash... and wsb likes them... and and and their getting a new CEO"
My limit is in @ $27.50... looking forward to some nice volume to draw attention to this...
I bought in at 50.00. Seems like a good time to get in since it fell so much from premarket.
"Back to July prices and nothing but super good earnings since, plus a dividend increase. Guess the shorts must have piled in today. Sticking with my prediction of $70 in a year."
"Go back to screening: all companies in the S&P 600 (small), low debt, div yield above 2% (market): pets is top 25 companies of highest dividend. Btw, pets has zero debt! Stock is cheap, don’t be"
Thinking of buying 1k shares just to see how it will affect the shorts .
Here is another way to look at it. Let's say PETS stock trades at $15.43 for a year and earnings are poor at $1.08 Just enough to pay the dividend which would be 7%. Let's assume PETS earns 2% on their cash holdings. If they use cash to buy in stock they can swap $2 for $7 until excess cash is used up. I suspect excess cash was on the books for just this purpose which is to provide extra earnings during lean years.
In 5 days this will soar
Why is that investors often want their successful company to be bought by a competitor? I want PETS to remain independent and continue to grow and raise their dividend.
Chewy's up 6% today. Don't see any reason why PETS shouldn't have a great quarter but there's not a lot of optimism reflected in the share price.
"Why the drop steep drop in price, what am I missing on the earnings report here?"
"23% short, why so many shorting a profitable coming that pays a dividend???"
"PETS CEO said there is $29 million in the coffer for stock buyback. They could reduce their outstanding shares and increase EPS by 10%. The volatility in the past week could be buying opportunity for the company.I like PETS at this level because it's make money, has no debt, pays a good dividend. Chewy is losing $$$, not sure about debt level, but it's just too speculative."
This co is the cheapest in the pet space. Could be a buy out candidate.

Keep rolling! Bought at 13.00.
Loving all the new buying opportunity today. Grabbed some more
This stock is a weird one ... I still think this would be an ideal company for one on the big cap companies to #$%$ Cash .. no debt... good customer base... low market cap. Wouldn?t take a lot of money for someone. If they remain solo they have to improve growth through some more creative things. Good company ... good money maker .... competitive edge needs to improve. They should start by improving their website. Looks like something from the 90s
so I'm new to stocks the only reason I bought this stock was because something went wrong with earnings i got in at 34 and was hoping it would go back to 40 was this a mistake ?.... a little wisdom would be much appreciated
I like using guru focus free site. If you look at PETS data it looks like a quality investment. If you look back at dividend yield history there have only been 3 time periods that dividend got above 5.5%. Looking back those would have been good entry points for long term investor. Not sure if it will get there again anytime soon but 5.5% dividend would be $19.63.
I had 500 shares at 31.10 average. Just sold at 400 of them at $49.90. This could go to 100+ but I'm taking a nice profit. Holding a small position to see what happens. GOOD LUCK LONGS!!
"If you make the assumption that PETS is going to be a non growing dividend payer going forward then the way I look at it is you compare it to a 10 year treasury and add a risk premium because it's not as safe as a treasury. If it's only one stock of many in your portfolio then the historical risk premium to use is 3%. If it pays out all earnings except what is needed to keep dividend steady then it simply becomes fair value is when yield is 3% more than treasuries or today 1.45% + 3% or when yield on PETS is 4.45% or stock is at $24 at today's treasury rate.I am trying make the point that if you think business is sound enough that dividend will continue to be paid it can be as simple as adding 3% to 10 year treasury yield. If you want to be more conservative you can use 4 or even 5% spread. Current spread is 5.5%.We are in low interest rate world. Vanguard utility fund pays only 2.8% and their REIT fund pays 3.8%. They don't have single stock risk but they do have risk because utilities and twits use leverage.Our biggest challenge is knowing what the future of PETS business model is. I have decided to not guess and just use what the analyst estimates are. Right now I am saying dividend is sound because of excessive cash on books and earnings estimates are a little over $1.00 this year and next.I could be wrong in my thinking, but with value style investing you try to estimate future cash flows and compare to risk free return and decide if you are confident enough to pull the trigger. Good luck to all traders and investors in a world dominated by Fed and Trumpster."
"Currently using a dividend discount model assuming dividend growth of 4%, equity risk premium of 3% and 10 year treasury of 2.55% and I get a stock price value of around $23. Of course assumptions make for different stock value."
What gives with the short interest. Seems high.
"A good earnings report will certainly send this up, ex dividend also. Todays drop seems false."
I've looked at other online pet pharmacies and they all seem to be offering discounts. Looks like a tough market and eventually seomone's going to come out on top. PETS seems to be holding its own for now.
Wow short interest is very high on this one ... over 5 million shares with 22 million shares outstanding
Having an uncovered short on ex/dividend day on a high yield stock like PETS never made sense to me since the lending broker is still entitled to dividends that the issuer pays on the shares that were lent. Making payments in lieu of dividends to the brokerage to reimburse it for the dividends that it would have otherwise received would be one more reason why i'm struggling to figure out this huge short position as it apparently that doesn't seem to matter. Perhaps they believe the likelihood of a sale of PETS is unlikely as there are little to no barriers to entry to this business and thus little risk of a big run up and squeeze.
what is going on? I've watched this rise from 8% to 13% in the past 5 minutes...
"Here is another conundrum. On average last year Chewy lost around $7.50 on every $100 order. PETS made about $13.30 on ever $100 order. How can you reason that Chewy is worth 4 times sales and pets is worth 1 times sales. Yes this year pets numbers will not be as good, but will be a loss."
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now .

Looks like a buyout or whale making a big position. A short squeeze is possible but this stock carries a high dividend and is costly to carry short.
"Hi, how or where do you find that information on the number of shares available to short? I am aware of sites that show the overall number of shares shorted but I don't understand when you say ""available to short"". Thanks for any help/guidance."
"Major financial news letter editors are advising their subscribers to buy $Pets, which is a very strong stock. Let the short squeeze begin."
PETS is the only stock of a debt-free profitable company with a dividend yield over 1% and short interest above 5%... and that short interest is 37% of float...
40k available to short. 10.6% borrow rate. Get ready ......getting interesting
It looks like PETS is ready to make move to $36 today!
