I like the company but it does seem rich. My discipline has me selling at these levels. best of luck
Another stellar quarter delivered by TSCO... TSCO continues to be a favorite holding of mine and one I hope to hold for the next decade or two. Good luck TSCO longs!
TSCO reached an all time high at 216.44
"Great time to buy more. Gifts like this do not happen often. Great top and bottom line beat, good forecast. What's not to like?"
6-7% revenue growth expected for CY18.
Warren Buffett once said buy what you know buy what you like That's how I feel about this company I only wish I had bought more shares earlier
Is this the week?
tsco is a sell at $80. Rising dividend makes it a solid long term hold as well. Their products are defensive against internet retailers because of shipping costs.
"People are starting to realize this is one of the few retailers with excellent growth prospects, industry leading profitability metrics and a rock solid balance sheet. I own my shares from the low $50's and have no plans to sell anytime soon. Very well positioned for the next decade plus in my opinion. Let the story play out and enjoy."
"Couldn't care less how the stock trades post-earnings release today. Based on pre-market, there could be some dampening of expectations going forward, but the long term story remains in tact in my opinion. TSCO is the only player in their space without competition is some areas. I own my shares in the low-$50's and plan on holding for many years to come. Good luck TSCO longs!"
time for a split!
Read my post two days ago I said going up to $82 this week.
"It's been a great ride folks, but there's still plenty of upside remaining, although it will likely slow down soon. TSCO's profitability metrics are best in class in retail with ROE = 30%, ROA = 16% and ROIC = 24%. There's still growth ahead and TSCO is better positioned against AMZN than most retailers. Add in my personal prediction that TSCO could easily be acquired by LOW or HD at some point and it's a beautiful story, even from these levels. Best of luck TSCO longs."
"Interesting article on seeking alpha. Writer sees a 13,4% annual return for the next 5 years. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4314112-tractor-supplys-secret-sauce-is-to-go-where-retailers-dont"
The conference must be giving them a chance to tell their story. We are an upgrade away from a spike.
I have 900 shares and plan to buy more on this pullback.
A bit over 3 weeks since the last earnings and as of today TSCO is up about 12% from the post-earnings low. Seems the be the same story quarter after quarter. Good luck TSCO longs!
"I posted a link to a YouTube video, but it is gone? That not allowed? Was about TSCO :-)"
Fantastic earnings
"Well... China is about to respond to our tariffs with tariffs of their own on our outgoing agriculture (soybeans in particular to get hurt). This will harm our farmers and the domino effect will likely hurt one of their primary retailer/suppliers as well, that being TSCO. It's unfortunate, but not unexpected."
One of the best companies. Growing at over 30%?! A solid addition to any portfolio
TSCO 50 day SMA crossed over 200 day SMA and we are now seeing the effects of the 'golden cross' scenario. Bullish momentum breakout here we come! Looking forward to $70!
Today Merrell report says TSCO sales are record setting. $204 price target. Probably blows by that on July19 report.
Great buy today at $172.00
Does the market like this acquisition? Stock up nicely! I bought in at 146 back in August
Broke the 200 day look out above
"Well, I guess we won’t see a 2:1 split anymore."
"What is happening to, TSCO? Does someone know something that we don't?Seems that it should be bought and not sold. I expect this company to be acquired by someone like Amazon, or FDX, or UPS."
Got in in the mid 50's. What does everyone think? Is now the time to take profits and run?
"From today's earnings report:In their revised guidance for fiscal 2021, both lower numbers of the new guidance ranges for EPS and Revenue were above the high numbers for the same ranges under the previous guidance given.EPS moved from a range of $6.50 to $6.90 per share to $7.05 to $7.40 per shareRevenue moved from a range of $10.7 to $11.0 billion to $11.4 to $11.7 billionYowsa..."
"A 14% drop for the week is painful any way you look at it. While I had no intentions of selling anytime soon, it's still no fun to see a holding give up so much in a short period (especially when most everything else joined the party the past couple days). My position was made just last summer, so my average cost is in the mid-$50's. I like TSCO's business, their management, it's growth prospects, but love their profitability metrics. If this drops another 10% or so, I'll happily start adding to my position again. I always do increments, as one can never tell what might happen to the market overall. I hope this week didn't hurt any of the TSCO longs too bad. Good luck to you!"
analysts don't need to labor over this stock. just face fact that this is a consistent solid company that just continues to deliver.
"I shop at ts three times a week and it is always packed ..the growth rate of new store openings has been on a tear. I live in the heart of ag production so it may be different elsewhere. I am adding on any,dip myself .."
"In over 15 years of trading TSCO, I have learned one valuable lesson the hard way: NEVER BET AGAINST TSCO!"
Split damit
Lot's of competition. Think I'll sit today out and see where this settles. No hurry to jump in.
TSCO is up 4.93% to 62.96
"Don't look now, but TSCO now up about 15% from last quarter's earnings report, which is also a new all-time high. The runway for growth is still a long one in my opinion."
Will break $100 by mid next week based on my analytics. I still think a stock split for TSCO is LONG overdue to fuel market base expansion. Buying on the dips.
TSCO just keeps going and going…
solid stock.
Bought some more along with CVS. Two strong companies that are built to last especially in these conditions for the next few years or so.
Earnings were good !! Why the pre market drop ????
the best stocki have ever owned period
Was in this name years ago and had a lot of bad luck...today I just rotated back in. I've done my homework and I think $200 a share is quite possible. Glad to be a part of the club again and looking forward to making money this time.
In this pace we will see a new 52 week high this month!
"I don't focus on short term swings, but TSCO is up over 5% from the lows yesterday. Two ways to look at this... 1) Solidifies long term view to hold. 2) Chance for those turning bearish to exit. I'm admittedly in the #1 bucket, but would love to hear from those who sold recently or are looking to sell."

And away we go.....
RBC Capital raised price target to $175 from $168 and maintained their Outperform rating...
I am thinking future growth. Looks like earnings projections for 2019 are somewhat flat even though they add 80 stores. Many companies are projecting very conservative future earnings figures due to basic fear of the economy. For me it is unfounded.
$200 by Aug. 1
"I have never seen such BS manipulation on stocks as recently. TSCO, FDX etc...these should all be 50 pts higher.Such blatant manipulation."
"Long time consumer and investor of TSCO. An observation of changes to the rewards program. They have changed this program again. It really ""tries"" to reward big buyer and really hits small buyers. That reward system to me was what made TSCO better than AMZN by a little, better than my local hardware by a little, better than HD or LOW for some things. Without the reward, I have no incentive to try to shop at TSCO to get the reward and make big purchases quarterly. I am strongly considering shifting my loyalty as a consumer. What really #$%$ me off is the April 1 reward is gone with the change. I had earned it, told I would get it and counted on it. I am buying what I planned to buy at other places."
"Several analysts raised the price target on Tractor Supply Co (NASDAQ:TSCO) following its Q3 results.Citi analyst Steven Zaccone raised the price target to $220 from $185 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares.Credit Suisse analyst Lavesh Hemnani maintained Tractor Supply with a Neutral and raised the price target from $190 to $215, suggesting a 2% upside.Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman maintained Tractor Supply with an Equal-Weight and increased the price target from $200 to $215.Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba lifted the price target on Tractor Supply from $200 to $215.DA Davidson analyst Michael Baker raised the price target on Tractor Supply to $216 from $190.Baird analyst Peter Benedict hiked the price target to $230 from $210, keeping an Outperform rating on the shares.Piper Sandler analyst Peter Keith raised the price target to $250 from $219 and reiterated an Overweight rating on the shares following the ""strong"" Q3 results.Raymond James analyst Bobby Griffin maintained Tractor Supply with a Strong Buy and increased the price target from $215 to $245, implying a 16% upside.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman maintained Tractor Supply with an Outperform rating and increased the price target from $215 to $230, suggesting a 9% upside.Benziga"
"Not a fan of LOW, AMZN, or anyone else buying out TSCO. They are doing just fine as a stand-alone company."
Due for a split! All 4 previous splits were August or September and price has never been this high.
TSCO reached a new 52 Week High at 79.04
"A couple equity analysts downgraded TSCO, but I think the market overreacted today. One analyst downgraded to 'market perform' with a price target of $83, which isn't the end of the world. The other downgraded from 'strong buy' to just a 'buy', which makes a lot of sense after the big run. Stocks shouldn't go up in a perfectly straight line, so I'm fine with this and doesn't change my outlook. Good luck TSCO longs."
Tractor supply is a great company ! Great customer service and easy to shop at stores.
Wedbush maintains Neutral rating but adjusts price target from $145 to $180Dow Jones
Seriously?
"New all-time high following TSCO's acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home and their 165 stores. Brilliant acquisition! The Orscheln stores will benefit from TSCO's efficient distribution network and marketing campaigns. Should add to earnings immediately. Adding over 8% to store base for under $300 Million. I'll say it again, brilliant acquisition!!"
"Question? Do you buy and hold indefinitely or do you sell at some point and take a profit with TSCO? I have owned TSCO for several years I first bought at $61.79 then again at $68.19 in 2013 and 2014, then bought again for $75 and $76 in 2016 and 2017 and have held them ever since."
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/24/business/tractor-supply-company-retail/index.html
"I've said this before, but TSCO one of the few retailers who are well positioned for both today and tomorrow. Their balance sheet and profitability metrics are in the best in class category for retail. As an example, ROA @~16% and ROE @~30% are great indicators of management's effectiveness in running the business. Long term debt is easily covered with one year's free cash flow. TSCO is less impacted by e-commerce than most retailers, but is still building a decent e-commerce operation of its own. I only started my position early this past summer in the mid-$50's, but hope to hold this for years to come. I have a full position now, but if I didn't would likely still be adding at these levels. Best of luck TSCO longs."
Benchmark hops onto the Tractor with a Buy and a price target of $219…
Money printing
I sure wish I had bought more a few months back :-(God Bless AmericaTrap
"When TSCO goes woke with new ""equity"" initiatives, I know it's time to sell.Sell it all."
"TSCO hasn't been affected at all by supply chain disruptions or customer traffic. It's business model is more resilient than Walmart and it is one of the most profitable companies in America with 6x earnings growth and $800million in fcf, it should dominate retail over the coming decade!"
I continue to believe that TSCO's pet food initiatives are going to drive future growth. I'm a buyer in the low 60's.
Earnings in a few days... get ready for good numbers and a drop in stockprice. I think we'll see the $180's again before the next move up. Dont get scared ;-)
Fantastic guidance…
"I'll repeat what I say just about every 3rd month... 'Another stellar quarter delivered by Tractor Supply... TSCO continues to be a favorite holding of mine and one I hope to hold for the next decade or two.'What happened today then? TSCO's valuation is at a level that's right historically. The higher the valuation, the more volatility we're going to see. Does the current growth trajectory warrant the current valuation? I'd suggest yes, but I also know this level of growth can't continue forever. I consider TSCO a near forever hold, so I'll continue focusing on where I expect the share price is headed 5, 10, 20 years from now. Stick with it true TSCO longs!"

"What am I missing, why the steap drop?"
tractor running on all cylinders. optimal performance
"Very interesting price action following earnings this morning. Earnings either missed slightly or were inline depending on how you look at it, with go-forward guidance being reiterated. That's been good enough for a 6%+ increase to start the trading day. That goes to show expectations were low, which is actually a good thing in this environment. My opinion only..."
This has been a solid performer for a long time.
is today ex div? I thought Tuesday. Says Div paid to those on record at close on 20th. that's Monday. ticker suggests .27 cents taken out today?

What is wrong with this world? The Rural King in our town is always full of customer vehicles. Maybe a handful at the tiny Tractor Supply across the road. The stock market is full of It.
Discretionary spending is rocketing higher. Brick and mortar like TSCO will see huge gains.
"Tough day today, but thank you TSCO for a well done quarter! TSCO is one of only 6 or 7 retailers I see as truly investable for the long term. Look at profitability metrics (ROA, ROE and especially ROIC) and compare to other retailers. TSCO is near best in class. I'm long shares from mid-$50's and have no plans to sell anytime soon. There's still growth in their future and I still believe the potential for TSCO to be acquired at some point as well. Good luck TSCO longs!"
What’s wrong with today’s investors? Couldn’t as for a better report. Makes it hard to figure what to invest in when someone performing this well goes down for no reason.
"'Fair Value' is primarily based on objective measures, but is really subjective as a while. I've adjusted mine for TSCO a bit and it now sits right around $90. TSCO should get a huge financial benefit with reduced tax rates beginning this year. I don't expect a lot of revenue growth this year, which is a negative. However, their typical 35% rate will be reduced to the low 20's, which should substantially increase earnings, free cash flow and profitability metrics (ROA, ROE & ROIC) which were already near the best in retail. My average cost is mid-$50's, but no current plans to sell. Assuming market conditions stay the same, I might start trimming just a bit if/when it's up around $100 per share. I like the niche TSCO dominates in retail and as I've said before, think there's a real possibility of HD or LOW trying to acquire TSCO at some point. Lots of synergies and would be immediately accretive to earnings for both, while providing a nice growth engine in their mostly saturated U.S. market. Good luck fellow TSCO longs..."
Short term pull back today. Picking up more shares if the pullback extends to 10%
"We're about a single negative retail report away from TSCO dropping below $60, which while ridiculous, I'm actually hoping will happen. Why? Selfishness... I want more shares and sub-$60 is the price I'm willing to add shares. TSCO's valuation is below much of retail, while having a superior balance sheet, delivers higher free cash flow yield, has best in class profitability metrics and serves a niche customer that insulates them to some degree from Amazon and others. This deserves to trade a premium to it's retail counterparts, not a discount. As an added kicker, I still believe there's a real possibility that HD and/or LOW makes a move to acquire TSCO at some point. My guess is LOW, but makes good sense for either in my opinion.Good luck TSCO longs. Don't get discouraged and think long term."
New high
glad I added this to my portfolio weeks ago. solid performance
so far another good day for TSCO. this stock has been very good to me. GLGod Bless AmericaTrap
Wells Fargo maintains Overweight - move price target to $200 from $180...
"Weaker than expected guidance is going to make this an ugly day and quite possibly an ugly trend going forward, at least for a while. Doesn't change my long term opinion on the company and the stock though. Continue to believe TSCO is uniquely positioned to succeed with its core Tractor Supply stores long term though (not a fan of the PetSense stores tho'). Plenty of room for store growth and further operational efficiencies (especially distribution) as well. Definitely not selling my shares and would like to add at the right price. Good luck TSCO longs!"
Anyone find any news today that would attribute to this being down 4%? All I'm finding are store openings and approval for new stores.

"Is TSCO not doing well during the Xmas season? The stock has underperformed the market over the last month. Anyone been to the stores lately, what have you seen?"
"Wondering if Tractor Supply will integrate some of Orscheln's product line in with theirs. Farm and Home sells ammo, fishing and hunting supplies. I think that would benefit Tractor Supply bottom line and bring in more customers. Just a thought!"
"I'll repeat what I say just about every 3rd month... 'Another stellar quarter delivered by Tractor Supply... TSCO continues to be a favorite holding of mine and one I hope to hold for the next decade or two. Good luck TSCO longs!'BTW... TSCO's valuation is by no means cheap at this point. The higher the valuation, the more volatility we're going to see. I choose to ignore short term noise and focus on where I see the share price 5, 10 even twenty years from now. Assuming Tractor Supply sticks to the game plan they've employed for the past 20+ years, there's still many multi-bagger returns to come in my opinion."
"15% dividend increase, nice! Staying long!"
"TSCO delivers another stellar quarter. I've said it before, but I'll say it again... Tractor Supply is one of the few retailers that still has great prospects for growth and they're doing it while delivering profitability metrics that are industry leading. Balance sheet is rock solid with minimal debt giving TSCO great flexibility to better deal during the next recession (whenever that may be). I own my shares from the low $50's and continue to feel the growth story is in tact. I trimmed about 20%, realizing some profits, but plan to let the rest run, hopefully for many years to come. Good luck TSCO longs!"
"Just my take: Markets will continue a downward slide for at least another 30 days and keep dragging TSCO down with it. Still too many unknowns out there. It will recover eventually, but not short term."
"Spring is just around the corner. Farmers will be buying new equipment. Sales will increase, hence earnings as well."

"TSCO's all time high was right around $96 per share about 20 months ago. I see few reasons we cannot get back there in fairly short order. TSCO will realize a huge benefit with the new corporate tax rate this year. What can they do with this new found cash?- Increase share buy back, benefiting existing shareholders (share count decreased 18% over past 10 years).- Increase quarterly dividend, benefiting shareholders - Quickly pay off remaining long term debt, which is minimal- Speed up growth plan- Build up a bit of a war chest, as a safety net for future recessions which is a matter of when, not if.My guess is it'll be a combination of all. Good luck TSCO longs..."
Nice movement !!
Goldman Sachs maintains Buy rating and raises price target from $170 to $188...
Made new estimates and calculations over the weekend. Now I am buying below $70 selling above $100. Price target $106. What do you think?
Upgrade right now would be great.
We are so close to breakout territory! 50 day SMA and 200 day SMA are now separated by the smallest of gaps! Go look for yourself and see. Tomorrow (i.e. Friday) is shaping up to be the 'perfect storm' given the momentum we are seeing today across the market. Golden cross scenario will likely result in a new floor at $65 as we work our way to $70! GL to longs!
"I'm loving my TSCO as a business but I have to admit the stock price is getting ahead of itself. I don't think they deserve a 30 pe this late in their business cycle. That said, im not selling. Definitely not buying either. Any thoughts?"
tractor up big tomorrow. see news release
Went long today. I’ve been in this before in low 50s and made a profit gonna hold this til high 70s
"If you're a trader, it's looking like it may go down back to the upper 60s again. Long-term, hold and buy more on weakness. Amazon-proof. Having said that, I saw a somewhat convincing technical article making the case for $100."
CRAMER recommended this a month ago. So I researched and bought at $85. staying long as I feel it has a lot of potential
Anyone read the earningsreport yet? Looking af the stockprice I think it was good :-)
"Low $90's was reached a couple years ago and I still believe that's about where current fair value should fall. Will it get there in the near term? I have no idea. Holding my shares from mid-$50's and happy doing so. I still believe there are catalysts ahead for TSCO, so no plans to sell at this point. Hopefully a hold for many years to come, but the market might have something to say about that. Good luck TSCO longs..."
Typical consistent quarter from TSCO... Love it! The stock got a bit ahead of itself and is now basing to grow back into its' valuation. The long term story is strong and remains in tact in my opinion. Holding my low $50 cost basis position and expect to for at least the next 10+ years. Unconcerned what the share price does near term. I'm confident in the company and won't let sentiment swings bump me out this position. Good luck TSCO longs!

"Home Depot is acquiring HD Supply... It's not unusual to see competitors follow acquisitions with a buy of their own. With that in mind, I wouldn't be surprised to see Lowes attempt an acquisition of Tractor Supply. There would be plenty of synergies while offering Lowes an entirely new avenue for growth. I prefer a standalone TSCO, but as a long term shareholder of both LOW & TSCO, it wouldn't be the worst thing in my opinion. Good luck TSCO longs!"

"$150.35 at 21OCT close to $137.13 at 22OCT open!!. No pundit analyses attempt to explain this except possibly for https://finance.yahoo.com/news/return-capital-employed-overview-tractor-134758935.html, which says “Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, Tractor Supply posted an ROCE of 0.13%.”But see also https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roce.asp, which says “In general, both the ROIC and ROCE should be higher than a company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in order for the company to be profitable over the long-term.”…and https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/NAS:TSCO/WACC-/Tractor-Supply, which says “As of today (2020-10-23), Tractor Supply Co's weighted average cost of capital is 6.23%. Tractor Supply Co's ROIC % is 16.26% (calculated using TTM income statement data). Tractor Supply Co generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.”.....so WHY??!!"
"hunterMy thought of TSCO is, it can be a takeover candidate. The reason I say that is,it is a company that is in the rural areas of America and growing. It has the potential to be a receiving center for Amazon, FDX, and or UPS. I also read last Sept sometime, that what TSCO sells, Amazon does not, so TSCO is safe there with their products. I can see where the companies that I mentioned deliver their orders to the designated store and the customer of the order picks their purchases up at the local TSCO store and may get some type of a credit to their account for doing so.Plus, when they pick up their purchases they will probably shop at TSCO, being that theyare a customer like myself. The store that I visit has plenty of property for receiving and parking as does another store, so there's plenty of room for storage and receiving and delivering."
