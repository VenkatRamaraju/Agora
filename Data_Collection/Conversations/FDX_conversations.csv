was thinking about buying some into the closing drop but now glad I didn't...
"Bullish reversals coming, delivery season is upon us!!!"
Listened to conference call last night. Company plans to buy back a billon dollars of stock. Why companies do this is to make it easier to beat EPS. If a company buys back shares and the stock falls lower than where shares were purchased like GE did for decades. All you end up doing is destroying cash position and balance sheet. This will get way oversold and be a great time to nibble. Remember it was already down over 20% before todays action. FDX will get this behind them within 12 months.
"Labor shortage. Lol. All these companies have to do is dip into their bottom line and pay people more money. Yea, it's gonna cost them, but look at the hit earnings anyway!These companies have enjoyed a one-way labor market for too long. I'm glad people aren't putting up with it anymore. The take it or leave it attitude has ran its course. They basically want to pay you pre-inflation wages in a post-inflation market. In effect a pay CUT. Gimmie a break!Stay strong people and don't work for peanuts."
"The RSI on this stock is around 15. Yes, it can still go lower, but that'd be pretty crazy."
52 week low. Time to add or start a new position.
Berenger Bank comes out with $330 PT this morning.
"The Bears are right about FDX. . . if you are a TRADER; Bulls are right, if you are an INVESTOR. YTD return is 2.43%. 8 mos is a long time with no real return. But . . . ""the longer the base, the higher in space"". P/E is down to 13.66. UPS' P/E is still at 28.39. RSI teetering on Oversold status at 36.18. 21 Analysts PT $353 & 32.75% upside and 17 buys, 3 holds & 1 sell. UPS' upside just 9.81% with 8 buys & 8 holds and 1 sell.FDX Great 4Q: Rev up 30% to $22.6B; $7B in cash and L-T debt $20B; in Q4 CF 15xInt Expense. Great FYE 5/31/21: Get this, Rev and CF in YE 5/31/2020 was $69.2B & $5.1B then shot up in YE 5/31/2021 to $83.9B & $10.1B!!!! After a great year, UPS' failings resulted in a big drop in FDX's share price. FDX's ransomware and their thin margins & high CapEx are behind them.Catalyst for big pop could be as FOMO, runup to 1Q ER, actual release 9/21, or ?!?!? A Bull run is coming soon."
They brought blue chip stock like FDX down to its kneesTrading at forward 10 PEImagine that in today's bloated market market
"Hold your shares, guys! Don't worry too much about the price today, tiny volume!"
"low risks, huge upside. i have 70% my account on this stonk."
"market overreacting, this is a 22bil bounce back $300"
The one good thing about owning FDX as a transport it’s a canary in the coal mine for a larger decline in big indexes - e.g S&P. Kind of a early warning signal to rotate to safer investments like cash.
"Cowen analyst Helane Becker also rates shares Buy. Like Ossenbeck, she wants FedEx management to address the labor situation going into the seasonally busiest time of the year. Becker points out FedEx will be adding about 50,000 workers to meet peak demand."
It's no wonder this companies stock is dropping hard. They can't even deliver packages!
"Labor costs are the problem, however, the miss is already in the price. This is already down over 24% so this price will not stick. We will be back over $300 by EOY"
Analysts exist to create buying opportunities for investors & institutions. An earnings miss for a very profitable company is not something I'm losing sleep about. I will add to my holdings & lower my total cost of all shares for FedEx. I'm in it for the long haul!
just purchased $100K in 215-220 CALL contracts between now and november
The time to buy is when everyone hates the stock which is now.
come on people. this stock is on sale. last quarter they told you a great story. things dont change that quickly. stocks going higher Wednesday and thru year end. Jan 250 calls easy money
"It might take some time, but FDX share price will come back. I just became a long term holder."
They had some interesting insights about FDX on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
And I was thinking I got a deal at 275 a few months ago. But still buying more today.
USPS introducing new first class service standards today - adding 2 days to the service. That means USPS has started to decrease use of fdx to bulk carry between long distance points. Fdx revenue decreasing while those fixes cost bite the bottom line…
"I’m so glad I shorted this dog before the bell! Easy money here, short it and make money."
I say we close at $219 and change today....end of month/quarter.
Where else can you find a solid company with a P/E of 11. Now compare that to where UPS is trading and you will see the value here.
"$FDX hit is 52WKLOW today!? revenue rose to 14% to $22 billion!! It's being treated as if revenues crashed! ABSOLUTELY NO WAY it stays this low for long. A MASSIVE DARK POOL BUY worth $53 million hit today. It's free money at $229 folks WATCH IT move at LEAST $10 by next Friday. Set it and forget it.$BIIB yesterday I told traders about the $48 million dark pool BUY, today it was 17 cents from breaking $300. $BIIB could be at $330+ by next Friday. HUGE NEWS BY FDA went unnoticed but it was MAJOR because it dispelled the NUMBER ONE BASH of $BIIB haters. FDA has officially added ""Reduction in amyloid beta plaques"" to its table of surrogate endpoints! Soooo WHY isnt $BIIB trading at $400+ today since the opposite sentiment that FDA shouldn't have approved it b/c it doesn't work crashed it? All the $BIIB should be handing under a rock right about now. THE GAME HAS CHANGED. BULLISH"
"Looks like FDX already bottomed and is finally headed higher. Volumes are getting stronger. Incredibly cheap stock if the management team properly uses the pricing lever, and continues to invest heavily in automation. However, when you appoint a Marketing guy to be your CEO and COO, who doesn't have any operational or financial management experience, there is a lot of risk that top line revenue growth trumps operational and cost control discipline. That may work for many of the tech stocks, but doesn't work for stodgy old companies like FDX and UPS."
"Nice, who let me buy the $215 call options this morning for $5 to $5.4 and then let me sell for $7.3 to $7.9. They are higher now, but a profit is a profit. Was also buying stock during the dip and will hold. going to the beach, have fun"
"FDX stock and market overall is going down. Dems about to announce their higher taxes to pay for all of their new marxist social welfare spending. They are going to increase corporate income tax rate, capital gains tax rate, individual income tax rate (includes small businesses who are the biggest employers in the country), estate taxes, taxes on stock buybacks, etc etc etc. Biden recently increased food stamp payments (SNAP program) by 25%, the largest increase in the history of the program! Dems also increased the monthly payment for each child you have from $200 to $300. Dems also didn't want to allow any property owner to be able to evict people who failed to pay their rent. They are also proposing that healthcare is free for everyone, as well as college. Biden also relaxed border controls and their are tens of thousands of people who have crossed the border this year, which we all know they take the jobs of our poor Americans as well as depress American wages and benefits. Their kids also end up in our public schools diluting scarce educational resources and increasing classroom sizes. They also end up in our hospital emergency rooms diluting and consuming scarce healthcare resources. Naturally, the fascists at Yahoo will delete this message."
"Ok, I’ll buy some here."
20 years of cheap labor is catching up with them .
"And here comes the 4 point drop, we had so much fun yesterday might as well reset and do it all over again tomorrow lol"
October will be a continuing of sept for inflation and rising fuel cost! 199 here we come!
£245 by friday 
And they just keep playing. Gap up is gonna hurt a lot of shorts.
"I’m sorry but who in their right mind bought this at $300+? Don’t think the pandemic shipping will last forever. FDX will do great, but folks who paid top money for the stock will need to wait loooong time to get to break even."
Got 30 more today at 220.36 100 total shares now 200 more to go.
"Big sell off at end of the day and still held a nice gain, volume up, looking good!"
This is currently a BUY
"Got 500 shares this morning, good luck to all"
Lets see an UP $6 ++ today.
This chart looks a lot like our dictators approval rating. This chart is a referendum on jobs. Wake up Socialists
I heard about FDX the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Hopefully this train keeps on rollin’ again tomorrow
UPS 26.81 PE ratio. FedEx 11.88.
"Lost 27% value in past 3 months, RSI is less than 15, (Lowest by far in SP500), PE less than 13. Has a Strong Buy rating from a number of analysts, Target Price over $340.00... Bla bla... Bleads without fail every day..... new 12 month lows.... Getting ready tp pucker-up and go for a ride! But... how low can FDX go??"
in april i thought i missed out not buy back in 270... and it went up to $300. I'm glad i didnt chase..Hopefully this can drop down to $160
"Will FDX and UPS have a hard time finding part time seasonal workers? Welfare for each child you have was increased by 50% to $3,600 per year, and food stamp payments (SNAP program) were increased by 25% to nearly $2,000 per year for each person. For a family of 4 that equates to roughly $15,000 a year. Add on the extra $2,000 per adult stimulus checks, and $10,000 per person as result of the extra $300 per week that the Dems approved earlier this year, and the total welfare that a family of 4 would get this year aggregates nearly $40,000. If you only get your news from CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Huffington Post, Reddit, Yahoo, Politico, ABC, CBS, NBC and other leftwing Democratic party propaganda outlets you probably didn't know that a family of 4 received that much welfare in 2021, which goes a long way to explaining why there are around 11 million open jobs right now that employers can't fill, and around 9 million fewer workers now than pre-pandemic. Now the Dems want to pass another $3.5 to $5 TRILLION ""human infrastructure"" bill which includes even more welfare that will make it even that much more difficult for employers to find employees willing to work for a living rather than sit at home waiting for the zoo keeper to slide the food under their cage door. Dems have achieved a lot of political power by playing plantation politics and enslaving Americans via welfare."
I don't know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
FDX should go up in coming weeks. It looks there is a lot of support between $215-220 so safe entry point is now for long term gains. Workers shortage should be temporary as additional government PUA benefits has ended. Also recently numbers of job openings is decreasing. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August and 11.1 million openings in July.
"averaging down from 277 with some 230. giddy up! labour shortages, wages, who isn't dealing with those problems right now. you're buying FedEx for the moat. The mail has got to get delivered, and it's going to be a someone in a FedEx uniform at your door."
Earnings beat will take this to $300! Please go read/listen to previous earnings call. They strategically called it out…don’t listen to the hedges! BUY!!!!
Volume has stair-stepped down significantly since the fall from 250. I’m comfortably in at 220. The last of the Fund houses will be selling today for window dressing their quarterly statements. Those same Funds will repurchase tomorrow morning. It’s shameful but true. UP FROM HERE!
Good dividence stock. why drop so hard. Short is giving more discount?
Sounds like they need people to work in order to operate their business…
"double bottom. Head up to 251, FDX?"
$FDX Maintains Stifel Nicolaus Buy USD 344 » USD 283 Target Lowered by Argus Positive » Buy USD 330 » USD 270 Target Lowered by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 375 » USD 280 Target Lowered by Loop Capital Buy USD 381 » USD 324
Completely oversold
accumulate state. loading more.
What a day to buy more of this
"Should hold today, could see 228 before the day is done"
pre pandemic they were $144 pps. Are they worth 50%+ more today?
"Really, just bought stock, call options, and wrote some puts. $300 by year end"
Check 5 years chart FedEx always had big drops then big run It’s a one time buying opportunity. Don’t be scared FedEx won’t go bankrupt. Lol
FDX IS OVER SOLD... I'M ADDING SHARES. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FREIGHT SITTING IN CONTAINERS. PEOPLE NEED TO GO BACK TO WORK.. FDX IS HIRING. ALL THE LOGISTICS COMPANIES NEED WORKERS. THE PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED IN ORDER TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN EVERY AREAS.
Next earnings report will be much better due to upcoming holidays. Management will solve labor shortages issue. Stock price for FDX may raise to 300 by end of this year.
Who’s the biggest bag holder here I’m down 7k
Amazing how FDX has beat the last 3 quarters and now some people think it is a sell.
FDX just demonstrated what happens when MANY packages are late. Time in transit is very important to customers and they are brutal when you don't do what you say you will and offer up excuses.
"Ready to head up to 250+ station, FDX!"
"fdx has a lot of debt ...even if you back out cash ... close to $30B debt... so what is fdx really worth? i dont like it even at this price ... there are better opportunities out there in energy, financials, commodities, ...gl"
450$ by next year will only give it a PE of 19. 225 is a screaming buy
"I will continue to make small buys each week as the valuation is just too low. Right now labor related issues are an issue, but ultimately FDX will pass those along. They have an incredible moat business and the Amazon argument is overdone. E-commerce continues to bloom and Amazon is not the only player. Current shipping companies can barely handle the demand. We are on a downtrend, so you have to be in this for the long play."
Time to buy this great company at a huge discount
They had some interesting insights about FDX on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Do not sweat it buy the DIP !
This stock is WAY oversold. Check stats against biggest competitor UPS. There will be a major correct here.
"The sell off of fed ex is by people who should have never bought, and had no business owning fed ex, so thanks for the AWESOME buying opportunity. it was this price 2 quarters ago!! Talk about a chance to time travel. My fedex dude was here after labor day weekend, with all the sales. he told me he had more on his truck than last XMESS!! AND he isn't an employee, even tho he wears the shirt, he is the subcontractor like MOST of them. And the trucks THEY lease and wrap. Lawyers, dics, judges, CNBC, everyone always tells you FOLLOW THE MONEY!! Where did all this money go? sidelines? No inventory of homes to toys, boats to cars? NOT! The guys on BOTH sides of me just bought brand new trucks! Now they have payments, and they work, so they aren't THAT smart, but i digress. there is plenty of inventory, unless you want a RED or BLUE one!Lastly, if the market is forward looking 12 to 18 months, then look BACK 12 to 18 and, using your brain, and you see how we got HERE. Now, look at NOW, and look out 12 to 18.Long term investor, bravo, because for you that 12 to 18 is YEARS not months!"
Giddy up!
"FedEx Freight had strong revenue growth AND record high profit margins. How come that division didn't suffer from the so-called labor cost inflation and shortages that FedEx is blaming for the poor profit margins in their other divisions? FedEx has a senior management problem, and they need to take a hard look at making some needed changes sooner than later. They have significant competitive advantages over both UPS and USPS in terms of lower cost structure and more flexibility due to a largely non-union work force, and also have overall faster transit times than both UPS and USPS. Let's hope that the so-called labor supply problem will improve now that the extra $300 a week unemployment that the Democrats gave Americans to stay at home to play on FB, IG, Twitter, and watch Naked and Afraid has expired, and federal court ruled that Dems can't prohibit landlords from being able to evict people who refuse to pay their rent! Dems also increased food stamp payments by 25% (SNAP), and the amount of annual welfare that we pay parents for each child they have to $3,600. Hard to believe millions of Americans could make more money staying at home and collecting welfare and not paying rent while there are a record number of open job vacancies totaling nearly 11 million, but that's the playbook of the Democratic party. The more people they get to stay home and dependent on government, the more votes and Democratic politicians they get elected. Same plantation politics that have served Democrats well since the founding of the country."
"Many of the negative comments seem to be of disgruntled employees or people referencing the on time delivery rate. Although FDX needs to preform in order to keep up its reputation, it does not trade on those metrics. So while you reference the 78% on time “ground” delivery rate(what they are least known for) I will compare them to peers, profit margin and dividend growth rate and payout ratio."
Long term winner. Rev was strong and would have been stronger. People costs will effect every company this year. AMZN people costs will be thru the roof compared to last year. They just happen to be the first to report. FDX tech advances and higher pricing is a nice set-up for later.
"This price action is insane. Each day a new 52-week low, C’mon, !"
I heard about FDX the other day on (http://Pick-stocks.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I wonder who is selling at this very low prices
How about a little bounce here. Way oversold.
"this month we have lost over $45 per share and it continues to go down, I can't imagine how long it will take to recover this months loses. "
"I have heard from folks working there that they have severe execution problems. Unfortunatley, I own it in the $270's. I thought it would be bad but not this bad."
"market drop is dragging down FedEx today, I'm adding to my position"
$ATVI $CLX $FDX im glad i dodged these when i sold it last year..
246.03M short float/ 267M OSFDX is over shorted. And more shares were borrowed today to control the price down. This is a good discount from short. getting some today and look forward for FDX going back to 253.
"Lost $42K on call options a couple of months ago thinking this stock was worth at least $305. Boy was I wrong, and had to sell some CLF to offset so that my wife wouldn't kill me when she does the taxes next year! CNBC just said FDX is currently trading at near historic low PE ratio based upon next year's consensus EPS, and appears cheap. Recent sentiment thinks that FDX suffered and will continue to suffer much higher wage inflation in the near term due to so many American workers who preferred to stay home and collect the extra $300 a week in federal unemployment welfare that just ended, the 25% increase in food stamp payouts (SNAP program), increase in welfare paid for each child from $2,400 to $3,600, federal gov't / CDC telling landlords they couldn't evict tenants who refused to pay their rent, $2,000 stimulus checks, and other welfare programs that the Democrats approved in order to get as many American dependent upon the government so that more Democrats would get elected next year. The plantation politics being played by the marxist/progressive Democrats will eventually lead to our military being decimated to pay the interest on the massive federal debt, much higher taxes and fees on everyone, and high inflation. Our national debt is now nearly $30 trillion versus the $10 trillion when Obama took office, and there's more than $20 trillion of additional unfunded liabilities associated with Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other welfare programs. The $50 trillion equates to more than $150,000 of debt for each man, woman, and child in AmeriKa! If you happen to be one of the roughly 50% of American adults who happen to pay federal income taxes in any given year, you're portion of the debt is much, much higher! As the interest rates on the 10 Year Treasuries normalize and increase from the current ~1.35% to around the historic average of around 6%, the ANNUAL interest expense to service the national debt will increase by more than $1.3 TRILLION!!!! Socialism/progressivism/marxism will result in a lot more poverty and a lower standard of living for vast majority of Americans. Venezuela used to be the richest country in S. America before they adopted socialism/progressivism/marxism. Just a few short years later it's a poor third world country where some of the citizens are eating cats and dogs."
Not sure how wall street didn't expect this report. Higher wages = less profit margin. Pretty simple... Still bullish long term on the record growth
Market has just realized that this delivery titan can't stay at this low price
This is a CEO issue and NOT a supply issue or labor issue. Those excuses are BS. Stock at a 52 week low and the CEO still has a job? And the CEO gets paid how much????
everyone first mistake is listening to CNBC
How many winners did you have last month? How about this week? If you don’t get at least one solid pick in your inbox a week you are doing something wrong. Change that now by joining (http://financialdeals.tech).
"I see 230, 240, and 250 in the near future. Maybe during the Christmas rally!!!"
"USPS contract with fdx ends Sept 2024. Two years away. USPS is fdx’s largest customer. Fdx uses its airplanes to line haul USPS’s time sensitive express and first class packages between hubs. Planning and building a USPS replacement network strategy is going on right now. Part of a possible strategy would be renegotiating the fdx contract. However alternative strategies would involve other air carriers, rail or over the road line hauls. (For example something like the UPS train)There are too many strengths for USPS, in a negotiation with fdx, to project any price increase possibility IMO. Especially now that USPS is run by a supply chainer that is competent with consolidation and distribution network analysis. Fdx is on the ropes. Large customer volume loss will do significant damage to fdx air density. They already lost the amazon density that use to make last mile non-amazon packages more profitable. Now the line haul costs will be going up (even if fdx makes a deal to continue USPS line hauls)"
"I don’t considered the current trading ranges as dip. When its gets to 215-220, that I will recognize as dip."
"So forward PE = 10 (assuming they make $23 for 2022, personally I think they will make much much higher aided by resolution of labor shortage and price increases)For a high quality mega cap stock.That does not happen in today's market very often."
Gonna make a move up soon to fill the gap down from the $260 level.
Looks like $FDX went to all time high of $319 and came back to the price it was last year. Heavy loss holding this stock no growth. Not sure how much it will drop tomorrow $235?
"Let me see if I fully understand.FedEx got absolutely clobbered today because their earnings missed estimates by 50 cents .Since FedEx has around 266 million shares , that means that despite earning over 1.1 billion dollars this quarter, the street had a collective heart attack over a 133 million dollarearnings shortfall.This of course was justification for taking almost 6 billion dollars off of FedEx market cap .It’s all rigged ."
Going to break $200 to $160 now. Rising oil prices will hit this hard.
"By year end, FDX will be over 300 - buy as much of this now, as you can - all bad news has been discounted - pessimism is rampant - up we go - cheers."
"This looks like a great buy and forget type deal for a IRA. 90b revenues and only 60b market cap? That sounds like a significant undervaluation to me. Buyers at these levels can easily expect at least 15% annual returns all while getting that dividend. A incredibly boring, yet incredibly good buy here!"
"According to macroacis, fdx has a 41% chance of some form of bankruptcy during the next two years. For comparison, ups has a 13% chance and ge has a 6% chance…"
"With holidays coming FedEx and UPS will go higher. Considering that it already dropped 50% from its high, it become a defensive play for most traders"
accumulation time
WMT should buy FedEx at these levels.Would be immediately accretive to earnings.
So it looks like they want this at or below $225 on Friday options exp.
"i love when big, established companies have a fire sale, such as fdx. got to have patience, but you know it's going to appreciate 20% in the next 12 mos. Im all in on oil right now (and loving it!), but another 15% appreciation there and I will rotate to a stock like fdx."
"When FedEx figures out how to deliver packages to the correct address, on-time, or at all, on a consistent basis, it means that Hell is about to freeze over."
my average is now 228. Now just wait for a trillion christmas deliveries...
"Amaz and FedEx both are going to be hitting lows, Etsy is a much better buy right now. UPS is also going strong and nobody wants to work for FedEx and will look for other jobs first, FedEx has one or two good hubs the rest have poor employee relationships. Let us not forget shipping increases each year to cover its loss of earnings. Starting January 6, 2020, FedEx rates will increase by 4.9%, on average. This increase applies to FedEx Express package and freight standard list rates. The rates apply to deliveries in the US as well as export and import into and out of the US. FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery will also see a 4.9% increase. Sep 20, 2021 — (NYSE: FDX), will increase shipping rates on January 3, 2022. FedEx Express shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9% for the U.S.Customers will ship less and only as needed with FedEx and go elsewhere for a lower cost."
"Very cheap valuation. Great company temperory blip.Buy now for long termThey have been shorting all along these issues are all known to the street, $250 easyGl!"
I just keep.looking at the one year chart and smiling. getting in today is an early christmas gift!
"Great price to buy it, in my opinion 30% upside"
They had some interesting insights about FDX on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"""we maintain our P/E multiple of around 16x, translating into FedEx Valuation of $326 per share, compared to $348 earlier. Despite a -6% revision to our price estimate for FDX stock, it remains at a premium of over 40% to the current market price of around $230. We believe that investors can use the recent dip as a buying opportunity for long-term gains."" (Forbes, today)"
Last chance to buy the dip?
"CEO gets $50 million pay package, go into open market and buy shares. Show some confidence in the company."
"Total AH bloodbath. More than than specific to FDX this report will feed the narrative of accelerating inflation, followed by stagflation - both bad for larger indices prospects e.g., S&P 500. The Fed is boxed in and sooner than later will have raise rates to counter the destructive effects of unbridled inflation, a bad development for transports and the overall market. This FDX report alone could be a major impetus for a real stock market correction - 20% plus downdraft - for a market priced at historical extremes."
It's the macro economy. FDX may out perform its peers but it doesn't mean to say with money contraction and less stimulus the 'real' economy will show its colours and normalisation will mean a reversion to real asset valuations based upon M2 rather than mounting government debt and freebies
Slowly and surely to 200$.
"In looking to add another company to my portfolio, I'm checking out FDX. I've always liked the company and admired CEO and founder Fred Smith, but it concerns me when a founder who has built and run a successful company from the beginning nears retirement. Smith is 77. Thoughts?"
I bought 800 shares today. . Once in a year or two opportunity.. If you look at dip in Feb-Apr 2020 it only to 3-5 months to roar back..
"A must-read if you own FedEx Stock and this is why FedEx is going to sink and not be its Federal Express of old good times. The U.S. Postal Service wants to move more of its mail volume by ground instead of air, which would mean less mail for FedEx Express cargo jets to transport.The agency released a 10-year plan Tuesday it says will return it to financial sustainability and improve its delivery services. One piece of that plan would be to change service standards for First-Class Mail, which currently provides delivery in 1-3 business days.“By adjusting First-Class Mail service standards by one or two days for certain mail, we can move First-Class Mail from air transportation, which is costly and unreliable, to ground transportation,” the Postal Service says on its website. “This will improve the reliability and predictability of service for customers, while reducing expensesFedEx Express, FedEx’s largest company, provides airport-to-airport transport in the U.S. via its fleet of cargo jets for the Postal Service under a contract expiring in 2024. The transport is for First-Class Mail, Priority Mail Express and Priority Mail within the country. FedEx Express also provides it with international transportation and delivery.In its 2020 fiscal year, the Postal Service paid FedEx more than $2.2 billion for its services, according to research from David Hendel, a partner at Culhane Meadows PLLC who compiles USPS supplier data annually. This was $174 million more than in fiscal 2019.How much of FedEx’s business with the Postal Service deals with First-Class Mail specifically is unclear. The only reason FedEx is still standing as a large company is the Postal Service after Fred loses the contract with the Postal Service it will be a much smaller company, I can see the Postal Service start its moving ground plan and start shipping air in 2023 on a large scale and year 2022 texting trails. Any thoughts I'm open to hearing just not from FedEx loser management who have no clue how to clean their own rear and blame the wipes"
"FDX has been sliding 10% for a month. Today’s sell-off is another 10% and represents a single-stock correction into bear territory. This seems to be the new norm of rolling corrections. If so, then this could be a wizard time to buy. It may take a while, but with the holiday season approaching, if FDX can learn from their mistake and position properly, we could see a slow, but significant rise from here."
"There is NO WAY this stock should be 30%, or nearly $100, off its high. Yes, they have labor issues - but sakes are very strong, getting better, and high season is coming up. It is WAY oversold."
fdx trading where it was this time in 2018. what happened?
Notice the timing in announcing their 6% rate increase for next year…on the eve of their earnings announcement. Think they’re looking for cover?? Bad News??
Well sold my puts for today now that the bill passed one level to avoid a shutdown maybe this can start swinging up tomorrow
Got a few more shares today at 226.55
"any stock goes up Cramer would say BUY BUY BUY , goes down Cramer would say SELL SELL SELL i really dont understand why CNBC sign new contract with him for another few years"
How is the world can this drop 100 points. CEO needs to go
High labor and fuel costs are here to stay. FDX is dead money for years to come.
USPS raising prices and slowing deliveries… a plus for FDX
"$FDX A lot of eyes on it this weekend. Hope they don't get these cheapies before longs who should know better, get a chance yo."
"Wow what a sale  buying in,been waiting for months for this dip"
"Finally market think the inflation pressure is built in the price already, and FDX business still good, reflation! Let’s go North!"
Oil going to $130 a barrel will drive FDX to $175..yikes!
I would buy a little bit on these dips. FDX should rebound eventually.
I think they might have exhausted the $230 level.
"Bottom is almost in....bounce soon. Now we need high volume with move to upside.$255 and change is true support and I seriously doubt it goes there, but if it does, then it will not last.CURRENT PRICE259.69, just above support, 254.95 ± 3.57 type triple, strength 9SUPPORT BELOW-1.8% at 254.95 ± 3.57 type triple, strength 9RESISTANCE ABOVE+2.5% at 266.15 ± 3.73 type triple, strength 10+5.1% at 273.06 ± 3.82 type double, strength 4+8.4% at 281.51 ± 3.94 type double, strength 10"
It should hold today lol
way oversold territory
I heard about FDX the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
$FDX $ADBE $NKE those are buy?
"its been a tough week for fedex, yet they are busier than ever the following weeks will prove more properous!!"
11% gain after ERmark this post !money back guarantee if you keep the receipt !
"I hate fedex.I ordered a standing desk 2 weeks ago .4 parcels in total.I have only been delivered 2 parcels.I get no notice that they are being delivered and no sign of the next parcels being delivered.The fact that you do not ship and deliver the 4 parcels at the same time,taking multiple deliveries is losing your money and #$%$ off customers.This say a lot about your company and is reflected in the share price today"
Loved this sale today i hope it drops a bit lower so i can buy more
"volume nearly doubled yesterday, I wish they would break it up. (buying/selling)"
Autonomous vehicle company Aurora recently launched a partnership with FedEx (FDX) to test the use of self-driving trucks to ship goods between Dallas and Houston.
"Been averaging in over the past few days. Going to buy a few more if it goes down, $255 by Christmas!"
"Funny how Costco is doing fantastic, and they pay amazing wages and have extreme low turnover. It just depends on if the company cares about employees or not."
"Wow, this thing needs viagra to keep it up. Ok, so bought another 500 shares today and will just wait for the people that want to sell to finish selling. At some point they will exhaust their need to sell and it will rebound to a true value of $300 ++"
Done buying shares buying puts after that ride up this morning
"Down big and will see more downturn in this lost FedEx management and with Biden if office cutting off USA oil. The USA is now dependent on Canada and Latin America, Africa, and the Persian Gulf. Crude is going up and up this is not good news for FedEx. I have been doing the study and just may get back in at 150.00 or 120.00 the Holidays season is not going to help any as China is picking who gets what and when. What delivery service does China use?Postal Service - China Post. China Post is the official postal service in China, offering both domestic and international mail and parcel services. With the rapid development of online shopping and international trade, more and more parcels and packages are transported by post from China to the whole world. As for international shipping, DHL Express service is usually the fastest shipping option with completed deliveries in up to three business and days cost less. In a nutshell, FedEx has managers who care more about themselves than the ground workers, sort, ramp, courier. Yet I saw a FedEx paper saying how much these workers are Hero's made my stomach upset with such lies of caring. Talk is cheap I would like to see some action. FedEx is not wanting lower hard workers to retire from FedEx it just puts lots of smoke, I did the research for one an early retirement worker pays back the pension check just to cover the retirement health insurance, not part of the check the entire check and maybe a couple hundred more. Now how is a 62 year old going to live when you give back your retirement check to FedEx just to cover your health, oh go on Obama care? and this is because FedEx does not help cover the cost of a 25 or 30-year worker dumped to the curb. Who would want to stay good workers quit no way to retain, and there is more just not now already spent to much time with this info"
Great entry point at these levels
"Volume picked up. get ready to gap up and fly back to 251, FDX."
"FedEx stock remains a buy despite its earnings miss because the company is well-positioned to stay an industry leader, grow its business, and benefit from the surging e-commerce industry. The company is in for a challenging holiday season, and it wouldn't be surprising to see its margins take another hit in the coming quarters.Fiscal year 2022 could prove to be a weak year if FedEx continues to face higher costs and compressed margins -- which would look particularly bad compared to FY 2021's banner performance. However, FedEx is a value stock that is simply too cheap to ignore. Even if it hits the low end of its reduced guidance, the company would have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.7 -- placing it in bargain bin territory. Considering FedEx's challenges are mostly macro and the business itself is firing on all cylinders, FedEx looks like a great industrial stock to buy now."
"If you can't make record profits with record margins with unprecedented demand and capacity constraints every where....then you don't have a very strong CFO, VP Pricing / Revenue Management, and VP of HR. Tight labor constraints throughout industry can easily be mitigate by higher prices to cull the packages and freight that aren't covering total variable and fixed costs plus a healthy profit margin. FedEx should be charging Walmart and other Enterprise customers much higher prices now, just as Walmart and the other Enterprise customers make the carriers take price decreases or no annual increase during low demand periods. If FedEx has competent management, which is a big IF given a Marketing guy is the CEO and COO, their profit margins should snap back when they report Q2 results."
"Started a position yesterday at 228.90 going to wait a bit to add to it, just being patient."
Price targets are $100 higher than current price and I will just buy and wait. That is a ~ 40% gain. If it takes a year then OK?
Retest of 216 before another bounce.
loaded 1000 shares at 221
"Whenever there is more shorty messages, this means shorty is very desperate for your cheap shares. This I know is one universal trading law."
How long do I need to hold this bag just to break even is the question!
RSI 18.51 . . . one of the biggest oversold positions I have ever seen with a $61B mkt cap. P/E 11.84. Even with some downgrades 36% or $313 upside. Very strong balance sheet. AMZN competition is not the big question: will FDX solve their labor costs and be able to hire enough workers for this coming Christmas season? Risk/reward . . . and big reward if they are successful.
Very strong support @ or above $228? Any thoughts?
I like using FedEx for its quick and very efficient delivery. FedEX is not going anywhere.
235 close tomorrow. 250 next week. 350 Christmas holidays shopping.
I would buy at $130
Market players with big enough pockets and trading infrastructure drive every stock of significance up and down in a wide range. The game is to play some news to force investors to sell. It's the every-day game. Just do this experiment. Buy a stock for more than 10000 value and you will not see it that day coming above your purchase price. It will drip drip drip until you sell and then immediately goes higher. Market makers buy your data from your bank. They know what your position is and they have all the info that they can have to force you to sell at a loss. Day-trading for retail is a losing game. Watch this goodie trading lower for the next 1-5 days and then see it going back to pre-crash level. FDX is a great company. It will be over 300 by the year end. But it will trend higher only after wiping out as many retail as possible.
"Buy after the bell, even if earnings is good Wall Street will bring it down before it goes back up, it always happens."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"And we are almost back, everyone having fun on the rollercoaster yet? Lol"
"sorry folks, but i continue to think fdx is heading towards ch11...- near junk rated debt- funded new assets using debt instead of fcf- loosing market share- dividend increase - excessive service failuresIt's hard to get a handle on fdx when most of the ground services are outsourced. What's the status of the outsourced equipment - age of fleet high? Excessive maintenance cost? We know the labor is impacting cost to operate. finally, altman z score in the grey area (although better than last two years)...So bankruptcy or someone else buys it out???"
"Going to be interesting watching fdx marketing and sales response this year and next:1) Lost Amazon final mile delivery (old news)2) Possible loss of USPS volume in 2024. USPS is fdx’s biggest customer. Amazon was fdx 2nd largest customer. Fdx serves premium market - not first choice for b2b and with service failures, a questionable choice for b2c. And then there’s all those poor financial and operational decisions. Increased dividend, replace fleet assets using debt instead of fcf, squeeze contractors, service failures, price increases. More negatives than positives here…"
Time to celebrate up 91¢ for the week
go fdx
"Under value, way over sold!"
"tripple lindy dive , the rest of the week!!"
The quality of service at FedX ground is getting much worse. The USPS announced it would slow down delivery time to save money and I wonder if FedX is doing the same. All three of my last deliveries were at least one full day late.
"stock is beat up bad. at this price it's undervalued and oversold. just the facts.regardless of a bad ER or decreased future guidance, FDX isn't going anywhere. i conservatively see 250$ by xmas"
They just announced raising shipping rates in Jan 2022.
Everything green and this is down and down AH also. Makes sense.
"If yesterday was the bottom, then I caught the falling knife in a huge way."
"Howard, it's not over a 133 million dollarearnings shortfall. FedEx (FDX) lowered its earnings outlook for full-year 2022 after missing fiscal first-quarter earnings views and blaming it on labor its always FedEx go to, blame the worker, not the leaders who are giving out the plans to mess up a once good company. You would think Fred would man up and take the blame for running the company into the ground.

might it be wise to short this and purchase ups (1.25 shares for every fdx stock sold ) better divedend and for some reason the market believes a better plan. Just a question
(http://trademarketview.tech) is my favorite stock advice newsletter. The daily emails inform me of everything I need to know to trade more wisely each day. Don’t know what I’d do without them!
"""By any traditional valuation measures, FedEx is historically cheap. FedEx is currently trading at a PE of 12, or half of its historical valuation. If we took a 20% discount on the company's historical valuation and applied a PE of 20, we'd have a projected stock price of $498.80 two years from now. Sticking strictly with the historical PE of 24.76, we would get a stock price of $618, a 172% gain."" (Seeking Alpha)"
"strange, im home researching all day. see tons of fdx trucks.....5 to 1 over ups. good sign"
this is tied directly to the price of fuel and energy prices!
"Bought more at $217 this morning, what a bargain!!!!! Heading to $275 by the EOY!"
"Great business, still undervalued @ 230, buy on the weakness, and hold!"
Daily RSI under 20 on a big stock like this.. Load the boat under $235
"Ha, I bought some today not even realizing earnings were tonight. Also bought some ABNB, so about flat on those 2. No big deal, a long term buy, but guess I could have waited a day."
Loading up!!
hurry up to buy at this bargain price
Got some this morning at 228.90. Just a position amount though not loading the boat just yet
wow! seems overdone to me. give it a few days to settle down and see if 240 holds. UPS has got to be seeing the same pressures
Closing above $230 or $231? Looks like $231 is the pivot point. Do not sell low!
"You can barely find a stock that is down today. You can always count on FDX due to ongoing mismanagement. No end in sight, unfortunately… looks like a big write off at tax time for most people."
"I cant wait to buy more of this, its really oversold, the market is over reacting to this is going back up to the new highs, shorts are to busy posting bearish comments lol, but fedex us here to stay so is the e commerce bussines"
Now it’s a 4 point drop lol
"fedex is booming on cash revenue we will see 270 soon enough , have some patience for the love of god!"
Down over 100 points since the high and failing more this morning and this CEO still has a job? Losing Billions in market value and the CEO gets paid millions? Something wrong with this picture?
"That was a miss. However, I am buying. Bought another 600 shares in AH"
"I operate out of two locations & I was concerned for about 2 months but, past 4 weeks have seen quite a surge in business once again. buying little more."
Why FDX PE is 14 while UPS PE is near 27….Is it because FDX dropped before earnings release?
"FDX's labor problems are only going to get worse if the Dems are able to pass more welfare spending. They've already increased welfare per child from $2,000 a year to $3,600, and food stamp payments by 25%...the highest in the history of the SNAP food stamp welfare program! A family of 4 just saw their welfare income increase by another $5,000. Now the Dems want to add new welfare programs for free college, day care, and more people getting free healthcare. Lot's of college kids work at UPS and FDX at night to help pay for college. If college becomes ""free"", then thousands more will leave the part time work force."
Another down day. For Most when this roller coaster ride ends you'll need a ladder to get back to ground level. How many rungs does your ladder have
FDX labor problems are only going to get better. People are only 3 weeks out from receiving free unemployment benefits. They will start feeling the pain soon and flock to jobs like those offered by FDX.
