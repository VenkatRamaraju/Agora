Well come on when Cramer told his subscribers to sell UPS and didn't like FDX as much......YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING UP!
is that UPS dust we're eating hopefully their numbers next week are good and we can rise on their coattails
FDX should go up in coming weeks. It looks there is a lot of support between $215-220 so safe entry point is now for long term gains. Workers shortage should be temporary as additional government PUA benefits has ended. Also recently numbers of job openings is decreasing. There were 10.4 million job openings at the end of August and 11.1 million openings in July.
"""By any traditional valuation measures, FedEx is historically cheap. FedEx is currently trading at a PE of 12, or half of its historical valuation. If we took a 20% discount on the company's historical valuation and applied a PE of 20, we'd have a projected stock price of $498.80 two years from now. Sticking strictly with the historical PE of 24.76, we would get a stock price of $618, a 172% gain."" (Seeking Alpha, ""FedEx will still deliver"")"
Is this a good time to buy? Will the upcoming holiday rush give it a big bump upwards November through to January?
needs to close above$234 before it will consistently move higher. need some positive news from the management team.
"With the holiday season rapidly approaching, I have to say that this is a great price to buy, despite the jump today."
Started a position today on Gordon Reidâ€™s advice on Market Call. In at $230.38 
"great company, holiday season ahead, bargain price, obvious uptrend from the bottom: we are going up"
"strange, im home researching all day. see tons of fdx trucks.....5 to 1 over ups. good sign"
"still a very good price to load or add, huge upside from here. Buy all you can and hold"
"If business is good for UPS it's generally good for FedEx. I'm guessing the hiring is going well. Deliver the packages, collect the money. Repeat."
A nice bounce off $225 last week. UPS results helped sentiment now. We are running higher. Lots of momentum now.
Any fellow FedEx holders also buying the dip on Facebook? Thank you.
"Hold your shares, guys! Don't worry too much about the price today, tiny volume!"
"According to a recent Shipper Survey the average discount off list rates that FDX offers their ground customers who spend $500K to $1M a year on parcel shipments is 75%, whereas the average discount that UPS offers these same sized customers is 15%. According to the survey results for Air Express, customers spending between $0 to $100K per year have an average discount of 55% vs 0% for UPS. For customers spending between $500K to $1M on AE services, FDX's average discount is 75% vs 15% for UPS. The survey shows that FDX was much more aggressive at trying to win business (which primarily means using higher discounts & lower prices) from UPS from around 1Q2019 up to 2Q 2021. The good news is that the entire gap between FDX and UPS aggressiveness has nearly closed recently according to this survey. Finally, the survey shows that customers are only expecting AE and Ground price increases from FDX of 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, which is well below what customers are expecting UPS to increase their prices by. Shippers are expecting UPS to raise their Air and Ground prices by 5.5% and 5.0%, respectively, next year. There appears to be a significant difference in expectations between what FDX and UPS sales people are messaging to their customers about price increases next year, and is yet another piece of evidence that FDX may have problems with their Revenue Management / Pricing strategy. Perhaps their salesforce hasn't been trained to effectively sell the value of FDX, and/or their variable pay doesn't have a yield component. The good news is that any potential pricing problems are fairly easy to fix."
Wow......Amazon passed FedX in total delivery volume......this explains much......

And they laughed when it was suggested FDX would hit $230 this week. Nice.
FDX is so undervalued stock now.ER is respected in Dec.$280 is the target after the good ER at UPS.
