"someone gave me thumbs down when today i said ""fdx forming head and shoulders still needing to create the right side neck line on monthly chart..looks like lower highs next 2 months""...how's that price action working for ya after hours? Nothing saying it won't recover tomorrow or next week, but someone certainly is selling the news on ""good earnings"""
back to 290 real fast and 300. its a dirt cheap stock. Spend some of that facebook money
Did anyone see the news from CNBC today about FDX Rise
"Plug nose, keep buying. Bought 1000 shares, wrote 13 puts, bought 65 Call options. This is gonna go back to $300 in short order. UPS states that demand in US is slowing due to reopening, but UPS PE was out of wack. FedEx is doing fine and the PE is low."
"looks like ^vin, ^vix & ^vif are throwing a party..."
"jennifer already claimed $14,000 was made on fdx in 24 hours. doing the math that's approx $14K / (293-288) * 288 = $806,500 total investment in one stock. okay jennifer is buying on margin or has a big checking account or options or straddles the transaction.I work with a lot of very smart people that work all kinds of deals in the market. I even work with one that sells unexpired company granted stock options under contract in order get ""at the cash"". but at the end of the day it would be interesting to see what they net. I suspect it's not worth the effort. There are less risky ways to get $14K-$50K using $806,500 in the short term…"
"Today closed or partially closed the gap from 4/27. Might need to hit that level again, but does not need to happen soon or even ever..."
"michael, lol you crack me upFDX outpaced the crashing today and will continue up and up and up so if you didnt take profits when it was down ( since you shorted or bought puts) then that was greedy of you and now you pay the price of a loss"
"today, fdx was upgraded by Maintains Credit Suisse: to Outperform 6/25/2021 and plus Dividend day, then FDX will be green for sure"
LOL LOVE IT PERFECT MARKET BUT FDX IS OUTPACING THE MARKET AND WILL BE UP AND OVER 300.00 REAL SOON
FDX Air Freight Market to Generate $376.8 Billion by 2027: Allied Market Researchlooks like fdx might be a split once we get to 400.00
Looks like another day of sell into the close. Big funds still dumping.
Forward PE under 12 and PEG ratio of 1 will drop further when they continue to beat earnings. Payout ratio of 15%…..Can share buybacks and divi increases be far away? They have proven they can perform during lock downs but will benefit of return to B2B……both FDX and UPS taking price which is great inflation hedge. Cash Machine!!! DYODD.
They have sold it down way too much. Overdone is an understatement.
"Ok, that was a tripppple bottom. Next stop is over $300 and beyond. Close green today."

"who's the big dog? ups market share = $184Bfdx market share = $77.6Bups financials fully reflect operations, while fdx has a surface package contractor model. it's not easy to see into fdx. is it well run? for one, fdx has separate surface and express delivery vans. duplicating routes and pickup? redundant? ya place yah bets and takes ya chances..."
if you think about it this is good for fdx. i see a green day ahead. lower borrowing cost. please stay 288 so i can get more
perfect market before you said FDX was going down and now you say its going sideways ?? your 2 for 2

Just got me a great price on this one
FDX BEAT THE 21 WEEK AVERAGE AND NOW EVERYBODY WANTS TO BUY FDX THE BIGGEST H/F AND INSTITUTIONS ARE ALL JUMPING ON BOARD
Should we have sold today?? Only time will tell but I dont think so.
Anyone here about the new fleet of electric vehicles coming out
"The price went up more than any other tech company. Ofcourse any start up tech company, like FDX will have trouble innitially making chips. But demand for chips is high and FDX can deliver."

who has a link to the earnings call?

CNBC guests confirms BOFA analysis and recommends FDX. They discussed why FDX is better than UPS.I ended up buying some good options this morning.
New Information All Analyst are giving a BULLISH rating for FDX
Just bought my first 800 shares of FDX
"UPS's 2Q revenue growth and updated guidance resulted in their stock going down, and consequently also resulted in the FDX stock price also being pulled down simultaneously. That shouldn't have been the case because UPS is aggressively increasing prices and chasing away Enterprise customers whereas FDX is not pursuing the same ""better, not bigger"" strategy of UPS. Whereas UPS isn't investing much CapEx to expand their brick and mortar capacity, FDX has recently significantly increased their CapEx budget to accommodate a ""better, AND biggerr"" strategy. FDX will have much higher growth than UPS in the near and mid term, and their stock price should not have been negatively impacted by UPS's guidance. FDX should be trading with a PE multiple of around 16x to 18x, whereas UPS should be trading with a multiple of only around 12x to 14x given their lower growth rates. The opposite of what we're seeing today. This is a good time to sell UPS and buy FDX. UPS's strategy of ""better, not bigger"" is only going to open the door for FDX to take share, as well as for DHL and the regional parcel carriers to expand their footprints and take share. Also look for Walmart to significantly grow their logistics asset based infrastructure, much like Amazon did, if FedEx is unable to accommodate them due to capacity constraints and the need to significantly increase prices. UPS's unionized workforce and very high cost structure, coupled with a very conservative executive management team makes it very vulnerable as new technologies emerge lowering the barriers of entry for parcel business. FDX is a bargain at the current price."
buy point at 265. load it up
Just love the downgrades at the bottom. And then the ANALyst's will upgrade when we are at the top.
"WSJ Article Stated: ""The surge in digital commerce-driven package demand is fueling growth beyond the big national parcel carriers. Regional operators including Lone Star Overnight and LaserShip have been expanding well beyond their traditional markets, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, as they look to capitalize while retailers look for fast, cheaper options to deliver packages to customers’ homes. Their expansion comes as an array of delivery, logistics and technology businesses are finding room to grow as alternatives to the sector heavyweights Amazon, FedEx and United Parcel Service. LSO expects its e-commerce business to nearly triple this year. LaserShip’s demand is so strong it has already stopped taking new customers until January. They’re getting a boost from the surcharges the big parcel carriers have imposed as their networks fill up. Even with their rapid growth, the regional carriers still make up a relatively small share of the fast-growing parcel market.""When UPS, FedEx, and USPS refused to invest the necessary capital to significantly expand capacity to handle Amazon's packages efficiently and on time, Amazon decided to invest BILLIONS into building out their own network. FedEx just announced that they are increasing their CapEx budget by roughly 20%, which isn't enough! Far too conservative, and is only opening the door for the low cost, regional carriers to transform themselves into national parcel carriers who will eventually replace the very high cost unionized UPS."
BS manipulation. Hold for 3 days and it will head up. Too good an earnings report to punish this stock. Should be 350-400.
Bank Of America Just upgraded and bought millions of shares
The rsi and the macd havnt been this low in about a year. The forward pe is 13. We should see a bounce this week. The 50 day looks like it is rolling over. I'm on the fence on whether to hold or not if we get back close to 300. Thats just my 2 cents as thats all the profit I have left on this one.
Justin FDX already has the labor shortage taken care of and didn't you hear about UPS issues?
"I agree hedging is the thing to do with FDX, the dividend pay date is a few days away and historical data shows FDX will run up over 20.00"
FDX already has purchased a fleet of green vehicles
Tomorrow lets buy our FDX guys a cold beer and watch FDX go to 305.00 on Tuesday
Great Day now we will be going up FDX showed a lot of Strength today
"Steven p, I understand u are a stock holder and want the company to do good. I promise they are not keeping end customers happy."
It’s impossible to learn Fedx is going down after such a strong earnings. I will add more before tomorrow. Look like it’s just a nice piece of opportunity to buy more when tomorrow come it will turn around 
All those puts expiring today woohoo
"FedEx is now painting their race cars to show their support for black Americans. Really? Hard to believe that in 2021 we would have any publicly traded company in America that is targeting a select group of Americans based upon their race. As a black man, I'm sick and tired of corporations like FedEx, our government, and our media constantly teaching and brainwashing our black children to think they are inferior human beings that require special treatment, affirmative action, and government welfare in order to survive and be successful in America. Didn't we recently elect a black American to be our president....TWICE? The most powerful position in the world! The FedEx paint scheme targeting black Americans is more offensive to me than a white #$%$ who is flying the confederate flag. Both are blatant racism from my perspective. Outrageous that FedEx would adopt a marketing campaign to grow their business based upon the color of my children's skin. Blatant racism by FedEx. Disgusting."
"I said I wish you luck for selling at $290, because I see FDX at $311.57 by eod tomorrow. That's a clear $20+ per share. Bank on it."
"We already did what was projected and broke the 21 week average now its only up and over 305.00 before tomorrow and then we are taking out 320.00, watch"
"Looks like FedX is a Bull, My Hedge Fund says FDX should be $300.00 by tomorrow, that would be nice"
"I was fooled again. I finally got my package from N.Y. to FL, only took 8 days. U can tell the box was repackaged and missing parts, so now I have to wait for rock auto to do an investigation and reship by FedEx. May get my parts by 2022. I think I may have found a stock that is safe to short. If u do not believe me, look up latest reviews."
One of the toughest business environments globally. They beat on all segments and outlook but the street says not good.enough. And the street wonders why people are fed up.

FedEx to invest $100 million in Indian logistics firm Delhivery
"I got a chance to talk to a FedEx employee the other day. She has been with the company for going on 20 years now. Ploys are starting to think that FED EX- is looking to sell their freight division.Here’s Why:Employees have not been given a real substantial raise in several years. Small raises have been given to pacify employees but nothing substantial to keep up with industry piers. Employee benefits I’ve actually been cut and have not kept up with competitors. Employees are not happy with their compensation and benefits, hence rising turnover rates. Many of the CDL class A drivers are taking positions with competitors such as UPS. Many more of these drivers are on the verge of doing the same since competitors like UPS are constantly looking to hire those drivers. Equipment is also not being replaced at anywhere near an acceptable level. I was told that the equipment is aging quickly and not being replaced with new equipment. The lack of reinvestment back into employees and equipment have many thinking FED EX- is simply patting the books and draining the company to make the numbers look good.Anyone looking to purchase the freight division from FedEx would need to know substantial investment is going to be required in this company to retain employees and update the fleet.This is not on the surface but it is what is being talked about inside the company by long-term employees."
Infrastructure bill only supports USPS which will threat FDX!
$FDX They did exact same thing to fedex after earnings a few days on some minor concerns.FDX has been rebounding nicely since then and almost at the same price before the sell off.
"FDX will bounce right back. This went x-div today, also, .75 cents. End Of Month, End of Qtr and end of first half all adding to this and the bounce back will be strong."
No volume. No movements.
a 1.2 bond rate vs a 1.5 bond rate?/ NO BIG DEAL someone seeing ghosts. a 10 year bond is manipulated
FDX- Its a Steal at current 295.x . Will shoot to 340 in short time .. big growth story.. huge demand and such a low PE with good dividends.. am long like all the intelligent ones on FDX.
Well at this point if we can hold between 280 and 300 I'll be fine with it. Unfortunately those 350+ targets seem like pie in the sky but I'm not selling yet. My CLF and X are picking up steam and takes the sting out of this a bit.
what happened to all the pumpers?
"Is it because of pump in price today, or there is something going on after hours?Why a drop of 4+%?"
Where’s the pumpers?
"You know your going over last high price, when you got Bank of America backing you"
This is gonna hit $300 and beyond soon.
"nice jump AH. Apart from beating the estimates, lets hope they give a good guidance for rest of the year and 2022.."
I am long CVS and believe new CFO totally sandbagged assuming Covid vaccine traffic essentially stops….to me very clear that between boosters and all the vaccination mandates for business and travel this traffic will continue for months if not years. $CVS $PFE $FDX are screaming buys as they generate record cash despite low PE and PEG ratios. Good luck fellow “Strategic Value” longs!!
Undervalued anywhere under $300. Should be around $305 soon! Load up
Has anyone seen the news last weekend about the new drone delivery and all the new employees hired?
Did FedEx hire ups management? Slow deliveries.
My guys swear that FDX will be riding high not sure why it was pulled back but I guess thats what happens when you have a money maker like FDX
Nothing to worry about. Some institution just took profit. Gonna be buying more right now at this great price
What is going on lately with this stock. It makes no sense
"Slow deliveries, lie about delivery dates will effect stock price. I never thought that ups would have good services compared to FedEx. Next time I order something I will ask that it be shipped ups or buy from somebody else."
back over 290 this week but we need a good market
It’s heading to 260 territory tmr.
Simply a horrible company to do business with. Watch the pumpers lose money. $300/share is in the rear view mirror.
"Wow just went on a break and come back and FDX is really looking good, there was some new news about electric vehicles today too for FDX"
Overreaction. Glad I bought more.
"FDX is a oligopoly (UPS, AMAZON) with huge momentum (Online retail, solution for supply challenges, vaccine distribution)……with reduced competitive pressure (reduced commercial flights)…..all for a low PE. Price will follow growth trends."
Beep beep beep .... that’s the sound of the truck backing up.
Wow!! Huge numbers.. wasn’t expecting this
Set your sell orders over 400.00 FDX will be breaking loose sooner than you think
Why is FedEx Corporation (FDX) stock crashing? Will it ever recover? Here's what traders and investors say: http://snd.qlitrk.com/r/ymzbs
"Looks like FDX will continue with a div yield >1% ! Slight raise after two years of div freeze.. while UPS maintained >5% yearly DGR, with twice the div yield, and nearly 2x the YTD cap-app- understandably.."
Gotta love the cheap shares under $300.00Keep buying it will go up sooner or later.
"“The rate of new hires and turnover at FedEx have both been steadily climbing for years, according to the Memphis logistics giant's 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance report. FedEx's new hire rate and turnover rate were 43% and 38%, respectively, in fiscal year 2016. Those rates climbed to 71% and 65% in 2020.May 25, 2021”Commercial Appeal website article"
"Still no delivery, filed complaint with Better business bureau, tomorrow will file complaint on rock auto. Will avoid FedEx like democrats."
I wonder about Fedex as I simply see UPS and USPS in and around my town. I almost always use UPS and most businesses I work with do now these days as well. Is this potentially impacting Fedex moving forward?
"Amazon formally launches new Northern Kentucky air cargo hub- logistic management article aug 21, 2021"
"Perfect Market is like a broken record. He's so hung up on this so called debt coming due that Fed Ex has and I don't see that showing up anywhere on their balance sheet. Even if the $2 billion in debt coming due existed Fed Ex has more than ample cash to pay it all down without significantly denting their cash supply, and they have plenty of free cash flow as well. On top of that price targets after the latest quarter are being hiked. And this name is a bargain compared to UPS. My proof of that is the long term growth rate is more than twice the PE. Fed Ex deserves a $500 valuation, not the current price. I like UPS as well but there is no question FDX is attractively valued at these levels. Given the bright future of logistics I see nowhere to go but up from here.Less"
I think UPS/USPS has a better reputation with it customers
"Stock split would really help the price by getting more retail investors involved and higher trading volumes. Don't understand why it's taking them so long to do it. They should have announced it when the stock crossed the $300 threshold. There's no reason for this stock to be trading at such a low PE given it's direct exposure to eCommerce, double digit revenue growth, strong free cash flow of ~$4B over past 12 months, integration of TNT is nearly complete, quasi asset lite model and largely non-union labor force that offers flexibility and lower cost structure than both UPS and USPS, and ability to readily embrace and adopt new technologies to streamline and reduce direct labor expense without having to negotiate with archaic and greedy union leadership. FedEx should be trading at around 18x forward consensus EPS, if not higher. FedEx needs to have the balls to continuously invest significant Capex to expand automation and brick and mortar capacity for the foreseeable future to handle the growth from eCommerce as well as take significant amounts of market share from both UPS and USPS. If they fail to invest the capital to significantly increase automation, expand capacity, and improve service quality.....there will be plenty of new competition who will be willing to do so as the Amazon's of the world have demonstrated time and time again. Time to put the pedal to the metal while UPS hunkers down and significantly reduces their Capex to ""be better, but not bigger."" FedEx needs to show the stodgy old UPS that they can be BOTH better and bigger, which should be the goal of every competent CEO and Board member."
Sold a July 16 302.50 put today to initiate a position. Looking to add this solid company to my portfolio.
"Not to mention the new dividend that was raised, plus going to over 350.00 is a no brainer. Glad to be aboard this ship"
Only down $9 a share now 
FedEx Higher; Bank of America Adds to Top-Pick List on Valuation
"Calling all who won't to make money, look at kplt stock and get in now this will hit soon"
"At FedEx, we employ more than 400,000 U.S. team members who support the economy through the movement of goods and providing related business services. For companies like us, it’s abundantly clear that America’s roads, ports, bridges, rails, and airports are severely stressed. Given these deteriorating conditions, we’re encouraged that a top focus for elected officials in Washington, D.C. is revitalizing our aging infrastructure.It’s been suggested, however, that the way to pay for these improvements is by increasing the income tax rate on corporations like FedEx. As part of this conversation, politicians and the media are misrepresenting American businesses — including ours — seeming to forget our contributions as essential drivers of the economy, innovation, and good-paying jobs.For that reason, I would like to dispel misrepresentations and omissions in media reports about FedEx and other companies related to federal income tax filings. To be clear, we pay all U.S. federal, state, and local taxes FedEx owes, which have totaled nearly $9 billion over the last five fiscal years.Let me also address directly (1) recent misrepresentations about FedEx tax filings the last few years, and (2) corporate taxes overall: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 27 March 2020 (CARES Act) which was passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress included provisions to keep essential transportation services in operation despite a dramatic and unprecedented drop in demand for such services due to the initial surge of the COVID-19 virus — particularly in New York. The CARES Act and the subsequent Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020 resulted in over $48 billion in direct grants and $46 billion in loans to air carriers and other transportation companies and supporting businesses. It also contained several temporary tax measures to enhance financial liquidity for all businesses large and small especially essential logistics companies such as FedEx.Although FedEx was eligible for CARES Act payments and loans, we did not accept any federal funds despite several competitors doing so. Instead, we arranged for loans from the commercial market and subsequently have played a major role in keeping global health care, industrial, and at-home supply chains open. It was the combination of the CARES Act tax measures and the borrowed funds that allowed FedEx to avoid widescale furloughs during the depth of the COVID-19 challenge until our volumes recovered. Prior to the pandemic, a combination of our significantly increased investments due to the lower tax rates and capital expensing provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 (described in my Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal of 20 November 2019) resulted in a temporary reduction in our federal income tax payments over the last several years. Profits from these investments will result in tax payments to the federal government for many years in the future. The major programs and investments we made following the passage of the TCJA are detailed here. These included unscheduled pay increases for team members, contributions to further secure our well-funded U.S. employee pension plan, and major acquisitions of additional Boeing aircraft. As noted in my November 2019 Op-Ed above, the purchase of a widebody aircraft injects nearly $540 million into the U.S. economy and supports 1,850 jobs, and we ordered 24 widebody aircraft in June 2018 because of the TCJA! Please note that the corporate tax provisions in the CARES Act and TCJA are laws, not loopholes, and these provisions allow us to better serve our customers, grow our business with them, and invest in our team members’ work environment, facilities, and software especially during times of uncertainty like the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments are no different than those made by individuals, households, and parents who are affected by tax provisions focused on mortgage interest, child and dependent care, retirement savings, and education tax credits/deductions. Tax laws allow individuals/married couples/parents the ability to direct investment back into their families and households, and business tax provisions are no different.The facts about corporate tax rates:We again reiterate our strong support for the TCJA as the primary beneficiaries of increased investments by large corporations are wage earners. Former Senator Phil Gramm and Mike Solon provided clear data on these benefits in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed of 6 April 2021 including a nonpartisan estimate of economic growth of $6.2 trillion over ten years — “an extra $1,900 of annual income on average for every man, woman and child in America.” Those seeking to raise corporate taxes and discredit the benefits of the TCJA point to the large drop in corporate tax receipts as a percentage of GDP over the past three decades. What they fail to acknowledge, however, is a growing portion of the country’s business tax revenue is"
Ooooo. This dip is a gift. Head fake reaction to UPS. BUYING HERE!
THis was 100% short action and nothing more buy the dips and watch FDX go over 300.00 and then some
LSO expanding overnight services to five states. Rates are “60% of big carrier rate”
"CEO is an under promise/over deliver kind of guy. Always conservative. Too many people push this stock down shirting it for me. When it gets back up to $319, I will be selling half and keeping the rest till end of year. Should be over $350 by thengo longs"
Scott so true i just checked all the historical prices and FDX always goes up at least 20.00 about 7-8 business days before Dividend PAY DATE!!! No brainer is right!
I see a double bottom! $$$
Will be a record 4th quarter and a record year.350 plus by November if not sooner.
"Ryandefinitely not too late, FDX is positioned to be over 305.00 tomorrow and over 320.00 in another week"
Just sent out about 3200 emails to clients that FDX is a HUGE BUY RIGHT NOW and looks like everyone just flooded my email with a thumbs up and buying orders
Back to $300 and over soon. Consolidation before big 3 to 5% up day.
Given tight supply chains many will expedite orders especially if products not too heavy……so they don’t run out of stock. More upside coming!!
Buying op here. I opened positions in 3 accounts below $293

Jim Farr likes FDX based on pandemic. activity. Looking forward I doubt we see 15% growth.
Not hearing anything from Perfectmarket
Shorts are losing so much money with FDX because nobody is selling
They had some interesting insights about FDX on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
just upgraded by Maintains Credit Suisse: to Outperform 6/25/2021
Today should be a really good day
good looking chart. stay long and strong.
Since we got past the 21 day moving average FDX is a sure thing by tomorrow for 305.00 if not sooner and then the bulls are looking to take out 320.00 This is what Im being told by my H/F
289 is a gift. adding more
Shipping costs are sky high. Reason I said this was going under $291.00 and that's exactly what it did.
Why does FDX trade at such a large discount to UPS?
"If you believe in the company then don’t cry and buy more, average down if possible. This company not going anywhere"
It may go up 10-15 ....that's it. It's rangebound.
fdx to 350
China Joe must of took over management of FedEx.
"These businesses... Fedex and UPS .. are only going to get busier and busier. The heat wave in various parts of the country, the ever growing concern over Covid-19 Delta, the fact that more and more people are buying online .. will mean that they will only get busier and busier. Breaking 300, will then gather momentum making this recent move up seem like small potatoes. $335 - $350 coming."
Yep all the puts expiring today will force FDX up another 6.00
Oversold now. Opened new position in two accounts. Added to position to another account. We won’t stay in 280’s long.

What is “increased variable compensation expense” and why did it get mentioned as a negative by fdx today?
"Down again, down 35 last 30 days"
Jim I believe they already did that as well as with the drones that will carry millions of packages everyday
$250 by the end of the week 
"Overall customer ratings for fdx at BBB rating is 1.07 out of 5. Fdx pumpers take notice!“Terribly unreliable. I have never had packages sit in waiting quite like they do with FedEx. The latest mishap is the delay of my work laptop that was sent with two-day priority shipping that they grossly failed to meet. Every time I called I was told they were ""very sorry"" and ""it will definitely arrive tomorrow,"" which it did not. The lack of care and just lies that were being told to me was completely unacceptable. I cannot believe that any company operates this way. Do yourself a favor and use any other shipping service!”"
were going ALOT HIGHER
Thanks to the seller @ 186.37 yesterday.
fed ex is still dirt cheap. i added more today. it will get back over 300 easy. the severe over reaction is a gift. Smells like money
GREAT JOB LONGS EVERYONE BOUGHT DURING THE DIPS CAUSING A HUGE RUN UP AND SHORTS WILL HAVE TO COVERMILLIONS OF SHARES WERE JUJST PURCHASED WATCH FDX OUTPACE UPS AND WATCH FX HIT 300.00 BY TOMORROW
"Never a bad idea to log into corporation home site and listen to conference call. Amazing how many times companies beat estimates and state the word ""HOWEVER"" during conference call and stock gets killed. What I'm saying for an example--However next quarter we expect costs to increase. Just an example"
Buying opportunity!! Yay
"I m with rbc, I can't buy or sell, what platform you guys use for after hour trading."
"Everyone seems to be buying back today, nice dividend coming too! looks like the Street raised their target to 398.00"
"What has happened to FedEx? Order 2 items for N.Y. area, one shiped by FedEx and by ups. Ups item received 3 days ago. Both item's close in sizes and weight."
"*Buy shares of Yellow Corporation (YELL) instead...it’s the nation’s 2nd largest LTL shipper (after FedEx Freight). YELL is in the midst of a major, quiet, turnaround story!  Heavily undervalued, $5B in revenue and 30000+ employees. It currently trades at only $6.75 a share and a market cap of $350M!"
Looks like a sell into the close event today and into the weekend.
"Nasdaq shows 921,000 shares traded in ah.Funny how it plunged right down to 290 and never made it back to even 292.A lot of single and double digit trades largest I saw was 700.Funny how small chump change trades can tank it down 13 points,we shall see tomorrow if its as bad as it appeared.With all those high price targets I cant imagine institutions not getting in but apple has been biting the big 0ne for 6 months and they had a record 1/4."
"My Hedge fund said everyone is buying thousands of shares today, I guess everyone knows that FDX always goes up at least 20.00 before dividend pay date"
"1 start from consumer affairs user (June 20, 2021):""As I was sending a valuable and much needed item, a very small package, I shelled out $ to use FedEx rather than the USPS. Big mistake. 1. On the printed receipt, the delivery date was a full week from send date, already longer than the 1-5 business days you are told. 2. Package failed to arrive on that date. 3. Online Tracking info showed nothing after initial FedEx receiving center near my location, one day after sent — so nothing for 9 days.4. Over the course of 4 phone calls by me and 1 from the intended recipient, customer service reps told us a range of contradictory things, all uninformative and unhelpful. For example: that the address abbreviation was wrong (it wasn’t, and had been generated by the computer at the fedex location where I mailed the package, not by me); that they would investigate and call us back (they didn’t); that there was no investigation request on the file, just an “address correction” request (Kafkaesque); that investigations are not done after this much time, that the recipient had to file a claim; that the sender had to file the claim...5. As I was attempting to file the insurance claim, I was jumped to the tracking page, which now showed the package at a new fedex location in the recipient’s home state — hallelujah! — with the delivery date as the very next day. 6. Package was not delivered. New date is now listed. IF the package arrives in that date, the total delivery time will have been two weeks."""
down for NO reason. Buy the dip
"Back over the 50 day,rsi at 53 and heading up,macd about to cross over baby,dividend coming up and great earnings.Someone tell me whats not to like."
"Cramer: For what its worth, Cramer says the buyers will come rushing in on Monday. While this is a very good entry price for FDX, we will see...we will see."
"UPS has earnings and FDX has dividend pay date and they coincide with each other Wallstreet knows that FDX always runs up big when they pay the dividend, everyone has to cover and buy back in"
Time for the Teamsters Union to make its move. Employees are burned out.
Labor and energy inflation. Macro economy direction. Revenue peaking.Fredex kick the can down the street financing. Fun fun fun…
"June 29 2021 Bank of America added FedEx (ticker: FDX) to its US1 list -- a collection of the bank's best U.S. listed investment ideas -- citing e-commerce growth and margin improvements. Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter set a price target of $372, representing a 26.5% upside from a recent $297.67. The bank removed Union Pacific (ticker: UNP), to make room for"
Obvious question is why would they raise the dividend if things weren't going very well.Obvious answer is they wouldn't.
This dropped in sympathy when UPS disappointed. Now UPS is trying to bounce and this is still heading down.
"I was told that my was just part of 1% failure and that FedEx has great services 99% of the time. We'll test that. Rock auto resent the parts with estimated delivery of Aug 25 21. That is 6 days, tracking # 514577286852. I bet I do not get parts by that date. I am betting 100% failure rate. Any takers for MONEY or just for fun."
Wow!!! Over sold!!!
You got to love FDX a new raised dividend and BOFA just bought millions of shares
"another boring day, it's been doing the same since a month, why?"
"Dude, grab those shares, this was pulled back so FDX can Fly past 305.00 this week"
"Another day, still no packages, now 7 days to go from N.Y. city to north fl. If u are a investor and the company u investing in does a bad job, will effect profits."
Keep buying the dips
The dividend pay date is July 12 and everyone will be jumping back in
"Shippers have long memories and will encourage carrier entry into this space. The big cities and large shipping hubs will have lots of low price choices pushing the cost to operate higher for the large carriers. I see it in air courier, surface package, and especially in international air freight. Look up EU arriving freight to GSP!"
I just shorted UPS too and pulling it back no reason for UPS to be up so Im fighting manipulation with manipulation. Bought more FDX
"I've had nothing but good experiences with fedex. Not one late package, one damaged but resolved same hr. Will continue to use happily."
It a buy at this level. Back to $300 next week.
MY SELL ORDER IS SET FOR 450.00 AND MY HEDGE FUND SAYS EVERYONE WAS BUYING FDX THIS MORNING
Well the finish line for delivery has been changed again. 2 shipments made on Friday and both will not be delivered on original date. The pony express had more reliable service.
"Scottglad you brought that up, so true, we broke resistance 4 times in the last week and have passed the moving average and thousands of shares are being bought and BOFA has purchased millions of shares today"
Who bought more on the dip
"This horrible company has seen no increase in a month, in spite of all the pumpers who asserted that the dividend would lift the price."
FDX has just approximately 2% rally in the ER report.But FDX reaches the peak now.Comparing with the ER report on Dec 17 with 6.4% good earning but dropped 20% from the peak.I think FDX will drop tomorrow even it will beat the ER.The reason to sell is too expensive.Good Luck.
prices targets raised by 2 firms
FEDX definitely is coming along very nicely and flexing some muscles Cheers lets see 294.00 before close
So glad I loaded up today on FDX my calls are already worth over 30k
Can someone enlighten me please why am I losing money in FDX? I don’t see any major reason?

"So to all u FedEx fans out there…take a gander at your time in transit and on time. 85% on time is down there with the post office. While putting all those $$$ in Capex, you might wanna figure out what happened to your service levels. And while your at it, invest in some belts to keep your drivers pants up. Tired of looking at boxer shorts and but cracks. The franchise driver model just doesn’t bode well for quality or appearance. Yes, I am a UPS fan as quality wins."
"And the selling continues. This should end soon....ratings are to buy, hold, and price targets are much higher than it is trading. Once it reverses, then it will be swift and be up $20 before you can blink."
"Fred S - Help, we’ve fallen and can’t get up. Where is our life lock buzzer?"
FDX tailwinds:1) online retail2) reduced competition from commercial carriers due to reduced schedules3) system at holiday capacity for more than a year (another revenue upside ‘surprise’)4) pricing power with oligopoly with UPS5) opening up trade (remember when it crashed last March due to covid)…business upside6) negotiating power with aircraft manufacturers and suppliers and low capital costs 7) vaccine distribution upside with big government contracts around world8) tight global supply chain will likely mean manufacturing air ships to ensure just in time parts given bottlenecks in shipping and demand surges.9) European acquisition synergies - integration on track10) all of this and a very low PE and PEG ratio under 1!!Good luck longs….
I heard about FDX the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
300.00 !!! lets ride back to 305.00 now that I hedged and will make huge profits from these share prices
"So Jennifer buys COIN, settles for a loss. Buys FedEx, another loss. Best way to squander your money lol"
"in my in basket this afternoon:""Dear Perfect_Market,Have you noticed a sharp increase in parcel shipping rates?You’re not alone. Manufacturers, retailers, and 3PLs report serious sticker shock at the service charges carriers are tacking onto base shipping rates.Help is on the way.A Multi-Carrier Parcel Shipping System can reduce these costs by preventing the common problems that cause them.Here’s how this technology can yield dramatic cost savings:• Create blended carrier service strategies by aligning shipment history with carrier services that reduce shipping spend.• Achieve carrier-compliant shipment processing that prevents fines due to shipping errors.• Eliminate labor-intensive shipping processes such as invoice reconciliation, shipment tracking, and rate shopping.""yah, you should be scared..."
FDX just raised their dividend and the payout is July 12! FDX has a new raised target 383.00
"On Monday, at the very latest, we open up over $300 and don't look back. Could close over $300 today or Friday? :)"
"Perfectmarketwish I could, just a good friend having a beer and talking about work lol I can't tell him what to leave out just so happens he is happy he got a hefty raise too!"
"Jennifer,How many shares do you own? I see where it was around 800K in the stock. If you have that kind of money why are you on this board?"
Every trader should use (http://trademarketview.tech)! Their watchlists help me make the best possible stock picks each day. I never start a trading day without their advice!
I wasnt buying until I spoke to my investor and he seems to think FDX is going to jump today and all week says we got past our average nows it's all about green
Analysts are starting to move to “hold” recommendations on fdx. DTI trending down. Macro changes underway?
should happen pretty quick
FedEx looks better than UPShttps://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/m1AnGuQP/FDX-Revenues-How-Does-FedEx-Make-Money-
It's positive news and a Go Up
This is a good entry point. Opened new positions in two account today.
"I doubled down on $CVS so now a top holding. Like that they are gaining share in prescriptions va Amazon…..the low valuation is great and they will benefit from Covid boosters (short term) and omnichannel health care thanks to Aetna integration. I am also long $PFE and $FDX all have great momentum, ridiculously low valuation and brand/system insulation. Good luck longs."
"from one of my favorite rags:""LM: How are market conditions affecting service, and what role is the current state of the U.S. economy playing?Martinez: The shift to e-commerce throughout the pandemic has without question affected service. How carriers are dealing with this imbalance is quickly becoming a key differentiator. FedEx is all-in on e-commerce, expanding weekend services and widening its time-in-transit lead over UPS Ground Residential. Better utilization of existing assets has created capacity without huge capital expenditures. Committing to be the small- to medium-sized business (SMB) e-commerce carrier of choice, FedEx also made room in its network through high-profile breakups, most notably with Amazon.UPS is taking almost the opposite approach. Focusing aggressively on better margins, UPS is curating the volume characteristics it wants in its network, hitting many loyal customers with exorbitant rate increases to force out the undesirable volume. In 2020, UPS cancelled promised service expansions into Sunday, and crowed about expanding a Saturday Ground product that still trails FedEx’s residential delivery population coverage by roughly 30 points, with no further enhancements announced.In the wings is Amazon. The new Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) requirements took effect in February, with a second wave coming in June. By essentially requiring sellers to offer next-day service across the country, Amazon will drive business to Amazon Fulfillment and Amazon Logistics. Requiring sellers to ship six days a week puts pressure on UPS and FedEx to expand Saturday and Sunday pickups and deliveries. If the strategy works, Amazon Logistics may become the No.1 parcel shipper in the United States as early as 2022""Logistics Management 3/9/21"
"Thanks Scott I just checked Nasdaq, your absolutely right! Just placed an order for 1000 shares premarket"
They are in sell mode here and I really thought the selling was over. I am buying calls and stock.
The math adds up for 305.00 tomorrow and then a quick run to 320.00
PERFECT MARKET Are you sure you have the right picture isn't this the one you meant to share
"Always get your receipt!I used their computer station on day. The bill was $6.70. I did not print the receipt.I was billed $670.00 on my credit card and after two months, FDX hasn’t done anything for me."
"11:47 AM EDT, 06/25/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Deutsche Bank increased its price target on FedEx (FDX) to $375 from $318 following Q4 results.The brokerage said several items in fundamentals made them optimistic that the operating momentum in 2021 will continue and even accelerate in 2022.""Specifically, the company's revenue per package in its Ground business accelerated to +14.4% yoy in the most recent Q, and the company noted still about 55% of its enterprise contracts left to reprice and another increase to peak surcharges that took effect this month,"" said Deutsche Bank.The brokerage also mentioned that the $1B of incremental cost headwinds endured in 2021 is not expected to recur in 2022, which should allow more of the expected top line growth to drop to the bottom line.(MT Newswires covers equity, commodity and economic research from major banks and research firms in North America, Asia and Europe.

Not sure how many new electric trucks but I know its set to happen in a few weeks most likely and all the new hires because we know that FDX is running to 350.00 before the end of Aug
"never missed a delivery on time or early on every occasion... Great service, tad pricy but very efficient. Top 100 managed companies in the world..."
"Yeah thats great Bank of America is smart got them too, they loaded up on FDX, probably one of the firms that bought in cheaper last week. And now every firm has bought back in"
"25-june wsj article Says fdx to capex >$7B to improve capacity. Moody’s says fdx has to pay short term dept of >$2B to maintain near junk ratingStrain on cash available to operations. More debt?WSJ on fdx service “FedEx’s deliveries were 71% on time in May, unchanged from the previous month, according to the delivery-tracking software company Convey. That compares with 89% at UPS. The gap with UPS has widened since February, Convey data show.”"
$255 is the target. No change for my prediction.Even through FDX has great ER.Thank you
"FDX demand continues to be great, competitors leading price….FDX gains on continued online growth plus eventual opening up trade…..valuation will catch up with fundamentals…..believe it will be 325 by end of year. Do your own DD but FDX and PFE are my top conviction picks….good luck longs!"
I recorded around 4 wins and 0 losses in the last two weeks of negotiations. It was a great gain with Greg Maxwel. I started with the minimum amount and today I am a millionaire
"Look at ZOOM went up over $16.00 today a great example of how it doesn't matter if someone says sell or buy, sometimes they tell you to sell because they want the stock to go down and they know its worth so much, more but they don't want you to make a dime. Remember, know what you own and buy more!People aren't going to start running to stores, people love shopping online.1. People became addicted to shopping online and aren't dying to run to stores that they have to still order online at the cashier because they don't have it in stock.2. Our youth doesn't go out ( in case you haven't noticed and I know everyone sees how lazy people are)the way grandma and grandpop did and they ALL SHOP ONLINE with or without pandemics3. Everyone shops online and even the reader of this prefers shopping online"
"Washing out all the short term gamblers for earnings call. This is still a solid long term hold. If you’re chasing FedEx as the LTL Trucking play, then you’ve got that wrong.ODFL is what you want to ride in that market…"
Yeah this will be green tomorrow for sure
SHORTED UPS TIME FOR IT TO GO DOWN AND BOUGHT MORE SHARES OF FDX
Thank god this stock has a dividend
"LOL, and yes, it was another sell into the close. Wisdom states to buy, but so far buying puts has been the best thing to do. Being long has only hurt."
Solid beat coming
tomorrow will be huge for FDX
$250 is in the sight
Watch out ! the shortersThere are three tremendous today1. upgraded by Credit Suisse: to Outperform2. double earning and good guidence3. Dividend date todayI don't think these 3 factors can't bring FDX up today. Wait to see the real market open
I backed up the truck.
Another price target raised to 399.00!
Joe FDX has way more room to grow than UPS
"Jennifer,Are you trying to set a record for most posts on FDX today? You are getting close."
Looking forward to 300.00 coming faster than we know it
Buying opportunity today or Monday.
"Just curious,whats the lowest price target anyone has seen.Not your personal opinion but by a firm."
"BUY ON THIS DIP or, alternatively, keep your cash war chest in the bank earning a lacklustre return."
NKE was the stock to own.
The dividend is also a yummy. Its paid today
"Just my opinion andrewfFdx mgt failed to replace assets, from free cash flow. Then excessive maintenance cost impacted ebitda. They used free cash flow to do a stock repurchase instead. Then punted the period maintenance expenses to LT debt at junk interest rates as they purchased new assets. Think about that – mgt decides to let revenue producing asset deteriorate while investing in non-productive share buyback. In effect, shifting excessive maintenance expense to LT debt. This move made ebitda and op performance look great! Candy for the analysts! But “free cash flow available to operations” is weak. Factor in junk rated debt payments for new asset purchases which reduce asset performance. The company continues to be in a risky spot.As long as ecomm expands (will it?) and no new carriers enter (mighty high transp prices) or existing carrier capacity stays flat (more debt for fdx?) then fdx financial juggling works.ya place yah bets and takes ya chances…"
I spoke to my Hedge fund and they said FDX is going to explode tomorrow so I said Count me in!
"Just bought another 300 shares, big news coming, and with the Dividend payout we are only going up"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Hopefully I didnt get in too late
Switching to UPS due to the labor shortage and the cx satisfaction report.
Out of NKE at $150 and in FDX at $290.
"UPS ON CNBC NEXT, I will bet that the host states that it is time to buy, but that he prefers FDX."
Let’s all give a big hand to all the folks who proudly announced that they loaded up at $300 and above!
Today is going to be a great day for FDX
I guess I’m going long
Buy the dip in the morning.
BANK OF AMERICA JUST BOUGHT UP MILLIONS OF SHARES OF FEDX
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Pick-stocks.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Just drove from Princeton to Belmar NJ. Saw at least 50 Amazon delivery trucks and 6 tractor trailers.UPS and FEDEX are dead in a few years IMO.Amazon stock tanking now that people are shopping offline again. Less deliveries and Amazon now doing maximum deliveries in house - and growing exponentially every day!
JP Morgan Upgrade and top pick for transport sector. Nice.
Share price following market action. Fredx beta = 1.25. Pumpers that just bought in have dead money as this dog is sideways bound…
I heard about FDX the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
good conference call. overall things look good for 2022. $4.7 billion free cash flow. paid off 11% of debt. company is thinking of doing stock buyback in Q1. 2022 growth is expected to be 13-18% over 2021. tax rate does go up to 24%.
FDX is outpacing the Market
I’m buying more tomorrow
friday was a gift. back to the 300s. still time to get in
"Jennifer,Earnings are not out."
"Down because UPS CEO gave a bad interview on CNBC. Even Cramer thought she was too negative. Also, FDX has a much lower P/E than UPS."
"Be greedy when others are fearful - FDX is cash machine - Revenue +30%, forward price to earnings of 11 and $10B of cash and growing. They will continue to benefit from online sales and eventual return of B2B. This is a strong buy - only stock I feel better about is Pfizer (PFE)…..both will announce share buybacks with Covid windfall which will be further upside catalyst. Good luck longs."
Looks like we might see that 300.00 sooner than we think
"What to think about 15% increase in div?Fdx mgt failed to replace assets, from free cash flow. Then excessive maintenance cost impacted ebitda. They used fcf to do a stock repurchase instead. Then punted the period maintenance expenses to LT debt at junk interest rates as they purchased new assets. Think about that – mgt decides to let revenue producing asset deteriorate while investing in non-productive share buyback. Shifting maintenance expenses to LT debt made ebitda and op performance look great! But “free cash flow available to operations” is weak. Big debt payments coming up…To the mid market customer the value (service and price) is questionable. Big opportunity for new competitor or reorganized competitor (USPS) to grab market share while fdx is weak due to junk debt payments. As a matter of fact, fdx has increased competition on international and domestic products. Amazon is taking market share away from fdx daily! I’m sure the numbers will look great today but will be interesting to see this play out over time!Not sure 15% div increase is smart as the mgt thing is not so fiduciary…"
up 4 and then down 4. quess what today it?? up 4
Just bought another 200
Nothing pulling UPS up except manipulation and same here hold tight set those sell orders over 400.00 and buy the dips
All the puts that expire today will also help FDX be up another 5.00 on Monday
"Cherry picking small package carriers through automation cuts shipping costs...""Logistyx’s cloud multi-carrier shipping software sets each parcel up for successful delivery before it leaves the warehouse. Logistyx integrates with the leading business systems to seamlessly execute shipments from any operation, whether it’s automated, manual, or somewhere in between. Once each order is input, Logistyx goes to work to identify the best carrier service and automatically provides a label that complies with the carrier’s requirements.""dhl, ups, usps, fdx, etc. forced to compete. pricey carriers with poor service are automatically weeded out..."
and shorts stop selling 1 share at a time to try to make the price look like its going down hahahaha
TOMORROW WE ARE OVER 300.00
Only down $11 a share now 
I like the 14% payout ratio. There is a lot of room for dividend growth here. I will be adding to my position as this is fairly valued with good dividend growth rate.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
this is the come back week
Hey Kirk looks like your friend is deserving of the new raiseCheers to him and all the cold beers your having with him!
