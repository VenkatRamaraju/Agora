Forward PE under 12 and PEG ratio of 1 will drop further when they continue to beat earnings. Payout ratio of 15%…..Can share buybacks and divi increases be far away? They have proven they can perform during lock downs but will benefit of return to B2B……both FDX and UPS taking price which is great inflation hedge. Cash Machine!!! DYODD.
I like the 14% payout ratio. There is a lot of room for dividend growth here. I will be adding to my position as this is fairly valued with good dividend growth rate.
"Slow deliveries, lie about delivery dates will effect stock price. I never thought that ups would have good services compared to FedEx. Next time I order something I will ask that it be shipped ups or buy from somebody else."
Given tight supply chains many will expedite orders especially if products not too heavy……so they don’t run out of stock. More upside coming!!
"never missed a delivery on time or early on every occasion... Great service, tad pricy but very efficient. Top 100 managed companies in the world..."
JP Morgan Upgrade and top pick for transport sector. Nice.
Thank god this stock has a dividend
"UPS's 2Q revenue growth and updated guidance resulted in their stock going down, and consequently also resulted in the FDX stock price also being pulled down simultaneously. That shouldn't have been the case because UPS is aggressively increasing prices and chasing away Enterprise customers whereas FDX is not pursuing the same ""better, not bigger"" strategy of UPS. Whereas UPS isn't investing much CapEx to expand their brick and mortar capacity, FDX has recently significantly increased their CapEx budget to accommodate a ""better, AND biggerr"" strategy. FDX will have much higher growth than UPS in the near and mid term, and their stock price should not have been negatively impacted by UPS's guidance. FDX should be trading with a PE multiple of around 16x to 18x, whereas UPS should be trading with a multiple of only around 12x to 14x given their lower growth rates. The opposite of what we're seeing today. This is a good time to sell UPS and buy FDX. UPS's strategy of ""better, not bigger"" is only going to open the door for FDX to take share, as well as for DHL and the regional parcel carriers to expand their footprints and take share. Also look for Walmart to significantly grow their logistics asset based infrastructure, much like Amazon did, if FedEx is unable to accommodate them due to capacity constraints and the need to significantly increase prices. UPS's unionized workforce and very high cost structure, coupled with a very conservative executive management team makes it very vulnerable as new technologies emerge lowering the barriers of entry for parcel business. FDX is a bargain at the current price."
Nothing to worry about. Some institution just took profit. Gonna be buying more right now at this great price
Can someone enlighten me please why am I losing money in FDX? I don’t see any major reason?
"Fred S - Help, we’ve fallen and can’t get up. Where is our life lock buzzer?"
"Down again, down 35 last 30 days"
"So to all u FedEx fans out there…take a gander at your time in transit and on time. 85% on time is down there with the post office. While putting all those $$$ in Capex, you might wanna figure out what happened to your service levels. And while your at it, invest in some belts to keep your drivers pants up. Tired of looking at boxer shorts and but cracks. The franchise driver model just doesn’t bode well for quality or appearance. Yes, I am a UPS fan as quality wins."
"I was told that my was just part of 1% failure and that FedEx has great services 99% of the time. We'll test that. Rock auto resent the parts with estimated delivery of Aug 25 21. That is 6 days, tracking # 514577286852. I bet I do not get parts by that date. I am betting 100% failure rate. Any takers for MONEY or just for fun."
"LOL, and yes, it was another sell into the close. Wisdom states to buy, but so far buying puts has been the best thing to do. Being long has only hurt."
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
I wonder about Fedex as I simply see UPS and USPS in and around my town. I almost always use UPS and most businesses I work with do now these days as well. Is this potentially impacting Fedex moving forward?

"I was fooled again. I finally got my package from N.Y. to FL, only took 8 days. U can tell the box was repackaged and missing parts, so now I have to wait for rock auto to do an investigation and reship by FedEx. May get my parts by 2022. I think I may have found a stock that is safe to short. If u do not believe me, look up latest reviews."
"FedEx is now painting their race cars to show their support for black Americans. Really? Hard to believe that in 2021 we would have any publicly traded company in America that is targeting a select group of Americans based upon their race. As a black man, I'm sick and tired of corporations like FedEx, our government, and our media constantly teaching and brainwashing our black children to think they are inferior human beings that require special treatment, affirmative action, and government welfare in order to survive and be successful in America. Didn't we recently elect a black American to be our president....TWICE? The most powerful position in the world! The FedEx paint scheme targeting black Americans is more offensive to me than a white #$%$ who is flying the confederate flag. Both are blatant racism from my perspective. Outrageous that FedEx would adopt a marketing campaign to grow their business based upon the color of my children's skin. Blatant racism by FedEx. Disgusting."
"What has happened to FedEx? Order 2 items for N.Y. area, one shiped by FedEx and by ups. Ups item received 3 days ago. Both item's close in sizes and weight."
Every trader should use (http://trademarketview.tech)! Their watchlists help me make the best possible stock picks each day. I never start a trading day without their advice!
"Be greedy when others are fearful - FDX is cash machine - Revenue +30%, forward price to earnings of 11 and $10B of cash and growing. They will continue to benefit from online sales and eventual return of B2B. This is a strong buy - only stock I feel better about is Pfizer (PFE)…..both will announce share buybacks with Covid windfall which will be further upside catalyst. Good luck longs."
"Down down downSendle has seen tremendous growth in the past two years, and Moody said 50% of the e-commerce brands joining its platform in the past year have been new entrants to e-commerce.""It's actually quite exciting that there will be new options [beyond FedEx and UPS],"" he said. ""We're about leveling the field for the small shipper and allowing them to compete as best as they can.""Surcharges turning off shippers"
Only down $11 a share now 
"Steven p, I understand u are a stock holder and want the company to do good. I promise they are not keeping end customers happy."
I am long CVS and believe new CFO totally sandbagged assuming Covid vaccine traffic essentially stops….to me very clear that between boosters and all the vaccination mandates for business and travel this traffic will continue for months if not years. $CVS $PFE $FDX are screaming buys as they generate record cash despite low PE and PEG ratios. Good luck fellow “Strategic Value” longs!!

Well the finish line for delivery has been changed again. 2 shipments made on Friday and both will not be delivered on original date. The pony express had more reliable service.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"I doubled down on $CVS so now a top holding. Like that they are gaining share in prescriptions va Amazon…..the low valuation is great and they will benefit from Covid boosters (short term) and omnichannel health care thanks to Aetna integration. I am also long $PFE and $FDX all have great momentum, ridiculously low valuation and brand/system insulation. Good luck longs."
back over 290 this week but we need a good market
Just drove from Princeton to Belmar NJ. Saw at least 50 Amazon delivery trucks and 6 tractor trailers.UPS and FEDEX are dead in a few years IMO.Amazon stock tanking now that people are shopping offline again. Less deliveries and Amazon now doing maximum deliveries in house - and growing exponentially every day!
"I've had nothing but good experiences with fedex. Not one late package, one damaged but resolved same hr. Will continue to use happily."
"FDX is a oligopoly (UPS, AMAZON) with huge momentum (Online retail, solution for supply challenges, vaccine distribution)……with reduced competitive pressure (reduced commercial flights)…..all for a low PE. Price will follow growth trends."
This is a good entry point. Opened new positions in two account today.
Analysts are starting to move to “hold” recommendations on fdx. DTI trending down. Macro changes underway?
Just got me a great price on this one
"At FedEx, we employ more than 400,000 U.S. team members who support the economy through the movement of goods and providing related business services. For companies like us, it’s abundantly clear that America’s roads, ports, bridges, rails, and airports are severely stressed. Given these deteriorating conditions, we’re encouraged that a top focus for elected officials in Washington, D.C. is revitalizing our aging infrastructure.It’s been suggested, however, that the way to pay for these improvements is by increasing the income tax rate on corporations like FedEx. As part of this conversation, politicians and the media are misrepresenting American businesses — including ours — seeming to forget our contributions as essential drivers of the economy, innovation, and good-paying jobs.For that reason, I would like to dispel misrepresentations and omissions in media reports about FedEx and other companies related to federal income tax filings. To be clear, we pay all U.S. federal, state, and local taxes FedEx owes, which have totaled nearly $9 billion over the last five fiscal years.Let me also address directly (1) recent misrepresentations about FedEx tax filings the last few years, and (2) corporate taxes overall: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 27 March 2020 (CARES Act) which was passed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress included provisions to keep essential transportation services in operation despite a dramatic and unprecedented drop in demand for such services due to the initial surge of the COVID-19 virus — particularly in New York. The CARES Act and the subsequent Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020 resulted in over $48 billion in direct grants and $46 billion in loans to air carriers and other transportation companies and supporting businesses. It also contained several temporary tax measures to enhance financial liquidity for all businesses large and small especially essential logistics companies such as FedEx.Although FedEx was eligible for CARES Act payments and loans, we did not accept any federal funds despite several competitors doing so. Instead, we arranged for loans from the commercial market and subsequently have played a major role in keeping global health care, industrial, and at-home supply chains open. It was the combination of the CARES Act tax measures and the borrowed funds that allowed FedEx to avoid widescale furloughs during the depth of the COVID-19 challenge until our volumes recovered. Prior to the pandemic, a combination of our significantly increased investments due to the lower tax rates and capital expensing provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 (described in my Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal of 20 November 2019) resulted in a temporary reduction in our federal income tax payments over the last several years. Profits from these investments will result in tax payments to the federal government for many years in the future. The major programs and investments we made following the passage of the TCJA are detailed here. These included unscheduled pay increases for team members, contributions to further secure our well-funded U.S. employee pension plan, and major acquisitions of additional Boeing aircraft. As noted in my November 2019 Op-Ed above, the purchase of a widebody aircraft injects nearly $540 million into the U.S. economy and supports 1,850 jobs, and we ordered 24 widebody aircraft in June 2018 because of the TCJA! Please note that the corporate tax provisions in the CARES Act and TCJA are laws, not loopholes, and these provisions allow us to better serve our customers, grow our business with them, and invest in our team members’ work environment, facilities, and software especially during times of uncertainty like the COVID-19 pandemic. These investments are no different than those made by individuals, households, and parents who are affected by tax provisions focused on mortgage interest, child and dependent care, retirement savings, and education tax credits/deductions. Tax laws allow individuals/married couples/parents the ability to direct investment back into their families and households, and business tax provisions are no different.The facts about corporate tax rates:We again reiterate our strong support for the TCJA as the primary beneficiaries of increased investments by large corporations are wage earners. Former Senator Phil Gramm and Mike Solon provided clear data on these benefits in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed of 6 April 2021 including a nonpartisan estimate of economic growth of $6.2 trillion over ten years — “an extra $1,900 of annual income on average for every man, woman and child in America.” Those seeking to raise corporate taxes and discredit the benefits of the TCJA point to the large drop in corporate tax receipts as a percentage of GDP over the past three decades. What they fail to acknowledge, however, is a growing portion of the country’s business tax revenue is"
