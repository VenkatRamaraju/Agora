"For those of you who performed a discounted cash flow, today Flex had answered my question. The ""lightweight tonnage"" of their ships is 35,000. At $500/ton that yields 17.5 million scrap per ship. That is not far off an estimate I read a while ago at about $15 m/ship."

"Not sure what the need for spot LNG carriers is today.There is almost no LNG price differential across import vs export markets. The economics for arbitrage spot trading of LNG cargoes Is nonexistent.Demand has fallen, for all too many reasons. Supply has surged.Someone must blink, and shut in their production.Modern LNG carriers have little advantage over steam vessels because the boil off matters little at such low LNG prices. The cargoes have become, relative to the shipping costs, almost worthless.Spot speculators like FLNG find themselves in a bad place. Perhaps they will chose to defer their newbuilds delivers for a quarter or two?Other speculative orders of LNG carriers for 2021-2022 delivery may seek deep pocket buyers, before delivery?None of this was for seen just 12 months ago, as all the stars seemed lined up, but in fact quite the opposite has occurred."
"JF likes his stocks to pay a dividend.............Any guess when FLNG will start paying a dividend.......?? Of course, first it would be nice if they could make a profit...........by knowing JF.........who cares ?? Just pay out $$$ as long as shareholders (mainly him) profit from it."
"Futures Movers: Oil higher as dollar weakensMay 24, 2021 at 8:30 a.m. ET: By William WattsOil futures were higher Monday, with crude taking a cue from a positive tone for equities and a softer U.S. dollar, though traders continued to keep an eye on talks aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that could see Iran resume crude exports.West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL00, +1.81% CLN21, +1.81% rose 95 cents, or 1.5%, to $64.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

"For the 1Q dividend since buybacks are not limiting, I estimate a 0.30 -0.40 USD dividend. Anxiously awaiting May 28th...."
"Flex has issued a guidance of $ 80 to 90 million revenue for 1Q. Based in this I estimate earnings per share of $ 0.53 to 0.70 per share and a Free Cash Flow of $35 million to 45 million. Heck under the scenario that they break even for the rest of the year, this would lead to a forward P/E of 17 to 13 at the current price of 8.86Given the $0.30 per share dividend will cost $16 million that leaves $19 million and 29 million of FCF remaining. Since hey have more financing than needed for the remaining ship, no other obvious capitals needs, huge cash stock pile and comments that their stock price is well below NAV, I believe the remainder of FCF will go for share buybacks. At a price of $ 9.5 /share (price Wednesday) they could buy back 2 million to 3 million shares. If the share price rises to their buyback limit of $12 per share they can buy back 1.6 million to 2.4 million shares. Based on the 0.31 million shares they already bought back they will not break the 4.1 million authorized for buyback this quarter unless the price tanks. Given Flex resumed buybacks on Wednesday and with their 50,000 share purchase yesterday, to me it appears they are accelerating buyback. Their CEO even bought more stock yesterday. Even with the huge increase in revenue 3Q to 4Q, forecast 1Q revenue increase of 20-34%, tripling of dividend, large cash pile, etc the stock price has not risen. To me the reason is that this stock has not caught the eye of enough large institutions. In the last quarter the share volume on the Oslo bors ranged from 69k to 543 k shares and the NYSE of about 40k per day. At $9.5 per share a combined value of 1 million to 5.5 million traded hands daily. All we need is one institution to take a measly $20 million stake and maybe the needle will move.Any thoughts ?"

"from the earnings call, the CEO took this question about Dividend, from analyst formally Gregory Lewis.Not that the expectation in his reply is that the div should eventually be about $1.80/sh annual---------Okay. But okay Greg Miller. Yeah, the dividend. So our dividend is always, I think some companies they tend to have more like call it a structured approach to this where they either have like a minimum dividend and then they pay out 70% above that level or something like that or they say we're going to pay out 70% of earnings. For us it's – we're thinking a bit more common sense about it. We don't want to manage the dividend too much. We wanted to reflect how much money we are earning and how much money we have in surplus.So right now with the legacy of Harald's financing, we have a very good financial position. We have more money than we need in the company and at least the short-term outlook is good. So it's natural for us to increase the dividend. So it's more a question at what level should you put it. I think I held this presentation in September on the Pareto Conference because we get a lot of questions about the dividends. And people are – have been waiting for dividend, because we have been in investment mode now for about three years. And now with kind of the investment done we spent more than $20 million on CapEx last year despite having the ships financed.So how to think about the dividend? So we have $840 million of equity and this is all common equity. So there's no fancy equity here with some preference on dividends. So in order to give people a fair return you could say that you should have maybe let's say a 12% return on your equity that's the typical number analysts are putting in at least. So that means, we should be generating $100 million every year. And then is that feasible with 45,000 of cash breakeven level we certainly think that we have to generate in the mid-60s in order to be generating $100 million of cash.And then how is our financial situation it's very good. We have $130 million of cash on new revolver now putting that up to $150 million, plus of course the cash flow we generate in Q1, and we don't really have any maturities of debt we have to worry about the no bonds. And so we are able to – an aim to pay out all our earnings over the cycle. But of course, shipping is cyclical. So it's not like the numbers are very stable. This of course, depends on the business risk. We have elected to take spot exposure. So our earnings will be more volatile as a consequence of that.So then we are thinking, but if we're going to pay out $100 million which I think is fair then the dividend needs to go up to – also to more like $0.45, but of course we are dependent on the market. So we're starting here with $0.30 and which reflects around 67% of the adjusted debt, because we also have a buyback program. And we think the stock is cheap. We're paying out dividend. We hope people are reinvesting the dividends but we can't force people to spend the dividends on buybacks.So we are buying some back, but we also are mindful that we have a dominant shareholder so – with a big stake in the company. So it's not like we can buy all the stocks back. So we're doing a bit of both. I hope that, of course, the EPS or the cash flow for generation in Q1 will be substantially higher. So – but then when we were taking that decision we are in May we will have a bit more view on how the summer market will be developing how we're going into more contango structure? Are we seeing pull from Asia? Is the fiscal stimulus and the vaccines being rolled out? And where we see higher economic growth, the economic growth for this year is expected to be like 4%. So all these things will at least become more evident then.And then if we become more bullish on short-term outlook, I think the long-term outlook we are very bullish on. So if that become more evident then we always have the room to increase the dividend, but I think this is our dividend which is very sustainable at least in the shorter run. So we're trying to do a bit of both. We don't want to manage it too much but we like the dividend not to be just a factor of what you are making in one quarter, because when we're making our dividend decision we're not only looking into one quarter but a bit further ahead if that makes sense."

"GLNG just announced they locked a TFDE for 12 months at $100,000/day.I would expect FLNG to pull the trigger on their sole spot vessel for a 1-Yr charter also in coming weeks, probably at $120,000/day.They will another vessel opening to spot after Q1, and 3 on variable hires.I also expect to hear from LNG that they have exercised their option for an additional FLNG vessel.I would expect that, given current very strong rates available for FLNG, that they will se use enough revenue so support a 2022 dividend in the 0.60/quarter range."
"Why Oil Keeps Rising Even as Other Commodities Pull BackAvi Salzman: June 2, 2021 11:09 am ETPrices of commodities like steel and corn have pulled back from the highs they hit last month, but oil has continued to climb, buoyed by signs of increasing travel around the world and new pressures on supply.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were trading 0.4% higher, to $70.56 a barrel, on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.3%, to $67.94 a barrel.Oil has risen for some of the same reasons as other commodities — the speed of the reopening and supply shortages in some areas.But other factors are also at play that may prolong the oil rally even as some other commodity prices have begun to decline. Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott wrote in a note published Wednesday that political dynamics were likely to cap the growth in oil supply even as demand continues to rise in the years ahead.The International Energy Agency recently wrote that oil-and-gas companies would have to keep their capital expenditures at or below 2020 levels for the world to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. McDermott expects public company shareholders will demand that companies adhere to this rule. Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS. A) all faced reckonings last week over their climate impacts, and the pressure will only grow.Demand, however, may not drop as much as supply — though there is a robust debate going on about whether demand has already peaked or could keep rising for at least another decade.Morgan Stanley oil strategist Martjin Rats expects demand will keep rising to 107 million barrels a day by 2033, from 100 million barrels at the start of 2020. To satisfy that increasing demand, Rats expects state-owned oil companies and private firms will have to ramp up production, and oil prices will need to rise to fund that expansion. Currently, public companies account for about half of oil supply. Prices might even have to rise to $80 a barrel to induce private companies and state-owned ones to cover the gap. Rats increased his long-term Brent price target to $60 from $50.McDermott thinks that different stocks will outperform depending on oil prices. At $60 West Texas crude prices, APA, formerly Apache (APA), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Ovintiv (OVV), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Devon Energy (DVN) look attractive, he says.At $70, those stocks still look good, as do companies with more financial or operating leverage like Murphy Oil (MUR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Continental Resources (CLR).DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"If FLNG becomes, as it is well on the way to becoming, a cash-cow yield vehicle with long-term contracts and large free cash flow, it should trade at a yield like TGP. TGP has the vast majority of its fleet on long term contracts. It currently yields 8.5%.FLNG is superior to TGP in that all of its assets are the 3rd GEN carriers, while TGP still has quite a few steam vessels, many rolling off lucrative long-term charters in the coming 6-24 months. TGP has a higher debt load also, in addition to capitalization vis preferred.But if the LNG carrier market turns out as some in the industry now predict, including yesterday's CC for GLNG - who plan a spin-off of their TFDE fleet - , then the best days lie ahead for FLNG. The asset value of their fleet has risen by almost 20% this year alone as new build prices for LNGC have pushed to $210M. Its for this reason that FLNG CEO sees better value in buying their own shares, rather than expanding their fleet.Their share buyback was for up to $14/sh, with a view earlier in the year that NAV was about $16/sh. NAV is now likely closer to $20/sh, given them more room to expand the share buyback (unless they can purchases a speculative new build for less...).But their fleet free cash flow, assuming a $75,000/day charter rate and a $45,000/day breakeven after debt repay, is about $150M annually, or about $3/sh. Some analysts see X-DF rate averaging higher ($90,000 annual) as the steam class vessels adapt to new IMO emissions guidelines in 2023 by reducing speeds - since that will increase effective ton-miles. At $90,000/day average rates for their 13 vessel fleet, FLNG free cash flow becomes $4.50/sh.In either case, its not a stretch to see FLNG payout a comfortable $2/sh in dividends. At 8.5% yield (as TGP), the share price would be about $25.Note also that $25/sh is a reasonable estimate of where their NAV is likely to be before too long given the rising cost of newbuilds.By these indications, today's $13.70/sh price is very low."
"A bit puzzling to see FLNG open down our 3% most mornings now for the last 10days or so. The shares have retreated 15%, and the div yield is now approaching 13%.Also curious is that despite the large gap down most mornings of late, the shares crawl back during the day a considerable amount."
FLNG is up 9.93% to 4.09
"FLNG delivered as per its guidance. They filled a few gaps in their hires for 6 month periods at strong rates in Q3-Q4. They maintained a div, annualized of $1.60. They increased their share buyback band to $15.The stock has a sharp run up in the last week from near $13 to near $16. Maybe some were expecting a div hike, or a stronger share buyback. Those not occurring in Q2, this report is likely to disappoint the very optimistic."

Based on 45,300/day per ship break even, 95% of free cash distributed with 95% to dividend and only 5% to share buybacks, that gives $73-124 million for dividends. As far as yield, based on current pre ex div Oslo bors price of $14.8, that yields 9 - 15.5%. What do you all think ?"
"Oil Extends Gain From 2018 High With Saudis Upbeat on DemandBen Sharples: Tue, June 1, 2021, 8:37 PM(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended gains after closing at the highest since October 2018 as OPEC+ provided an upbeat assessment of the demand outlook and the prospect of a speedy return of Iranian barrels to the market waned.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said demand “has shown clear signs of improvement” as the alliance ratified an output boost for July. His Russian counterpart also spoke of the “gradual economic recovery,” with the comments driving West Texas Intermediate up by 2.1% and pushing Brent above $70 a barrel at the close for the first time since 2019.Adding further support to the market was an indication that talks to revive a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran has been delayed for now. An Iranian official said a deal is now expected to be finalized in August.Oil is up around 40% this year as the recovery from the pandemic in the U.S., China and parts of Europe boosts the outlook for fuel consumption, despite a Covid-19 resurgence in countries such as India. Global demand may rebound to levels seen before the outbreak in a year, according to the International Energy Agency, signaling a quicker comeback than its previous estimates.The prompt timespread for Brent was 41 cents in backwardation -- a bullish market structure where near-dated prices are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 9 cents at the start of last week.OPEC+ ministers agreed Tuesday to press ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June, although the group didn’t give any hints on future supply moves. There’s reason to be cautious about the second half of the year, with the outlook dependent on two hard-to-predict factors: the coronavirus and nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S.Diplomats had hoped to fully restore the nuclear deal before Iran’s June 18 presidential elections, after which the presidency of Hassan Rouhani will wind down. An agreement is expected to result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions and an increase in Iranian oil exports, although there are varying estimate on how much crude could return to the market.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"I am very bullish on Flex LNG and believe they are very undervalued. I spent a bit of time to estimate 4Q and 1Q financials as well as estimate a stock price based on dividend yield. Any thoughts ??? Here is a comment I provided on 12 Jan to J. Mintzmyer's Sept 21 Seeking Alpha Article:""Thanks for the reply. Based on your comments have completed 4Q20 and 1Q21 estimates. Given FLNG provided a TCE estimate of 70-75k for 4Q20 that estimate should be more accurate.For 4Q20, I estimate revenues at $64million, FCF $25 million and earning per share of $0.48. For the use of the FCF will assume $2 million share buyback, $11 million for dividend ($0.20 /share) and the remainder to build cash to meet estimate loan covenants of $109 million.For 1Q21 I assume: three new ships are on spot (yes I know this is optimistic but I am hopeful), fixed rate 65 K, variable at 85 K and spot of 150 k (I know you mentioned that was probably high but given recent run up in spot willbe optimistic). Based on this I estimate a TCE of $112K, revenues of $117 million, and a FCF of $70 million. For the use of this FCF I assume no share buyback as FLNG noted they will buy as long as price stays below $10/share and I assume that after the 4Q20 call the stock will be well above $10 as thus no buybacks. Since they still will take delivery of one last ship in April, I assume they may still hold on to some cash. Based on that I guess they will distribute 50% of FCF and thus estimate a dividend of $0.60 a share. I did not estimate earnings per share.As far as stock price I would heavily value it based on dividend yield. I do this because they have no indication of further investment in ships or other capital. Oeystein also mentioned that JF companies love to have high payout in dividends. Based on slide 9 from Sept 17, 2020 presentation they show a scenario of TCE of $66.5 k for 13 ships to provide earnings of $100 million and FCF of ~100 million. I will use this same approach but assume a TCE this year of $85 K. Based on this FCF would be $190 million. Assume no further buybacks an 80% distribution to dividend would provide $3.5/share for the year. Further assume folks want a 10% yield that would translate to a stock price of ($3.5 per share /0.10) = $35 /share. There are many assumptions and hope to be even close. """

"I think that Flex is riding on the $TGP buy-out coattails. TGP was my 2nd biggest holding so now with the buyout, I started looking at alternatives. Flex is not as good of a deal as TGP was, IMO. The estimated ""DCF"" or FCF payout looks maxed out at 75%. Oddly only the last 6 months has really brought in a lot of earnings for them, maybe the strong LNG market. Much more of debt and adding every quarter. EBTIDA / EV and net debt is higher than I like. Book value isn't too bad though at 1.25x.Not very exciting for me. :("

"I would expect the FLEX Volunteer, now in spot, and the FLEX Resolute, rolling off contract after Q4, to be locked into 12-36 month charters.If so, and assuming Chenniere takes the 5th Flex vessel, would secure 9 on long term contracts, the remaining on variable rate longer charters.If they earn $75,000/day, each vessel generates $10M annual free cash flow, after operating cost and debt reduction. Debt reduction is at a pace of about $80-$90M per year.So their fleet of 13 vessels would generate $130M FCF, almost $3/sh. All the while their debt reduction is equivalent to increasing equity by $2/sh.If they lock those additional charters (current 1-Yr charters for modern TFDE are $95K/day), expect dividend to be increased to at least $2/sh annualized, a current yield of 15%."

If FLNG can payout $1.20/sh annually, at a 7.5% yield would imply $16/sh.CEO has talked about a plausible payout capacity in the range of $1.50 to $1.80/sh, assuming they secured $70K/day rates across their fleet of 13 MEGI/XDF 3rd GEN vessels. That is new for below what the current market is - which of course is volatile.

What do you all think about Avance Gas Holding Ltd (AVACF) ? They are another company under JF's control and Flex's CEO has recently been added as a board member. I understand they ship LPG but ask you all since FLNG's CEO is on the board and I respect many of your analysis/opinions. I have done only a little research and opened a very small position.
I think FLNG is a sell. Rough back of envelop calculations imply a 10.5x EV/EBITDA (2022) valuation and NAV of $200m/vessel. How much more upside do you guys expect? GLOP is trading a full 2-3 turns lower.
Just sold half my position before seeing the news about the long term charters with Cheniere. Don't know what kind of rates.
"Tradewinds reports today that spot modelers LNGC rates are 6-figures on some legs. While FLNG now has secured 88% of their fleet days in 2021, besides the one vessel on spot (Volunteer), three are on market indexed contracts (Artemis, Enterprise, and Amber). In the company's May 2021 presentation, they gave revenue guidance for Q3 and Q4 that had median estimates of $80M and $90M, respectively. The upper end range of those was about $90M, and $100M, respectively - which reflected the leverage to spot rates via their index linked charters.They have upto three vessels that will begin new 3-5 yr charters in FY2022, and these are all at higher rates than their current expiring charters. Also, the Resolute comes off hire in Q12022, while both Amber and Enterprise variable charters come to an end, and the charterer has options. It is likely that 2022 revenues will thus be above the Q4 run rate, and may well exceed $450M. Bottom line is that whereas Q12021 saw $81M in revenues, after a very strong spot market in winter 2020/21, their fully deliver fleet, with lucrative longer charters in hand imply $100M+ quarterly revenuesin 2022 and several yrs beyond. it is quite plausible that FLNG dividend will rise again in late 2021, and 2022 to a payout of $2.00-$2.50/shTo the extend their earnings visibility and backlog grows, their share price should adjust to $25/sh or so based on their payout capacity."

"Why FLNG assets sit in the sweet spot of the LNG mid-stream chain today:____________LNG shipping outlook bullish as oversupply risk dropsin International Shipping News 10/07/2021Higher prompt LNG shipping rates are breaking seasonal patterns, signaling a tighter market over the next year, say shipowners.The bullishness comes despite minimal new liquefaction in 2022 and the arrival of over 30 new modern vessels. (LONG-TERM TRANSPORT CONTRACT ROLLOVERS IN 2022 USING STEAM WILL BE REPLACED WITH MEGI/XDF CLASS VESSELS, NOT RENEWED WITH THE OLDER AND MUCH MORE POLLUTING OLDER VESSELS)Spot rates for TDFE/DFDE and MEGI/XDF (Two-Stroke) vessels have overtaken long term rates, which is an unusual pattern for summer.The shift has been linked largely to high European gas prices and ongoing demand from Asia.The fleet balance and a strong re-let market are also key.FLEET BALANCEAbout 32 modern newbuildings (MEGI/XDF and TDFE/DFDE) will be delivered in 2022 to shipowners.About 50-55 newbuildings hit the water 2021, but liquefaction capacity also increased keeping the shipping market long overall, which is not the case for next year.“You would expect a long [LNG shipping] market [in 2022],” said a shipping analyst. “But the opposite is the case.” (I.E. THERE ARNET ENOUGH AVAIABLE VESSLES TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR LONG-HAUL AND CARBON NEUTRAL TRANSPORT0RE-LET FLEETAlmost all modern LNG carriers are let for multi-month or annual charters as traders seek to sell in a higher price environment.A re-let market can exacerbate spot tightness, but the speed with which spot rates rose still surprised some.The jump was a surprise, “given how many newbuilds were being fixed ex-yard [this year], at around $65,000-$70,000/day for term business”, said a shipping source on the switch from normal patterns.Traders and portfolio players looking at near-term optimisation are not keen to sublet for fear of not having tonnage when opportunities materialise.US RISE“I attribute it to the need for extra tonnage to go from US Gulf of Mexico to Asia via Cape of Good Hope and the Mediterranean (Suez Canal),” the shipping source added. (I.E. TON MILE EXPANSION)The US has seen record export levels this year, and Atlantic tonnage particularly tight due to vessels still positioning in Asia.Nevertheless Asia traders such as JERA, DGI and PetroChina have all taken Atlantic positions, said sources. Low inventories in Asia and Europe mean restocking into winter, while carbon could remain a bullish factor for gas prices.With more demand from Latin America as well, said the source “we have something of a shortage”. In the summer of 2020 Asian traders were trying to dispose of excess cargoes.RISING MARKET“At the moment, high LNG prices mean you can compensate freight rates with trading options,” said a trading source. (the HIGHER THE LNG PRICE, THE GREATR DIFFERENTIAL IN ECONOMICS OF MEGI VE TFDE/STEAM CARRIERS; LEADING TO GROWING CHARTER PREMIMUMS FOR THE MEGI-CLASS)Given that most of the market is now controlled by charterers “it is likely [they] are comfortable with rates”, said another shipping source.Two-stroke (MEGI/XDF) vessel rates are being negotiated for one year at around $100,000-$120,000/day, said a shipping source on 6 July. Such levels would be comfortably above breakeven for shippers.Two stroke vessels command a premium. Although TFDE/DFDE and steam-propulsion remain part of the global fleet, the “emphasis on decarbonisation places more of a premium on two-strokes so I could easily envisage further strength in that sector and a softening in the TFDE class”, said a shipowner. (MEGI CLASS VESSELS MORE EASILY PERMITS FOR CARBON-NEUTRAL SHIPPMENTS - THE LATEEST DIFFERENTION OF LNG PRODUCERS AND SUPPLIERS)For owners, price spreads are key. In the short term, “we are more focused on the spread between Europe and Asia”, said another owner, explaining that it has narrowed due to strong European demand pushing Asia LNG prices.Widening prices would further stimulate the market, due to longer distances boosting existing shipping demand.Source: ICIS, Clare Pennington, https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2021/07/08/10661194/lng-shipping-outlook-bullish-as-oversupply-risk-drops"

I added FLNG to my collection of GLNG. anyone else doing both?
"FLNG now has 12 of its modern LNGC on the water. Their last delivery is for Q22021.FLNG has the largest leverage to spot rates. Even if their 12 vessels were to earn $75K/day (close to guidance for Q22020, but far below what is likely to be the case for Q12021), their free cash flow (before taxes; after all operating and finance costs) is about $300K/day for the 12-vessel fleet. Thats about $30M in a quarter, or $120M annualized. That implies a free cash flow yield at their current price of about 20%.FLNG has made it clear that they will be distributing most of their free cash in the form of dividends, and when shares are below $10/sh, a $20M share buyback. I would expect them to increase the div form the recent 0.10/sh to about 0.15 - 0.20/sh for Q4, and sustained going forward thru 2021."

"Best management in shipping space in my opinion! When I invest I’m looking for integrity in management decisions over time also I pay attention to general and administrative expenses and stock compensations and $FLNG is not only the best management it also the most efficient in saving money. $FLNG became my larger position by farI little bit concern about high leverage and personally I would deleverage first instead of paying high dividends and buyback.Deleveraging increase book value per share exactly as buyback but also brings down breakeven that is extremely important when freight rates are at bottom. Just look how good performs low leveraged $DHT during extremely low rates when others report heavy loses.Also repaying debt decrease interest expenses and increase net income in $FLNG case 74M$ may go to shareholders instead of banks, it almost doubles net returns. I understand that repaying 100% of debt is unrealistic just because companies in the space don’t do that ;) but I still prefer something like 50% of net income to deleveraging when market is good."

"I thought I would share two insights from the 2020 Annual Report and one from an article on Linked In.First for 2021 Flex LNG already has a Minimum Committed revenue (page F-28) of 95.1 million. This represents ""only the floor rate per the contracts.."". This is very encouraging as I calculate the approximate cash breakeven for the year at 13 Ships x 45K/day/ship x 365 days = 213 million. They have already committed about 44% of their cash breakeven for the year.Second I calculated the floor on the fixed portion of Variable hire on three of their ships. For the Variable Hire Flex Artemis, I calculated 40K per day for the fixed portion. This was based on page F-28 of the annual report which shows Minimum Committed Revenue for 2023 and 2024 of 14.6 million each year. The only ship on contract those years is the Flex Artemis and given the Revenue is the same each year it further supports the theory. Also in 2025 the minimum revenue is 9.1 which is also consistent with this day rate give the contract is not a full year and is over in August 2025.In 2022 there are three ships on contract for a minimum revenue of 19.2 million. After I subtract the 14.6 for Flex Artemis that leaves 4.6 for the Flex Rainbow which is a fixed only contract expiring in January and the variable hire Flex Enterprise which is off contact in March. I tried splitting the revenue evenly over these two ships but the numbers didn't support the rate of Flex Rainbow which is Fixed only. I therefore assumed the Flex Rainbow expired early January leaving the funds for Flex Enterprise. Based on this assumption I calculate a fixed portion of Flex Enterprise's variable hire at 50K per day.On LinkedIn I also caught glimpse of the Qatar tender for LNG carriers for their LNG expansion and to replace carriers coming off contract. To me this is very bullish, especially for new carriers the like if which makes up FLNG's fleet.Please let me know your thoughts. Joe"

"Excellent Podcast with CEO and Seeking Alpha posted 17 Dec.They will payout most of their cash flow as dividends, to Boards discretion.Their Q3 cash flow from operating were $8M, and they paid 0.10/sh on 50M shares .outstanding.Their Q4 cash flow from operations should by about $30-$35M. That gives the lots of room for their Q4 div to exceed Q3. My hunch is that they will pay about 0.25-0.30/sh div for Q4.The spot rates are holding, with X-DF rates at the $100K/day rate still. I look for their Q12020 revenue guidance to be close to Q42019, leaving another quarter of 0.25-0.30/sh payout.The story gets better in late 2020 when they deliver 5 additional vessels. And 2 more in early 2021.While rates fluctuate, and we currently are near a seasonal high, it should be clear that FLNG can generate lots of free cash. CEO said they will pay that to the shareholders. Although their shares are trading below their NAV, the CEO said they will not do share repurchase, but distribute their cash flow to the shareholders, and let them decide what to do with cash.Given the SFL and FRO history of strong payout, I think the same will develop here for FLNG, and it is conceivable that with 13 vessels on the water by mid-2021, a prudent mix of long term charters plus spot could yield a fairly steady payout of $2/sh (of course, reducing when charter rates are lower...).The market will favor the new modern vessels of FLNG fleet for their remarkably small environmental footprint. Expect that IMO2020 will lead to IMO2025 for methane emissions, lining up their fleet as already compliant. The environmental cost of the old steam fleet will increasingly be a problem for their utilization, as the CEO discusses. There is a huge gap between the functionality and environmental attributes of their new fleet compared to the existing vast majority of LNG vessels. Only GLOG has a similar high quality fleet of new vessels (though also a fare share of the TFDE).If the div indeed rises as seems likely, I expect that the shares will rise to a 6-8% yield, or $15 to $20 over the next 6months."

"Conference call worth a listen. Especially interesting is the CEO discussionof what it would cost today to create a FLNG company of 13 MEGI vessels, and thus the implied NAV. The upshot is that NAV is likely at least $20 and arguable $25 at this time. The fact that shares are trading at about 60%-70% of NAV despite their great revenue visibility is a puzzle, and rather unwarranted. This disparity will likely become more evident in Q3 and Q4 when they project record income, and state that div capacity to grow is there in 2H. They also indicated that their cash balance of $144M is considerable more than what they need on hand, and will find a way to return to shareholders.Bottom line - expect the annual run rate div to be near $2.00/sh by yr end. A rational share price at year end would be low to mid 20s, giving a yield of 8% to 10% range."

"I have estimated of the ""Net Asset Value"" of Flex's Fleet two ways. The first, book equity per share, yields $15.5/share and the second, a vessel market evaluation, yields about $18/shareHere are the details for both estimates. First we can take the balance sheet equity ($835m) and divided by shares (54M) to get a value of $15.5/ share. This is only the accounting value and the cost of new builds is different since purchase. Since there is no impairment, the cost of new builds increased, and they are only about 1 yr old so this should represent an undervaluation of the company.Second we can determine the approximate cost of fleet today, subtract out liabilities (after all 13 ships are delivered) and divided by the number of shares to arrive at a ""market"" value of the fleet. To this number I would also add cash - minus other liabilities to arrive at a final value.To this end Fearnley's reported this week a purchase price of $191 M/ship (we paid about 187m). I would add to this the cost of $5.8 m for loan fees and $2.8 M for change orders, pre delivery crew exp, fit out, studies etc. These later two numbers came from FLNG's 4Q report/20-F. This brings the total outlay of $199.6 M per ship. For a fleet of 13 that would total to $ 2,594 M. From this subtract out estimated debt of $1,676M to get $918M of ""market"" equity. This yields $17/share ($918M/54M shares). Add to this $17 about $1/share of cash after balance sheet expenses to bring the total to about $18/share. If Jeremy Siegel is correct and we we see 20% inflation per year over the next two years and if we can pass on costs to customers, our asset value will explode !Previously, I estimated the stock price of $20-$30/share based on dividend yield and from a discounted cash flow $12 ($65k/day, 15% discount) to $30 ($75k/day, 8% discount). Based on all the above I would feel comfortable to buy more at today's market price of $12 and would not consider selling my shares until the stock price reaches the upper $20s. I have high hopes that over the next few years the TCE will average over $75k/day and therefore will expect a price of $30-35/share. I am this confident as coal is on the way out, older steam LNGC will get scrapped, vessels and land vehicles are switching to LNG and the fleet and order book are matched to current demand. Joe"

"FLNG, as announced this afternoon, signed time charter contracts for 4 of their LNGC with Cheniere Energy. Period is 3 yrs, with options for 2 additional yrs. Also, they have an option to provide a 5th LNGC to them for long hire. All vessels are existing fleet, including the soon to be delivered newbuild. No rates were announced, but I would assume something in the 80K/day range is plausible.This is a big strategic move, and with a major LNG producer. Their cash flow visibility has just been greatly increased, and while they will continue to have flexibility with most of their remaining vessels as to capitalize on markets, this deal alone is likely to ensure a significant, minimum distribution.Let’s assume they end up securing 5 vessels with Chenierre. Given their cash break even of $43K/day, each vessel would generate $15M in annual free cash flow, or an aggregate of $75M annually for the 5 vessels. That alone is about $1.40/sh.You can do the math and assumptions for the other 8 vessels, but the cash generation potential is huge."

"From SA 7 January 2020Valuation is attractiveWith LNGC day rates less strong than expected at the start of the year, LNG stocks have derated significantly, and FLEX was down -26% in 2019. This has resulted in an attractive entry point in a name that offers substantial asset backing and a high probability of significant income generation. FLEX is currently trading at a P/NAV of 0.7x and EV/GAV of 0.9x. Using US$185M per vessel results in an estimated Gross Asset Value of US$2.4Bn. Deducing net liabilities including future capex results in an NAV of US$787M. The company's current market cap is US$560M.The exhibit below shows the FCF per vessel based on various day rates provided by the company. While the high end of the day rates provided are unlikely to be achieved, using a US$75k/day rate would imply an FCF yield of 25% once its entire fleet is delivered. The 6 vessels it has currently trading this year would generate an FCF yield of 11-12% on current market cap using a US$75k/day rate. The potential FCF generation offers substantial capacity for the pay-out of dividends. Thus, we see FLEX at current levels being supported by a strong asset backing and significant income potential in the form of dividends. Potential for stock to trade up to US$14.6 vs. the current US$10.3 or in line with NAV once the company starts paying more significant dividends and enters into long term TC at attractive rates. The company initiated its first dividend payment in 3Q19 (10 cents or approx. 1%), and we expect this to be increased gradually as earnings increase.The Fredriksen Group is the majority shareholder with a 44.6% stake. FLEX benefits from technical management and shared services from the Fredriksen group which keeps costs low. It has also helped for attractive financing terms."
"The important aspect of today's Q2 report is that the rolloff of Steam LNGC from long term contracts will create opprtunities for the MEGi-type vessels to replace the older tonnage in contract renewal. The TCE equivalent, for identical end shipped cost of LNG is $75K/day for MEGi vs $30K/day for Steam. However, at $30K/day rates, an owner of the steam carrier is not making a profit (assuming they still carry debt), whereas the break-even level for the MEGi is about $50K/day, all cost inclusive.The point here is that the Steam vessels will have a hard time competing for long term contracts going forward, and that the indications from the order book of too much tonnage after 2021 fails to appreciate that few charterers will be interested to returning to the old, inefficient vessels."

"FLNG shares likely to gradually churn higher to a yield of about 8% - a share price of $20/sh.By comparison, TGP is trading at a div yield of 7.5% today.It will take a bit for large funds to begin moving their attention to FLNG, but as the next several quarters of payout are seen, and as management reaffirms their ability to payout considerably more (i.e. div growth from the current $1.60 annualized to above $2/sh annualized) as LNGC markets strengthen in 2023 and beyond, the shares could be pushing even above $25/sh in the 12-18 month frame.All-in-all, a 1-yr total return of 40%, and a 2-yr total return of over 60% is quite possible."
"Brent nudges towards $70 on rosy U.S. data, oil demand outlookThu, May 27, 2021, 9:33 PM: By Florence TanSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices pushed higher on Friday, supported by firm U.S. economic data and expectations of a strong rebound in global fuel demand in the third quarter, while concerns eased about the impact of any return of Iranian supplies.Brent crude futures for July gained 16 cents, 0.2%, to $69.62 a barrel by 0050 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $67.17 a barrel, up 32 cents, or 0.5%.""Oil headed higher on robust U.S. economic data and growing sentiment that if the Iran nuclear deal is revived, it will not include an immediate removal of sanctions and that the oil market will not get quickly flooded with excess supplies,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said in a note.Brent and WTI are both on track to post weekly gains of 5% to 6% as analysts expect global oil demand to rebound closer to 100 million barrels per day in the third quarter on summer travel in Europe and the United States following widespread COVID-19 vaccination programmes.Robust economic data from the United States, the world's largest economy and oil consumer, also buoyed risk appetite.
