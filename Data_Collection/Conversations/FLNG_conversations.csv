"If FLNG becomes, as it is well on the way to becoming, a cash-cow yield vehicle with long-term contracts and large free cash flow, it should trade at a yield like TGP. TGP has the vast majority of its fleet on long term contracts. It currently yields 8.5%.FLNG is superior to TGP in that all of its assets are the 3rd GEN carriers, while TGP still has quite a few steam vessels, many rolling off lucrative long-term charters in the coming 6-24 months. TGP has a higher debt load also, in addition to capitalization vis preferred.But if the LNG carrier market turns out as some in the industry now predict, including yesterday's CC for GLNG - who plan a spin-off of their TFDE fleet - , then the best days lie ahead for FLNG. The asset value of their fleet has risen by almost 20% this year alone as new build prices for LNGC have pushed to $210M. Its for this reason that FLNG CEO sees better value in buying their own shares, rather than expanding their fleet.Their share buyback was for up to $14/sh, with a view earlier in the year that NAV was about $16/sh. NAV is now likely closer to $20/sh, given them more room to expand the share buyback (unless they can purchases a speculative new build for less...).But their fleet free cash flow, assuming a $75,000/day charter rate and a $45,000/day breakeven after debt repay, is about $150M annually, or about $3/sh. Some analysts see X-DF rate averaging higher ($90,000 annual) as the steam class vessels adapt to new IMO emissions guidelines in 2023 by reducing speeds - since that will increase effective ton-miles. At $90,000/day average rates for their 13 vessel fleet, FLNG free cash flow becomes $4.50/sh.In either case, its not a stretch to see FLNG payout a comfortable $2/sh in dividends. At 8.5% yield (as TGP), the share price would be about $25.Note also that $25/sh is a reasonable estimate of where their NAV is likely to be before too long given the rising cost of newbuilds.By these indications, today's $13.70/sh price is very low."
Would you buy now or wait till after earnings on Tuesday?
":D lol ... -8,8% .. what peaple expect ? rising dividend on 1 usd ?"
I think FLNG is a sell. Rough back of envelop calculations imply a 10.5x EV/EBITDA (2022) valuation and NAV of $200m/vessel. How much more upside do you guys expect? GLOP is trading a full 2-3 turns lower.

"Brent nudges towards $70 on rosy U.S. data, oil demand outlookThu, May 27, 2021, 9:33 PM: By Florence TanSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices pushed higher on Friday, supported by firm U.S. economic data and expectations of a strong rebound in global fuel demand in the third quarter, while concerns eased about the impact of any return of Iranian supplies.Brent crude futures for July gained 16 cents, 0.2%, to $69.62 a barrel by 0050 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at $67.17 a barrel, up 32 cents, or 0.5%.""Oil headed higher on robust U.S. economic data and growing sentiment that if the Iran nuclear deal is revived, it will not include an immediate removal of sanctions and that the oil market will not get quickly flooded with excess supplies,"" OANDA analyst Edward Moya said in a note.Brent and WTI are both on track to post weekly gains of 5% to 6% as analysts expect global oil demand to rebound closer to 100 million barrels per day in the third quarter on summer travel in Europe and the United States following widespread COVID-19 vaccination programmes.Robust economic data from the United States, the world's largest economy and oil consumer, also buoyed risk appetite. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest since mid-March 2020, beating estimates.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"

"Why Oil Keeps Rising Even as Other Commodities Pull BackAvi Salzman: June 2, 2021 11:09 am ETPrices of commodities like steel and corn have pulled back from the highs they hit last month, but oil has continued to climb, buoyed by signs of increasing travel around the world and new pressures on supply.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, were trading 0.4% higher, to $70.56 a barrel, on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate futures were up 0.3%, to $67.94 a barrel.Oil has risen for some of the same reasons as other commodities — the speed of the reopening and supply shortages in some areas.But other factors are also at play that may prolong the oil rally even as some other commodity prices have begun to decline. Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott wrote in a note published Wednesday that political dynamics were likely to cap the growth in oil supply even as demand continues to rise in the years ahead.The International Energy Agency recently wrote that oil-and-gas companies would have to keep their capital expenditures at or below 2020 levels for the world to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. McDermott expects public company shareholders will demand that companies adhere to this rule. Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS. A) all faced reckonings last week over their climate impacts, and the pressure will only grow.Demand, however, may not drop as much as supply — though there is a robust debate going on about whether demand has already peaked or could keep rising for at least another decade.Morgan Stanley oil strategist Martjin Rats expects demand will keep rising to 107 million barrels a day by 2033, from 100 million barrels at the start of 2020. To satisfy that increasing demand, Rats expects state-owned oil companies and private firms will have to ramp up production, and oil prices will need to rise to fund that expansion. Currently, public companies account for about half of oil supply. Prices might even have to rise to $80 a barrel to induce private companies and state-owned ones to cover the gap. Rats increased his long-term Brent price target to $60 from $50.McDermott thinks that different stocks will outperform depending on oil prices. At $60 West Texas crude prices, APA, formerly Apache (APA), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Ovintiv (OVV), ConocoPhillips (COP), and Devon Energy (DVN) look attractive, he says.At $70, those stocks still look good, as do companies with more financial or operating leverage like Murphy Oil (MUR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Continental Resources (CLR).DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"
"Upside vs. downside is not interesting in FLNG. Best is to start gradually selling down periodically and perhaps keeping a core amount in case it, for some momentary reason, goes upward further. But I think it's a sell."
"FLNG delivered as per its guidance. They filled a few gaps in their hires for 6 month periods at strong rates in Q3-Q4. They maintained a div, annualized of $1.60. They increased their share buyback band to $15.The stock has a sharp run up in the last week from near $13 to near $16. Maybe some were expecting a div hike, or a stronger share buyback. Those not occurring in Q2, this report is likely to disappoint the very optimistic."
"Shipping sector again managed to escape corporate tax“ 130 countries back global minimum corporate tax of 15% . The new minimum tax rate of at least 15% would apply to companies with turnover above a 750-million-euro ($889-million)threshold, with only the shipping industry exempted” $FLNG, $DLNG, $TGP $LPG $CMRE $NMM $DAC $DHT"
"Best management in shipping space in my opinion! When I invest I’m looking for integrity in management decisions over time also I pay attention to general and administrative expenses and stock compensations and $FLNG is not only the best management it also the most efficient in saving money. $FLNG became my larger position by farI little bit concern about high leverage and personally I would deleverage first instead of paying high dividends and buyback.Deleveraging increase book value per share exactly as buyback but also brings down breakeven that is extremely important when freight rates are at bottom. Just look how good performs low leveraged $DHT during extremely low rates when others report heavy loses.Also repaying debt decrease interest expenses and increase net income in $FLNG case 74M$ may go to shareholders instead of banks, it almost doubles net returns. I understand that repaying 100% of debt is unrealistic just because companies in the space don’t do that ;) but I still prefer something like 50% of net income to deleveraging when market is good."
"Fernleys reported today that TDFE-class spot at $190,000/day on west -bound and east-bound routes.The equivalent for MEGI-class is likely about $220,000/day - $240,000/dayWith FLNG having the only MEGI available in spot, and 3 indexed to the spot rates, this is quite a boon for them!"

"Futures Movers: Oil higher as dollar weakensMay 24, 2021 at 8:30 a.m. ET: By William WattsOil futures were higher Monday, with crude taking a cue from a positive tone for equities and a softer U.S. dollar, though traders continued to keep an eye on talks aimed at reviving a nuclear deal that could see Iran resume crude exports.West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL00, +1.81% CLN21, +1.81% rose 95 cents, or 1.5%, to $64.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

"I think that Flex is riding on the $TGP buy-out coattails. TGP was my 2nd biggest holding so now with the buyout, I started looking at alternatives. Flex is not as good of a deal as TGP was, IMO. The estimated ""DCF"" or FCF payout looks maxed out at 75%. Oddly only the last 6 months has really brought in a lot of earnings for them, maybe the strong LNG market. Much more of debt and adding every quarter. EBTIDA / EV and net debt is higher than I like. Book value isn't too bad though at 1.25x.Not very exciting for me. :("
"3 biggest $ETC-USD transactions in Oct were buys. Things are looking up for Ethereum Classic to close the gap up to $ETH-USD. $NRGU, $RIOT, $REML. $AR, $AM, $FLNG, $TMV, $SLVO"
Take your FLNG profits and roll into GLNG for even more gains over the next 6-12 months. FLNG has maxed out.
"I have estimated of the ""Net Asset Value"" of Flex's Fleet two ways. The first, book equity per share, yields $15.5/share and the second, a vessel market evaluation, yields about $18/shareHere are the details for both estimates. First we can take the balance sheet equity ($835m) and divided by shares (54M) to get a value of $15.5/ share. This is only the accounting value and the cost of new builds is different since purchase. Since there is no impairment, the cost of new builds increased, and they are only about 1 yr old so this should represent an undervaluation of the company.Second we can determine the approximate cost of fleet today, subtract out liabilities (after all 13 ships are delivered) and divided by the number of shares to arrive at a ""market"" value of the fleet. To this number I would also add cash - minus other liabilities to arrive at a final value.To this end Fearnley's reported this week a purchase price of $191 M/ship (we paid about 187m). I would add to this the cost of $5.8 m for loan fees and $2.8 M for change orders, pre delivery crew exp, fit out, studies etc. These later two numbers came from FLNG's 4Q report/20-F. This brings the total outlay of $199.6 M per ship. For a fleet of 13 that would total to $ 2,594 M. From this subtract out estimated debt of $1,676M to get $918M of ""market"" equity. This yields $17/share ($918M/54M shares). Add to this $17 about $1/share of cash after balance sheet expenses to bring the total to about $18/share. If Jeremy Siegel is correct and we we see 20% inflation per year over the next two years and if we can pass on costs to customers, our asset value will explode !Previously, I estimated the stock price of $20-$30/share based on dividend yield and from a discounted cash flow $12 ($65k/day, 15% discount) to $30 ($75k/day, 8% discount). Based on all the above I would feel comfortable to buy more at today's market price of $12 and would not consider selling my shares until the stock price reaches the upper $20s. I have high hopes that over the next few years the TCE will average over $75k/day and therefore will expect a price of $30-35/share. I am this confident as coal is on the way out, older steam LNGC will get scrapped, vessels and land vehicles are switching to LNG and the fleet and order book are matched to current demand. Joe"
FLEX posted a trade at $21.00 (US) in after hours trading. Maybe a little late to be buying FLEX but take a look at another sister company in the JF Group - Golden Ocean (GOGL). Currently trading at a little over $10.00 (US) with a good dividend. The company is selling older ships for more efficient new ships using funds from the sale of older ships and cash on hand. Outlook very favorable and the management appears to be in the same mold as FLEX. I have done very well with FLEX so I started a new position in GOGL to see if I can obtain similar results. Do your own DD.....
"It appears that MEG/XDF ships of 174 cbm premiums over TFDE ships have increase to $40 K/day. This is another great piece of information for those tracking the LNGc shipping market. For reference please see 5 day old quote from Flex's CEO:""We have for some time said, highlight spot rates for MEGI/XDF doesn’t fully reflect the bigger cargo sizes and significant fuel savings given the high cargo prices or cost of boil off, Spark Commodities here assessing this premium to about $40,000 per day which seems more reasonable than the $20-25,000 often quoted."""

"Oil Extends Gain From 2018 High With Saudis Upbeat on DemandBen Sharples: Tue, June 1, 2021, 8:37 PM(Bloomberg) -- Oil extended gains after closing at the highest since October 2018 as OPEC+ provided an upbeat assessment of the demand outlook and the prospect of a speedy return of Iranian barrels to the market waned.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said demand “has shown clear signs of improvement” as the alliance ratified an output boost for July. His Russian counterpart also spoke of the “gradual economic recovery,” with the comments driving West Texas Intermediate up by 2.1% and pushing Brent above $70 a barrel at the close for the first time since 2019.Adding further support to the market was an indication that talks to revive a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran has been delayed for now. An Iranian official said a deal is now expected to be finalized in August.Oil is up around 40% this year as the recovery from the pandemic in the U.S., China and parts of Europe boosts the outlook for fuel consumption, despite a Covid-19 resurgence in countries such as India. Global demand may rebound to levels seen before the outbreak in a year, according to the International Energy Agency, signaling a quicker comeback than its previous estimates.The prompt timespread for Brent was 41 cents in backwardation -- a bullish market structure where near-dated prices are more expensive than later-dated ones. That compares with 9 cents at the start of last week.OPEC+ ministers agreed Tuesday to press ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June, although the group didn’t give any hints on future supply moves. There’s reason to be cautious about the second half of the year, with the outlook dependent on two hard-to-predict factors: the coronavirus and nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S.Diplomats had hoped to fully restore the nuclear deal before Iran’s June 18 presidential elections, after which the presidency of Hassan Rouhani will wind down. An agreement is expected to result in a lifting of U.S. sanctions and an increase in Iranian oil exports, although there are varying estimate on how much crude could return to the market.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA"
"Conference call worth a listen. Especially interesting is the CEO discussionof what it would cost today to create a FLNG company of 13 MEGI vessels, and thus the implied NAV. The upshot is that NAV is likely at least $20 and arguable $25 at this time. The fact that shares are trading at about 60%-70% of NAV despite their great revenue visibility is a puzzle, and rather unwarranted. This disparity will likely become more evident in Q3 and Q4 when they project record income, and state that div capacity to grow is there in 2H. They also indicated that their cash balance of $144M is considerable more than what they need on hand, and will find a way to return to shareholders.Bottom line - expect the annual run rate div to be near $2.00/sh by yr end. A rational share price at year end would be low to mid 20s, giving a yield of 8% to 10% range."
"2 positive points re FLNG; the POR is only 31% & insiders own 52%, 2 very positive points"
"GLNG just announced they locked a TFDE for 12 months at $100,000/day.I would expect FLNG to pull the trigger on their sole spot vessel for a 1-Yr charter also in coming weeks, probably at $120,000/day.They will another vessel opening to spot after Q1, and 3 on variable hires.I also expect to hear from LNG that they have exercised their option for an additional FLNG vessel.I would expect that, given current very strong rates available for FLNG, that they will se use enough revenue so support a 2022 dividend in the 0.60/quarter range."
