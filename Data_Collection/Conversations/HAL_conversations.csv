Heading down. I'll buy in at $22
This stock/group is a no brainer. Buy on dips and sit back. Early innings on this one.
"Poor, Not a good report at all. Back to $22's...too bad even after oil rally..."
There's so far you can go with 0.7% dividend yield in the oil sector.
"finally I can breathe, was holding this for the past 2 years, so a little profit in sight."
HAL reached a 52 Week high at 26.34
"Found me a beauty to short 10,000 shares at $25.28, up to fast in 3 days from $22.50 to $25.31 ?? This baby is coming down very soon."
"ER talked about the start of an upcycle lasting these next couple years. Quarter to quarter improvement of 4% in revenue and 6% in income. For the Quarter they paid down 500MM in Long term debt, from the 469MM in free cash flow rec'd. Maintaining their cash balance of 2.6B. Feel like the executive team is feeling pretty confident going forward right now which should bode well for the shareholders."
HAL is only earning pennies !! This thing should be at $15 - $16 bucks at most. Short it at these levels and you will make money  !!
"Can Someone Please Call UBS and inform them of the curent SP of HAL is 20.30$ --UBS Raises Price Target for Halliburton Company to $17 From $13, Maintains Sell Rating MT NEWSWIRES 12:24 PM"
drilling starting up prices should see a nice jump!!! already saw the early news jumps last week... I know everyone always says check out so and so stock but just throwing yall a bone since I'm out in gulf check out GulfSlope Energy Inc. and Vantage Drilling 2 good ones to do your research on but better research fast 
"HAL is trading at a 2 year high. Are sales at a 2 year high? Are profits at a 2 year high? Is the dividend at a 2 year high? Not saying you should sell as the fundamentals for the sector continue to be strong, but there are just better stock picks in the oil sector out there."
good quarter considering industry activity
HAL should be back to $25 today?
We getting a dividend in next 2 days?
grabbed somemore before earnings - bullish here
"Hey I everyone, I own HAL through OIH. Do you guys believe that HAL could get to 30? BofA has a price target of 33."
Demand for HAL services only increasing .. and revenue expected double in next 12 months. period.
$27 next stop
"For most of 2018, oil was in the $50 to $60 dollar a barrel range and HAL was more than double the price as today. The rig count was over 1000 in 2018, today it’s around 500. To lower the price of oil which is in the $70 plus range we need to get more rigs online. I think HAL is a good buy right now for the longs."
nice action 32 next R
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
"loving this just like 2012 thru 2014 waiting on GulfSlope Eng to start rising now and some of the other poppers like Vantage Drilling. lot of movement out here in the Gulf of Mexico, ENI hit a pretty big pocket again like they did about 7 months ago and capped off. "
Whatever you do don’t sell going into earnings..
"For anyone that has been sitting on some cash, today is a great day to buy $XOM, $COP, $PSX, $VLO, $SLB, $HAL, $BKR, $MPLX, $SHLX, $PSXP. Look at microsoft. Algos are haywire. Reset before tomorrow open. Always great to get in at bargain basement prices!!!"
"It's got no steam left. Earnings were so - so, more on the negative side. it's time for it to begin it's decline."
Are you happy today? I did not see any news it is outperforming its peers with wide margin..
"I would think with the High Cash, that HAL does a buy back soon."
Global warming happening faster than ever and the U.S. (especially the Republican's) does little to reverse the effects of climate change. Buy OIL stocks and rack in the dough $$$$.
"Bought at 20.03 3 months ago, sold at 26.47 today. I think it's going to pull back and rebase before going any higher."
Cup and handle. SLB beat tomorrow will restart the upward momentum.
I can tell no one in here knows anything about haliburton.
Earnings beat next week!! and then very soon coming ..Dividend increase
If price holds $24.94 then this looks like a normal retest of the breakout.

"Ding #$%$ ??? oil hits 93 before Halloween maybe 100 betting the farm on Haliburton, Oxy, GulfSlope Energy and SeaDrill, sold all my others, more rigs showing up out here in Gulf its time to drill plus Biden open up 82 mil acres of Gulf ???"
Biggest problem facing the economy right now is supply chain. To move all the products sitting on those ships off the coast takes lots of fuel. We are going to need lots of oil.
here comes 25
