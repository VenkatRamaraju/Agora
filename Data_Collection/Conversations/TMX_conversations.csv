"I own my own pest company so I was curious to see how this stock is doing. ￼ With all the lawsuits against Terminix, which makes perfect sense because they run a horrible operation that gouges its customers, and the employees are mostly all spray jockeys... ￼ this company is about to die."

"Well I never thought it would happen to me after 16 years with American Home Shield. Our AC went out last week, service man shows on Tuesday to make diagnosis. Tells me he ordered parts that day only to find out no communication from him or AHS on Friday, so the phone calls are made. To this day I still have no air conditioning and no communication!! And to think I paid the service com UP FRONT FOR A SERVICE THEY CAN'T SUPPLY!!!The reviews on American Home Shield are astonishing. I will vote with my check book!!Terry"

"9 days ago I posted the disappointing results of my experience with American Home Shield. Well nothing has changed, a phone call to settle instead of repair or replace as their commercials indicate. No Air Conditioning! Thank goodness that the US has provided the opportunity to have competition in this industry. Thank you AHS for your continue ""customer no service"" as Mr. Clark Howard generically states in his radio talk show concerning the service industry!!!"

"I know several people with pest control business due to my business. The new growth they are experiencing is making them very rich and I plan on capitalizing on what I know first hand. The sell of was due to the COO leaving TMX for a better job position. Nothing has changed here under $40 was a back up the truck moment. The whales will be feeding and this market will stabilize after the nonsense in Washington is settled. Some interesting news yesterday cautious when I see news I will be vigilant the tape never lies. Stifel analyst Michael Hoffman reiterated a Buy rating and $64.00 price target on Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TMX) after meeting with the CEO, Brett Ponton, and CFO, Bob Riesbeck.The analyst stated ""Our investment thesis has TMX becoming an industry-leading compounder of growth and FCF conversion. It has meaningfully improved the operating performance to now consistently produce sales growth inline with the industry and FCF conversion of 55% to 60% of EBITDA. Next move is to drive better than market growth with a combination of organic growth and M&A and push FCF conversion above 60% consistently. There is nothing structural about the TMX regional or customer mix to preclude this from happening, including the current workout of above average Termite damage claims. TMX needs to address employee and customer retention, complete the digital transformation of the business model and has about $40mm left of the damage claim ring-fence to pay out"

Beyond #$%$ with Serv. I made money for a short bounce the day that they reported earnings only to get back in and continue averaging down. Technicals it is screaming oversold and compared to ROL it is cheap. Hoping the new week we can see some uptick and good trade news

That was an easy 20@% gain. I sold Friday and took it but probably should have held onto it. Terminix is the best product out there by far
