"I know several people with pest control business due to my business. The new growth they are experiencing is making them very rich and I plan on capitalizing on what I know first hand. The sell of was due to the COO leaving TMX for a better job position. Nothing has changed here under $40 was a back up the truck moment. The whales will be feeding and this market will stabilize after the nonsense in Washington is settled. Some interesting news yesterday cautious when I see news I will be vigilant the tape never lies. Stifel analyst Michael Hoffman reiterated a Buy rating and $64.00 price target on Terminix Global Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: TMX) after meeting with the CEO, Brett Ponton, and CFO, Bob Riesbeck.The analyst stated ""Our investment thesis has TMX becoming an industry-leading compounder of growth and FCF conversion. It has meaningfully improved the operating performance to now consistently produce sales growth inline with the industry and FCF conversion of 55% to 60% of EBITDA. Next move is to drive better than market growth with a combination of organic growth and M&A and push FCF conversion above 60% consistently. There is nothing structural about the TMX regional or customer mix to preclude this from happening, including the current workout of above average Termite damage claims. TMX needs to address employee and customer retention, complete the digital transformation of the business model and has about $40mm left of the damage claim ring-fence to pay out"
Low volume the games are not over yet but we have time for $50

That was an easy 20@% gain. I sold Friday and took it but probably should have held onto it. Terminix is the best product out there by far
"Bleeding continues, no end insight and no catalyst for it to stop considering management discussion....I'd say $30 would be bottom."
