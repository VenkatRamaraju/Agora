Thumbs up if you think Lucid is going to stay in the green by 1 PM Pacific standard. thumbs down if you think it’s going to red 1 PM Pacific standard?
Row row row your boat gently down the stream merely merely merely life is but a dream. Stay positive folks
You buy this for long term not fit daily trades. This cad easily go to $300 in a few years. Everyone left Tesla for dead for years. Look at now. Billion dollar factory plant is built for a reason.
These are the times to buy
Motor trend test drove 409 miles on single charge and car still had 20% charge left. WoW!
I remember people were fighting each other just for an opportunity to get in at the 50s now no one will touch it when not much has changed! I will start loading up here sometime later this week! Bright future at Lucid
I was expecting more hype now that the 500 range isn’t just a theory anymore
Bought more :)
"Yeah, all the PIPErs selling for $2 profit on Sept 1 is the only thing awaiting this stock this year, sell guys! I am being sarcastic."
"We’ll see how rivian does when they ipo with a 70-80 billion evaluation. Lucid has better range, speed, etc. Both will have vehicles hitting marker for first time. Can rivian really trade at twice the valuation."
"Shorts are not honest, they are spreading lies for their benefit with no respect to other people who could loss because of them"
"3 things I am sick of hearing - Squeeze is coming - Apple announcement - To the Moon. I have a ton a shares, and for months I have heard the same BS. This is long term investment. Shorts have their fun, and this board has the same usual cast of characters. There are only about 3 people I pay any heed to. I am a don't tell me, show me kind of girl. So show me."
2957 shares in my 401k so far. I won't need the $$$ for a good 5 years. Smart investment? Or are there better ones? Thanks for any input.
Does LCID also come out of a quiet period on September 1st at the same time as PIPE lockup ends? News will start rolling in on and after Sept 1st? They have been awfully quiet.
25 - 30 when the delivery date gets announced...40-50 when the deliveries start and people start showing off their cars...it’s a strong possibility the stock price will double or triple this year!
"green by end of the day, and tomorrow 22.5$"
"I increased my position by 25% today. May add more if the slide continues. The aqueous cooling technology, alone, is enough to displace TSLA in the luxury EV space. Be prepared to wait 5 years for gthe big payoff. You will soon never see acquisition prices this low when shipments commence in 30-60 days. 2022 will see this stock up 5 fold by year's end, IMO."
Good news is coming longs!
"All the shorts that call this company/stock a scam... why are you even in here? Even at $15, if you believe this company is such a 'scam'... why even spend $15 or even $10? It doesn't matter what the price of the stock is... if you don't believe in the company/stock, don't buy it. Most of the people that are investing in this stock, believe in the company. All the other investors AND traders that are quietly, looking for lower entry point, good luck."
Lot's of weak emotional investors here
Saw lucid car in New York . Impressive and beats Tesla by all standards. Tesla looks so much cheaper . And I have bunch of Tesla stock . I’m long in both .
Wow! That surprises me! Even trying to recover before Sept 1st.
Everything on this board is just noise.Tune back in in 2025.
Do u think this will go up to $100 by 2025
"The drivetrain will be the basis of many innovations, this isn’t just a car company."
"I guess the report gave the feeling that they are still improving on a few things before starting real production and that delivery could be at least weeks away, not days. That may be having an impact. Personally I thought this test was on a production-ready car. I don't think that matters in the big picture, but market seems to be very impatient and hard to please at the moment.The stock may be done or very close to being done with the bottoming process anyway, so I wouldn't worry."
"What are these discord links? I don't want to join any other sites. Unless, of course. it is worthwhile information."
"Judging by the increasing amount of short comments, I think it is time to buy more shares. :)"
Closing in the green today!
The only smart option right now is to start loading up heavy on lcid
Positive news coming in the next month.1. Motor trend magazine results verifying LCID has the longest range EV in the world.2. August 30 deadline for these fake lawsuits.3 September EPA/ Crash test results.4. October starts deliveries of lucid vehicles.Check back on this stock come November 1 and let’s compare the $21 currently to what it will be on that date. Cheers
Could some one please share the details on warrants if you have any. I'm just wondering about the timeline for warrants redemption. Thanks!
"so close to my goal. at 900 shares now. 100 more by eoy. maybe 1200 shares, if things keep this way? holding for at least 5 years."
I just read the motor trend review it was released at 6 AM Pacific time and it’s a good review not one negative thing about Lucid. everything was positive. Before 6 AM Lucid was pre-market down $.72 and now the people are starting to read this article it’s down to $.47 and closing down so this article is good news
"Production is there, they stamped the production count in the car under test "
"Wow, it’s either bashers or winers, where all the investors"
"The shorts all scoffing at the test drive, yet not long ago they were all saying the claims for the technology were false and the cars were fake. Well, the car is real and drove from LA to SF and beyond and had mileage to spare. This is a technology race, and Lucid are out in front by 17%. There can be no better foundation for an EV start-up than having the greatest range. Unless the bashers can think of one (I stress start-up: not being production yet is hardly a fair pre-requisite for a successful start-up). Range is the absolute key to success, it obviates the need for rapid charging (although Lucid win on that front also). GLA, hold firm"
Motortrend loves Lucid. Beats Tesla in every way possible. He loves the interior. Mic drop moment. Lucid is the Premium electric car to beat. Tesla plaid still cant even get the paint without defects or foam hanging loise and all parts from sqeeking. Lucid. Your time to shine starts today.
Believe it or not ...some people still think writing on this board will help the price go up or down.
"Soo... what exactly happened between 1:30-2pm? Anyone have their guesses ready?Volume was pretty consistent throughout, so it doesn't look like a spike in interest/demand."
