"NEWARK, Calif., Aug. 25, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucid Group, which is setting new standards with its advanced luxury EVs, today announced that the limited-run Lucid Air Dream Edition will be produced in two distinct versions – the Dream Edition Performance and the Dream Edition Range – each highlighting a different facet of this exceptional electric luxury sedan."
My price target is $9 in 6-12 months
Gotta know when to cover if your a short. Very happy I threw everything I had left in yesterday at close. I tried warning them but they never listen. It's gunna be an uptrend from here to deliveries.
"short more if you think it is going down to $15, short! Thank you for your discount!"
"Shorts are not honest, they are spreading lies for their benefit with no respect to other people who could loss because of them"
tomorrow is the start of the selloff here. should sell now if you cant load more below.
"Just got home and all tired, started reading some of the comments here, my god so much bashing, shorts the way I see it, it only down by .60 cent, its up by the same amount for the day, come on get a life cause come tomorrow it gonna be up again. Now if you gonna bash me I won't be doing any reading cause I am retiring for the night preparing for tomorrow.thank you."
Good news is coming longs!
Do u think this will go up to $100 by 2025
Lot's of weak emotional investors here
Thank God I’m not a short right now
I keep refreshing 'Motortrend' site. waiting to see the review.
Looks like pipe is baked in already.
"Hi, test....is this board on?? where's everybody at?"
"Guys I am now bearish on this stock.With imminent news of production coming and deliveries , AND being the first EV with 500+ miles on a single charge I would recommend everyone sell now. The following is my reasoning: Motor Trend is a fake magazine, which reviewed the Fake Air.Share Authorization = Dilution Yes all employees that have stock will sell immediately , because I know this since I work in corporate America and have a ESP of my own.We are down 6$ in a month, My projections were 15 dollars but I am sure it will go there. PFT... nvm those are #$%$ reasons."
It was $28 a couple months back. Lets not get ahead of ourselves.
It’s a buy. Shorts are using scare tactics.They themselves are afraid
Without shorts we wouldn’t be grabbing cheap shares . G-d bless shorts . Cheers
"-150 points in reading comprehension for all those retail investors that just sold after-hours. Never, never, never panic-sell people. If you have been keeping up with the SEC documents, you will recognize a lot of familiar numbers in that 434B3 that was just submitted. Not much has changed. They probably just had some share numbers off in the Amended S-1."
Patience is the Key.
"Who was afraid of the pipe lock-up expiration? Has anyone seen the volume today? That sell-off doesn't seem to be happening... not many are getting shaken from their position. Judging by what's happening today, we'll see how the law of supply and demand plays out tomorrow.I'm just curious what irrational shorts (not all of them... just the mindless, blabbering ones) will move onto next once people realize this was over-blown."
Wow! That surprises me! Even trying to recover before Sept 1st.
This board is gunna turn from a bear den into a straight rodeo in a blink.
"Just because the stock price didn't move up, all you heard about the car and what was written in the review after test drive - everything in invalid? Come on! You don't have to be Warren Buffet to know that thinking is not right."
4 fingers = 4 digit horsepower number ( above a thousand HP )
"Lucid Group, which is setting new standards with its advanced luxury EVs, today announced Production Preview Week at AMP-1, a series of events the week of September 27, 2021, during which Lucid will open the doors of its Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) factory in Casa Grande to members of the media and financial communities, policymakers, and a select group of customers. Invited guests will be able to observe the production processes for the Lucid Air and take a deep dive into Lucid's advanced EV technology with leading engineers"
They have pushed the stock market to unrealistic high value and now they are adjusting it. After a pandemic the stock market hardly can do v shape recovery.
"German review was pretty good considering BMW and Mercedes! If the old knowledge proves that competition stimulates business, the established manufacturers should be happy. Because the Lucid Air immediately makes a pretty passable impression and is likely to attract customers who don't care about an upscale image. The only question is how many there will be. Because the numerous attempts by other manufacturers did not end up due to the fact that their contribution was somehow uncompetitive. The first trip with the Lucid Air certainly left us with the impression that we shouldn't underestimate the brand."
Saw lucid car in New York . Impressive and beats Tesla by all standards. Tesla looks so much cheaper . And I have bunch of Tesla stock . I’m long in both .
"Awesome!, the more it drops the more I buy. Gimme Gimme !! Cheap shares !!, thanks !!!"
Hahaha why can't people read a document properly? You can't read.? You loose... see you tomorrow morning when it's up 10% 
Lucid is sending out emails to confirm orders 
"Funny - Lucid goes further, but won’t qualify for EV subsidy$, and I still plan on buying a more affordable, versatile, spacious, futuristic Canoo"
Huge factory..drove by it.
"Motor Trend article will be available at August 25 @ 6:00am PST (tomorrow morning).Going through the comments for his last Lucid-related Instagram post... he responded to a comment ""I'm going to tell you tomorrow. Promise."" It was hard to decipher which user comment he was replying to... but it was either referring to Rawlinson's 'four-finger gesture' or delivery dates."
Who was forced to sell due to margin increase?

Motor Trend Review tomorrow ! EPA and crash test results this week ? Inevitable production and delivery news . 12 more days of quiet Period ... Poor shorties.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/lucid-s-spac-investors-could-be-forced-to-endure-a-windfall
"On hourly chart, if next week break the 20.9 low it should have a small bounce back, after that we need to wait and see if it can break the resistance 23.53 . Good luck guys."
After hours is meaningless
"Please, please, please start delivering next week!"
"ok folks, lets all remember, this is a long term investment not Las Vegas. Take a breath and relax. I look at the numbers monthly. That's it. Production will start shortly. The sales numbers will do all the talking."
"1.6 billion out standing shares, $21 a share, there is no way this company worth 35billion! The stock price should go to $10"
Still a gap above in the 40s that will need to close soon.
Lucid would be the best pick for Apple. New EV high tech luxury in the market can’t go wrong
Lieberman made it 403 miles in one charge with plenty left. Review august 25th. To the moon 
"Seriously people, Think what this is going to be worth in 5-10 years when electric vehicles are mainstream. When this company is producing on all cylinders and they start producing $50,000 cars that outperform all the competition? This is a once in a generation investment opportunity. Think Tesla at its origin. Easily at least a 10 bagger from here. Probably more like a 20+ bagger in 10 years. One of the few can't miss early retirement stocks that's as close to a sure thing there is with all the great leaders they have leading this company. That's not even taking into account the value of their battery technology. Basically what this company boils down to is what Mr. Buffet said. ""The stock market is simply a transfer of wealth from the patient to the impatient. Cheers to all the investors out there who have the patience to become wealthy! Good luck to all!"
Any bag holders from the CCIV days? I come back here from time to time just to remind myself never to buy a spac.￼
Motortrend loves Lucid. Beats Tesla in every way possible. He loves the interior. Mic drop moment. Lucid is the Premium electric car to beat. Tesla plaid still cant even get the paint without defects or foam hanging loise and all parts from sqeeking. Lucid. Your time to shine starts today.
Shorts won't have any problem sleeping tonight with the report due tomorrow?
Tomorrow 5% up at least ……So buy now!!!
"Basher says - ""Can you imagine trying to find a competent work force from the stoners who live in and around Casa Grande. What a complete joke. I wouldn't trust those goobers to build a go kart that didn't break down every 50 miles.Of course, they built the two cars that drove 500 miles from LA to SF on one charge, didn't they?"
"Pleasant surprise waiting outside as we wrapped up a great @Zoox tech round table discussion this am concerning the #BipartisanInfrastructureDeal, climate change impacts & the massive clean energy investments we need. Great to experience @LucidMotors latest EV"
"Every one unbelief Tesla when they start as well as apple and Amazon You can’t judge the start up company I do believe lucid for long term If you don’t like the recent results don’t buy it, just remember $20 price after 5 years"
23.00 coming up!!!
thought it is going to $15?
Could some one please share the details on warrants if you have any. I'm just wondering about the timeline for warrants redemption. Thanks!
"Wow, whomever is doing all the pre-market trading in LCID ... clearly does not have a clue about the market."
deadline for bogus lawsuits... tomorrow we fly
"Scam? If so, why would the company make this announcement/invite people to its manufacturing plant? You know why? Because it isn't a scam, it's real. A few more tight curves to get around before getting on the straightaway. For ""investors"" this is a good bet. ;-) Tue, August 31, 2021, 9:00 AMNEWARK, Calif., Aug. 31, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucid Group, which is setting new standards with its advanced luxury EVs, today announced Production Preview Week at AMP-1, a series of events the week of September 27, 2021, during which Lucid will open the doors of its Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) factory in Casa Grande to members of the media and financial communities, policymakers, and a select group of customers. Invited guests will be able to observe the production processes for the Lucid Air and take a deep dive into Lucid's advanced EV technology with leading engineers.Any questions?"
"all the haters are out and about... lol. its cool... listen, the review reinforced what I already believed which is these guys will make a great car. so in time, the rest will work itself out. in the meanwhile, buy cheap. haha. poor shorties, stop stressing."
LA to SF was long way.. I-5 north then across west to Paso Robles then North 101 to SF. Still had 100 + miles left. Also 101 more hilly and curvy than I-5
"Somebody knows something good, news probably a day away. Let’s begin that climb up the ladder."
"Lucid Preparing To Kick Off Of Air Dream Edition Deliveries? The company won’t specifically say when, but those who reserved a Dream Edition just got an email asking them to confirm their order. Lucid has already missed its target for the start of Air sedan deliveries, which were expected to commence in spring 2021. But now that it has not met that deadline and not announced any new clear date, those who reserved the Air are still waiting for confirmation and they don’t really know when they’ll be able to take delivery of their vehicles. The first vehicles to be delivered are the Air Dream Edition models and the people who reserved those just got an email announcing them to Get ready to confirm your Dream Edition. It's nearly time to confirm your order."
"What are these discord links? I don't want to join any other sites. Unless, of course. it is worthwhile information."
I bought more below 20
Lucid entering car show tomorrow Friday and Saturday. Preorder will start pumping in. Get ready
Believe it or not ...some people still think writing on this board will help the price go up or down.
I was expecting more hype now that the 500 range isn’t just a theory anymore
Insiders paid $15 and risked billions but somehow these kids in this chatroom are talking trash and trying to make a buck shorting the stock... shorting lucid at this time is very risky. Odds are much higher for this to double and triple from here. When its time to short a stock there is no shame in doing so if you are investing to make money. But at this price - no thank you. Holding long and strong for now. Lets make it rain $ for now. Up up up
It’s crazy tomorrow morning this is will be up 35% or down 8%
"We’ll see how rivian does when they ipo with a 70-80 billion evaluation. Lucid has better range, speed, etc. Both will have vehicles hitting marker for first time. Can rivian really trade at twice the valuation."
"There's no market for a $179,000 EV from a company with no track record. Quit kidding yourselves."
"Super volatile days are back. Embrace them. We will soon hit all time high. Get ready for the days that we have $5 swings (not in low $20s, but in low $30s)"
"We all know Tesla AI day was just to keep the fanboys excited and it works, none of these “Day Events” amount to anything, Elon has mastered the art of promoting his company."
I just read the motor trend review it was released at 6 AM Pacific time and it’s a good review not one negative thing about Lucid. everything was positive. Before 6 AM Lucid was pre-market down $.72 and now the people are starting to read this article it’s down to $.47 and closing down so this article is good news
Everyone is so concerned about fundies and what they are going to produce in a year or so. SQUEEZE COMING IN SOON!!!!! Diamond Hands!
Motor trend test drove 409 miles on single charge and car still had 20% charge left. WoW!
The only smart option right now is to start loading up heavy on lcid
"The independent reviews (which are on the horizon) will be powerful, assuming they are right on. News from the company is always good, but of course there will always be a little spin. Independent, third party reviews generally don't pull any punches. Get a couple of these positive reviews under your belt, meet your delivery expectations, and this stock will look much different in short order. Common sense."
oversold. only way is up meow lol
"I'm Buying all I can ,, Loading up"
"Quiet period over in whatever days, crash test results, EPA rating, all coming very very soon."
"For a company that hasn't delivered a single product, the stock is holding very very well. You have to remember, Tesla had product out in the public 2 years prior to the IPO at $17 a share.. just something to think about."
"Hrmm, I thought that sell-off after-hours yesterday was due to the SEC filing... but the trending today doesn't make sense. The EV market seems to be red across the board, so perhaps everyone is preparing for the Jackson Hole tomorrow. I guess I was wrong about the impact of the first drive review. There was nothing really negative that came out from the review, aside from the fact that it wasn't an actual production car. Lieberman made several points and was clearly impressed with overall aesthetics of the exterior/interior of the car. He also gave the car considerable praise on the responsive handling for a car that weight. The stock-side dip does seem to be correcting the discount (in relation to the warrants)."
I’m thinking Jan 2023 options. Should be well into production. Any thoughts?
"Glad to see all the bashers out this morning, missed you yesterday.Review coming out this morning , Quiet period ends in 11 days , EPA numbers and crash test results this week or next ?"
Thumbs up if you think Lucid is going to stay in the green by 1 PM Pacific standard. thumbs down if you think it’s going to red 1 PM Pacific standard?
Does LCID also come out of a quiet period on September 1st at the same time as PIPE lockup ends? News will start rolling in on and after Sept 1st? They have been awfully quiet.
"If you are getting in, you better hurry, lucid train is leaving the station"
I remember people were fighting each other just for an opportunity to get in at the 50s now no one will touch it when not much has changed! I will start loading up here sometime later this week! Bright future at Lucid
What is your source of share offerings or just trying short this like always.
Easy $60 by Friday!
Well October is closing in very quickly and every day that goes by with no news is one day less red because eventually they’re gonna have to announce something soon and they have September left and then that’s it so somethings coming in the next month and it’s going to be good news so keep buying on the dip
"Best decision I made was to ignore you pumpers and sell this with a profit, now I'll buy this back in the mid to low teens just like the pipe"
Good to see real news about LCID appearing here in the main page instead of all fake lawsuits.
Anyone look forward to Sept04?
I can't tell you what kind of news to expect but what I can see is that this stock has been basing better part of a year. Any positive move could be explosive. Just hope it's soon.
"I live in Omaha and I bought a Dream. Now they tell me I'll have to fly to one of their ""design studios"" in either New York, Miami or Los Angeles to pick up my car. Seems like a weird way to sell cars."
"My bet is ~if~ Lucid waivers on sales, they become a take-over target for thier technology and manufacturing plants. Either way , that is how I rationalized buying-in to the stock.Let's see how 'smart' my choice is in January 2022."
when ppl fear is time to buy with good price.
Anyone know why the after hour drop???
"I just want to take a moment and Thank all the shorts, you gave me yet another chance to pick up some shares. Despite averaging up, you allowed me to add to my position right before good news, and quiet period ends."
Positive news coming in the next month.1. Motor trend magazine results verifying LCID has the longest range EV in the world.2. August 30 deadline for these fake lawsuits.3 September EPA/ Crash test results.4. October starts deliveries of lucid vehicles.Check back on this stock come November 1 and let’s compare the $21 currently to what it will be on that date. Cheers
And its not 20 thousand cars it's over 30 thousand cars delivered by end of 2022.
I can’t wait for Lucid to release production news. I will double down on my investment then.
Motor Trend review is out tomorrow. Should be interesting. I am looking forward to reading it.
"My takeaway from the Motor trend article is ""remember range anxiety? As with the internal combustion engine, it's a thing of the past."" I just read an article about the Polestar traveling in California and how much of a problem it is with range and charging, obviously not the case with Lucid. Way ahead of the competition."
ok let's go
"Calm down people, this is just a registration of shares for future redemption of warrants. Chill out"
"After Motor Trend's first drive, it looks like Lucid is entertaining guesses on HP. ... per the Lucid's twitter page: ""Can you guess the max HP of a Dream Edition?""Maybe some of these formal tests are returning better than expected figures?"
Mike I have never understood why people don't buy the warrants...especially when it is a cashless exchange
"Any more hand gestures by the CEO to try to move the stock price? I'm long on LCID, but this stock won't move until the company starts producing cars and generating revenue. The hand gestures and rumors won't get it done."
defo buying more!!! when there's fear in the market you go shopping.
Rivian going IPO this week with $80 bil valuation....already sold thousands of EV vans to Amazon...investing 30bil on mega factory.....what was I thinking investing in LCID......I am holding my bag here since $22
Will add more if it goes under 17
Target this week 26 GO LUCID GO!
Going to be very interesting to see how many early investors and eligible employees sell on the unlock.
Does anyone know who the major institutional holders are? Any amount of shares they hold? Also when does analyst coverage start? Thanks for any helpful information!
25 - 30 when the delivery date gets announced...40-50 when the deliveries start and people start showing off their cars...it’s a strong possibility the stock price will double or triple this year!
People still believe Rome was built in a day
"All that bashing manage to bring down only 2%. Shorts forget who's backing up Lucid, these guys have too much money, good try though."
Lucid is a company I want to invest in and watch grow! As I’m sure they will!!!!
"The hour fingers most likely stands for Sep 4th . That is 40 days from name change.""The quiet period on Wall Street is the block of time before a company's IPO and after the company registers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).During this time, the company must not share any information that isn't in the papers and forms it has filed with the SEC. The quiet period is meant to avoid inflating stock prices before an IPO. It also prevents investors from getting inside information that they aren't supposed to have."""
Shouldnt trade less than 30
"If there was going to be PIPE selling, you would think they would be pumping up the stock."
Bought more :)
"Lucid is a start up, that hasn't even started yet. Tesla is a solid proved ev business. So, quit comparing it to Tesla"
"This is a riot. Do bashers think they make an impact, or are all these comments just a bunch of friends horsing around.Oh well, either way it’s funny."
"I guess the report gave the feeling that they are still improving on a few things before starting real production and that delivery could be at least weeks away, not days. That may be having an impact. Personally I thought this test was on a production-ready car. I don't think that matters in the big picture, but market seems to be very impatient and hard to please at the moment.The stock may be done or very close to being done with the bottoming process anyway, so I wouldn't worry."
How exactly do you buy an Air? Do they deliver it? Do you have to go to the factory? Where can I test drive one? It took Tesla 5 years and billions of dollars to figure that out. I really think you longs believe in the tooth fairy if you think LCID is anywhere close to being a real car company.
Patiently waiting for that Motor Trends article everything else is just noise!
"I explained to my 10 year old how Lucid sells its cars and I asked him if that seemed like a smart way to do it. In less than 3 seconds I had his answer. ""Nope""."
"52 million short, trapped and desperate will continue to attack!!! Best time to buy and hold!!!"
"it's been heading down for the past 2 months, it's time to head back up, maybe this week"
"Zero cars, zero revenue, zero profits. Single digits next."
more range; more BHP; more dreamdrive...
"PIF lock up period ends tomorrow, does anyone here that are buying actually knows what this means?"
"30 share here, 20 shares there... I have been accumulated 780 shares. my goal is 1000 by EOY. looking great. in 3 years, this bad boy will be worth 10 fold."
Partnership with glovis!!!
Anyone else just get the email?
"I’m long on this but I do not understand why it is not gaining on the positive Motor Trend article. If that doesn’t move this higher, even a little, what’s it going to take?"
"We are just discuss trading not doing personal attack. I am long in LCID , 2800 shares ave at $25, I am fine even if the stock price drop to $10, because most of the money was made in last swing from under $18 —$27. From my TA , if the price goes lower than 17.25 if have very big chance to bounce up big, but we still need to wait and see and confirm. There are few reasons why this stock is keep going down. 1) value is too high. Lucid haven’t sold any vehicle yet , it can’t worth 35billion now, ask your self how much Apple is worth? And how much profit Apple is making annually? 2) Saudi is holding 63% of the shares, how much Wall Street is holding? Very little I think, so WS will not do ads for lucid , they won’t pump lucid, cause they have very littleInterest in it. Even a good stock still need pump, isn’t it? 3) lucid ceo falled of his promise, damaged his credit. Investors don’t like that.Don’t be mad just because I said some thing you don’t want to hear. We need to wait and see how the market react to lucid cars, if the sales is very good and factory able to produce enough cars, then the price maybe go high even before the earning turns to positive. But that is uncertainty, that is the risk we have to bear. Most likely the consumer like lucid cars, but we still have to wait and see."
Are we expecting a sell off tomorrow? Cause I’m waiting to load more . Should be an interesting 1-2 weeks
These games will be over soon. Shorts been having to much fun.
Need some good news
cant wait to see the first ones in Germany
"When investors begin to understand the underpinnings of the lucid, man are they going to find it hard to imagine the stock was dirt cheap at $22 a share once. #7Bagger"
Wow...$1.18 up yesterday and a $1.00 down today. How do you explain that
i am a believer and i hold significant amount of shares but i cant believe people think lucid can compete with tesla ...i just pray to finally see some deliveries
LCID borrow rate on my shares went from 28% to 36% overnight. Shares are becoming very difficult to borrow. Squeeze is on the horizon....
"Every day, bashers with multiple accounts crawl out of the hole and spams fuds nonstop, yet manage to bring down 1-2% smh. One positive catalyst and back in the hole you go for months again. Downtrend been going on too long, upside potential much greater, now."
As I said 23.30 today!
"Poor management, could not announce the first delivery date or any good news to keep the stock price"
"Where my 20$ bashers at ?Where my 15$ bashers at ?Where my 9$ bashers at ?Where my ""I can do math"" bashers at ?Where my ""I can read SEC docs"" bashers at ?come on guys where we at, just isn't the same without you ?"
Motortrend made the trip from LA to San Fransisco looked at some Rolex watches for Peter and to the lucid studio 435 miles and still plenty of range left. Lieberman will let us know how much on his video on Wednesday. This is in the dream edition that only has 503 mile range and not the 517 model.
"PIPE investors are blackrock, fidelity, and pif. Do you really think they will sell for a $5 profit? These are long holders that want to see big gains."
"Judging by the increasing amount of short comments, I think it is time to buy more shares. :)"
what just happened?
"Longs, as I told you, your target price changed again! Last week I said your target price will be change from 25$ to 20$, and its realized. You never can get a profit again in this stock, you know, Lucid have a great fear about their car making and confidence. Stop investing it and short it for recover your money. This company perfectly failed."
Added more!! Thanks for the discount
A lot of shorts may be waiting for PIPEs to sell off on Sept 1. I guess PIPEs know better than to sell for a paltry profit when 10x gains is in the horizon. Lack of selling on Sept 1 should trigger a drastic reversal.
"If you sold you made a mistake, tomorrow is a big day"
"10:1 there are some big buys that come through in the last hour to tempt retail to jump in.. it’s looking like some folks are desperate to get out with a decent return, only time will tell. I’m guessing someone bought in the mid $20’s region and were hoping to exit before Sept 1. Looks like they may have to take the risk and see how things end up by Fri."
"think its around 46 million warrants bought at $1 a piece...which that has nothing to do with it. Can be exercised for $11.50. Then there are retail Warrants to add to that. There are approx 1.6 Billion common shares , so absorbing the warrants when exercised shouldn't have that much of an impact like some people are making you believe. The warrents plus the $11.50 have been averaging about $1.50 cheaper to buy a common stock."
Lucid air spotted driving by factory during bear’s den flyover. They are everywhere.
"one car: 478 miles, the other: 516 miles"
Why do certain trolls sound exactly the same. Same person. Different account???? Hahaha 
Interest rate on borrowed shares just raised to 28% by Schwab. Thank you shorty!
What’s the meaning behind rawlinson’s four fingers when he has posed for pics recently. Is that a tip?
Added another 25% of my port at close up to 50%. Let's see what happens looking to go all in.
"Tesla Slayer...our product Supply/Demand is geared towards wealthy and upper middle class.A Lucid is exclusive...and Road and Track thinks it is the best.Eventually, when they can create enough supply to sell to ""regular"" people...they might? Lamborghini and Porsche do just fine as exclusive brands."
Everything on this board is just noise.Tune back in in 2025.
"Lucid Air, best sedan ever made."
today the first article review will come out...it will smash everything!!
Circuit breaker time imminently
"Market can be unreasonable for a while, but eventually the reality catches up. The news of test drive from LA to SF with 100+ miles to spare was huge news. It should have gone up by at least $5 yesterday on the news."
"Dream Edition Performance is optimized for speed and acceleration, delivering an incredible 1,111 horsepower. Dream Edition Range has 933 horsepower, while maximizing range. EPA range certification is currently in process and will be announced soon."
"2400 employees900 open positions on LinkedIn30 studios & service centers11,000 reservations"
Sold at $24. Will buy back again at $15-17.
"We don't want a preview of production, we want Production. The show must end, just invite some investors and news anchors."
"Wow, it’s either bashers or winers, where all the investors"
Look up Why PIPEs won't sell off all their LCID shares upon lockup expiration. Shorts been trying to scared retail investors and the reason for the slow steady decline.
I am extremely bullish on this!! The price has not changed my mind. Still have cash in case it goes down more. Some ppl may not like me.. but I hope it does so I can get those cheap shares. You can buy it back from me in 2026 or 2028. #YOLO
oktober production!! confirmed!
Back to 10
You buy this for long term not fit daily trades. This cad easily go to $300 in a few years. Everyone left Tesla for dead for years. Look at now. Billion dollar factory plant is built for a reason.
Think lucid and rivian are on same time line for delivery. Waiting for epa and crash test result. Heard lucid and rivian cars were being tested at same time. Rivian says they are estimating September delivery.
"Yeah, all the PIPErs selling for $2 profit on Sept 1 is the only thing awaiting this stock this year, sell guys! I am being sarcastic."
Looks like a new EV leader to me
"Production is there, they stamped the production count in the car under test "
"this week & next week are buying weeks, you'll never see these prices again. the last week of September will be huge once the open house is complete and the first of many production vehicles hit the road. next we will see lucid tech in airplanes, outboard motors ect."
"In spite of the 5% move today, market may still be pricing in another 'sell the news' tomorrow, like so many that happened before. If that doesn't turn out to be the case and the report is really juicy then we are going to have fun."
LCID is being manipulated again.
Production preview week starts the week of Sep 27th. Hopefully we will get delivery dates then.
Maybe the 4 he was holding up means 4pm drops!
"Why is this tanking everyday? Is this a case of show me the money before people will invest? I know this company has not really proven anything yet, many say this is the next TSLA but the SP. has gone down a lot. It has to have a bottom somehow. Mgmt needs to give updates on its production and how many orders and backlogs they currently have."

"Soo... what exactly happened between 1:30-2pm? Anyone have their guesses ready?Volume was pretty consistent throughout, so it doesn't look like a spike in interest/demand."
Are u guys buying at current levels? My average is $23 . I’m hoping to load more at $21 level . .
Future is bright. I see this stock hitting $250 by year end 2022. The time for ev stocks is now.
"I'm not even going to try to predict/time the bottom of this dip. Unlike the shorts on this board, I'm no 'psychic' and not going to 'pretend' to know what's going on with the stock prices. Any current investor should know what catalysts are right around the corner, and why Lucid is being quiet. They simply have to wait for the US govt to provide a EPA rating, and a crash test result. If you feel comfortable waiting and getting in at a lower price, I would say go for it. With each dip, it's getting closer and closer to my cost-basis... but I don't think we are going to see prices we saw back in May. I have time, and I can sit/wait. The point I'm going to bring up is very simple. The EPA and crash test results can show up at any time. This is directly correlated to the delivery date announcement. If you understand why Rawlinson can only say ""second half of 2021"", you will understand that he is saying that because he honestly doesn't know when he will get the green light from the government."
"All the shorts that call this company/stock a scam... why are you even in here? Even at $15, if you believe this company is such a 'scam'... why even spend $15 or even $10? It doesn't matter what the price of the stock is... if you don't believe in the company/stock, don't buy it. Most of the people that are investing in this stock, believe in the company. All the other investors AND traders that are quietly, looking for lower entry point, good luck."
These bargain prices won't last long
Lot's of Tesla fan boys here bashing Lucid Motors even tho Lucid has 20% more range lol sorry Tesla fan boys but y'all have to admit Lucid has impressive tech y'all scared or something?
"The new big 3: LUCID,FISKER, TESLA. These 3 companies will run the car technology for the next 50 years"
"Oh wow, something happen? All my EV positions not looking too pretty right now."
"I'll say it again. SP reflects the value of the company and more importantly perceived value- warrants, splits etc are irrelevant to actual value. Take advantage of the discount. Go LCID!!"
This should be above 40 when the cars release. i'm going to sleep over this stock until i can trade it for a real luid car. lol maybe 10 years.
when will the lawsuit finish?
"green by end of the day, and tomorrow 22.5$"
"so close to my goal. at 900 shares now. 100 more by eoy. maybe 1200 shares, if things keep this way? holding for at least 5 years."
Lucid should us SSB from QS to be able to go down the price and safety isuue ( no fire ).Lucid will be one of OEM EV factory.
Delivery is Q3 which is next month.
She gunna touch 30 today at power hour. Mark it!
Let's see what is going tomorrow. I got some today and would like buy more tomorrow if it still keep this price.
LCID will close green today. You heard from me.
Stay strong and carry on. Never give up. Never give in.
Eventually lucid will be the main culprit on taking chunks away from teslas sp. You see tesla at 700 you see lucid at 21 with better tech and better cars. This will take off at some point again. Question is when
Yes first delivery is mid September probably no longer under $25  soon
Dude the stock is shorted at 21% as of today. The shorts are hitting this hard. I am waiting for the squeeze. I don't know about everyone else.
Bought 50 more shares at $20 . Plan to load more at $19 if it’s to happen .
"If production preview is September 27, then clearly production begins in October. Vroom-vroom!! (that's artificial EV noise required by NHTSA) LCID soon in 40s."
Y’all will regret if not buying at these levels. Its easy $50 plus stock EOY
Lucid Motors a Trillion dollar company in the making
just tired of holding this s...t for a long time now!
Remember Nikola day they were gonna invite guest to see the factory? I just wanted to put that out there!
Warrants held tight!! And they are owned mainly by smart money!!
Added another 100 shares @ the end of the day. 500 shares total. Let’s see what will happen EOY.
LCID is a sitting a steal right now at these bargain prices. Lucid Motors farthest range supreme quilty and tech
$35B market cap with zero sales.
Two distinct Air Dream Editions showcase Lucid's engineering capabilities and reset expectations for electric vehicles with versions optimized for unrivaled power and performance
lucid stock keep trying to pull me underwater while the other stock in my portfolio comes to my rescue and keep me afloat.lol.
Big news LUCID will start production in Sep 2021 and the attackers increased 
"Most of the FIRST company of a industry won't exist for long. First semiconductor FAIRCHILD, Famous Artari game. Big computer company like Tandem, Digital ... ALL GONE. ( Intel, AMD creator came from FAIRCHILD ) . LUCID creator came from Tesla. Before Google was Netscape. LUCID learn and avoud from the other companies mistakes"
"Next week should be interesting. Lots of shorts are betting something magical is happening on Sept 1st, so get your bets in there.I'm in it for the long haul and my money will be sitting here for the next few years. I'm just here to chat and get pertinent info when it shows up. I will say this though, there does seem to be more and more short interest/confidence in betting against this stock/company, which is about to release a production product. How much more can this stock get 'compressed'?The ONLY thing you need to chew on:Rawlinson and Lucid are waiting on EPA, IIHS and/or NHTSA results, which is completely out of their control. That explains why they need to wait and why we haven't heard anything, because there is honestly nothing new to report. It seems the short narrative keeps trying to disprove the obvious with the strangest pieces of logic, but this car is going to market this year-- whether they like it or not. If you need/want to bail on the stock and look for a lower entry point, all I can say is good luck."
The bleeding has stopped to some degree over at TSLA and NIO. Hopefully LCID gets the memo sometime today...
great opportunity to stock up while its cheap
When the news of delivery comes this is going to jump in the middle of a deep red market. It happens all the time for individual stocks.
2957 shares in my 401k so far. I won't need the $$$ for a good 5 years. Smart investment? Or are there better ones? Thanks for any input.
"I Better Cover,, This thing is about to take off"
"409 miles trip, 106 miles left = 515 mile range.. in practice!!! Who can beat this?"
first review from motortrend is comming up next week. the journalist will drive the car for the next few days.
to the moon $45 next month
"What will people do when lockup expires tomorrow? Sell, Hold, or sell 1/2 of their position."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2021/06/lucid-motors-ipo-valuation-the-jokes-on-cciv-stock-owners/amp/Reference to pipe lockup expiration in this article. It is likely true that many pipe investors will take their gains with so much uncertainty right now.
Closing in the green today!
"The drivetrain will be the basis of many innovations, this isn’t just a car company."
It seems like this investment is a pipe dream
that it all
"Every single item in my portfolio is up, except...Just an observation. May buy some more,"
Shortys cover its over :)
$29 Friday!
Huge volume spikes past few minutes.
"It’s going to be a pretty interesting day tomorrow, if we jump to $26 or higher."
"production news this week , mark this post ."
Shorts are confused people....read the prospectus......we go higher
"Wow, I guess the AMC/GME thing is not over yet."
"From the earnings release: ""Lucid hopes to generate about 2.2 billion in 2022 sales and projects almost 23 billion a 10-fold increase by 2026.""Even without other tech innovation and valuation, the current price of $25 would be $250 in 2026. That's not too bad."
It’s going to be a pretty interesting day tomorrow. If it gets to 17 I’m getting in
What is the expiration date on LCIDW. Warrants?
Short Sellers right now.
Rawlinson yesterday:-https://preview.redd.it/y4yr67k6mzh71.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34a83d98fdee3d22da2f6e8bfd2bea0a6c4e42be
Everyone needs to chill out. The volatility will correct itself and production and partnership announcements will attract big players. This stock is getting primed for a break out.
when is this going to $7.00 a share?
Serious question: When the first delivery will take place? Thank you in advance for the answer.
"Don’t day trade youngsters. Buy and hold, revisit weekly. It’s investing not gambling. You can’t win all positions. Holding long term you will outperform day trading."
These are the times to buy
I just bought more on the uptrend because I believe in this company with all of my heart 
All this FUD regarding Sept 1st. Listen warrant price is 9.17 redemption price is 11.50 total price per share will be 20.67OH LOOK AT THE CURRENT PRICE. ZERO dilution!
Those four fingers mean no more 4 fingered discount from here. Ya had your chance to accumulate or switch. Glta bears. Your gunna need it. The games are over! Ah was your Alamo. We overrun you tomorrow.
"Next week retail traders will push to $18 in selloff. Pipe line will hold on lack of profit. Retail traders will come back in and buy, thinking completed pipeline sell off driving price to mid $20's and hold. Announcement on deliveries will be made and quick influx of investors pushing to near $40, then whack pipeline strikes, back to mid $20's. See if I'm right."
"For those keep comparing Tesla progress to that of Lucid. Take the stock price, about $680 vs $21 into account."
LCID making up for it in after hours. For not going up all day in a super green market.
16 tomorrow
BUY LI Auto SELL hot air overhyped below$SPCE $LCID $FSR $TSLA $XPEV
Lucid must start to deliver cars now to bring up the stock price.
why is lcid up so much in after hours? and it stayed up.. is a big short squeeze about to occur? remember it went to 60 in just a few days not that long ago
Hey don't forget what the goal is here for evs in general. The goal still is to convince ppl to even buy them! Biden used the rest of his political capital on this pull out. That 3.5 trillion dollar bill doesn't look to promising anymore which would have placed alot more charging stations all around this country. No matter what lucid is cementing there brand highlighting the best quality ev in the world. Therefor when they do make an affordable ev ppl are going to flock because by that point lucid will have proven more then any other car company in the industry that evs are better then ice's. And not in just some ways. But in everyway by far. And you only get that with lucid motors moving forward. Question is when is the best time to buy this stock?
This is going to make its way to $15
"I increased my position by 25% today. May add more if the slide continues. The aqueous cooling technology, alone, is enough to displace TSLA in the luxury EV space. Be prepared to wait 5 years for gthe big payoff. You will soon never see acquisition prices this low when shipments commence in 30-60 days. 2022 will see this stock up 5 fold by year's end, IMO."
I'm buying it tomorrow. Gonna let it roll till January 2022. Only the toes know.
"Lucid has done NOTHING for 4 months after crashing after the deal announcement. Yes it's an EV play that could compete with Tesla longer term. However it's nearly $40 Million market cap. makes it FAR from being undiscovered. What is the real demand for $170,000 cars or even the $70,000 model later. Audi, BMW, Mercedes all have models coming. Let them prove their claims with delivered cars and rave reviews. before getting into this one. NIO was $3 less than 2 years ago when China helped fund them and sales then took off. You could have waited until $8-10 when proof of sales and great reviews came and bought then for a 5-6 bagger. Lcid price is ahead of fundamentals. Wait for the fundamentals to catch up and prove that there is demand."
"Lots of interesting new stuff floating around the web tonight. Crash test pics...and came across what may be the true answer to what ""4"" means:4 finger symbolize the all the models coming soonInside info1. Air2. Gravity (suv)3. Supersonic (tri motor)4. 400 (affordable model 400 miles range)"
Motortrend Chief Editor Jonny Lieberman has his hands on a Lucid Air Dream Edition. It looks like he's actively updating his Instagram feed with updates. He said the review should be available on August 25.
Trading sideways for months…what’s the next catalyst ?
$10 by September 26th
"Insiders paid $15 and risked billions, and we can buy at 21 and risk anything we like without restriction on selling. Wow what a good time to buy and hold. Odds are we will see a double or triple in the stock price when cars hit the road."
"Investor invested NKLA at $90 without knowing when their product to delivery. On Lucid case, we see the great EV and beautiful luxury car and CEO confirmed product is on progress of production and on schedule to delivery in 2nd half of this year. Soon Lucid to deliver cars, would this price x2, 3, 4 or 10x more?"
"Preparing new cash to increase position, waiting the entry point"
"Most short sellers are trying to frustrating the long investors by keeping shorting shares even with good or bad news. Relax and keep your confidence, this stock will be up at some point and shorts will either got burnt or bankrupted or given up anyway. Or now it may be the trap for shorts to come in.? Whatever it is, keep your faith and enjoy the drive. All EV stuffs are the future."
Tried warning the bears yesterday to cover it was time to bring out there switchblades and swing trade this at the least after I loaded up at close. I mean hey I tried.
Tomorrow is going to be huge. Independent confirmation of 500+ range.
"I wonder if any other journalists got some time with the car, KBB has a big influence on the public."
"I've been waiting for LCID to slip below 20, but it may end up in 18-19 this week...possibly even below 15 if it gets very bearish. For a company with no products on the road, some would argue the stock should be below $10 by valuation. I really like their product design, but they've got a long road ahead to scale up. I'm loading up more on $XPEV and $NIO for now on their 3% pullback. I'll wait a bit longer to see where LCID ends up as it's got more bearish patterns."
Holding my 500 shares tightly not selling till $100 at least
"During the drive, a pair of Dream Edition Range cars drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco at highway speeds via central California, and then back across the San Francisco Bay to Lucid's global headquarters, traveling 445 miles on a single charge. Upon arrival, the cars displayed, respectively, 30 miles and 72 miles of charge remaining (for totals of 475 and 517 miles)."
"patience pays, just a sign of things to come"
"When this thing breaks upward, it's going to take off. We've been basing for 6 months. I look forward to the day of breakout!"
food for thought. LCID has about half the market cap of GM. GM sold almost 7M vehicles in 2020. I believe LCID sold zero in 2020 and have not delivered a single car in 2021. someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
"The shorts all scoffing at the test drive, yet not long ago they were all saying the claims for the technology were false and the cars were fake. Well, the car is real and drove from LA to SF and beyond and had mileage to spare. This is a technology race, and Lucid are out in front by 17%. There can be no better foundation for an EV start-up than having the greatest range. Unless the bashers can think of one (I stress start-up: not being production yet is hardly a fair pre-requisite for a successful start-up). Range is the absolute key to success, it obviates the need for rapid charging (although Lucid win on that front also). GLA, hold firm"
"There will come a time, and stock chasers and investors can not believe that they didn't buy LCID at these prices..."
manipulated until tomorrow. see you at 40$ soon. very soon
"One of the issues never mentioned on this board that plays into Lucid's stock position is the company's current situation, which is COMPLETELY different from other EV companies. I.e., only into its merger for about 2 weeks, basically in a start up mode from a production perspective, and is still building out its operations. So yes, the stock is gonna be somewhat volatile at this juncture of its existence. The real question is, where will it be in the next 6-18 months? I believe at that point the writing (most of it) will be on the wall. Until then, it is a guessing game. Meanwhile longs are investing in a company that promises cutting edge technology and a high-end EV like no other. So the ROI will hopefully be there. That's the gig folks. Peace."
What is happening?
"cute and all but we need production/delivery update, but ill take a green day"
Row row row your boat gently down the stream merely merely merely life is but a dream. Stay positive folks
"Nobody can predict the future of this company, but this could be a life-changing opportunity and possibly make many people very very rich or could be the next John DeLorean and f$&k you in every way. Everybody has the right to make up their mind on what they want in life because it’s their money to do with what they want. I know I’ve got 1500 shares and I’m not selling until I hit $500 a share or bust."
shorty's trying real hard AH
"3 things I am sick of hearing - Squeeze is coming - Apple announcement - To the Moon. I have a ton a shares, and for months I have heard the same BS. This is long term investment. Shorts have their fun, and this board has the same usual cast of characters. There are only about 3 people I pay any heed to. I am a don't tell me, show me kind of girl. So show me."
"We just learned the car is far superior to Tesla in every way! That is an astounding accomplishment that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Congrats to the Lucid engineering team and all longs. Lucid is Tesla 2.0. Tesla is stuck with outdated technology, ugly cars, and poor range."
Just got to wait til they start rolling out the cars : (
there are 3 lock up periods to this stock. tomorrow is #1. you really think no one is selling off??????
Finally good news
I like it more for me to buy...since I’m here for 5 years and over
This is a weird market reaction to the news of test drive. Probably hasn't spread much outside forums like this. The full report coming out on Wednesday should help. Market will soon start giving it the respect it deserves.
