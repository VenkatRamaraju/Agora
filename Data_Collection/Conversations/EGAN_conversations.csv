"Here's how I see it.....The last quarter ended 6/20/18 and will be released 9/5/18.It has been over 2 weeks since the books were closed on last quarter and they have at least a ""ballpark "" idea as to what the final results for last quarter were.My guess is they may be short of expectations and we will be the last to know.We need to show a profit. The B/V is a NEGATIVE ( 0.34) which shows up in the balance sheet as only 39M in ASSETs VS 49M in LIABILITIES, not a good sign unless you are BK. that's not to say we are going BK, we are not."
12 dollar
tomorrow should be up 13.50-14

"Sold 10% of my position at 16 today, which were bought at 8 several years ago. Bunch at 3.45 that I am letting ride for a while longer."
on the move to 12s..
Chart is looking good
Congratulations. It broke the streak.
Day traders are converging on this stock and playing it . They bring no value and only want to pick your pockets.
Egan = no gain. what's up with that. trades up and closes at low then trades up and them closes at low etc all week long.
Good ER we'll be looking at $24.
16 dollars
Up we go
What is the news and why the up when all is sooo down?
Sorry for your loss but i have said many times this company is garbage. Doesn’t belong in wall street. Not worth a dime to invest
Pretty stout since earnings.
Let your winners run
"7 weeks after liftoff a stock will revisit its 50 EMA. I bought today as a first timer at 12.40, the exact moment it hit the magic line. Not worried!"
I have never bought a company that fell 30% after earnings
They are making money..
bullish 20
EGAN needs more exposure. Need a bigger brokerage house to cover them. They make money. Growing at 30%+ with no debt and $30 million in cash. It’s a gem waiting to be discovered
"not a bad earnings report, it will recover, give it a couple of days"
Anyone now when earnings will be reported? Nothing on their website- but it should be soon.
"might fall, but will prob rise to $20 eventually over next couple months."
Selling is over.With only a few min. to trade the VOLUME is 1.31M vs a 10 day ave. of 1.26MWe should be OK tomorrow.
"Sorry Robinhoods, your lesson is being learned"
"EGAN went up so much yesterday I expected more of a pullback today, but it is holding it's own pretty good!"
Ready to go boom zoom to the moon
We are breaking out! Nice!
Beautiful drop. Caught that one holding short from 12.15. Cheers.
will this one go back 15s this week?
It’s run a great deal in this year and I’m hoping I have not been greedy. Bring on some good news and let’s test those highs again!
Dow up 250 points egan RED day after day
It should go higher short term...$12's....
Red day after day! wonder how many bagholders we got
Relieved to see positive price action today. Modest miss on revenue projections can bring some horrendous price declines in these cloud stocks. CC was good. Company has a solid product. Transition from legacy to SaaS always challenging.
is earning report going to be that bad?
"The reason for the panic selling over the past week or so is bizarre, considering the earnings report basically met expectations and even just a few days ago an analyst upgraded Egain to a 'strong buy', with several other analysts having a 'buy' recommendation as well. https://www.baseballdailydigest.com/2018/09/11/egain-egan-upgraded-by-bidaskclub-to-strong-buy.html"
Way over sold now great buy here..
"Profitable, Guiding higher ! This Cloud company on fire and Market Cap could quadruple imo, since similar companies lose money and have huge MCs."

bullish 25
Earnings today?
"Great report, impressive! Beat both EPS and REVENUE. EPS: 6c vs 1c estimates, Revenue: $19.2M vs $18.47M estimates....Go UP tomorrow to $15's. GL LONGS."
Good stock to short??
This thing is stuck in the mud. Would of like to see 30 cents today.
"Earnings will be BEAT, IT WILL GO UP TO $16'S like last time."
dont worry about ah tomorrow will be up-glta
$14's soon....
This stock drops 8 trading days in the row.
What is happening?
Egan don't have to worry about a trade war on this one. AI is were the money is flowing. Helping the consumer! Easy to set up. Great numbers with a positive out look. Exactly were the big money wants to be. Look at the volume Big money is buying.
Been watching EGAN for awhile. Bought stock today. Looks like a possible TWLO clone. Long TWLO too.
may break 16.00 this week then on up from there to new highs
TEUM will be next!
its a crapshoot with regards to dec quarter but based on everything disclosed seems like momentum is strong so at the least I think they might announce solid outlook. see my previous analysis below.https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/48947357-robo-investor/5184205-egain-investment-thesis-march-2018
"Been watching this one for a while, is this a good time to buy in?"
"Big down day in,,,greater than twice normal volume."
"just going off the financials I briefly looked at, looks like a no brainer to get in"
10 days RED
Sigh.. averaged at 8.80.
A Cloud company with EARNINGS. way undervalued market cap. See PLAN for losses and MC comparison for example. DOMO another one to compare with losses. EGAN should easily be back to highs imo.
Market finally going to catch up with me? That would be nice!
no retrace. it will go to 20 from here.
Buying now. Short raid (I hope) is ending and we may see a squeeze next wk.
http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/News/KM-In-Practice/HandR-Block-chooses-eGain-for-AI-powered-customer-engagement-129260.aspx
End around 9.45.
yup. not a bad print. YoY saas up 40%
"It is really strange market, the report was good (actually all the recent reports of $EGAN were good)Why it was down on after hours trading? Can someone explain?"
Dilution? Any explanation?
Will retrace to low 9's today.
in a few days you will be looking at 100%
"Guys, does it work entering at this price?"
When will earning be reported and do you think it will be positive net profit this time? Vote up or down on profit.
"All, Steve is a habitual short-seller based on his comments. Take a look at his other posts, Coty, Egan, many others. @steve, sorry bruh, didn’t fare out as good as the rest of us on this one...."
Conference presentation today. Apparently they have good things to say. Not a moment too soon
Anybody here can share his thoughts about earnings report? Is it after market or before market hours?
"Terrible guidance. Even after this drop, stock is still up 55%. Was way overpriced, but I do find it humorous listening to people unable to figure out why it dropped. You shouldn't be trading"
Might even be dumped below 9 today.
"LOW VOLUME the last 4 trading days. No CONFORMATION.The 10 day avg. is 1.2M and today, with just an hour and change until the close, we are 629K. no mass selling the last 4 trading days.Yahoo uses the 3 month avg. which is 457K but why would you want to use that when the stock was closing at 100k or less 3 months ago. The 10 day avg. is 2 weeks of trading and that is a better indicator of what is happening now with closes over 1M.Bottom line without VOLUME there is no need to panic."
I sure hope we can build on the gains. Shares have hard a hard time holding gains. Big volume makes me feel optimistic there may be more gas in the tank.
Sell off to begin.
"Hope the report will be ok. Good luck to all. I am just staying in the side lines...have been burned playing earnings lately. VIPS, SOL, LCI, ZM, etc. were down with good report."
The puppet master is controlling this one.... has not moved from a 20 cent range all day on 10x the normal volume and growing.
EGAN STOCK 12
Why are they delaying reporting Q2 numbers? Usually would have happened first week of August. Seems odd.
be careful shorting. this is going to 20+.
"Roughy for 12$ in 2018, was in huge lost for 2 years and now all of sudden going crazy. What’s going on??"
"NEW 52WK HIGH TODAY $19.05Could be some STOP-LOSS,Could be time for a stock offering they like to do near the 52WK High.NO SEC Filings."
Is this overvalued now?
"Actually we're all good. The charts say, end of June-first wk of July were the anomaly. Now, we are back to normal! I'm not waiting for a confirmation @ $16-17, the moving avgs/trend line confirm, time to buy is now!"
Zacks has eGain as a strong buy!!
IT'S GREEN for once
"MACD Crossover any day, better get in for quick pop to 9 or 10"
Many stocks I would sell after such a run up. This one I'm hanging on to.
Whats going on here? Any good news or increase because of prediction of Q result?
"Are we all BLIND? Take a look at the market today? All HOT GREEN, and EGAN is still RED????????????Are EGAN longs Dum' and Dum'r here?"
"Strong support today, it will start ramping UP next week. I expect $16's before Christmas."
Any news and it's off to the races $35 dollar target
# the best earnings in long time and getting better
"Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Preliminary Financial ResultsSaaS revenue is expected to be in the range of $15.3 million to $15.5 million, up 32% to 34% year over year.SaaS and professional services revenue are expected to be in the range of $16.9 million to $17.2 million, up 28% to 30% year over year.Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $18.7 million to $19.0 million, up 11% to 13% year over year."
"Loss of customers disclosed on last CC undermining the shares. A one off, or indicative of limitations of the platform? Anyone have any actual experience with the product?"
Unbelievable
Thanks for the ride Egan (expiration day) will see you again!
Hammer today. Bullish
sitting pretty at 7.40
"AH price action looks weird. The ER is good and outlook is great, investors will buy during normal trading hours"
this is going to run up..
https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/339984/why-egain-egan-could-be-an-impressive-growth-stock
Hope short covering will bring it back up to $15's this month.
bullish 16
guess this is just the overall market
WHERE IS THE BOTTOM 2 BUCKS?
it will hit a new high soon.
Hopefully this is the rebound
"I’ve always liked the stock and it’s prospects, but for whatever reason, it never seems to get the attention it deserves."
Egan showing strength close on the high with Nice volume
"Does anyone know why the CFO has cut his shares in half since the first of the year, this has always troubled me ?"
"Ya go figure , we were at $15 a week ago and there has been no bad news."
"Beat earning and revenue expectation, drop 30% is a very good buy."
buyout
I guess one will have to wait for the Q1 results unless the company changes the guidance. I don't understand much the reason for selling pressure below 11...just riding the market weakness? Any thoughts?
$EGAN has a 1/4th of teums outstanding number of shares with a MC larger than teums today. Maybe a merger would create a market dominant company or maybe one day Egan will buy us out.
bullish 50
"AI,KM, nice recovery."
"EGAN is a value here compared to ZEN, NOW, & HUBS. Yet this market keeps rewarding companies without earnings.....by current valuations, it would seem the market is telling EGAN to spend more on acquisitive growth and run deficits to put up a big top line growth number.....but any kind of earnings makes you subject to the PEG valuation metrics. The company has a strong balance sheet, LiveChat Software (LVC: PW) trades in Poland, is debt free, and has a trailing P/E of 16.....maybe these two fiscally conservative CRM companies could merge and give the bigger debt-fueled CRM companies a run for their money."
"I read the earnings report a couple of times. Honestly, I liked what I read. This is such an overreaction!"
WTH happened with the earnings?
Uh oh!
"Wow! Great week, I must say."
"Guys, don't panic, for me this stock drop was also surprise, but, it is good point for buy. If earning expectation for the next quarter were get lowered, it means in next report they easily can beat estimates, and will be good uptrend. and this without vaccine, imagine the uptrend when the vaccine will be around. All the latest earnings were beaten solidly by $EGAN. I think we need patient, what do you think?"
its getting ready to make a nother step up is howits looking
It's time to climb ...
Anyone listening to the call?
Earning is tomorrow what is expected here?
please remove this kind of garbage off wall street
"This is madness. Company beat expectations handily and said, full year subscription revs (90% of total revs) would ""come in at the high end of previously announced guidance."" Meanwhile, operating profit margins went from 2% a year ago to 10% in the quarter they just reported. Operating cash flow went from $200k last year to $3.8m in the March quarter. Oh, and they fully paid off all their debt in the quarter.You don't want to believe Nasdaq stocks get manipulated by their market makers and then this #&Y$(&Q* happens."
Great for shorting.
Craziness! What sense does it make for the stock price to be dropping so dramatically? Who is selling on the news of a positive outlook and another earnings beat? This thing has been trickling down since the prior quarter. Why sell the good news here?
very small float and short covering will propel this stock
"im super down now, around 30% I dont know what to do"
Riding this baby out.... It will overcome this.
NOTHING BUT RED AGAIN!
EGAIN HAS BEEN AROUND ALMOST 20 YEARS AND STILL CAN'T HOLD ABOVE 10
"This run up is pretty satisfying. Since 2015, I have bought shares between 3.45 and 15. Nice to see the ALL green again!"
https://www.callcentrehelper.com/egain-partners-with-altitude-software-133247.htm
I like it!
there's a reason analysts are giving this a 100% buy rating and a 1.9 buy rating on yahoo
"Seems inexpensive in SaaS space. Profitable. Share price seems to low, even with modest rate of growth."
Solid earnings
"Got in at 7.70 intially and sold at 7.95 peak yesterday, will try to get back in long at a lower price"
Is it gonna run further?
"Analyst Actions: Needham Adjusts eGain's Price Target to $15 From $16, Keeps at Buy"
Take profit. This will retrace back to the low 9's today.
Very bad stock!
Will close down 10 percent from here.
watching this stock drop like a rock when the market goes further in the green! Nice! (sarcasm)
"Question. I have been in and out of this stock for awhile, after earnings it always drops significantly.This time, they pre-released earnings, not sure why? Maybe there is a big announcement/buyout coming on the call this afternoon? I don't have a ton of shares in this company but I am up and I try to never let a profit turn into a loss. Just would like to get some feedback on what people are thinking today and if you are holding or selling before close.Remember, this stock has a pe of around 75 or so? so even if a buyout, how much higher could it really go?"
Sell.
The gap at $14.97 from 11/10 to 11/11 will be filled eventually. 30 day rule after 12/11 will work well when fund managers bought back in again...Mark this post.
Bought in at 7.90 I really like the outlook of this company going into 2019
"EGAN Quarter Earnings EPS forecast is -0.1 the actual result is 0.01, which still a beat, yet the stock dropped like crazy."
What a hidden gem
I see 20 in a week on this one.
Great quarter! Future looks very bright going forward as well. 
Any shorts not covered here are in for a hurtin’! Time to cover snd go long or feel the squeeeeeeeeze.
Guidance for upcoming quarter was light. Gratifying to see us grind higher after a soft open. For SaaS stocks it can be the kiss of death. A testament to their great product.
it will be positive before 1030.
Who is shaking my tree?
beat !!!
nice recovery
Bought at the dip earlier and will hold for $$
"Looks like 7.20 is the floor, crazy stock this one is"
Earnings should be announced next week.
"Price usually goes down just ahead of quarterly earnings to gather more investors. Similarly to SFIX, AAPL, CGC, etc... I predict quarter earnings beat."
"yet again, a nearly 5% drop on a day where there is less than 60,000 shares traded. so few shares and trades should not create a 5% impact. just sayin..."
Looks like it's for real this time.
I got eGain at $10.07. this company has momentum and slowly growing to reach its potential
"I really don't understand this stock. I know it is lightly traded. I know it had a bit of a run up before earnings. But, the company continues to churn out positive earnings and beating estimates, and it still cannot gain any traction. Last year, this thing skyrocketed on earnings. Since then, it continues to drop every time they report solid earnings and growth. Makes no sense."
im gonna place an order at 7.15 o 7.20Hopefully it wont drop more. What you think william?
Okay but please someone help me out Analyze This. We are in 14. 32... This high and low only lasted for a week or so; but is it stays like in 14 it's like a organic growth that corresponds to tue 1 year trade... so you think this can go below 13 right now that it was going so well and a lot of news about it were so good and suddenly everything goes down? I really don't know what to do today is this how I wouldn't happen I would stay long but now I don't know if I should exit today if I'm still on time. I got in at 13.5
"Got pretty scared when we saw 7.10 that i would fall big time but looks like its holding and this is the bottom, just going to have to be real patient the next 3 months"
"Slowly coming back to life, Cheap high flyer tech stock it's still a great Company!"
No real reason as to why the dip today. With positive earning calls and legit SaaS model I believe that this stock will fly! HOLD your stocks and BUY more!
b
Earnings don't jump 50 percent. Will sell off.
We srw going to have to stay longer on this... It was to good tonbe true
"Steve, must be short. this thing is going back to where it was."
Very nice let me ask how many time a virtual assistant pops up when your online. Thats why Im here~
What a joke Zacks is. From a # 1 rank to a #2 last week now a #3. As the stock price dropped. They had a #1 rank on HLTH at 2.50 a share it now sits at 23 cents
Expecting a pop today ? Predictions
big money trying to #$%$ out the little guys right after open... watch this thing pump back up

Was priced at nosebleed levels in anticipation of positive growth. Reduced guidance is bring price closer to reasonable. At $12 is still rich though. Performance and numbers do count.
"Time to ask Mr. Putin for a raise...paid legal fees. Provided by Russia oligarch friend, of course."
Back to $16's soon this time...
nice and steady rise to 16 by the eoy..
"Unreal, the price is being depressed....Under accumulation..."
Nothing drops forever.This is so over sold it's rediculous.Got it at 8.05 and 7.65Not worried.

"I stated it before and will again, I believe this company gets purchased before end of this year. Buyout price in my opinion would be between 25-30."
"Run baby, run."
going back to where it was 6 months ago
They'll beat the street.
Good ER! Hopefully this call gets investors to buy more
TOMORROW 5 BUCKS CRAZY!
"Rising again. Original buy at $3, wish I had more. I was waiting on the drop but never happening."
is it a good idea to buy now? will it keep going up?
they crushed it.....I hope we go to 18-20 by next week.

I bought the chart at $12. I barely even know this company.
I am Long! Is everyone feeling good about the prospects? Raise your hands!
"If like IQ or Huya,,,the first day down is the best day to sell."
I'm still bullish 50
What’d is happening the stock is down 18%
Unbelievable that people are willing to sell so cheap. It will back up to $15 or higher. I strongly expect it will beat the next eps and revenue estimates easily. This will go up further to at least $18's.
Obviously there are no investors here
The stock got ahead of the company is all
Bought some more on yesterdays dip. Should have been more aggressive. That's OK. There will be plenty of time to accumulate shares. This move should extend for several quarters.
going to go up big in the coming weeks.
Gob Bless President Trump!!!! Great American Hero!!!
im at 13.49 and feels like itnot going there any time soon; at least to buy now and cut loses if it goes to 10.What would you do?
"On next earning this should go up I think, right?"
"No investors here too, only shorts and the rest sold"
it is a 9 dollars stock based on my valuation metrics
bullish egain should buy tik tok
When a stock drops 31 % its adios for good bye bye mucus membrane
"Egan has good business metrics, and should be a nice takeover target."
Looks like a Bull Flag to me ? Pile in
buy more
"Does anybody expect a ""beat"" in earnings or am I alone, lol?"
bullish
strong earnings
Great Company! Steal of a price!
"Guess the shorts will win. Can't fight this any longer. Sad, this stock could have yielded some great returns but it is obvious someone wants to lower the value."
FROM 19 TO 7 JUST WOW!
"purchased small amount today, cmon buyout......."
What do you think guys? Can this get to $11 in near future?
LOVE THIS
I must be the last one to know wth is going on....
stock offering down the road no price set but looks like over 12. what do you guys think. ?
"Wow nasdaq -2, egan +14 finally we're getting somewhere"
buy tuesday
Sell this explosive pop of your relatively new to this SO company. Jmo
just a reminder that it pays of in the end to stay long ;-p
Big day today. Any news ok just reaction to Zack’s article today?
Current 11 dollar price = 38% eps growth for the next 5 years. Safety margin is too low. I think 8 dollar is the fair price which = 28% eps growth
"Tough break for a lot today. Stopped at 16. If bounce back to 18 with conviction, I'm back in. Somebody had to sell 200,000 shrs to take profits, or... ""something"" bad coming up. glta"
Great Earnings stock was over sold nice to see the rewards!
"For everyone saying this will sell off, you all are the folks who are just jealous and don’t own a share. I sold just over 1/3 of my shares today which was the cost basis for 95+% of my entire position....how did you fare out Steve?"
This is a Dot.com play from the late 90's it had a stock price of over $700 a share! once in a life time play here to get rich!
Earnings call May 8th
Signs of life. Good price and volume today.
Hope 8.20 is the new support as MACD has crossed over upward. Still early but a signal of EGAN going upward 2 days in a row.
dont miss your chance to be part of great company
it only company growing earnings at 700 percent
boom
Again... the stock makes its biggest move at the end of day on light volume... bigger moves than earlier in the day where the higher volume trades were made. Why? There is not enough downward pressure to create that kind of movement.
