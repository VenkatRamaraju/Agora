"AH price action looks weird. The ER is good and outlook is great, investors will buy during normal trading hours"
Very bad stock!
"Wow nasdaq -2, egan +14 finally we're getting somewhere"
very small float and short covering will propel this stock

"Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter Preliminary Financial ResultsSaaS revenue is expected to be in the range of $15.3 million to $15.5 million, up 32% to 34% year over year.SaaS and professional services revenue are expected to be in the range of $16.9 million to $17.2 million, up 28% to 30% year over year.Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $18.7 million to $19.0 million, up 11% to 13% year over year."
$EGAN has a 1/4th of teums outstanding number of shares with a MC larger than teums today. Maybe a merger would create a market dominant company or maybe one day Egan will buy us out.
Earnings don't jump 50 percent. Will sell off.
Ready to go boom zoom to the moon
they crushed it.....I hope we go to 18-20 by next week.
Egan don't have to worry about a trade war on this one. AI is were the money is flowing. Helping the consumer! Easy to set up. Great numbers with a positive out look. Exactly were the big money wants to be. Look at the volume Big money is buying.
Great quarter! Future looks very bright going forward as well. 
"Got in at 7.70 intially and sold at 7.95 peak yesterday, will try to get back in long at a lower price"
sitting pretty at 7.40
Sigh.. averaged at 8.80.
Relieved to see positive price action today. Modest miss on revenue projections can bring some horrendous price declines in these cloud stocks. CC was good. Company has a solid product. Transition from legacy to SaaS always challenging.
Hammer today. Bullish
Hope short covering will bring it back up to $15's this month.
"Slowly coming back to life, Cheap high flyer tech stock it's still a great Company!"
"im super down now, around 30% I dont know what to do"
buy more
Uh oh!
"Got pretty scared when we saw 7.10 that i would fall big time but looks like its holding and this is the bottom, just going to have to be real patient the next 3 months"
Take profit. This will retrace back to the low 9's today.
"Wow! Great week, I must say."
Egan = no gain. what's up with that. trades up and closes at low then trades up and them closes at low etc all week long.
bu
What do you think guys? Can this get to $11 in near future?
Big day today. Any news ok just reaction to Zack’s article today?
Many stocks I would sell after such a run up. This one I'm hanging on to.
https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/18/10/g12490517/altitude-software-enhances-its-xperience-suite-with-egain-ai-and-knowl
"purchased small amount today, cmon buyout......."
"Ya go figure , we were at $15 a week ago and there has been no bad news."
"just going off the financials I briefly looked at, looks like a no brainer to get in"
Zacks has eGain as a strong buy!!
"Steve, must be short. this thing is going back to where it was."
dont worry about ah tomorrow will be up-glta
"I stated it before and will again, I believe this company gets purchased before end of this year. Buyout price in my opinion would be between 25-30."
Was priced at nosebleed levels in anticipation of positive growth. Reduced guidance is bring price closer to reasonable. At $12 is still rich though. Performance and numbers do count.
"Strong support today, it will start ramping UP next week. I expect $16's before Christmas."
Nothing drops forever.This is so over sold it's rediculous.Got it at 8.05 and 7.65Not worried.
bullish egain should buy tik tok
Any shorts not covered here are in for a hurtin’! Time to cover snd go long or feel the squeeeeeeeeze.
I guess one will have to wait for the Q1 results unless the company changes the guidance. I don't understand much the reason for selling pressure below 11...just riding the market weakness? Any thoughts?
its getting ready to make a nother step up is howits looking
guess this is just the overall market
it will be positive before 1030.
Earning is tomorrow what is expected here?
The puppet master is controlling this one.... has not moved from a 20 cent range all day on 10x the normal volume and growing.
Way over sold now great buy here..
"LOW VOLUME the last 4 trading days. No CONFORMATION.The 10 day avg. is 1.2M and today, with just an hour and change until the close, we are 629K. no mass selling the last 4 trading days.Yahoo uses the 3 month avg. which is 457K but why would you want to use that when the stock was closing at 100k or less 3 months ago. The 10 day avg. is 2 weeks of trading and that is a better indicator of what is happening now with closes over 1M.Bottom line without VOLUME there is no need to panic."
"EGAN is a value here compared to ZEN, NOW, & HUBS. Yet this market keeps rewarding companies without earnings.....by current valuations, it would seem the market is telling EGAN to spend more on acquisitive growth and run deficits to put up a big top line growth number.....but any kind of earnings makes you subject to the PEG valuation metrics. The company has a strong balance sheet, LiveChat Software (LVC: PW) trades in Poland, is debt free, and has a trailing P/E of 16.....maybe these two fiscally conservative CRM companies could merge and give the bigger debt-fueled CRM companies a run for their money."
is it a good idea to buy now? will it keep going up?
What a hidden gem
What is happening?
It's time to climb ...
Beautiful drop. Caught that one holding short from 12.15. Cheers.
The stock got ahead of the company is all
Who is shaking my tree?
Good stock to short??
"Here's how I see it.....The last quarter ended 6/20/18 and will be released 9/5/18.It has been over 2 weeks since the books were closed on last quarter and they have at least a ""ballpark "" idea as to what the final results for last quarter were.My guess is they may be short of expectations and we will be the last to know.We need to show a profit. The B/V is a NEGATIVE ( 0.34) which shows up in the balance sheet as only 39M in ASSETs VS 49M in LIABILITIES, not a good sign unless you are BK. that's not to say we are going BK, we are not."
EGAN needs more exposure. Need a bigger brokerage house to cover them. They make money. Growing at 30%+ with no debt and $30 million in cash. It’s a gem waiting to be discovered
Bought in at 7.90 I really like the outlook of this company going into 2019
"The reason for the panic selling over the past week or so is bizarre, considering the earnings report basically met expectations and even just a few days ago an analyst upgraded Egain to a 'strong buy', with several other analysts having a 'buy' recommendation as well. https://www.baseballdailydigest.com/2018/09/11/egain-egan-upgraded-by-bidaskclub-to-strong-buy.html"
Unbelievable that people are willing to sell so cheap. It will back up to $15 or higher. I strongly expect it will beat the next eps and revenue estimates easily. This will go up further to at least $18's.
"Analyst Actions: Needham Adjusts eGain's Price Target to $15 From $16, Keeps at Buy"
Earnings today?
"Great report, impressive! Beat both EPS and REVENUE. EPS: 6c vs 1c estimates, Revenue: $19.2M vs $18.47M estimates....Go UP tomorrow to $15's. GL LONGS."
be careful shorting. this is going to 20+.
I sure hope we can build on the gains. Shares have hard a hard time holding gains. Big volume makes me feel optimistic there may be more gas in the tank.
Looks like a Bull Flag to me ? Pile in
"Tough break for a lot today. Stopped at 16. If bounce back to 18 with conviction, I'm back in. Somebody had to sell 200,000 shrs to take profits, or... ""something"" bad coming up. glta"
Current 11 dollar price = 38% eps growth for the next 5 years. Safety margin is too low. I think 8 dollar is the fair price which = 28% eps growth
"Loss of customers disclosed on last CC undermining the shares. A one off, or indicative of limitations of the platform? Anyone have any actual experience with the product?"
Expecting a pop today ? Predictions
Good ER! Hopefully this call gets investors to buy more
Is it gonna run further?
Pretty stout since earnings.
I am Long! Is everyone feeling good about the prospects? Raise your hands!
Let your winners run
10 days RED
OTP Bank Selects eGain’s Knowledge Management for Customer Servicehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/otp-bank-selects-egain-knowledge-103000102.html
it is a 9 dollars stock based on my valuation metrics
What’d is happening the stock is down 18%
"Sold 10% of my position at 16 today, which were bought at 8 several years ago. Bunch at 3.45 that I am letting ride for a while longer."
I bought the chart at $12. I barely even know this company.
"If like IQ or Huya,,,the first day down is the best day to sell."
"I’ve always liked the stock and it’s prospects, but for whatever reason, it never seems to get the attention it deserves."
im gonna place an order at 7.15 o 7.20Hopefully it wont drop more. What you think william?
tomorrow should be up 13.50-14
on the move to 12s..
"yet again, a nearly 5% drop on a day where there is less than 60,000 shares traded. so few shares and trades should not create a 5% impact. just sayin..."
going back to where it was 6 months ago
"Looks like 7.20 is the floor, crazy stock this one is"
big money trying to #$%$ out the little guys right after open... watch this thing pump back up
may break 16.00 this week then on up from there to new highs
stock offering down the road no price set but looks like over 12. what do you guys think. ?
Bought some more on yesterdays dip. Should have been more aggressive. That's OK. There will be plenty of time to accumulate shares. This move should extend for several quarters.
WTH happened with the earnings?
"NEW 52WK HIGH TODAY $19.05Could be some STOP-LOSS,Could be time for a stock offering they like to do near the 52WK High.NO SEC Filings."
A Cloud company with EARNINGS. way undervalued market cap. See PLAN for losses and MC comparison for example. DOMO another one to compare with losses. EGAN should easily be back to highs imo.
It should go higher short term...$12's....
"MACD Crossover any day, better get in for quick pop to 9 or 10"
12 dollar
I see 20 in a week on this one.
Any news and it's off to the races $35 dollar target
Hope 8.20 is the new support as MACD has crossed over upward. Still early but a signal of EGAN going upward 2 days in a row.
in a few days you will be looking at 100%
I got eGain at $10.07. this company has momentum and slowly growing to reach its potential
"Price usually goes down just ahead of quarterly earnings to gather more investors. Similarly to SFIX, AAPL, CGC, etc... I predict quarter earnings beat."
The gap at $14.97 from 11/10 to 11/11 will be filled eventually. 30 day rule after 12/11 will work well when fund managers bought back in again...Mark this post.
FROM 19 TO 7 JUST WOW!
Red day after day! wonder how many bagholders we got
No real reason as to why the dip today. With positive earning calls and legit SaaS model I believe that this stock will fly! HOLD your stocks and BUY more!
"Rising again. Original buy at $3, wish I had more. I was waiting on the drop but never happening."
We srw going to have to stay longer on this... It was to good tonbe true
TEUM will be next!
"Guys, don't panic, for me this stock drop was also surprise, but, it is good point for buy. If earning expectation for the next quarter were get lowered, it means in next report they easily can beat estimates, and will be good uptrend. and this without vaccine, imagine the uptrend when the vaccine will be around. All the latest earnings were beaten solidly by $EGAN. I think we need patient, what do you think?"
Riding this baby out.... It will overcome this.
"It is really strange market, the report was good (actually all the recent reports of $EGAN were good)Why it was down on after hours trading? Can someone explain?"
bullish 20
"Time to ask Mr. Putin for a raise...paid legal fees. Provided by Russia oligarch friend, of course."
Day traders are converging on this stock and playing it . They bring no value and only want to pick your pockets.
strong earnings
"Big down day in,,,greater than twice normal volume."
This is a Dot.com play from the late 90's it had a stock price of over $700 a share! once in a life time play here to get rich!
nice and steady rise to 16 by the eoy..
going to go up big in the coming weeks.
"AI,KM, nice recovery."
When will earning be reported and do you think it will be positive net profit this time? Vote up or down on profit.
Egan showing strength close on the high with Nice volume
https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/339984/why-egain-egan-could-be-an-impressive-growth-stock
its a crapshoot with regards to dec quarter but based on everything disclosed seems like momentum is strong so at the least I think they might announce solid outlook. see my previous analysis below.https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/48947357-robo-investor/5184205-egain-investment-thesis-march-2018
"might fall, but will prob rise to $20 eventually over next couple months."
"Profitable, Guiding higher ! This Cloud company on fire and Market Cap could quadruple imo, since similar companies lose money and have huge MCs."
"Terrible guidance. Even after this drop, stock is still up 55%. Was way overpriced, but I do find it humorous listening to people unable to figure out why it dropped. You shouldn't be trading"
buy tuesday
Unbelievable

please remove this kind of garbage off wall street
boom
Conference presentation today. Apparently they have good things to say. Not a moment too soon
"Egan has good business metrics, and should be a nice takeover target."
bullish 50
Okay but please someone help me out Analyze This. We are in 14. 32... This high and low only lasted for a week or so; but is it stays like in 14 it's like a organic growth that corresponds to tue 1 year trade... so you think this can go below 13 right now that it was going so well and a lot of news about it were so good and suddenly everything goes down? I really don't know what to do today is this how I wouldn't happen I would stay long but now I don't know if I should exit today if I'm still on time. I got in at 13.5
"For everyone saying this will sell off, you all are the folks who are just jealous and don’t own a share. I sold just over 1/3 of my shares today which was the cost basis for 95+% of my entire position....how did you fare out Steve?"
bullish 25
EGAN STOCK 12
Selling is over.With only a few min. to trade the VOLUME is 1.31M vs a 10 day ave. of 1.26MWe should be OK tomorrow.
"not a bad earnings report, it will recover, give it a couple of days"
"Does anybody expect a ""beat"" in earnings or am I alone, lol?"
Anyone now when earnings will be reported? Nothing on their website- but it should be soon.
Guidance for upcoming quarter was light. Gratifying to see us grind higher after a soft open. For SaaS stocks it can be the kiss of death. A testament to their great product.
beat !!!
Anybody here can share his thoughts about earnings report? Is it after market or before market hours?
WHERE IS THE BOTTOM 2 BUCKS?
"Guys, does it work entering at this price?"
Good ER we'll be looking at $24.
"7 weeks after liftoff a stock will revisit its 50 EMA. I bought today as a first timer at 12.40, the exact moment it hit the magic line. Not worried!"
"Question. I have been in and out of this stock for awhile, after earnings it always drops significantly.This time, they pre-released earnings, not sure why? Maybe there is a big announcement/buyout coming on the call this afternoon? I don't have a ton of shares in this company but I am up and I try to never let a profit turn into a loss. Just would like to get some feedback on what people are thinking today and if you are holding or selling before close.Remember, this stock has a pe of around 75 or so? so even if a buyout, how much higher could it really go?"
"Earnings will be BEAT, IT WILL GO UP TO $16'S like last time."
"Hope the report will be ok. Good luck to all. I am just staying in the side lines...have been burned playing earnings lately. VIPS, SOL, LCI, ZM, etc. were down with good report."
"No investors here too, only shorts and the rest sold"
We are breaking out! Nice!
Sorry for your loss but i have said many times this company is garbage. Doesn’t belong in wall street. Not worth a dime to invest
Bought at the dip earlier and will hold for $$
"All, Steve is a habitual short-seller based on his comments. Take a look at his other posts, Coty, Egan, many others. @steve, sorry bruh, didn’t fare out as good as the rest of us on this one...."
"Unreal, the price is being depressed....Under accumulation..."
Great Earnings stock was over sold nice to see the rewards!
"I really don't understand this stock. I know it is lightly traded. I know it had a bit of a run up before earnings. But, the company continues to churn out positive earnings and beating estimates, and it still cannot gain any traction. Last year, this thing skyrocketed on earnings. Since then, it continues to drop every time they report solid earnings and growth. Makes no sense."
$14's soon....
This stock drops 8 trading days in the row.
"Does anyone know why the CFO has cut his shares in half since the first of the year, this has always troubled me ?"
Again... the stock makes its biggest move at the end of day on light volume... bigger moves than earlier in the day where the higher volume trades were made. Why? There is not enough downward pressure to create that kind of movement.
"Are we all BLIND? Take a look at the market today? All HOT GREEN, and EGAN is still RED????????????Are EGAN longs Dum' and Dum'r here?"
congrats longs
Up we go
will this one go back 15s this week?
Back to $16's soon this time...
im at 13.49 and feels like itnot going there any time soon; at least to buy now and cut loses if it goes to 10.What would you do?
"Sorry Robinhoods, your lesson is being learned"
"This is madness. Company beat expectations handily and said, full year subscription revs (90% of total revs) would ""come in at the high end of previously announced guidance."" Meanwhile, operating profit margins went from 2% a year ago to 10% in the quarter they just reported. Operating cash flow went from $200k last year to $3.8m in the March quarter. Oh, and they fully paid off all their debt in the quarter.You don't want to believe Nasdaq stocks get manipulated by their market makers and then this #&Y$(&Q* happens."
"On next earning this should go up I think, right?"
this is going to run up..
Congratulations. It broke the streak.
16 dollars
IT'S GREEN for once
Great Company! Steal of a price!
bullish
Anyone listening to the call?
"Actually we're all good. The charts say, end of June-first wk of July were the anomaly. Now, we are back to normal! I'm not waiting for a confirmation @ $16-17, the moving avgs/trend line confirm, time to buy is now!"
"Beat earning and revenue expectation, drop 30% is a very good buy."
buyout
Signs of life. Good price and volume today.
I must be the last one to know wth is going on....
dont miss your chance to be part of great company
bullish 16
"This run up is pretty satisfying. Since 2015, I have bought shares between 3.45 and 15. Nice to see the ALL green again!"
there's a reason analysts are giving this a 100% buy rating and a 1.9 buy rating on yahoo
"Seems inexpensive in SaaS space. Profitable. Share price seems to low, even with modest rate of growth."
What is the news and why the up when all is sooo down?
yup. not a bad print. YoY saas up 40%
What a joke Zacks is. From a # 1 rank to a #2 last week now a #3. As the stock price dropped. They had a #1 rank on HLTH at 2.50 a share it now sits at 23 cents
Solid earnings
Hopefully this is the rebound
"I read the earnings report a couple of times. Honestly, I liked what I read. This is such an overreaction!"
They are making money..
Earnings should be announced next week.
I like it!
Dilution? Any explanation?
Obviously there are no investors here
"Been watching this one for a while, is this a good time to buy in?"
