Why did I sell shares at 129.5? Why why why?
"@SdDavid, if you really work at tandem as you claim and if tandem if tandem is ahead in innovation and technology and quality, then please explain why the t connect app presumably a precursor to the controller app so important to tsport and the new product pipeline is getting such poor reviews in the play store? Users are complaining about the app. How do you expect the controller app to be approved with so many issues? And why is your 5 year plan has now become a 10 year plan?"
"Its ok folks, wait a few weeks for earnings, and lets just say, that i know estimates will be crushed, by at least 50%. Just like i said last time, that it would be crushed by more than 100% and turn profit, and lets just say from working in company i am never wrong. LoL The best healthcare stock to own, I'm selling when it hits 400 in a few years, and retiring."
"Sept 11, 2020 - [small] Clinical study (NCT04545567), ""A randomized cross-over trial assessing glycemic responses to two different approaches to insulin dosing for carbohydrate ingestion (announced vs. unannounced), with two different AP systems (RocketAP vs. USS Virginia, aka Control-IQ, in random order)""Sept 24, 2020 - Dexcom press release announcing a five-year collaboration with the University of Virginia. Purpose to expand on Dexcom's automated insulin delivery technology as well as to refine and pilot in a series of clinical trials, Dexcom's next generation closed loop algorithms.Jan 18, 2021 - Mentioned study completed.June 7, 2021 - Study results released. Diatribe dot org discusses in detail. Participants used Tandem pumps and Dexcom G6 (as if that was not obvious from the start), Results described as impressive. Unannounced meals TIR 83%. Announced meals TIR 100%. Overnight TIR 99%. Overall TIR 87%.Aug 15, 2021 - Further results published. Results: Time in range (TIR) and time in tight range (TTR) were significantly higher with no increase in time below range (TBR) coupled with ~ 9% less insulin delivered. Conclusion: ""A new fully automated CLC system with automatic prandial dosing was proven to be safe and feasible and outperformed our legacy USS-Virginia in an adolescent population with and without meal announcement.""Next logical step would be a larger pivotal study. Looking for that......"
"yeah everyone in the company is just giddy, how could the analyst be off , by so much, and have no clue, of the upcoming earnings destruction about to happen. lolall aboard 400 in 2024, and im not joking, at least."
"Been working for tndm for few years now, not sure why like to lowball this much, but im pretty confident, each quarter estimate for years to come, will be absolutely crushed, no stock with better fundamentals, and with absolutely no competition. Im very confident 400 dollars a share in 2024, this is what MSFT, was in lates 1980's, in a few years, with the ABBOTT/DEXCOM alliance, total domination, of the world market. It doesnt really matter at this point, but Medtronic, who is no longer relevant, or PODD, with their crushing debt, and light years behind in innovation, technology, quality, just no way to compete, so in few years, once these and other companies realize no way to compete, just going to leave the pump market. This is just free money, invest in tndm now, and in 10 years be a multi millionaire"
"getting excited, few more weeks, and people will be in will be shocked, how badly TNDM crushes the estimates, all aboard 400 in 2024, im 10k long, the most passionate believer in TNDM on this board, of course it doesn't hurt, working for company, and knowing how estimates greatly sandbagged. lol moving forward, crush each one by at least 50%, and 4th quarter by 100%. The best pumpmaker in the world, and , no competion, just keeps taking massive market share each quarter. How long before Medtronic, and PODD with massive debt goes out of business."
Volume indicates simple profit taking but I'm holding till $200 till I part with ANY more of my tandem stock held since sub $3. I bought this on the advice of a diabetic that said this was the best device he has ever used for his diabetes management. Thought I was doing well selling 1K shares at $5. OOOOH the pain!
"Medtronic is in ""advanced negotiations"" to purchase a start-up insulin patch company, ""Triple Jump"" for $300M . Widely acknowledged (outside of the Medtronic oxygen deprived upper executive chambers) is that the Medtronic cgm sensor which drives their automated approaches is no good.Tandem has the best pump (X2) on the market with the best algorithm (Control-IQ) paired with the best sensor (Dexcom).Medtronic is thrashing about blindly trying to figure out what happened and how to fix it. Medtronic seems to discount that consumers are smart and talk among themselves and will ultimately choose the best solution.Waiting on FDA approvals for the Tandem remote bolus app, the Dexcom G7 and the Abbott FreeStyle libre. Note that the Libre needs an FDA labeling change that allows it to be connected to an automated insulin delivery system before Tandem is able to integrate with the Libre which imho will be a huge boost particularly for international.I remain long with TNDM."
anyone think TNDM is a great acquisition target by one of the big boys?
"New long term high - ha! We're in r1, or the first level of resistance above, and in the upper range of this resistance. It's somewhat focused, as seen on the LT chart in the first of of 2015. R2 is in the summer of 2014 in the ~ 165 area. Once it's broke, things will happ[en fast. But first things first, and we'll see what happens with the upcoming er, and r1 However, the street is optimistic Be happy.... gl...."
"Tandem has a successful history of innovation and problem solving. The issues that customers are experiencing are small compared to the accomplishments they have achieved. No doubts about their capabilities. When these issues are settled and reviews are positive, fda approval will follow. To the moon we go!!"
"With Dexcom having a great quarter how will that affect TNDM, positively or negatively?"
"Next week (Nov 3 - Earnings), I would love to hear the Tandem CFO raise the high end of the FY21 revenue guidance over $700 M which would be 40% growth over FY20.That might be a bit overly optimistic. But it would be nice !!!Revised FY21 guidance on Aug 4, '21 @ $670M ~ $685MRevised FY21 guidance on May 5, '21 @ $625M ~ $640MInitial FY21 guidance issued on Feb 24, '21 @ $600M ~ $615MNote that FY20 actual revenue was $499M"
"Just next week, and peoples jaws will drop, by how much, estimate is crushed, not going to be any quarter for a long, long time, when estimates not crushed by at LEAST 50% in few years, here in company,know have no competition, taking huge share from medtromic and PODD each quarter, and fo fully expect in year or two for them to drop out of the pump market, no way you compete against tndm, just light years ahead on innovation and technology. PODD can't even meet quarterly estimates, and saddled with huge debt, close to a billion dollar. If you break down the fundamentals, can clearly see, that TNDM is way superior in every category, by next year, Tndm share price will easily pass up PODD. Anyway i would advise anyone to hop on the TNDM train while you gave a chance, after earnings, it will never be below 130 again."
awaiting comments from @Furry after dexcom results today
"Your wish is my command furry, revenue guidance will be over 700 million, lets just say, heard it from a little bird lolgrowth over 40% y/y, very easy to do when have no competition, Tndm has and will become more dominant, each quarter, complete domination of the world pump market, in 5 years, this is the Microsoft, and Tesla in its infancy."
"Loving this run, but how long can it last before taking another 10% breather?...."
And I think TNDM just hit a new high ?Rolling upwards !!!!!
