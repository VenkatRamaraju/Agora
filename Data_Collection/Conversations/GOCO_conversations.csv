"@Johnny7321..923.......you do know that Insiders are Buying, not 'cashing out'. Some 6 weeks ago, 9 of the Insiders, Directors and Officers, collectively bought 831,000 shares around $4.67. What's that tell you?? I know what it tells me. Yes, 831K shares bought this current Q3 ! And after more than a 50% drop in price from some $9....."
Will recover sooner than you think
Today is the last day of Q3....Buckle-up !
I bought 100 shares at $4.95 this morning which brought my average cost down to $9.225. I am wishing and hoping for a spike to $10-$11 so I can get out in the green.
What’s wrong??
"Again, 9 Insiders, not 1 or 2, or 5 or 8, collectively bought 831,000 shares some 3 weeks ago for almost $4 million. Enough said. Load up on today's gift."
Are we touching double digits next month?
Let’s go back to double digits!!
