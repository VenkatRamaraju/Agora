"In with 3K quantities @4.35 , Its pretty over sold at this price .."
5 here we come
"CEO and CFO sold 120,000 shares yesterday. This may continue to weight on the stock price. Last insider buying was in March, 2020 at $0.84 per share. Board member and execs have only been selling since March , 2020, but they also get shares as compensation. Most stocks in the “digital health” investment area has been declining meaningfully lately, it’s not just CSLT. Look at the charts of $TDOC $AMWL $SHCR $ACCD $GOCO since February. They are not pretty. Also, small caps in general have been week recently."
Are you a day trader? Then you need to check out (http://trademarketview.tech). Their daily watchlists are highly researched and take note of the latest stock market news. A must for any investor!
GOCO seems to fix the issues and will now go back slowly to the levels it came from. Need a little bit patience. But in 2 months time the future looks good! Expect around 6-7 very soon!
"Again, 9 Insiders collectively bought 831,000 shares for a $4.68 average a couple of weeks ago. I don't know what else you need to know after falling more than 40% some 5 weeks ago. A no-brainer."
"What's the problem with this company? The 4th quarter and fiscal 2020 report looks promising. I bought GOCO on 01-29-2021 at $13.50. The one year estimate is $19.70 and the 52 week high is $26.25. Great upside potential and this company has been in business since 2001, but it seems stagnant."
@bigsky...yup. Only 42% of the 10-Day Average with just 2.75 of the regular market day remaining.
"Update: Source TD Ameritrade: Up Over 15%, on Track for Record Percent Increase -- Data Talk12:03 pm ET August 16, 2021 (Dow Jones) PrintGoHealth Inc Class A (GOCO) is currently at $4.70, up $0.64 or 15.6% -- Would be largest percent increase on record (Based on available data back to July 15, 2020)-- Snaps a five day losing streak-- Down 46.53% month-to-date-- Down 65.56% year-to-date-- Down 78.59% from its all-time closing high of $21.98 on July 22, 2020-- Down 75.48% from 52 weeks ago (Aug. 17, 2020), when it closed at $19.19-- Down 75.48% from its 52-week closing high of $19.19 on Aug. 17, 2020-- Up 15.6% from its 52-week closing low of $4.07 on Aug. 13, 2021"

"I go with Insiders and the research firms. Latest cumulative ratings? BUYHere's today's current score: Equity Summary Score 4 Firms† | Methodology, 08/26/21 Bullish -"
Good move getting involved with Aunt Bertha.
The folks selling today are not long term investors - they are folks that wanted to make fast money on earnings trading momentum. Hold strong and you will be rewarded
GoHealth is down 23.17% to 6.30
Let's break 5
Is GOCO worst IPO in the last 10 years? Raum Emanuel is on the board and big shareholder - figures

Bank of America rated this yesterday as a BUY...go read the reports
"@Patrick...I'm in rotation. In this cycle, I've been Buying. Down 6.5% while Insiders bought 831,000 shares above the current price. A no-brainer here."
Tuesday morning - will reach 5.50 - and get back to low 5s. Great fast recovery. Great buy at current price.
"You pay attention when 9 Insiders cumulatively BUY 831,000 shares of GOCO the week of August 16th....."
CEO and CSO buy 522k shares worth 2.4 Million after hours today.
Anyone else notice the 474K share Buy at 4:30pm yesterday? Anyone question the great Q2 ER next week? Buckle-Up!

Monster call buying Oct $7.50s
"Brandon and Clint - both bought shares recently. Also, an entity called NVX Holdings bought shares recently. There are corresponding SEC filings. This is awesome validation that the stock is trading too low."
Past one year its just being falling.
"What's going on? Can anyone explain how an ok ER turns a stock 43% dropped in 1 day? What I saw is a net loss of $39M, which is not that much for a $3B business. In fact there are many positive growth in revenue compared with previous year, as they project a net revenue outlook of $1.2B-$1.3B. I really don't understand what happened today."
Will be back up in a week solid health insurance company !!
Today is the last day of Q3....Buckle-up !
Any guesses as to what day this week GOCO will hit a new 52 week low ? The current low is 15.14. My guess is Wednesday.
$6.00 once Democrats spend the money helathcare will be golden!!!! GOCO GoHealth!She'll be prettey soon!! $7- $10 lmao!!! look SLQT select quote rannnnnnn~
I see they had a massive loss but that was enough to tank the stock over 40% seems like a huge overreaction. clover health is new competition for this company
Am I by myself in this chat room? Nice comeback right before close! Happy holiday!
Another quarter of losses? Glad to see the stock trading for what I said it was worth....5
"$18.90 is the updated average price target. Given current price, I do not get the Zacks strong sell reporting today. In clear support of short sellers. Seems over sold and buying opportunity for others. GLTA."
hopefully when this swings I am not down 50% before that happen. I do think it will reverse.
Im in...wont stay this low
Add more
Shorts overkilled this stock and speculating $6. It has far better earnings than EHTH and far better User Interface. Soon we will see $15 in it.
"And again, a nice strong close! Soon we be closing that gap to 7 if not 8!"
"Isee really good potential for this stock now due to the current political results. As much as I dont like them, gotta do things to make myself money. Marketwatch has featured this stock as top 20 value stock yesterday in story. Also being that it is based in Chicago, has people close to Biden, in healthcare, and dealing with Medicare Advantage.....the stock has been on the move since Nov 3. We will be seeing $26 and beyond. Thats the way politics works and I will make it pay for me."
Second quarter 2021 net loss of $39.2 million compared to a net loss of $22.9 million in the prior year period
"@Anonymous = Spewing Short. Insiders are Buying for gains to come, not to short their own company. Get real. This stock is down 50% with a couple of weeks. The company is loaded with many agents now. Our Baby boomers are here, myself included. Medicare Advantage will only grow and grow."

GoCO gohealth will go Loco $10 double the money here CEO already bought his shares @50% discount!
Company headquarters abandoned and liquidation is immenant. That's how it's trading.

"The lowest low of the PPS happened before the election. Since then its been up and up. This earnings report gave it time to reset and now the newest lowest low is about $10.95. Now with open enrollment here for Medicare and the Advantage plans, we are going to see this stock resume its upward movement. If you cant understand this movement....maybe you should go invest somewhere else."
"Go buy GOTU, easy double by month end"
Next $$$6
Keep an eye on that 13.16 last Friday low -- if that holds we could be up for a bounce to the high teens next month with a whole new price range...
"$6.00 again and then $7.00 as I stated before. GOCO will earn as democrats spending bill and healthcare.Or goco could be bought out by UNH, Cigna, etc."
"why its happend to me , whenever buy stock at lowest point , it goes more low , is thr anything we can control drop point"
Back to 6!
Come On Already!
Running $6.00 forghettabble it! Then $7.00! GOCO Good to go!
"I just quadrupled my position here, now average down to $5.9. Watching this for 2 years."
Rev and ee's up nicely; way oversold IMHO...if you add back the options cost/payout.....positive net ee's 34M....those were one-time costs :) I'd look for a bounce up in next couple of days. the rev growth is great IMHO
Medicare open enrollment this year is coming up. Insiders know this.
what is happening?
buy out target
This one will be a huge catalyst for my bank balance : Also pick up some KPLT guys
Why dropping??
So Rahm Emanuel resigned from the BOD to become the Ambassador to Japan...hahahah oh boy.
In at $23 but not worried at all. This is just the beginning
Big thumbs up to everyone that didn't panic sell and even bought more at 10...
KneW I should of dumped at $5
"Loaded up. Too good to pass up. Hopefully it will go up at some point of time - whether it is days, weeks or months. If it continues to stay at this level for a very long time, it may indicate that the stock market has lost all rationality."
"A gift here. I've been loading up under $5.40...Again, 9 insiders bought 831,000 shares at market price a month ago. The selling season with open enrollment is coming. Many agents are trained. This is a gift now. A no-brainer."
$4.00 under then $2.00 by tax loss selling season!
Insiders are buying like crazy! $26 to $5 is a mirage!
Insiders don't load-up to lose $$. It's a no brainer here. This stock was over $9 only 2.5 weeks ago.
These MM can shake the tree all they want. I've been picking-up the fruit.
https://discord.gg/ejAhjmn
Tip of the year: Mike14 days agoGOCO reached a new 52-Week Low today. Anyone not loading today is missing out !
I bought GOCO on 01-29-2021 when it plunged to $13.31. I've been a bag holder at $13.50 ever since. What's wrong with this company? It's been around since 2001.
35% pop needed from here just to get back to IPO price after earnings. What's the likelihood of that happening?
"Pretty certain there is a lot of accumulation taking place at these levels, close to lift off!"

"Shorts at work, I'm buying the dip and holding long."
is this china stock? whats hapening
Down -1.8% on no volume. Literally nil to none.
Interesting that GOCO bounced right off of its low IPO price target range of 18.00
These guys take the cake as worst run company ever. It’s very difficult to lose 43% of your market cap in one day with zero bounce. 
"Hey folks, there is a great opportunity in $SHIP. massive 10% share buy-back is about to happen, come and pick discounted price and wait for Q3 surge to 100% gain!Not pumper, just want to spread great news in case you haven't come across this yet"
GoHealth is up 10.47% to 5.17
Market will correct and this thing $3.50 $2.00 YUPPP
$6.00 once Democrats spend the money helathcare will be golden!!!! GOCO GoHealth!
GOCO no go will get $4.00 under soon again!
$6.00 next stop it will form base around upper $5's and then $6 in next days or so! Then back to $8.00+
Results weren't bad. And one of the few companies to actually provide forward guidance in a challenging year.
Should rename gohell instead of go health
Be greedy when people are fearful. Way cheap. This should bounce back to $8 in a month.
Decided to buy some March 2022 strike $5.00 today. Put a bid in at .85 and it filled at the close. Hopefully by then management has been replaced.
I am pretty sure this will be over 6.00 to 8.00 in the next few months.
Lets hope close green
What is a fair value for you guys?
my order went through at 4.6 this morning. Yeeeeee
Does anyone know anyone that works at GOCO? What the inside story here?
"GOCO will reverse slowly, if you can afford keeping it for 2-3 months you'll easily see the price around $8-9"
"There is little one can do during this period when it keeps dropping on no news. Good bookrunners would have lined up some post-IPO support to stabilize the stock price (other funds willing to buy). Other than possible manipulation to tank the stock price before analyst upgrades, it is hard to speculate why it's falling so precipitously."
I bought 100 shares at $4.95 this morning which brought my average cost down to $9.225. I am wishing and hoping for a spike to $10-$11 so I can get out in the green.
Next stop is $6!
Started buying it. Most probably it'll go down more and I'll average down at 4.50-4.25-4.05 if it goes down. There's a high likelyhood it'll reverse around 4. In 1 month time I expect $6-7
I bought more at yesterdays close; only because I've seen over reaction dumps before. Today we'll end up over $5 per share. If it is nothing more than 'shorts buy back on Fridays'. My original buy was after the IPO at $24.02 so what do I know.
Strong hold. This will be a bagger soon. Was beaten up too much .
any minute it's gonna jump?
"Listened to CC and they seem competent and executing a strategy to make 2022 profitable. No cash raise needed. Cash burn associated with agent training, marketing, and other smart spending. Should get a bounce."
shorts covered
"I'm long with GOCO, MPLN, and CLOV. It seems Wall Street simply does not these types of companies?"
"$26 to $4 because no one believes the story. Small government controlled commissions and lots of churn, could go below $1 and SLQT will follow."
Anyone here this board is so quite
Big buying at 4.91....here it comes
upgrades coming. 30+
Does anybody know how many shares were shorted in the last two days?
@Anonymous...it's Holding and some. Up 3.7%
Waiting for low 4s before I average down.

"When Insiders and 10% Beneficiaries are buying up hundreds of thousands of shares within the last few days, it's time to pay attention and load up."
now buying advertising for investors....just saw a commercial on CNBC
Goco keeps moving up and continues to impress me and even during a somewhat red market day overall Go Health is still up in green 4%. When a company does the right things and the stock is moving in this way it makes the investment worthwhile.
"$7.00 very soon $5.46 was reached! $5.17, next stop $6.00, Medicare and health bill will make GOCO some money!! Look at SLQT rose from $7.75 now $10.20!!!!"
"I'm long at $13.50 with 100 shares. In other words, *WAY* underwater. I'm probably going to average down at this point, somewhere in the $4.00 - $5.00 range and hope GOCO can spike to $10 so I can escape with some green. I really think long term GOCO is probably going to get bought out which should be good for longs. In the short term I think Clover Heath is going eat GOCO alive."
Let’s break $5
I'm buying as much as possible tomorrow! Will jump up 20% by close Friday. Super bullish!!!
Towards $6 this week!
Wow! The most unfortunate ipo’d stock ever. Still better than GNUS though. I’ve been just eyeing on goco since its ipo to see how bad it can be. Feel so sorry…
Retail will never make money on this stock. This company is majority owned by the private equity firm that orchestrated the IPO and installed the new management team. They are washing out all retail shareholders till the give up. If you do not need the money hold for at least 2-3 yrs and you will break even. This is not a stock for get rich trading.
Off of market session lows. Buyers will be back for bargains like GOCO. $5.18 was a steal now.
"This company has invested heavily for growth, this is why its EBITDA is down 47%. Its not like its a dud and it collapsed 47% it invested using its own resources from its own pocket in itself, the cheapest source of funding there is, how nice to not need a loan. It costs money to invest in yourself, thats the drop in ebitda but you are only transforming your wealth from one form to another. Algorithims run the investment industry today ... this company has been red flagged in a mainframe somewhere. No qualitative or human interaction was involved in this decision ... a sell switch was flipped to 'sell'. I'm very bullish and have just bought some at $4.39"
Curious about Enterprise value of GOCO. This appears to be the same basic business model at SLQT. What does it mean that GOCO is half the revenue of SLQT while having slightly greater Enterprise value (>$4B vs SLQT just under $4B)? Is SLQT undervalued? Is GOCO fairly - or overvalued? Any thoughts are appreciated!
I bet it’ll all workout in the end :)
"@Anonymous...it's not on the Selling side. It's on the Buying side. That's why the price is up. And the Volume? It's 150% of the 90-Day Average. The trend is obvious. Anymore Shorting, and I'll be your Buyer....along with Insiders."
"I see big loss by the shorts because this stock has amazing fundamentals and Financials. I'm making profit now, bought a lot at 9s"

"@Johnny7321..923.......you do know that Insiders are Buying, not 'cashing out'. Some 6 weeks ago, 9 of the Insiders, Directors and Officers, collectively bought 831,000 shares around $4.67. What's that tell you?? I know what it tells me. Yes, 831K shares bought this current Q3 ! And after more than a 50% drop in price from some $9....."
"I'm more focused on bigger fish, although in here at $13.50 and 100 shares which blows. I should have loaded up at the 52 week low and hoped for a pop into the green on my average and get the hell of of this dog."
It will a upside surprise $30+
"Hello? That 474,500 share purchase at 4:30pm yesterday in AH was more than 50% of the 10-Day Average Volume. Hello?"
After all the COVID things all the health care stock will be 
@Ultee...rather here we go.
"Reddits,WSB,RobinHoodies this stock is unfairly targeted no way GoHealth is a short or it can't be a good money maker. It insures older folks on Medicare, Medicaid, and helps young individuals find affordable health insurance in the market place DOMINATED by the biggies like AETNA, CIGNA, UNiTEDhealth, Humana, BlueCross, CVSNo way a small firm like GoHealth should not be able to compete under OBAMACARE! This $15 stock!"
"1. Valued at $6.6 billion at IPO in july 2020 at $21 per share2. Centerbridge valued the company at $1.5 billion in 20193. Now, just about a year later, the company is valued at $1.33 billion at $4.07 per shareI am dumbfounded and so should everyone else be."
Up trend now. Will be green EOD and 8+ next week.
T R L| M P WON!any questions?
"Again, 9 Insiders, not 1 or 2, or 5 or 8, collectively bought 831,000 shares some 3 weeks ago for almost $4 million. Enough said. Load up on today's gift."
I care more about good results than the stock price reaction. If there are good results and a bad/muted reaction I am going to buy a lot more.
Selling continues
"Avg price target is $13, dropped 54% in two days unreal. Amazon is moving into healthcare sector, they bought pillpack two years ago and whole foods. They could buyout Gohealth and move into healthcare big time.$20+ yeah boy."
GoHealth is down 5.02% to 8.61
"@Chris...Why dropping? Manipulation and Shorting, that's all. Take advantage of these nice dips, if you can. Frankly, anything in the $4s is good for me. Have confidence knowing that Insiders added a nice count to these positions. It wasn't just 1 buyer, and it wasn't just a few thousand shares."
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
I will wait until it's settled before I average down.
@sital....go ahead and short. Reduce your gain.
I now average 5.4. Bought this morning at 4.3.
any chance 5 next a few months?
GOCO recovered very nicely today forming a solid base!
Still worth holding?
Good position to start??
"Added 3k shares this morning below $10.20, a bargain........."
https://discord.gg/JyR7q3c
@S Z...wrong. There's catalyst when a stock has been grossly oversold. You are seeing it this morning.
"Things are going great according to the founder. Can you say reality disconnect: Clint Jones, co-founder and CEO said, ""GoHealth's second quarter revenue growth of 55% was driven by an 84% gain in our Medicare—Internal segment with LTVs expanding 5%. Our ramped up investments in our Encompass Platform led to $17 million in revenue contribution from the platform's additional services beyond enrollment for carriers. Given the 50% top-line growth over the first six months and continued strength in the market, we have raised and tightened our revenue expectations for full year fiscal 2021."""
"1 billion yearly revenue with a PPS of $4?.I'm in..Always laugh at the ""over sold"" crowd but come on. This is crazy."
I heard about GOCO the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
HUGE buy in at the end of the day....sure to pop in the morning
Dead cat bounce back that’s all will go down in next few days
Look at the business model. This company is an innovator and disruptor in a growing industry. I think it has potential based on those factors. I am looking to buy at these lows!
@Anonymous...broke $5 earlier than I thought. I was giving it to Friday.
"$5.50, $6-$10on it's way. GOCO will earn and it can compete against the biggies Humanas ,CVS, Aetna, Anthem, United Health,and Cigna. Gohealth is a viable company and helps the needy, young individuals , medicare,older folks get affordable health insurance on the market place and should not be shorted against the biggies. Once house passes bill Gohealth will rock."
"check below link. total $253,090 shareshttps://sec.report/Document/0001808220-21-000038/"
GOCO - a 5 buck chuck!
Super awesome eod lol. Flush. Holding strong.
"Looking to open a position. Which one is better - root, slqt, clov and Goco. ? Leaning towards root"
Institutions owned 100% of this one. It will go up from here.
Could this be possibly taken private now?
Shorts taking it down. Relax they will cover before the close. A buying opportunity.
"This company may be small right now, but it will double in size within 3 to 5 years. Expect to make 33 percent on average per year with GOCO. It is a sound profitable company with big plans."
Beep beep…loading zone 
Wait Wait for it lmao $2.00
Let’s break $6!!!
There’s the bottom...accum/Dist turning north...buy it now
Hey GOCO
Back to 7 soon(may be next week)
whoa .. why the high volume price drop today? Anyone?
Close to $8 by EOD
Okay I will take 5.04 as close enough to $5. May have listing/trading/holding issues under 5. Just a mess for average investors.
Will recover sooner than you think
The stock is now much closer to fairly valued. Draw a new baseline and assess the future. Lots of competition with really no competitive advantage chasing low margin business. Poor economics coupled with poor management and poor valuation equals a poor investment.
SLQT effect should be back up above 5 soon.
What do you expect when you have Obama Rahm Emmanual involved??
I have a bid set at $3
When market corrects and it hasn't lmao this $2.50-$2.00 youucchy
"Took up a small position today at $13.25. I think $4 billion market cap for a company that is going to have $870 million in the current fiscal year and growing 50% is responsible. I don't know how the HECK this was priced at IPO around $7 billion. I know there are lawsuits, but for me they are unfounded. I saw the IPO and thought it was priced too high thus avoided it. Going forward, this company is expected to have revenue at $1.1 billion for 2021 and earnings of $0.80 cents per share. That's a current P/E of 17. 2022 earnings of $1.18 puts it at a P/E of 11. The company is growing at 50%. EHLTH had the same lawsuits a month ago and the stock price dropped to $65 and now at $86.I could see this stock going lower since Walmart announced entering the medicare marketplace and the election uncertainty, but I'll continue to dollar cost average down."
@bigsky...what 'high volume'? It's only 25% of the 10-day Average.
Time to go up to $15
Stock has been taken over by Institutional algo traders. When pricing is in fractions of a penny it is not retail investors as they can't enter trades in fractions of a penny. Good luck to you.4.869 down 3.335?
Fundamentals for this is way better than any other insurance broker it’s not staying at 5$ for long scooped 100 shares today and if we do see a ugly meets ugly scenario and go to 3$ I’ll be there to scoop 200 more shares this is easy money over next few years
well I sure no how to pick them lol. I thought this would swing right back I still can not see why except for a decent sized loss that this company would lose this much value. I am down 25% now so even it it swings back probably just break even in the short term there. Not sure this is long term growth stock any more.
Buy and hold for at least 3 yrs.
17 tomorrow?
This is going to take patience
"Going to $5.50+ shorts will get burned avg PT is $12. Redditors, WSB, Robinhooders will take her up again this is a healthcare business, helping people and it is another viable business like AMC, GME. This will hit $6 then $10 when the shorts get burned."
"I'm thinking a 50% reversal to about 6, short term."
Is 19 bucks a good entry point for GOCO?
GoHealth is up 9.34% to 4.45
Between GOCO and WISH. GOCO is much better stock to purchase today.
Should be a squeeze soon due to insider buying
make it 20%+ EOD?
"This is about the cost of acquiring sales - Medicare Advantage pay a low commission, set by the Feds and the share price will go much lower because the business model is failing."
"Unbelievable, lost 50% over 2 days!! What's next???"

$22 to $11 in exactly 3 months and another all time low today - I'm all in here!
What’s wrong with this stock
Been taking a look at this company. Don’t really see anything unique about it. No dividend either. Website setup is a Medicare portal. Someone please enlighten me. Price alert that I had setup went off yesterday. No shares currently
"No go, it's sell $2.50 coming. No no no lmao."
