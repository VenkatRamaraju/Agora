"panic selling, just stepped in on a price that’s once in a lifetime"
Got in last min at $8.62
Hope it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to get some hearing back.
Just came across this stock cause the premium on Puts is crazy high. You can sell an April expiry $30/$25 Put credit spread for $2.60. That's a max 108% ROI in 1 month as long as FREQ is above $30 on April 16th.
"I have travelled with $fgen, $freq, $odt, $blue when it fell 40% in one day and takes several weeks to recover. Best bed is wait for 3/4 days before buying."

Love the trading volume today.
Is another company looking to acquire?
Good sign. Break of structure intraday. Lets see what happens. Way oversold...
Gonna be a fun ride back up!
Just waiting....
"Friend with hearing issues asked me to research FREQ. He said it is the only company actually addressing the medical issue of hearing loss rather than creating mechanical compensation. My dive showed me the following information (this is not investment advice):The TAM of hearing aide industry is ~$10B so lots of money available.Progenitor cells do not have the bad reputation of stem cells ( stem cells availability is tied to abortion clinics).USA FDA fast tracked 2a trials due to results and FREQ being only company actually addressing medical cause of hearing loss.Short interest so excessive that FREQ is a major candidate for a short squeeze.Option trading is minor thus shorts are unable to protect positions or create artificial volitility.Pharmaceutical company agreement for distribution only for USA. USA FDA hardest to convince to approve.Cash on hand and cash burn per year should reduce need to issue shares to create more cash.Company only a few years old while rest of peers are much older (and basically cancer research drug companies).FREQ also starting clinical trials on MS disease which indicates a strong belief of no negative indications from the FX-322 testing.Stock had a triple top at ~$25 creating an almost perfect ""W"" chart pattern.Stock looked to have formed a cup with handle prior to the ""W""Took a speculative position with eight percent of my portfolio when FREQ hit $25 for the third time. My belief is that you should only invest in FREQ if you can take the cash and burn it in the grill today. If you do invest in FREQ in 10 years you could burn $200 per pound KOBI beef filets on that same grill and not care that they were ruined!One of my major investment beliefs is too ""always take a 20% profit if it is made in less than three months"". Since I purchased at $25 This position should have been exited at $30. Another major investment belief is ""Stocks that double tend to double and stocks that drop by half tend to drop by half again"". Have decided to hold the position for an additional two months. Allowing the ""pig in me"" to influence my trading position due to FREQ continually setting new highs and closing at new highs. Still expecting a short squeeze in this stock!"
loaded up today let's go
Institutions Loading up causing the sudden spike near closing!!!
Should hopefully break $11 before the end of this week.
why is going down?
"For those that may have missed the Goldman Sachs presentation from June. You can find it on their investor page of their website. Management still seems extremely bullish on FX-322 even with the botched phase 2a trial. A few notable quotes from CEO David Lucchino with time stamps.1:58 - ""Frequency Therapeutics has a clear signal. We have over 200 patients as a part of all of our clinical studies and numerous data points, and when we look at this data; even with the design issues that we had around our recent phase 2a, we continue to see a clear signal and continue to show confidence in this area.""17:19 - ""We are putting those learnings to work for FX-322, which we believe can be an approved product and beyond.""21:54 - ""A lot of ENTs & audiologists have been following our work closely. Both communities understand that with a therapy like this and we believe in when we commercialize it, its going to be a real shift."""
Lol the shorts tried with all their might to drop this thing below 30
"On today's call management communicated that they saw a clear path forward: single injection. Management explained that 4 injections so closely spaced overwhelmed the environment of the middle ear... Used the analogy: ""when you re-seed a lawn, you need to stay off the grass."""
"Well call me a sucker but I bought more at $8.60 to average down, now I'm only 50% in the red. Lots of people hoping the one shot will solve all the problems, I'm not as hopeful. I just cannot sell after a huge loss like this, my inner soul is saying avg down and wait it out. GLTA"
"Wow, up 5 bucks. What's up?"
Can we get at $14!
Blessings on Easter
"Needham presentation this morning was pretty solid. No real surprises. They admit they are using these clinical studies to really dial in their target population for treatment so its unfortunate the market responds so poorly if they don't have a good outcome for a particular population. Holding 1,900 shares."
WILL FREQ NEED TO RAISE CASH VIA A SECONDARY ???/ JUST ASKING... THX BOARD..
"hey all, can someone outline some dates? when is there new trails/ report earnings etc ."
Goodbye Jeffery!
Man people over react. You swear this company was going bankrupt

this will be the future in healing. frequency
Time to buy dip
LOCK UP IS OVER...THAT IS WHY WE ARE FALLING... MAY GO INTO $11.00 AREA...JUST LIKE IPO...THEY MAY NEED MORE CASH FOR PHASE 3
"Finally seems that something good is coming! The trials are scheduled to be completed this month, therefore the presentation will be on 2nd of june. Based on the moves I expect good results from trials otherwise if no results they will be putting only a press release!"
Man. This board is quiet and boring.
Yday was the perfect opportunity for us new buyers  I’ll wait now :)
A month ago it was $60
looks like a lot of folks taking quick money this morning on the $1 uptick.
On my radar list for entry if it goes under $5 and shows insiders buying
I heard about FREQ the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I posted early this morning that FREQ would close over $9 today.BINGO!Riught again!
Reminds me of Albireo prior to releasing their PFIC topline results. Low volume and slow decrease in SP. Perceptive and Baker brothers are also large holders over there... I could see this having a similar run up after data release.
Higher than average trading volume in first 30 minutes. Noticing some are taking quick money and jumping out already. This really is a $16 stock folks; not today but in the short term.
Will bounce 25-30% back
"We will see $10 soon. But this stock is very speculative, > $100 or $0. Hopefully the company is right: a single dose works! Strong with 1,000 shares!"
"I was a candidate for this study. I was rejected because of the study's extremely astringent inclusion requirements however I really believe(d) in the science based on the company’s approach to the restoration of hearing loss. I was told I would probably qualify for phase 3. Well needless to say, I purchased about 4000 shares about a month ago…… Not only am I still deaf, now I am poor. Well it’s not my life’s savings but dang, that is still a ton of money to lose in a matter of minutes. Life lesson."
Here we go to $10..... I tend to believe FX-322 works.... Speculation but I firmly believe..... My mom suffered from hearing loss.... I'd like to see FX-322 helping many hearing sufferers ...... Again >>$100 or $0. Worth to take the risk for huge reward.
Buy and hold
"Let me guess - Jeffrey is trying to short FREQ!? Nice one buddy, I shorted it too, double bottom, now going long to ride it back up. Make money on the way down and the way back up, double wins!!! Be careful shorting and also going in too heavy in long positions too soon."
"Good information given on the weekend. Stay in this one for the long haul, folks. I know these kind of companies are risky, but FX-322 has all indications of being a) done right and b) revolutionizing the hearing health industry. Number one complaint the VA hears? Hearing loss, tinnitus, etc. It's such a huge opportunity, and I can't wait for the final Phase 2 results in early 2021."
Down 80% in a day... wow!
Here is the presentation from yesterday. You will have to log in thoughhttps://jpmorgan.metameetings.net/events/hc20/sessions/29873-frequency-therapeutics/presentation_slides
"A little bit of fun DD for everybody. Turns out that FREQ technically already has a successful stage 2 trial under their belt for their MS drug development pipeline.UCSF conducted a phase 2 trial and evaluated Clemastine (which operates on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) as a remyelinating therapy for MS. The study read out in 2017 and was successful in reducing latency delay in visual invoked potential assay which is believed to be a successful sign of remyelination. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29029896/Following the successful trial, they partnered with a biotech in Boston, can you guess which one? Frequency Therapeutics. If you look at FREQ's 2020 annual report, the 2018 license agreement with the California Institute for Biomedical Research (a division of Scripps) is listed on page 49 (using the entire PDF's page count).https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/025fd987-1363-4a8b-ae0b-e56e6e1d77a4Here is a presentation given by Luke Lairson, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at Scripps. It does a very good job explaining their research that led to the succesful trial. I recommend watching the whole 10 minutes but it is a bit technical. The successful phase 2 trial is discussed around the 8 minute mark. The partnership with Frequency Therapeutics is mentioned around the 9 minute mark. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw_y3Qlzl3cSo, the technology that FREQ is building on already has a successful phase 2 trial using Clemastine fumarate. What FREQ is currently focusing on is improving the drug cocktail so that it can produce an even more robust response than what occurred in the trial. So sure, technically FREQ is still ""preclinical"" but they aren't starting from scratch on it and we have proof showing it has clinical efficacy already."
"It's interesting to me that both Q1 & Q2 study results this year will include data regarding tinnitus, which is strongly (if not definitely) associated with degenerative hearing loss. It will be fascinating to learn if restoring hearing also reduces tinnitus. It seems logical that it would. If so, I believe there are many who might feel so-so about treating mild hearing loss but would jump at the opportunity for relief from tinnitus. There are estimated to be 50 million people in the US alone who suffer from tinnitus. It will truly be a reason for hope to these folks and to investors if the results are good."
Last I knew FREQ had little debt yet Yahoo Finance puts their debt at 46 million. Whats the deal?
looks like Zachs hit the nail on the head with buy rating yesterday
I would love to see hearing aid companies go out of business and audiologists needing to be retrained. Let me add to that the hope that tinnitus therapies also kick the bucket.
"titan, your post is FALSE. There have been ZERO DOWNgrades for FREQ in the past week.'2 of the 3 analysts have lowered their 52-week price targets, BUT NONE of the 3 FREQ analysts has downgraded FREQ.. In fact, all 3 FREQ analysts have REiterated their Ratings."
Hello Mr. $9 how you doing???
"I don't care that much about the stock, but really hope their FX322 drug restores hearing. The results they published were kind of odd. They tested the participants' ability to hear words at conversational speaking levels instead of the standard tone test that an audiologist normally gives. Not sure why they didn't use the standard test. The improvement was only around 1 decibel improvement which is not much different. It could still be a major game changer if they can give you a bunch of treatments over the course of a weeks/months and each one improves it by 1dB but it's unclear if that's the case or not. I really hope they figure it out. I haven't heard silence for over 10 years and my hearing is steadily getting worse as I get older."
"They shorted this stock AF, especially after we touch 13 $. Whole market bleeding and we are still green at close "
"Selling probably caused by funds needing money to buy Tesla, and nervousness over COVID19 relief package along with BREXIT to boot."
We are going to the moon if phase 2a results are good
Let the games begin
"Wanted to share I had time to read thru today the 10-K Comprehensive Annual Report posted under Investors and Media and SEC Filings on their website. It includes beyond detailed information on their hearing loss trials their progress establishing a pre-clinical program on multiple sclerosis using small molecules to activate oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, or OPCs, leading to remyelination. Everyone is focusing on their bright potential concerning hearing. I did not realize the potential of the same platform with multiple sclerosis. They already have a research arrangement established with Scripps and an exclusive license with Cambridge. Does anyone else know if there is any other biotech research companies making progress reverting MS? It seems their platform could have many applications no one is yet connecting them to."
"So I am wandering into a world in which I have never been. I purchased 1000 shares of Frequency yesterday morning at $10 and also found out that one of their single dose testing sites is 30 minutes from my home. I suffer from what FX-322 is supposed to treat - SSHL along with severe tinnitus and hyperacusis. Given the apparent safety profile, I don’t think I have anything to lose except some money. So unless they reject me as a participant for some unknown reason, I will be invested in this company in two different ways. Heaven help us. This condition is devastating to those who have it. Please let it work."
Talk about timing!
$20-$30 PT - ok I’ll give it a go
"I had been taken Prolensa for my eye that was chronically prescribed. Being a NSAID, it took out my hearing, in my opinion, at the 8 week mark. I am hoping to get approved for the clinical trials to see if I can get some of my hearing back. Praying!!!!!"
Usually not a good sign when the lawyers start coming out.
"WELL..... Based on today Biz Up date , it LQQK's like we may just sit at around 1/2 of the IPO price....That may be a bargain....

Down $26 ... can you say overdone?
Good run today
"As always do your own due diligence before investing in any equity. Still trying to find out if the trades initiated from the sell side or the buy side.Disclaimer LONG FREQ!My hunch is that these trade spreads (which represent 45,000 shares) is from the sell side. The writer of the options is taking some immediate cash, and betting that the price will remain well above the $25 level. Some really nice premiums being paid if you are willing to become a FREQ stock holder at:(Strike price - the premium paid = cost of shares on 7/16/21)$22.50 - $4 = $18.50$25 - $5.10 = $19.90$30 - $8 = $22$35 - $10 = $25FREQ is currently trading at $54.09The stock has huge short position (4.09M out of 25.85M float) which would need over 17 days to clear the shorts at the normal daily trading volume of 316.22 K shares.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FREQ/options?date=1626393600&straddle=false"
"$10 and above today, sentiment is changing, the drop was over cooked. GLA."
In 6 months this will be over $10 for sure...should be in the $12-$13 range.
I wish a day comes when we don’t have to run to an ENT (For tinnitus) who proudly says there is no cure for tinnitus and you have to live with it.
Brutal run...
Pretty incredible run here on no news. Hoping Q1 2021 results are good so we can continue to move higher from that point...between now and then I'd be thrilled if we can hold in the 30's...
Hopefully come Friday we'll be to $15 at least!!!!
its alive!!
"I'm in this name under $9 even managed to snag some under $8 yesterdayIts quite volatile, but a great value play and long term hold. The single dose seems to be the right path."
Buy Buy Buy After hour back up we go tomorrow will be over 15 watch and see. Remember me.
What is going on here??
Once in a lifetime prices here. Bought some more on the dip this morning! I'm either going broke on this stock or retiring in my 30s because of it.

"Good Day Board.. A little over a year ago , I went to the ear nose & throat Dr... or ENT.... He said there is a company working on a problem that I have & it is called FREQ........ So , I am sure hoping that FREQ can help in this unmet need.....I am approx 70 of age... With our set backs etc , it could take 1 or 2 or 3 ?? years from here I guess if all goes well..... or does anyone know how long it could take ?? or is there a competitor ?? THX Board..."
"Hold the line  funds short this stock AF and we are still fine, shorting ratio about 31 % already 2 days in a row, small share float only 27 mill, before 1 month this stock worth about 50 $, this will be within 1 month @ 20 $ for sure, maybe earlier, it only need some volume for moon, be patient"
Institutions invested during the 4th quarter of 20 at an average price of 20 per share. This will go up for sure. When you see price around 18... Sell
can't anyone read or understand what happened all it means is that one injection is better than 4 and they will focus on treating people with one injection this will go back up well over 40 soon you will never get a bargain price like this again buy buy.
Lets go green 
"Blackrock took a 7%+ position in FREQ. That was a LOT of accumulation and could account for the serious rise in share price. Now we can sit back and wait for the other ""funds"" to follow one of the worlds biggest funds!"
"Look, this dip is tough, but I’m still holding through. Great things to come soon."
"FREQUENCY THERAPUETICS SEES CONSISTENT FX-322 ENTRY IN STUDY PATIENTSMay 14, 2020 by Chris Wack WSJFrequency THERAPUETICS said Thursday said top-line data from an exploratory clinical study designed to show whether drug levels of FX-322 in the cochlea can be directly measured showed measurable concentrations of FX-322 in every patient and that anatomical factors didn’t prevent the active agents of FX-322 from reaching the cochlea.The company said the levels of FX-322 were predicted to reach the therapeutically active range of the treatment...... “I couldn’t post the link but they are supposed to present the results at an upcoming medical conference."
"If there is still an option (1 dose vs 4 weeks), we are still on the game!"
"FREQ Frequency Therapeutics price target raised to $68 from $48 at OppenheimerOppenheimer analyst Jay Olson raised the firm's price target on Frequency Therapeutics to $68 from $48 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Ahead of FX-322 Phase 2a Day-90 interim read-out, the analyst points out an exploratory efficacy endpoint in the study that could potentially lead to unlocking additional potential in tinnitus. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics for tinnitus, he adds. Based on the FX-322 mechanism in the context of putative pathology of tinnitus, Olson believes there's a reasonable chance that FX-322 can benefit at least a subgroup of tinnitus sufferers."
Blessings.John 3:16. 
"Short interest in FREQ had a significant change from 4.64 Million shares shorted to4.09 Million shares shorted. What is really significant is that the time required to close all short positions in FREQ based on the (rising) daily average volume is at 17.03 days. Last month it was over 20 days. Any number over 5 days is a potential short squeeze candidate. At over 20 days it becomes a promising short squeeze candidate. The only concern I have regarding a share price threat is if the company decides to do an equity raise by issuing more shares. The only real reason for an equity raise would be due to company wanting to expand from a clinical trial company to an actual distributor of product. For FREQ to move in that direction the trail(s) results would have to indicate a TAM much greater than a single pharmaceutical company being able to address, which would counter balance the dilution potential with the income potential. The hiring of the new executive VP in charge of product development could indicate the need for an equity raise along with the indication that the current trials are producing NO NEGATIVE data that would slow the testing and/or government approval(s). With the cash on hand FREQ should have adequate resources for expansion for the next 3-9 months IMHO! Disclaimer long FREQ."
This should be fun!
"Lots to like hereFREQ JPMorgan upgrades Frequency Therapeutics ahead of 'transformational' dataJPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama upgraded Frequency Therapeutics to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $56, up from $27, ahead of the Phase 2a topline readout of lead asset FX-322 in acquired sensorineural hearing loss, which is anticipated in late Q1. The analyst believes the FX-322 data have the ""potential to be a transformational catalyst"" for Frequency shares given the ""unmet need and large market"" in sensorineural hearing loss. FX-322 only needs to work in subsets of patients with conservative penetration to become a $2B product, Rama tells investors in a research note."
"Reddit is starting to heat up with FREQ buy posts.They say it could be the next target, like GME."
God bless this company for making an effort to solve a horrible medical issued that over a billion people worldwide suffer from. God's speed to you and your wonderful effort!!!
Chief Development Officer and Chief scientific OfficerEach buy 30000 shares each!
when does fda decide?
I think its still very cheap.
News today of 90 day report out for P2A gives us an earlier catalyst date in late Q1 instead of late Q2. Also like the fact that they are starting 2 more P1 studies. Gotta start building that long term safety profile. Now we sit back and wait for 90 day results. That will be a HUGE catalyst for SP IMO.
People overreacted. Indeed news was bad but single dose works... Rethink your choice. I think 20% drop is reasonable. Not 70...
Market cap of $290m with $220m in cash. That is a pretty good position to be in. Got in around $9 and happy to hold.
this is going to be $12 SOON.
"In defense of FREQ it must be said that it is very easy to have a biased clinical trial when the results are dependent on the often subjective responses to auditory stimuli. What is needed is a way, short of physical examination showing FX induced hair growth in the cochlea, something by the way they proved in the animal studies, but of course is not possible in human subjects, is a way to image hair growth through the use of high end high definition MRI technology or actual brain imaging to auditory response to get around the inherent subjective bias of auditory stimuli confirmed by verbal response."
Here we go! Love it.
"Are earnings tomorrow, and if so. What can we expect the price to go to?"
"This is wild! Share price drops 85% on a failed trial that shows that multiple treatments have no affect after a trial that showed success that 1 treatment showed positive affects. Less is more!! We are about 17% short the float, there is only 25mil shares in the float! This is a wild over reaction and is prime to bounce like a ball!"
Bargain at this level
"From Tinnitus Talk forum. Removed link to presentation as Yahoo may flag it but you can just navigate to Frequency's investor page on their website to find it.This is completely false and there is A LOT of untrue things being said on here. Personally, I think they did a terrible job of explaining/wording the data. Another way they could have put it is that 83% of patients with moderate SNHL that were treated with FX-322 in the single dose study saw 45%+ improvement in word scores. Here are the facts for the single dose study and here is the link to their presentation and you can confirm all of this yourself.Of the 15 patients that were treated with FX-322, 9 of them had only mild SNHL with word recognition scores typically 45+ out of 50 so these patients had little room to improve. Of the remaining 6 patients who had moderate SNHL, almost all of them had nearly 50% improvements in word recognition scores other than one and that one patient still had a 30% improvement. This can be calculated by using slide 38 of the presentation. The number 10% is used because it is the minimum requirement to be considered clinically significant and the hurdle they need to surpass to get this drug to market.Page 40 of the presentation also states:""Three patients who had durable improvements in intelligibility also had pure tone audiometry improvements of 10-15db at the highest frequency tested (8kHz).""So audiogram improvements did occur for half of the patients who had moderate SNHL that also saw a significant improvement in word scores.What we can conclude from this single dose study is that FX-322 doesn't provide much benefit to those with mild SNHL but provides a significant benefit to those with moderate SNHL. That is life changing for those people and big $$$ because no other treatment on the market exists. I am loading up on the stock because of this."
"Some more bad results from their trials, taking my 42% loss and moving on. I was a small holding but very disappointed in FREQ's last few trial results. Been holding this stock for quite some time. Good luck to the share holders."
Past $10. the next huddle is $10.84!
"Imagine actually buying this in the $40-$58, holy."
Should be a good long term buy at this price.
Love this stock!
"I would like to know if they are doing any testing of the drug for tinnitus sufferers, I know a lot of people with tinnitus are looking at this company for hope but are they doing any specific trials for tinnitus??"

"You guys should really look through the 8K Form posted yesterday. Some actually doubled word scores again. FX-322 - 111 Phase 1b: The Company also shared preliminary data from a recently completed open-label, single-dose study of FX-322 (FX322-111) designed to evaluate the impact of injection conditions on tolerability. In the multi-center, randomized study, subjects with mild tosevere SNHL (n=33) were injected in one ear with FX-322, with the untreated ear as the control. Hearing function was tested over the courseof 90 days following dosing. At day 90 following dosing, thirty-four percent (34%) of subjects achieved a ten percent (10%) or greaterabsolute improvement in WR scores in the treated ear, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreatedear (p <0.05). This included a subset of subjects that more than doubled their WR scores. These data were based on results from 32 of 33subjects that completed the 90-day clinical assessment period. The single dose had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated."
just broke an important price level! the next stop should be $15....
Why does the stock price go up when the company is being sued?
Buy at 11 and sell at 20….
Nice little run...let's see how much of it can hold between now and first look at P2 in March
All going well we are just getting warmed up!
Going up
Frequency Therapeutics is up 20.02% to 12.08
anyone here?
This is going to the moon today!
2 institutions sold freq stock
Our volume is gonna reach half the float or better today!
Told you the sell off was unwarranted.. Single dose is working just fine. FREQ below $8 was a gift..
"Overreaction. took a small position in FREQ: so far 5% down. If they find optimal dosing, FX-322 seems to be working. we will see..."
heading north soon
finally some green :D doubled down today... gotta bring my average down
"Do NOT FEAR the premarket trades today.Remember, FREQ was Down 8% in premarket yesterday,and then FREQ close UP by nearly 6% yesterday (and was UP over 8% just before close)."
GOING DOWN!!!!!!!!
Markets crashed yesterday....This didn’t...Why?....Caz we keep buying and it has great potential...So what do u understand....Buy buy buy
this is at least a $20 stock in the short term. its only a matter of time till the market gives it a fair price. Load up now or be left behind
The volume is so low !lmao
"With a successful Phase One under their belts and Phase II on Fast Track the future of FREQ is looking very, very, good. Did the research and the only possible competition is coming from Audion Therapeutics LY305648 which is in Phase II since January 2019. There is room for two successful treatment options in this market. FREQ is a likely take over target by big Pharma looking to buy growth and replace block buster drugs going off patient soon. This is a multiple billion dollar market that will steal market share from the Hearing Aid Companies."
The correction should come soon...
Is this a good company to invest in ?
It is back guys .
The thing that doesn't make sense is that the drug works just not as good as they hoped it would so why did it drop to these levels. I think it's all just panic and the stock will recover soon
Freq nice shot for next week but SESN waiting for fda approval bladder cancer better to the moon
The expected publication in peer reviewed magazine. Good news ! Now we wait 4-8 more weeks for the FX-322 2a trail preliminary results. How long till the ER 4-6 weeks?
I'm wondering if it would have been a better move to announce the bad news first and then the better news from the single injection study a few days later. I'm sure the desired effect of releasing both together was to prevent a big drop in share price which obviously didn't happen.
"Usually after a drop like this, in the next few days comes a recovery. I don't know how big and how long will be . But a recovery will be."
"The price drop after the botched phase 2a is an extreme overreaction by the market in my opinion. Two single dose trials show it works and in regards to the phase 2 trial, ALL groups saw an improvement in word recognition scores but the problem is that the improvement wasn't as great as the single dose trials as well as the placebo group also improved which made it appear as if the drug recipient group didn't improve when in actuality they still did. Its not hard to believe that due to the nature of drug administration locally that multiple doses could interfere with the healing process. Its like baking a cake in the oven and trying to open the oven door and add an extra egg and some flour every 5 minutes. The ear is a very delicate chemical messaging system so its reasonable that you could mess up the healing process by piling more drug or placebo in every week rather just letting the body do its thing (plus putting a hole in the tympanic membrane every week doesn't help either with improving hearing). FREQ is a leader in this field which currently has NO treatment worldwide and they have a royalty deal with Astrellas that can be big money outside of the U.S. plus they retain rights inside U.S. Easily will be $100+ stock someday and then some, I'm loading up and going long, will be the easiest money ever made.Also, check out their recent Goldman Sachs presentation from last week on their website. Management seems extremely bullish. CEO says they still see a clear signal despite the botched 2a and made comments along the lines of ""when we commercialize it."""
"Do NOT give into the PANIC selling after hours today.If you do, you will REGRET it tomorrow."
huge volume with soaring price => absolutely bullish. Funds are BUYING.... It will go like this a month....$15.
Oh my gosh... quick up to $11.50 all of a sudden.... what happened?
Buying coming in now
in couple months...you will be so sad you didnt load up at these prices :) gl all
Keep buying stocks like this one and the frequency of which you lose money will be astounding!
Way oversold once these ambulance Chasers law suits expire it will continue to rise
Frequency Therapeutics reached an all time high at 30.01
"The drop is over cooked, only way is up"
Company seems to be doing these trials by the seat of their pants. Makes me wonder if the good news from their phase 1 study was just a statistical fluke and the drug doesn't do anything.
"Double bottom around $8 , I’m expecting this to go 9+ tomorrow"
A good thing is trading volume is growing with price going up. Absolutely great! Maybe $10.6 today?
Next week $15
whats happening here? :)
what do people think the cost of the drug be?
I'm 5002 shares and 8.46 ever.am I okay?
Very transparent attempt by shorts to trash talk the stock down before the conference this week when they know they will be most likely losing their shorts!
Idiota sold. Smart guys bought. Please read at least the news till the very end.
Believe on JESUS for life eternal.
summary: single doses works
Let's get some data drop monday pre-market and wake up to 90-100! when stock unhalts!
"I've never owned a stock that dropped to zero but this one might have a chance. I read the placebo group out performed the test group, how is that possible? Welcome to the bag holder club."
"Just released; the phase 2a data in their 8k today.In summary it appears that at day 210, 46.9% of FX-322 dosed patients (30 out of 64 patients dosed) had a 10% or greater improvement in word recognition scores. The placebo group had 58.8% of patients (10 out of 17 placebo patients) see a 10% or greater improvement. This is honestly the best news we could have hoped for. Its not that the drug doesn't work, its that the placebo group saw way too many improvements due to multiple factors so they didn't have reliable data to compare the dosed patients with. I'm so stoked I loaded up on shares before this released."
Anyone else notice the bullish action on the April 35 calls... Looks like tutes are expecting positive trial results.
"After enjoying the ride on $blue, $fgen, $odt, $freq moment, added 16K in total. Soon $advm is going break the silent and fly."
Phase 2 results could literally be released any day now.

"somebody tell me where im off here. if it's successful, they could easily 2M patients/year....probably the market is much more at 5k/patient thats 1B revenue. at 25% earnings, thats 200 million. 250 million/25 million x 20 =200 bucks/share.....easy"
Single dose works. I like the stock
