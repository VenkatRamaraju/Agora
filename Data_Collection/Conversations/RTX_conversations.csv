Great safe stock. Remember trading on this stock is best long term. low volatility due to huge amount of shares. it also goes very similar to the daily DJ avg so we may still see ups and downs and country comes back online. I think we easily get to 75 in the next couple of month. Don't forget it's also a decent paying dividend stock again long term.
"If you are high on this stock, then you're high on its medium to long term performance. I don't know why you guys are stressing over the day to day. This stock has been starting the weeks off poor and finishing strong anyway. But this day to day stuff is nice, but not why you should be bullish on this."
"Raytheon Technologies, Inc.'s RTX business unit, Missiles and Defense, recently secured a modification contract involving the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) Block 2 guided-missile round pack (GMRP). The deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. It is a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) deal that will serve Egypt.Valued at $112.7 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by December 2024. Per the terms of the agreement, Raytheon will perform Navy transition involving production efforts for RAM Block 2B and exercise options."
"Started buying it 2 weeks ago, so far have 200 shares @ avg cost $59.75... willing to go up to 500 shares.Hoping this can help balance things out. This one is now in the top 4 in terms of my holdings. My other top 3 holdings are MCD, WFC, and FB."
Planning on buying and holding for the long run. Good idea?

"In case anyone else is wondering if they are trading with or without rights to the Otis and Carrier stock dividend. Long story short, if you trade they symbol UTX it includes OTIS and CARR. If you trade the symbol UTX-WI it does not. Directly from the UTC Investor Relations website: ""Beginning on or around March 18, 2020 and continuing up to and through the distribution date, there will be two markets in UTC common stock on the NYSE: a ""regular-way"" market under the symbol ""UTX,"" in which UTC shares will trade with the right to receive shares of Carrier and Otis common stock distributed pursuant to the distributions, and an ""ex-distribution"" market under the symbol ""UTX-WI,"" in which UTC shares will trade without the right to receive shares of Carrier and Otis common stock distributed pursuant to the distributions. UTC shareowners who hold shares of common stock on the record date of March 19, 2020 and decide to sell any of those shares before the distribution date should consult their stockbroker, bank or other nominee to understand whether, the shares of UTC common stock will be sold with or without entitlement to Carrier and Otis common stock distributed pursuant to the distributions."""
"Question for the board?Am I correct, after the Carrier and Otis Tax Free Spin Offs as of 3/18/ 2020, If I currently hold 100 shares of UTX, I will end up owning 100 shares of Raytheon Technologies.Thanks for your help."
"Analyst Actions: RBC Capital Adjusts Raytheon Technologies' Price Target to $70 From $68, Maintains Outperform Rating50 minutes agoPublished 50 minutes agoMT Newswires07:51 AM EST, 11/16/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Raytheon Technologies (RTX) has an average rating of outperform and price targets ranging from $63 to $89, according to analysts polled by Capital IQ."
"Based on my assumptions pertaining to market caps prior and post UTX/RTX deal RTX has a value of around $95/sh, so it's still undervalued even if I am overly bullish. All or most tech stocks have had a HUGE run and will have to grow into those new valuations to hold those elevated stock prices.To me its a no-brainer, if there is a market correction, RTX is already corrected based on what's happening to airlines etc. Even with no correction, tech doesn't have much more to go if at all and RTX has room to get at least 20-25% or more value from the $68 level. So as the economy improves within that sector, even if there is a sell-off that selling will mainly be the huge runup in tech. This company will be solid and should gradually reach that $90-$95 stock price. And you collect decent dividends while you wait. Good luck"
average joe here. keep feeding me 1-2 shares a paycheck below 65.
Nothing like a good panic to begin accumulating more shares.
Could this be a long term stock and reach $300 in 5 years?

I Bought a bunch of shares today. Solid company with good dividend and there are soooo many technical indicators on the daily chart are are lining up for what looks to be a move higher. (see below)1) just crossed above the 25d ema and the 20d sma2) 25 ema itself is curling up3) 20d sma is crossing above 50d sma4) MACD showing bullish cross over5) We made a higher high just before the ex-dividend date6) we made a higher low7) RSI showing bullish divergence on the higher low we are ralling up from. 8) we could be about to complete an upside down head and shoulders 9) XLI broke out today
What is a better price entry point for RTX?
"If you are hoping that market will go down back to March 23 level one more time then you are completely wrong. Imagine those days when stock market halted with circuit breaker 3/4 times a day for 2 weeks not only U.S but globally. Those days are over. I understand uncertainties still exist but we are not going back to revisit March 23. The way Fed responded and injected money in the economy and amounts of stimulus money provided by Treasury to small business, Unemployment, PPP, bailout money and still pending for payroll tax cut legislation to be passed in the congress is unprecedented. I think we have reached our bottom and good days are ahead of us. Unfortunately my hero Buffett missed the boat and what he gonna do with his $137 billion cash in hand. May be he should buy some RTX."

"This is a dog. Way too many expenses, including at least $650M for new plant in Carolina.Now imminent higher taxes.Connecticut manufacturing is going to be finished. (Lost over 90% from the 80's already)In summary, expenses way up, margins down until GTF's start to come back in volume for overhaul. But those engines have 50% less blade/vanes to overhaul. Should've held onto Carrier and Otis.I see this hanging between $83 and $90 for awhile."

The civil aviation market COVID crash is currently holding RTX back - it will leap ahead when the market improves. RTX fundamentals are too good for it not to do so. Be patient and enjoy the dividend while waiting for the 2021/2022 rebound.
I never post but I will say this... RTX’s geared engines are by far the best in the world. RTX’s radar and missile technology is the foundation of our defense. That is the bottom line. From an Airline Captain & Air Force Colonel
bought today and will hold for 40 years
RTX is a great company. I own 3000 shares and will keep it for a long time.

"Buffett's playbook : I see many of you today followed Buffett’s play book.That’s how Buffett has made big money in the past, from the bear market of 1974 to the financial crisis of 2008. “Be fearful when others are greedy,” he famously advised, and “be greedy only when others are fearful.” Then there’s the third way to win. If things don’t get much worse, or much better, but bounce around indefinitely, then buy back to average down. To sum it up, here's a rundown of some of Warren Buffett's best wisdom to remember during market corrections and crashes:1. Corrections are normal and unpredictable. Nobody -- not analysts, the media, or even Buffett himself -- can tell you with accuracy when one will occur.2. Don't get upset or afraid when the market drops. Instead, recognize what is really happening from a long-term perspective -- the stock market is going ""on sale.""3. Whatever you do, don't panic and sell your stocks. When you see others panicking and headlines that say the market is in a tailspin, that's the time to look for bargains.4. Always try to keep some cash on hand, so you're able to take advantage of the bargains offered by market corrections."
Bought Puts for 9/17 at $80!
"I know a lot investors are panic stricken right now with RTX. I firmly believe if you are a long term investor, you shouldn’t worry about the stock on a daily basis. However, if you are looking into new entry point to purchase additional shares, then worrying about price fluctuations may be important. However, if you are holding this stock on a short term basis then I would be worried as RTX will take a few months to start trading over $60. I am going to hold RTX for several years. I will revisit my positions on RTX after Q2 ER to decide if I want to load up more shares. For now I want to average down my cost and have been looking at an entry point of $49-$51. Businesses constantly adapt to new challenges and environment. With sudden economic challenges posed by the virus, I personally feel that RTX will adapt to the new business environment but adaptation takes some time and its not an overnight process. RTX is in the business to make money and not lose money, therefore, I do not see them making bad decisions that will impact their balance sheet or their shareholders. I concede that they have a segment of their business that is exposed to commercial airlines in terms of after market parts. I am certain that they will mitigate that risk in order to boost shareholder’s stock value but this again will take some time. Enjoy your dividends for now, with many companies withdrawing dividends like WDC and DIS."
"Great report, Strong Outlook and Backlog, Excellent Free Cash Flow...A good day for longs indeed."
Patience will pay off here gang. Just hold strong IMHO. I am anyway. GL to the true longs here !!
you guys are about to enter a bidding war you need to win for Aerojet Rocketdyne. They hold all the patents Raytheon needs for hyperspace travel. Don't let Lockheed buy it out from under you at $51 -- that would be a disaster.

Was the stock symbol RTN and share was in the hundreds?? Was there a share split?
CEO completely lost his mind
"If you want a more objective view of this stock, mute Captain K, Ronald and John. I suspect they are all the same person constantly hawking their negativity on this stock. Intrinsic fair value by next year is easily 80+ per share and that's considering a worst case scenario on COVID like the CEO thinks. If its earlier than that then it can go much higher."
I was a Raytheon stock holder now obviously a RTX holder. Seems like a good buy at $63 because my cost basis is now showing $76. Is the div safe at 4.6%? or is it going down to 3%? Div payout ratio looks ok at 45.8% Looking long for growth and income. Maybe a wait and see after the May 7th report.
I am loving the trend.
This is more than $200stock in the long run. Stay long.
"I just entered with 200 shares, what should I expect !? If you got any info or gut predictions please ... you will be welcomed :)"
Great earnings. Great backlog. Great future.
They exceeded expectations and the future looks good. Keep it going RTX. If we do not get another surge the people will travel and the planes will fly and Pratt will make $$$$$$$$$$.
One of my new favorite companies I’ve been adding to my portfolio.
Read SA report
w-o-m-e-n are almost controlling RTX and pushing it to wrong direction.
Wow! These guys are the real deal. Think I'll add this one to my long term holdings.
back on 26Jan RTX said they were boosting dividend as well as doing a stock buyback
Let's take a vote. Thumbs up if you think RTX trades on the positive side July 28 (after known earnings)
anytime 70 plus
"being dragged down solely due to airlines news. they r more involved in aerodefense systems rather then commercial.Ah well, guilty by association."
"I have 2 shares ,all I can afford, I?m sitting at #$%$00 due to the trade fee,. I am holding long term . This is a solid company"
I will keep adding at these prices. This company is STRONG and going nowhere. This is a DEAL of a price. Bought in at $50 right after the merger and kicked myself for not buying more. This is a gift and bought more today. Mergers are seldom smooth at first. This is a great long term and America will show it's strength with the military as not to look weak to the world during the pandemic.
I added today at $129.50. What a gift!
why hasn't earnings under insights been updated for 2nd quarteralso resistance and support levels used to be displayed. why havs these been removed
This is definitely undervalued but it won’t give you quick money.Have to be patient Fair Value is @ $75
China  reported big slowdown last night. Home Depot tanking.. is this a good time to load up on rtx near all times high or a better time to lock  in fabulous gains before you lose them to wall st pros ?
"I just read on WSJ that RTX has suspended share buy backs. This could explain the price drop etc., They are also expecting aviation industry to make a U Shape recovery and they will face some head winds at P&W. However they expecting a profitable year. So I feel that Q2 earnings will be important for RTX and their guidance at the point will set the tone for stock price."
"Buying UTX before merger and spin-offs gives you shares in the new company, Otis and Carrier but buying Raytheon now gives you shares in just the 1 new company. Do I understand this correctly?"
"Near $60 close. No reason For RTX drop today. GDP is historic and look forward to virus abating/vaccine/cure and RTX to double. Small, uniformed house was trying to short this but missed when BA narrowed its loss, so they then looked to GDP report. As soon as market recovers they will cover this short and run for the hills."
rtx is oversold at same level from where it bounced 7 times
"Sold 300 this morning. Plenty of good, non-racist companies I can invest in ...."
"Wow, kicked out of the Dow Jones Index today! Will the shares tank tomorrow?"
It has a nice dividend! Any thoughts about if the dividend is secure? In addition to the insider buying this would appear to be a vaccine play? Any thoughts on that? Finally any concerns by anyone that Biden will cut defense budget to have more money for any stimulus?
Raytheon is up 4.92% to 85.04
"Why was defense ever so low? With Trump as president military spending increased, not tremendously in the Air Force, more in the army, but still plenty which should've kept the stock up at at least 80. It's mainly so low because of the UTX merger but Give some time to the financial experts at Raytheon maybe one or two months and they'll flip the Merger to utilize it to their benefit. Feeling good about this undervalued stockLong 500 shares!!"
"On April 2, day of merger:- UTX was $86 ( down from $155)- Ray was $117 (down from $230)Of the UTX's 82B market cap Carrier was 14B and Otis 20BSo 59% aerospace, 17% Carrier, 24% Otis which means:Of the $86 price of UTX on April 2 $50.74 is aerospace. At $155 its $91.45 which means if the value of just the utx part of the merger comes back your looking at a 80% increase in value. With Ray at $117 on April 2 and having been $235, then your looking at about a 100% increase in value.Which means that on April 2 post merger it was about $49 so based on getting back to where we were there is a good shot at a double from $49.So my new price target post covid is $98 and that just brings it back to where it was. So based on these factual numbers, RTX is a screaming buy. You are welcome."
Best guaranteed return stock right now. It's literally impossible this stock doesn't recover.

"Ratheon....get ""woke"" go broke. Many are going to sell RTX now."
"My opinion only: I'm an old-fashioned investor who looks at things like EPS, profits, Debt, Dividend yield, etc. before buying, so bear with me. With Boeing in trouble and Commercial air travel pretty much stagnant, this stock seems like it will fall more in the short term. If the Democrats get the White House, military spending 'might' suffer in favor of social programs too, not to mention our staggering National Debt. So that could stunt RTX further, again in the short term, with my definition of short-term here being 'now to out to about 1 year'. I'm holding off a while longer since I think the overall market is still not reflecting anything close to reality. With the stimulus ending and schools going back, I want to see how the market responds, if it does anything other than to continue to climb. COVID-19 infections & deaths are still increasing which make people nervous about social situations (air/cruise/train/travel/tourism, sports/concerts/events, colleges/schools etc.). Even with a vaccine, until it proves effective with the masses, most people will be reluctant to fly or take risks unless absolutely necessary, especially people in the over-60 crowd like me with a lot of disposable income. Overall consumer spending is the key, and seeing how I have reduced my spending by over 1/3 without even trying (or wanting to), and others I know have similar stories, and they are either retired too or still employed, I have to believe that, along with the unemployment rate and the subsequent mortgage/loan defaults, it will affect the stock market....eventually.... Until I feel comfortable, my 3x a week restaurant trips and 1 night a week take out, which are down to just 1 night a week takeout, won't change. I'm also longing for casino trips that won't happen for a while too. So many people working from home now means less gas bought, less in car/tire repairs, less lunches out, cancelled gym memberships, incidental/impulse spending essentially stopped (except online), etc.. all parts of consumer spending, and things will not go back to being completely the same after we have beaten this virus too. However, long term, this is a great stock. I owned Raytheon as RTN and sold in late 2017 for a nice gain (well before it became RTX). I'm looking for it to go under $50 a share, which may not happen for months, if ever. The ex-Dividend date is in August payable in September. I will not buy it before that.If you comment on this, please leave out the political and name calling stuff. I'm an independent voter with no party allegiance. My comments are about just this 1 stock, and it's just my opinion. Thank you in advance."
"Guys, the political comments are unnecessary and distracting, just vote for whomever you want, you will not convert anyone here, I am sure there is not an undecided voter on this forum. Let's keep it about RTX, our savings depends on it. :)"

This contract involves unclassified Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Indonesia, Japan, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Korea, and Qatar.AMRAAM’s ImportanceRaytheon Technologies’ AMRAAM is a versatile combat-proven air dominance weapon and enjoys solid demand from varied countries worldwide. This is evident from the latest contract win.Notably, this missile is currently being used by 37 countries across the globe, including nations such as Norway, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Poland, Kuwait, Qatar, and other allied countries. AMRAAM has been integrated into some of the renowned fighter jets like Boeing’s BA F-15 and F/A-18 as well as Lockheed Martin’s LMT F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning.In 2020, Raytheon Technologies came out with a software update for AMRAAM. This should usher in more contract wins for this particular missile system, thereby boosting revenue growth potential for the company in the coming days."

"(Reuters) -U.S. aerospace manufacturer Raytheon Technologies Corp on Tuesday lifted the lower end of its full-year sales forecast on strong performance of its defense unit and recovery in commercial air travel.Neil Mitchill, Raytheon's newly appointed chief financial officer, said in an interview that ""increasing confidence and a commercial aero recovery that we began to see take hold at the end of the first quarter"" led to the company's view for 2021.While demand for Raytheon's aviation technologies and service for aircraft manufacturers slumped during the global health crisis, its robust defense unit that contributes more than half of overall sales continued to lift its bottom line.During the quarter the company had $1.4 billion in classified bookings for defense products which Mitchill said was ""clearly an indication that the operations tempo is increasing from where we saw it exiting 2020.""The company now expects between $63.9 billion and $65.4 billion in full-year sales, compared with its previous forecast of $63.4 billion to $65.4 billion.For the quarter, Raytheon had earnings per share of $0.90 versus Wall Street analyst's consensus estimate of $0.88.

"IF,...IF,.....IF....If the commercial aerospace business gets back to 2019 levels of free cash flow (FCF) in 2023 and the defense business performs in line with analyst expectations, then Raytheon could be generating at least $7 billion in FCF in 2023.To put these figures into context, FCF of $7 billion in 2023 would mean Raytheon currently trades at just 14 times 2023 FCF.

rtx is upward bound to 100. defense is tremendous with long term contracts and aviation is incrementally recovering. the business units of this new company are worth more than the whole.
"According to Yahoo the dividend yield on this stock is 5%. That is obscene.If RTX keeps the dividend at the current level this stock will go up. Am I reading that correctly?This new business is 50% defense now, and the government is going to increase defense spending to aid in the recovery."

"I have bought and sold this stock 6 times this year, and every time it just gets better and better. I bought back in last week 5,000 shares @58.27, so I'm hoping for a good ride up. Any suggestions as to how long to hold before profit taking."
"Airborne here......I am lightening up a bit as it crawls higher. At my age I have to be careful of a big drop in the markets. If it even gets to 138 this year, I will be ecstatic. I hope the predictions come true. Some are calling for this to go up to 170. Next year would be fine. If all I got was 6% on my 401 that would be great. I am hearing that a breakup would make money for us. And that may be in the works."
I bought today. Will buy more if it goes to $57 range
"China will give it a go...The ""U.S.""now is nothing more than a hollowed out shell both culturally and socio-economically......It taks time for these weaknesses to filter through to the military...Remember...the military exists to live off the bleeding population's taxes. They exist solely for themselves as they throw out ""Freedom isn't Free"" bromides.....Thank God I did all I could to dissuade my grandchildren from even thinking about joining the incompetent machine of death and it worked....They give the recruiters my spiel ....loads of fun"
"So most of the revenue aerospace companies get is from overhaul and repair, not contracts made with government or commercial. Yes, they may get eight, nine, ten, or 11 digit contract deals, but those engines from the contract provide work for the company for 5 to 30, maybe more, years of overhaul and repair. The engine that blew up recently was about 26 years old. Imagine how much the company made from overhaul and repair for just one engine for 26 years. Now multiple that with how many engines they have.So when people say think about the government or commercial contracts, no. It is a part of it, but not the whole picture. If it was about the contract, then why did most if not all the aerospace companies plummet last year in March. It’s because if no planes are flying, there is no need for overhaul and repair. Like right now, all the PW4000 engines are grounded, and not making money for the company. Overall, commercial makes majority of the revenue for aerospace companies, not defense. That’s why both RTX and RYCEY are down since pre-covid.This comment is not meant to be bullish or bearish. This is what I know from my understanding, I do not like misinformation, and this was just more for educational purposes, I hope it helps. Source: I work in aerospace"
Any idea what the intrinsic value of RTX is? I figure it’s undervalued with potential to hit 125 before end of year
Pshhh this is stiill a 200$ stock. defensive powerhouse now for sure! Let’s go Raytheon!
"It's as true for Raytheon as it is for any other company:Get ""woke,"" go broke."
Stick to defense
"Obviously, the split announcement is hammering the stock?? Is that because it will cost UTX millions to actually carry out the split of the 3 new companies??"
I been watching the RTX not for a while but I see there is few thing good a bout and should go up any one can advice me should I buy it or should I wait am going to get 85 share but I will need advice from you guys. Thanks
Jumping on the RTX bandwagon in October one of my best moves in the lastcouple years. RTX is in strong and lucrative position to surprise even Wall Street. $45 entry and this will be a easy triple play by the end of Q3. 2022 will be even more exciting so sit tight and add if you can…
"Really?When the market crashes, United Technology crashes.ALWAYS."
The Carrier and Otis “When issued” shares are trading. Is UTX stock reflecting this? There was supposed to be a UTX “when issued” but I don’t see that. This is a mess. I mean what do the UTX shares represent. If the record date for the Otis or Carrier shares was 3/19 that would mean the ex date would be 3/18 or 3/17. However UTX didn’t open lower (reflective) of the distributions on either day. Why? What is the actual date that UTX closes at $80 and opens the next morning at ? $60 or whatever reflecting distribution. I hold UTX and am thoroughly confused. I bought more in the big dip on 17th- do those shares get the carrier or Otis shares or not!
"As a retired Raytheon management employee, I firmly believe it will slowly rise above the share price that existed before the collapse due to COVID-19. That would be approximately 100 dollars per share, when adjusted for the merger. For RTX shareholders, the post-merger dividend was raised from the pre-merger dividend with an increase of 17.77%."
"I'm confused. I bought one share of RTX on 3/31 for $134.55.Now etrade says I own two shares and lost MORE than 100% of my investment. I called, they said that would adjust Monday. It did not. Still shows I lost more than $150 on a purchase that cost me $134.I don't understand."
If this drops back to $55 i'm dropping 15k on this. Hands down the best stock in the market.
"Raytheon’s Intelligence & Space division is in line to get some serious money. The White House's 2021 federal budget request which was released on Feb.10 allocates $15.4 billion to The U.S. Space Force (USSF) the new 6th military branch that President Donald Trump officially established on December 20, 2019. That money will be put to a variety of uses. $1.6 billion for three national-security launches, $1.8 billion will go toward Global Positioning System projects and $2.5 billion will support ""space-based overhead persistent infrared systems”. Raytheon Intelligence & Space will deliver the full enhanced ground control segment, commonly referred to as GPS Next-Generation Operational Control System, or GPS OCX, in 2021. I believe RTX is extremely undervalued when Space is by all means a giant untapped market with the emergence of Artificial Intelligent (Robotics) and nanotechnologies we entered the Golden Age of Aerospace industry. http://www.parabolicarc.com/tag/raytheon/"

"I have owned RTN and now RTX After merger. I SOLD out and repurchased after profits half a dozen times using my Profits as Base to Springboard into large Shareholds when prices rank again and again and still again because others just refuse to Buy and HOLD?

This is not a good stock it is a great stock! Be Patient! Space x contracts.. missle contracts. They are loaded.
My thought - maybe it is time to replace Greg Hayes with one of the CEOs from Carrier or Otis who have shown an incredible ability to significantly increase the share price of each of the two companies that were part of UTX until the Raytheon /UTX merger last April . Compare Carrier and Otis stock price increases to UTX since the big deal that happened last year ..... Why doesn't the Board of Directors recognize the poor leadership of Greg Hayes ?

"Psychological￼ly it’s disappointing to see your investment go down day after day especially after a good earnings report, but as a long term investor I’d rather buy this on the way down than up... keep in mind my cost basis is $69.25, so I’m happy to have the opportunity to buy at these levels! One key characteristic most successful investors have in common is patience and it took me a while to finally understand that! GL 2 all the true long RTX holders and if I’m wrong 5-10 yrs from now sue me!!! lol"
"I was panicked this morning when I realized that this stock is performing very weak despite good earnings report. I have come to realize that this is a long term investment for me. I had purchased it in the 60’s expecting to breakaway into the 70’s. My thoughts are: If you believe in this company then stand by your investment and revisit it towards next Q2 earnings. In the interim this stock will be under pressure, may trade sideways, may breakdown further. However, if your goal is to hold it for at least one year; then I tell everyone don’t stress out. The market dynamics are very interesting right now; some stocks report good quarter (due to lockdowns); these stocks rise dramatically. At the same time, some stocks that report bad quarter and remove guidance also perform very well. I feel RTX common stock holders like myself are upset and puzzled that RTX did not take off like the other stocks have post earnings. Yet, I intend to lower my cost by picking up more shares if it drops further into lower 50’s or upper 40’s. I highly doubt if it will get there, but if it does I will be happy to pick up more shares at a discounted price. In fact I wouldn’t be upset if it gets to lower 50’s. I stand behind my investment as I believe in this company which is recession proof. Major companies have withdrawn their dividend payments, yet RTX has not. A company that has strong balance sheet is the way forward."
"Got a feeling under Xiden, you can't be a defense contractor for the MIC unless you perform these CRT training sessions.

"This is once in a life time opportunity to buy value and vertical growth stocks like EPR, RTX, BEP, NEP, NÉE and so on. The amount of money government injected to US economy is the largest in history. Over 2 Trillions dollar stimulus money flooded by the Trump administration:- 1. Giving everyone $1200 one time stimulus Check and additional $500 for each depending child. All tax exempt. 2. Paid medical leave, extended unemployment benefits, meaning if you qualify for Unemployment you will receive your regular weekly Unemployment compensation plus additional $600/week stimulus money for 4 months. A single person can receive his UC for example $300/weeks x 4= $1200 plus $600 /wk x 4= $2400/ month, so total $2400 +$1200 = $3600/ month. 3. Another $500 billion just passed today in the US Senate to help small businesses on the top of last month’s $500 billion which already injected to boost small businesses. This bill would provide an additional $310 billion for PPP ( Paycheck Protection Plan) with $250 billion refilling the program and $60 billion set aside for smaller institutions like credit union.4. Aid or bailout money for devastated industries like the airlines and small businesses, as well as deferrals on tax and debt payments. 5. Also under consideration bailout money for Hotels, Entertaining and Oil industries. 6. So are the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts and gigantic purchases of bonds to keep financial markets solvent.7. Federal regulators through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all home owner’s ( depending on situation) eligible to have their mortgage payments either reduced or suspended for up to 12 months. While the economic impact of this pandemic may not be long lasting but trillions of dollars infused in US economy will have a huge impact to grow our economy which we have ever seen before. If you are thinking of investing, there’ll never be a better time than the present. Seize this moment of history. No crisis should go to waste. GLTA."

"Some investors got misunderstanding about this company's profile and business scope. Original Raytheon is a military weapon research and development company. After merging with UTC, PW's main focus is also military. Collins' business is for both military and civil aircrafts. So as you can see, more than 3/4 of new RTC is for military weapon development. This company is a military company, NOT an aviation company. Its major competitor is Lockheed Martin (LMT). LMT's share price is $378. RTX's share price is $58. RTX stock is significantly undervalued. My conservative estimate on RTX share price is $120 one year later. Buy RTX now before it soars!"
FYI the hollow fan blade that failed was rejected by Pratt Whitney inspectors as non serviceable. The Airline sent it out to a third party lab that past the fan blade as serviceable and gave the okay to fly so no wrongdoing on Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford
If the CEO of Ratheon was worried about the lawsuits. He wouldn't have bought more shares last week. He would have either stood pat or sold.
