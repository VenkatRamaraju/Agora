Morgan Stanley just updated price target 110. Jeffries says 105.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"My 401K is going up because of RTX, S&P, Russell 2000 and as it goes up I move more into cash. Loving it. My RMDs are getting larger as I get older and my Social Insecurity is being taxed more because of that."

""" We welcome the competition "". This isn't a sport, it's deadly serious."
The Raytheon CEO said the company would lose several thousand people over the vaccine mandates.
RTX is solid with a great cash flow and cutting edge technologies. Meanwhile dividend is well covered and sustainable and looks likely to rise in future years.Buy and hold for the long term.
"This might go to $150B maToo bad they had to throw this woke stuff in there, kind of throws it off a bit"
Greg Hayes is going to be on Squawk Box sometime before 8:00 am. CEOs do not go on TV unless they have something good to say about their company. RTX up in pre-market over a dollar. Could this help RTX's run to 100?

"Raytheon is demanding U.S. employees declare their status as vaccinated, unvaccinated, or decline-to-state by Friday 15 October 2021. They say failure to declare will result in termination. BTW the deadline for being fully vaccinated (2 weeks after the final dose) is 1 January 2021. Raytheon is a leader in this, many other tech firms are doing a slower rollout. Rumor has it a surprisingly large number of employees have not declared or have marked decline-to-state. I wonder if Raytheon is bluffing, or will they fire people? Maybe they want to reduce the workforce? I can't imagine that this will be good for the stock price."
I think this stock is going to do well on upcoming earnings (October 26) and project robust business for the future. I would like to see 100 by year's end and I will take some profits in my 401.

OUCH !!!!!
On to $100 soon.
