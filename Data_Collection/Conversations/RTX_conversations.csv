"RTX will create a new high due to the following reasons:1. strong recovery of the US economy that positively impacts on its commercial engines & products;2. strong orders/massive backlog from Pentagon3. In the short term DOW and Nasdaq is going to create a new high respectively: a. DOW will climb to 36,070; b. Nasdaq will be at least 15,100"
New $2B contract for nuclear-armed cruise missile signed!
CEO completely lost his mind
Still pricy
They exceeded expectations and the future looks good. Keep it going RTX. If we do not get another surge the people will travel and the planes will fly and Pratt will make $$$$$$$$$$.
good QR. Hopefully we see a 5% gain today.
"Sold 300 this morning. Plenty of good, non-racist companies I can invest in ...."
Here's what you are investing in...https://www.foxnews.com/media/chris-rufo-raytheon-race-training
"( WASHINGTON — Raytheon Technologies will get up to $2 billion to develop the U.S. Air Force’s Long Range Standoff Weapon system, a new nuclear-capable, air-launched cruise missile that will be carried by B-52 and B-21 bombers.The service on July 1 awarded Raytheon a cost-plus-fixed-fee deal for the engineering and manufacturing development stage of the LRSO program, with contract options that max out at about $2 billion.) First time looking at RTX as an investment , the long range standoff weapon system looks like a good long term goverment contract for Raytheon . Any info form the long term investors would be nice ."
strong earnings report should jumpstart the share price. aviation is recovering and defense is strong.
I am loving the trend.
Raytheon goes for WOKENESS just like Coca Cola did. https://www.dailywire.com/news/2nd-largest-u-s-defense-contractor-goes-woke-white-straight-christian-men-must-identify-your-privilege-participate-in-reparations-decolonize-your-boo?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=benshapiro
Jumping on the RTX bandwagon in October one of my best moves in the lastcouple years. RTX is in strong and lucrative position to surprise even Wall Street. $45 entry and this will be a easy triple play by the end of Q3. 2022 will be even more exciting so sit tight and add if you can…
"wow this stock is dead, even GE is showing life"
This company appears to be severely compromised.
why hasn't earnings under insights been updated for 2nd quarteralso resistance and support levels used to be displayed. why havs these been removed
"it's sad that on the 20th anniversary of 9-11 a Taliban and Al Qaeda flag will be hanging from the US embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. A very sad thing for the people there as well."
Stick to defense
B52 repowering with the pw800 any day. 9 billion dollar contract.
"It's as true for Raytheon as it is for any other company:Get ""woke,"" go broke."
"China will give it a go...The ""U.S.""now is nothing more than a hollowed out shell both culturally and socio-economically......It taks time for these weaknesses to filter through to the military...Remember...the military exists to live off the bleeding population's taxes. They exist solely for themselves as they throw out ""Freedom isn't Free"" bromides.....Thank God I did all I could to dissuade my grandchildren from even thinking about joining the incompetent machine of death and it worked....They give the recruiters my spiel ....loads of fun"
"Got a feeling under Xiden, you can't be a defense contractor for the MIC unless you perform these CRT training sessions. I like the part where Raytheon has instructed white male employee to defer to everyone else in discussions. I bet the engineering on new product development will be top notch. Morale has probably already tanked, sell this stock now while you still can....."
"This is a dog. Way too many expenses, including at least $650M for new plant in Carolina.Now imminent higher taxes.Connecticut manufacturing is going to be finished. (Lost over 90% from the 80's already)In summary, expenses way up, margins down until GTF's start to come back in volume for overhaul. But those engines have 50% less blade/vanes to overhaul. Should've held onto Carrier and Otis.I see this hanging between $83 and $90 for awhile."
My thought - maybe it is time to replace Greg Hayes with one of the CEOs from Carrier or Otis who have shown an incredible ability to significantly increase the share price of each of the two companies that were part of UTX until the Raytheon /UTX merger last April . Compare Carrier and Otis stock price increases to UTX since the big deal that happened last year ..... Why doesn't the Board of Directors recognize the poor leadership of Greg Hayes ?
A pigeon delivered a tactical air strike on my vehicle today.
The CEO needs to resign immediately
"Thank God we now have ""Wokeness"" which hopefully will serve as a dagger thrust into the loins of U.S. military effectiveness.....Anything, anything at all that hampers U.S. military effectiveness is to be desired. .... Jack Tiscione"
Im out
Time to call investors relations regarding CRT
China  reported big slowdown last night. Home Depot tanking.. is this a good time to load up on rtx near all times high or a better time to lock  in fabulous gains before you lose them to wall st pros ?
This thing should be blowing the roof clean off with all these supposed new billion dollar contracts. I guess we will have to wait and see if the quaterly reports reflect the same as the media reports.
Why has it been slowly declining in price ?
Time to cancel Raytheon.
Rtx still buying back stock. Or did they stop. Thanks
"Ratheon....get ""woke"" go broke. Many are going to sell RTX now."
Sick CEO and Board that would impose this on their company. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9763503/Raytheon-orders-workers-identify-privilege-leaked-woke-training-manu
Raytheon is up 4.92% to 85.04
This company is woke! No way would I buy it. Sad .
Bought Puts for 9/17 at $80!
