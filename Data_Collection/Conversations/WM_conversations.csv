"Look at Chart....$82.5, then $78 should be bottoms, but great buy long term here!"
"Several analyst upgrades, increasing WM's price to $120-$125....Nice!"
Added more just under $116 today. It may go lower but it’s hard to get a dip in this stock lol
thinking to buy the dip but this market is Soo inflated. I don't feel safe anywhere
Really nice to see WM gaining back some of the ground it's lost over the last 6 months or so. 
WM beat Q4 estimates on both profit and earnings. I see green ahead.
Really feel like I missed the boat on this. Next market correction this will be my first acquisition
"The PE for Waste Management is not high, unless there is a market crash this stock is never going to drop on its own. You are paying for a company with a wide moat, and a service that is a necessity. Do people realize the amount of environmental regulations and red tape needed to make new land fills? Buy this stock in an up maker and buy it even heavier in a down market! Hold it til you die!"
Adding to position on weakness. A 5+% drop would suffice. My average is at 100 but I'll gladly average up still getting a discount on a great defensive play
WTH WM?! Earnings can't come soon enough. I'd love to know the reason for this huge downward slide.
Does Waste Management still pay Dividends and if so when is next payout
great company been owning since 1995
should never sell this stock
Be aware Zacks along with Cramer rate a 50% in stock picker expertise
I am beginning to see a Jimmy Carter economy. Gas is up at least 1/3. Debt skyrocket taxes lot higher interest rates up
It's all hype. Tesla is a byword everywhere but WM just move in the shadows unnoticed while making money for its shareholders.
good quarterly numbers
"Great earnings report, beat on both top & bottom $100. is gonna be in the rearview mirror!"
"The numbers looked good, why down? Time to buy IMHO."
good earnings numbers for WM
10 point range today...wow for a blue chip stock...getting scary folks
"I thought WM only goes up, what gives? In all seriousness though, I’m not concerned. The run up was perhaps overdone, and a small correction is healthy. WM will remain a core holding in my portfolio, and I look forward to many more years of great performance."
earnings beat surprised it's down in premarket
earnings beat!!!
up because of the new purchase?
pulled out of my bitcoin stocks and put my money here. safest stock there is
Is it worth startin an investment while this is at $129 or wait for a drop?
I’m keeping my money in for years to come. I love stocks that will eventually deliver. Park it in the bank and take it out when you retired !
WM = Wealth Management...
"Nice pre-earnings bump, now let's hope we have a decent run from there on earnings (reports tomorrow before the open.) We'll see! Good luck longs!"
This is a OK stock but moving too slow for me. I guess I am more of a trader than a holder.
"Closing in on 52 week high.. would be nice to hold it til earnings, then take another nice run with solid beat."
Help me out... how does a company exceed earnings during a pandemic and their stock still goes down minutes after the opening bell?
Mr. Jim Cramer has recommended WM as a buy on Mad Money.
"If you understand the garbage biz, then the decline is easy to understand and how difficult it will be to gain even close to old numbers. First, 98% of companies have either cut back or suspended service. Second, residential volume will increase with little chance to raise residential rates. Landfill volume from third parties will also take a major hit. All your costs are pretty fixed with not much room to cut your own expenses. All your fuel is hedged, limiting reduction in costs. Frontline people deserve combat pay and will get something. The future? Has to be less. Their business model of raising prices and tacking on fees will be limited. As an boss told me,""I can't price increase a customer we do not have."" Finally just think of all the lost revenue just from restaurants. Had a great run and hope some got lucky and cashed out. Redman"
"WM, one of the best investments, just get some good sleep and wake up a little richer."
Do I am looking for a position here and it will be my 1st buy. What price is a good price to start building a position? Looks like many here have been long for quite some time and like to hear some expert opinions on when to jump in
Stock was downgraded. Love the downgrade so I can add more shares!
Cramer has this stock on bullish
"WM reports today, is a beat in store??"
"5.5% dividend increase, 1.35B share buyback. Great time to own a great company."
Fish is near solving the recyclable drag. When that thorn is pulled and their most recent purchase comes on they'll be another run.
I'm predicting a 4 for 1 stock split. How's that grab ya?!
All time high today?
it looks like earnings was good...good earnings report
how are we feeling about earnings?
I’ll never sell WM :)
Why is this stock dropping so much. Should I sell?
Shareholders of record by tomorrow get a nice $.57 per share dividend!
what are the competitors for WM?
Recession proof and pays a dividend. I'm happy.
"Im Long on WM because they have they also have the resources to be able to ""go green"" in the future -- growth/innovation is unlimited for them. If they can do research on how to reduce landfills, methane gases, trash and waste (we will run out of room eventually, we use up resources/trash at a pace of 1 and half Earth's right now) then they will be an absolute powerhouse."
I’m so glad I tripled my position in WM when my broker call and told me to sell. It was $32. then. Now I’m up 3.4 times my actual money with dividend close to 7%.
"I still think this is a prime target for Berkshire Hathaway to buy and run with. It is profitable, very little competition, and a great business that will not go away."
"Going to post this here as a question, ... I'm heavy in WM & ZM ... I have another $2500 to invest in my Roth to finish out my $6K for the year. If you had the amount above, ... What would you think ... MSFT ? KEYS ? WORK ? DOCU ?Looking for suggestions, ... have 45 WM & 49 ZM (@$96) ... Look for another, or build on these two ?Thanks in advance ..."
"When you don't know what to do with your money, park it in WM."
the next earnings target is pretty high compared to past. earnings in a few weeks folks. GLTA
"Looks at the top, is it time to move on the something better"
Rough day for WM. I've been patiently waiting for a good entry point...this is the only noticeable drop in price in a long while.Debating if I should wait a pray for an entry under 100?Any ideas or suggestions are welcome and appreciated.Good luck everyone! 
WM is not a stock you day trade. it is a solid back bone for a long term portfolio.
"I'm proud to be on board for 100, now see ya 200"
"I was in at 65 2 years ago, wish i got more back then, have cash right now might have double down on this dip."
"Month long consolidation that is leaning south. I believe in this one, but think there may be better opportunity in the short term to come in."
Buy the dips
2;1 this is a very conservatively managed company. and now thay have to cleanup from tghe hurricane.
Thank you sellers. I'll gladly pick up your shares today.
About to break through the $122 wall on its way to $125.
Excellent earnings. Market is down again but this stock will hit $125 sometime in March.
goldman upgrade...did they say what their target price is? nice upside in a down market
Long.
"New all time high in less than a week! I say it 3 months ago, WM is going to be above 90 by the end of the year. Awesome company, awesome stock !!!"
I'm proud to own a stock like this. This is safe and responsible investing that my forefathers would be proud of. Good luck to everyone in 2018!
"What’s the strategy moving into earnings next week? We already know they’ll beat, but how will the stock react pre & post report?"
Bill Gates a buyer of WM stock
How do you guys feel about WM. I think it's great for the long term investment.
I dont mind the drop - i can now buy more shares lol
dividend going to be increased next week...10%?
"""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

Holding up well
my best performer new all time high
This stock literally blows in the wind of the market conditions...nothing to do with the company itself.
I have owned WM since $51–it has been the most unloved stock by wall st analysts that I have ever owned ! They flip-flop continually trying to time entry and exit points. The new Covid bill assures municipalities across the country can now pay their bills -now and in arrears——and in the future. WM will benefit from this! And so e we I’ll their competitors who have to kiss the WM ring every time they dump in a WM landfill! Farmland and landfills are the most valuable land folks!
"I have owned WM since it was in the mid 30's. I think the overall market was overpriced and now with the virus hitting the majority of the stocks will decline. WM seems to be in a business that ""we need"" yet it's high pe may hinder any gains in the foreseeable future in this environment. I'm looking at selling half of my holdings. Then getting back in if and when it gets below 100. Others thoughts?"
"if this sheet can't get moving, im selling. I think its peaked"
3 days of being down after beating earnings will mean 3 days of being up on the next interval
This stock is not for shorties. Stay long and ignore the ups and downs. Come back in 6 month to collect profit. Safe stock in a current unsafe market.
"WM is approaching the end of certain recycling contracts made back when the market for commodities was strong. Lots of waste companies had ""bets"" in place that they could charge less for recycling services because they would make it up, and more, on the back end by the sale of commodities. Well, as most know, commodities took a nose dive in China and the rest of the world (not to mention Chinese green fence) Anyway, those lousy contracts are over and losing money by those agreements are also coming to a close. Now, if somebody wants recycling, they pay the total cost of handling, processing, etc., THEN if there is a profit on the back-end commodity sale, WM and the customer split the profit. These new agreements are going to turn the recycling part of WM's financials around. It's not a big segment of their business, but the swing from losses to profit will be significant/"
"That 5 year chart looks beautiful. Recovered 13% from it's low in March, climbing slowly but nicely. Not expecting a huge snap up like a lot of people are wanting, I see this as a slow and steady grower and a great value even at these prices. Going long!"
Buffett...I'm surprised he never purchased WM.
Does anyone know to what extent (if any?) WM is involved in electronics recycling and rare earths recovery?
new all time high
i like to know why retail investors are paying 152.75/share? Please share some positive thoughts. Thanks.
A little over six years ago my broker called to recommend I sell WM in the low 30's. I added a short time afterwards. Now those shares are up 200% and I am earning 8% yield on my actual investment in this garbage stock. More people=more trash=more cash!
just bought in for long 
wm is a solid stock
"I am a small investor (for now), but I decided to pick up shares of WM at roughly $97 as I think it's a good long-term buy. Slow and steady wins the race."
Just paid my $67 month bill. At least I’m doing well with the stock.
new high today. WM in a great business. Not affected by tariffs nor the Whitehouse.
Earnings looked great. should see a nice boost today
best way to invest in WM is going LONG for a LOOOONG time. solid stock! I love to own it!
Started new position. But remember when this stock was trading @ $120
Never seen a chart so linearly upwards for one whole decade
"$LOOP Gabelli Funds, LLC, will host the 7th Annual Waste Environmental Services Symposium on March 18, 2021. This timely conference will feature presentations by senior management of several leading companies, with an emphasis on industry dynamics, new technologies $SMED $WM $WCN $CCK $CWST $RSG $DAR $REGI $CVA $ECOL $PYR $LOOP $PHE $BHTG"
"same reason csx split when the price of the stock was getting out of reach of its investors, companies like these dont get to these levels very often and wheb they do things like splits are very appropriate"
can we just go back to yesterday
"Nice stock, but too expensive right now"
How I know WM is not a stonk: only 875 messages on this board.
2 business’ immune from a recession: WM and -
"In the future, no matter who the President of the United States will be, environmental issues are of great importance.For example, problems such as global warming were thought to be a distant story decades ago, but now they have become the most pressing and important top priority.In addition to solving the global warming problem, the issue of waste and waste disposal is urgent and important.It is important to solve the existing environmental pollution problems, but solving the causes of environmental pollution is as important as it or even more.Garbage and waste are increasing year by year, and the necessity to deal with them is increasing rapidly every year.For this, the role of companies such as waste management is very important.Solving environmental problems is important in making the planet we live in a better place to live, but it is also important for our lives and health.In the future, more money and capital must and will be invested in solving environmental problems."
WM is one of my favorite stocks in the market. Great long term to add to a portfolio on a short term dip
"I bought 1500 shares of WM way back in 2000. I figured trash would always be a place to have a little money invested. I've just sat on the investment, reinventing dividends, and letting it grow. Ended up being a great little chunk of change after 19 years. I did end up selling half of my position this morning, though, as I'm harvesting some of my huge gains across many holdings. I feel the market is wildly overvalued. Nobody goes broke taking a profit."
Back to ATH. Congrats to everyone with strong hands who held through the dip
Earnings beat! However stock is up quite a bit...how much higher can it go or will it tread water?
Buffet has billions in cash...maybe he'll consider WM?
Waste Management should benefit tremendously from the low OIL prices
" sale, load up, trash is a growing business."
bucking overall downside today in market...good sign
Just bought the dip this stock never fails long term
"I think Zacks is right on the money with this gem ""The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower."""
"Nice increase in the Dividend & the buybacks too! Thanks WM, keep it up!"
"I have been in the stock since $68. Sold today as I think overall market is overvalued (which isn't the bad thing). Its all the macro events with trade wars, FED, election etc we will have a large market pull back. I will be back in the company soon enough but at these levels I am comfortable taking profit and waiting on the sidelines."
"I bought this stock at 102$ then it dipped on a downgrade to 96 or so.....anyway I kept it until 115 to see it inch it's way to 121, now profit taking .will watch a few more days, but would love to be in again after making 20% in 2 months. we will see but 110 would be a good entry for another run to 116 or so."
What an awesome day to see these numbers again !!!

"Waste Management is the perfect purchase for Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffet. It is the leader of its industry, makes an increasing profit each year, reduces costs by using natural gas vehicles, and has great leadership. Wait just awhile while I add to my holdings."
Any news or just got too expensive? Long term holder
"I like the recent acquisition of ADSW. Makes the biggest player in the space even bigger, creates synergies to help profit margins, and keeps that moat strong and wide for one of my longest holdings!"
One of the most solid investments one can make period. WM!
"I’m watching wm from the sidelines, think this is the best for retirement, safety, and income. Your opinions please."
still hanging in there...great long term holding!
I'm predicting a 3 for 1 stock split. How's that grab ya?!
WM continues to climb...great long term investment
Great earnings report! BEAT on Both earnings & revenue (guidance in line for 2019.)
This stock will be at $200 in 2-3 years. this is one of them set and forget investments.
$120 here we come. Consolidation the next couple of days I bet we get there next week
Bought some. Solid stock that clearly isn’t going anywhere along with CVS
Just sold my wm shares today. good stock but overpriced. buy back @110
WM has been a great holding for years. Unfortunately the current dividend is just over 2%. With rising rates my guess is we tread water for the next 12 months or so. I suspect dividends will keep increasing but not enough to give this stock a big boost. 95.00 by 12/31/19 my best est going forward. Unless Mr Buffet takes an interest. A 3 for 1 split could bring in more small investors
Wonder why the market is not moving this stock with good numbers
Not a stock for traders but a good one for investors. Likely why so much instutional holders.
Simply cheaper fuel equals more profit for this one.
Should WMT buy TSCO? To wrap up the rural market?
"As a long term investor of WM, I wonder how they are going to compete with all of the new companies popping up around disruptive waste management technologies. Will they acquire them or try and compete organically? Yes, WM has a moat. But what they have done in the past won’t necessarily = success for the future. Interested in how they plan on investing/adapting to this change to remain the industry leader."
Targets increased.........................94.00 and 96.00
I own a few restaurants and use WM. Put my contract on hold without pay late March-July 1 during shutdown along with many other restaurants/bars. Not saying that’ll effect it but just something to think about during these earnings
one of the few stocks up today
this one is a keeper
gona buy some monday. Good riot laggard stock for cleanup
3 investment companies give WM a buy rating or reiterate it. Move price target to 120-125. Slow and steady wins the race. Another 52 week high!
Slow and steady wins the race over time.
WM heading to $150 this summer.
THis is absolutely a strong buy. WM represents also Bill Gates's 10% portfolio. They have a 2% dividend and a market cap of 50 billions. Price target 150$
not for anything but i woud think wm is approaching split territory
I just got 100 shares at $96.25
Hope you bought some at 109. We're about to fly
"This drop... , um, why?"
"Has WM ever split it's stock? I know a lot of people think splits are meaningless, however splits allow individuals to buy 100 share lots and/or buy/sell options etc. For consumer products like Apple, you have a vested interest when making a purchasing decision. Our county decides on what waste company we use. I was just using Apple as another reason for a split."
They need to increase dividend
I wish I bought more on the dip. Now I’m trying to figure do I buy more now or back in the 90’s
"I have owned WM stock for over 2 decades . . . Current management is excellent, focused on the right metrics and equally important they are relatively quick to read and react to the changing business landscape. That is what should be expected of management. But what surprised me most over the past two decades is a widening of the barrier to entry moat for this industry. WM is a keeper."
