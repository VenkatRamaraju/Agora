"This drop... , um, why?"
2;1 this is a very conservatively managed company. and now thay have to cleanup from tghe hurricane.
We should be above $90 by now. But I know slow and steady she goes!!
Waste Management should benefit tremendously from the low OIL prices
I have owned WM since $51–it has been the most unloved stock by wall st analysts that I have ever owned ! They flip-flop continually trying to time entry and exit points. The new Covid bill assures municipalities across the country can now pay their bills -now and in arrears——and in the future. WM will benefit from this! And so e we I’ll their competitors who have to kiss the WM ring every time they dump in a WM landfill! Farmland and landfills are the most valuable land folks!
Never seen a chart so linearly upwards for one whole decade
"I'm proud to be on board for 100, now see ya 200"
dividend going to be increased next week...10%?
WM is not a stock you day trade. it is a solid back bone for a long term portfolio.
"Closing in on 52 week high.. would be nice to hold it til earnings, then take another nice run with solid beat."
Just sold my wm shares today. good stock but overpriced. buy back @110
Stock was downgraded. Love the downgrade so I can add more shares!
Does anyone know to what extent (if any?) WM is involved in electronics recycling and rare earths recovery?
This stock literally blows in the wind of the market conditions...nothing to do with the company itself.
Great earnings report! BEAT on Both earnings & revenue (guidance in line for 2019.)
About to break through the $122 wall on its way to $125.
had this stock for year and a half and didn't go anywhere I sold out
Talk about a stock to buy and hold forever.
WM = Wealth Management...
"Anyone have an idea why WM has decided to pick up our trash in over 2 weeks?We just got another email telling us it will be another week. 21 days without trash pickup, something fishy going on here. I intend to ask my neighbors tomorrow why is it they bailed on WM months ago.Please don't suggest I pickup the phone and speak to a representative; we know where that get me. Even more frustrated."
" sale, load up, trash is a growing business."
Adding to position on weakness. A 5+% drop would suffice. My average is at 100 but I'll gladly average up still getting a discount on a great defensive play
"In the future, no matter who the President of the United States will be, environmental issues are of great importance.For example, problems such as global warming were thought to be a distant story decades ago, but now they have become the most pressing and important top priority.In addition to solving the global warming problem, the issue of waste and waste disposal is urgent and important.It is important to solve the existing environmental pollution problems, but solving the causes of environmental pollution is as important as it or even more.Garbage and waste are increasing year by year, and the necessity to deal with them is increasing rapidly every year.For this, the role of companies such as waste management is very important.Solving environmental problems is important in making the planet we live in a better place to live, but it is also important for our lives and health.In the future, more money and capital must and will be invested in solving environmental problems."
Started new position. But remember when this stock was trading @ $120
"Looks at the top, is it time to move on the something better"
Bill Gates a buyer of WM stock
wm is a solid stock
SOLD 81.81
Sold all of my WM. This thing is overpriced now.
best way to invest in WM is going LONG for a LOOOONG time. solid stock! I love to own it!
BUY the dips.
good earnings numbers for WM
"I am a small investor (for now), but I decided to pick up shares of WM at roughly $97 as I think it's a good long-term buy. Slow and steady wins the race."
WTH WM?! Earnings can't come soon enough. I'd love to know the reason for this huge downward slide.
Already PEAKED
I’m keeping my money in for years to come. I love stocks that will eventually deliver. Park it in the bank and take it out when you retired !
WM beat Q4 estimates on both profit and earnings. I see green ahead.
What an awesome day to see these numbers again !!!
"I was in at 65 2 years ago, wish i got more back then, have cash right now might have double down on this dip."
Shareholders of record by tomorrow get a nice $.57 per share dividend!
bought in today. was up. now I am upside down. hope it's short lived and I see some green soon@
Simply cheaper fuel equals more profit for this one.
THis is absolutely a strong buy. WM represents also Bill Gates's 10% portfolio. They have a 2% dividend and a market cap of 50 billions. Price target 150$
All time high today?
"When you don't know what to do with your money, park it in WM."
Mr. Jim Cramer has recommended WM as a buy on Mad Money.
"increase the dividend, nice..I think they want some new long investors"
They need to increase dividend
"Has WM ever split it's stock? I know a lot of people think splits are meaningless, however splits allow individuals to buy 100 share lots and/or buy/sell options etc. For consumer products like Apple, you have a vested interest when making a purchasing decision. Our county decides on what waste company we use. I was just using Apple as another reason for a split."
earnings beat surprised it's down in premarket
avg. 19% over the last 10 yrs.awesome dude!
This stock is not for shorties. Stay long and ignore the ups and downs. Come back in 6 month to collect profit. Safe stock in a current unsafe market.
Buffett...I'm surprised he never purchased WM.
"WM is an excellent company and will rally again, if not now in the near future."
new high next week!
I dont mind the drop - i can now buy more shares lol
"Love what they are doing, but the SP is way to high to invest in... at these levels."
Even waste management can get walloped in a recession. Buying at these levels is pretty dangerous.
It's all hype. Tesla is a byword everywhere but WM just move in the shadows unnoticed while making money for its shareholders.
Added more just under $116 today. It may go lower but it’s hard to get a dip in this stock lol
Starting to look very expensive from a valuation standpoint but like beyond meat it has all the momentum could be 130 by the end of the month.
"Nice pre-earnings bump, now let's hope we have a decent run from there on earnings (reports tomorrow before the open.) We'll see! Good luck longs!"
just bought in for long 
Buyerunder116.00
thanks for the 81.50 buy
"I know stock splits have not been the rage, but WM should do a 3 for 1. Common man could afford WM and I think we would get another nice boost in price on the news."
"I still think this is a prime target for Berkshire Hathaway to buy and run with. It is profitable, very little competition, and a great business that will not go away."
Big news for WM
"The numbers looked good, why down? Time to buy IMHO."
Buy the dips
Company will still generate positive earnings in this downdraft. Buy any big pull back
Holding up well
earnings beat!!!
good quarterly numbers
One of the most solid investments one can make period. WM!
"if this sheet can't get moving, im selling. I think its peaked"
"WM, one of the best investments, just get some good sleep and wake up a little richer."
I’ll never sell WM :)
Seems like we could be in for a very NICE Thursday!?!?
"Look at Chart....$82.5, then $78 should be bottoms, but great buy long term here!"
my best performer new all time high
I wish this stock would correct so I can buy in. I feel like i'm missing the train here but i'm going to be patient.
"Nice increase in the Dividend & the buybacks too! Thanks WM, keep it up!"
Rescission Proof?
should never sell this stock
WM has been a great holding for years. Unfortunately the current dividend is just over 2%. With rising rates my guess is we tread water for the next 12 months or so. I suspect dividends will keep increasing but not enough to give this stock a big boost. 95.00 by 12/31/19 my best est going forward. Unless Mr Buffet takes an interest. A 3 for 1 split could bring in more small investors
This is a OK stock but moving too slow for me. I guess I am more of a trader than a holder.
"Waste Management is the perfect purchase for Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffet. It is the leader of its industry, makes an increasing profit each year, reduces costs by using natural gas vehicles, and has great leadership. Wait just awhile while I add to my holdings."
WM needs to automate the waste sorting conveyor belts with AI powered robotic arms with machine learning technology to sort recyclables without human labor. The faster these robotic sorters can operate the better.
"I bought this stock at 102$ then it dipped on a downgrade to 96 or so.....anyway I kept it until 115 to see it inch it's way to 121, now profit taking .will watch a few more days, but would love to be in again after making 20% in 2 months. we will see but 110 would be a good entry for another run to 116 or so."
"Itronics Reports 2018 Year End Results; Updates Operations Expansion and Diversification ProgressRENO, Nev., April 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) a Greentech Fertilizer, Silver, and Mineral Producer, today summarized its operations and diversification progress and announced sales results for the fourth quarter and full year which ended December 31, 2018.Itronics' Total Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $302,598 compared to $419,231 in the same period in 2017. Total Revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,312,848 compared to $1,850,573 in 2017. As previously reported, fertilizer sales were down significantly due to poor weather in the first half of 2018. The outlook for fertilizer sales in 2019 is for a substantial increase, driven by a strong marketing program which was started in the fourth quarter 2018. First quarter 2019 sales were up more than 50 percent compared to the prior year’s first quarter. The outlook for silver sales is for an increase due to stabilized pilot scale circuit board refining operations, and a contribution from the newly introduced “Silver Nevada Miner” 5-ounce collector bars. A silver bullion shipment was made in January 2019, and “Silver Nevada Miner"" 5-ounce collector bar sales began in February 2019. The year 2018 was pivotal for Itronics as it continues implementing long term diversification and expansion based upon increasing GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales, expanding its “Breakthrough Technology” printed circuit board refining operations, planning staged implementation of operation for other technologies within its portfolio of “Zero Waste Technologies,” and establishing a development plan for its Auric Fulstone silver gold zinc copper exploration project in Nevada. Following is a summary of the Company’s accomplishments in 2018, in order of their importance for the Company’s diversification and expansion:In May the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement to purchase a 48-acre manufacturing site at Wabuska, Nevada that includes 60,000 square feet of buildings and a rail siding to be used as an expansion property. The Company plans to initially use this site to expand its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer manufacturing operations to be followed later by circuit board refining and other metal recovery operations.In early October the Company announced that it had expanded its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales team by hiring an experienced sales manager to lead the sales effort and launching an expanded marketing program to introduce the GOLD’n GRO fertilizers to a larger customer base.During the year the Company completed important steps in perfecting its pilot scale printed circuit board refining operations. In March the Company announced that it had taken delivery of a commercial scale e-scrap grinder for grinding shredded circuit boards (e-scrap) to feed its refining furnaces. In June the Company announced that using circuit board feed for its refining furnaces that is being ground up by the new e-scrap grinder made it possible to increase the per melt yield by more than 50 percent. The silver content per melt was also increased by 50 percent.In November the Company installed and successfully started up a centrifuge whose purpose is to significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost to perform liquid/solids separations in its hydrometallurgical processing of certain silver-bearing feed materials for the refining operations. The expected benefits are being achieved, making this an important process technology breakthrough for the Company.A confidential Fulstone Project report was updated in early January 2018. The updated report identifies five target areas and recommends a 10-hole investigative drill program consisting of two drill holes for each target area. In October the Company announced the discovery, by surface sampling, of surface 0.4 troy ounce per ton gold at one location and five percent copper at another location at the Fulstone Project. The gold was found within one of the five identified target areas. The copper was found at a location that extends a previously identified mineralized zone by 2000 feet from 5,000-foot strike length to 7,000 feet strike length.>>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/041219.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsincFollow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsinc VISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comContact:Paul Knopick888-795-6336"
"question, I've been with wm for 2.5 months, do i get the dividend? if so, do i have to register?"
Really feel like I missed the boat on this. Next market correction this will be my first acquisition
Just bought the dip this stock never fails long term
what are the competitors for WM?
Really nice to see WM gaining back some of the ground it's lost over the last 6 months or so. 
Bought some. Solid stock that clearly isn’t going anywhere along with CVS
Love the $129 target
"$WM makes more money than $NIO. How is $NIO more valuable than $WM when they make no money, keep burning cash, and can’t keep up with the demand? Hilarious!"
Another solid week for WM.Easily the most consistent stock I'm following.Have a great weekend everyone.
A little over six years ago my broker called to recommend I sell WM in the low 30's. I added a short time afterwards. Now those shares are up 200% and I am earning 8% yield on my actual investment in this garbage stock. More people=more trash=more cash!

"Look at that 5 yr chart.....steady climb, that’s what I like to see"
wm continues to soar on the upside
Hopefully all this news can create a buying opportunity for WM!!
"-8,695,000 shares of Wallbridge bought by insider on Oct 2, 2020.-Huge resource, early days, great value around $1 similar to $EGO value in early 2019 (pre-reverse EGO split).-$KL just bought 9.9% of $WM.TO enabling Wallbridge to further develop huge Fenelon, Quebec property.$GDXJ $NUGT"
"I thought WM only goes up, what gives? In all seriousness though, I’m not concerned. The run up was perhaps overdone, and a small correction is healthy. WM will remain a core holding in my portfolio, and I look forward to many more years of great performance."
Time to buy defensive stock when market is correcting :)
"I think Zacks is right on the money with this gem ""The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower."""
3 investment companies give WM a buy rating or reiterate it. Move price target to 120-125. Slow and steady wins the race. Another 52 week high!
"I bought 1500 shares of WM way back in 2000. I figured trash would always be a place to have a little money invested. I've just sat on the investment, reinventing dividends, and letting it grow. Ended up being a great little chunk of change after 19 years. I did end up selling half of my position this morning, though, as I'm harvesting some of my huge gains across many holdings. I feel the market is wildly overvalued. Nobody goes broke taking a profit."
"I like the recent acquisition of ADSW. Makes the biggest player in the space even bigger, creates synergies to help profit margins, and keeps that moat strong and wide for one of my longest holdings!"
"The PE for Waste Management is not high, unless there is a market crash this stock is never going to drop on its own. You are paying for a company with a wide moat, and a service that is a necessity. Do people realize the amount of environmental regulations and red tape needed to make new land fills? Buy this stock in an up maker and buy it even heavier in a down market! Hold it til you die!"
"If you understand the garbage biz, then the decline is easy to understand and how difficult it will be to gain even close to old numbers. First, 98% of companies have either cut back or suspended service. Second, residential volume will increase with little chance to raise residential rates. Landfill volume from third parties will also take a major hit. All your costs are pretty fixed with not much room to cut your own expenses. All your fuel is hedged, limiting reduction in costs. Frontline people deserve combat pay and will get something. The future? Has to be less. Their business model of raising prices and tacking on fees will be limited. As an boss told me,""I can't price increase a customer we do not have."" Finally just think of all the lost revenue just from restaurants. Had a great run and hope some got lucky and cashed out. Redman"
Cramer has this stock on bullish
"New all time high in less than a week! I say it 3 months ago, WM is going to be above 90 by the end of the year. Awesome company, awesome stock !!!"
Recession proof and pays a dividend. I'm happy.
Help me out... how does a company exceed earnings during a pandemic and their stock still goes down minutes after the opening bell?
"That 5 year chart looks beautiful. Recovered 13% from it's low in March, climbing slowly but nicely. Not expecting a huge snap up like a lot of people are wanting, I see this as a slow and steady grower and a great value even at these prices. Going long!"
Buffet has billions in cash...maybe he'll consider WM?
I just got 100 shares at $96.25
"I’m watching wm from the sidelines, think this is the best for retirement, safety, and income. Your opinions please."
bucking overall downside today in market...good sign
"same reason csx split when the price of the stock was getting out of reach of its investors, companies like these dont get to these levels very often and wheb they do things like splits are very appropriate"
Impressive comeback...all time new high
"new high today. recession proof, however could get hit in any major market decline. High P/E.long term holder. We should still see increases in the dividend which provides some support."
the next earnings target is pretty high compared to past. earnings in a few weeks folks. GLTA
not for anything but i woud think wm is approaching split territory
No smarter CEO than Fish. Wm is a monopoly and getting bigger.145 within 12 months and with that enjoyable dividend. How nice!
Any possibility this is some sort of pre-emptive selloff in advance of earnings? Some sort of insider knowledge that they are going to be hit harder by Chinese tariffs this time around?
gona buy some monday. Good riot laggard stock for cleanup
"As a long term investor of WM, I wonder how they are going to compete with all of the new companies popping up around disruptive waste management technologies. Will they acquire them or try and compete organically? Yes, WM has a moat. But what they have done in the past won’t necessarily = success for the future. Interested in how they plan on investing/adapting to this change to remain the industry leader."
"Several analyst upgrades, increasing WM's price to $120-$125....Nice!"
Thank you sellers. I'll gladly pick up your shares today.
"WM reports today, is a beat in store??"
Look for Divi increase soon.
This is consolidating to move higher.
Added some under $114 this morning
Anyone know why this is falling?
new high today. WM in a great business. Not affected by tariffs nor the Whitehouse.
What is going on with this stock? Down over $6 since January 1st.
best way would be to wait for a stock crash. Then you buy for a huge discounted price
"Microsoft was down 7% today, Apple nearly the same. Crazy day even for very solid businesses. But they all recover after these drops, so buying over the next couple weeks if things calm down will be a great time to load up on all these safe companies."
Closing in on 52 week high as of Friday afternoon. VERY NICE WM!
still hanging in there...great long term holding!
can we just go back to yesterday
up because of the new purchase?
"I have owned WM stock for over 2 decades . . . Current management is excellent, focused on the right metrics and equally important they are relatively quick to read and react to the changing business landscape. That is what should be expected of management. But what surprised me most over the past two decades is a widening of the barrier to entry moat for this industry. WM is a keeper."
"Great earnings report, beat on both top & bottom $100. is gonna be in the rearview mirror!"
Be aware Zacks along with Cramer rate a 50% in stock picker expertise
Nice dividend/buyback news! See ya @ $90.!
"What’s the strategy moving into earnings next week? We already know they’ll beat, but how will the stock react pre & post report?"
"Month long consolidation that is leaning south. I believe in this one, but think there may be better opportunity in the short term to come in."
chugging right along
Excellent earnings. Market is down again but this stock will hit $125 sometime in March.
"this stock is not doing much..might stay to get the dividend and sell it for wmt, ups. ual"
I’m so glad I tripled my position in WM when my broker call and told me to sell. It was $32. then. Now I’m up 3.4 times my actual money with dividend close to 7%.
Earnings looked great. should see a nice boost today
$WM Goldman Initiates with a Buywww.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/goldman-sachs-initiates-wastemanagmentwmnye-with-a-buy/
"Have been invested in WM for over 10 years , great C. great returns ...always bounces back !"
This is the 1 stock I would never sell
Back to ATH. Congrats to everyone with strong hands who held through the dip
Added at $95.77 thanks
I'm calling $84.50 for tomorrow. May test near $85 at its high. Thumbs up if you agree. Down if disagree gents.
$WM made 1.5B in profits while $TSLA only made 600M. How come a waste management company outperforms Tesla in making money and it's only $50B market cap. LOL!
"Im Long on WM because they have they also have the resources to be able to ""go green"" in the future -- growth/innovation is unlimited for them. If they can do research on how to reduce landfills, methane gases, trash and waste (we will run out of room eventually, we use up resources/trash at a pace of 1 and half Earth's right now) then they will be an absolute powerhouse."
one of the few stocks up today
"Going to post this here as a question, ... I'm heavy in WM & ZM ... I have another $2500 to invest in my Roth to finish out my $6K for the year. If you had the amount above, ... What would you think ... MSFT ? KEYS ? WORK ? DOCU ?Looking for suggestions, ... have 45 WM & 49 ZM (@$96) ... Look for another, or build on these two ?Thanks in advance ..."
Does Waste Management still pay Dividends and if so when is next payout
Should WMT buy TSCO? To wrap up the rural market?
I'm in for 50 at $98.40.
Waste management aint going anywhere. buy this stock as an investment. people will never stop throwing out garbage. Yes the stock doesn't have those crazy jumps that people want to see now a days. It is an investment. You are not gonna get rich over night. But it will slow and steadily go up.
WM continues to climb...great long term investment
Rough day for WM. I've been patiently waiting for a good entry point...this is the only noticeable drop in price in a long while.Debating if I should wait a pray for an entry under 100?Any ideas or suggestions are welcome and appreciated.Good luck everyone! 
I wish I bought more on the dip. Now I’m trying to figure do I buy more now or back in the 90’s
Do I am looking for a position here and it will be my 1st buy. What price is a good price to start building a position? Looks like many here have been long for quite some time and like to hear some expert opinions on when to jump in
was too expensive for me at 60 was too expensive at 80 thing just keeps going
Does anybody have any info on the EPS drop in 2013?
is this stock reached its peak?
I'm proud to own a stock like this. This is safe and responsible investing that my forefathers would be proud of. Good luck to everyone in 2018!
Why is this stock dropping so much. Should I sell?
WM heading to $150 this summer.
Hope you bought some at 109. We're about to fly
"5.5% dividend increase, 1.35B share buyback. Great time to own a great company."
Just paid my $67 month bill. At least I’m doing well with the stock.
I am beginning to see a Jimmy Carter economy. Gas is up at least 1/3. Debt skyrocket taxes lot higher interest rates up
"All I can say is they get what they dish out . Not worth 40.00 let alone anything higher . Been here 12 yrs and all management is about insider trading to get their pockets fat then they check out ,"
I'm predicting a 3 for 1 stock split. How's that grab ya?!
I own a few restaurants and use WM. Put my contract on hold without pay late March-July 1 during shutdown along with many other restaurants/bars. Not saying that’ll effect it but just something to think about during these earnings
"I have owned WM since it was in the mid 30's. I think the overall market was overpriced and now with the virus hitting the majority of the stocks will decline. WM seems to be in a business that ""we need"" yet it's high pe may hinder any gains in the foreseeable future in this environment. I'm looking at selling half of my holdings. Then getting back in if and when it gets below 100. Others thoughts?"
Cramer is going to pump this up on mad money after the bell today.
Slow and steady wins the race over time.
Target raised132.00
Any news or just got too expensive? Long term holder
Thinking about adding this to my IRA? What's a good price to get in at?First Exposure to the trash stocks.
$120 here we come. Consolidation the next couple of days I bet we get there next week
Fish is near solving the recyclable drag. When that thorn is pulled and their most recent purchase comes on they'll be another run.
3 days of being down after beating earnings will mean 3 days of being up on the next interval
"""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

Wonder why the market is not moving this stock with good numbers
If they can get a grip on the recycling side of things we would maybe see 90s ..
mas this stock peaked?
New 52 wk high and crickets from James! If you’re going to be an eeyore on down days... at least post a smiley emoji when a new high is reached.
My only regret why I didn’t buy more
Long.
I'm predicting a 4 for 1 stock split. How's that grab ya?!
"I'm thinking a lot of businesses are closed..is that the reason for the drop in sp,...but who knows"
"Why isn't Waste Mgt a ""Buffet stock""?"
How do you guys feel about WM. I think it's great for the long term investment.
This stock will be at $200 in 2-3 years. this is one of them set and forget investments.
"Yahoo's P/E ratio is completely wrong. It's over 30, not just over 3."
Not a stock for traders but a good one for investors. Likely why so much instutional holders.
new all time high
It's been a nice ride from 30. Started lightening up several months ago and liquidated remaining position today. On to VLO (which i have been accumulating with WM proceeds) and MLPDX (new positions - don't let fees scare you - they are waived)
"I have been in the stock since $68. Sold today as I think overall market is overvalued (which isn't the bad thing). Its all the macro events with trade wars, FED, election etc we will have a large market pull back. I will be back in the company soon enough but at these levels I am comfortable taking profit and waiting on the sidelines."
pandemics create a lot of bio-waste that needs proper disposal.
it looks like earnings was good...good earnings report
Wish i had more shares.
"Nice stock, but too expensive right now"
this one is a keeper
Who’s in competition with WM that I can compare companies. I’m looking at buying 100 shares tomorrow

"WM is approaching the end of certain recycling contracts made back when the market for commodities was strong. Lots of waste companies had ""bets"" in place that they could charge less for recycling services because they would make it up, and more, on the back end by the sale of commodities. Well, as most know, commodities took a nose dive in China and the rest of the world (not to mention Chinese green fence) Anyway, those lousy contracts are over and losing money by those agreements are also coming to a close. Now, if somebody wants recycling, they pay the total cost of handling, processing, etc., THEN if there is a profit on the back-end commodity sale, WM and the customer split the profit. These new agreements are going to turn the recycling part of WM's financials around. It's not a big segment of their business, but the swing from losses to profit will be significant/"
How I know WM is not a stonk: only 875 messages on this board.
