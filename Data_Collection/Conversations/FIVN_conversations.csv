"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
ZM going right back to 300 and up like I said a couple of weeks ago.
If it keeps bleeding at this pace it will be down to the amount that wouldve been there for the 0.55 a share for the Zoom acquisition.
This is a no brainer add down under 145.
Anyone else feel like this stock has lost it's MOJO?
I changed my mind - I'll take the Zoom stock. Anyone else want a do over?
ZM $279 x 0.5533 = $154. Shares trading pre-market at $172. The problem is that a lot of share are now held by arbitrageurs. They don't care if the transaction goes through or not. Many shareholders have sold out and also don't care. Good chance that the transaction goes through as is unless a third party steps in prior to Sept 30.
"Very unwise for $FIVN shareholders to reject the deal. It makes perfect sense for ZM stock price to go up while FIVN stock price to go down today. Although both companies have similar price-to-sales valuation ratios, but ZM is very profitable while FIVN is still losing money. Also ZM is a debt free company with $5 billion dollars of cash equivalent in hand, but FIVN is loaded with debts. So the deal would actually be quite a dilution for ZM if it were to go through. Saved ZM shareholders $15 billion dollars. I believe ZM can develop its own products a lot cheaper to compete. May take longer time, but it should be a lot cheaper for Zoom to develop similar products and the internal developed product should be better integrated with Zoom's existing products."
"I am happy, that the deal was rejected, Five9 is worth much more imo."
Hope someone tells them that Fivn and Zoom have nothing to do with each other so we don't need to see zm news feeds.
About time no merger with zoom .. now we go back to business only way is up up up .. buy at the weakness every minute .. if u remember yesterday was up almost 4 box with no news .. than lost it at the end .. that will tell me someone knew from yesterday about the news … it’s very good news finally for fivn it’s not tied with zoom stock anymore .. up we go
"94% institutional owernship, 10% short float= 104%. Pushing it lower before they let this run, great buying opportunity, acquisition news could come at any time and will be on much better terms. Entering bargain territory."

"Price is now too cheap. Expect other potential acquirers to come in. Sure thing. Even if ZM ups the price, ZM won't be the acquiror. You heard it here first."
Market didn't bite on the Cramer/ FIVN CEO pump job.
FIVN up over 5 today Sorry shorties
Not moving in lock-step with ZM any longer. Wonder if they smell a white knight offer or ZM will have to sweeten the pot for the deal to go through? Moving up notably ahead of ZM price %
up over 5 pre market. upgrade?
