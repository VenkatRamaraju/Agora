They increased guidance and beat estimates but CEO is stepping down.
Get your numbers right.Beat on earnings .27 expected .22Beat on revenue 92.3 Mill expected 85-86 MillThis company is a beating machine
So they lower expectations a few cents for rest of year in this Environment and get hammered lol. I'll be picking up some extra shares so when they blow thru those earnings be back over 100.Other companies have 10x worse predictions only drop a few bucks lol
Is there a FIVN buyout in the near future? FIVN is similar to SAAS...
Net loss increases for Q2 YoY in 2021 vs 2020. This company isn't a market leader let alone an industry leader. Good luck with your purchase Zoom.
If I have 50 stocks of FIVN then how many ZM stocks will I get and when I will get ? Please let me know.
holding nicely
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five9-announces-four-packaged-applications-130000422.htmlFIVN enhanced its platforms with more apps developed by its recent acquired company
opens at 205 ish tomorrow.
Lets start the run to $200 and plus!!!
"Wells Fargo initiated coverage on Five9 Inc (NASDAQ: FIVN) with an Overweight rating. The price target for Five9 is set at $125.00. In the first quarter, Five9 showed an EPS of $0.17, compared to $0.16 from the year-ago quarter. The stock has a 52-week-high of $108.99 and a 52-week-low of $46.22. Five9's stock last closed at $108.63 per share.TODAY"
ath coming soon! $fivn
Wish I had to funds to buy more at this price
"If $FIVN is too expensive for you, LiveVox is your best alternative with $CRSA SPAC merger today"
"This is a dog. Losses continue to accelerate. Five9 remains unprofitable with a net loss of $42.1M for the quarte. If you want to go with a winner, you will buy and hold the undisputed market leader in CCaaS - NICE."
"Wow, nice pop here. I believe in FIVN for long term but should I take some profit here?"
Why the move up?
"What was with all of the distribution yesterday? Relentlessly, with no news, the pps was driven from $65.43 down to around $62, with every half hour of trade a further step down, virtually no upticks. How is that possible?"
The 400k Green candle stick....Let's move
If FIVN wants to bounce back and forth between the 150-170 range I can do that. I’d prefer it just go up but this is fine.
Excellent quarter! Please could someone more knowledgeable than I am compare and contrast Five9 and Twilio? I have a minor stake in Five9 and a little larger stake in Twilio.
Shouldn’t this be 200 to reach a market gap of 14.7 B ? Can someone explain ?
Wow strong earnings
"For full year 2020, they lowered EPS guidance from 84 cents to 74 cents, reason why it is weak in AH."
just heard a fivn commercial on CNN awesome!
"Ok - so a couple RED flags here:1. head of VP of Product shown the door2. VP's and CFO selling shares in JulyI'm shorting today. Sorry, numbers or future forecast can't be that great with these red flags."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five9-inc-fivn-evp-cloud-231516955.html
Definitely adding in the morning
So much for bad guidance. The dominance of FIVN continues.
Its seems a little expensive but they certainly have a niche in the market. The price is at $95 now. Is this a buy?
Anyone hear of rumors of FIVN landing another large Florida university?
"Here we go, stock dilution. Does anyone understand at what share price they are issuing their public offering? This information is not provided in the article."
not worried in the slightest. 5 yr chart shows a lot of swings but still up over 1000%
Five9 reached an all time high at 94.87
I have been holding this company since 40 a share and way back then i said this was a $125.00 stock. Go long and strong 
Wow Wow Wow!!! Crushed estimates and upped guidance for current quarter. $40s is within reach. This should be up 20% tomorrow.
Five9 reached an all time high at 173.30
accumulation
Five9 reached an all time high at 136.40
FIVN reached an all time high at 78.70
Five9 reached an all time high at 146.22
"My estimate open price and close tomorrow is 204-207$ a share.If the market bids up ZM shares considering this a steal or a great complement, the price could be higher.ZM has sold off a little like rest of market, so maybe it pops a bit, but usually the acquirer's stockgoes down when they announce an acquisition."
"Once it hit high of the day, they intentionally walked it down. I have a feeling that investment bankers wanted in. I think in the long run, and now that the world is a changing on how business is done, I think this will double in a year."
Slam dunk!!
green!
"This stock never comes in for long. Suggestions for initiating a new position? It just keeps chugging higher and higher. It's tough to find a good entry point. And today was yet another great example, falls to 87.77 and closes down only 1% and near it's all time high. Amazing price action!"
Best of breed baby !!!!!
Five9 reached an all time high at 143.70
Double the move from $60 = $120......
"I bought FIVN at $45 and FVRR at $45. Have done very well. They are both dominant in their fields and have long runways. For the record, I muted Zolly a year ago, but he was right."
hehehe
FIVN reached an all time high at 82.89
Five9 reached an all time high at 87.89
Only 9k shares traded ah. Profit takers
FIVN reached an all time high at 72.94
"Good first offer, but I expected the share price to be much higher than 200 by the time this deal will close, so hopefully we get some other offers. You have failed companies being bought out for 100's of percent above share price, and a super grower like FIVN is only being offered the price of what the shares were 4 months ago? Wouldn't accept anything less than 10-20% above ATH."
Stock should be up to its level if not higher than yesterday since the nasdaq and nasdaq futures are higher? looks like some stocks lost share price for no reason other than sentiment which has just been cleared up today. I call it bargain shopping though!$NOW$TWLO$DDOG$FIVN$DOCU$TEAM$CRM$WDAY$VERV
Buyout or $100 plus ..sit back and let this baby go on Auto pilot.
I have been holding for over 1 year now. Its a nice feeling. Yea go baby go.
Fantastic opportunity this morning! Purchase a company that’s firing on all cylinders at a nice discount.
trendline is clear as crystal
"You have one overvalued stock, buying another overvalued stock. Hmmmmmm"
29 times price to sales. This market is high on crack.
FIVN reached an all time high at 81.68
guess the vaccine will make people start using phone lines again
this stock rocks
"So happy this amazing, dynamic true cloud play AND low-float/thinly traded company :) finally got some mainstream exposure on Mad Money. Cramer got a call about it, hadn't heard the name, and liked it so much he followed up and did a deep dive on it and even brought on the CEO for an interview! Five9 is reinventing the space with huge name blue chip customers to mid and smaller cap companies. This will finally bring more eyeballs to the name, and get our price to where we need to be 65+ imo. (Has a 65 price target, but I think should be way higher.CRAMER COMPARED IT TO WORKDAY, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT WORKDAY DEALS WITH TEXTING AS FIVE9 DEALS WITH CELL/CALL TECHNOLOGIES/CLOUD/5G ETC..*****WORKDAY HAS A MARKETCAP OF 43B COMPARED TO FIVE9 AT 3B*****The stock is a low floater with 273 institutional holders accounting for about 59.6 million shares: top 3 holders are Blackrock, Vanguard, and T Rowe Price etc.. Last quarter the amount of new instiutional positions outpaced closed at a 2:1 ratio, which is GREAT considering the gains it has posted thus far.This is very undervalued -- could be a multi bagger soon when compared to it's peers and gets more coverage, just a bit upset my hidden gem has been found as I am still accumulating."
Five9 reached an all time high at 182.87
"Absolutely Superlative Earnings, Beat massively from top to bottom, better guideline. You can not get better than this for a cloud company."
"This is a situation where 1 + 1 = 1.5, because of the bloated equity value of each stock. With markets at all time highs, it will be difficult to please wall street and investors here."
loaded
Here comes ALL TIME HIGH !!!
Five9 reached an all time high at 92.46
"Zoom, AT&T, Deloitte, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc. The large clients/partners are adding up"
Can someone explain why it jumped from 104 to 108? No recent news
"Congrats longs, nice one"
Buyout soon???
seems like enough time has passed for a competing offer to come forward. what do folks think ?
Five9 reached an all time high at 111.01
"There is no doubt that FIVN is headed to $100 BUT, ultimately $100 is ONLY a short term target. FIVN will most likely work its way to the $160 to $180 per share, at which time I fully expect a buyout offer from Microsoft or CRM or ORCL or RNG for over $200 per share. SAVE THIS POST!!!!"
Short squeeze coming tomorrow.
Deal will fall thru or ZM will have to pay more.
five9 ceo ringing the opening bell tuesday lol
Still don't understand why anyone will agree to sell this company with such low premium and hign valuation of zoom.
Corona virus is resulting in more service via virtual contact such as Dr.'s who are available online now for virtual visits. Wouldn't this use the same software that FIVN offers? The Dr. is just someone in a call center environment now. Bullish for FIVN imo. Thoughts?
FIVN is up 7.01% to 81.63
All Stock usually means the acquirer has overvalued stock or they would pay cash . The premium will quickly disappear as Zoom declines. Expect a lower open not a higher one
What’s your FIVN target price by May 2022?
Good luck to all longs.
"Nice reversal today, we need it to gain traction now."
Bought this after ceo was on mad money. some at 74-64 and 53. Very excited about there growth!will continue to buy on dips.
"Something fishy, why drop this much?"
$210 is the max. Most buyout offers stay 10% below the offer.
"Well if this keeps going, ZM may be acquiring FIVN shares for under 100, the exact reason share holders don't want this deal is playing out, bloated ZM selling off like it should, even Cathie's endless purchases of this garbage can't stop the slaughter."
Any chance we can get this to go below 160 again? I missed that gift horse this morning.
Overvalued this co has been around almost 20 yrs and they are barely profitable now .I got in way back at $12 and sold at $129 .by the time they make real earnings per share they will have to much competiton and debt.
Green
Beat and raise
K so what happens to our shares????
"Going down fast to its 50 DMA ($92), hopefully it will hold. All cloud stocks are undergoing a steep correction."
Five9 is up 5.21% to 207.26
"With this market don't buy until the ""Gap"" has been filled. They always fill the gap!! Watch and see!It is a low float stock,one bad day it it will fill."
Five9 is up 4.93% to 190.17
FIVN reached an all time high at 76.54
Now a Canadian company!! 1200 workers moved over!!
"Used the decline today to buy 3,000 at $54.50 and ready to buy another 3,000 tomorrow and the next day. Ihope to average under $55 when I have 10,000. Will hold for 5 to 6 years and will sell at $200 a share for $2 million."
Five9 is up 5.23% to 209.84
Earning - crushed again!!! $45 tomorrow
I guess that's why the market makers dropped it from 108 to 92 a couple weeks ago. Trying to shake out the weak-fisted so they could load up!
Deal price is $200 easy money. Loaded at $193. GL
"Wow, whoever bought at 166 before the close fabulous job"
Been in on FIVN since $8 - its a real winner
"Only a matter of time before one of these companies buys Five9. MSFT, CRM, ORCL, or RNG. Estimated target price: $175 per share."
"this stock was due for a pull back , good buy opportunity for the morning "
Ready to POP !!!Hold on to your shares for the long term.
"Please explain the price weakness? How about the market doesn't like the deal, which means it might get pulled. Russell 2k explosion and this one AND ZM are on the launchpad going nowhere. The market has spoken."
Five9 reached an all time high at 97.30
FIVN reached an all time high at 78.26
probably be better if they didn't initiate things as it sends shares lower.
down on the $650M 2025 stock issue. No dilution till 2025 though.
short interest has significantly risen in the past year
"Solid report, and guidance that is certainly attainable for 2019."
"Sweetheart deal for ZM, FIVN shareholders should demand more, 200 cash and a portion of share, not this stock deal where FIVN gets dragged down with ZM selling off. Q the law firms looking into if this is a fair deal for FIVN."
"They had a decent report. I've been holding long (and hoping) for a bounce, and here it is. However since tech and software have been weak, this was my chance to take a profit which I just did. I've held this since $100 last year. I still think the stock is overvalued, and I just don't trust this market right now."
"Only $3.7B market cap for such high growth and for a company that dominates the space? WOW, that's a steal."
215-220$ tomorrow
Market cap is very small... lots of room to grow. should be 10 billion in 2 years = $180 per share.
what does RAFLMAO Mean?
FIVN reached an all time high at 72.39
"It takes iron hands to hold growth stocks during periods like this. Nothing is guaranteed, but I suspect it is in everyone’s best interest to stay long. I sold SHOP on a dip like this in the low hundreds. I did the same with NVDA. I’m not making this mistake again."
"Retail investors always focus on short term movement, which is why they don't make money in the market. ignore the short term volatility and think about where this company will be in 3 to 5 years. Will FIVN reach and exceed $1 billion in revenue? no doubt. will they maintain same margins, most likely. Will they be acquired by one of these companies, MSFT, CRM, ORCL, or RNG? Absolutely!!!!So where will the stock price be? I think that in 3 to 5 years we can easily expect a market cap of $12 billion to $15 billion. putting the price per share in the $220 to $280. SAVE THIS POST!!!!"
"FIVN is such a great long term investment, it is hard to find anything like it. High growth, dominance in its sector, collaborative relationships with the best and largest tech companies, and yet it has a tiny market cap and tiny float. To me this is easy to see how this company still get to $8 to $10 billion market cap ($150 to $180 per share) and then be acquired by MSFT, CRM, or ORCL for $13 to $15 billion. SAVE THIS POST!!!"
I wouldn't get to overexcited this could end in tragedy.
at current ZM price of ~$358 .... shouldn't FIVN be trading around $198 ? what am i missing ? does the market think this deal won't go through ?
Looks like insider trading to the full extent
FIVN reached an all time high at 71.17
Are there any thoughts running up to earnings?
"If i have ever seen a stock that is a hold, this one is it. Crazy that people are buying at this level."
$ZM acquiring $FIVN for $14B makes LVOX a very cheap takeover target. This will at least double within a year.
"Keep buying the PEAK, sellers love it!!!"
I just watch in awe....
"Shorts, here is your chance to cover, don't let it slip away. Tomorrow will be another story..."
$FIVN Downgraded by Piper Sandler Overweight » Neutral USD 220 » USD 203 Downgraded by JPMorgan Chase Overweight » Neutral USD 213 Downgrades Jefferies Hold USD 200
Deal crumbling ?
"Reply) You do know that trees don't grow to heavens, don't you? As much as I am enjoying there current run, I doubt very much it can go on for as long as you are saying........AH, YES IT CAN... FIVN IS A BLASTER ..GO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BIG CHART....TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ""SHOP"" HAS DONE..THERE IS YOUR ANSWER!"
Lots of new unexpected business! Huge growth.
looks like 60s floor
FIVN looks like it wants to bust out...but market is holding it back..
I consult for a company that uses multiple VoIP services. We put all premium users on FIVN (it costs more) because it’s far more reliable and clear. They have the best product and a good price point. They will lead in an industry that is growing and still continue to grow
"Hey Zolly, what else are you invested in? If you're willing to share."
Insider selling. Naturally i bought right after. i think its a good long term investment just hope doesnt sink too much .
Cant wait for them to report earnings in a few weeks. That couple with a rising tide raising all ships and we may see a 52 week high above 200.
Five9 reached an all time high at 112.41
why is this stock taking such a beat down?
For those of us who watch this stock on a regular basis you would have to assume this will drop 11.00 on Monday lol  
"Wow, beats and guides higher across the board ... This will pierce through a new 52-week high soon, if not tomorrow. Definitely sailing to $60s with short covering."
"See? Just like clockwork, the mm's gave us a gift this morning!"
My Daughter just made me aware of Five9 - I just bought a couple 200 shares- looks interesting for 2020 Play- What Do y’all think of the Options....
70 soon
"Whoa! Huge buy order of 220,000 shares just sent through! Is there a buyout coming??"
$100 is INEVITABLE
Probably end green!! 
Five9 reached an all time high at 84.27
Is $Fivn going to retake the uptrend anytime soon?
I was at the verge of quitting until I was introduced to Trisha and my story changed. She's a great broker.I recommend her to every serious investor.Facebook Trisha Donald
lol and it still isn't green for the day
Green!
Five9 is down 4.91% to 185.06
Beat!!! Top and bottom line Beat!!
"Best forum I’ve ever been a part of. Want to know what stocks are being bought by big money? Watch ones like FIVE9 that gradually go up, day after day."
FIVN is up 14.04% to 39.96
Any idea how much the University of South Florida contract will bring in?
Can this hit 83 - 85 by Friday? have a long position.
"Not much volume on this sell off, would love to add in the 160's, maybe tomorrow."
Baird's conference today sounded bullish. Nervous Nellie's selling since yesterday. going back to 50s.
boom!
why?
can someone help me understand why the eps shrinks and revenues grow for 2021?
"Once the profit takers get the price dropped, it'll be a great time to buy. This stock will be a long term hold as the environment for Cloud usage is strong and getting broader. If you're not in, you're going to miss out as it's still a good value."
Lol it’s about to go green. Can’t stop FIVN!!
five9 gonna land a sweet deal like $rng
my friend works for this company. he's always busy.
Upgrades coming...
Might consolidate around $63 to $65 before the next leg up to $85 - $90
If you listened to the call you would realize the close relationship this company has with Salesforce and Microsoft. It is a matter of time before one of these big dogs tries to acquire Five9
So we are way over sale price of $200 a share! What happens know?
Good job on Mad Money tonight
$FIVN Initiated by Jefferies Buy USD 220
in at $14.50. Thinking about getting out. I don't want to give it all back.
going down down down...lol
Can someone explain to me why the stock is tanking today??
Zoom to buy FIVN
Five9 reached an all time high at 85.13
Pumpers for FiveHacks have been posting hype messages on other message board. This is a bad sign as revenue growth has slowed.
Five9 reached an all time high at 134.60
New to FIVN. My DD shows that this company has tremendous growth potential Ave will probably triple in the next 2 to 3 years
gonna bounce right off that 50 day.
"Hello Mrs Stephanie A. William in case you are seeing this fair wanna say an exceptionally enormous thank you to you man, I've been making a ton of benefits with your abilities and techniques. I'm for ever thankful I'm ready to exchange and gain from you again"
3 bucks off the lows...Bullish pattern detected. You snooze you lose shorts
Awww man i want some.
enjoy the ride
Next quarter's revenue will breakout into triple digits!
"Since when is 14.2 billion not 14.2 billion?? If the purchase price was 14.2 billion, even if it's 55 share of zoom, we'll they agreed on fivn price not what zm is trading at. Until purchasing date?? Am I not correct??"
"The funny thing is... that I had to hold this for more than 8 months to see any real gains when I first bought it back in 2015. I have to admit, even after holding it for 5+ years and trading it countless times, I still don't really know what they do."
This stock will hit 150.00 easily.
University of South Florida using FIVN??? Nice if true!!
"I see a lot of newcomers. Welcome. A group of us bought in the $40 and all along believed that over $100 was INEVITABLE.Made more money on this stock than any other stock.I also like Flir. I think we can all expect to see a thermal imaging system from Flir (NASDAQ: FLIR) at the entrance to every store, office, shop, stadium, park, theater, airport, government building and restaurant."
I see a buyout in the near future!
Not moving in lock-step with ZM any longer. Wonder if they smell a white knight offer or ZM will have to sweeten the pot for the deal to go through? Moving up notably ahead of ZM price %
why is FIVN dropping its stock price from 57.90 down to 51.55. Massive performance though guidance not to far from estimates from the analyst. Is that the reason for the nearly 5% drop from previous day's performance? Total movement from the high to the low is about $6.5What is the reason for this. Can anyone give an insight to this performance?
Five9 reached an all time high at 158.00
How did I miss this segment for over 3 years
"This is much more like RNG than LivePerson. LivePerson is one-dimensional (Text Only). FIVN is voice, text, AI, everything. FIVN is a Ferrari, LivePerson is a Corrola."
"People FIVN is not a well known or followed stock by hedge funds or. institutions the daily volume is very low,when the volume trades in the multiple millions the stock price will triple like so many other companies have done,just watch and follow over the next twelve months,should be a nice three bagger."
$64 tomorrow.
Cramer loves this play
talk about v recovery
BAM! Most action this comment section has ever seen. VoIP isn’t going anywhere. I work for a CRM company and we put all of our top customers on Five9 ... they cost more soWe don’t do it for everyone but that’s great news if you’re holding their stock.
