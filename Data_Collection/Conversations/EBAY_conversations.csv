"eBay's metrics are screwed up because of Q2 of 2021. Check the quarterly chart on the Financials tab here. Earnings exceed revenue by a long shot because eBay sold 80% of eBay Korea business to Emart for approximately $3 billion and completed the sale of the Classifieds business to Adevinta on June 24th for $13.3 billion. eBay also entered into an agreement to sell approximately 135 million shares of eBay’s Adevinta stock to Permira for over $2.4 billion, reducing their ownership of Adevinta to 33%. So when we see a low P/E we are not getting the accurate picture. Forward P/E is over 18. Once the Q2 earnings fall off the schedule for the TTM, we will see a clearer picture."
"Do not look at the stock's price. Look at the company. If you believe in the company, then stay long, and do not pay attention to the price of stock. $PINS Pinterest, is a brand name. Like $FB $SNAP $EBAY $ETSY Pinterest, is a digital market place. It is a marketing billboard.I congecture there will be a lot of interested parties to marry Pinterest. ""If"" $Pypl, supposedly showed desire to explore. There will be more explorers. There was a time of SPACs. Now, the time of Mergers & Acquisitions. Even, IF Pins drops to below $40 That would be great. Smart money will start grabbing it like hungry Vultures, in African Savanas. If you are an investor, dollar cost average pins. If you are a bag holder. Do the same. Dollar cost average. Do not buy stock, As Buffet says, buy the company.Volatility is part of the investments. With great news and Positive ER, price will jump back to 60s in a matter of Days.Best regards to ALL"
Sitting pretty at a 45% gain right now from buying earlier this year. If only it wasn’t pennies to most of you with my roughly 1000 initial investment
eBay just completed a fall update for sellers. The update has more glitches than imaginable and this is the fourth quarter. It will cost lost sales for weeks.
Ebay = the wealthmakers

I love ebay. Never shop Amazon.
some analysts have raised their price target on ebay. i don' think they realize the seller exodus that will take place next year once the cash app law takes effect
"Sellers are fed up because of all of the extra work to even make a listing, and buyers have drifted away because of the poor search results (and ebay's insistence on shoving non-related items into a search) which has taken the, shall we say, 'joy' out of it. (All that matters is the stock price, though, to the ones making the decisions.)"
"EBAY: Yes...the reasons to buy and hold.- Go-to site for recent renewed collectibles craze- Also...best site to buy hard-to-get items, in-demand Christmas gifts, and out-of-stock necessities due to supply-chain disruptions.-They took over their own payment system and now will take in what PayPal used to earn from transactions.- New Marketplace for retailers-Prioritized sellers-New recognition of advertising potential like other platforms with big reach ( AMZN, FB,etc.)...all this growth potential in a stock with very little risk. Find a tech or retail company...or almost any stock for that matter, with a PE under 5...that has such a long growth runway ahead of them.This company ( and stock) just keeps quietly and consistently powering ahead...with very little risk."
Anybody think Ebay will make an acquisition in the next several months? My opinion is that they will. Kind of getting dinosaur-ish.
"If anyone wants to buy PINS for Ad data, Guess who else they likely are looking at ? EBAY thanks Apple ."
no one wants to sell on ebay any more as fees get too expensive - no revenue no profit stock plunges
sell
Lol. People need to chill. This happens every time ebay releases earnings. It will bounce back. Book mark this post.
Never forget : https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ebay-former-ceo-sued-over-193134557.html
why the big drop after good earnings report? doesn't make sence
"I'm thinking while amazon is trying to deal with supply chain problems, ebay is paid a fee by it's client merchant dealers per sale and thus avoiding most of the ongoing, costly supply chain nighmare vortex problems...."
I quit selling on eBay over a year ago and I was a very active seller however it’s a lot of work and I am tired of giving them 10%So I quit.
Why is this stock going down when the PE ratio is so low? Thanks if you know the answer.
