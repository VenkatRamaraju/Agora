People you can say whatever you want about how eBay is over valued. The truth is the whole market is over valued. eBay is actually under valued compared to other established e- commerce stocks. It is under-valued simply because the other stocks are WAY over valued. Investors are realizing that and buying to close the gap. That’s why I see eBay stock will continue to rise so long the others are in cloud 9!
"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
Thank you Lord for the Deep Discount today at $68.50 see u at $73
Good Buy - already up 35%.. with everything going back into lockdown and delta variant - this is going to 90+ by end of year
109° here in the High Desert of Southern California today!But they say it's a dry heat. . .lol humidity is 9%
I used sell on Ebay. It's no longer an auction site. Any person can complain for any reason and then the seller gets stuck. Fees take a big chunk of your money. I just cant sell on Ebay anymore. It was good once but Amazon eating their lunch
is ebay going to be investigated along with PWCC? didn't they have some type of partnership? not good imho
first class shipping going way up in the new year.10 -15% + implementation of zonal charging. That will price me out of many product because the hina vendors will still be able to ship the same items for a cost of 20 cents complements of our USPS that carries their items for next to nothing
"All ebay stores I'm speaking with are doing record business. Ebay should track amazon. Earnings should drastically surprise to the upside. Great new guy at helm. Could be a 60-80 dollar stock soon, if not higher."
what kind of nutcases is ebay hiring or has hired? i hope the public hears more about this lawsuit. they've managed to keep it out of the spotlight thus far but its just to bizarre to keep hidden
"Revenues increased 18% year-over-year to $2.9 billion.Net income was $746 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $402 million, or $0.46 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.08"
"I have been getting this error message in my browsers console a lot over the past month when trying to login to eBay. And yes my password and login are correct and I clear my cache, cookies, history very frequently. ""blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."" Maybe if someone from tech sees this they will look into it."
EBAY may be here tomorrow yes but a shadow of its former self. Wise up.
eBay… No longer owns PayPal since its spin-off years ago.
"Lol, I don’t own eBay stock, but just came here to read the comments. I quit selling in there, it’s a nightmare of Sellers and now the wonderful state I live in sends me a 1099-k for sales over $1000. eBay was something great, now it’s a sinking ship!!!"
(http://Rightpicker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"They have been doing a Radio Shack for some time now. Radio Shack was unable to keep their unique niche business going so they decided to dive in with everyone selling cell phones, which was....everyone. Ebay's veritable war with small sellers pushes them into competing with the likes of AMZN, WMT, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC.............."
"What is outlook for this company long term? Seems like they are losing sellers? And stimulus is ending soon? Plus, many more sellers (and sellers are buyers too) are planning to leave because of the 2022 new 1099 stuff, and there fees are getting more and more (many sellers make very little or nothing)"
"a lot of these new IPOs EVs are 50 bil+, and ebay still below 50 bil?"
will be in mid 70's next week.
Free listings would have increased not decreased ebay revenue and profit. Ebay is mismanaged. If you dont give out free listings at xmas there is something wrong with your management.
"their sales going to tank 50%, sellers who used to have hundreds of items listed now have zero listed"
Ebay = Domestic Terrorism Pump and Dump
"Sara, is eBay $20 yet?"
I keep buying stuff from eBay. No problems with the site. Best deals anywhere.
Too many shorties here... its smells...
"eBay and Top Officials Named in Federal LawsuitAllegations of Systematic and Psychological Torture Aimed at SilencingJournalistsAttorney Rosemary Scapicchio, featured in the hit Netflix documentary ""Trial 4,"" representing PlaintiffsJuly 21, 2021 (Boston, MA): A federal lawsuit was filed this morning at the Moakley Courthouse in Boston, on behalf of David and Ina Steiner, Natick journalists behind the ecommerce trade publication, EcommerceBytes. The journalists accuse eBay, a multinational company with a market value of more than $47 billion, of engaging in a conspiracy to torture them both emotionally and psychologically. The suit also names eBay's former CEO, former Chief Communications Officer, and Progressive F.O.R.C.E Concepts.The suit alleges eBay engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate, threaten to kill, torture, terrorize, stalk and silence the Steiners through a barrage of around-the-clock cyberstalking, ominous death threats and deliveries, and in-person surveillance that caused the Steiners to fear for their lives.""The Plaintiffs are taking the brave step to hold all those responsible, accountable for these despicable acts."" said Rosemary Scapicchio, lawyer for the Plaintiffs.As a result of their conspiracy, two of the named Defendants have been indicted in the criminal proceeding; five of the named Defendants have pled guilty to their participation. The Defendants further obstructed investigations and concealed their actions from law enforcement to protect both themselves and their employers, which enabled the torture to continue.""This has been an unbelievably difficult ordeal for my wife and I,"" said David Steiner. ""Never did we imagine doing our jobs as journalists would lead to this. We want to protect the rights of reporters and their freedom of the press. We have endured enormous cruelty and abuse and feared for our lives. If this behavior can happen to us, it can happen to anyone.""The suit seeks damages to be awarded by a jury.The legal team consists of the Law Offices of Rosemary Scapicchio, the Law Office of Jillise McDonough, and the Law Offices of Laura Panos.Media Contact:Sean HennesseyThe Castle Group"
A low supply in auto parts ebay will be the first place to buy used parts. I just bought an outside mirror for my lexus couldn't find one anywhere and found one on ebay reasonably cheap OEM even painted the same color!
@sara get a job or some hobby. you are annoying AF on this board. do better
paypal disaster will be reflected in the next quarter report - too early yet
Tanks everytime after earnings. Wait until Monday to buy. There is way to many options to wipe out by Friday. Algo's make sure that very few short term traders make money.
"Truly surprised ebay hasn’t “paid to post” a cheerleader “zacks or bloomberg” feel good story on why ebay is a good buy. All fraud, Wenig and Iannone belong in the same prison cell."
"Dying website. It can't keep up with a changing market, it will die at the feet of its competitors amazon and Walmart. Markers change fast and eBay does not."
my business has slowed big time in the past two months as large shipping price increases have put a big dent in my business model . Etsy is even worse down 60% y/y as they are not promoting listings much
"Why does Yahoo Finance rate eBay as ""overvalued"" when the P/E is 7?"
"Ebay is no longer going to be competitive ,10% final fee 3% paypal 6-9% Sales tax ,Ebay is now collecting sales tax for over 25 states , sure the other 25 states will jump on the bandwagon in the near future . ,so between the tax and sellers fees 19-22 % . Plus they're making it difficult to avoid sales Tax if your a legitimate business reseller ,no online resale tax forms ."
"I sell on ebay since 2016, as a side business, and this year was making 60k in sales per month until august. Now it's around 12k per month. My listings simply stopped having viewers. Called ebay and everyone pretends to not know whats going on. I feel for the people who depended on ebay to make a living. In the meanwhile, I'm going to short ebay stock."
"Collapsing right now, can't even hold $67. What a perfect short sell setup this one was!"
ebay's flat .30 fee plus normal fees on all lots is a rip. most of my lots sell for $1 to $2 dollars so that eliminates any profits i might have had.
"PWCC shill bidding destroys all reputations involved. The collectible business is based on trust. Not only does Ebay lose a huge client here, but the collectible world should get rocked here as well. Sell in the short term."
"Ebay just converted my seller account to a ""managed seller"". I read about this new Paypal-less feature and was horrified. Imagine giving your private information to a website not known for its security, such as ebay. Paypal is there for a reason. Paypal provides a third party barrier and provides protection. Ebay is a dying company and obviously wants to use the float from the sales for a few days rather than sending such float to Paypal where it can be immediately and easily disbursed. Upon reading comments about the slowness in getting paid with the new ebay managed seller system and my general uneasiness about security, I deleted all of my for sale listings. True, there were only 58 listings, but this ebay change indicates a major flaw in ebay's strategic thinking and is a recipe for disaster. Sell this stock."
How's everyone's call options treating them? Lets get this! Next stop $60 by earnings!
somebody tell me just ONE TIME eBay held a 6% gain on the day. I'll wait
will be in 75 next week
"On Monday, RBC Capital Markets’ Mark Mahaney downgraded eBay (EBAY) to Sector Perform from Outperform, lowering his price target on the stock to $34 from $47. Raymond James’ Aaron Kessler, meanwhile, made a similar cut to his target. Their downgrades followed similar moves from Monness Crespi Hardt’s Jim Chartier, who cut eBay to Neutral from Buy, and Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who did the same, setting $33 price target on the stock."
"Shorting here. I was a ebay powerseller for years then left as fees were to high. Tried to jump back (selling CGC graded coins), and I just can't do it. Sold 100 ounces of 2004 Silver Eagles in rolls and buyer complained that 2-3 had patina. I explained it was normal and e-bay just fully refunded them even with good pictures and description. Left me on the hook for shipping as well It took me weeks to get the final value fees back. This is just in the coin section, but the variety and sellers are really half of what it was just a few short years ago and like a quarter of what it was when I was a power seller. They are trying to go head to head with Walmart and Amazon, but what made them special is the unique items."
Hope you guys didn't cover. This thing may hit low 60s tomorrow.
"Was about to buy $2500 computer on Ebay. Upon checkout I noticed that there is a sales tax. I canceled my transaction and purchased from the vendor directly. The vendor made money, but Ebay didn't."

"-no healthy upstream* glitches- ripping customers and sellers off left and right￼-Banning people for trying to sell stuff that they bought already off eBay.￼￼The list goes on and on, this stock and many others right now prove that the stock market has nothing to do with the actual business.

"$WISH hired Jacqueline Reses from $SQ as Executive Chair, Farhang Kassaei from $GOOG as CTO (he has 11 years $EBAY experience too) in last two months, and now people sayin $WISH can't hire a big name as CFO? BIG LOL!!!"
Better than expected earnings
Why are buyer payments not automatic while seller Buy It Now relisting for a fee is mandatory? Is this the way to grow sellers? So many competing advertising streams make selling invisible. Bloated headcount costs money and drives up fees. My long term target is in the single digits.
Does Ebay still own any PYPL? How much did they own? Like MCD with CMG sold way too early.
I sold all my shares today a lot of bad things being said about this company not feeling it anymore
Does it make sense to you that eBay is at all time highs? When was the peak of their business.. 2012? This may be a $30 stock within two years. Slow bleed.
Ebay has a SOFTWARE problem. On 28 february the sold items on their sites were listed as unsold which hampered the ability to invoice customers for items. NO ANNOUCEMENT WAS PUT OUT ON EBAY ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD. How can a company make money when the customers they are counting on to sell product can't invoice?
ebay fees pricing sellers products out of the market -wake up
"I am a 24 year eBayer who is initiating a lawsuit. My account has been locked for no reason. Been going on for months. Can't be the only one. You lose a 24-year buyer who has spent in excess of .5M, your doors are closing. If there was any rationality to this market I would take a huge short position."
I will be looking to Cover my EBAY Short tomorrow at the $62 level during the regular session. Expecting a major sell-off right at market open as traders look to get out and Short interest increases.
Do opposing computers go out for beers after trading back and forth all day? I wonder
"With the second spot in e-commerce n its only in the $50s?? Something wrong with valuation, in my opinion. How does wayfair and others have a higher price, yet Ebay has almost a billion monthly visits! I jst don't know!"
I predict this stock will be at $22.00 a share by November 1st
"It has an attractive business model and wide moat, relative to peer $amzn, Alibaba stock trades at a 33.78x trailing price-earnings ratio.

"Oh where or where have the buyers gone, oh where or where can they be? I've had no Ebay sales in the last 2 weeks. But I did have send me an offer to buy a $15 Tee shirt for $1.00!"
So many buyers waiting for the right competitor to come along as at least a partial replacement for eBay.
with all the sales tax on things people will stop using ebay and only use craigslist
I never short stocks but this management team would almost confince me. Mis-step after mis-step.
Shorted 1000 shares. Way overbought and overvalued. Economy opening up will hurt eBay growth. The company warned and people are ignoring it.
"I’ve been a seller on eBay for 2 decades and never had bad feedback , always did my best to satisfy my customers … a month ago some buyer with only 3 feedbacks comes along and dings me with a negative and eBay wouldn’t remove even though I was in the right. I told eBay “eBay sellers are also eBay buyers and buy a lot off eBay etc”… I’m no longer buying anything off eBay” They can keep satisfying their 3 feedback something for nothing loser buyers .. hopefully all the sellers do the same. Ebays going down hill imo"
My sales are down 50% since the PayPal separation. I've been selling with eBay over 23 yrs. Etsy sales outpacing eBay for 1st time. The PayPal split hurt my business.
"A sincere question. This company sells things they do not buy, produce, store or transport: how is it they do not make more money than they do? Is the organization bloated?"
short selling rally
"just want to share my experience with ebay. i had an account from 2015 or so. tried to login today and it failed so i reset my password through email. password reset worked. tried to login with new password and it failed. ok so let me contact customer service, when i click the chat, it redirect me to login page. ok, well i will login via google, it just redirect me to the sign up page. well, let me try signing up with my old email, may be my account is deleted. nope, it says account already registered. this is why no one use ebay."
"the stock price of Adevinta ASA is 16.4usd now from 12usd after the deal with ebay , investors give more value to this company after they acquire ebay's classfields, and ebay still has 44% of it .and ebay still stays at 54 ,but the value from Adevinta is over 8billion plus 2.5 cashNew CEO will bring Ebay back to the top ecommerce player , he has the capability and the cash , just give him a little time."
If the P/E ratio is correct this is going to $100 next week.In fact $200 would be a better estimate.
"a good buy , see the volume coming"
"This is one of the biggest ebay frauds:Alexander Gifford filed a federal lawsuit against eBay Inc. on Wednesday. The lawsuit states the basis for federal jurisdiction is “double taxation.”The seller is seeking relief, writing: “Return of all funds collected by eBay, Inc. on used goods through double taxation.”The seller sets out his argument in the filing’s Statement of Claim as follows:“The argument is that once you have purchased something legally at retail, which would include a sales tax, it is then yours to do with what you choose. The imposition of taxes again on the same asset at two different points of time would actually be the definition of double taxation. EBay, Inc. is collecting taxes on used assets which at the time of original point of sale a tax was collected, hence, the causation of this lawsuit.“In most cases this tax lower boundary of profit is negligible and the profit is not big enough to have a tax imposed on it. An EBay fee, a transaction fee, a sales tax, and then increased shipping costs makes the argument that something is awry and needs correction.“Attempting to make up deficits through a taxation without adequate representation starts to sound like a constitutional crisis.”Gifford v. eBay, Inc. was filed in Eastern Michigan District Court, case 2:21-mc-50359."
Short ahead of earnings. eBay warned after their last earnings and the morons took it 20.00 higher. Big 30% sell off coming.
7/29/2020 Robert W. Baird -> Buy (PRICE TARGET 65)
eBay is definitely one of the beneficiaries. Sales are up 100% plus everyone I know has had record sales . They can’t keep up with order volume .
"Where does Ebay drop to? $65? $60? $50?I'm gonna say around November it'll be rolling around in the $40's, that's my guess.Have a great day, thanks!"
EBAY makes me to afford steak: Go Ebay!
"Love this stock. Already up 35% and expect it to grow to 90.00 soon.. with inflation, eBay is a value buy - and you can buy and sell new&used goods on here."
It seems EBay needs to change its business model.
"I am a novice, so this is just an observation I will make. I have been a full-time eBay seller for 18 years. Quite a few years back one of the new CEO's raised the fees for sellers. That was pretty much the big change at the time. Then, as now, Amazon was always casting a shadow. Three months or so later, eBay announced revenue increases that seemed to match the increase in seller fees. The CEO was hailed a genius and the stock shot up. Not a very sustainable method to increase revenues. It is important to keep sellers, especially with more platforms to sell on that are now available. eBay recently went to ""managed payments."" That is a .30 per transaction fee plus higher final value fees for each transaction. No more PayPal. I feel like the same scenario is happening. It is a little more expensive for sellers, but not enough to chase us off, and more revenue for eBay. They switched us to ""managed payments"" in the beginning of August. Also, there is a waiting period for sellers to get their money now. It is not immediate like it was with PayPal. Millions of dollars are being held in ""pending"" everyday. Wouldn't that add to interest income?"
"Pam Omidyar sold $1.04 million in (EBAY) stock on the open market last week, her first such transaction in more than a decade. This year has been a wipeout for eBay stock."
"If anyone who works at Ebay reads this, please have your quality control go through and tell sellers who have products listed as made in America (that is actually shipping from China, etc) to have the sellers change country origin of manufacture. I don't want to be tricked into thinking I am actually getting American made when in fact it has been manufactured in China or other foreign country."
"This company is slowly bleeding. Sellers are fleeing to better platforms, buyers aren't on anymore. Too expensive."
"They made selling untenable for me years ago. Now buying is driving me away as well, with all these ""USA Seller""s that are actually in China. I pay more for an item thats based in the US so I get it quicker and it doesnt start tracking in the US for 2 weeks because its actually coming from China. I'm done with that stuff."
Major lawsuit filed in federal court vs eBay for cyberstalking. Google it
eBay $80 this week?
"Let me describe one of the ways that eBay makes it easy for buyers to scam sellers and steal items, and the company is doing absolutely nothing about it. I fell victim to this. It is also very simple to do:1. The buyer claims that a local pickup only item, which is too large and heavy for shipping, is not as described even when there is nothing wrong with it. 2. eBay accepts the not as described claim at face value (even if there is photo proof otherwise) and the only option for the seller is to accept the return and produce a return shipping label, otherwise the buyer gets the money back AND keeps the item.3. Since it is impossible to create a shipping label for an oversized item (e.g. outdoor patio furniture set or extra large TV etc.) eBay will refund the money AND allow the scammer to keep the item which is in perfectly good condition to begin with.I talked with customer service about 10 times when this happened. They repeat like a broken record that I have to create a return shipping label. Then I repeat back that it is too large for shipping, that's why it was local pickup only. Then they repeat back the same as before. I lose my money and the item, scammer wins. eBay knowingly facilitates the crime.SELL this stock. This company has no morals."
eBay is heading for a big move based upon the way the money is moving.
"I used to sell a lot on ebay, 1000's of items per year, but I stopped using ebay last year because their fees were just too high, plus they were deleting auctions based on violations of their policies that had nothing to do with the item I was selling. An example is a vintage emergency beacon from the 1950's, they cancelled the auction and gave a strike because they labeled the 1950's item as a ""restricted police item"". A 1950's old light lol. Anyways I have saved a fortune by leaving ebay and using other sites, and I still get the same buy price I expect too, but thankfully I don't have to pay the crazy ebay fees nor paypal fees. Old school tech companies totally out of touch and greedy, it'll be their end lol."
eBay is down 4.92% to 69.80
"Glad to see eBay is burning. They banned me because I had a month of sales that were unordinary because I found a great deal on some items online. My uncle passed away and I couldn’t ship some items for a few days. When I called them and sent all information, they banned me indefinitely but had no problem collecting the $2,000 in fees. Hope someone purchases them and cleans this site up. It’s outdated, ineffective, and customer support is non-existent. Considering they charge 10% for fees on every item sold, I have no idea why they are doing so bad."
Did they release their report yet? What happened?

"#$%$ vanguard I know u dumped it after Amazon earnings "". Don't worry fidelity will buy back"
Still tons of room to grow. Will hold for another 25% 
"BEWARE...once Ebay has your BANK routing number??? there is ""NO WAY"" to stop Ebay from taking your BANK money....THERE is no stop payment with routing number??? So??? someones says NEVRR got your item??? say $500.00 ? Ebay takes $500.00 CASH out of your bank account!!! May bounce other checks and HUGE bank FEES...Only way to stop transfers is to CLOSE that account!!! open another...THERE are NO stop payments!!!! CLOSE only way to stop EBAY!!!! and try to CALL???? Forget that....will kill you in bank $$$ FEES...you really TRUST someone who you can NEVER REACH???"
"I want this to go sky high, ""to the moon"" in 2021, because 2022 is going to be a blood bath for them and I'll be going heavy on puts. For anyone not aware, search for the new 1099 rule that will be enforced starting in 2022. Say goodbye to casual sellers. Say goodbye to resellers (those that buy items off eBay and relist them immediately). Now all you have is a lamer, more expensive version of Amazon with way worse customer service. Bye bye eBay, you deserve to fail."
"I sold it on eBay! 35,988 times!"
"""Too Little, Too Late"" - Ebay's business M.O. since inception"
"Ebay is the e-commerce leader in fraud, racism, and sexism! Lets not forget cyberterrorism!!! This company continues to profit from racist items being sold site wide. They will lie, deny, and extort you and your business any chance they get. Even when they are proven wrong they continue to lie. Ohhh did I forget eBay steals, Jesus how could I forget their top profit gainer- THEFT. Yes they steal, mangled payments are a horrible #$%$ compared to paypal. Customer service after you've been stolen from, racial insulted, and CYBERSTALKED. Sheer ineptitude. The combined IQ of the people in charge is that of a squirrel - trying to get straight answers on logical questions is impossible at some points."
eBay's numbers weren't bad....And then the company issued the horrible guidance. Ah well.
"having trouble getting yahoo to post my post. I wanted to post that I bought an item on april 29, well before this new payment process was effective. I did not get the item and requested a refund. the seller told me he processed a refund. I purchased using PayPal and as of this posting I still have not received my refund. ebay cannot be trusted. their software has too many glitches. prior to this new process paypal would have my refund posted in my account a week ago."
"I buy more on eBay than amazon. I get better pricing for the same items.They have a great deal with adidas, for example, where I save 50 % of the clothes I buy for me and my family. I am in the habit of checking eBay first , before I go anywhere else. With covid, earnings have to be huge by my estimation. I guess we'lll see real soon. Good luck longs."
goo news
Look at Amazon???? the one time??? Covid FLUKE is over??? Well???
The Bear is Winning!
"With people's stimulus running out, mortgage payments becoming unfrozen along student loans, people are going to be looking for a source of income if they are still out of a job for the time being. eBay is a great way to do that, and interest in eBay seems to be peaking again. Especially now more than ever before, people will be looking for some quick cash from selling things around their house. This looks like a golden opportunity IMO, and eBay could be making new highs for the time being. I'm top rated seller on eBay and have been using the platform since 2015, and it has given me an excellent source of income. eBay is undervalued at this price per share."
"Analyst believes Rev. To low.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian observed in a research note Tuesday that his proprietary tracking tool finds that weekly merchandise volumes have increased by double digits year over year for the past seven weeks in a row. He says volumes have come off their late April/early May peak, but that he now sees upside to his already above-consensus June-quarter estimates.Sebastian has been modeling June-quarter revenue of $2.68 billion, with gross merchandise value of $24.1 billion. In the March quarter, the company posted revenue of $2.4 billion and GMV of $21.3 billion. The company’s guidance for the June quarter is for revenue of $2.38 billion to $2.48 billion; Street consensus is at the top of the guidance range, at $2.48 billion.Sebastian’s stance in part reflects his bullish view of the e-commerce sector overall. He says data points he tracks “suggest healthy year-over-year e-commerce activity through May, albeit not at the peak volume days in late April and early May.” He adds that “positive e-commerce spending trends have extended well past initial stimulus payments,” asserting that there may be “pent-up demand among consumers helping to boost May volumes.”"
"Sellers, we are being ripped off!When a buyer cancels an order, sellers are not refunded the entire eBay fee. And according to an EcommerceBytes reader, that's not the only cost.When a buyer places an order, sellers enrolled in eBay managed payments pay a Final Value Fee (commission plus payment-processing fees) to eBay along with a 30-cent per-transaction fee.When an order is cancelled, eBay returns the buyer's payment and credits the seller for fees, but keeps the 30-cent fee."

"Yet another downgrade.This time Morgan Stanley downgrades them due to ""Deteriorating marketplace""""Expect little to no growth""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-downgraded-at-morgan-stanley-on-concerns-of-deterioration-2018-12-12"
This is just in sympathy with Amzn?
"EBay (EBAY -4.7%) CEO Devin Wenig takes to Twitter to respond to what's being considered something of a shot by Jeff Bezos in his annual letter to shareholders when he compared 20-year third-party seller growth sales on the two platforms (AMZN +52% vs. EBAY +20%).""While I appreciate the ink dedicated to @ebay from the ceo of the company not focused on competition, think I”ll dedicate my letter to customers, purpose and strategy. We don’t compete with our sellers. We don’t bundle endless services to create barriers to competition,"" tweets Wenig.Ebay places barriers to success , pay to play is Ebays goal, its like click bait at its best"
Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy)-37.40% that about sums up POS eBay
When they report earnings and going forward it becomes clear how bad the sales outlook is I would not at all be surprised if we see a one day drop of 20+% in the stock price.It takes a year to do so but if the USA drops out of the postal agreement and parcels from China are no longer subsidized then we can expect eBay to take another big hit. Company needs to clean house from top to bottom.
now all the ebay sellers that gave ebay their financial information will now reside in Norway. sellers should be proud to know their financials are now worldwide.
"Yeah right. stock may be fine but I am boycotting this company until they resolve the ""shill bidding"". Look into it folks. It's real. If this goes unresolved then ebay does not care about it's clients."
"I've been bitten by the Leatherman bug!So far it's been eBay all the way, I missed a few good deals on Mercari and will keep looking.I have 5 different models, 3 of which have been discontinued."
Ebay and Wish might merge together.CEOs have been meeting together.This would be huge!!!!
"Twenty-seven analysts forecast the average price in 12 months at $62.32 with a high forecast of $82.00 and a low forecast of $52.00. The average price target represents a 10.71% increase from the last price of $56.29. From those 27, 11 analysts rated ‘Buy’, 16 rated ‘Hold’ and none rated ‘Sell’, according to Tipranks.We think it is good to buy at the current level and target $64 as 50-day Moving Average and 100-200-day MACD Oscillator signals a strong buying opportunity."
Does eBay offer a buyer protection on their stock?
Alibaba will be added to the hangseng tech index fund. The index fund will need to buy alibaba stock. Stock will surge. $amzn $jd $bzun $ebay
"ebay is in full on epic fail mode. They just switched made a huge switch from PayPal centered payments to ebay managed payments and it was horrible. Seekers are losing money on transactions, waiting over a week for payments that used to happen in minutes and being forced to pay shipping out if their own pockets even when the buyer pays for the shipping. This is going to damage they're button line substantially"
In this stock is selling at the same price that was on September 1st 2016 how's that for growth
"So consumer sentiment is down, yet this is up and other retail stocks are down. I don't get it"
Aww yahoo won’t share the DAILY news article on ebay “cyberstalkers”. Just search it. Trash company with immoral and unethical CEO and employees.
will be above $70 next week.
Many sellers just are listing low end items for the most part. Never list an expensive item you would be willing lose. If you get scammed for a $25 item so be it. Don’t get hammered for a $200 item. eBay will most Always side with the buyer. Wait for the report this week. If they are up front with the true Sales numbers they will be lower
"The company's net income fell to $310 million, or 37 cents per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $721 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. This is a huge loss!!!!!"
"btw most upper management is leaving fraudBay. Harry Temkin The buyer experience guru lasted only 1 year. The writing is on the wall. More scandals, more fraud, worse buyer and seller experience, higher fees, less support, MORE LIES from Iannone, and a stock that frauds investors daily."
"EBAY is in trouble folks. Their treatment of sellers and ridiculous fee structure is starting to catch up with them. If you factor in Ebay seller fees along with PayPal fees, it literally makes more sense for sellers to use other avenues and that is why guidance is the way it is. Ebay could easily turn into the ecommerce version of Sears if they don't start making some very creative ways to reinvent themselves. The innovation they once had is now the status quo and Ebay has failed to keep evolving. Sellers are running away and trying other channels first and often they are getting decent prices without the Ebay selling hassle."
Ebays BOD
Ebay even let competitors sell items on the same pages that the listing sellers paid a fee for. Its like Dominos advertising in a Pizza Hut window. Yes they even did that.
"I too am off eBay as a seller. I hardly go to the website as a buyer now also. Here's something that might be interesting. How about PayPal opening up it's on auction site similar to what eBay was in the early days. PayPal would crush eBay in no time at all. PayPal certainly has the financial ability to do this. Just compare the two stocks eBay versus PayPal. How is this for a couple of names PAYBAY, AUCTPAL, PALSELL, AuctionPal.They already have all our account information set up, wow that would be fantastic I would sign up in a second."
eBay's new shipping page is another downgrade for sellers... Change for change sake is not good... Wake up eBay..... Don't try to change what already works
"I just bought 100 shares today, I hope to sell it off at least 200+"
The recent pullback has meant that eBay has fallen 24% in 2018.
"Who bought 3,741,031 shares of eBay after hours today?"
"Ebay frustrating sellers, will drive sales at Etsy. I have been a seller on ebay for 21 years. The restricted me in the last 8 days, they say I have had more complaints in last few weeks. Well there was a snow storm. Customer service can't help you, they say its a back office issue. They are dropping the normal bucks program. Good luck as an investment"
eBay = cyberterrorists

""We not only found new busy work that is guaranteed to consume hours of your time and produce zero positive improvements for you, but we found some new rules we can impose that will make your selling experience worse than it already is....

"I've been an eBay seller and buyer for the past 10 years and I am getting out because of their split from Paypal and their new ""managed payments"" policy.But above all, for security reasons. Paypal, or a Credit Card, act as a safeguard. You can put a limit to expenses and payments, or even block a card instantly with a phone call. But giving eBay access to your Bank account is extremely dangerous. Specially if you give a single company ALL your personal information, including a copy of your identity card with your photo.If ever there is a security breach, and eBay gets hacked, it's not only your email account that will be hacked: it's your whole identity and bank account that can be stolen!!!Don't forget that the danger is bigger for us Europeans, because we have proper Identity Cards with all our information, and not just a ""social security number"" as the americans! We cannot give away our personal information just like that, it's too dangerous. Get out ou eBay while you can!!!"
"Over the past five years, eBay’s total return has been more than 100% lower than peers and ~35% to ~65% lower than the technology indices. Moreover, eBay has declined 20% over the past year alone relative to a roughly flat equity market."
I expect EBAY to have blowout earnings when it reports on July 29. A lot of people are unemployed and sitting at home selling on Ebay.
"Yes, please continue to short eBay shares until you exhausted, but eBay management will back up their truck on buybacks with their billions of share repurchase authorized last quarter."
EBAY owns Paypal. Paypal will stop providing services to conservatives who open their mouths and call out the stolen election and such. There is an immense amount of opportunity for conservatives so take away market share from these woke companies that are leaving out half the population to find other services. I am thinking of starting a competing service to amazon that berates the dems and gets all the business from conservatives
"so many bashers on this board. keep bashing, the longs are making BIG BUCKS!"
"Isn't ebay, etsy, etc going to collapse next year with the new 1099-k reporting requirements. Small/Casual sellers who probably don't make anything after costs anyway are going to have to hire an accountant or go through headaches (end of the day just paying fees to ebay and not making any money anyway or finding out they haven't been or losing money). And then, why should they buy anything as well (if it is a total hassle to sell extras if you buy a lot of something, etc)."
how did it beat expectations by 7% but still go down?

"...EBay's stock falls after Deutsche Bank downgrade, on missed opportunity for strategic shiftTomi KilgoreUpdated Thu, January 28, 2021, 9:14 AM·1 min readEBAY-3.27%IBUY-0.67%^GSPC+0.98%0P00012B2W.TO-0.68%ETSY+4.67%Shares of eBay Inc. fell 0.9% in premarket trading Thursday, after the online retailer was downgraded by Deutsche Bank analyst Kunal Madhukar, who said the company's recent success may not last. Madhukar, who cut eBay's rating to hold from buy, said the unprecedented surge in e-commerce as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns led to opportunities for companies to carve out a ""unique niche"" that could become ""a sustainable competitive advantage"" post-COVID. Madhukar says Etsy Inc. is a good example, as management pivoted strategically by calling on its sellers to early to make facemasks, driving traffic and awareness. ""Yet for eBay, despite the platform benefitting modestly from the surging online shift in consumer demand, we have yet to see any strategic shift that could suggest the company is leveraging its incremental growth into a sustainable fundamental advantage,"" Madhukar wrote in a note to clients. EBay's stock has gained 61.1% over the past 12 months through Wednesday, while Etsy shares have soared 288.1%, the Amplify Online Retail ETF has run up 140.3% and the S&P 500 has gained 14.5%."
"dump paypal, create trading card and refurbished phones platform, wait for hundreds of millions to pour in - genius."
EBay will finalize the sale of its sprawling online cl#$%$ifieds business for $8-10 Billion. It's unmanaged and low profit business for Ebay. They will invest this money into main online marketplace which is their strength. This is a great decision. Ebay will do much better and will become high growth stock if they use this money well. Ebay's Marketplace business is better even for society. I'm sitting at 80% profit and will go long on this stock. Ebay should touch $65 this week.
YTD 34% and dividend.
"Top tips for selling your items on eBay. (1) Become a Chinese seller. (2) Reduce your profit margin to less than one-dollar per item. (3) Only use Buy It Now. Never list auctions due to Ebay throttling, which means that very few people will actually see your listing. (4) Accept ALL low-ball offers -- even if you're going to lose money -- because otherwise you'll never sell the item. (5) Complain to Ebay, which will deny the throttling of your listings. (6) Threaten to never buy anything on Ebay if your listings are not un-throttled. (7) Use Craigslist to sell your items. (8) When all this fails, as is the case with millions of Ebay sellers, simply quit the site and join a different online platform."
EBAY is so badly managed they keep suggesting I drop prices on items I am selling a week before Thanksgiving and Black Friday and a month before Christmas when most of the buying is supposed to take place. It is taking place too. Just not on EBAY.
Ebay has removed page view counts on unsold listings. It is intentional. Sellers believe it is so that you can't see the LOW number of view on items. This was only useful data on unsold listings. Used to adjust pricing or even decide if to relist.https://community.ebay.com/t5/Selling/Manage-ended-listings-page-no-longer-showing-views/td-p/28837521
How many of you know that ebays CEO is on the GM board of directors...makes sense now.https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2018/04/19/gm-board-ebay-ceo-devin-wenig/533000002/
"What a profoundly disappointing Q4 call... Its board and leaders are clearly disconnected from the reality of the company. Yes sales tax has provided a significant headwind this year, but it is not to be blamed for everything. Increasing margins via Promoted Listings sounds great to them I'm sure, but they fail to realize that this short term gain will kill eBay in the long run. How can your sellers provide a superior product/service if eBay is taking more of their margin? Pitting sellers against sellers to bid more margin away for listing placement is insanity, eBay's value proposition against other platforms is already severely faded. No amount of marketplace margin increase will make up revenues if GMV dries up. 100% of $0 is $0. And where is the marketing spend? They talked about being more efficient advertising eBay, great, but why then fire 200ppl, mostly from marketing? Marketing has produced some wonderful ads, you can see them on their YouTube channel, but have you seen them on TV or played before your last Netflix/Hulu show? No, no you haven't. eBay is quickly being forgotten. eBay needs a CEO that has proven themselves an effective seller on the platform. How else can you lead a company if you don't know your own service in and out like a seller would? We don't need a dividend or share buybacks fueled by debt, we need strategic change, fast. Considering a short here until I hear of a more competent new CEO, but not holding my breath, the previous boards haven't had a good track record picking them."
"There's literally zero advantage to neither buying nor selling on eBay now. Internet Sales Tax has leveled the playing field on new consumer goods. Resellers have many other outlets. eBay's new UI's are atrocious. eBay's new payment system alone is driving away small-time/hobby sellers. Their customer service remains bottom barrel. This upcoming earnings may still be buoyed by covid and the shut-in society, but by the year's end the miserable choices their management has made to the consumer experience will be felt greatly. mark my words."
"If you need me to inform you of any other fraudulent companies, You can find me on the $GM and $salesforce forum."
"this stock like csco orcl ibm, very solid results..."
nine billion adds to cap cash is King in a buyer's market. increase in margins add to 3 quarter earnings.

"As an owner of an eBay business, sales are up 190% from last year. Not really seeing a slow down in sales. Only if inventory levels get low."
Ebay joins the cancel culture. You can't sell out of print Dr. Seuss books. You can't make this stuff up.
"Neither Short nor Long - just an opinion | As a Seller and Buyer the site looks and feels the same as it did 10 years ago. The sellers panel is still convoluted and not as user friendly as an average 'off the shelf' CRM. As a Buyer, yes there are still a wide range of items if you are a collector of Comics and nick/nacks. Other items such as beauty products aren't discounted because if the Seller is also on Amazon the price has to exceed or match the Amazon price. | Bottom Line: In the 10+ years that I've had my account, it hasn't changed much on either side of the aisle. That, in and of itself, tells you something about how they run the business. No innovation, just maintenance. There's a reason ETSY/OSTK probably took 50% -60% of their market share."
Honestly better that Amazon has lower revs. Shows that competition is increasing and that $SHOP $EBAY and more are taking market share.

I'm planning to hold this for 20+ years. Hoping for $1000 someday.
They lost a lot of business requiring sellers to link a bank account. Who wants to link their bank account with all the hacking that goes on these days?

"Here we go, just turned Red. Couldn't even hold Green for 20 minutes. Earnings are very weak, market was expecting blowout beats and Ebay delivered nothing even close."
"Why is the Ebay leadership purposely destroying the company? I'm been selling on Ebay for 19 years. Here's what happened to me today. As a longtime seller, I've learned what sells and what doesn't. I just had a very high-demand item not get a single bid on an auction. Normally, it should have gotten at least 100 views from potential buyers. During the holiday season, 200 views would be normal. So many views did my ""popular"" item get? A grand total of five. Yes, just five! Hey Ebay -- tell me again why I should buy anything on your website when you're purposely sabotaging my business and livelihood?"
This stock will tank buyers and sellers fed up with eBay 
China comes first says eBay!

One of my best performing stocks today. This company has been undervalued for a long time.

"This is an ""e"" stock, and its P/E is so low. It should jump to another height soon."
"Gonna be selling short a lot of shares of EBAY just before market close today. This is a very specific earnings play. I am confident that with the lock-downs lifted in recent months, people will be spending more money on in-person shopping, and less on an internet-exclusive platform like Ebay. The earnings numbers coming out in a few minutes should be weaker than expected, and with the future looking very uncertain, EBAY should sell off significantly in direct response to this ER. Good Luck!"
Go to their facebook page and ask a question about how to dispute tracking rate metric and they delete it. WHY do I have to go to facebook to ask ?'s? The ONLY option with EBAY is via phone. They do not want anything documented. That's right - sellers cannot email or log a ticket with a company in 2018.
Ebay next earnings will be strong. They are not having the supply chain issues like amazon. I own the stock and will buy the dip for a long term hold.
"So far in the pre-market session EBAY is acting very weak, but still holding up quite well. On very low volume, we have consistent bids in the mid-upper $66's. That is down quite a bit from yesterday's close, but does it accurately reflect the upcoming regular session action?? I do NOT think so. Serious traders wait for the regular session to begin. EBAY will see STRONG volume right at the open and for the first 20 minutes of the regular session. I predict a wave of sellers smothering this stock to the downside within 20 minutes of the open. We could go above $68 in the first 2 or 3 minutes, as wild swings are common as a stock opens immediately after earnings release. But it will not hold. A selling wave will take over, traders with profit looking to get out, traders with a loss fearful of a much bigger loss if they stay in, short sellers seeing a quick daytrading opportunity, etc... I expect this wave of selling pressure to take us down to the $65 level. And then for the rest of the day every upside pop from bargain hunters will be challenged by steady downside pressure, that is likely to gradually keep depressing the stock price down... I did just polish my crystal ball, so let us see how well it is working. My plan is to stay Short until later in the afternoon, though I did already Sell Short a few shares of DIS here in the pre-market, DIS will be my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, gonna throw all my hard capital Short on DIS before market close today. Good Luck! :-)"
"I used to love eBay, but greedy management has made a fatal move that will finish this online selling platform. From now on listing fees will be deducted from sellers BEFORE the item sells. This represents an upfront investment most casual sellers will simply shy away from. Enter Mercari a new online selling platform with its own app ready to absorb all the business eBay is now turning away. Very sad for eBay it’s an abhorrent move on their part that will inevitably spell disaster for the company."
Love EBay. The stock has made me 24% ROI since April. Good luck shorts. EBay will continue to be a leader in the industry.
"Ebay??? lots of history??...but now its History? as management blinded and living in the past ??/ can not understand EBAY is NOT AMAZON!!! never will be??? Ebay must have SELLERS!!! Sellers must ajke enough $$$ NOT TO QUIT LIKE ME!!! After 21 YEARS??? Ebay GREEDY management can not evolve??? can NOT SEE the ""forest for the Trees?""...Just pure LUCK the AMAZON has not hardly tried??? to step on EBAY like a #$%$ roach...they have system??? to handle it??? payment system???

"I would encourage investors to research eBay Discussion Boards or ecommercebytes.Sellers are infuriated with this company. I sell on eBay and invest. I would never touch eBay as a position to hold.Just refer to this Wednesday's weekly chat with eBay Staff. The entire thread is sellers expressing an array of issues. The company may do good short term but they are burning bridges with sellers.Take it for what you will but I am a 6 figure seller (barely) nearing closing our store on eBay for Shopify. We aren't alone. Do whatever you want with your money, but I'd encourage you to explore this angle."
Shill bidding hahaha that has been happening since eBay opened in 1998. Corrupt to the core.
"EBAY investors have enjoyed significant investment returns over the past several years. However, operating profits have been lackluster, and the balance sheet has materially deteriorated throughout this timeframe. This is very concerning as we head into the later stages of the economic cycle, especially since management seems focused on compensating equity shareholders at the expense of the balance sheet."
eBay (38 billion) valued at 1/4 of Shopify (155 billion)? So many irrational valuations in today's market. Where is Eugene Fama?
Its 2 months until Christmas and this is the slowest sales I have seen in 3 years for ebay as a seller and I have hundreds of items listed. I barely get one sale a week now. I used to get dozens a week before they changed everything around.

Today's activity is a coordinated attack to get very cheap stock under the guise of questionable 22 earnings. Why would management be buying stock back if things were soo bad ? Where can you buy a business today at 8 times earnings. This is a real joke but gives shareholders an opportunity to take advantage.
EBAY Sales? What sales? The one sale I had this week cancelled and I had to pay for a label out of my pocket. Meanwhile sales are brisk on other sites. They continue to delete my listings I worked on simply because I wont pay them each month for them when other sites dont charge monthly listing fees. So why bother? The customers just arent there anymore for me to care. No free listings ebay? Fine. Let the chips fall as they may.
I have a feeling eBay is gonna pay big time for this newest lawsuit. Wenig is implicated. I know 2000% he is guilty.
"New LOD right here, the first of many to come. Gonna be lots of selling pressure all day long, exactly as my Crystal Ball prophesized... :-)"
"Look for Ebay to lose a ton of sellers next year, next year anyone making more than $600 will get a 1099K form. It will sure be interesting what happens then."
"I've always preferred using eBay over Amazon. eBay's website is easier to use, and the prices are usually cheaper for identical items. I bought eBay stock and have been waiting for an Amazon-like increase in value. Could this be the start??? PS: It's my best performing stock lately (By far)."
"PWCC is creating a buy it now style marketplace option soon (i..e which would compete with ebay, etc). hmmm"
eBay always goes down after earnings and moves back up. Just wait for earnings to be out before jumping in
"Ebay sellers are leaving in droves, revenue will drop considerably on next earnings date i predict a pps shave from 60;s to the teens."
"Couldn't believe that the price to earnings ratio of EBAY is this low - in the single digits. Wow... people haven't really noticed how valuable this company is. Bought a ton with this kind of earnings and outlook, EBAY is a steal. There are a lot of companies out there with really absurd multiples and very very expensive. EBAY has improved efficiencies, offerings, and sales/profit. I wouldn't be surprised if this is over a hondred dollars in a few months."
"So finally we see how years of completely soaking sellers with increased fees has hurt ebay. To keep buyers from jumping to the big river or etsy, ebay has offers of 15-20% off site wide regularly (not on gcs or real estate but almost everything). Buyers now know WAIT FOR A PROMO! Sellers don't eat this 15-20% reduction, ebay does. Then to get sellers to sell (finally they notice if sellers don't sell, buyers can't buy), they offer promos to sell. I NEVER sell without a free listing promo and that apparently wasn't enough. Regular promos for 10% back for items sold come around. Just got another one today on all my accounts and of course I have free listings to list with. Sellers know don't sell without a promo (the smart ones do anyway). I ONLY buy with a coupon and I ONLY sell with a promo."

"Ebay's deal to sell its classified business to Adevinta was finalised today for $2.5 billion in cash and a 44% equity stake in Adevinta. I think Ebay did well out of this sale, classifieds used to only account for a small percentage of Ebay's revenue. It also puts Adevinta in a very strong position, with fewer competitors in many countries, and it will likely be able to raise its fees, Adevinta now owns a very strong set of brands and websites. Ebay also announced that it is increasing estimated share buyback this year to $5 billion."
