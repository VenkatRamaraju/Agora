"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
Its 2 months until Christmas and this is the slowest sales I have seen in 3 years for ebay as a seller and I have hundreds of items listed. I barely get one sale a week now. I used to get dozens a week before they changed everything around.
"EBAY: Yes...the reasons to buy and hold.- Go-to site for recent renewed collectibles craze- Also...best site to buy hard-to-get items, in-demand Christmas gifts, and out-of-stock necessities due to supply-chain disruptions.-They took over their own payment system and now will take in what PayPal used to earn from transactions.- New Marketplace for retailers-Prioritized sellers-New recognition of advertising potential like other platforms with big reach ( AMZN, FB,etc.)...all this growth potential in a stock with very little risk. Find a tech or retail company...or almost any stock for that matter, with a PE under 5...that has such a long growth runway ahead of them.This company ( and stock) just keeps quietly and consistently powering ahead...with very little risk."
"eBay's metrics are screwed up because of Q2 of 2021. Check the quarterly chart on the Financials tab here. Earnings exceed revenue by a long shot because eBay sold 80% of eBay Korea business to Emart for approximately $3 billion and completed the sale of the Classifieds business to Adevinta on June 24th for $13.3 billion. eBay also entered into an agreement to sell approximately 135 million shares of eBay’s Adevinta stock to Permira for over $2.4 billion, reducing their ownership of Adevinta to 33%. So when we see a low P/E we are not getting the accurate picture. Forward P/E is over 18. Once the Q2 earnings fall off the schedule for the TTM, we will see a clearer picture."
Easy 85+ stock.
EBay will finalize the sale of its sprawling online cl#$%$ifieds business for $8-10 Billion. It's unmanaged and low profit business for Ebay. They will invest this money into main online marketplace which is their strength. This is a great decision. Ebay will do much better and will become high growth stock if they use this money well. Ebay's Marketplace business is better even for society. I'm sitting at 80% profit and will go long on this stock. Ebay should touch $65 this week.
All that greed will hurt! Never buy high or hypes!
Shattered earnings 
"EBay (EBAY -4.7%) CEO Devin Wenig takes to Twitter to respond to what's being considered something of a shot by Jeff Bezos in his annual letter to shareholders when he compared 20-year third-party seller growth sales on the two platforms (AMZN +52% vs. EBAY +20%).""While I appreciate the ink dedicated to @ebay from the ceo of the company not focused on competition, think I”ll dedicate my letter to customers, purpose and strategy. We don’t compete with our sellers. We don’t bundle endless services to create barriers to competition,"" tweets Wenig.Ebay places barriers to success , pay to play is Ebays goal, its like click bait at its best"
I'm planning to hold this for 20+ years. Hoping for $1000 someday.
"With people's stimulus running out, mortgage payments becoming unfrozen along student loans, people are going to be looking for a source of income if they are still out of a job for the time being. eBay is a great way to do that, and interest in eBay seems to be peaking again. Especially now more than ever before, people will be looking for some quick cash from selling things around their house. This looks like a golden opportunity IMO, and eBay could be making new highs for the time being. I'm top rated seller on eBay and have been using the platform since 2015, and it has given me an excellent source of income. eBay is undervalued at this price per share."
I love ebay. Never shop Amazon.
eBay's like a gallon of milk that's been sitting on the counter for a few days.
"I am a novice, so this is just an observation I will make. I have been a full-time eBay seller for 18 years. Quite a few years back one of the new CEO's raised the fees for sellers. That was pretty much the big change at the time. Then, as now, Amazon was always casting a shadow. Three months or so later, eBay announced revenue increases that seemed to match the increase in seller fees. The CEO was hailed a genius and the stock shot up. Not a very sustainable method to increase revenues. It is important to keep sellers, especially with more platforms to sell on that are now available. eBay recently went to ""managed payments."" That is a .30 per transaction fee plus higher final value fees for each transaction. No more PayPal. I feel like the same scenario is happening. It is a little more expensive for sellers, but not enough to chase us off, and more revenue for eBay. They switched us to ""managed payments"" in the beginning of August. Also, there is a waiting period for sellers to get their money now. It is not immediate like it was with PayPal. Millions of dollars are being held in ""pending"" everyday. Wouldn't that add to interest income?"
"Sellers are fed up because of all of the extra work to even make a listing, and buyers have drifted away because of the poor search results (and ebay's insistence on shoving non-related items into a search) which has taken the, shall we say, 'joy' out of it. (All that matters is the stock price, though, to the ones making the decisions.)"
Love EBay. The stock has made me 24% ROI since April. Good luck shorts. EBay will continue to be a leader in the industry.
If the P/E ratio is correct this is going to $100 next week.In fact $200 would be a better estimate.
"A sincere question. This company sells things they do not buy, produce, store or transport: how is it they do not make more money than they do? Is the organization bloated?"
Ebay = the wealthmakers
Ebay is OVER..23 years on ? former power seller... Now??? they want my Bank Routing number??? to a company??? impossible to get a hold of??? INSANE to give routing number...IMPORTANT...once some one has routing number!!! NO stop PAYMENT??? must close and open??? with NEW horrible fees?? returns??? you could BOUNCE checks at bank??? and now BANK fees...Guess i have sold LAST ebay item??? only thing keeping ebay is the COVID...forcing folks to sell for money??? not go to store???this will PASS as will EBAY...watch number of sellers DROP big time??? as insane to give EBAY bank Routing number
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"PWCC shill bidding destroys all reputations involved. The collectible business is based on trust. Not only does Ebay lose a huge client here, but the collectible world should get rocked here as well. Sell in the short term."
I will be looking to Cover my EBAY Short tomorrow at the $62 level during the regular session. Expecting a major sell-off right at market open as traders look to get out and Short interest increases.
"I buy more on eBay than amazon. I get better pricing for the same items.They have a great deal with adidas, for example, where I save 50 % of the clothes I buy for me and my family. I am in the habit of checking eBay first , before I go anywhere else. With covid, earnings have to be huge by my estimation. I guess we'lll see real soon. Good luck longs."
"There's literally zero advantage to neither buying nor selling on eBay now. Internet Sales Tax has leveled the playing field on new consumer goods. Resellers have many other outlets. eBay's new UI's are atrocious. eBay's new payment system alone is driving away small-time/hobby sellers. Their customer service remains bottom barrel. This upcoming earnings may still be buoyed by covid and the shut-in society, but by the year's end the miserable choices their management has made to the consumer experience will be felt greatly. mark my words."
I dont understand how a company can be worth multi-billions of dollar but the stock stays $24-29 for 15 years can the SEC please explain it to us?
"The company's net income fell to $310 million, or 37 cents per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $721 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. This is a huge loss!!!!!"
"This company is slowly bleeding. Sellers are fleeing to better platforms, buyers aren't on anymore. Too expensive."

"Why would people use $wish platform, if they can buy, the same stuff on $EBAY ? And buy ebay stock. Ebay is established platform. You guys looking at the low price, not at the quality..."
Today's activity is a coordinated attack to get very cheap stock under the guise of questionable 22 earnings. Why would management be buying stock back if things were soo bad ? Where can you buy a business today at 8 times earnings. This is a real joke but gives shareholders an opportunity to take advantage.
"Revenues increased 18% year-over-year to $2.9 billion.Net income was $746 million, or $1.05 per share, compared to $402 million, or $0.46 per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.08"
"Who bought 3,741,031 shares of eBay after hours today?"
One of my best performing stocks today. This company has been undervalued for a long time.
eBay just completed a fall update for sellers. The update has more glitches than imaginable and this is the fourth quarter. It will cost lost sales for weeks.
"Who uses EBAY anyway? Oh yea bunch of old timers. Easy short, nothing special, easy 5K. Keep supporting junk stocks :). Have a nice day, thanks for playing."
"btw most upper management is leaving fraudBay. Harry Temkin The buyer experience guru lasted only 1 year. The writing is on the wall. More scandals, more fraud, worse buyer and seller experience, higher fees, less support, MORE LIES from Iannone, and a stock that frauds investors daily."
Still tons of room to grow. Will hold for another 25% 
this used to be a good site for vintage cool stuff but they got greedy and charge too much for selling.
"Shorting here. I was a ebay powerseller for years then left as fees were to high. Tried to jump back (selling CGC graded coins), and I just can't do it. Sold 100 ounces of 2004 Silver Eagles in rolls and buyer complained that 2-3 had patina. I explained it was normal and e-bay just fully refunded them even with good pictures and description. Left me on the hook for shipping as well It took me weeks to get the final value fees back. This is just in the coin section, but the variety and sellers are really half of what it was just a few short years ago and like a quarter of what it was when I was a power seller. They are trying to go head to head with Walmart and Amazon, but what made them special is the unique items."
"Why would anyone buy junk from scammers that you have a very high probability of not receiving and less likely to get a refund. Ebay is on the way to making Craigslist seem like a great place to shop. And since they bought PayPal it is also on its way to the bottom. My latest and LAST purchase was with a seller, easysale321. No product and no refund. PayPal refused request for refund. They obviously don't want my business."
"Love this stock. Already up 35% and expect it to grow to 90.00 soon.. with inflation, eBay is a value buy - and you can buy and sell new&used goods on here."
sell
eBay's numbers weren't bad....And then the company issued the horrible guidance. Ah well.
"So finally we see how years of completely soaking sellers with increased fees has hurt ebay. To keep buyers from jumping to the big river or etsy, ebay has offers of 15-20% off site wide regularly (not on gcs or real estate but almost everything). Buyers now know WAIT FOR A PROMO! Sellers don't eat this 15-20% reduction, ebay does. Then to get sellers to sell (finally they notice if sellers don't sell, buyers can't buy), they offer promos to sell. I NEVER sell without a free listing promo and that apparently wasn't enough. Regular promos for 10% back for items sold come around. Just got another one today on all my accounts and of course I have free listings to list with. Sellers know don't sell without a promo (the smart ones do anyway). I ONLY buy with a coupon and I ONLY sell with a promo."
"...EBay's stock falls after Deutsche Bank downgrade, on missed opportunity for strategic shiftTomi KilgoreUpdated Thu, January 28, 2021, 9:14 AM·1 min readEBAY-3.27%IBUY-0.67%^GSPC+0.98%0P00012B2W.TO-0.68%ETSY+4.67%Shares of eBay Inc. fell 0.9% in premarket trading Thursday, after the online retailer was downgraded by Deutsche Bank analyst Kunal Madhukar, who said the company's recent success may not last. Madhukar, who cut eBay's rating to hold from buy, said the unprecedented surge in e-commerce as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns led to opportunities for companies to carve out a ""unique niche"" that could become ""a sustainable competitive advantage"" post-COVID. Madhukar says Etsy Inc. is a good example, as management pivoted strategically by calling on its sellers to early to make facemasks, driving traffic and awareness. ""Yet for eBay, despite the platform benefitting modestly from the surging online shift in consumer demand, we have yet to see any strategic shift that could suggest the company is leveraging its incremental growth into a sustainable fundamental advantage,"" Madhukar wrote in a note to clients. EBay's stock has gained 61.1% over the past 12 months through Wednesday, while Etsy shares have soared 288.1%, the Amplify Online Retail ETF has run up 140.3% and the S&P 500 has gained 14.5%."

"I’ve been a seller on eBay for 2 decades and never had bad feedback , always did my best to satisfy my customers … a month ago some buyer with only 3 feedbacks comes along and dings me with a negative and eBay wouldn’t remove even though I was in the right. I told eBay “eBay sellers are also eBay buyers and buy a lot off eBay etc”… I’m no longer buying anything off eBay” They can keep satisfying their 3 feedback something for nothing loser buyers .. hopefully all the sellers do the same.

eBay reached an all time high at 78.61
Ebay next earnings will be strong. They are not having the supply chain issues like amazon. I own the stock and will buy the dip for a long term hold.

Poor @see literally. Sad troll ebay cheerleader
They lost a lot of business requiring sellers to link a bank account. Who wants to link their bank account with all the hacking that goes on these days?
is ebay going to be investigated along with PWCC? didn't they have some type of partnership? not good imho
somebody tell me just ONE TIME eBay held a 6% gain on the day. I'll wait
"eBay said to me to wait a package due COVID delays. When I want my money back, eBay says I wait too long. PayPal offer similar response. The seller juneyear9 don't give my money back. Not obliged, not refund. I can't leave even a feedback. One #$%$ proteged by eBay and PayPal. Don't buy from this seller or eBay."
People you can say whatever you want about how eBay is over valued. The truth is the whole market is over valued. eBay is actually under valued compared to other established e- commerce stocks. It is under-valued simply because the other stocks are WAY over valued. Investors are realizing that and buying to close the gap. That’s why I see eBay stock will continue to rise so long the others are in cloud 9!
"Over the past five years, eBay’s total return has been more than 100% lower than peers and ~35% to ~65% lower than the technology indices. Moreover, eBay has declined 20% over the past year alone relative to a roughly flat equity market."
I don't think that EBAY has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
GAAP Earnings and income loss 50%
"So consumer sentiment is down, yet this is up and other retail stocks are down. I don't get it"
"I used to love eBay, but greedy management has made a fatal move that will finish this online selling platform. From now on listing fees will be deducted from sellers BEFORE the item sells. This represents an upfront investment most casual sellers will simply shy away from. Enter Mercari a new online selling platform with its own app ready to absorb all the business eBay is now turning away. Very sad for eBay it’s an abhorrent move on their part that will inevitably spell disaster for the company."
It seems EBay needs to change its business model.
eBay (38 billion) valued at 1/4 of Shopify (155 billion)? So many irrational valuations in today's market. Where is Eugene Fama?
first class shipping going way up in the new year.10 -15% + implementation of zonal charging. That will price me out of many product because the hina vendors will still be able to ship the same items for a cost of 20 cents complements of our USPS that carries their items for next to nothing
eBay probably buried itself with the recent move to stop using PayPal and move to Pioneer instead...

"With a p/e less than 5, and the growth rate it has...why would anyone sell this stock?"
"I would encourage investors to research eBay Discussion Boards or ecommercebytes.Sellers are infuriated with this company. I sell on eBay and invest. I would never touch eBay as a position to hold.Just refer to this Wednesday's weekly chat with eBay Staff. The entire thread is sellers expressing an array of issues. The company may do good short term but they are burning bridges with sellers.Take it for what you will but I am a 6 figure seller (barely) nearing closing our store on eBay for Shopify. We aren't alone. Do whatever you want with your money, but I'd encourage you to explore this angle."
"EBAY is in trouble folks. Their treatment of sellers and ridiculous fee structure is starting to catch up with them. If you factor in Ebay seller fees along with PayPal fees, it literally makes more sense for sellers to use other avenues and that is why guidance is the way it is. Ebay could easily turn into the ecommerce version of Sears if they don't start making some very creative ways to reinvent themselves. The innovation they once had is now the status quo and Ebay has failed to keep evolving. Sellers are running away and trying other channels first and often they are getting decent prices without the Ebay selling hassle."
Shill bidding hahaha that has been happening since eBay opened in 1998. Corrupt to the core.
Karma for turning their backs on sellers
eBay is down 4.97% to 73.80
Lol. People need to chill. This happens every time ebay releases earnings. It will bounce back. Book mark this post.
$EBAY Target Raised by Robert W Baird In-Line » Outperform USD 70 » USD 80
"So much fud all over the message boards, look for news in these places not advice. Anyone with a brain can view historical post earnings behavior of eBay, or any company , and how the performance is impacted by competitors or economic circumstances sundry. Some of you really astound me with the nonsense you spout in these comments for real."
"Oh look, FeeBay is going down....enjoy cons."
So many buyers waiting for the right competitor to come along as at least a partial replacement for eBay.
"Couldn't believe that the price to earnings ratio of EBAY is this low - in the single digits. Wow... people haven't really noticed how valuable this company is. Bought a ton with this kind of earnings and outlook, EBAY is a steal. There are a lot of companies out there with really absurd multiples and very very expensive. EBAY has improved efficiencies, offerings, and sales/profit. I wouldn't be surprised if this is over a hondred dollars in a few months."

"I bought it on Mercari, it was cheaper than eBay."
"Yeah right. stock may be fine but I am boycotting this company until they resolve the ""shill bidding"". Look into it folks. It's real. If this goes unresolved then ebay does not care about it's clients."
Why are buyer payments not automatic while seller Buy It Now relisting for a fee is mandatory? Is this the way to grow sellers? So many competing advertising streams make selling invisible. Bloated headcount costs money and drives up fees. My long term target is in the single digits.
Better than expected earnings
"i always hated ebay. they rip you off with 10% fee. try swappa to sell your phone, they only charge like 25 bucks fee"
Why the heck does Ebay of all stocks have such wild swings? 12% holding in SVCTF my largest holding. Fund at 45% discount another way to play Ebay.
some analysts have raised their price target on ebay. i don' think they realize the seller exodus that will take place next year once the cash app law takes effect

eBay is up 4.92% to 75.97
"Lots of analysts weighing in with mostly bullish opinions on the future of EBAY. But the most sensible one is right here:eBay (EBAY) PT Raised to $65 at Mizuho SecuritiesAugust 12, 2021 6:36 AM EDTMizuho Securities analyst James Lee raised the price target on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) to $65.00 (from $63.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating.------------------------------That is his price target 12 months out, for August 2022, and it makes perfect sense. EBAY was overvalued prior to yesterday's earnings release, and is just as overvalued now, given yesterday's ER numbers. It should be trading today in the low $60's, at best, were it not for the Irrational Exuberance of the market as a whole."
Short this stock people
EBAY popped yesterday for no reason at all. Now it's gonna drop. There is no future for this company. They self destructed with EBAY payments and whatever is left of them will be finished off Jan 1 when the new IRS reporting rules kick in.
"Sara, is eBay $20 yet?"
"Sara, have you seen $20 around lately? I can't seem to locate him. PS: Did you buy any DWAC yesterday?"
"If anyone wants to buy PINS for Ad data, Guess who else they likely are looking at ? EBAY thanks Apple ."
"Ebay frustrating sellers, will drive sales at Etsy. I have been a seller on ebay for 21 years. The restricted me in the last 8 days, they say I have had more complaints in last few weeks. Well there was a snow storm. Customer service can't help you, they say its a back office issue. They are dropping the normal bucks program. Good luck as an investment"
"sell sell sell, sell everything u guys have, sell ur house too"
will be in 75 next week
eBay is officially now a long term hold growth stock.
"I stoped selling on eBay ever since they changed the payout method, there’s a bunch of other people I know that have done the same "
EBay says its Managed Payments platform is now live in all markets and is on track to process over 90% of on-platform volume.
"I am a 24 year eBayer who is initiating a lawsuit. My account has been locked for no reason. Been going on for months. Can't be the only one. You lose a 24-year buyer who has spent in excess of .5M, your doors are closing. If there was any rationality to this market I would take a huge short position."
eBay always goes down after earnings and moves back up. Just wait for earnings to be out before jumping in
$EBAY Target Raised by Benchmark Buy USD 79 » USD 85 Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 78 » USD 79Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Neutral USD 63 » USD 65 Target Raised by Bank of America Neutral USD 68 » USD 70 Target Lowered by Piper Sandler Overweight USD 81 » USD 79 Maintains Credit Suisse Outperform USD 80 » USD 81
why the big drop after good earnings report? doesn't make sence
"Once you have linked your bank account to Ebay the only way to undo it is to completely close the account. You lose feedback and everything. You can add another and delete the old one, but you can't just stop selling and use the account for purchases. What brainiac came up with that idea?"
"Neither Short nor Long - just an opinion | As a Seller and Buyer the site looks and feels the same as it did 10 years ago. The sellers panel is still convoluted and not as user friendly as an average 'off the shelf' CRM. As a Buyer, yes there are still a wide range of items if you are a collector of Comics and nick/nacks. Other items such as beauty products aren't discounted because if the Seller is also on Amazon the price has to exceed or match the Amazon price. | Bottom Line: In the 10+ years that I've had my account, it hasn't changed much on either side of the aisle. That, in and of itself, tells you something about how they run the business. No innovation, just maintenance. There's a reason ETSY/OSTK probably took 50% -60% of their market share."
"Ebay should go back to the old days model. Low fees, let users deal with the taxes, etc.Ebay usage would soar 500%"

Sitting pretty at a 45% gain right now from buying earlier this year. If only it wasn’t pennies to most of you with my roughly 1000 initial investment
"Pam Omidyar sold $1.04 million in (EBAY) stock on the open market last week, her first such transaction in more than a decade. This year has been a wipeout for eBay stock."
"I used to sell a lot on ebay, 1000's of items per year, but I stopped using ebay last year because their fees were just too high, plus they were deleting auctions based on violations of their policies that had nothing to do with the item I was selling. An example is a vintage emergency beacon from the 1950's, they cancelled the auction and gave a strike because they labeled the 1950's item as a ""restricted police item"". A 1950's old light lol. Anyways I have saved a fortune by leaving ebay and using other sites, and I still get the same buy price I expect too, but thankfully I don't have to pay the crazy ebay fees nor paypal fees. Old school tech companies totally out of touch and greedy, it'll be their end lol."
Ebay even let competitors sell items on the same pages that the listing sellers paid a fee for. Its like Dominos advertising in a Pizza Hut window. Yes they even did that.

"I stopped using ebay when they changed the way you navigate their site, and changed to ebay payments. It's really a pita to sell on ebay anymore. Next year, any sales over $600 will be automatically reported to the IRS. Who wants to explain to the IRS that the item your selling on ebay is your used property and you shouldn't owe taxes. Next year, no one is going to sell on ebay anymore. There are lots of reasons for this stock to go down."
"Top tips for selling your items on eBay. (1) Become a Chinese seller. (2) Reduce your profit margin to less than one-dollar per item. (3) Only use Buy It Now. Never list auctions due to Ebay throttling, which means that very few people will actually see your listing. (4) Accept ALL low-ball offers -- even if you're going to lose money -- because otherwise you'll never sell the item. (5) Complain to Ebay, which will deny the throttling of your listings. (6) Threaten to never buy anything on Ebay if your listings are not un-throttled. (7) Use Craigslist to sell your items. (8) When all this fails, as is the case with millions of Ebay sellers, simply quit the site and join a different online platform."
Why is this stock going down when the PE ratio is so low? Thanks if you know the answer.
Anybody have a legitimate reason why the stock is up 5%
"This is one of the biggest ebay frauds:Alexander Gifford filed a federal lawsuit against eBay Inc. on Wednesday. The lawsuit states the basis for federal jurisdiction is “double taxation.”The seller is seeking relief, writing: “Return of all funds collected by eBay, Inc. on used goods through double taxation.”The seller sets out his argument in the filing’s Statement of Claim as follows:“The argument is that once you have purchased something legally at retail, which would include a sales tax, it is then yours to do with what you choose. The imposition of taxes again on the same asset at two different points of time would actually be the definition of double taxation. EBay, Inc. is collecting taxes on used assets which at the time of original point of sale a tax was collected, hence, the causation of this lawsuit.“In most cases this tax lower boundary of profit is negligible and the profit is not big enough to have a tax imposed on it. An EBay fee, a transaction fee, a sales tax, and then increased shipping costs makes the argument that something is awry and needs correction.“Attempting to make up deficits through a taxation without adequate representation starts to sound like a constitutional crisis.”Gifford v. eBay, Inc. was filed in Eastern Michigan District Court, case 2:21-mc-50359."
I used sell on Ebay. It's no longer an auction site. Any person can complain for any reason and then the seller gets stuck. Fees take a big chunk of your money. I just cant sell on Ebay anymore. It was good once but Amazon eating their lunch
got myself a nice Put. yyesssssir
where are the earnings??
Powerful break out. 80 within sites.
"Let me describe one of the ways that eBay makes it easy for buyers to scam sellers and steal items, and the company is doing absolutely nothing about it. I fell victim to this. It is also very simple to do:1. The buyer claims that a local pickup only item, which is too large and heavy for shipping, is not as described even when there is nothing wrong with it. 2. eBay accepts the not as described claim at face value (even if there is photo proof otherwise) and the only option for the seller is to accept the return and produce a return shipping label, otherwise the buyer gets the money back AND keeps the item.3. Since it is impossible to create a shipping label for an oversized item (e.g. outdoor patio furniture set or extra large TV etc.) eBay will refund the money AND allow the scammer to keep the item which is in perfectly good condition to begin with.I talked with customer service about 10 times when this happened. They repeat like a broken record that I have to create a return shipping label. Then I repeat back that it is too large for shipping, that's why it was local pickup only. Then they repeat back the same as before. I lose my money and the item, scammer wins. eBay knowingly facilitates the crime.SELL this stock. This company has no morals."
no one wants to sell on ebay any more as fees get too expensive - no revenue no profit stock plunges
"Don’t buy from eBay. You may end up like me.- not receiving the product, and not getting a refund! I purchased 2 books from eBay on 8/19/2021 from a seller called worldofbooksinc. Soon, the seller admitted that they do not have the books. I initially filed a dispute with Paypal for the entire amount. However, upon learning that the seller is cooperative and willing to refund me, I cancelled the case with Paypal on 8/24/2021. I waited patiently for the refund from the seller. However, after several emails with the seller, they indicated that they authorized the refund, but eBay is not willing to process it due to the case I filed with Paypal. I called eBay a 4 times trying to explain that the case with Paypal was closed on 8/24/2021 and tried to resolve this issue. During the first two calls, eBay said they would look into it and get back to me, but I never heard back. During the 3rd call, the eBay representative said they could refund me if they could confirm the case was closed with Paypal. We then had a conference call with Paypal on 9/20/2021. On the call, Paypal directly confirmed to eBay that the case with Paypal was closed on 8/24/2021. On 9/27/2021, after again not hearing back from eBay, I called the 4th time. This time, eBay told me that there is nothing they can do to help me and they would not give me refund, even though the seller authorized the refund and Paypal confirmed the case was closed with them on 8/24/2021.There is no reason to withhold my money when I did not receive what I purchased. Further, if eBay is so adamant about not giving me the refund, why waste my time? Why give me hope during the first 3 calls? Why hold a conference call with Paypal, wasting my time and Paypal's time? I am very disturbed by what happened with this purchase. Not only I lost my money on eBay, I also lost hours of my time, and most importantly my confidence in eBay. I understand $32.36 is not a lot of money, but it is a matter of principle. People who purchase from eBay should either get the products or their money money back! ISave yourself the money, time and headache, don’t buy from eBay!"
"Isn't ebay, etsy, etc going to collapse next year with the new 1099-k reporting requirements. Small/Casual sellers who probably don't make anything after costs anyway are going to have to hire an accountant or go through headaches (end of the day just paying fees to ebay and not making any money anyway or finding out they haven't been or losing money). And then, why should they buy anything as well (if it is a total hassle to sell extras if you buy a lot of something, etc)."
"Earnings out, and not nearly good enough to keep this Green tomorrow. This initial upside move we are seeing in the AH session will be swiftly followed by a major drop tomorrow. Happy to be Short a lot of shares at $68.01.Ebay (EBAY) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.99 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.99 per share on revenue of $3.0 billion. The company said it expects third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 to $0.96 per share on revenue of $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion, including Korea. The current consensus earnings estimate is $0.90 per share on revenue of $2.89 billion for the quarter ending September 30, 2021."
I quit selling on eBay over a year ago and I was a very active seller however it’s a lot of work and I am tired of giving them 10%So I quit.
"Do not look at the stock's price. Look at the company. If you believe in the company, then stay long, and do not pay attention to the price of stock. $PINS Pinterest, is a brand name. Like $FB $SNAP $EBAY $ETSY Pinterest, is a digital market place. It is a marketing billboard.I congecture there will be a lot of interested parties to marry Pinterest. ""If"" $Pypl, supposedly showed desire to explore. There will be more explorers. There was a time of SPACs. Now, the time of Mergers & Acquisitions. Even, IF Pins drops to below $40 That would be great. Smart money will start grabbing it like hungry Vultures, in African Savanas. If you are an investor, dollar cost average pins. If you are a bag holder. Do the same. Dollar cost average. Do not buy stock, As Buffet says, buy the company.Volatility is part of the investments. With great news and Positive ER, price will jump back to 60s in a matter of Days.Best regards to ALL"
Does it make sense to you that eBay is at all time highs? When was the peak of their business.. 2012? This may be a $30 stock within two years. Slow bleed.
ebay will crash AH on ER this afternoon
"Why is the Ebay leadership purposely destroying the company? I'm been selling on Ebay for 19 years. Here's what happened to me today. As a longtime seller, I've learned what sells and what doesn't. I just had a very high-demand item not get a single bid on an auction. Normally, it should have gotten at least 100 views from potential buyers. During the holiday season, 200 views would be normal. So many views did my ""popular"" item get? A grand total of five. Yes, just five! Hey Ebay -- tell me again why I should buy anything on your website when you're purposely sabotaging my business and livelihood?"
Anybody think Ebay will make an acquisition in the next several months? My opinion is that they will. Kind of getting dinosaur-ish.
Ebay joins the cancel culture. You can't sell out of print Dr. Seuss books. You can't make this stuff up.
