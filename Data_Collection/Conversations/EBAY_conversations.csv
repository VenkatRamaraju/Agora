"Sellers, we are being ripped off!When a buyer cancels an order, sellers are not refunded the entire eBay fee. And according to an EcommerceBytes reader, that's not the only cost.When a buyer places an order, sellers enrolled in eBay managed payments pay a Final Value Fee (commission plus payment-processing fees) to eBay along with a 30-cent per-transaction fee.When an order is cancelled, eBay returns the buyer's payment and credits the seller for fees, but keeps the 30-cent fee."
"Oh man, shorties got played big time!!"
"their sales going to tank 50%, sellers who used to have hundreds of items listed now have zero listed"
"They have been doing a Radio Shack for some time now. Radio Shack was unable to keep their unique niche business going so they decided to dive in with everyone selling cell phones, which was....everyone. Ebay's veritable war with small sellers pushes them into competing with the likes of AMZN, WMT, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC, ETC.............."
"Major lawsuit filed in federal court vs eBay for cyberstalking, check yahoo news lol"
"Yeah right. stock may be fine but I am boycotting this company until they resolve the ""shill bidding"". Look into it folks. It's real. If this goes unresolved then ebay does not care about it's clients."
"Love this stock. Already up 35% and expect it to grow to 90.00 soon.. with inflation, eBay is a value buy - and you can buy and sell new&used goods on here."
Shill bidding hahaha that has been happening since eBay opened in 1998. Corrupt to the core.
"I am a 24 year eBayer who is initiating a lawsuit. My account has been locked for no reason. Been going on for months. Can't be the only one. You lose a 24-year buyer who has spent in excess of .5M, your doors are closing. If there was any rationality to this market I would take a huge short position."
"Shorting here. I was a ebay powerseller for years then left as fees were to high. Tried to jump back (selling CGC graded coins), and I just can't do it. Sold 100 ounces of 2004 Silver Eagles in rolls and buyer complained that 2-3 had patina. I explained it was normal and e-bay just fully refunded them even with good pictures and description. Left me on the hook for shipping as well It took me weeks to get the final value fees back. This is just in the coin section, but the variety and sellers are really half of what it was just a few short years ago and like a quarter of what it was when I was a power seller. They are trying to go head to head with Walmart and Amazon, but what made them special is the unique items."
"Where does Ebay drop to? $65? $60? $50?I'm gonna say around November it'll be rolling around in the $40's, that's my guess.Have a great day, thanks!"
"this stock like csco orcl ibm, very solid results..."
Still tons of room to grow. Will hold for another 25% 
Does it make sense to you that eBay is at all time highs? When was the peak of their business.. 2012? This may be a $30 stock within two years. Slow bleed.
will be in mid 70's next week.
eBay $80 this week?
"Earnings out, and not nearly good enough to keep this Green tomorrow. This initial upside move we are seeing in the AH session will be swiftly followed by a major drop tomorrow. Happy to be Short a lot of shares at $68.01.Ebay (EBAY) reported 2nd Quarter June 2021 earnings of $0.99 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.99 per share on revenue of $3.0 billion. The company said it expects third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 to $0.96 per share on revenue of $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion, including Korea. The current consensus earnings estimate is $0.90 per share on revenue of $2.89 billion for the quarter ending September 30, 2021."
Ebay is OVER..23 years on ? former power seller... Now??? they want my Bank Routing number??? to a company??? impossible to get a hold of??? INSANE to give routing number...IMPORTANT...once some one has routing number!!! NO stop PAYMENT??? must close and open??? with NEW horrible fees?? returns??? you could BOUNCE checks at bank??? and now BANK fees...Guess i have sold LAST ebay item??? only thing keeping ebay is the COVID...forcing folks to sell for money??? not go to store???this will PASS as will EBAY...watch number of sellers DROP big time??? as insane to give EBAY bank Routing number
will be in 75 next week
eBay always goes down after earnings and moves back up. Just wait for earnings to be out before jumping in
Better than expected earnings
"This company is slowly bleeding. Sellers are fleeing to better platforms, buyers aren't on anymore. Too expensive."
This stock will tank buyers and sellers fed up with eBay 
"What is outlook for this company long term? Seems like they are losing sellers? And stimulus is ending soon? Plus, many more sellers (and sellers are buyers too) are planning to leave because of the 2022 new 1099 stuff, and there fees are getting more and more (many sellers make very little or nothing)"
One of my best performing stocks today. This company has been undervalued for a long time.
I will be looking to Cover my EBAY Short tomorrow at the $62 level during the regular session. Expecting a major sell-off right at market open as traders look to get out and Short interest increases.
"The only reason I invested is because I believe the drug works and I believe that HGEN has taken the right steps to get past the Regulatory Gatekeepers and to the sick that need it. That hasn't changed, except to say that the REG G's have taken a lot longer than I expected. When the stock goes down so much with so little volume, I take it as a comfort. I might be sick, but I was just in the same boat with $BMBL, $EBAY, and $LOW as well. If the stock was shooting sky high without the EUA, that's the time to be on guard.. $SESN is the ultimate example of that for generations of investors for all time.But when the SP is trickling down on low volume with virtually every analyst saying buy- I'll wait it out. I can but then again, I don't tend to invest in these out of the money options, WHICH by the way, is what I believe is the catalyst of today's SP, and probably tomorrow. If you're sitting on a Call with a Strike Price of 15, I think you're on the menu. Sorry about that..."
"I used to sell a lot on ebay, 1000's of items per year, but I stopped using ebay last year because their fees were just too high, plus they were deleting auctions based on violations of their policies that had nothing to do with the item I was selling. An example is a vintage emergency beacon from the 1950's, they cancelled the auction and gave a strike because they labeled the 1950's item as a ""restricted police item"". A 1950's old light lol. Anyways I have saved a fortune by leaving ebay and using other sites, and I still get the same buy price I expect too, but thankfully I don't have to pay the crazy ebay fees nor paypal fees. Old school tech companies totally out of touch and greedy, it'll be their end lol."
"Lots of analysts weighing in with mostly bullish opinions on the future of EBAY. But the most sensible one is right here:eBay (EBAY) PT Raised to $65 at Mizuho SecuritiesAugust 12, 2021 6:36 AM EDTMizuho Securities analyst James Lee raised the price target on eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) to $65.00 (from $63.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating.------------------------------That is his price target 12 months out, for August 2022, and it makes perfect sense. EBAY was overvalued prior to yesterday's earnings release, and is just as overvalued now, given yesterday's ER numbers. It should be trading today in the low $60's, at best, were it not for the Irrational Exuberance of the market as a whole."
Honestly better that Amazon has lower revs. Shows that competition is increasing and that $SHOP $EBAY and more are taking market share.
"So far in the pre-market session EBAY is acting very weak, but still holding up quite well. On very low volume, we have consistent bids in the mid-upper $66's. That is down quite a bit from yesterday's close, but does it accurately reflect the upcoming regular session action?? I do NOT think so. Serious traders wait for the regular session to begin. EBAY will see STRONG volume right at the open and for the first 20 minutes of the regular session. I predict a wave of sellers smothering this stock to the downside within 20 minutes of the open. We could go above $68 in the first 2 or 3 minutes, as wild swings are common as a stock opens immediately after earnings release. But it will not hold. A selling wave will take over, traders with profit looking to get out, traders with a loss fearful of a much bigger loss if they stay in, short sellers seeing a quick daytrading opportunity, etc... I expect this wave of selling pressure to take us down to the $65 level. And then for the rest of the day every upside pop from bargain hunters will be challenged by steady downside pressure, that is likely to gradually keep depressing the stock price down... I did just polish my crystal ball, so let us see how well it is working. My plan is to stay Short until later in the afternoon, though I did already Sell Short a few shares of DIS here in the pre-market, DIS will be my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, gonna throw all my hard capital Short on DIS before market close today. Good Luck! :-)"
"PWCC shill bidding destroys all reputations involved. The collectible business is based on trust. Not only does Ebay lose a huge client here, but the collectible world should get rocked here as well. Sell in the short term."
"eBay and Top Officials Named in Federal LawsuitAllegations of Systematic and Psychological Torture Aimed at SilencingJournalistsAttorney Rosemary Scapicchio, featured in the hit Netflix documentary ""Trial 4,"" representing PlaintiffsJuly 21, 2021 (Boston, MA): A federal lawsuit was filed this morning at the Moakley Courthouse in Boston, on behalf of David and Ina Steiner, Natick journalists behind the ecommerce trade publication, EcommerceBytes. The journalists accuse eBay, a multinational company with a market value of more than $47 billion, of engaging in a conspiracy to torture them both emotionally and psychologically. The suit also names eBay's former CEO, former Chief Communications Officer, and Progressive F.O.R.C.E Concepts.The suit alleges eBay engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate, threaten to kill, torture, terrorize, stalk and silence the Steiners through a barrage of around-the-clock cyberstalking, ominous death threats and deliveries, and in-person surveillance that caused the Steiners to fear for their lives.""The Plaintiffs are taking the brave step to hold all those responsible, accountable for these despicable acts."" said Rosemary Scapicchio, lawyer for the Plaintiffs.As a result of their conspiracy, two of the named Defendants have been indicted in the criminal proceeding; five of the named Defendants have pled guilty to their participation. The Defendants further obstructed investigations and concealed their actions from law enforcement to protect both themselves and their employers, which enabled the torture to continue.""This has been an unbelievably difficult ordeal for my wife and I,"" said David Steiner. ""Never did we imagine doing our jobs as journalists would lead to this. We want to protect the rights of reporters and their freedom of the press. We have endured enormous cruelty and abuse and feared for our lives. If this behavior can happen to us, it can happen to anyone.""The suit seeks damages to be awarded by a jury.The legal team consists of the Law Offices of Rosemary Scapicchio, the Law Office of Jillise McDonough, and the Law Offices of Laura Panos.Media Contact:Sean HennesseyThe Castle Group"
Love EBay. The stock has made me 24% ROI since April. Good luck shorts. EBay will continue to be a leader in the industry.
Major lawsuit filed in federal court vs eBay for cyberstalking. Google it
"Why would people use $wish platform, if they can buy, the same stuff on $EBAY ? And buy ebay stock. Ebay is established platform. You guys looking at the low price, not at the quality..."
paypal disaster will be reflected in the next quarter report - too early yet
Many sellers just are listing low end items for the most part. Never list an expensive item you would be willing lose. If you get scammed for a $25 item so be it. Don’t get hammered for a $200 item. eBay will most Always side with the buyer. Wait for the report this week. If they are up front with the true Sales numbers they will be lower
"btw most upper management is leaving fraudBay. Harry Temkin The buyer experience guru lasted only 1 year. The writing is on the wall. More scandals, more fraud, worse buyer and seller experience, higher fees, less support, MORE LIES from Iannone, and a stock that frauds investors daily."

I'm planning to hold this for 20+ years. Hoping for $1000 someday.
YTD 34% and dividend.
is ebay going to be investigated along with PWCC? didn't they have some type of partnership? not good imho
"Gonna be selling short a lot of shares of EBAY just before market close today. This is a very specific earnings play. I am confident that with the lock-downs lifted in recent months, people will be spending more money on in-person shopping, and less on an internet-exclusive platform like Ebay. The earnings numbers coming out in a few minutes should be weaker than expected, and with the future looking very uncertain, EBAY should sell off significantly in direct response to this ER. Good Luck!"
"Yes, please continue to short eBay shares until you exhausted, but eBay management will back up their truck on buybacks with their billions of share repurchase authorized last quarter."
"If you need me to inform you of any other fraudulent companies, You can find me on the $GM and $salesforce forum."
somebody tell me just ONE TIME eBay held a 6% gain on the day. I'll wait
eBay… No longer owns PayPal since its spin-off years ago.
"So consumer sentiment is down, yet this is up and other retail stocks are down. I don't get it"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Too many shorties here... its smells...
Who let the bears out?
"A sincere question. This company sells things they do not buy, produce, store or transport: how is it they do not make more money than they do? Is the organization bloated?"
"Sara, is eBay $20 yet?"
I used sell on Ebay. It's no longer an auction site. Any person can complain for any reason and then the seller gets stuck. Fees take a big chunk of your money. I just cant sell on Ebay anymore. It was good once but Amazon eating their lunch
Ebay next earnings will be strong. They are not having the supply chain issues like amazon. I own the stock and will buy the dip for a long term hold.
If the P/E ratio is correct this is going to $100 next week.In fact $200 would be a better estimate.
eBay probably buried itself with the recent move to stop using PayPal and move to Pioneer instead...
"-no healthy upstream* glitches- ripping customers and sellers off left and right￼-Banning people for trying to sell stuff that they bought already off eBay.￼￼The list goes on and on, this stock and many others right now prove that the stock market has nothing to do with the actual business. This business is terrible! It has been losing customers and buyers daily for years. ￼￼"
