"why are you all wasting your breath on a robo-generated ""article"" from Zacks? Generated by a program that just spits out numbers from a spreadsheet on stale analyst numbers. testing is here to stay and grow"
"I am new to the QDEL family but I couldn't resist, scooped up a bunch of shares and sold a couple puts. Very good value play here, 6 PE! you joking... plus they started buying back shares last quarter even though last quarter was a down quarter hmmm... They have known for a while there best quarters are ahead of them. (3rd and 4th) I wouldn't be surprised if they report far better than their preliminary report north of 500 million, also very curious how this webinar goes tomorrow, I love the stock at this level, I have a hard time seeing this stock dropping over the next couple week, but you never know. Do your own research don't just take my word for it"
White House to make additional $1B investment in COVID-19 at-home tests
Quidel preannounces and as expected beats all expectations by a wide margin
"Anyone spotted that Qured is using Quickvue for its testing option on American Airlines? Looks like it's significantly more cost effective than the competition. UK is now allowing the more cost effective antigen testing for International arrivals. More $ for Quidel. Selfishly I'd love the price action to stay low into next year, it's like picking money off the floor at these levels."
"ABT blew away eps Q3 estimates, earning $1.40 per share based largely on covid test sales. Company has added approx. $6 billion to market cap today. That figure is in excess of the entire QDEL cap. Big move coming with earnings release, IMO."
"Quidel’s stock price is down 50% for the last 12 months, this is while the company has increased capacity and profits by 10x. Given the various sizeable Government contracts, school and employer testing, further increases in products, capacity and profits are inevitable, all resulting in further downward pressure on the stock."
"Was just in my local Walgreens to use my coupons. At the check out counter the Abbot display had QuickVue kits with only 4 left. At least in Texas QDEL is winning the distribution battle. Note dramatic eps est increases posted today. CASH, CASH, CASH on the way."
Once again DJ and Rick are correct about this stock--going nowhere as many stocks claw to all time highs--what's next for QDEL---nothing- ness til next week DB laughing at Flixy et al here as he holds back til he's gets his price As for the Mcnuggets--I own 2 McDonalds franchises already--lol
By the way. Short interest down from 11% to 8%. DJ did you cover your 1.2 million shares?
Blows away estimates or just blows . Down 2.22 on great news????
Why is it down?--nobody wants to buy except me accumulating shares that many are capitulating after all this good news about testing etc--- not that I love this co and it's CEO--but I know the manipulation going on---still long -my puts (hedges) are making money as I slowly accumulate around 130--if it drops much more then I am wrong if it rallies I am right and I will short the rip--that simple--Flixy try to read it slow or write it on your arm
"What would be the opposite of pump and dump, deflate and accumulate?"
DGX reported eps of $4.02 vs $2.88 expected and raised full year guidance. They did this without a home testing product. Stock up approx. 3% pre market. One more indication of good things to come.
"Unbelievable garbage from Zacks: On Oct. 7, Quidel announced that, for the period ending Sept. 30, its revenue will come in between $505 million and $510 million. At the top end of that estimate, it would be a 7% increase from the $476 million it reported in Q3 last yearZacks article says it will be 344M. Should be ashamed of themselves for lying in the open."
Setting up for a huge pop on earnings release
"Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces Additional Actions to Increase COVID-19 Screening Testing in Schools and Keep Students SafeOctober 29, 2021https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-additional-actions-to-increase-covid-19-screening-testing-in-schools-and-keep-students-safe/""As part of President Biden’s COVID-19 Action Plan announced in September, the Administration called on all schools to set up regular testing in schools for students, teachers, and staff consistent with CDC guidance. The Administration provided $10 billion in funding for COVID-19 screening testing for teachers, staff, and students in K-12 schools, in addition to the $130 billion provided to states and school districts that may also be used for testing. Screening testing is a critical strategy to identify positive cases of COVID-19 in students and staff and ensure K-12 schools can operate safely during the COVID-19 pandemic."""
"Opening a fund to support meds for Joker/Drick. Anyone else wants in? He/they are too precious for this board for our daily dose of laughter. Given how far they are gone, it will be expensive supporting their meds and hence this gofundme campaign. Lets make Dj and Drick one again "
"This is another one of my ""buy every dip"" stocks.In fact it's the biggest holding in my entire portfolio right now, side by side only with PBT in position size.My price target is $200 by 2022.Seem hard to believe? Christmas is comin boys. Santa is on his way. Hang your stockings and relax."
"QDEL will likely be acquired by a larger diagnostics manufacturer now that it is generating billions in revenue with essentially no debt. Long term shareholders have huge paper profits if you look at the five year chart. The majority of shareholders are long term. BDX DHR TMO or ABT would be likely acquirers if they are interested in a profitable bolt on acquisition at a discounted price. Insiders and long term shareholders likely tired of being beaten up by hedge funds shorting the stock likely ready to sell at the right price. Contrary to bears hypothesis that the company is overvalued from temporary windfall from Covid tests, the reality is that the company’s recent growth is likely going to be sustained thanks to the 60% increase in long term contracts signed in the professional segment and the new and rapidly growing market in the at home testing market which will expand beyond Covid testing to influenza and other pathogens. Savanna will add significant growth in the molecular testing market. International distribution of the company ‘s tests is being increased to be able to monetize it’s expanded production capacity which thanks to Covid testing revenue., is paid for and will be at full capacity in just two months. The stock is so unappreciated by the Street relying on analysts not seeing the company’s potential in the medium and longer term. The uncertainty of when a larger company will make an offer makes shorting this stock high risk. I expect a 40-50% premium at current prices and am adding to my position if the stock drops any further."
