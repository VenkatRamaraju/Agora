"While the last few days has been fun based on QuickVue prospects, perhaps it is time to remember what will provide a higher base level of sales. I refer to the enhanced cooperation with Cardinal Health(CAH). This emphasis provides boots on the ground every day promoting the use of on site machine testing capability. To mix metaphors, blocking and tackling are the keys to long run success for any football team."
bought again at 145 area
Qdel can't hold a gain-short the pops til news comes out--sorry Flix back to the bowl lad!
Where's Anonymous these days? Awfully quite.
Looking for a little backtesting here --a bit overbought-Flix-take note-I know you mean well NOT
"Dj net short now? Also, did you take your meds?"
Got to good some more news within next 2 days or an upgrade or will drift back down below 140--just a warning!
"Good news-markets will turn up soon bringing QDEL with it--speculation will return and bagholders will finally break even--(good news for Flix)--I will continue to trade back and forth-may even let you know when to go ""all in"""
The regular response: shorts is being made. but... don't you dare to sale at this level!!!. the stock will eventually climb at list to 180 in the few weeks to come.
QDEL is dead money.
close enough-- sold my puts----not going long yet---just holding some core positions--don't trust it---DB and insiders waiting for lower to buy---oh the crooks! Flix now on meds!
Ok--as expected the slow but steady decline continues until they release a new contract-then a blip and short some more--Netflix-will keep pumping until its back below 120 where it's Timberrrr time again! This Flix dude still pumps stox like Baba--verry similar stoc-great potential but ....
Did Delusional joker just go full long? His channel broke lol
"Company needs to promote sale of home OTC testing in the face of rising delta plus infection in both unvaccinated and vaccinated people. The fact vaccinated people can be infected and transmit infection while being asymptomatic puts vulnerable people at risk and is responsible for rising number of cases and hostpilizations. Weekly testing with OTC tests has proven reductions in community spread as already demonstrated in North Carolina and Tennessee trials and ongoing trial in Deleware all using serial testing using Quidel's rapid antigen tests weekly. These results need to be promoted in media and Quidel might hire credible pulic health experts to be media spokesman, like Dr. Michael Mina out of Harvard who has publicly commented for the past year about the need to do serial rapid anitgen tests like those made by Quidel to allow timely early quarantine of infected individuals to prevent spread of outbreaks of Covid variantsin the local community and allow earlier treatment if needed."
"Guys, delusional joker flipped to bet short"
Delusional joker: net long and bought the $80 area in pre market 
CVS news is huge for next 3-4 qtrs revenue
"Just went on Walgreens web site to check availability of QuickVue kits. SOLD OUT!! Still available on Amazon, but I bet not for long. Can't tell whether it can be ordered at CVS yet. Remember the company in the spring announced big test capacity increase to come online inQ3(?). If any analyst is paying attention, eps est increase coming shortly. Net-net, with stock buyback in place, downside is $103.00(yearly low) and upside at least back to $150.00(recent high). So $15 down risk and $30 upside=2X1 risk reward from here, IMHO."
One thing i like about Doug Bryant is that he tells the truth. Covid is not predictable at all. I'm sick of CEOs hyping up their companies when they don't even have a product yet and the stock zooms 200%.
Never trust analyst action in the “dark period” before earnings—always an agenda. This should print tomorrow.
Someone knows something. Huge order
"Loaded up on this dip.Back to where we started before the run, but not quite, which is the way they like to play it. Just enough to make the over-leveraged and those who got to big in their position freak out and sell.Anything under 125 is bargain basement territory, that's where I did my buying. Anything under 120 is what I would call the FREE MONEY ZONE. Highly doubt we'll break and stay under 120, but if we do, that's when I bring out the big guns. I'm gonna need a much bigger buy button at those prices, boys!!Hope y'all loaded up like there was no tomorrow, today!"
Ok--we have 40 minutes left -the crooks have not run it up-so my analysis using proprietary indicators determines--earnings come out slightly better than expected--she drops about 15 points bounces back and forth --then CEO Mr unknown says the return of covid is looking good for us but we are not sure--we will know more in a few months---Timberrrrrr!
155 on the announcement back down to 140 soon---
"Stock market terrors combined have caused pull backs everywhere. I suspected QDELs stock price might suffer even though they will be profiting for quite some time with the test kits. I sold my stake in anticipation and was lucky to dodge this bullet. I'm tempted to buy back, but I am concerned that we're about to see a larger pullback in the stock market in general and even good stocks will suffer."
"This is HUGE!! Demand is there based on anecdotal comments. 600 mm tests X $10.00=$6 b capacity. Sales last year were $1.66 b, so we could potentially see a multiple of that ultimately. I revise my earlier price objective of $150.00 to $200.00 when Q3 numbers reported and strong forecast given for Q4"
Shorts should get a memo to cover since it's seems like the only way from here is up
"200$ by end of q4, no sweat"
Topped up. Great company with a strong Balance Sheet and products in demand.Think it is being manipulated down on low volume by those who pay down rampers to post here.
Some numbers indicate just under 15% short.That mad scramble will be fun to watch!
"Will sell again at 140--maybe keep half in case we get an upgrade You too can be a member of ""Crystal Ball Investing""--just folloe DJ--Flixy you are banned to a life of Lepercy!"
QDEL getting tired near 130--possible pullback to scare out some longs---need positive guidance to keep Flix et al from gettin skulled some more!
Will go long if it successfully tests 135 today
Didnt get the news release my insider talked about! Hmmm keep an eye out--meanwhile play the bounces tween 130 to 140
"Long article in the New York Times today about Abbott Labs having shredded many tests, having laid off employees and now being unable to address surging test demand and retailers being sold out."
"Do I hear 145?--thats from 160 Flix--15 points because of what?--bad market--no-----bad PR , no guidance!"
"Quick note folks. I am a QDEL long. Today's drop. Street says triggered by Abbot's weak guidance. Affected the entire health care market. You can see LABD rose today. QDEL already received it's haircut on unclear demand for covid testing. Many times. ABT - this was the first time it dropped this big in a while. Tuesday (tomorrow) QDEL presents at William Blair Growth Stock Conference (10:40 AM). Don't know if Q&A follows, but they should be prepared to answer question on covid testing outlook and comments on ABT results. If they answer this way, they are inviting the stock to tank. Yet again. ""Gee - I dunno what the market for covid testing will look like. And even the mighty Abbot Labs is unable to forecast well. So we'll see and do our best"".If they answer this way - stock will stay firm and resume it's upward trajectory:""QDEL is prepared to provide customers with easy to use, at-home covid testing kits even if the demand surges to 2020 levels and beyond. Our supply chain is operational. Covid testing is part of our broad portfolio of diagnostic testing products and we are poised to lead this market. Diagnostic need continues to rise. We respect our competitors like ABT, but our focus remains on building the best testing products for our customers""Of course, (lottery) if they report 1 Million 2-packs flew off Amazon shelves in the first week - the stock will double within minutes!!! ( I bought twice and have used one of 4 tests. Really easy to use)Long term I'm holding."

Nutflix--how does it feel to get all elated that you are getting close to break-even--big rally-then have it taken away by the shorts?---gotta be a trader lad!
it is a normal retracement and it's just about done. $5 more down is possible not probable Next move to $175. ABC UP. So far I was right 100%. let see...
"Many would say--""this DJ is a little crazy""--he calls all the ups and downs--many cant stay with him--they call him quickdraw--but if you can- you will bank some $$$$ I think Ive called every 5 to 10 point move in the last 30 days except for the 15 point headfake--but I shorted it quick- timestamped my friends Flixy--your slowly coming over to the ""dark side"""
"Dont panic, everyone. This current Covid spike didnt start until Q3 started. Q2 earnings were expected to be low, because cases had dropped so much in the spring. Now back on the rise worldwide with Delta variant, Q3 looks to be a monster quarter! Just be patient and buy more if it dips again"
Today a NYT article quotes major academic public health professionals discussing the underutilization of rapid antigen Covid tests in the US and the need for widespread expansion of there use like in Europe where the pandemic is under better control allowing early quarantine of transmissible infected patients and allowing everyone else to go to work or school with less risk. Perhaps QDEL stock price is responding to this article as Quidel is expanding it’s production capacity to 70 million tests a month to help meet demand.
Mr hair cut how are you today? Time to cover hahah
Relative Strength-not here---need a press release or 130 is possible--sad but true--Flix and his minions--Mylanta works
"Guys, if Dj posts, just ignore him, he might not have taken his meds"
"Good news guys, the delusional joker is long again. Now I feel better. We are holding bags since early 100s and now they will be worth something. All hail the joker :)"
Let's get something straight kids---I called every down and up move in this stock and helped get her moving by calling out the CEO on a conference call---if he did not write the review it would still be between 120-135 Don't let ridiculus and Flixurnose foo lyou -they are bagholders climbing back to their price at 180

Quidel preannounces and as expected beats all expectations by a wide margin
"MHOQuidel and Sorrento, both companies are going to pay back from current levels, it just takes patience."
I wonder if the test not being available is a negative. Did they pull it out for some reason? They should not be running out everywhere?
Just a trading range til earnings--a news release comes a rally--sell into it--a dip around 130 buy it--not even worth messing with it now unless you are nimble like DJ--will tell you how to play it when Nov comes--right now just banter noise and hate from the woke crowd--Flix and -No common sense etal
Was the settlement not a good deal for both parties. QDEL will receive $75M a year thru 2029! A good influx of cash to support payments toward an upcoming acquisition. - not sure why stock down — insight anyone?
"I wonder what would happen if the millennial ""investors"" that run after semi-bk companies with mountains of debt and zero earnings just because they see an opportunity for a short squeeze ever stumble across a company that has no debt, makes hundreds of millions in profit and has 15% of its shares short???That would be a fun day, imo.but then again, those ""investors"" are not using logic, so, the above will likely never happen. Just a nice thought though, imo."
keep buyin boys!short squeeze hasn't even STARTED.Destination: MOON
"Quidel Corporation's (NASDAQ:QDEL) development of an antigen test for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a ""game changer"" in the world's fight against the pandemic, former Food and Drugs Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CBS on Sunday.The test was given emergency use authorization by the FDA late Friday.'Quick And Cost Effective'""I think this kind of technology is a real game changer...it's a very rapid test that could be used in a doctor's office,"" Gottlieb said at CBS ""Face The Nation.""""Doctors now have about 40,000 of these Sofia machines already installed in their offices. And you do a simple nasal swab and the test itself scans for the antigens that the virus produces.""Gottlieb noted the test is cost-effective and quick to return results. ""It'll probably be about five dollars a test and you can get a result within five minutes,"" he told CBS.According to the former FDA chairman, the test gives accurate results about 85% of the time. Those who don't return coronavirus positive from the test can then see an additional screening through PCR-based tests, which take up to 24 hours to give the results.""For those [85%] patients that you could screen out right away, you're getting a very fast result and you can start to take action immediately,"" he said at the CBS show."
"Lol, really beed to use mute now. Desperate shortie (anonymous) on the lose."
OK kids and non gender Flix:--you got the pop I was talkin about-- ride it to high 120's - get your hedge put in place--don't get too happy but this is the move i was hoping for before I short more--who's your Daddy Flix?

"Tomorrow's earnings report for 2nd qtr and investor call after the close will likely be easy to beat street estimates that have been dramatically lowered by analysts over the past 90 days. If guidance during the call suggests improving sales in the second half and confirms Savanna on track for approval by year end analysts are likely to raise estimates and a significant short squeeze likely to result with 17% of the float currently shorted. With delta variant surge, it's no surprise to me stock is moving up ahead of earnings."
whoa some news comin---tighten up here!
Analysts should be scrambling to raise their price targets now. Fantastic news!!
I'll cover at 135-136 and go long if I see some volume Flixy you just go back to watching the View
QDEL used over $400million during 2nd quarter. 100m repurchase stocks. where did qdel spend over 400mil on?
OK-the cheap seats are bustin on me--can't follow my complex trades---here we go--holding core shares from 130--was short since friday-read my posts--sold puts went long at 140--small tranche--dont trust this yet til some good news come out from chicken nexk DB--he is killin you perma bulls--what a tease!
Flixy gettting tingly as QDEL explodes up 2 points-LOL--little Deadcat action here
"Looking forward to some updates on manufacturing next week on earnings call. Quidel stated last year that their new manufacturing facility in Carlsbad would produce 600 million Quickvue tests per year by EOY 2021. In addition to the Quickvue tests, they plan to ramp up their Sofia cartridges to around 240 million or so. This is a minimum of 10x ramp up in total production from pre-covid days. Earlier in the year they mentioned they were significantly ahead of schedule for manufacturing, hope we get some more details on this next week.We know that Quickvue at-home is being sold in multiple countries, it's been the number one seller on Amazon for 2 months solid. In the last few days their main distribution partner Simply Medical has been intermittently out of stock, which affects both Walmart and Amazon supply as Simply Medical is the central distribution. There could be many reasons for being out of stock, but I'm sure they are doing well with sales.We also know they had a standing order for 50 million Quickvue At-home tests, and that was just one order.We know they have at least one Airline deal, we know that they have bagged one State for School testing. We know they have at least one large financial firm testing employees. We know they have a ground breaking new product approved in Europe and awaiting USA approval. The list goes on..."
It's obvious now that Bryant has been reading my posts on various social media -criticizing him for not issuing news or guidance--this goes against his grain- but he knows I have been hinting to his board that he is the reason the stock is down---
"Quidel website now states that QuickVue at-home 10 minute Covid-19 test will be ""available soon"". This is after 15 days of Emergency Use Approval.Company expects to produce 50 million tests each month by Dec 2021.There is one competitor Abbot - making BinaxNOW at 50M per month. The hidden opportunity in QDEL stock is - many are zeroed in on covid testing revenue as make or break. Fundamentally, it is a premier medical testing company. It should be trading $140-$175 without any covid expectations. Discount is due to myopic view hinged on covid testing. Continued need for Covid testing is a likely scenario. In that case QDEL will zoom past $200 and never look back."

their business model is unsustainable
"Back above the 50 day moving average. Very bullish and should attract some buyers, who sold earlier. Way to go Qudel. Out of intensive care and into recovery."
Looks scary. Down on volume. Time to buy. DJ comment please. Make me laugh.
"Sometimes you win sometimes you lose. I did not expect today's move lower. I will continue to average down and hold longer term.QDEL will likely make 1.5bn in cash this year to add to their 0.7bn cash balance. With a market cap of less than 8bn this makes QDEL a cash generating machine to either buy others to diversify or become an attractive buyout target.Aiming for capacity to produce 700mn tests with very healthy margins is something special. I can imagine employers sending kits to test before you go into work. A repeatable many times a month need unlike a vaccine.Those that really believe this virus will just wither away are being too optimistic. Viruses mutate, and this one is showing a nasty habit to do so. Vaccines will always play catch up and there is no proof that being vaccinated fully prevents you from spreading the disease. Yes severe cases will drop off but COVID will be more like the flu longer term.My investment thesis is that every year there will be multiple COVID strains spreading and you will need a multi-variant shot (only recombinant adjuvant protein vaccines like Novavax can address a multi strain shot, MRNA vaccines are too toxic to handle multiple variants). Testing will be a common thing, telemedicine with homekits as the corner stone is the future. BUT competition will increase dropping prices to a few $, so investing in capacity early and getting an install base out in the world is the right strategy.I am 100% behind QDEL and a few missteps along the journey is normal"
Local CVS by my home sold out of Quickvue Covid kits the first day it arrived this week. Restocking this weekend. Very high demand obvious. It will be a blowout third quarter.
Already up 8 points from shorts--may ride back up to 140 soon--Flixy you watch and learn
"Ba de, that's a wrap. Christmas early. I love it!"
"What a nice reversal for QDEL shareholders in the last few days. Starting to fill the gap primarily due to expected increase in testing expected in the workplace schools and at home with increased use of OTC tests expected with the spread of delta variant worldwide. Also IMO, a special situation is likely developing for QDEL with the expected FDA approval of it's Savanna platform. This will be a game changer in molecular testing making it affordable for the thousands of hospitals and clinics that send out molecular tests to reference labs like Quest and Lab Corp to be able to instead perform these tests on site at a small fraction of the current cost with a single specimen, and be able to test qualitatively or quantitatively with molecular accuracy for up to 12 diseases presenting with similar symptoms in under 30 minutes. CE mark in EU just granted for QDEL's respiratory panel on this platform, testing for Covid influenza A and B and RSV. If buyout rumors are true, Quest would make sense as a larger company interested in acquiring QDEL since it's reference lab business would lose a lot of tests when Savanna is purchased by it's customers and these tests are run in house instead of being sent to Quest. Also it would give Quest entry into the OTC rapid immuno-assay business with QDEL's expanded capacity to make 50 million Quickvue rapid tests a month by year end. I believe when the demand for OTC testing reaches the QDEL's maximum capacity for production, it would make it's share value at least $300/share. That kind of demand may come quickly this coming fall/winter with flu season and spread of covid variants likely to coincide with society reopening for business world wide."
13% of the float was shortThats potentially millions of shares about to be purchased as the short squeeze begins in earnest
As you see QDEL is petering out here--no news is bad news for this stock--as warned get some puts as protection here
"Looks like CEO just acquired 11,140 options with a strike price of $142.45. Adding to his pile of 495,000 shares."
Last month institutional holding up by 6% short interest down by 4% . Going in the right direction. I now nothing about SRNE only can see they loosing $1.17 per share. Good luck speculating. We are investing .
Can someone help with the mathematics of the below:Held by institutionals 93%Held by insiders 12%Short as a % of outstanding shares 13%...Some folks are sitting on a barrel of powder :)
"The last quarter had millions in expenses, that will not be present this quarter. They are rolling in the cash this quater."
"Stay safe y'all. My worst fears have come true. Covid has resurged in the United States. Actual damage will be seen in a couple of weeks (hospitalizations, deaths). Masks on (no matter what your state government tells you) and get that vaccine if you have been holding off. It certainly helps reduce the chances and severity."
Not impressed by the decline. Feels good being a long term investor looking to regularly increase his position.
why the sell off today and late last week? anyone explain this?
"“Our updated guidance recommends vaccinated people get tested upon exposure regardless of symptoms,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, told The New York Times in an email."
Close above $130??
Telehealth and home testing is the future for Quidel...
"Quidel’s stock price is down 50% for the last 12 months, this is while the company has increased capacity and profits by 10x. Given the various sizeable Government contracts, school and employer testing, further increases in products, capacity and profits are inevitable, all resulting in further downward pressure on the stock."
"After being at the number one spot on Amazon for months, Quickvue At-home is currently unavailable. It's also out of stock at Walmart and Simply Medical. Maybe the USA is going the route that the UK did on testing. If this is the case it's a win/win, stock will explode but more importantly we get this virus under control."
This fantastic buy has a P/E under 7 and products that will remain in demand for years.
"Toast to all longs!!!Glad I added at $120s recently and had powder for $110 and my absolute bottom $103 (scenario with 0 covid revenue)I had also bought Jan'21 $200 calls at $1.5 each and looking at them with my mouth wide open in disbelief. We have no control over the wild swings. But I can be patient during smash downs and of course enjoy/profit on spikes. Because ....QDEL, a company that started in 1979 as a medical/health diagnostic company has now blossomed into worlds premier and state of the art Diagnostic Company, having learned quickly how to ""scale"" and yet advance testing technology and convenience, at ""fundamental"" levels. Not without bumps on the road - but it's marching forward. Savannah alone can take it to $200 and then continue the rise. More innovations to come. Cash position is not strong. It's very strong. Unheard of, Strong!!! (in bio tech)To me, it's incidental that covid unfortunately is not gone yet, or if there isn't or is another company wanting all of QDEL. Wrongly - Wall St tends to get fixated on these and makes random moves UP or DOWN without regard to fundamentals.Investors can also get carried away. Company can also get swayed in making wrong decisions. When fundamentals are right - QDEL, the company should stay focused and stock holders should stay patient. Let us collectively (Company and its shareholders) sway Wall St, vs the other way around)"
Any guesses for the bottom price?
"I was so close to sell today @150, but changed my mind thinking it is going to mid $160. Oh well, as of now I'm a long term investor. Hopefully, 200's is coming soon."
Hmmmm gettin close to 140-my fave shorting area--take it down DB
TMO ups forward guidance based off increased Covid testing. QDEL moving up in tandem! Dj magically is long again. Lmao
I see no reason to complain about the stock price just an opportunity to grow my position https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/11/california-increased-covid-testing-demand-cases-surge
#1 Best Seller in Industrial and Scientific category on Amazon today. Toilet paper and masks are in that category. Abbott is number 16 and is temporarily out of stock.
"When Q3 earnings are out they should be much, much better. Remember, this is the testing company that has gone nowhere in the middle of a pandemic. The Company should also provide spectacular guidance for the 4th quarter and beyond including long overdue specifics of new production. Absent that it's a sell for me."
How does Bidens announcement affect QDEL?
Excellent haircut day! Down over 1%+ and picking up steam….
"@NFLXBull ForeverI absolutely agree with you DJ is a joke. But price of a stock not only about PR. It can be manipulated by PR for a short period of time. At the end of the day it's all about the profit and QDEL is going to be huge. if they sell 70 mil. test a month it will increase company revenue at list x 8 times and profit even more than 8 times. I don't want to predict the price, but it's going UP."
Not showing the relative strength I would like to see here---let's see what happens at final hour --if it sells off more get short!
"With Abbott coming up short on kits, Qdel will have fantastic quarter. Like I predicated we may even run out ourselves. We should hit 140 easy soon. Go Longs!"
This may not get going til after earnings DB will blow it after report too!
"If real world experience matters, I had bought a few QuickVue tests from Walmart last month. They worked so well that I ordered a few more after looking through Amazon and also Simply Medical. Jump to yesterday where my sister wanted a couple, and everywhere I looked was sold out. Walmart, Amazon, and Simply Medical all sold out - and this was for single packs (containing two tests) as well as the 45 box kits. As a newcomer to QDEL, is $134 a nice starting point? I am looking at this company as a positive, so if you think it's going to zero, that's great...but for those that are slightly bullish, where is a good entry? The 20 day is sitting at $135, and the 50 is at $124...$134 seems more than fair considering they are selling the heck out of the QuickVue at the moment. Compared to other 10 minute covid tests that I have tried, Quidel's is far superior. Has to be best in class, yeah? A quick read of earnings shows no huge red flags, and I just read that schools in Delaware have chosen to use QuickVue for testing."
"None of this makes any sense but then again the market is often divorced from reality. Testing will be a key part of any strategy to get life back to ""normal."" And as many others have pointed out, QDEL is not just a COVID testing company. All of their revenue streams are in fact growing. There are considerable risks with the vaccines as well. Some need to be stored at -80 degrees, we know that most people will not have access to a vaccine until late 2021 at best. I'm holding my position at $213/share. I've already missed on selling off, but am not too worried at this point."
OK this played out as I have posted--still long here as its getting upgrades--hedging with small puts but still long--let's see--Flix--watch and learn!
First tranche
Not even sure what to think here. It seems to be defying all logic with this continued downward movement. Buying a little more each day though.
a lot of buyers following my channel here big orders near 141--should take it a little higher nothing above 145 without breaking news!
"Remains my largest, highest conviction holding!Should never gone below 300, and will get back the much sooner than anyone thinks, leaving a trail of slaughtered short sellers in its wake!"
Buy the dip
Cases are now back to pre-vaccination levels.. https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/us-covid-19-cases-back-pre-vaccination-levels
up 52 cents--Flix and Ridiculus buying down from 180
Mr haircut.. prepare to cover
This company just said they will be able to produce like 50 million test kits a month. Up from 50 million a week! UHHHH this stock hits 300 imho within 6 months
Volumes is picking up. This is DJ buying. He is getting long.
Wow! Almost 6% down at opening.
Buyers coming in as realization testing will be needed to get treatment as well as monitor for outbreaks of variants in both vaccinated and unvaccinated
How high do we fly?
Good news baggers--(flix etc)--140 held--goin long a little here
OK--playing out as I predicted--finally some good news to temporarily prop it up to next fib area at 150---what's it gonna take for 180?--prolly have to wait for earnings predictions or upgrades--DB needs 145 on his latest big purchases--lets hear a buy back? Nut flix--I told you to buy not sell!
Testing will skytocket (it actually started already). Covid testing is a nice addition to an already appealing business. Look at John hopkins daily testing count. See a pattern ? https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states
DB as I refer to him as-wants more buybacks at 130--so I'm adjusting accordingly--not selling shares but net short again--FLIX-keep buying down son!
"Hello Mr Haircut, where are you? We miss you"
"Markets at all time highs, 3x normal volume, excellent downward price action! Qdel never fails to impress! Institutional funds are off loading qdel. Look for below 90 by Labor Day."
Where does it go today---attempt 140 if the stock market rallies which looks probable into PM--there I will probably short it--lookin for 4 to 5 points--Flixy--shut up
Not impressed with it here but it held 135--still not convinced --waiting
WHY?--when every one knows this will be a decent quarter for QDEL is this stock not popping?--Answer for Flix et al--the people in the know (me)-realize that covid will be another flew bug thing in a year and QDEL will be giving away test kits for free--nice write off. The price will drop from 130's to 100--prepare for this
Missed that short by 30 cents yesterday at 158--woulda gor 3 or 4 quick points -but can't win em all-just most Hang in there folks I will let you know my next swing--not all the scalps--people pay me for those--see FLIX
Who all thinks delusional joker is likely to flip to net long today 
"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced today a large-scale buy of diagnostic instruments and COVID-19 tests that it will distribute to the nation's 15,400 nursing homes in coming months. The agency will begin to distribute the equipment and tests next week to 2,000 nursing homes ranked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for being at highest risk for community spread of COVID-19.The test instruments that HHS is distributing are the Sofia 2 from Quidel (NASDAQ:QDEL) and BD Veritor Plus from Becton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX). The instruments use immunoassay tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in samples from nasal swabs in 15 minutes. Both systems have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.HHS plans to ship the units and about 400 tests to every nursing home in the country. After that, facilities can order additional tests for under $25 each. The government says that each nursing home needs the capability to screen residents and to test staff at least weekly. By September, HHS hopes to have 15 million to 20 million tests available each month, but the companies will likely not have the production capacity to meet the full demand for the tests and supplies until OctoberThe guidance from the company during it's 2nd quarter conference call on July 30 will suggest during the current 3rd quarter, quidel is rapidly ramping up production and sales of Sofia 2 readers, and it's rapid covid antingen tests for use in all the skilled nursing homes in the US who will be testing residents weekly. I expect similar opportunity in schools from elementary through university and in essential businesses including food processing plants, utility plants, government first responders (the military, police fire/paramedics/defense contractors). Likely to get expanded use in in walk in clinics and pharmacies and large private companies to regularly screen employees as Quidel's production capacity increases."
Unreal.
"Any one heard from the company when or whether they will formally announce government $700 mm+ contract? News is out, but only if you look for it. Please help."
Investors continue buying the dipsTrending back up and the real move up will be driven by 3rd quarter earnings and analysts raising price targets based on expected rising sales from increased production capacity being matched by worldwide demand for cost effective Testing for Covid
Going back to $150.00 recent high just on renewed interest from delta testing. Look for eps est upward revisions shortly and great Q3 earnings with strong Q4 guidance.
Articles today describing over the counter Covid testing selling out in pharmacies across the country. Qdel sales should be through the roof this quarter. Looking forward to coming short squeeze. Increased production capacity appears to be coinciding with uptick in demand. I bought two test kits today and staff at pharmacy report they are selling very well and suppliers keeping up with demand. Looking forward to third quarter earnings.
May the squeeze start in earnest next week!!!
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
@DJ. First it was 125 than 130 now 135 what next to feel like clairvoyant?
Flix -down we go bagholder -my puts are racking up the big $$$$-yes I was long a bit but Im bearish and its goin lower til CEo puts out a guidance higher which isnt coming---Maybe you should get another security guard position nights at The library
"Quidel plans to install multiple manufacturing lines at the Carlsbad facility and hire approximately 400 new employees with a mission to scale Quidel’s operations from 50 million QuickVue tests per year to 50 million tests per month at full capacity, including non-COVID-19 diagnostic assays currently in-market or under development. The company is actively hiring to fill open positions including engineers, chemists, technicians, manufacturing, purchasing, sourcing and support services."
"I can see why David Jagleski only has 500 followers. He really missed Savanna, didn't even mention it. He also forgot that covid is never going away, it's world wide and mutates every 5 months. Like the flu it's here for good. I really dislike bashers who are naive to reality."
Down we go-can't hold a gain!!!!
"Still no government contract formal announcement. What have they got, writer's block?"
The US just performed the highest number of tests since the pandemic began. The avearges are still of last winter but not that far (+this is not factoring OTC tests)..https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states
Earnings are temporary result of a company (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4).... INFECTIOUS DIEASES are a Long Term problem for the world but a Long Term business for the company... Testing & vaccination will always be required.. Till Covid-19 is declared a threat no more to humans..... you should invest more for your future.
"Hi Gang. Quick question, why haven't analyst earnings estimates been revised upward on yahoo? Aren't these a bit low with the renewed emphasis on testing?"
150 top--140 support--trade the channel folks
"Boom! up on a bad day, I'll take it."
Delusional joker is as much long as he is short today 
3 down days as Covid is picking up and their product should ge selling like crazy. Amazing.
"LowIQ longs, get your haircut again today! Tuesday is shaping up real fine for Trim! "
"11,00 shares up $2.56. No sellers. In all probability this will lead to buyers, shortly. Watch for news on mu variant. Could be a worse replay of delta. If so, then this will become a HOT sector again. We have the earnings projection increase, now we just need the multiple."
Perhaps the 'expert' analyst naysayers about testing are finally reversing their positions about the need for testing and Quidel's expanded capacity to provide OTC testing will finally be recognized as the huge growth opportunity that will provide the opportunity to more safely the reopening of businesses and schools and allow people to resume travel with more confidence in spite of Covid which is obviously not going away for the forweeable future. Society needs to learn to live with this virus and Quidel is one company geared to help us feel safer living with this reality. Serial rapid testing provides at a much cheaper cost a level of confidence to go about our business and leisure activites and a measure of reassurance. Way better than taking temperatures or waiting 3 or 4 days for more expensive PCR test results.
Have been trying to buy the quick view covid home test for two eeeks now Always sold out. CVS told me they get 10 kits per week and those disappear immediately. What's up with that?
"Was just in my local Walgreens to use my coupons. At the check out counter the Abbot display had QuickVue kits with only 4 left. At least in Texas QDEL is winning the distribution battle. Note dramatic eps est increases posted today. CASH, CASH, CASH on the way."
OK Flix comcede --this stock has a demon guiding it---150 back to 128 down to test the 120 mark---ut oh get those puts folks!!! I warned you--Flix go back to Target cashier!
They may drag it down to 120's before inept CEO DB announces something--Flix is shakin in his boots-getting margin calls from 180 purchase lol
Delusional joker is “net short” todat
Just got my complimentary dinner at Peter Lugers Steakhouse in NY--investors and several board members are saying I convinced DB to start releasing the Krakken(good reports) on QDEL--Itseems my blog has put pressure on DB to cut the BS and move the stock--further news coming
nice buying op today!snatched up some more shares.
I like the idea of $80 profit. in this case price of the stock has to be 32000
For the record expecting a 2 day rally then will sell and short some more!
It will take some time for the recent Q2 good news to kick into Q3/Q4... I expect some trimmings today... Is good for me to reposition for better price...
I wonder where is Mr Haircut
"OH NO--a downgrade by Benzinga--you ask yourself ""how can a co. selling testing with unlimited demand get a downgrade trading at this multiple?""--Flix-- answer the question, Mr. Expert or ask Ridiculus to help"
Decent day for longs on the way to 180 TL--net 75% long with thousands of shares holdin some 150 and 140 puts as a hedge---BTFD--you too Nutflix--get your ave down to 150 soon
The news I was waiting for AAPL to test all emplyees--180 in sight
Notice how news reports are comingout every other day opr so?--Hmmm and look back on my posts here saying if DB doesnt release the Krakken it's over--your welcome QDEL longs--you too Flixsy
How the hell did this stock barely move after pre-releasing an earnings blowout? Thoughts (anyone but DJ)??
Here we go........
Flix et al-- sell here -we are going to 120's-- me and DB need your shares down there
"Quidel is possibly at the foothills of some rapid growth over the next few years. Over the last 20 years it has grown revenue at an average rate of around 28% a year. While last year was without doubt it's best year in terms of growth to date, there is a case for this company continuing to deliver double digit growth for some time. Firstly, it's a relatively small company, 5.5 billion is not that big. It's competing with companies that are much bigger, for example Abbott is at 228 Billion. Secondly they are still innovating. They have 2 product launches this year, Sofia Q and also Savanna. Sofia Q is a small reader for their standard lateral flow tests. Savanna is a molecular product that will bring PCR closer to POC at reduced costs. Search the web for both Sofia Q (A.K.A project sniffles) and Savanna for more details, both revolutionary products.Thirdly, CASH! Last year Quidel earned a significant amount of money. That money is being put to use by paying off debt and also expanding production capabilities. All companies need cash to grow, either they borrow it, float more shares or generate it as a normal part of business. Quidel is going to put that cash to work, which means more growth.There are many tech companies selling at 20 - 50 x sales with little to zero profits. I'd call this a health care tech company and it's selling at 6.5x last years net income... Short term this may be jittery, but long term, it's a bargain at these prices."
"So the delusional joker went from posting that he bought more puts to now saying he is net long???? Wow, talk about a quick footed, double-tounged liar!"
"An ad dropped by a very serious test competitor SRNE in a contract with the DOD. It can be seen on Reddit. The QDEL test isn’t even close in comparison. Approval of SRNE test has been slowed by missing the required manufacturing in US, but that is changed"
"QDEL will soon price at $300“Making QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 Tests conveniently available in-store and online at CVS Pharmacy further supports our shared commitment in meeting the testing needs of American families,” said Douglas Bryant, president and CEO of Quidel. “We experienced a recent surge in demand for our portfolio of Sofia SARS and QuickVue COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, and adding capacity through CVS Pharmacy, a leader in providing testing access throughout the pandemic, will help address customers’ demand.”"
"See ya at $200, then $300?"
Local pharmacies continue to sell out QuickVue Covid home tests as soon as they restockPeople buying three or four kits at a time at bothWalgreens and CVS. On line sales also temporarily sold out awaiting moreinventory Next leg up likely to be triggered by Quidel announcing on September 30 preliminary revenues for third quarter significantly exceeding street estimates and company reporting increasing manufacturing capacity ahead of schedule to meet rapidly increased demand
Let's review here--market up big-world can'y get enough test kits-QDEL one of the big boys--down 4 points--what's wrong with the picture here Flix--explain--I thought not--oh I'm delusional--look in the mirror and stick with Netflix
"Would be nice to see a positive news release about a 3rd quarter revenue estimate beat before the opening bell on Monday, with analysts raising estimates and price targets as a result."
Today's after hours release is huge. It confirms not only increased sales of covid tests but obvious high demand for OTC products from Quidel now available in the largest pharmacy chains in the country. The announcement confirms the capacity to produce 70 million covid tests a month by year end. The OTC tests will be 50 million of that monthly figure. At current retail price the OTC products alone could generate billions in annual sales for QDEL. The other 20 million covid tests to be produced by QDEL sell to the healthcare professional market for even higher prices and margins. Plus Savana is being released in the EU this fall and in the US early next year. The short squeeze begins tomorrow.
"This may have been posted already, but holy cow! Not only did QDEL get the largest share of the order, if each test kits represents one test, then $11.10 is right near the box price of $23.99 for two tests. I am very happy with this announcement...Q4 is looking like a monster. In addition, if you have ever used a Quidel covid test, especially compared to Abbots Binex, Quidel is the most straightforward and easy to use test kit that I am aware of. Nice work! Frin DoD website: Sept 17th, 2021DOD awarded a $284.2 million contract to Quidel Corp. to purchase over-the-counter COVID-19 test kits. Deliveries of the 25.6 million test kits will commence October 2021 and ordering capability will continue until September 2022."

116 floor (110 worst case) is the new 104 floor. I'm fine with it. Who would thought that: 1- covid testing will pick up again 2- almost everybody knows covid will be around for a while. Once again this is undervalued valuation wise and underrated market disruption wise
Well delusional joker just flipped to short 
Who here thinks the Delusional joker would have seen this coming and flipped to long in AH today 
"SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quidel Corporation (NASDAQ: QDEL) (“Quidel”), a leading provider of rapid diagnostic testing solutions, cellular-based virology assays and molecular diagnostic systems, today announced the opening of a new manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, CA that will be dedicated to the production of Quidel’s popular QuickVue line of products. The 128,000 square-foot facility will be the company’s highest-volume production plant in the world and begins operations in the second half of 2021 with a mission to produce 600 million QuickVue SARS rapid antigen tests per year for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 infections.Quidel plans to install multiple manufacturing lines at the Carlsbad facility and hire approximately 400 new employees with a mission to scale Quidel’s operations from 50 million QuickVue tests per year to 50 million tests per month at full capacity, including non-COVID-19 diagnostic assays currently in-market or under development. The company is actively hiring to fill open positions including engineers, chemists, technicians, manufacturing, purchasing, sourcing and support services.“From the first days of the pandemic, Quidel has stepped up to meet the COVID-19 challenge head-on with innovative diagnostic technologies to detect coronavirus infections and expanded manufacturing to democratize access to affordable and high-quality testing,” said Douglas Bryant, president and CEO of Quidel Corporation. “The opening of our massive new QuickVue manufacturing plant is our boldest move yet and is expected to provide Quidel with the scale necessary to serve the needs of communities and institutions for frequent testing now and for years to come.”Quidel received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its QuickVue SARS Antigen Test for COVID-19 in December. The company’s QuickVue lateral-flow technology is visually read by the user and provides results in 10 minutes from nasal swab samples. Initial applications for QuickVue COVID-19 tests range from hospitals and physician offices to schools and pharmacies. Quidel is seeking EUA for a new QuickVue At-Home COVID-19 Test for over-the-counter sale directly to consumers.Quidel’s new QuickVue SARS Antigen test offers excellent performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, with positive results agreeing with PCR 96.6% of the time and negative results agreeing 99.3% of the time, thereby providing quick, reliable results to patients, their families and healthcare workers alike.In the professional segment, Quidel has manufactured the QuickVue line for over 30 years. Quidel was the first company to introduce a visually read flu test, the QuickVue Influenza A/B Test, which received FDA approval in September of 1999. QuickVue was also the first flu test cleared by the FDA for use in CLIA-Waived point-of-care facilities like doctors’ offices, urgent care clinics and pharmacies.Today, Quidel’s QuickVue diagnostic products that test for Influenza, RSV, Strep A, fecal occult blood, pregnancy, chlamydia, infectious mononucleosis, adenoviral conjunctivitis and H. pylori. Over the years, more than 150 million QuickVue diagnostic testing units have been sold."

the KING of covid stocks!I'm calling it right now: 300 by eoy.
All the competitors are up in a weak market--QDEL looking to test the 110 again--hope you folks have your puts/hedges in--Flix has his write offs for 2021 building up bigly!
"Common Sense makes perfect sense. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know that Q2 was going to be mediocre as it is retrospective, not forward looking. Q3 and Q4 will reflect Savanna and covid testing surges with schools, workplaces, concerts etc reopening."

"Good interview on Yahoo finance this afternoon with CEO. He stated that retail of OTC test will be just around the $15 per test mark, 2 tests included in each retail box. He also reiterated that they are heading toward a run rate of 50,000,000 tests per month. Retail, that's a figure of $750,000,000 per month, a large number... And this is only one of their products.Remind me why anyone is selling this stock at these prices?"
"What now is the whole market has pulled back, but QDEL is still a top earner for at least another year or two."
"Up approx. 5% on 190,00 shares. Where do we go with a million share market purchase day? Answer: a heck of a lot higher."
Watchin QDEL is like rooting for the Yankees--tremendous potential-but the team and mgr choke!--Flixy your probably a synchronized swimming fan

"Randall J. Steward -- Chief Financial Officer - There is no flu in Q2. There's no RSV, there's no strep. There is no respiratory season in Q2. If this were a normal prior to COVID year, you wouldn't have asked the question because you would have known that Q2 is our low watermark. We don't do much respiratory testing in Q2."
I was way off on predicting second qtr beating lowered analysts estimates However I see the bottom is in on share price the and seasonal respiratory season will be getting underway as kids return to school and need to regularly test unvaccinated students for flu RSV and Covid will be critical to monitor snd control local outbreaks Home testing with OTC products looks like its growing as well With core market growth reported last quarterIncreased professional segment base using Sofia products.And Savanna soon to be released and company’s increased production capacity available to be used for making tests for whatever pathogens are circulating QDEL is now prepared to resume growth in sales snd eps as Demand for testing increases.
Just remember that last year serious money was made when the market couldn't care less about whether good companies were dirt cheap or not. We are in that moment for Quidel. It might continue to go down but I'm happy adding at regular intervals. As long as what I read points to thid being an undervalued company I will firmly stick with it regardless of the current price action. I belive these guys were caught off guard with collapsing demand from US professional channels and are working on building alternative channels so they reduce reliance on current clients and increase flexibilty as to where the products need to be sold to.
OK WHAT NOW??--tight range here til ice melts and QDEL announces new requirements met and manufacturing at near full capacity and maybe DB announce a new contract--then we get 10 points--Flix dont panic yet just keep those hedges in just in case
"Oh the tangled web perma bulls suffer in this #$%$--with all the supposed ""good news"" out there-one little hiccup and the selling and shorting unravels--you longs are in for a rude awakening on the way to 180--capitulate already!"
"Just took a QuickVue test. Negative thankfully. My first Moderna was 10 days before exposure. The QuickVue test is extremely easy. Quick. 5 stars on everything. Amazon delivery was earlier than anticipated. Living in rural TX, urgent care testing is very long. Today they were sold out of their rapid tests. Also, last week and today the urgent care drive up area had 12 more cars compared to testing in December. Delta is a wildfire right now in TX , and it#$%$ small towns MUCH, MUCH harder than last year. I?ve told close friends buy a kit on Amazon NOW. Have one on hand. Schools are about to start, and I think Delta will explode in school age children. Anyone with kids might consider having a test kit on hand. My opinion, these will sell out everywhere, and Quidel?s revenue will only be constrained by production."
Federal weekly employee testing mandate! buy! Buy! BUY!
"Since you Longs loved your Haircut today, Another one is coming tomorrow for y’all. 135/136 "

Excellent haircut day
Oh ok stopped out --can't get em all right--still made 7% last 2 days--step back DJ--evaluate!
Faster than Spacex?--yes Qdel's move from 135 to 155 and back was Nutflix's first bad trip into space and back in 2 days
Quidel expects revenues in the first quarter of 2021 to be in the range of $374 million to $376 million. That's obviously disapointing given the 450m estimate provided by the CEO. Looking forward to Q2 but for now the stock will remain under pressure. Still hopeful for long term though
that's it. Retracement is over. who wants to buy more the time is now. next move $175-$177.
Sqeeze out Flix and the longs so I can rebuy at 110--love it CEO laughing right now
Attention QDEL shoppers--theres a big sale on QDEL stock in isle 3--OK Flixy and Ridicilus--whos your Daddy?--oh oh that DJ is a joke etc etc etc----- as he calls every move and warns buyers to back off!---bwahaaaa dont listen then
I’m assuming QDEL will be well positioned to get a good share of the work place testing requirements that just came out
"Mr. Bryant added, ""Thanks to our stay-the-course strategy and ever-expanding footprint in the professional and retail channels, Quidel is better positioned to supply product in response to the recent surge in testing demand sparked by the rapid spread of the Delta variant. As a result, over the last month, we have experienced a marked increase in SARS category revenues for the third quarter-to-date 2021 and have surpassed the total COVID-related revenue in the second quarter of 2021. If we have learned anything over the past 18-months, it is that while the testing environment has been, and remains fluid, it is wise to further invest in, and enhance, our agility as the landscape continues to evolve.""Mr. Bryant concluded, ""Additionally, in the quarter and consistent with our strategy to expand access to affordable testing, we have been working with educational institutions to provide free diagnostic product in underserved communities. We look forward to sharing more on these and other initiatives in the future but can report with confidence today that there continues to be both a strong need for COVID testing and an opportunity for us to do our part."""
What's everyone's price target?
"So far, the market response has been a yawner. The REAL story for this stock will be the 4th quarter when the company will have the full benefit of recently opened production in Carlsbad along with higher prices. It seems certain for the next few years at least that testing will be the norm everywhere."
"Mu variant reported as a new antibody resistant strain of Covid already found in 47 states in the US and in many other countries. Tiny fraction of total cases in the US, but as the delta strain finishes it's run, will Mu become the next wave? New treatments and different vaccines may be needed and of course, testing."
Anyone heard how the new 128k square foots manufacturing facility at Carlsbad is going? Predicted to scale approx. 10x to 50million tests a month (from 50 million a year.Thanks
"From Cardinal Health Corp press release August 10, 2021 announcing expanded collaboration distributing rapid antigen testing solution programs from Quidel:[Quidel CEO] Bryant added, ""Cardinal Health and Quidel continued working together on a massive distribution push to get our Sofia SARS rapid antigen assay out to the largest health system in the U.S. – and this latest distribution partnership is another critical step forward in Quidel's efforts to democratize access to our testing solutions, including our QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 antigen."" Perhaps QDEL will soon be announcing the implementation of the Sofia rapid antigen assay to be used by the largest health system in the US. This perhaps accounts for the jump in stock price near the end of the trading yesterday. Abbot mistakenly closed it's Maine Binax manufacturing plant and destroyed component inventory and laid off hundreds of workers last month. Quidel has been increasing it's manufacturing capacity during the past months and said it was ready to supply it's tests as demand required. That moment of increased demand has now arrived. Quidel likely has the advantage of being able to deliver it's tests in sufficient numbers to compete with Abbot and others whose production capacity may be limited by prior cutbacks in both personal and manufacturing."
THE BATTLE at 145--watch it!
Gonna bust DB's chops til he puts out a positive review without the if's and maybe's etc--grow a pair DB!
Total short massacre coming soon.Keep buying every dip.At 300 some of these nasty HFs who have been spreading FUD as they tanked this will go bust. Karma!
Buy here. Sell in April for $190. That's my prediction.
"On June 1, Raymond James analyst Andrew Cooper reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a $160 price target (39.4% upside potential).Cooper believes despite a demand decline, “an instrumented option like Sofia will win in a true clinical setting versus visually read options. Multiyear contracts should translate to a stable customer base as well (versus clinicians likely moving away from visually read tests).”Based on 3 Buys and 1 Sell, consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy. The QDEL average analyst price target of $126.67 implies 10.4% upside potential.That’s after shares have seen a 39.7% price correction so far this year."
"In case you missed, the joker is long again "
"Conference call end of month will likely give some guidance about demand and production capacity which IMO will project revenue generated in the current quarter to be over two times that of the 2nd quarter just released. Add to that new products likely to be discussed as future revenue streams (Covid antibody tests and Barda grant subsidized respiratory panel POC rapid diagnostic on Sofia, and initiation of Savanna platform clinical trials for expected approval and sale of new breakthrough product for molecular testing.)"
DJ is a technical trader now. Look at WILLIAMS %R. Maybe then you`ll stop make you bearish predictions.
"Okay, found the culprit. Looks like there's 19% short interest currently on the stock (I had never checked before, but some of these recent rapid moves made no sense). That's way higher than I expected. I would have guessed maybe 3-4%. And the stock has a very small float (total shares available to trade). Both of those things are contributing to these wild swings. The short sellers probably love that qdel investors will quickly/reactively sell when the stock goes red (recency bias - fear of a huge drop if bad news crops up). It also sets up a beautiful short squeeze from time to time which in hindsight explains some of the huge moves up. Those big rapid moves up are the shorts covering. And the big down moves are the shorts taking advantage of the large big bid/sell spreads on this stock and scared holders rapidly selling with market orders. It's actually rare to have an undervalued stock with huge growth potential that also has high short interest. I'm guessing the short sellers think that once Covid is over the huge rev/EPS growth will drop and they'll get paid. The CEO of Pfizer was on CNBC recently and said Covid isn't going away. Essentially we'll need to get booster shots for variants every year. And people will continue getting tested. Kind of flu 2.0. That's bad/frustrating news as we all want things to normalize, but great news for QDEL and other testing companies. Why do you think they are building a huge new manufacturing facility in the US? Because the increased volume is here to stay. You can look all of this up. Start researching and stop selling. Be informed, not reactive."
Yeah - it just a matter of time here before this thing pops up. Honestly surprised that with increased cases it is now on its 4th red day. Slowly buying more.
"Hammered all you long boys today! Bottom is still not in. Going below $100. I gotta thank the incompetent CEO Bryant, he has made me bank shorting this Turkey! There are skeletons in the closet on this Turkey, be careful. Shorting QdEL is the only play if you want to make money in the near term (CY21)."
"MMs have been shaking weak hands out of this stock for a while. Given the parabolic rise in share price, pandemic speculation and math-challenged executive suite that can provide only opaque guidance it is not surprising a lot of people bailed out. However, we are well past oversold and I would expect to see a bounce up to at least the 200dma. In the short to mid term things look solid--hardly any debt, lots of cash on hand, earnings will be spectacular, new home testing on the horizon. Several scenarios suggest themselves as to why this stock has fallen but since I'm not a conspiracy theorist and do not see this stock as a 1-trick pony offering only covid testing I'm inclined to just chill for a while. I would not add given lack of any guidance but I see no reason to sell."
1000 in six years
WE got the PR news wire at 945 which propped her up a few points--gonna need to see this kind of stuff every few days to get QDEL running--too many shorts and non believers out there because of DB--Flix is obsesssed with my trading ability--cant stay that I'm in and out and building big alpha doin it--he wants to baghold for another year til he gets even at 190
That was wierd

"another great news for Quidel, as USA decided today that it will ease traveling restrictions, but travelers will have to be with negative Covid test up to 72 hours before flight.there will by another demand for tests."
Got a little crew cut from QDEL today as my puts would not cover the sell off--still a lot of sellers to take this down-thats why I prefer to trade it--Nutflix--watch and learn skippy!
"this is has been manipulated totally in the last week. you watch an upgrade is coming and this goes back to 150 in a heart beat. and that bank/financial will pat itself on the back for being right as their recommendation preforms like they forecast it will. seen this so many times,"
Ok kids whats in store---no news will stall it between 135-140 -if don't hear any news within a week -back to 130 or lower--too many bagholders like FLIX trying to get out with less than 40% loss----DB must announce facility fully staffed and pumping out test kits to CVS and foreign countries--will he?
Gonna scare you first--flirt with below 130 then DJ goes long!
"“United States COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations highest in six months, led by Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana”To all in the USA:- take care from New Zealand :-)."
DB wants your shares Flix at 125--can you hang in there?
WOW--I picked up 26 points this week on the long and short side of QDEL--what did you sheeple make 2 points? If you keep listening to Uncommon sense-- Nutflix and their 10 share groupies you will prolly lose $$$ The secret admirers here realize that DJ is like Kreskin--he sees the future and knows what the moves are in QDEL--Next week I see move coming more to come!
Analysts finally substantially raised their earnings projections for the second half of the year and also raised estimates for next year. The stock is ridiculously undervalued given the demand for it's products. The stock price should fly if company gives a preliminary revenue announcement for the third quarter this Friday as it has done in the past.
The earnings report is backwards looking. There has been an enormous change in demand for testing this quarter. And demand continues to increase as we go into the school openings. This querter will be much improved. When is the conference call?
The company is so undervalued. Ripe for rapid move up or being acquired by a larger diagnostics company ready to capitalize on the company's growling production capacity market share and growth potential thanks to it's extensive and growing diagnostics menu of testing in both molecular and rapid POC immunoassay tests for both Covid and non Covid infections and other diseases.
To my followers---trade this baby tomorrow --prolly 10 point moves coming--stay tuned!--PS don't listen to Flix and his minions--they are in for some whipsaw horrors here!
"Maybe due to Merck’s COVID pill news? If so, just a temporary blip. Also, keeping an eye on the long game post COVID. Savanna!"
So with the comeback of COVID and increase in testing why is QDEL back down? It should be MUCH higher.
Truly unreal with this price action. Zero logic. Holding but this is frustrating to see.
Back in. QDEL is going to continue to kill it. It's only a matter or time for NY and CA to surge. Oregon/Washington now in same spot as Florida / Texas.
NO NEWS is BAD NEWS--she will drift lower without it!
Short's be like...
Buy the dip!
Dj has been added to your ignore list ... but hey Dj ... Play that Funky Music!
Another large contract announcement or an analyst upgrade and the stock will continue to gap up. Shorts squeeze will follow
"After QDEL hit $135 Tuesday, it's been trading lower rest of the week. On Tuesday evening I saw an Article from a trade rag titled - ""QDEL trading higher even when Analysts are cutting price target"".I read that Article. I recalled that same article was published 4 months ago. And republished as a fresh piece of news on 29 Jun. Old stuff - out of context - marked as new. This means there is manipulative short interest in QDEL. Milking the Covid Testing uncertainty. The reason to buy and hold QDEL is not because covid testing may spike, but because QDEL is an established and premier Diagnostics/Testing company with a proven record to (1) develop new tests quickly and (2) ramp production quickly. It's books are very healthy - something that is not common in public companies. It's been around since 1979. I had done analysis on QDEL - month ago post. With 0 covid testing revenue, fair value of QDEL was $100 then. With SPX moving up since then - value has risen to $103. That to me is the bottom in the worst case (0 covid revenue). I'll be adding in $110s and even $100s, if it gets there. Of course Covid spikes and variants will be the reason we'll get to see $20-$50 up moves. Savanah and Sofia will continue to be growth drivers - them alone driving QDEL to $200+"
Blows away estimates or just blows . Down 2.22 on great news????
"QDEL - the KING of covid stocks!And is it angry about that short manipulation fest that took place friday? you bet..most of those shorts used that orchestrated to take down to cover... the smart ones..but you can bet there were a few that didn't, and all I can say is after the way they've destroyed this stock on fake news for the last few months, they deserve what's comin to them - most likely bankruptucy...don't think i'm wishin harm on these poor manipualtive folks.. i'm sure they'll recover quickly, with an insider tip on a doomed company to short from their friends.. or if they are a big enough fund the fed will step in and give them a free few billion...i'm under no illusions these criminals will be begging in the streets any time soon..nevertheless it's nice to know they'll be squirming the whole way up to 300+"
how about earnings of 80 bucks a share in the last quarter! Is this possible? I actually think that it is a possible reality.
Saying Hi to JP Morgan with their $90>>$80 target price cut
How long is the upward run gonna last?
"The largest channels of testing have switched to vaccination. This is defintely reducing testing volumes. On the other hand, vaccination is accelerating reopening. With reopening, increased activities, travel and events, the need for testing will increase again until all us population is vaccinated. Back to normal means allowing more international travelers in and these might come from countries with far less vaccination coverage thus requiring testing as well when they arrive and before they depart. It is likely testing will increase again and stay important for at least 12/18 months. Anyone agree ?"
Up another $4.16 after hours. Longs enjoy the weekend. Shorts might want to think about covering and buying more shares. Should be a great finish to the month. Maybe over the weekend Reddit investors will see the short squeeze potential here?

"This evening, after the close it was announced that QDEL was just added to S&P 400. Stock price already moving up after hours. Short covering plus mandatory purchase by mutual funds indexed to S&P 400 may push stock price back up to 52 week highs next week.When company announces FDA approval of Sofia Covid IGG and IGM tests it will be likely go even higher. BARDA grant for company to manufacture Respiratory panel for Influenza AB RSV and Covid will hopefully be approved for Sofia platform this coming flu season. Quidel's Savana molecular platform will be likely approved in early 2021 for rapid diagnosis of multiple panels of diseases with a single specimen which will be a game changer for the entire molecular diagnostics industry."
"Some perspective on production numbers. In 2008 Global IPod sales peaked at 54.83 million units per year. In 2015 IPhone sales peaked at 231 million units per year. By EOY 2021, Quidel plans to increase capacity of its Quickvue At-home Product to 600 million units per year, and its Sofia platform is planned to increase to 240 million tests a year."
You longs are going to loose every penny of your investment in QDEL. Your hope and pray strategy and throwing darts for positive price movement is hilarious! You just dot grasp the Negative Fundamentals and Technicals in play.
What are the best known stocks for rapid at home covid testing?QDEL.CODX and what else..?
DJ's short position will cost him. Trying to induce panic selling on a stock with a low P/E and a bullish outlook on revenue and earnings is silly.
What news is out?
"Treatment has no impact on testing and I suspect no impact on vaccinations either. Testing and vaccinations are to prevent infection and treatment is a cure. When going to school, kids cannot just take the pill every week instead of testing. Meaningless drop which has caused a meaningful dent to the stock price. Hopefully people will realize that this is senseless and buy again. Some pre-announcements wont hurt here."
Interest waning and shorts starting to slowly put a top in at 130-as i said a few days ago--no news on it and down it goes--increased my puts today Flix--stick with NFLX
Excellent haircut action today for silly Longs! Bzzzzzzzzzz.
Ok kids-heres the plan--let it fluctuate tomorrow--if you got your puts in ride em---this will bottom out soon and the covid scare ou there may bring this pup back to where dont know but I dont see her under 125
I am sure DJ bought it 1 minute before closing. LOL
I wouldn't worry about the share price for a few months. The next earnings report should show the test sales for the Delta variant surge.
Ok Flix don't jump yet!--Hope you shorted where I said--DB come up with some news or its goin sub 140--I'll be buyin soon--you bagholders keep praying-someday you'll break even
Covid testing is through the roof right now. Test are sold out at my Wagreens.
I have shared this link multiple times but it might help people not aware of this data source which by the way is showing that testing is skyrocketing ! https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states
The sheeple--Flix and gang all hyped up that Db finally released some news loaded with ifs and buts---careful--the bears will be shorting this GAP
"I'm guessing the company may have already pulled the trigger on the 150 million share buyback. There was some higher than usual share volume around the beginning of June. They also reported they had around 750 million in cash on the books during the last conference, this number was in the 900 million + range on the last report. This is great news as 150 million is approximately 3% of market cap, but they bought it back at a huge discount. We'll know at the next earnings as it will be reported on the quarterly.The future growth of this company with increased telemedicine and POC technology is huge. Amazon is also moving into this space, that should tell you something about the size of the market. I wouldn't be surprised if someone ends up buying Quidel, but it won't be for today's price. Another worthy point of note for this last quarter, they increased their cash position by almost half a billion. 1 quarter, half a billion, in cash. That is a huge amount of cashflow for this size of company, almost unheard of.Lastly, where is the company going? All this talk of covid ending, no need for testing etc. I'm not an expert in infectious deceases, but I can read financial statements. The company has over 300% more raw materials on the books ready for this year's season as compared to last years. They know they are going to sell more this year, hence the new 128,000 foot factory and increased capacity.Everybody on the planet is a potential repeat customer."
WHOA! my 135 max area hitting --Flix is only down 50% now from his 190 purchase---does it have legs?--bought more puts
https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2780251/dod-awards-647-million-in-contracts-for-over-the-counter-covid-19-test-kits/
Look what a little negative news does to this stock--always be hedged folks--this will be a saga not a v shaped move from 110
Sold my puts at 10 this morn--bought some stock at 122 will hold til my indicator flashes sell and then short--hope you guys made some coin--but FLIX you gotta be downin some Mylanta!
"Is Quidel building an antibody test? Should be a great need with elderly, immunocompromised and general public interest in knowing when they need a booster"
If you don't see a guidance release or a big contract signed signed soon--110 is coming soon to a theatre near you--but keep buying like FLIX--he has averaged down to 200 now! LOL
