"CYBER CRIME IS RAMPANT, and will only get worse. PANW will see the $600s - $800s."
"IF CMG CAN GO UP TO $2,000 FROM SELLING MEXICAN FOOD,PANW SHOULD BE AT LEAST WORTH $600s-$800s with PROTECTING PERSONAL/FINANCIAL DATA IMO. "
"At what point does PANW consider a split? 4:1?? 8:1?? Is a $50 stock more attractive to buyers with $2,000 or funds?"
The earnings wasn't THAT good! This thing is going to go down quickly with such a big gap and mediocre earnings. Way overbought...
Congratulations to the longs on PANW and CRWD.. cyber security should be a concern for everyone 
Yeah valuation is to high now. I’m taking profits here. If we shoot even farther may even consider puts. I think market will see downside for rest of week into next week
The Sec should investigate what is going on In this stock.
$PANW is on volatility region. It will drop to a point which will force you to intact for a long long time. I would stay away from buying or even keeping my positions!

Why does my online broker and Yahoo show negative earnings over the past 12 months?
PANW GOING TO $600s-$800s IMO.
that's 4 days in a row! Over a dozen brokers upping their price target. Nothing but good news today for Palo Alto!
"i just don't understand a company with negative 2 billion tangible assets and 9 billion liabilities that are for real being able to stay out of bk. management must thread a needle. must raise cash or renegotiate debt somewhere repeatedly. luckily they are not depending on me to do it. good luck all, i am taking some profit."
