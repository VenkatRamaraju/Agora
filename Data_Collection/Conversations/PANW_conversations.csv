Why does my online broker and Yahoo show negative earnings over the past 12 months?
"i just don't understand a company with negative 2 billion tangible assets and 9 billion liabilities that are for real being able to stay out of bk. management must thread a needle. must raise cash or renegotiate debt somewhere repeatedly. luckily they are not depending on me to do it. good luck all, i am taking some profit."
