"Great Earnings report tonight, it will skyrocket just like $PANW"
Wish us luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Is investing exciting or what? Does history repeat itself for panw? the last 2 earnings reports, panw were in light sold off mode and surged after earnings reports. I love building my position at this level on weakness. it is low risk to go long here provided we know panw has good growth and no warning issued at this point; therefore, the upside is huge and downside is limited. the edge is presented here, should I take it or could it be a falling knife. Here is what I am going to do, moderately accumulate today"
Puts!
"I AM BUYING MORE $ZNOG SHARES, THEY ARE CHEAP, OIL NEWS DUE SOON, BIG PR MAYBE"
Why are we so negative
Keeps getting rejected from $459. Has to cool off a bit
Spent additional 120 million to get 100 million in additional revenue.
Earnings and revenues looks good. Any ideas what the stock will do tomorrow ? After hours seems to be a dud
HUGE DISCOUNT BUYING TODAY ON THE JANUARY 2022 $450 CALLS.
Does that say +$66?? 
Why is iron net tanking ?
Just follow the accelerated trends....the more businesses shift to the cloud means more demand for premium cybersecurity.
"With earnings declining 10% YoY and revenue at a not-stellar +17% YoY, we better jump boat here and move to Zscaler. Their earnings are still growing while revenue is over +50% YoY. They are taking customers from PANW. I think we ran our course here and I prefer to take $220 other than watch it go down to $150 without doing anything."
Ouch ! Maybe be time to add to my position in a day or two

What's up with this today? I didn't hear any negative news...
On the 14th analysts reiterated buys with price targets of as high as $180. Lets see if they raise the PT any higher.
In at $142.21 Out at $152.50. Held since last Friday. Great trade. Now into BZUN with earnings out after the close.
"I was an early Crowdstrike shareholder but sold out of my position because the stock got way too expensive and now I'm looking to get in Palo Alto. I'm willing to sacrifice the higher growth rate for a far better valued stock in a space that will see increased spending. I was wondering when to get into the stock, any ideas? I feel like the stock will go down the $335 level it tested January and if doesn't hold that then back down to the $290 level. I want to average in between those two prices, thoughts? Should I buy here at $350?"

"We keep winning awards in the industry but we are not moving. $PANW earnings today should boost us, I hope."
"I do respect everyone's opinion here but I work in the same sector as this company and these guys are changing business model at the moment due to which they had revenue miss last time. Almost all the stocks these days are bloated so it's not only this one. But this company has right products and customers want them. Their debt/equity, current etc ratios are not too bad compared to some other super bloated stocks and in fact good if we factor in their recent acquisitions. I truly believe this will be back into 200-220 once the market is back so there is surely an upside here. I would have loved to by this stock in 150s but hey I can't put all the eggs in one basket as I do already own a lot of this company at just a bit higher price. All the best to all!"
"i am not a cyber security investor. congradulations to you all who have been long haulers it has paid off. i have a question about these companies. if i pay these companies to protect my data, my info and also others who entrust me with their personal info, how does their stock rise when there firewall or security protecting you fails? the hackers break through their work and you have to pay millions for ransom and at the same time the security company u been paying lots of money to for protection, and failed, their stock rises. where we come from if your work fails or your job is not suitable and messes up, you pay for any damages until everything is back to normal and then you're fired. looks to me the security companys can have someone to hack systems that they made and stocks go up and collect ransom. it is win win for them. if u dont think so check the history of all hacks, the ransoms paid and how much stocks go up each time. if someone cleans your house everyday for 2 years and u come home and everything in your house has been stolen or broken to bits and pieces because u saw them do it on your camera are u going to invite them back with a big smile and give them a big raise? just wonderin"
Why is PANW reporting premarket this time? They have always reported afterhours.Any thoughts?
"Oh man, what a spike today, I missed it :("
I've owned this stock continously since the week of its IPO back in 2012. I just put an order in to sell at 240.50 I'm going all cash liqudating all stocks and will be on the sidelines for the next 2 months at least. I've sold stocks I've held for more than a decade. I have never shorted a stock and I've never bought a Put contract. I'm the pure definition of a long. I did not make this decision hastily. Good luck to everyone. See you on the other side of this election and covid.
Congrats Longs! Have one my behalf tonight :)cheers
Strong report with guidance. $255 within next two weeks

LOOKING FOR A DISCOUNT DIP ON THOSE OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLS 
Still can’t believe this hasn’t taking a dip since skyrocketing. Steady incremental climb each day since. No shorts here?
PANW to be listed on the NASDAQ on Oct 25th
"Great earnings and guidance, looking for $182 - $185 tomorrow."
Congratulations to the longs on PANW and CRWD.. cyber security should be a concern for everyone 
Cramer said it’s good to take some of the table and reposition back later. Normal
"The stock beat on top line and bottom line; they're a VERY good company, expanding now via buying-up other web security companies. Their guidance was bad, so if the stock goes to $225.00 it would be a GREAT buying opportunity, long term."
"Based on PANW’s excessive legacy’s products and business and the stock chart, I am shorting this stock at the open. Apologies to all longs but wake up."
I picked the wrong cyber stock in PANW I should have gone with CRWD
TOLD YOU BROKE SHORTS TO COVER A LONG TIME AGON
Palo Alto Networks is up 13.41% to 422.54
Yeah valuation is to high now. I’m taking profits here. If we shoot even farther may even consider puts. I think market will see downside for rest of week into next week
"CONGRATS TO THE DISCOUNT BUYERS ON THE OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLSNICE CONSISTENT BUYING CHEAPER ON WEAKNESS, FOR MASSIVE GAINS LATER "
"Very interesting, panw announced its quarterly report date is shifting 9 days. Is this a sign that it needs to extend its number of day to make up the short fall of rev? don't know if this the case and if it is, eventually the sharp analysts will figure its out, and we could see a big hair cut. on the other hand if the everything is normal, we still should see a medium hair cut. current price has built in assuming that panw will have another blown out quarter, good growth, good rev, and good outlook. anything short of this, who know where this baby will be ... very normal we see 10-15% down from here. my probabilistic model suggests to sell at this level which is 160. this is what I have been doing, but I could be wrong. good luck to all and happy trading (of course this including me). cheers ... I want opposing views and want to see I am missing."
how do you think about the earnings?
"Buyers a fighting hard for this one. Even with two positive days in the market, this obviously isn’t gaining traction. Charts don’t lie trend is down. Next two days will be interesting."
"Just wait until tomorrow. Once institutions can trade, this stock will hit $190/share."
that's 4 days in a row! Over a dozen brokers upping their price target. Nothing but good news today for Palo Alto!
"Did PANW buy back shares, I don't see it mentioned in the report. They show 96.7 million shares, in Q2 was 98.3 million. I went back through all reports, and this is the 1st time they ever decreased shares. Cash went down $500 million, so it would seem to point to share buybacks. Have they announced buyback funds in the past?"
Too high valuation
This is likely funds unloading positions to lock in profits before mid term election and macroeconomic uncertainty. What has changed in PANW since it's last quarter blockbuster earnings report? Nothing fundamental has changed IMO.
awesome
I heard on the news the new CEO but back 6 million shares today.
$PANW is on volatility region. It will drop to a point which will force you to intact for a long long time. I would stay away from buying or even keeping my positions!
"SLOWLY ACCUMULATE/BUY THOSE OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLS CHEAPER AS PANW TEMPORARY GOES LOWER, TO MAKE MASSIVE GAINS LATER. IN MY OPINION "

"This sounds pretty good to me! Morgan Stanley Lifts Palo Alto Networks PT to $320 From $281, Maintains Overweight Rating. GLTA!"
"Over the past year as the company has recovered from negative perceptions in 2017, Palo Alto Networks has emerged as one of the few SaaS companies that has a demonstrated ability to scale up to multi-billion dollar run rates while continuing to improve profitability. Of the companies that have reached this ~$ 3 billion revenue rung, very few have been able to maintain ~30% growth - and those that have, like Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), are rewarded by much higher multiples, typically a double-digit forward revenue valuation, than Palo Alto Networks. On that basis, alone, I believe Palo Alto Networks still has plenty of room to rise higher.I believe Palo Alto Networks to be worth at least 20x EV/FY19 FCF, which implies a price target of of $289 and 27% upside from current levels. Stay long on this name as it continues to execute on a rarefied growth story in a critical pr"
Anyone know why crowdstrike and zscaler are going up the past week while Palo Alto has dropped 30 dollars? Thanks!
"time for new annual high, and then all time highs 200"
Over valued …
Seems like a bit of a overreaction for a company that beat expectations again and is only projecting lower 4q based on acquiring companies to better position themselves in the future
tech market is vry bullish buy around $200 will keep going up. nothing stopping the trend now
No dip???? Very surprising
"How can this company is still loosing money? They were (now everybody followed) disruptive with the whole appID, replaced half of the fw on earth and r clear leader in gartner. what more needs to happen so they actually have profit? I am looking at the fortinet and they have huge net margin. Whats wrong with PAN?"
Pali alto. Administration charged with insider trading. This is not a surprise! This happens 100’s of times a day in the stock market. It’s just a matter of getting caught. And they got caught!!!
Will this dip bounce back before the market opens tomorrow?
Lack of trading discipline is the primary reason for intraday trading losses it is estimated that nearly 80-85% of intraday traders end up losing money in the stock market Experiencing loss is also part of the game but that don't mean you should give up.
I just bought before the close
$PANW Who thinks this will open in red tomorrow morning in extended hours trading?
How soon will PANW reach $500?
We did it! 160$ in the next few days
Welcome to the Wall Street rigged Casino. We hope the Longs enjoy their stay here. How we operate is to take your stock 17 points HIGHER and DUMP it to close NEGATIVE and at the low of the day.Thanks again for playing.
"After hours,,,,, yikes"
"Searching the bottom.If you hold it, strongly sell now.Around $350 is safe zone to buy and hold.For long term, PANW would be rally.For short term, you should enjoy the dropping."
"CYBER CRIME IS RAMPANT, and will only get worse. PANW will see the $600s - $800s."
earnings per adjusted share....so not GAAP
"This is about as brilliant as an earnings report you can get! PANW is headed to all time highs, and probably will be kissing 200 very soon"
bought 500 at 142.50 as posted. I get to eat well tonight
This will open at 165 tomorrow
"i just don't understand a company with negative 2 billion tangible assets and 9 billion liabilities that are for real being able to stay out of bk. management must thread a needle. must raise cash or renegotiate debt somewhere repeatedly. luckily they are not depending on me to do it. good luck all, i am taking some profit."
Up or down before ER? After ER?
"On the hunt for my next Pure Earnings Short Sell play, I found three very promising candidates: PANW, ROST, and VFC. But which one is the most Bloated Baby of them all?? The answer is: PANW. Later tomorrow, after I Cover my MNRO Short Sell, I plan to throw all my hard cash into a Short Sell of PANW, ahead of her earnings release after market close tomorrow. I think PANW will sell off HARD right after her earnings release. What is bizarre is that multiple analysts are EXTREMELY bullish right now on PANW, predicting stock price jumps all the way to the $500 level! Well, I listen and follow only Myself, and here is what I see in PANW:1: Stock is significantly over-valued. 2: Company is not profitable. 3: PANW is accumulating debt at an unusually high rate. 4: Company has average to poor overall financials: Return On Equity is weak. EPS Growth Rate is downright bad. 5: Insider Selling is absolutely horrific. Insiders are DUMPING PANW. Not just one, but many. The Chief Technology Officer sold 12,000 shares on 4/8/21, another 12,000 shares on 3/2/21, another 12,000 shares on 2/1/21, another 12,000 shares on 1/4/21. Can anyone say No Confidence?? 6: If you analyze recent quarterly earnings reports, you will find something very interesting: PANW always beats consensus estimates on Revenue, but always misses consensus estimates on EPS. In fact, they have missed EPS consensus estimates for the past EIGHT consecutive quarters. I think right now, with tomorrow's earnings release, this stock will take a 5-12% hit to the downside based upon weak numbers that bring current over-valuation into clear and undeniable focus."
Do you think PANW stock will go higher tomorrow post ER? Thumps up for UP and thumps down for DOWN trend.
what's the reason today for erasing one month of gains?
Keep playing the golden rule!!!!
"My assessment of yesterday's earnings report: Positives: Revenue beat, ability to give company guidance for next quarter, guidance fairly good given pandemic uncertainty, more than 1500 customers currently doing free trials or POCs. Tons of analyst community price target increases this morning.Negatives: Per share metrics were better than expected due to share float being reduced by about 1.6% this quarter. Unclear to me how they did this, was it via share buy back? Subscription revs were a bit disappointing when I was expecting a HR due to the pandemic."
Watch how it drops so quick
Oh baby starting green...
Congratulations to all share holders. Any opinions on how high this might go? Please...just fact based answers. GLTA
"Of the 37 analysts who cover Palo Alto Networks, 31 have buy ratings, five have hold ratings, and one has a sell rating. Of those, 16 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock Thursday, while two raised theirs, resulting in an average price target of $267.91, according to FactSet data."
The earnings wasn't THAT good! This thing is going to go down quickly with such a big gap and mediocre earnings. Way overbought...
The Sec should investigate what is going on In this stock.
PANW sold off after earnings for profit taking. Others sold it because they got scared and didn’t know what to do other than follow the crowd. Stock should be jumping back another 5-8% very short term.
I hope in 2021 we can get back to trading on financials and not emotions & news headlines.
Thanks for letting me add more today
WHOA!!! HAHAHHA TIMBER!
Reports upbeat revenue guidance!
there will be a quick spike follwed by profit sales. i see it settling around 250 for few days.

Never buy stocks during earnings day … will end up in big RED!
Palo Alto Networks (PANW) PT Raised to $317 at Citi
"I thought I would buy some at this level but, WOW forward guidance was really bad!! This is not going away for a long time.I will not be interested with this bad guidance! Folks that bought at $240 are going to be waiting a long time for even!"
This is worthwhile: https://techstockobserver.com/palo-alto-networks-inc-nysepanw-gets-ready-to-rock-or-be-rocked/
the forward earning estimate is lower than street estimate. revenue growth slowin. stock price need to adjust
Clients are now dumping Global Protect which will affect next Earnings profit.
"Sold Short a lot of shares of PANW a few hours ago, at $342.18 average price. So far in the AH session the stock has been acting perky on a better than expected earnings report. But my plan is to stay short at least until tomorrow afternoon. So often these perky AH or PM moves collapse and turn Red once the regular market session gets underway. I will be running this one with a 10% Bracketed, Conditional OCO Buy Cover order. Giving myself a chance to get big profit if she collapses tomorrow, while at the same time trying to limit my loss to a very manageable 10% in case the upside trend continues and intensifies. Good Luck! :-)"
Apparently a Crowdstrike insider just dumped like 9 mil of Crowdstrike. Wonder what's about to go down. Could be Palo Alto's gain after this chain of losses.
"The thesis for investing in Cybersecurity has not changed.The recent sell-off in Tech stocks is due solely due to interest rate fears. The market as usual overreacted. This presents an opportunity. The thesis for investing in Cybersecurity has not changed and Palo Alto remains one of the most financially sound companies in this space. PANW is now trading 14% lower than it was in January. We are buyers at this level. Despite all the warnings and high-profile breaches, that state of readiness for most when it comes to cybersecurity is dismal. In our ever-increasing digitalized world of cybersecurity, threats keep growing. Nearly 80% of senior IT and IT security leaders believe their organizations lack sufficient protection against cyberattacks despite increased IT security investments made in 2020 to deal with distributed IT and work-from-home challenges, according to a new IDG Research Services survey commissioned by Insight Enterprises. The Cybersecurity Market is Forecasted To Be Worth $403B by 2027. Palo Alto Networks reported solid F2Q21 results by beating estimates on all metrics and provided guidance ahead of consensus estimates. Total revenue was $1,017 million and was ahead of the consensus estimate of $986 million, driven by solid momentum in its cloud business. EPS was $1.55 and beat the consensus estimate of $1.43, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage. We feel that the stock sell-off since the report is a good buying opportunity that won't last. As always do your due diligence and be careful out there. Best of fortune to all"
"CRWD sold after hour, it might impact sentiment for all cybersecurity including PANW, FEYE, ZS, OKTA and many more"
"Share prices are going up, they have invested in the purchasing of companies to expand and grow the services provided. More veteran Silicon Valley executives were hired, this company is not looking back. The active customers are buying more services and upgrading, they are turning pending customers into active with their proven track record!"
"I would add to this under 200 bucks tomorrow, but there are going to be way better deals on way better stocks in the next few days. This one will hurt, but I don't own that much of it...."
Always a good day to pump up a Commie stock on the American Mao Stock Market. Security is solid these days. See T-Mobile.
As usual.
"At what point does PANW consider a split? 4:1?? 8:1?? Is a $50 stock more attractive to buyers with $2,000 or funds?"
PANW GOING TO $600s-$800s IMO.
It’s going up tomorrow $235+
nice
"My neighbor works at PANW and told me to load up huge with the stock before earning and I did not listen. I only listened until today after the big jump, but I do see this going to $200!"
"there are no more RSI's or MCD or any technicals matter anymore, its the golden rule, He who holds gold rules!!!"
If this beats and has decent guidance it will go up $10-15 over the next couple weeks... however if this misses or has bad guidance it’s going to $180-190...
as expected. some players take profits. sold at 255 waiting to get back. will settle in 2 - 3 days then steady climbing to 275 and more. also any price update will spike the price. great company glta.
panw is way over value and is going to be adjusted to its fair value. glad was able to short again this morning rally. good luck to all and happy trading.
Where is this heading from 154? Time to get out or wait until end of week?
