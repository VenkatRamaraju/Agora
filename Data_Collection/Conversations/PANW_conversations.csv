Will this dip bounce back before the market opens tomorrow?
"CYBER CRIME IS RAMPANT, and will only get worse. PANW will see the $600s - $800s."
what are the fundamentals that are driving PANW stock up so much? i haven't seen anything that would make it go up 15 bucks in less than a week. What am i missing? earnings aren't until next month.
Why is PANW down today with the US stock market up so much?
as expected. some players take profits. sold at 255 waiting to get back. will settle in 2 - 3 days then steady climbing to 275 and more. also any price update will spike the price. great company glta.
Does that say +$66?? 
"As consultant to retail companies, I moved 2 big luxury retail from PANW appliances+firewall+switches to ZScaler."
Welcome to the Wall Street rigged Casino. We hope the Longs enjoy their stay here. How we operate is to take your stock 17 points HIGHER and DUMP it to close NEGATIVE and at the low of the day.Thanks again for playing.
"I would add to this under 200 bucks tomorrow, but there are going to be way better deals on way better stocks in the next few days. This one will hurt, but I don't own that much of it...."
GAAP loss ($0.75) - the extremely high PE stocks are vulnerable - only a 15% grower - hard to value.
This is likely funds unloading positions to lock in profits before mid term election and macroeconomic uncertainty. What has changed in PANW since it's last quarter blockbuster earnings report? Nothing fundamental has changed IMO.
Just bought in hoping I not too late and this company growth continues up over the next 2 to 3 years.
"You just have to buy on the dips and have the stomach to plat the game!! I am in at 181.35 with $100,000. Already making money by the time the market opens tomorrow."
Will PANW stock go up after ER? Thumps up for UP and Thumps down for LOWER price! Thanks in advance!
"Three price target raises today:Palo Alto Networks price target raised to $295 from $255 at Monness CrespiPalo Alto Networks price target raised to $300 from $265 at Mizuho, BUYPalo Alto Networks price target raised to $300 from $260 at BMO Capital"
Hopefully we hit 210 by earnings!
Congrats Longs! Have one my behalf tonight :)cheers
Great company to keep buying!
"very interesting to see how panw hold on a down-day. same strategy spending huge amount of money to fund or buy the growth. this strategy works only short term and selective. panw gets addicted with this trategy in combining buying growth to show high growth rate. will see how this holds. when the pumpers release their valves, we should see free fall. happy trading and good luck to all."
"I like the trading set up as well. In at $141.21 today. May add if pulls back prior to earnings Monday at the close. Looking at chart, this may see a nice gap up with good earnings. In for the trade. Next will be CRM - Salesforce."
Didn’t they beat and raise guidance? This has to be a “ sell the news” situation with the recent run up
"Holding 205, could see 215 in a few days and then holding 210-212. Not looking back"
Wonder if Marriott has PANW firewall equipment?
what is happening? why down after market? look at WDAY and SPLK.
This is getting close to where it was 5 YEARS ago!
" This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
It's up 25% in a week. Not performing that well IRL. Selling starts today
Another winner!
"I am looking at the 3 year chart right now and you can see the set up for earnings based on the last two times they announced. If good, this pops heading to $160."
The greatest short opportunity of 2018!
Predicting quarter over quarter revenue and earnings decline next Q(not to mention another GAAP loss) and the stock is up 9%. Makes sense.
Guess the ceo can’t bull his way through this quarter on the call.
Wasn't Nikesh Arora fired by Softbank's Masayoshi-san for double-dealing/fraud to benefit himself first instead of Softbank ?
"How can this company is still loosing money? They were (now everybody followed) disruptive with the whole appID, replaced half of the fw on earth and r clear leader in gartner. what more needs to happen so they actually have profit? I am looking at the fortinet and they have huge net margin. Whats wrong with PAN?"
I'm in for a call trade. Expect earnings to be decent with an inline to slightly positive guide. Stock will hopefully pop back to $150. I think CY'18 will be a breakout year for PANW. Their OS 8 products are hitting their stride and customers are starting to buy-in to the platform play. Will take proceeds from earnings trade and go long for next year. GL to all.
"Of the 37 analysts who cover Palo Alto Networks, 31 have buy ratings, five have hold ratings, and one has a sell rating. Of those, 16 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock Thursday, while two raised theirs, resulting in an average price target of $267.91, according to FactSet data."
$460 tomorrow. Keep trying to short it people.
"My assessment of yesterday's earnings report: Positives: Revenue beat, ability to give company guidance for next quarter, guidance fairly good given pandemic uncertainty, more than 1500 customers currently doing free trials or POCs. Tons of analyst community price target increases this morning.Negatives: Per share metrics were better than expected due to share float being reduced by about 1.6% this quarter. Unclear to me how they did this, was it via share buy back? Subscription revs were a bit disappointing when I was expecting a HR due to the pandemic."
"IF WE GET A NICE PULLBACK, THEN BE READY TO LOAD UP ON THOSE OCTOBER 15th CALLS CHEAPER, THEN RIDE IT BACK UP. IN MY OPINION "
"IF CMG CAN GO UP TO $2,000 FROM SELLING MEXICAN FOOD,PANW SHOULD BE AT LEAST WORTH $600s-$800s with PROTECTING PERSONAL/FINANCIAL DATA IMO. "
"This stock is going to $494. Best Security in the Industry, Many more enterprise clients to be added now. AND:Potential buyers are knocking on their door."
WARNING PANW LONGS!! The shot has been fired over the bow! Your overvalued whares will get a 50% gap down as CRWD and ZS rapidly take your business. CRWD has signed up 50 % of its customers since 2/1/19 and you'd best sell your shares to some unspespecting trader before it is too late!
I told last week that the chart shows it bottomed out...and poised for run-up
Just keep buying it because market never comes down
Sold half of my position last night. Will sell the rest today. This will be $200 very soon.
"CRWD sold after hour, it might impact sentiment for all cybersecurity including PANW, FEYE, ZS, OKTA and many more"
Does anyone else see a cup and handle forming in this chart? It also seems to be a triple top.Looks strongly to me if it pushes above $250 it’s moving up a lot higher.
what is going on? down so much from open
Keep playing the golden rule!!!!
Great company and space - Long and staying that way.
This will open at 165 tomorrow
Congra to all longs. Happy trading and good luck to all.
"This is about as brilliant as an earnings report you can get! PANW is headed to all time highs, and probably will be kissing 200 very soon"
why the fall ??
Pretty sure they always include guidance in the release - not there this time.
"The thesis for investing in Cybersecurity has not changed.The recent sell-off in Tech stocks is due solely due to interest rate fears. The market as usual overreacted. This presents an opportunity. The thesis for investing in Cybersecurity has not changed and Palo Alto remains one of the most financially sound companies in this space. PANW is now trading 14% lower than it was in January. We are buyers at this level. Despite all the warnings and high-profile breaches, that state of readiness for most when it comes to cybersecurity is dismal. In our ever-increasing digitalized world of cybersecurity, threats keep growing. Nearly 80% of senior IT and IT security leaders believe their organizations lack sufficient protection against cyberattacks despite increased IT security investments made in 2020 to deal with distributed IT and work-from-home challenges, according to a new IDG Research Services survey commissioned by Insight Enterprises. The Cybersecurity Market is Forecasted To Be Worth $403B by 2027. Palo Alto Networks reported solid F2Q21 results by beating estimates on all metrics and provided guidance ahead of consensus estimates. Total revenue was $1,017 million and was ahead of the consensus estimate of $986 million, driven by solid momentum in its cloud business. EPS was $1.55 and beat the consensus estimate of $1.43, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage. We feel that the stock sell-off since the report is a good buying opportunity that won't last. As always do your due diligence and be careful out there. Best of fortune to all"
$PANW Who thinks this will open in red tomorrow morning in extended hours trading?
Strong report with guidance. $255 within next two weeks
"We keep winning awards in the industry but we are not moving. $PANW earnings today should boost us, I hope."
panw has trouble to hold due to over-bought. will drop like a rock tomorrow if the market neutral or down. good luck and happy to all.
Watch how it drops so quick
He's talking about 3 speedboats now...why are they buying speedboats?
Do you think PANW stock will go higher tomorrow post ER? Thumps up for UP and thumps down for DOWN trend.
earnings per adjusted share....so not GAAP
"Sold Short a lot of shares of PANW a few hours ago, at $342.18 average price. So far in the AH session the stock has been acting perky on a better than expected earnings report. But my plan is to stay short at least until tomorrow afternoon. So often these perky AH or PM moves collapse and turn Red once the regular market session gets underway. I will be running this one with a 10% Bracketed, Conditional OCO Buy Cover order. Giving myself a chance to get big profit if she collapses tomorrow, while at the same time trying to limit my loss to a very manageable 10% in case the upside trend continues and intensifies. Good Luck! :-)"
"I thought I would buy some at this level but, WOW forward guidance was really bad!! This is not going away for a long time.I will not be interested with this bad guidance! Folks that bought at $240 are going to be waiting a long time for even!"
"wow, real impressive earnings beat, guidance was good tooThis might keep the market up big tomorrow"
Never buy stocks during earnings day … will end up in big RED!
Hey j
"cyber-security chkp does not look good, the current earnings for the quarter is ok but will get a big haircut. all have to do with future prospect. panw is valued for many yrs out with ultra growth ... anything short of this will have a HUGE haircut regardless the current quarter. panw is a shell company... does not have an eco system to build on and if big players incorporate this layer, it will drop like a rock. now csco, ibm, and others pay attentions more at this sector and this can slow or even take market shares from panw. take your profit and run before it is too late. happy trading and good luck to all."

"Phillip is right. I think there will be a run up right before the close though, and you'll see the spread widen so the MMs can make their money that way."
Still can’t believe this hasn’t taking a dip since skyrocketing. Steady incremental climb each day since. No shorts here?
In at $188 (500 shares).
I heard on the news the new CEO but back 6 million shares today.

Amazing company. Revenue up 170 million and still can't make money.
"Protecting online assets will be more in demand going forward, Cybersecurity stocks like PANW will be going to the moon!!! "
"It rallies to resistance, and it falls. It falls to support, and then it rises. PANW is nothing more than a trading stock. Since they warned for the next few quarters, I have to believe the macro trend of the stock is still to the downside. Today appears to be a short covering rally, albeit on a down market day."
"My neighbor is an admin for one of the executive, she's scheduled meeting between Morgan and IBM. I wondering if they are looking to sell or a partnership."
How they got this up $35 from $180 is hard to believe based on the conference call I just read. GAAP has to be negative next year and doubt it will be much better in the couple of years after. He's talking about $4 billion free cash flow over the next 3 years but that's mostly share compensation. That means market cap goes up by a like amount.
It will be $180 tomorrow.
"What a few minutes to see where it settlesLooks positive right now, looks good"
"After hours,,,,, yikes"
$PANW is on volatility region. It will drop to a point which will force you to intact for a long long time. I would stay away from buying or even keeping my positions!
Just follow the accelerated trends....the more businesses shift to the cloud means more demand for premium cybersecurity.

"If PANW closes above 196.75 today, that means it broke above the top of the Ichimoku Cloud and sees no more resistance of any kind. Cool hit new all time high."
Palo Alto Networks is up 13.41% to 422.54
It’s going up tomorrow $235+
Bought some more
I saw the CEO's interview with Cramer. I like the idea of a one stop shop platform that integrated by PANW rather than leaving it to the customer's IT dept. It's a smart approach.
"Over the past year as the company has recovered from negative perceptions in 2017, Palo Alto Networks has emerged as one of the few SaaS companies that has a demonstrated ability to scale up to multi-billion dollar run rates while continuing to improve profitability. Of the companies that have reached this ~$ 3 billion revenue rung, very few have been able to maintain ~30% growth - and those that have, like Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), are rewarded by much higher multiples, typically a double-digit forward revenue valuation, than Palo Alto Networks. On that basis, alone, I believe Palo Alto Networks still has plenty of room to rise higher.I believe Palo Alto Networks to be worth at least 20x EV/FY19 FCF, which implies a price target of of $289 and 27% upside from current levels. Stay long on this name as it continues to execute on a rarefied growth story in a critical pr"
"since Feb 9, less than 2 weeks, panw up 17/share. the upgrade is not a strong upgrade, don't see much upside from here, but again you never know, retailed investors are moving in and could have short term spike. i am going to increase my short position if it stay at this level or up in the next 2 hrs. happy trading and good luck to all."
Stock in its way down huge sell off coming SELL
panw is way over value and is going to be adjusted to its fair value. glad was able to short again this morning rally. good luck to all and happy trading.
"I was an early Crowdstrike shareholder but sold out of my position because the stock got way too expensive and now I'm looking to get in Palo Alto. I'm willing to sacrifice the higher growth rate for a far better valued stock in a space that will see increased spending. I was wondering when to get into the stock, any ideas? I feel like the stock will go down the $335 level it tested January and if doesn't hold that then back down to the $290 level. I want to average in between those two prices, thoughts? Should I buy here at $350?"
BIG WIN!!!
how do you think about the earnings?
"I have March 15, $175 options to unload. Any idea how high this would go and recommendation on when to sell ?"
If this beats and has decent guidance it will go up $10-15 over the next couple weeks... however if this misses or has bad guidance it’s going to $180-190...
"At what point does PANW consider a split? 4:1?? 8:1?? Is a $50 stock more attractive to buyers with $2,000 or funds?"
"Well, MS price target $515. I´m buying..."
Why are we so negative
Where is this heading from 154? Time to get out or wait until end of week?

"Looks like that panw is setup for upward move and possible take off like it did the last 2 earnings reports. I like the setup ... it is like a compressed spring and once the constraint removed, we could see a very nice gaining. from the big picture, the long do have a decent edge at this level. happy trading and good luck to all."
Moving closer to profitability.. maybe some time in 2026?
$PANW never disappoints. Printing money up to and past earnings!!
Earnings confirmed? Sept 6th? AM or PM?
Seems like a bit of a overreaction for a company that beat expectations again and is only projecting lower 4q based on acquiring companies to better position themselves in the future
"time for new annual high, and then all time highs 200"
what's the reason today for erasing one month of gains?

Nice little move today. I am no idea what caused it
On the 14th analysts reiterated buys with price targets of as high as $180. Lets see if they raise the PT any higher.
"I do respect everyone's opinion here but I work in the same sector as this company and these guys are changing business model at the moment due to which they had revenue miss last time. Almost all the stocks these days are bloated so it's not only this one. But this company has right products and customers want them. Their debt/equity, current etc ratios are not too bad compared to some other super bloated stocks and in fact good if we factor in their recent acquisitions. I truly believe this will be back into 200-220 once the market is back so there is surely an upside here. I would have loved to by this stock in 150s but hey I can't put all the eggs in one basket as I do already own a lot of this company at just a bit higher price. All the best to all!"

"With earnings declining 10% YoY and revenue at a not-stellar +17% YoY, we better jump boat here and move to Zscaler. Their earnings are still growing while revenue is over +50% YoY. They are taking customers from PANW. I think we ran our course here and I prefer to take $220 other than watch it go down to $150 without doing anything."
Always a good day to pump up a Commie stock on the American Mao Stock Market. Security is solid these days. See T-Mobile.
I've owned this stock continously since the week of its IPO back in 2012. I just put an order in to sell at 240.50 I'm going all cash liqudating all stocks and will be on the sidelines for the next 2 months at least. I've sold stocks I've held for more than a decade. I have never shorted a stock and I've never bought a Put contract. I'm the pure definition of a long. I did not make this decision hastily. Good luck to everyone.

"While I'm not in favor of his happening, PANW looks to be right in Cisco's wheelhouse right now. About 2 years of Cisco's free cash flow is all it would take to have Palo Alto under their umbrella. I know there's been rumors like this for years, but now just seems more likely in my opinion. Only a small position in PANW at this point, but plan to buy more in the coming months and possibly years. Good luck PANW longs!"

PANW sold off after earnings for profit taking. Others sold it because they got scared and didn’t know what to do other than follow the crowd. Stock should be jumping back another 5-8% very short term.
Can’t stay above 400 to save its life
Are they showing Net profit? After so many years is the PE ratio at least 30? If not it is gas story.

Any weakness in the overall market and PANW drops by 75 points in a heartbeat and then it is still overvalued.Good product. Good company. Stock should trade between 55-65 until it can show significantly better revenue growth.
Ready for liftoff??
"i am not a cyber security investor. congradulations to you all who have been long haulers it has paid off. i have a question about these companies. if i pay these companies to protect my data, my info and also others who entrust me with their personal info, how does their stock rise when there firewall or security protecting you fails? the hackers break through their work and you have to pay millions for ransom and at the same time the security company u been paying lots of money to for protection, and failed, their stock rises. where we come from if your work fails or your job is not suitable and messes up, you pay for any damages until everything is back to normal and then you're fired. looks to me the security companys can have someone to hack systems that they made and stocks go up and collect ransom. it is win win for them. if u dont think so check the history of all hacks, the ransoms paid and how much stocks go up each time. if someone cleans your house everyday for 2 years and u come home and everything in your house has been stolen or broken to bits and pieces because u saw them do it on your camera are u going to invite them back with a big smile and give them a big raise? just wonderin"

"bad earning and outlook, I just short 200 shares."
I just bought before the close
tech market is vry bullish buy around $200 will keep going up. nothing stopping the trend now
Apparently a Crowdstrike insider just dumped like 9 mil of Crowdstrike. Wonder what's about to go down. Could be Palo Alto's gain after this chain of losses.
"Share prices are going up, they have invested in the purchasing of companies to expand and grow the services provided.

Will probably het a bounce based on the history of the stock after big drops... if u chart it we should get a 5-10 bounce over next few weeks.Of course if u owned before the drop that doesnt help much.RSI is 17 so big time oversold....if we can get a good market day should see a bounce.
"Oh man, what a spike today, I missed it :("
"CONGRATS TO THE DISCOUNT BUYERS ON THE OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLSNICE CONSISTENT BUYING CHEAPER ON WEAKNESS, FOR MASSIVE GAINS LATER "
Benzinga says there are rumors of take over. anybody heard this.
Analysts working overtime tonight to refactor their models and write upgrades for tomorrow before the open
Anybody hear the Google buyout rumor? Don't know if its true or not
The earnings wasn't THAT good! This thing is going to go down quickly with such a big gap and mediocre earnings. Way overbought...
Cramer said it’s good to take some of the table and reposition back later. Normal
the usual crew are bidding it up & cutting favors for each other!!!! you know how it works !!and they get GS & JPM to back them up for BS'ing on CNBC!!You know how it works...
There are so many better security companies to invest in than PAN. Growth is slowing not profitable...
be fearful when others are greedy
the forward earning estimate is lower than street estimate. revenue growth slowin. stock price need to adjust
BIG GUIDANCE MISS AS I PREDICTED. DOWN SHE BLOWS TO 200 LEVEL OR BELOW. GLAD I SHORTED TODAY AT THE HIGHS OF DAY @ 250.40 X 1000 SHARES. CONFERENCE CALL COULD GET THIS HAMMERED DOWN TOMORROW BIGTIME.
"My neighbor works at PANW and told me to load up huge with the stock before earning and I did not listen. I only listened until today after the big jump, but I do see this going to $200!"
Looks like they're in..............+$7.00 in AH
Earnings and revenues looks good. Any ideas what the stock will do tomorrow ? After hours seems to be a dud
"Consolidation at its best. PANW hits new high before and up to its last earnings, insiders and traders cash out make $$$ Stock drops, insiders and traders start to accumulate a position again at lower levels Before next earning stock hits 3HUNDY NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH THE CO THAT BROUGHT IT TO 272$ NO REASON FOR A DROP EXCEPT consolidation"
Too high valuation
"Buyers a fighting hard for this one. Even with two positive days in the market, this obviously isn’t gaining traction. Charts don’t lie trend is down. Next two days will be interesting."
awesome
"SLOWLY ACCUMULATE/BUY THOSE OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLS CHEAPER AS PANW TEMPORARY GOES LOWER, TO MAKE MASSIVE GAINS LATER. IN MY OPINION "
We did it! 160$ in the next few days
"Great Earnings report tonight, it will skyrocket just like $PANW"
"Based on PANW’s excessive legacy’s products and business and the stock chart, I am shorting this stock at the open. Apologies to all longs but wake up."
"PANW reaching $400 targets now. Deutsche Bank raised it to 490 yesterday, more will follow. Even if assuming 20% correction and lowered targets thereafter, is it worth holding after earnings?"
bulls should be buying this up below $200
nice
Pali alto. Administration charged with insider trading. This is not a surprise! This happens 100’s of times a day in the stock market. It’s just a matter of getting caught. And they got caught!!!
High demand business but stock looks overbought. I'd wait for a pull back.
following the ski slopes nice and slow.
Beautiful Quarter
"For now, it is not a bad idea to take some of the table after a few good runs and wait to access the situation after the earnings. the upside is limited at this point given the activity of the management. happy trading and good luck to all."
"Just wait until tomorrow. Once institutions can trade, this stock will hit $190/share."
"The stock beat on top line and bottom line; they're a VERY good company, expanding now via buying-up other web security companies. Their guidance was bad, so if the stock goes to $225.00 it would be a GREAT buying opportunity, long term."
Numbers look good to me. Can't resist this @ 175. My first position in a company I've been watching for a while. Today's news about the Marriott breach demonstrates once again that a security breach is a lot more costly than an investment in security.
Talk about over reaction
RJ increased target price to $258.
Why it fell so much?
can you milk a Cat?
"#PANW A break of 214.69 could move it up to 250.76 in short term. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
"there are no more RSI's or MCD or any technicals matter anymore, its the golden rule, He who holds gold rules!!!"
How is one executive worth $2 billion dollars in lost market capital?
"Did PANW buy back shares, I don't see it mentioned in the report. They show 96.7 million shares, in Q2 was 98.3 million. I went back through all reports, and this is the 1st time they ever decreased shares. Cash went down $500 million, so it would seem to point to share buybacks. Have they announced buyback funds in the past?"
THE DISCOUNT BUYING CONTINUES ON THE OCTOBER 15th & JANUARY 2022 CALLS.Get them as cheap as you can for massive gains later.
"Very interesting, panw announced its quarterly report date is shifting 9 days. Is this a sign that it needs to extend its number of day to make up the short fall of rev? don't know if this the case and if it is, eventually the sharp analysts will figure its out, and we could see a big hair cut. on the other hand if the everything is normal, we still should see a medium hair cut. current price has built in assuming that panw will have another blown out quarter, good growth, good rev, and good outlook. anything short of this, who know where this baby will be ... very normal we see 10-15% down from here. my probabilistic model suggests to sell at this level which is 160. this is what I have been doing, but I could be wrong. good luck to all and happy trading (of course this including me). cheers ... I want opposing views and want to see I am missing."
"On the hunt for my next Pure Earnings Short Sell play, I found three very promising candidates: PANW, ROST, and VFC. But which one is the most Bloated Baby of them all?? The answer is: PANW. Later tomorrow, after I Cover my MNRO Short Sell, I plan to throw all my hard cash into a Short Sell of PANW, ahead of her earnings release after market close tomorrow. I think PANW will sell off HARD right after her earnings release. What is bizarre is that multiple analysts are EXTREMELY bullish right now on PANW, predicting stock price jumps all the way to the $500 level! Well, I listen and follow only Myself, and here is what I see in PANW:1: Stock is significantly over-valued. 2: Company is not profitable. 3: PANW is accumulating debt at an unusually high rate. 4: Company has average to poor overall financials: Return On Equity is weak. EPS Growth Rate is downright bad. 5: Insider Selling is absolutely horrific. Insiders are DUMPING PANW. Not just one, but many. The Chief Technology Officer sold 12,000 shares on 4/8/21, another 12,000 shares on 3/2/21, another 12,000 shares on 2/1/21, another 12,000 shares on 1/4/21. Can anyone say No Confidence?? 6: If you analyze recent quarterly earnings reports, you will find something very interesting: PANW always beats consensus estimates on Revenue, but always misses consensus estimates on EPS. In fact, they have missed EPS consensus estimates for the past EIGHT consecutive quarters. I think right now, with tomorrow's earnings release, this stock will take a 5-12% hit to the downside based upon weak numbers that bring current over-valuation into clear and undeniable focus."
Puts!
Any projections for tomorrow?
that's 4 days in a row! Over a dozen brokers upping their price target. Nothing but good news today for Palo Alto!
"Is investing exciting or what? Does history repeat itself for panw? the last 2 earnings reports, panw were in light sold off mode and surged after earnings reports. I love building my position at this level on weakness. it is low risk to go long here provided we know panw has good growth and no warning issued at this point; therefore, the upside is huge and downside is limited. the edge is presented here, should I take it or could it be a falling knife. Here is what I am going to do, moderately accumulate today"
Up or down before ER? After ER?
"In the last 2 quarterly reports, panw went up about 17% and 11% respectively. Any weakness around this level is a good point to take close look or even initiate a position is not a bad idea."
"Congrats all longs. Next trade if you are a trader is Salesforce - CRM, Baozun- BZUN."
there will be a quick spike follwed by profit sales. i see it settling around 250 for few days.
I hope in 2021 we can get back to trading on financials and not emotions & news headlines.
Reports upbeat revenue guidance!
