"Avangrid earnings release contained this: ""The PNM Resources PNM deal of the utility is on track to be closed by the end of this year following its approval gain from the New Mexico regulatory commission."""
"I wonder why PNM, a successful utility being bought out by a bigger Avangrid for $50.30 in cash, not stock mind you, and distributing 33 cents/share before being sold is running quite below #50.30. Four out 5 regulatory bodies have approved the deal and the fifth one as far as I read doesn't seem to have any opposition. I would expect the stock right now be valued very close to the offered price. Any reason why not? Thanks."

Another divi- hope they don't get the deal done until Jan- make my taxes a lot easier. Looking @ $1.10 a share (@ $49.50)- easy money.
Is there an expected dividend coming before the merger with Avangrid is completed in the near future?
Free money right now with divi on Oct-30.
PNM Resources is up 9.05% to 49.88
PNM is down 4.97% to 46.31
"Hey, while we are just waiting for this stock to get kyped, does anyone know what the tax implications will be for long-term shareholders? Long term capital gain, qualified long term dividend, or some combination of those?I am weighing the possibility of selling before the payout in order to have 100 percent cap gain so it can be offset by the sale of another losing position.My basis is in the $4-5 range, so most of the payout will be gain."
PNM like watching paint dry
When the buy out Will be done?
Any thoughts on this week? Down ~$0.50 on no news. People throwing away free money? Were investors maybe expecting a sweetener to the deal?
Looks like all the ducks are in a line for a quick closing based upon arbitrage players. Approval probably by next week.
"Spike up at close friday. Meetings were supposed to held this week to finalize the deal but no announcements. Does anyone know anything at this time? It is strange to be in a position that I am okay if the deal goes thru but if it does not, I see this stock running to the $55-$60 after a short sell off down to around $45. Any opinions--There are a lot of good things happening in New Mexico, big migration of work at homers coming in. BREAKING GOOD."

"...an initial stipulation among parties was reached in April increasing and expanding commitments related to the net public benefit of the merger to over $272 million in PNM customer rate benefits and economic development contributions for the state, alongside enhanced environmental benefits, commitments to maintain local jobs, programs and charitable leadership and a number of additional commitments.
