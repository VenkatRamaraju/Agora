PNM is down 8.08% to 33.69
bought on todayâ€™s dip
Any thoughts on this week? Down ~$0.50 on no news. People throwing away free money? Were investors maybe expecting a sweetener to the deal?
PNM is up 4.93% to 49.40
"Spike up at close friday. Meetings were supposed to held this week to finalize the deal but no announcements. Does anyone know anything at this time? It is strange to be in a position that I am okay if the deal goes thru but if it does not, I see this stock running to the $55-$60 after a short sell off down to around $45. Any opinions--There are a lot of good things happening in New Mexico, big migration of work at homers coming in. BREAKING GOOD."
"PNM is reported with the wrong dividend paid on 1/19/17, it should be $0.2425 not $0.243. Thanks"

"Hey, while we are just waiting for this stock to get kyped, does anyone know what the tax implications will be for long-term shareholders? Long term capital gain, qualified long term dividend, or some combination of those?I am weighing the possibility of selling before the payout in order to have 100 percent cap gain so it can be offset by the sale of another losing position.My basis is in the $4-5 range, so most of the payout will be gain."

"I wonder why PNM, a successful utility being bought out by a bigger Avangrid for $50.30 in cash, not stock mind you, and distributing 33 cents/share before being sold is running quite below #50.30. Four out 5 regulatory bodies have approved the deal and the fifth one as far as I read doesn't seem to have any opposition. I would expect the stock right now be valued very close to the offered price. Any reason why not? Thanks."
