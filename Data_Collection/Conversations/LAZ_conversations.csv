Laz has exceeded EPS estimates for 9 consecutive quarters. Anyone have an intelligent idea why it continues to trade in the same price range with that performance history?
"I am sooo happy I bought this for $63!! 6.8 dividends for life!!!As soon as the deal closes early next year this will be an $85 stock, once all synergies are from the merger are in to play this will be $120!!!Cant believe the new comoany with $10.5 eps, is so cheap!Humira has another 4 good yearsin the USA, botox another 20 years in emerging market plus all new drugs!!! Also my other dividends stocks I just bought are:$LAZ $COTY $MOAll have easily 30% upside and 5.5% plus dividends"
"With the assumption a special dividend is coming, anyone got any feelings on the amount? A boost perhaps. I expect the regular dividend to remain the same for 1st quarter with an increase for the 2nd quarter. Any thoughts/insights? LAZ has been very good to me since I purchased in Oct16."
LAZ reached a new 52 Week Low at $39.29
Why doesn;t LAZ trade in pre market and after hours mrk?
Lazard is down 5.01% to 49.83
Got a positive mention on CNBC by some guest analyst. I already own STWD (pays 8.5%) recommended by Cramer. I am not sure about a company with HQ in Bermuda
"For you all that love dividends:$LAZ Lazard investment advisory has 6% dividend, P/E of $10 and very strong balance sheet. Yesterday It just announced it will be responsible for the Aramco IPO, that will bring huge revenues. The company is very shareholder friendly and always pay special dividends. My entry price was $32, i think It should easily reach $40 soon.$COTY the biggest Frangance/Cosmetic company in the world had tough times recent having to write off $3 billion from the acquisition of P&G products, but it has a new CEO with a turn around plan. It pays 5.45% dividend. The main reason I bought it its because insiders just bought $80 million worth of stock, yes that right $80 million with their own money. Also JAB one of the institutions share holder that had 32% stake, increased to 60%, maybe they will take private soon. I think most bad news are behind, and with Esteer Lauder beating earnings, COTY should follow it."
Looking for an entry for next leg up. Target: 66.54 at stoxline.
Lazard reached a 52 Week high at 51.93
Crushed earnings
"Wow fab earnings. Hope the ""Brain Boys"" aren't hoggish and declare a special divi as in the past."
Lazard is up 5.26% to 48.20
What's up? Actually not up. Down nearly 5% at this moment.
With stock prices at depressed levels M&A action should pick up. LAZ is a good buy right now.
LAZ reached a new 52 Week Low at $38.50
"Just bought LAZ yesterday with the hope that they would become a C corp. Does anyone know if they are considering the switch from a limited partnership soon? While waiting, a nice covered dividend. Bill"
Jan. AUM up 7.1%. Still no big interest in LAZ.Low volume = No price movement......
This gets bought out and pps does nothing?
I'm thinking the dividend looks safe based on their payout history/ratio. Does anybody have any thoughts on that?
I guess I am the only one who loves this stock but they had such a great quarter this stock will be slowly moving higher after this
Ex Div. on 2/14/19. Regular and extra paid this time......$.94 total.
"So, if coming out of this health/economic crisis there is a huge amount of M&A activity, I would imagine LAZ should do ok?"
"LAZ , a Take over target."
Hey PE boys look at SUP to buy out and go private for a flip later it's the perfect company with a real business and a real turnaround make your millions in fees and bonus
"This company’s price per share has been spiraling down (18 percent), since their last earnings report. What is management doing to turn things around? Do they even care? They all get big salaries and stock options."
"Huge aftermarket volume on Fri. 2/22. 463,302 shares????"
