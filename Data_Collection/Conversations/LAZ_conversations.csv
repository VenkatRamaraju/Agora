Crushed earnings
"With the assumption a special dividend is coming, anyone got any feelings on the amount? A boost perhaps. I expect the regular dividend to remain the same for 1st quarter with an increase for the 2nd quarter. Any thoughts/insights? LAZ has been very good to me since I purchased in Oct16."

What a disappointment this company is to shareholders. The CEO does not care. He is a Billionaire. Today they hired a specialist to defend against Activist shareholders who might force this company to make changes to benefit shareholders. Disgraceful.

"For you all that love dividends:$LAZ Lazard investment advisory has 6% dividend, P/E of $10 and very strong balance sheet. Yesterday It just announced it will be responsible for the Aramco IPO, that will bring huge revenues. The company is very shareholder friendly and always pay special dividends. My entry price was $32, i think It should easily reach $40 soon.$COTY the biggest Frangance/Cosmetic company in the world had tough times recent having to write off $3 billion from the acquisition of P&G products, but it has a new CEO with a turn around plan. It pays 5.45% dividend. The main reason I bought it its because insiders just bought $80 million worth of stock, yes that right $80 million with their own money. Also JAB one of the institutions share holder that had 32% stake, increased to 60%, maybe they will take private soon. I think most bad news are behind, and with Esteer Lauder beating earnings, COTY should follow it."
"This company’s price per share has been spiraling down (18 percent), since their last earnings report. What is management doing to turn things around? Do they even care? They all get big salaries and stock options."

Anyone know why the surge in volume and price?
I'm thinking the dividend looks safe based on their payout history/ratio. Does anybody have any thoughts on that?

Laz has exceeded EPS estimates for 9 consecutive quarters. Anyone have an intelligent idea why it continues to trade in the same price range with that performance history?
With stock prices at depressed levels M&A action should pick up. LAZ is a good buy right now.

"Just bought LAZ yesterday with the hope that they would become a C corp. Does anyone know if they are considering the switch from a limited partnership soon? While waiting, a nice covered dividend. Bill"
