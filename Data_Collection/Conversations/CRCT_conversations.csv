Great stock I love it
Fly me to the Moon Cri#$%$ I'm holding on tight to my little shares. Keep going up! $75.00 and beyond
15 million share lockup on 9/21
The train is going
"HARD...nice call on spce !!! you sold CRCT way too soon and pumped spce at the highs , CONGRATS!!"
"Green in a red day, good to see"
30% short
ETSY results will decide which way it will go before results? Fingers crossed
The perfect storm. A financial firm owns 30% of the shares and the short interest is high at 5 days to cover. If the earnings beat and they raise guidance we could see $10 bucks to the upside. Buying the $40 calls.
Must be the new floor.
"Damn Citadel trying to punk the weak hands, bunch of crooks… this will fly tomorrow, 42% growth & tenth consecutive net income quarter!"
$40 is next. Still undervalued!
At $36.40 right now keep pushing 
6M shorts .....Goldman and Morgan Stanley short 13M float...downgraded.. pumped to $35 shorted now heading to $20
WAAAAY OVERSOLD at this point!! NOTHING CHANGED since it was $38. Sellers will be sorry come next earnings.
"WOW, market down 800 pts and CRCT, holding its own!!!"
Numbers in?
https://discord.gg/Mu5HyTN
CRCT holders have been dancing on their own for a little too long now. So I'm expecting a huge uptick in conversation over Cricut after they blow out earnings expectations.
and morgan stanely downgrade this stock
Only thing in my portfolio keeping me in the green
might hit 40 today
Crct on sale!! Whoop whoop just added another lot!!
$48... EASY. Wait till next blowout quarter then we go even higher. Don't need memes when you got profits!
An Edward Jones Manager told me when hedge funds and WS firms want a stock they will intentionally drive the price down to buy it cheaper because they know it will grow.
I'll gladly take a 6% gain day. This stock seems to have legs and resiliency which I'm really excited about.
spce stock going back to earth now cricut is going to the moon
#$%$ is wrong with this market and investors? they had a good report yet it tanking down 18% shame.
"Holding 650 crt stocks, acquired some at $18 and now we are at $36, hopeful earning drive us up. I believe in this product and can’t wait to see what this company has in store. Let’s go!"
Buy now or be sorry when it reaches ATH by the end of the week earnings and breaks $50. You have been warned! Shorts will be squeezed!
buy ! buy !!
Do not panic.. Do not sell. This behavior is expected.Will finish day around 28.05 or a little higher and after hours up about .45
What's going on here? Somebody explain!
net income of 150m annual and mkt cap 9billion +. simply overpriced Good luck having to wait 60years plus to break even current mkt cap
Nobody knows what’s happening even these so called smart analysts?
$50 INEVITABLE!
why is abdiel capital trying so hard to keep this stock up? HMMMMMM?
LOL more insider buying today!! It's funny how lucky I feel to be in this stock at this time.
Huge insiders buying even @35
"Be smart. Sell everything and buy high quality defensive stocks. Kellogg's, Duke, Campbells, JNJ, Heinze, proctor and gamble. All with great dividends. Big slowdown is upon us and these stocks will be moving. If you are 40 or under, this is what you should be investing in. COMPOUNDED INTEREST. GL"
"My son recently purchased one... it broke, and was replaced very quickly. excellent customer service "
Lots of insiders are buying
Wait for secondary before buying.
This will hit $45 easily by next quarter. Just hold. Maybe a $100 in a few years if it continues to increase its subscription revenue.
Keep buying folks this is only the beginning of our run to $40.
"Stock manipulation, this will be back up in no time"
"Morgan Stanley filed an SC 13g today, meaning that they're buying a large number of shares. This is interesting because they were the same institution that downgraded the stock not too long ago. I think we're about to break out."
As a authorized cricut reseller all of their new products are always going on backorder the demand for their products is huge!!
"Added 5K this morning to my dependents acct , 25.40.Another year of collage room and board covered"
Noo I sold why is it up after hours!
The 10 year is pushing diving down. Growth stocks are gonna grow as there's rotating into tech and growth
This will go back up
I heard about CRCT the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
20% is better
Support around 24.5. Likely bounce
Zacks has $1.06 for earnings est. in 2022. Forward P/E is 32 if they meet est. Kind of low for a company growing earnings at 300%. CRCT can easily support of 50 forward P/E IMO. Price target $53 in the next 6 months based on meeting est. These are conservative numbers. GL
save me...
Which platform did you guys use to buy CRCT shares?
Just thought of something. I am a maker/crafter.Around this time of year is when people start buying there stuff to make Christmas items for their Fall and Winter shows.So next earnings should be great!!
"this stock is so undervalued and very very cheap with EPS 31 higher than most high tech stock, Value is what you get price is what you pay."
"Here since 20, here since the original maker..LETS GO! $$$"
They have multiple machines including a mug press.Walk through any Michaels or Joanns and you will see their full line.
I see $50.00 in the near distant future.
If only a quality stock like this could become a meme for once....
Still holding strong
Lets stay above 35 today
Lucky people getting it at this price!!
"Morgan Stanley Lowers Price Target to $29 From $40. Still only 37,000 in pre-market volume. A good buy today?"
"hold strong today, nothing to worry about"
Quit day trading and just go long for inevitable ATH.
I really think you are going to want in before earning.... a few analysts have given this some attention and stated it is overweight.
My wife's friend has one of their machines and it's amazing what it can do. I like the company and hope they do well. My main concern is after someone buys the machine is there enough consumables to keep money coming into the company? Are the newer machines enough of an upgrade for people to justify buying a new machine if they already have one?
Lock-in period already expired last week. Abdiel pretty much bought up whatever the insiders were selling.
"Cricut recently launched a new product called the ""BrightPad"" and it's getting great reviews. https://inspiration.cricut.com/brightpad-and-brightpad-go/"
at $25 per share P/E is still at 27 ... that seems OK but not for a declining future revenues. Expect this to dip below the IPO price of 18. There's more room to fall unfortunately
We are going back over $40. Get in NOW! I've been correct many times before with this stock.
"Highest volume ever, through the roof!!"
This is gg to be a $100 soon if its revenue growth is maintained.
"10% Owner Abdiel Capital Management, LLC bought 230,000 shares of CRCT on May 25th at $30.65 for a total purchase of $7,050,215!"
AND IT BEGINS
"Ridiculously oversold, huge buying opportunity!"
Correct me if I'm wrong but it that a Pennant forming on CRCT's chart? Higher lows and lower highs. Looks like it's going break around earnings next week. Looks good
this is a growth stock. typical correction. no worry. load up as long as you can. we will see us at 50 at end of the year again.
Revs up 42%
"According to the new article linked to by Yahoo Finance, Cricut is gonna pull a Peloton. Which means we are headed to $150 in the next year."
2480 shares long! Just a matter of time before $40.
Scaredy cat day traders don't realize how high this will pop after next earnings. Grow a pair and go long!
bought 25 shares today
insider selling
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"IPO was priced at $20, 24 cents earning per share first quarter alone. Assuming there is no growth in 2021, it will give $1 earning a year. That means P/E is 23. This is a value stock that is growing its revenue 120% annually. It's large percentage of growth is sale of accessories and subscriptions, so they are not one time purchase. Growth is sustainable. I challenge you to find a better value in the market, pick up some shares before it is widely known."
Any secondary?
expirations is coming in next month? Hold tight or not?
haha shorts start running
CRICUT = 8B MKT CAPYETI = 8B MKT CAP I PREFER BUYING YETI STOCK
I TOLD YOU GUYS!
"10% Owner Abdiel Management bought $2,035,264 worth of CRCT on June 16th at $33.53! They also bought $2,136,709 worth of CRCT on June 15th at $33.87, and they bought $1,563,298 worth of CRCT on June 14th at $33.26! Get your shares today while they are still cheap! Abdiel Management is probably scooping up shares for cheap as I type this!! We will be going back to $34 soon enough!"
Company beats earnings and everyone is trying to bash it lol
"No guidance for Q3 but I think the drop is from lower expectations from reopening and summer travel. With school being back in and delta variant, I think we will see a better Q4, not sure about Q3 yet but CRCT has a great product that we use all the time in my home. GLTA"
going to the moon
I wonder how it’ll go if they end up getting sued one day for enabling widespread copyright theft and it gets out that their own CEO is a member of a Facebook group run by a prominent influencer where people routinely trade tips on how to work around or simply disregard Cricut’s licensing guidelines.
Looks like we are going to go beyond $50 after the earnings 
Picking up steam
"Just saw an image with the CEO commenting ""so excited to be in Staples stores in the US."""
Extremely profitable business with great net profit margins and after another successful earnings this should explode
Paper cutting company. Come on. Year 1985 wants their company idea back.
"this is essentially a game of ""old maid"" the stock is going to drop big as it returns to where it should be valued. in the mean time, bankers, management, and others will try to keep this levitated so that they can sell to ignorant retail investors. this company has no business being public. as the pandemic winds down, their business will soften. in any event, the company has no business selling at these multiples. are you kidding me?"
Get in before we rocket
"As a Cricut user, I'm holding strong on to my shares. To the moon!"
Why -10% in pre-market? To go up higher?
"As most of you probably already know, we just recently started to trade options, and there's a lot of interest on the 40 dollar call."
"like i posted a few weeks back.......the consolidation is exactly what was taking place before the next leg up to 50.......HUGE sales increases, HUGE social media following....Huge insider/institutional buying.....and did i mention PROFITABLE. this is a no brainer!!! CONGRATS longs on a fantastic day"
I have seen their margins and I really think people are going to want to be in this stock for earnings. They have great margins and revenues
lucky i sold at 35 and 38! not worth 7b mkt cap
Hopefully this will close at $30 and above. Keep shooting for the moon
there's potentially 220 MILLION SHARES available for sale at some point but only about 21 million trade currently. lock-up expires later this month. nice little company in a fragmented industry. benefitted greatly from the pandemic.
"Can anyone explain to me why CRCT is doing so well? I'm bullish about the company, along with the upper level management but don't understand how the price has gone up 40% over the last 5 days."
"A lot of the lower cap stocks are on a down trend, but when the money circulates back into them this is going to rocket"
"Looking at the 1 yr chart, CRCT looks like its forming a bearish head & shoulder pattern. Mid $31's looks like a support line ( neck line ). If this holds and earnings support then we could see an uptick to retest highs in the coming weeks. If this breaks then I see a retest of low $30's or potentially $25's. I agree this is a great company. My wife owns their product lines. I like $25 - $30 entry area for long term hold."
"This is will be the REAL short squeeze stock, not AMC, mark my words!!"
Hi 
Finally guys we are getting some upwards movement :)
All I see is more buying opportunities
"Went long CRCT today. Took Peter Lynch's advice of listening to the wife when it comes to stock suggestions and after checking it out, I was impressed with the combination of growth, strong balance sheet, insider buying, AND a reasonable price"
Lol Rip Down 37% 
This company has no long term debt. What new company goes public without any long term debt? Stay long.
"great value stock, plan on holding to $50"
"CRCT was priced for perfection at 40 forward P/E. 300% GROWTH IN THE FIRST Q TO 42% IN THE SECOND Q. This is a big reason why it's down 20-30%. Now that future growth is slowing., the forward P/E must come down to about half of that which means the price will get cut in half. I would say a 20 P/E would now be fair value. So this is a 20 dollar stock now, IMO. Still a long term buy but will take time for it to rebound. I'M OUT. GOOD LUCK"
Morgan Stanley downgraded from Over-weight to Equal-weight and raised their target to $40 from $30. I guess you can call it a good downgrade.
When did crct get options? 
"I’m going to be vocal here because it is important to understand that Cricut is replacing print companies and small batch suppliers. Small businesses, like me, are phasing out professional print companies for branding, packaging, labels, tags, stickers, vinyl, iron on and more because Cricut does it all. Cards, jewelry making, key chains, acrylic, leather goods, masks etc. Cricut makes all of these products. Most products sold in marketplaces nowadays are 1) drop shipped 2) Print on demand or 3) cricut made. Almost all stickers on Etsy are Cricut made."
looks like 15million shares come off of lockup midmonth sept.
We should be over $40 any day now.
I picked up some more shares on this little dip. I just don't think we are going back to that $33-$34 level anymore. Too close to earnings. Big jump soon.
undervalued like crazy
"Surprise jump in retail sales equals more Cricut sales AND more sales of things people create with Cri#$%$ It's gonna be another blowout quarter, get it NOW before $50!"
Feeling hesitant because it is quite overvalued..
Paper cutting company… come on this is just a fade.
"This stock will behave like a tentative thief for the next day or so. It was too easy to steal a quick profit. Now they are back getting a feel for the target again. Be careful on this today.Prediction is it will be up today.. however, no killing to be made here today."
This will be near 100 by next year
Market manipulation at its finest
Abdiel is seeing this as a buying opportunity
Implied outstanding 222 mill while outstanding only 15 mill? What??
Do not panic sell this will go back up
"What happens if it doesn't go back down, better buy in now while it's in the low 40's"
"I think the fair long term price is at least $70. The machines are one thing but it's the subs that will be the cash cow and most hardware vendors have no subscription revenue. There is an army of crafters out there. I see this thing selling more units than Xbox eventually and just likes Xbox, subscriptions are a huge part of the revenue stream. Also not to be a pessimist, but renewed pandemic fears will drive this stock higher because one of the main analyst concerns for this stock (stupidly so) was Covid going away."
#$%$ is going on AH?!?
the insider/institutional buying in crct has been insane.....the smart money knowns this is headed higher....MUCH HIGHER
INSIDER BUYING ALERT for CRCT!!!
keep going up
OMGOSH!!!
"Why in the first place did it plummet? They beat earnings, had good volume, I was shocked, and stilll am a little confused?"
$CRCT   at this level. Blink your eyes and this will be $45
"So this is the feed supply to the likes of ETSY, and neighborhood rummage sales. Because Americans need more T-shirts and custom coffee mugs!Name change to....HairCut ?"
"Has anyone ever had an experience with this company's products? The stock looks attractive but if you look up Ashish Arora, its CEO and whose name is showing up under insider trades, the name is associated with lots of fraud. I will always do a quick Google search of the insiders' names that are buying stock, especially looking for any type of securities-related fraud."
Get bent CRCT holders
most on wall street have NO IDEA about this stock or the enormous potential.......................shhhhhhhhhh i have been accumulating over the past 3 weeks.....please do not let the cat out of the bag until i finish by spending spree on this baby.......give it 2 more weeks and i will be all in. MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY that hardly no one knows about.....won't be a secret for long
is earnings now?
A little draw back last couple hours but were still up 6% today!
I see 2 weeks ago some of you laughed at me for dumping CRCT too soon to go to SPCE. Well I'm back from SPCE having lost almost all my CRCT profits. Bought 1895 CRCT shares today and staying in past 40 this time. :)
Rotation coming
One of the few stocks to end positive today.
oh my god ... hell.. help me
"More inside buying--July 8th 2021...Abdiel Capital Management took advantage of the dip. Bought another 121,000 shares worth over 4 MILLION."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Cricut is up 14.14% to 45.69
It was just at $33? What’s up! I also heard that it’s being shorted this true?
"Looks like they are trying to give us another chance to add soon., and I will if it gets in the low 33's. GL"
Big boys taking down ABDIEL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC7M float left short should be squize to $500
INSIDER BUY ALERT for CRCT!!!
"trampolining right now , but soon enough it will bounce to the 40 's"
I see CRCT retracing to the low 20's and then rebounding beyond 25.
Let’s go!!!!
Here come the quick sells. Hold on
Omg I’m about to panic sell. 25% pre market. What a disaster.
Simply basing and consolidating before the next leg up to 50…… this is one of the most undiscovered undervalued stocks out there
any news or just a pump?
Bought 250 more shares
Not sure why the stock is selling down after earnings beat - but i am sucking up shares.
Lots of manipulation today on this one.
very cheap strong buy
Give up CRCT holders
This will go be back in the 40's in no time
nothing in bad in the earning report to justify this selloff/manipulation such a shame
"Forward PE in the 20s, growth still greater than 40% annualized during a quarter that faced strong negative secular headwinds (re: end lockdown, fewer homeschool families, etc.), and this is getting pummeled because it wasn't good enough? lol, what a gift.Compare Cricut's second quarter with Pinterest's. Pinterest showed a disturbing decline in users, citing difficult comparable to 2020. Pinterest rightfully got trounced - bad quarter and significant earnings premium. Cricut still grew handily and short-term investors are more concerned with utilization rates? phbbt, give me a break!"
Only up from here
Are we going to hit 30$ today?
Guess some analysts were WRONG!!
What a nice thing to wake up to!!
More massive insider buys above the current price today. All we have to do is HOLD!
"Should you hold Cricut, Inc. (CRCT) Stock Now? Source: http://snd.qlitrk.com/r/ymzbs"
what happend???
"Better buy when it's in the low 30's , blink your eyes it's going to be at 50,75,100 just like that."
it’s coming !!!!
"@ Sherman Yes, INSIDERS bought CRCT for 3 straight days ABOVE the current price!"
30 today?
"Etsy with a major bump back to normal levels, get ready to see the aftershock hit this stock."
"Anyone who knows cricut is not surprised we beat earnings yet again. Cricut Q1 EPS $0.24 Beats $0.21 Estimate, Sales $323.80M Beat $294.13M Estimate"
"We have been holding the line tight, definitely keeping a steady pace"
.22 cents- 334.5 beat on both ends
Anyone here??
so heard the conference call the only guy who was trying hard to answer was the CEO him self other colleague does not have any motivation to answer the question!
Added at $32.79. We've seen this before.
"I'm into this one, almost 1billion dollars revenue"
33 Forward P/E for a company growing Earnings at 200% seems quite low. CRCT could easily see a 70 forward P/E. This is calculated with low EST. Easily double from here in the next 12 months. Add if you can. I did. Good luck
this will go to 100 by the year end.valuation will be just 8 times the 22 sales
Beat eps only 2% no good
Give up CRCT holders. Sell your shares.
Actually let this go down another 10 dollars I would love to buy more 
i see 60 in few weeks
Over 42 hopefully we keep pushing let's get to 44 today
staying in for the long term
what happend?
Shorting
Nice to see were holding steady at 40
"it does not matter whether ms or gs downgrade, somebody should downgrade gss,jpm etc they manipulate on behalf of their clients amd also do this to buy shares. its a growing company hold on , its shorts who are trying to do this"
u guys say oh institution are buying heavy now look what happen when institutional investor step in they can dump easily and drop the price. its not good for retail investor when Abdiel own 30% of this company ownership! it will be same like corsair playing and will be manupulating this stock !
$33.03 before earnings in two days? Is this a gift?
https://discord.gg/4KnkbBG
I said it before...money machine!!!!.. I would never of known about CRCT had I not own the Air 2...love this company
"Very interesting to look at their revenue composition on gross vs net sales...Machine, Subscription, & Accessories on gross sales it looks like business is mainly driven by machine sales, basically in this same order. However, Net Sales tell another story - Its Accessories!!! Subscription then Machines. My point is....Continue to increase the accessory options and $ ARPU of the accessories business"
"Wow, 28% of the float is short."
very cheap
"Cricut ( CRCT) is another name I love, but get frustrated no options market exists yet. The name received some looks during COVID as a possible at-home play, but I see it more similar to Etsy ( ETSY) over the longer term, rather than just another at-home play."
"A perfect storm for a break-out. We have a lessening short volume ratio, massive insider buying, and earnings coming up."
"WOW, what's going on??I like it!!!"
Huge hedge fund buying. 13G filled
"I can tell you cricuts biggest downfall as a vinyl reseller.There vinyl is x3 the price of other brands, if they could find a way to make it competing this would be huge."
Abdiel = Bagholder
This could be worth 90$ by years end
might be time to block bob
This hits $50 and never looks back after next earnings.
"looks like there are over 200 million shares outstanding but only about 20 million trade which allows various entities to more or less manipulate the stock price. lets see what happens when the first guys start to run for the gate.................................IMHO, the stock is going down appreciably."
Funny the people in and out of stocks. It’s like they have the attention span of a gnat. Hoping in and out trying to time every move is the number one way to get crushed. This is a great company. Dollar cost averaging is the best way to play it.
Their own VP of Accounting bought 72k shares on Friday. Hahaha.
"There was an investor conf, 3 days ago."
are we hitting 50 today ?????
Seems like no one knows what’s happening including these smart analyst!
this stock is the reason why i now pay attention to the short interest in a stock. Without reddit the hedgefunds will always win
Volume today at record pace so far. Can it keep up? 2.6 million is record.
Pretty good earnings! Membership rev up 110 % ! all I see are positives
Staying pretty steady
This stock is just awesome! But havent bought enough!
Amazing buying opportunity here!
Love to see the people trying to bash the stock  I’ll remember y’all when it goes back up
Are you Ready to ROCK the Stock Market?!? | www.StockRockandRoll.com
"I'm sure some of you know me from Webull. I began telling yall 3 days ago, without any previous bearish statements, to take profits and LIQUIDATE. nobody listened. When options become available this stock will get punished to at least 25, probably lower. You will NOT see 44 again before you see 25. Plain and simple."
Get in NOW before August 12th earnings POP!
"yes, that's right.... I am calling a 28-30% decline- at least- before you ever see $44 again. Do not question me. Listen. Or suffer."
Will drop as fast!
does anyone know how many shares are coming off of lockup this month?
Massive insider buying
"this is just a craftstore formerly known as provo craft and novelty. should be selling at 20% of sales . changed name, benefited from the shutdown, and now sells at 5 times sales. is this a great country or what?"
buy!!!! you must buy !!! very cheap!!! i am sure of this!!!!!
Come on day traders! You know this is going to $50+! Just hold and quit giving me heartburn! LOL
Why so much down on good numbers?....
"customers are using their products less and less so analysts have been downgrading the stock. it's easy to manipulate the stock since the float is currently small but have no doubts, the stock will eventually go down once the game playing is over. at the end of the day you are still PROVO ARTS AND CRAFTS"
