Well, ASCO guidelines suggest 20% relative improvement in median OS, so I'm guessing a preponderance of doctors. Referring back to the symposium, when asked by Dr. Stergiou to talk about his confidence in the GPS data, Dr. Moshe Yair Levy, Director of Hematologic Malignancies at Baylor University Medical Center and member of the REGAL Phase III Steering Committee, said this:Ask yourself, what are the odds that REGAL data suddenly do a 180 to negate 300%? Nope.--Jennx6 Bullish 9/10/21 Great Post Had to REUPCantor Fitz projects Revenue of $200M in 2023:In june the Ceo stated clearly FDA approval at Interim in First half of 2022 - now is the time to get loaded.

"What do you think the share price will be when the data becomes imminent?What will it be when the data is released? $80, 120 per share or more is easily doable, $jazz bough $CPXX for 1.5b ($90per SLS Share) when it Published its p3 results.-It also helps SLS is in the best financial condition ever in co history, 2 years of cash, $200m in license rev funding operations, and 4 more additional Catalysts over the next 75 days, SLS could easily double or quintuple in this time.Fda Approval is a virtual certainty. Listen to the Webcast GPs symposium on the sellas site. At the 1:05 mark dr Levy lays it out. Gps is a virtual lock. GPs extended survival in every single previous trial including both Gps AML Phase 2 trials at MSK and the Moffit center."

That is only a $2.8B Market Cap - Low float baby bios Do Grow Up. $jazz paid $1.5B for the last Drug that treats AML Cr2, like the patients in the GPS P3 approaching FDA Approval. Gps also treats the CR1 patients, 5x the number in Cr2. Gps is undervalued. Listen to Dr Levy's remarks, The Director of Hematologic Research at Baylor essentially just said GPs Approval is a Lock.
