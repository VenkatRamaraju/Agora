"Great company to buy shares from, they continue to overcharge customers, raise fees constantly, they make money buy constantly raising fees, that's it! Most dealers hate the company and their tactics, the company has a monopoly on selling junk cars along with COPART, they do the same, RIPPOFF of customers."
