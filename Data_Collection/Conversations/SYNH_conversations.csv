Look at the 4 day down candlesticks....VERY BULLISH!!
Does this company EVER have good news to release??
If you put conservative growth into the forecast say it can do 0.8c a QTR which I think is achievable with all the biotech activity going on the valuation would be much higher! 3.2 EPS * 20 PE = $64 which is almost double its current price. I think people saw the merger related expenses heard they'd taken a small hit to quarterly earnings with loss of a couple of jobs and panicked. Its crazy as the company is strong and way undervalued next to competitors. You can double your money in this stock in a month or two.
Will we have positive earnings tomorrow ?
Stock moving higher as Pharma investors realise value here. 54c earnings in last quarter which itself was subject to a blip due to loss of projects. Do some simple calc. to get an idea of value. EPS = 0.54 * 4 = 2.16. Earnings in 5 years with growth rate of just 10% a year (v conservative for this sector) = 2.16 * 1.61 = 3.47. Apply a reasonable PE for US stocks say 20. 3.47 * 20 = $69.5. So Id say this stock is worth around 70 bucks easy. I think it will grow faster though as biotech outsource more and more to these players. It could actually be a multiple of that valuation. For once there is great value baked into a Pharma stock in the nasdaq. This event last week actually knocked the stock back so you are buying something worth $1 for 50c.
Did they change name? Saying non tradable ? Any signs of BK ?
15% down on NO news -- What kind of company does that?
Where's the bottom with this thing? we're down 40% in 4 days!!
"Hey, Does anyone know why SYNH is down almost 7% today? Doesn't seen like there is any negative news."
Low volume drop this morning...stock has a huge gap to fill from $57
Institutions and Hedgies rolling into INCR.....should go to $45-48 in short term..if they release some news it could pop back above $50
finally some buying.....this stock should never have dropped below $45
starting in today at $35.
SYNH is up 21.79% to 43.60
NYSE...sorry for the comment earlier...I'm REALLY stressed on this stock! To fall from $57 to $34.50 in 4 days is just unbelievable!!
We need some news.
Nice volume again....and pretty decent move up....got a feeling news is coming.
I suppose market believe that no big worries about situation in Syneos. Maybe it is something related with old things happened year before?
today will be a good day
someone is building a large position in INCR.
