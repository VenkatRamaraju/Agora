Syneos Health is down 5.07% to 62.32
What a news? I missed something?
Syneos Health is down 4.92% to 53.17
starting in today at $35.
If you put conservative growth into the forecast say it can do 0.8c a QTR which I think is achievable with all the biotech activity going on the valuation would be much higher! 3.2 EPS * 20 PE = $64 which is almost double its current price. I think people saw the merger related expenses heard they'd taken a small hit to quarterly earnings with loss of a couple of jobs and panicked. Its crazy as the company is strong and way undervalued next to competitors. You can double your money in this stock in a month or two.
Is the stock halted this morning?
We need some news from the company to get us a little wind in our sails.....need to get above $40
So the price target downgrade this morning is what whacked the stock today from what I see. 3 analysts in last 3 days have lowered 12 month price target to mid $40's....analysts are such worms...

Stock moving higher as Pharma investors realise value here. 54c earnings in last quarter which itself was subject to a blip due to loss of projects. Do some simple calc. to get an idea of value. EPS = 0.54 * 4 = 2.16. Earnings in 5 years with growth rate of just 10% a year (v conservative for this sector) = 2.16 * 1.61 = 3.47. Apply a reasonable PE for US stocks say 20. 3.47 * 20 = $69.5. So Id say this stock is worth around 70 bucks easy. I think it will grow faster though as biotech outsource more and more to these players. It could actually be a multiple of that valuation. For once there is great value baked into a Pharma stock in the nasdaq. This event last week actually knocked the stock back so you are buying something worth $1 for 50c.
I suppose market believe that no big worries about situation in Syneos. Maybe it is something related with old things happened year before?
Stock did bounce off bottom Friday which is good sign...should move up on Monday...selloff over done but Wall street tends to overdo things...Stock should settle in around $44-$46 over the next couple of weeks...possibly higher

"""CEO Alistair Macdonald stated that the combined company expects strong performance of its commercial segment moving forward.“In the clinical segment, our momentum continues with another strong quarter of net awards, illustrating our ability to leverage our complementary customer bases, delivery platforms, and market approaches,” he said. “While our commercial segment performance was lower than expected, over time we expect this to improve with potentially more quarterly variability than our CRO business. Specifically, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our long-term Commercial growth through our market leading offering in an improving sales environment stemming from increased drug approvals and related new drug launches and expectations that this trend will continue over the near and mid-term.”"

"The stock is ridiculously cheap now. Even with 0 growth factored in, they did 52c in a terrible Qtr (excluding one time costs). Even if you factor in no growth going forward you can do a simple valuation of 2.08 (EPS) * 20 PE = $41.6 which is 20% higher than current PX! However, the company is the second largest player in the Pharma outsourcing space!"
