"wow, good movement today, only apparent news is Aslett being rates a top CEO during COVID. seems like this news is disconnected a little from the movement. (Nasdaq down 1.4% MRCY up 6.7%). Holding Long love the movement!"
In negotiations to acquire Themis Computer. Market likes it.
"Someone posted that MRCY is an earnings play. That poster apparently knows nothing about MRCY's business. MRCY is a LT national defense play, with most their sales going into programs that have a life span of 10, 20, or more years. I have been thru these sell offs before. MRCY went from 50+ to 33 in 2018, at that time they had some EPS issues. That just creates a buying opp, because the nature of their business will eventually resurrect the stock price. 33 to 85 in 18 months? that calls for a sell off. imo, buying now and holding for another 18 months will get you 100++, market conditions permitting."
I’m in at 71.60. Long play.

What is happening here
So clearly market over reacted to an otherwise string quarter. Guidance was lowered marginally but still represents growth. No reason to be trading at a 12 month low.
Great defense stock.Upgrade today too.

"This Company is aligned perfectly to advance, make money off of other larger entities. I'm so comfortable with this stock I purchased another 5000 shares today. I'm in for the long run with this company..."
Mercury is looking great to me in terms of dividend portfolio in non-tech. I bought some more share tdy and I hope it would be great in the end
It missed EPS estimates. $.28 vs. .30. Revs beat suggesting margins have declined. The revs forecast is below the street...very bad. It's going to be painful...@#$%#.
I guess I got doomed...... like someone said massive dumping at the last hour. not a good news for tomorrow. Will go down $3-4 more

Has management said why they are raising funds?
Super buy. I'm in.
Holding up well given the ER results.

"Nothing but spam on a MB for a stock that has been absolutely bullet proof. If you don't understand what they do, and how their business model works, you can easily get scared out of your stock.I have kept a small core position after riding it from 28 to 38, and have traded a lot of shrs 3 or 4 times between under-38 to about 39.Waiting for the next drop now...and I will double up on my core position."

"If premarket price rolls into the open, I will be a buying!"
"MRCY sells off 2 bucks in the opening hour, then recovers half of that in the next 45 min. This kind of volatility is reflective of shorts, esp naked shorting. With a low vol stk like MRCY, naked shorting can be brutal. Plus, all this selling started when they got moved to the mid cap index, which is usually a positive thing. If you know what they do, their business is very ling life cycle, the stock shd be very stable. This volatility is not reflective of their business, unless something has changed and that change is not public knowledge. I've been in MRCY since 30, and sell offs are to be expected, but this is ridiculous."
no worries here let the news digest. the earnings sound pretty awesome.
Company is receiving a lot of negative press.

record quarter all around!
surprised there r so many shorts in this stock. its low beta is not on their side.
What did I miss?
WHY IS IT DOWN?
great balance sheet+ no dividend -
ER was not bad. All is OK. Short term stall like last quarter. Hi PE stocks do this when the co doesn't guidance. Put it away and check in 3-4 months. This is a buyout candidate and you don't want to miss the action.

Rare buying opportunity.
"05:33 PM EDT, 08/01/2017 (MT Newswires) -- Mercury Systems Inc (MRCY) on Tuesday posted Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.32, up from $0.29 a year earlier, exceeding Capital IQ's poll estimate of $0.29. Still, its shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading after the company issued EPS guidance for the first quarter and 2018 fiscal year that came in below market expectations.Revenues rose to $115.6 million from $85.4 million a year ago, meeting market expectations.For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company forecast revenues to be in the range of $102 million to $107 million and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 per share. That compared with market expectations of $104.1 million for revenue and $0.28 for EPS.For the full fiscal year 2018, Mercury expects revenue of $453.0 million to $468.0 million, and adjusted EPS to be $1.15 to $1.23 per share. Analysts have been expecting revenue of $460.9 million for revenue and $1.28 for EPS.Price: 41.25, Change: -2.85, Percent Change: -6.46http://www.mtnewswires.com Copyright  2017 MT Newswires.
