So clearly market over reacted to an otherwise string quarter. Guidance was lowered marginally but still represents growth. No reason to be trading at a 12 month low.
no worries here let the news digest. the earnings sound pretty awesome.
Way oversold!! :)
"I guess everyone was spooked by the Raytheon pushback of their program fro FY22 to 23, I put all my cash to use here. I think that is overkill"
Spruce capital really blew there call here around 5 months ago. Strong sell. What a scam. doubled since then !
"Just a matter of time before investors buy quality growth stocks like MRCY and bail on momentum stocks whose business models they barely understand. Don't let the chart guide your decision - that's a useless, backward looking metric. Even AMZN went sideways for extended periods of time before advancing to record highs"
"Fq4 guidance is being downsized, thats why it is plummeting, good buying opportunity tho!"
The Zacks Rank #2 company has an expected earnings growth rate of 17.4% for the current year (ending June 2020). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved by 1.9% over the past 30 days.
"If premarket price rolls into the open, I will be a buying!"
I guess I got doomed...... like someone said massive dumping at the last hour. not a good news for tomorrow. Will go down $3-4 more
"MRCY is walking back their near-term organic growth rate but long-term financial goals are still intact. Covid related costs and supply chain delays are affecting short-term results, but backlog is strong and growing. Don't let the chart scare you out of your shares"
WOW! Picked me up 100 shares at this price.
Super buy. I'm in.
Mercury Systems is up 4.90% to 52.45
"They beat 0.54 vs 0.51 and 210M vs 209 ... as for guidance, it is flat ... great stock long term"
I am in for earnings hold through at 49.21
MRCY is up 4.90% to 43.87
"Time to add more I see bottom at 44.52. I am already over-weighted here, but such a great company."
"Someone posted that MRCY is an earnings play. That poster apparently knows nothing about MRCY's business. MRCY is a LT national defense play, with most their sales going into programs that have a life span of 10, 20, or more years. I have been thru these sell offs before. MRCY went from 50+ to 33 in 2018, at that time they had some EPS issues. That just creates a buying opp, because the nature of their business will eventually resurrect the stock price. 33 to 85 in 18 months? that calls for a sell off. imo, buying now and holding for another 18 months will get you 100++, market conditions permitting."
