"I didn't purchase any Coke products again today. And I have dumped all my shares months ago. I'm embarrassed for this once-great company, and i don't want a dime of any profits they may make."
I already sold most of my position...bracing for 50$ if covid is back and the spx will sell off.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Great dividend investment. I will be adding to my position every week at these low $50 levels.
"KO will never go over $60. I guess I'll just hold for the dividend. But, it would be nice to see it move a little more"
happy div day
"Let's all give a round of applause to Coca Cola CEO Quincey for beating Wall Street expectations in his last 7 earnings reports , and bet ya on Oct.21 2021 will be his eight beat . What a great CEO!!!!!! Right Best????"
Is it true that the Coke CEO will not sell Coke in Texas now? Texas just passed a law to make voting easier but cheating harder just like Georgia! Well KO ceo??? Where’s your left wing agenda now?
Yet Morningstar rates KO neutral! There are Better places for your money. Using the average over the first 6 months may hide the declining sales month over month. Be wary of the politics of the CEO!
"I also never found discount prices on any of the other Coca Cola drinks like Sprite , Fanta , Schweppes , Minute Maid , Dasani , and Monster energy drinks were selling at full price . But Best wants you to think that Coca Cola stock price is going to crash because his local Walmart is selling Coca Cola Classic at half price ,Ya right LOL!!!!! Oh and I just got back from lunch at Firehouse Subs , place was packed with people eating sub sandwiches and sucking down Coca Cola soda pop."
"Consider that Coke is selling on discount! Incremental sales increases can raise stock prices. Likewise, decremental sales can lower stock prices. These are the facts despite what Howie says! The stock price is based on ALL sales not just restaurant sales."
Just buy on the dips you'll be fine!!!!!
Buy below 56 dollars and hold for 25 years. Reap dividends.

Buy 1 or 2 shares a week and you will be in a great long term position.
So inflation is bad when it increases your stock portfolio increases your home value wall is so full of it
What is the board's take on KO being a sponsor of the 2022 Beijing Olympics?
Got some shares in at 41.5 today. Looking to get more when it hits around the $40 mark. Until good news comes out you can expect some more high sell off days. I don’t see this getting much lower than 35 though but saving some money aside just in case to capitalize on that as well. Buy in chunks and set your orders at price points you’re wanting to hit so you don’t miss them. This company will bounce back as always and it’s not too often you get discounted prices like this for amazing companies. Take advantage of this chaos. You’ll look back in 5 years and be glad you did. Getting these shares with the dividend yield being over 3% now is an amazing opportunity for long term investors
"Consider:Just think about how much greater this company could be without a ceo imposing his own politics on it? No CEO of ANY company should put his personal politics over what’s best for the company! Risking any portion of the companies’ customer base for selfish political reasons, is tantamount to preventing the company & its stock from reaching its full potential! That imho should be subject to a class action lawsuit!Not just Coke, but Delta, Norwegian Cruise lines, etc!"
The overall market is overpriced. KO is a safe bet. Profit is distributed around the globe and people drink coke during good and bad times.
"What happened to Coca-Cola's moral outrage with Georgia's new voting law? I thought they were protesting and refusing to sponsor events in Georgia? I see they are the prime sponsor for Golf's Tour Championship. Did they compromise or realize their inconsistency? Is Coca-Cola a company that morals are driven by perceived ""wind-blowing"" public perception?"
pepsi up 1.4% and KO 0.4%!
"Since Coke's CEO steered them into Politics, misrepresented facts, and told his employees of certain colors that they had to go through special training to learn how NOT to act that color, I am STAYING AWAY from all Coke products."
Don’t miss the 4 th qtr move international money will be swooping in
"Quincey supporters, how cheaply you sell out your principles! Even Judas got 30 pieces of silver!"
"Hey Woke-A-Dopes the share holders of Coca Cola are not going to get rid of James Quincey , after all the man has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports ."
When is cole going to split again
Kelly & Quincey CEO’s of Southwest Airlines & Coke the two woke pansy’s afraid of doing what’s right! Both must go!
The ONLY stock in my portfolio that isn't back to the pre-pandemic crash price.
I just want to buy more ko stock love their products and dividend
"Has anyone here tried the new Coke Zero? I had been reading some peoples comments about it and went out to buy some old just in case I didn’t like the new, at least have some for a while since it’s shelf life is limited, and they had taken all the old Coke Zero off the shelf. Wonder where that goes? Food Bank? Guess we’ll see."
KO down again?
I have been an investor for 25 years and KO has been an extremely great investment for me...I remember in the 1940s drinking a bottle that sold for 5 cents...
Long term stock. Solid dividend and modest growth after COVID. Stay long.
Is 60 possible at the end of year ?:)
Should I buy ko shares . I’m new to the stock market ?
"( Coca-Cola’s 20 Billion Dollar Brands & Future Growth!!!!! Coca-Cola (KO) has long been a favorite of income investors, due to its impressive history of dividend growth. Coca-Cola has increased its dividend for 58 consecutive years. It has one of the longest active streaks of annual dividend increases in the entire S&P 500 Index. ) What the boycotters are missing is that Coca Cola is more then a soda pop company , and sells its drinks in 200 countries . Minute Maid was Coca-Cola’s first non-carbonated beverage. Coca-Cola acquired Minute Maid in 1960. Coca-Cola has been in the juice business for ~60 years , Minute Maid Pulpy was launched in China in 2005. The company reached billion dollar brand status in 2010,after just 5 years. Simply Orange , Coca-Cola acquired Del Valle in 2007 for a total of $470 million in 2010, Coca-Cola grew Del Valle to reach $1 billion a year in annual sales. Powerade was released in 1988 , Powerade has reached market share of approximately 16% of the sports drink market . Glaceau Vitamin Water was acquired by Coca-Cola in 2007 for $4.1 billion. Along with Vitamin Water, Glaceau also sells Vitamin Water Zero Sugar. The deal was Coca-Cola’s largest acquisition at the time. Aquarius is the leading sports drink in Japan. Coca-Cola also sells water under the Aquarius brand in various countries. Coca-Cola released Aquarius in 1983. Gold Peak tea was released in the United States in 2006. It reached billion dollar brand status by 2014. In 2007 Coca-Cola had 10 billion dollar brands. Just 8 years later, the company reached 20 billion dollar brands. The company sells 2 billion beverage servings every day. Just like the 2014 American the Beautiful boycott the right wing missed the point on how huge a company Coca Cola is , and with Coca Cola acquiring Costa Coffee in 2019 , gives Coca-Cola a strong coffee platform across parts of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa . Nobody is going to get rid of James Quincey who has beat wall street's expectations in the last 7 earnings report ."
"Howard lamented that I ""never post about the Dividend (sic) payouts"".Two days ago I posted some numbers re KO's, PEP's and VTI's dividend history. I hope it read this post, but just in case, I'll ""post (more) about the Dividend (sic) payouts"":While pretty meaningless, a FUN! metric is Yield on Cost (YOC).For example, had someone bought KO shares in 1985 (or earlier) @1.68 or lower, their KO position would have a 100% (or greater) YOC.I'm only long two stocks that have YOCs >100%, clocking in @129.4% and 104.4%. I have two other positions that have YOCs of 97.6% & 98.2%. Within the next few months, these positions will also have YOCs >100%.In conclusion, although over the past twenty years KO's dividend policy has only slightly kept ahead of the market's, and it pales over PEP's payout history, over time dividends do grow and they can be a significant portion of one's income."
Sold 3 52.5 put and sold 9 52.5 calls for friday
I stole a bike today. Is that good enough for Coca Cola?
"Great stock started out with 40 shares 25 yrs ago, now have 1600 shares and never took a dividend, bought shares instead. Now I get over 600 dollars every quarter, Now i get between 40 and 45 shares a year. Not exciting but very stable and it grows."
"Maybe KO will regain its mojo--I wouldn't count it out nor do I think it has been or will be impacted by any ""boycott"".Since 2014, it's dividend growth has significantly trailed its closest peer (PEP) and the market.Dividend growth since 2014:KO 37.7%PEP 89.4%Blend of VOO & SPY 70.5%For those interested in not only an INCREASING income stream, but also capital appreciation (even if one is content with exclusively living on dividends and not touching their principal, it might nonetheless want to grow their principal for the benefit of its heirs), going with a broadly based index fund/ETF would have been the way to go and very well may be the way to go going forward.Full disclosure: Total market funds/ETF represent ~66% of my equity exposure. PEP has a 1.27% weight. No KO position."
Please fall under $50
IQ question for the board is today's close of 54.44 higher are lower then last years close of 50.55????
The volume has been light since July which is positive for a price decline. Expect a monster rebound in the next couple weeks.
"Yahoo is asking how I am feeling about KO. The answer is that I'm not feeling too good about it, given that Mr. Quincey is still in charge, and given that he has turned many life long Coke drinkers, like me, away from Coke products."
1 doallar move in Dow stocks 7 pt move
Coca-Cola Co. said Thursday it will raise its dividend by 2.6% and has set a new program to repurchase up to 150 million shares.
"The left & Howie, so afraid of words in a post that they delete them! It must be miserable to live life so much in fear! Coke ceo must resign to save the company! Or is he only concerned about himself??"
Shepard did a bit last night on Pepsi coming out with that disgusting mountain dew drink. He mentioned coca cola already had a seltzer called topo Chico. A lot of people still don't know about it and it's an extremely popular brand for those that do. It is the best tasting one on the market. Higher priced too so better margins.With this CEO I assure you they will dabble into cbd drinks once it's legalized or at least invest in a company. Coca cola is conservative and waiting on legalization. That is where the growth sector for this company will come from.
"Nice move on Coca Cola stock today , no wonder Warren Buffett list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy has Coca Cola at number 4 best stock to buy , and one of the top ten popular stocks that hedge funds are buying , that alone tells you shares of Coca Cola are under continual accumulation. Oh and just got back from shopping at the HEB supermarket , no Coca Cola products are selling at half price ."
"KO is always a good investment, with a dip buy more."
Other nice safe dividend stocks let me now. Is this stock a hold for 20+ years?
good stock for long term good dividend
investing KO style
"Unloaded some @57 today. Hopefully it hits 58 before ex-div to drop more, but I'm not holding my breath.."
"You would figure going on 57.5 years of dividend increases the board approving the next one even knowing earnings might lag? Shows this company is committed to shareholders and realize while the chips are down, it's darkest b4 dawn. This isn't Ko's 1st pandemic unfortunately, however they are going to recover from this. Be patient but if you're in already ya know. On the fence? Think it's just a sugar water co? Do little research an add a nice defense stock that will pay off being patient. I'm long Ko!"
Thanks Mr. Quincey.
buy? or it will sink more ?
Bought this in today. Great value. Great cash flow. Great dividend. Great brand portfolio. The water is now treated as commodity trading in the futures market. KO with its water portfolio will skyrocket soon or later. Accumulation time.
KO down on an up day! Hmm?
"Another green day for Coca Cola stock , great dividend Stock , great corporate governance team , with a great CEO that has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports."
The power of dividends !!
Going below $54? I wonder if CEO Quincey is aware of that. Or if he's busy with his political agenda today.
Of stocks I expected to fall coke wasn't on that list. Is anyone buying less coke due to covid?

"This time next year, KO will be at 63.00 a share"
"I look at KO as an alternative to bonds as a place to stash cash with dividend and future upside. It will likely beat the case vs. the IRS, or take a more limited charge than the projected hit.

"( For example, had someone bought KO shares in 1985 (or earlier) @1.68 ) Not a bad investment back in 1985 . 2000 shares of Coca Cola for an investment of $3,360 . So how would that investment be worth today? Coca Cola has had 5 stock splits since 1985 , 3 for 1 in 1986 , and 4 2 for 1 splits in 1990 , 1992 , 1996 , and 2012 so today you would have 96,000 shares of Coca Cola worth $5,156,160 , and a dividend payout of 161,280 a year .

Over the course of 1988 and 1989, Buffett took an enormous position in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Due to its rapid gains over the course of 1989, the stock quickly became Berkshire's largest holding by the end of that year . Based on today's dividend, Berkshire will receive $672 million in Coca-Cola dividends for its 400 million shares. This is against Berkshire's overall cost basis of $1,299 million, good for a yield of 51.7%.Oh, and the story should get even better this March, when Coca-Cola typically raises its payout -- something it's done for the past 59 straight years, making it not just a Dividend Aristocrat but a Dividend King. ) This time next year, KO will be at 63.00 a share !!!!!! I based that opinion on what Berkshire Hathaway, Inc , Vanguard Group, Inc , Blackrock Inc. , State Street Corporation , Wellington Management Group, LLP , JP Morgan Chase & Company , Morgan Stanley , 3,168 of Institutions Holding Shares , and 27 brokerage firms rating Coca Cola as a buy , are saying .

Every weekend millions of Americans will be going to football games , and sucking down Coca Cola soda pop."
Imagine if you will a ceo willing to put a company at risk of losing customers to satisfy his selfish political stance! He has no problem risking your future for his cocktail party popularity! Quincey is doing to Coke what Immelt did to GE!
"I work very hard for my money. Every payday, I invest some in stocks. I invest in coke inorder to sleep well at night. If all else fails, at least I will have one stable company. The rest is all speculation."
"Over the next 8-10 years, 25% of all stock market returns will be from dividends. Bank of America forecasts the S&P 500 to grow 35-66% over the next decade. That's only 3.5% per year. Dividend players will be a huge talking point in the stock market for years to come."
"Boy the Woke-A-Dope protesters are getting desperate!!!!! In the wee early hours of the morning 12 Woke-A-Dope protesters chained themselves to the doors of a local Chick-fil-A , in hopes of stopping people from buying Coca Cola soda pop . That brought out the City Police , swat team , hostage negotiators , mental health professionals , and a huge amount of onlookers and gawker. Took a bit of time , but the Chick-fil-A did just fine , the drive threw window was doing a huge business ."
"KO is up today! Look at it go! $54.06 per share. And just as a reminder, KO ended CY 2020 at $54.84, meaning that in a year where the DJIA is up 15%, KO is up 0%. Let's all give a round of applause to CEO Quincey."
i like the divvy but yikes...this stock takes moths to move a buck or 2
"Just rename this company to ""Sears"", already. My take is that this company suffers a long, slow, and painful demise; perhaps over the next 10 years or so. The younger generations view their products as poison - literally. Older generations are out since offended by the woke CEO who has been flailing by spending millions on more than 200 experimental product lines, all of which have failed. If you think an old brand like this is unsinkable, you might want to ask some of the die hard JCPenny investors. There were lots of those too."
Call spreads on Woke looking good. Will easily expire worthless Friday. Sweet!
Yep I think this stock in an excellent stable stock long term. When you have this kind of revenue and brand recognition it presents the board a lot of options. KO is all about management. When the rotation $$ returns to this sector it will pop 8%. As we get closer to opening the economy it will pop another 10%. Keep an eye on the Q4 earnings and the back taxes litigation.
Market is up but I don't see any reason why KO is dropping nicely today. The only reason I know is I bought this stock yesterday that's why it's dropping.
Long $KO! One of the great American companies!
KO 60 today..
when Tec and the gme type stocks pull back and there is a inverted market where do you think people will put there cash? you cant just keep throwing money at the same stock it will pull back then fear kicks in so they will look for a safe haven in value stocks that pay dividends and still have an up side like $KO...
"Putting aside all the funny chatter, thoughts why is the price struggling to move up....we all know the reopen is in full forward motion, could it be the supply chain sympathy trading? Thoughts please. Thanks."
"Anyone else thinking this might just soar back up to its high this year, like 59?"
When will they buy Monster and Body armour?
Bought 17 shares today at $53. Going to start taking a strong position with KO.
"The Coke CEO is the Oren Boyle of modern day! In Atlas Shrugs, Oren is so busy fixing his “social justice causes” that he runs the business into the ground! KO don’t let that happen to you!"
In the 6 years I have owned this stock I have averaged an 8% return if you include the dividends I have received. That's good enough for me at my age and I can sleep at night. I'm fortunate I didn't have to sell any shares during the worst of the pandemic pull back. I'm not planning to sell any shares for another 8 years. I have started taking the dividends as cash recently as retirement income. I reinvested them the first 5 years. It's impressive how much of a difference that made. I should have started doing that 30 years ago when I was in my 30's. I highly recommend that all young people do exactly that. Start young and just contribute what you can each month. You will be amazed what happens over time.
"For 8 years I worked for a very successful 80+ year old financial firm that managed over $2T in assets. Research on a particular market was always 20x more than the largest players in it. With that said, what is happening in the soda market? Has consumption in this market peaked? If so, when did that happen? Are polar bears, little up and down icons, and advice from “experts” justification for betting on the biggest fish in a dying pond?"
Easy 7% return per year.

just hold. ko is slow but steady . reopening stocks will catch up with ko as more people go out and consume. its only up from here...
Plenty of discount prices on a number of Coke products. Does not bode well for future quarterly results imho!
I love this company ! I took a sizeable position in this stock last November and it has done very well :)
Just checking in on KO today. Below 55! That's no surprise.
"Another fun fact about Coca Cola !!!!!! Dunkin’ Donuts’ new line of bottled, ready-to-drink (RTD) iced coffee beverages are hitting refrigerator cases at grocery, convenience stores, mass merchandisers, and participating Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants throughout the U.S. Through an agreement announced last September, The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners are producing and distributing the bottled beverages in four flavors: Original, Mocha, Espresso and French Vanilla. You can buy them at Wal Mart and Coca Cola gets part of the $2.3 billion in annual sales ."
"( Poor Howie, you just don’t understand incremental sales particularly their impact on profit over and above break even do you? LOL!) You said that last OT Best , and Coca Cola beat earnings . Think I will go with the Institutions holding 69.43% of the shares , 26 analysts that rate the stock , 59 years of Dividend incress , and not with some right winger reporting fake news from his local Walmart."
Dow Jones up. KO down. I wonder if CEO Quincey is aware of that.
Joined the KO bandwagon today looking to continue to build it this year and hold forever as time has shown this is a great stock to have in the portfolio
ko has been falling like 2% a week. isn't this supposed to be a defensive stock? trading more like a tech stock
I'll keep coke until I retire
"I believe KO and PEP are both undervalued at these levels. I don't care about all the companies that downgraded KO recently, long term it is still a solid play. The dividend pays you to wait for the capital returns and they continue to improve their drink selections and penetrate new markets. Once the economy gets rolling again and restaurants open there will more Coke beverages for people to enjoy. Long term I am bullish and you should be too. They have incredible staying power in good times and bad and they have strong brand loyalty. There is not much here to dislike."
I'll take that. 
I love KO for dividend and long term play. Was curious to know how many shares you guys have?
"Hi Everyone. New here. Just bought in today. Looking forward to adding shares regularly, and taking advantage of that great Dividend. GLTA."
Overall KO held up nicely today
"Bet grandma's rent money on KO, MCD, ABT, and JNJ. Thank me later!"
"Bought 15 shares of KO today to start my long term investments off, and to make my account safer."
I will hold this for life.
i have stocked up 10 times more cases of coca cola than normal. but im drinking 3 times as much. i don't think demand will be an issue after the virus.
Best vs . Warren Buffett 10 Best Stocks to Buy posted one day ago . 4. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO)Number of hedge fund holders: 62 The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company. It is placed fourth on our list of 10 best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. Latest data shows that Berkshire Hathaway owned 400 million shares in the beverage maker at the end of June 2021. These are worth $21.6 billion and represent 7.38% of the investment portfolio of the Buffett-led company. Never trust someone posting on the internet trying to scare you into selling your shares .
"I sleep like a baby knowing I own hundreds of shares of KO. I bought a few weeks ago, and with low interest rates and a safe dividend its a good hold long term. It seldom goes on sale, which allows value investors to now buy in. I'm holding for 30 years."
When you see all of these people come out of the woodwork to advise yo uto sell you know it means to buy more because they are afraid of the buying pressure.From a technical level KO broke out of the last 2 channels. The third time is when it won't drop again. We reach 57.50 and it's going to skyrocket to 60 by end of September at the latest.
"Tried AHA Sparkling water for the first time today. I gotta say, Coca-Cola nailed it. Very refreshing beverage with amazing flavor."
Collect those dividends.
When does Ko pay the dividend? And how much is it for each stock please someone ?
"Some companies with a larger market cap than Affirm's $38B: Coca Cola $KO, Starbucks $SBUX, TJMaxx $TJX, Docusign $DOCU, Ross Stores $ROST. Affirm is scaling their volume by about 2 X per year without purchasing inventory or real estate or fulfillment centers. Own Quality."
"Coke - Fun Fact: YTD Performance (since Jan 4, 2021)Dow Jones: Up 13.6%Pepsi: Up 4.6%Coke: Up 0.5%"
One way to get rich - buy KO
55+ today 57+ close to earning 10/27
"( Buffet's stock portfolio remains highly concentrated in a handful of companies. In Q2, 69% of its aggregate value was in Apple (AAPL) ($124.3 billion) and Bank of America (BAC) ($42.6 billion). Also, American Express (AXP) ($25.1 billion), and Coca-Cola (KO) ($21.6 billion).) So Buffet owns 21.6 billion of Coca Cola stock , we will know if Buffet sold any shares of Coca Cola when the 2 OT 13-F comes out in the next few days that will give an in depth look into assets Berkshire bought and sold during the second quarter."
"What out for poster like Best Man they never do any due diligence on coca cola stock , it's all political . Take the Institutional Ownership report for the first 6 months of 2021 . Increased Positions 1,152 holders brought 122,167,993 shares , Decreased positions 1,098 holders sold 90,987,624 shares . New and sold out positions , New Positions 138 new holders brought 17,922,849 shares , and Sold out positions 99 holders sold 5,262,393 shares . Institutions hold 69.48% of Coca Cola outstanding shares !!!!! So lots of Americas bigest Institutions are buying shares of Coca Cola . That is a big reason Coca Coal shares have moved from a low of 47.30 to 53.02 in the last 52 weeks ."
"What a great earnings report for Coca Cola it beat wall street expectations by 20.78% . James Quincey became Coca Cola CEO in December 2016 , and this is his 19th earnings report ,17 earnings reports have beat wall street expectations . What a great CEO and company to invest in ."
what happened here ? I bought some for 56.65 I think and immediately it goes to 55.81.... I was thinking coke Is one of the best sweet drink in world.... like I drink it a lot everyone around me drink it a lot idk what's happening...
Should i buy ????
"I also never found no discount prices on any Diet Coke , Cheery Coke , Coke Zero , Caffeine Free Coke , and A&W root beer . I think Best is telling a big old fib , trying to scare people into selling their Coca Cola shares."
I awoke and sold all 200 shares. Pepsi pays better dividend so sending my money elsewhere-just my opinion no one else’s good luck.
"Got to love the boycotters , if Coca Cola was going to tank like the boycotters are saying then why would 1,148 Institutional Owners incress their shares in the first 6 months , like Vanguard 3,940,364 new shares, State Street 3,191,797 , JP Morgan 2,117,492 , Charles Schwab 3,5562,145 , and Morgan Stanley ????"
Watch out for accounting games by this ceo! His job is on the line. If he plays with the numbers then revealed it could seriously hurt this good company! Of course that may be a great buying opportunity especially when he’s gone!
"IQ question for best!!!!!! Coca Cola is trading at 56.88 a share today , is that price closer to it's 52 week low of 46.97 or 52 week high of 57.56 ???????"
"KO is as close to a ""buy and hold forever"" stock as they come IMO. So far this year, Q1, Q2, and Q3, KO has beaten earning expectations. KO is one of the best global brands, if not the best. It also pays a sensible dividend... I normally add KO shares during Q4. Once Spring and Summer comes around, revenue gets a boost. G'luck y'all!"
"In an earlier post, Howard lamented ""Both never post about the Dividend payouts"".Besides entertainment, message boards offer a platform to exchange relevant information.I'm more than happy to appease Howard--let's go to the tape!KO paid 0.42/share on 10/1/21. KO paid 0.09/share on 10/1/01. KO's dividend has increased by 367%VTI paid 0.7242/share on 9/29/21 VTI paid 0.1575/share on 9/28/01VTI's dividend has increased by 360%PEP paid 1.075/share on 9/30/21 PEP paid 0.145/share on 9/28/01PEP's dividend has increased by 641%Hmmmmmmmm.Of course, the dividend is just part of the investment equation. Share appreciate matters, at least for most people! This is why I posted TOTAL RETURN figures.Total Return 10 years followed by 20 years:KO 120% 311%VTI 367% 557%S&P500ConsumerIndex 209% 467%PEP 232% 412%Conclusion: while PEP's dividend has significantly increased over the past twenty years, KO's has BARELY kept up with the total market's payout! Both KO & PEP have underperformed the market, over the past twenty years, but CLEARLY one did much better holding PEP than KO (numbers do not lie).Full disclosure:Dividend info and return figures from a subscription BloombergI am long PEP, VTI, VTSAX & FSKAX.Howard: what say ye?"
i bought my original shares in August of 2015. Based on my experience you should expect to see $60 again by the end of 2021. I personally am not expecting more than that. Keeping my expectations realistic.
Just added 2000 shares to my position.Great company/Buying Opportunity!
been in red for almost 2 weeks straight
I hereby declare it’s a good time to buy or add KO stock shares.
Who’s ready for another good dividend?
He loves new Coke Zero Sugar 
KO needs to announce that it is getting into EV business using KO's formula. That alone will jump $20. This market makes no sense.
Warren Buffet loves KO. Remember that. Long $KO#$%$
My local Safeway finally got a shipment of the new Coke Zero. And I must say it is in fact noticeably better than the old Coke Zero. I actually like it as much as Coke Classic. I'm impressed.
I wish Woka-cola would stop playing politics... can share holder sue?
I’m a long term holder of CocaCola and I am selling my shares and walking. This company needs to keep their eye on business and stay out of politics.How dare they speak for the shareholders of this company.
"am i tripping, or is this a fantastic opportunity to buy? 0% chance of this company failing and easy 20% upside in the next few months. decent dividend... am i missing something?"
Christmas ko commercial coming Christmas cheer
I predict Ko will announce a small dividend increase February 18th. 
1 year projected price is $62. 5 year projected price is $81. I realize that projections don't always mean much but it's a good indicator for future expectations. Slow and steady is how KO operates in the market. This gives you a great opportunity to accumulate a strong position over time. The dividend is fantastic. I will be purchasing 30 shares soon at low to mid $50's.
If Coke decides to get in the political ring and it looks like the president has.......The stock is on the way down. It is a no win. His job is to sell product and should not get into anything the company can be held hostage for.
"20% upside from here in 1 year easy. KO cut the organizational fat, reduced spend and positioned for huge EPS gains by then."
how many shares of KO should I have for this to be a worthwhile investment 
"Not buying diet coke anymore (in fact have permanent boycott on Coca Cola). Have no need to watch MLB, NFL, NBA, Oscars, NBC,ABC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN ect (in person or on tv). As soon as any corporation proclaims they support left wing democrat politics and act try to punish opponents of democrat politics I permanently have no use for that corporation or its products."
"@howard, if you have even a sliver of an open mind, Google Vivek Ramaswamy , he will provide you with an AHA moment! After hearing Vivek you too will call for the KO ceo to resign! He’ll also convince you it’s not just KO! It’s the NBA, & others that are selling out the USA for China! If you have a closed mind then don’t bother!"
"I’m not a big fish, but today worked out nicely. I like picking up T whenever it hits $29ish and KO had a nice pullback to $45 this morning, so I picked up 50 more shares of each. Lather, rinse, repeat, and hopefully, some day I’ll thank myself."
The boycott really hasn’t figured into earnings yet. Sell
"As a Southerner growing up in Alabama about 128 miles south down I-85 from ATL, where we still call any soda a ""coke."" It saddens me that Coke Cola couldn't stick to its business of protecting the ""secret formula"" and producing sodas. Based on Coke Cola's decision to delve into Georgia's politics, my family and I will never purchase nor drink another swallow of a Cola Coke product - NEVER. The Coke Cola products that were in the house this morning were thrown into the tote away first thing. Our 56 year relationship is over Coke. I hope UA and Alabama football make the same decision in the coming days."
"Top ten popular stocks that hedge funds are buying Apple Inc , Bank of America Corp , Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , American Express Company , Amazon Inc , Visa Inc , Charter Communications Inc , and The Coca Cola Company . So hedge funds are buying shares of Coca Cola is great news for stock owners , but not great news for best . I think best needs to call up all the Hedge fund mangers and tell them how the share price of Coca Cola is going to crash because his local Walmart is selling Coca Cola at half price . LOL !!!"
Stock should go back at least around $55 sooner then later. Movie theaters and restaurants will send it up and the more normalcy we get the better it will do. Ko is solid cause its bought + sold all over the world so you're not dependent on just the states. They've gotten into Coffee and many other brands. I don't see them going anywhere and long term you will win. KO Long!
"WOW!!!! Coca-Cola Consolidated Reports Second Quarter and First Half 2021 Results just came out !!!!! Second quarter of 2021 net sales increased 17% versus the second quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 income from operations was $121 million, up $38 million, or 45%, versus the second quarter of 2020 , and Income from operations for the first half of 2021 was $215 million, up $99 million, or 86%, versus the first half of 2020 . COKE Stock was up $5.90 in regular trading , and up $2.19 in AH . Another solid earnings report out of a great American company named Coca Cola ."
"Four of the largest Fast food Restrunts in America that serve Coca Cola !!!!! Subway with 21,769 location's in the U.S. , McDonalds 18,332 , Burger King , 7,213 , Wendy's 5,865 , and that is just four of 22 fast food restrunts . Millions of Americans eat fast foods , and suck down Coca Cola soda pop every day ."
"Gonna start a small position. If it Goes below $50 will throw a lot more in. Adding this to my boring boomer portfolio of dividend stocks consisting of consumer staples, healthcare, ETFS and real estate. I like long steady growth. Do I miss out on short term growth in tech? Definitely. But I like to sleep at night knowing my money is working for me in the long run."
"LaBron James is switching to Pepsi endorsement contract. Hey, there are plenty of young superstars out there that KO can get for a lower price. James is near the end of his career, so I expect a new face would be better from that stand point too."
Nearly doubled my position on -1.30% dip.
"Remember,BE LESS WHITE and maybe the stock price will go up."
"Wake up Woke-A-Dopes the Institutional share holders of Coca Cola are not going to get rid of James Quincey , after all they own 69% of the shares and Quincey has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports ."
"IQ question for best!!!!!! What is the higher stock price Jan 1 2021 at 52.76 , or todays price of 56.81 ?????"
Animals for James Quincey. We love you 
Well I bought for 56.50 and This is still red.. .why.. i am traveling around the world and COKE is still dominate on tables at least in europe
The slow but steady ride to retirement with Coca-Cola stock.
"KO is a buy and hold stock, hello $60s"
Almost breakeven again after many months.
buy more. still a $190 billion market cap. huge company. good things in the future.
"Boy how did I miss this one?????? The Zacks Research Aug 30th Shares of Coca-Cola have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. +11.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that shares of Coca-Cola outpaced the industry in the past year, thanks to its robust earnings surprise trend that continued in second-quarter 2021. This marked the seventh straight quarter of earnings beats and its second consecutive sales beat.The company’s top line bounced back from the decline witnessed in the prior-year quarter, mainly owing to the increased consumer mobility and reopening of economies in several regions, which led to increased away-from-home channel sales. Revenues reflected gains from improved price/mix, an increase in concentrate sales and higher unit case volume.The company is poised to gain from accelerating investments to expand its digital presence. However, the company witnessed pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs. It witnessed higher marketing spends compared with the prior-year quarter. But Best wants you to think the share price of Coca Cola are going to crash because his ( Wink!! Wink!!) Walmart is selling it at half price ."
is this good entry point for long term?
"I am not a big investor (i just bought 100 shares). I did this based on Topo Chico beverage owned by KO. It used to be a niche product in my grocery store, now it has over 5 feet of shelf space and is constantly being bought out. It is good on its own and good as an adult mixed drink compliment. I see it growing in popularity in the liquor stores for the reason I just mentioned. I'm sure there is good margin in sparkling water...looking for good things at close of the day."
"Fortunately, James Quincey isn't going anywhere anytime soon. He has done an excellent job managing the company through the pandemic and everything else during the past few years. His managing of the Coca-Cola turnaround and restructuring plan has also been solid. Kent chose Quincey as his replacement. Perhaps the best decision Kent ever made."
My goal is to have 100 shares of KO by the end of 2022.
KO has a return of 4.7% YTD. Plus a 3% dividend yield. I will be taking a very strong position soon.
Two words. Topo Chico.
TO THE MOON!
"Just got back from dinner at Chick-fil-A place was packed , and people were still sucking down Coca Cola soda pop with their food . Then I stopped by Walgreen and just like Walmart Coca Cola was selling at full price in Walgreens , no wonder hedge funds are buying more shares of Coca Cola ."
$60 by October! Long KO!!!!!
"Every time you drink an ice cold bottle of Coca-Cola, the American flag waves proudly behind you. Long KO!!!!"
