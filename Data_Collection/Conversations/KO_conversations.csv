8 Billion for Body Armor
"Excellent earnings report this morning and decent conference call, 2022 looking very positive - as long as this pandemic gets under control, KO should really excel forward, tough day in the market as usual and KO still held up nicely. Will be looking for some upgraded price targets in the coming weeks, I believe Nov/Dec price action will be considerably higher from here, congratulations to KO & shareholders here. Another Dividend will be paid mid December and I believe it's the 3rd week of February every year, when KO announces their Dividend increase for the year, looking forward to this also.."
"Coca Cola under the leadership of James Quincey has beat wall street's expectations in the last 7 earnings reports . That is why Coca Cola is a great buy and hold dividend aristocrat for any retierment account , they have always had great leadership ."
Coca-Cola has until the end of this year to decide if it is going to move forward with the acquisition of Body Armor.
Earnings beat let’s go KO

"Voice of Reason the share holders of Coca Cola need your expertise . Can you tell us why the DJIA was down 266 points , but Coca Cola was up $ 1.04 , we don't seem to have a clue . TIA!!!!!!"
"Good news/bad news:The Braves lost last night (bad)The good news is there will be THREE All Star games played at Truist Park. There's even a ""Coke Corner"" that incorporates multiple left field sections. Any ticket in the Coca-Cola Corner comes with a free 20 ounce Coke product!!!.I imagine television views will see ""Coke"" a few times during the next three games being broadcast. A bit of a bonus for the bucks KO pays to be a ""part"" of the Braves."
"Karel, expect $56 by year end and an increase in dividend for 2022. Share price somewhere around $60 to $62 by end of 2022. That's kind of how this stock goes. Don't expect more than 10% total increase per year including the dividends over time. Just be prepared to hang on during the down times like the past two years. So in the long run, like I said, Don't expect more than 7% annual growth plus the 3% dividend."
Happy long term holder
"Great Buffet stock, consistent growth and dividends, another nice quarter. I, for one, will keep accumulating and reinvesting the dividends."
"WOW!!!!! Another nice up move on Coca Cola shares today closing at 56.02 , last year on Oct. 28 2020 Coca Cola shares closed at 47.98 , that is up 8.06 a share , and a dividend payout of 1.63 a share . Not a bad investment , and a great job by Quincey"
"I am very eager to see what KO can/will do with Costa Coffee, KO owns the second largest coffee chain in the world :-)"
"Does anyone else ever contemplate how a CEO can be making millions in stock options, and yet he is unable to get the stock price higher than it was at the beginning of the year - in a double digit bull market?"
"Anonymous, I do appreciate your optimism and I am a believer in this company and have been for years. But if Coca-Cola hits $60 by the end of this year, I'll buy you a Coke and stand corrected."
Wonder if they will buy Monster and Body Armour
Congrats to all KO shareholders.
"Today Credit Suisse designated KO/Coca-Cola a ""Top Pick"" and reiterated its' Outperform rating with a $63 price target.."
Adding a share every week at these levels. That will put me at 70+ shares in a year.
I'm up 2.36% with KO. Purchased 17 shares on October 5th.
Bought 17 shares today at $53. Going to start taking a strong position with KO.
When will KO go above $ 60?

"Tried AHA Sparkling water for the first time today. I gotta say, Coca-Cola nailed it. Very refreshing beverage with amazing flavor."
"One year old fun fact ( After being acquired by Coca Cola for £3.9bn ($4.8bn) in late 2018, it was only a matter of time before Costa Coffee entered the US market, where the global brand has been curiously absent. Speaking on an investor call on October 22 2020, Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO James Quincey reiterated his firm’s intention to become a “global multi-platform coffee company under the Costa brand.”) November 10, 2020 Costa Coffee Acquires Austin-Based Coffee Kiosk Maker Briggo . Costa has yet to open any brick-and-mortar coffee shops in the United States, it does operate about 50 “Smart Cafes” around the country. Those are essentially freestanding super-automatic bean-to-cup beverage vending machines, capable of a variety of milk-based coffee drinks. All are operated and managed by the Costa Coffee team in Austin, Texas . Another reason Coca Cola is a great buy , and if Costa Coffee starts opening brick-and-mortar coffee shops in the United States it will give Starbucks a run for their money ."
The negatives sure are quiet this morning
"Got to love the boycotters , if Coca Cola was going to tank like the boycotters are saying then why would 1,148 Institutional Owners incress their shares in the first 6 months , like Vanguard 3,940,364 new shares, State Street 3,191,797 , JP Morgan 2,117,492 , Charles Schwab 3,5562,145 , and Morgan Stanley ????"
Does KO pay the dividend quarterly or once per year?
I love that Coca Cola pays the Q4 dividend right before Christmas.
Nice bump today! Long KO!
In the 6 years I have owned this stock I have averaged an 8% return if you include the dividends I have received. That's good enough for me at my age and I can sleep at night. I'm fortunate I didn't have to sell any shares during the worst of the pandemic pull back. I'm not planning to sell any shares for another 8 years. I have started taking the dividends as cash recently as retirement income. I reinvested them the first 5 years. It's impressive how much of a difference that made. I should have started doing that 30 years ago when I was in my 30's. I highly recommend that all young people do exactly that. Start young and just contribute what you can each month. You will be amazed what happens over time.
My new favorite stock. Currently KO is only 6% of my portfolio. I would like to see that closer to 25% by next Summer.
Great dividend investment. I will be adding to my position every week at these low $50 levels.
Buy 1 or 2 shares a week and you will be in a great long term position.
"Look for a break over $56 tomorrow, end of year over $60 with a decent guidance tomorrow morning.. should be a nice beat on the consensus EPS of .58c on revenue of $9.78B"
"I'm in my mid 60's... I have a retirement 401k, but I have $13,000 to invest / grow. I have 100% in AAPL.I am thinking to put 50% in KO. Then ride a while on 50 / 50 AAPL and KO with both reinvesting the divi.. My concern is to miss a nice ride with AAPL. Thoughts?"
