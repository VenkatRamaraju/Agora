"Hey Woke-A-Dopes the share holders of Coca Cola are not going to get rid of James Quincey , after all the man has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports ."
"So Howie, if the poor results drive down the stock price, are you guilty of securities fraud? Don’t run away from the question Howie? It makes you look bad!"
I'm going to the grocery store again today for our weekly shopping trip and guess what I won't be purchasing? Any product owned by KO. It's been months now since I stopped and it feels great! I don't miss any of it at all. Yeah!
"The soccer kid is no genius he just sold his NYC apartment for half of what he paidseveral years ago, lost 9 million, what would 9 mil. be worth in Coke stock now?"
I'll gladly drink ice cold coke all day to enhance my immune system over taking those deadly covid shots. Go KO!
It’s going down. I’m warning you to get out ahead of next earnings call. You’ll see...
"KO is a buy and hold stock, hello $60s"
"Another green day for Coca Cola stock , great dividend Stock , great corporate governance team , with a great CEO that has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports."
"( Poor Howie, you just don’t understand incremental sales particularly their impact on profit over and above break even do you? LOL!) You said that last OT Best , and Coca Cola beat earnings . Think I will go with the Institutions holding 69.43% of the shares , 26 analysts that rate the stock , 59 years of Dividend incress , and not with some right winger reporting fake news from his local Walmart."
"@howard, if you have even a sliver of an open mind, Google Vivek Ramaswamy , he will provide you with an AHA moment! After hearing Vivek you too will call for the KO ceo to resign! He’ll also convince you it’s not just KO! It’s the NBA, & others that are selling out the USA for China! If you have a closed mind then don’t bother!"
Buy below 56 dollars and hold for 25 years. Reap dividends.
"I didn't purchase any Coke products again today. And I have dumped all my shares months ago. I'm embarrassed for this once-great company, and i don't want a dime of any profits they may make."

We have bad luck. The fear should have waited another week...I hope the market won't drag us down too much.
LONG KO! Don't turn your back on a great American company!
I already sold most of my position...bracing for 50$ if covid is back and the spx will sell off.
"Consider that Coke is selling on discount! Incremental sales increases can raise stock prices. Likewise, decremental sales can lower stock prices. These are the facts despite what Howie says! The stock price is based on ALL sales not just restaurant sales."
@Howard doing this board a great service. If we’re woke for investing in coke. Thanks for sleeping on coke. When you see us over $60 with increasing dividends you’ll be buying in over $60….. you’ll shoot our shares up even higher.
"KO will have the same chart as BUD, when they got into politics down 47% last 5 years"
Professional soccer needs companies like Coca-Cola more than they need professional soccer. Best reign in you loose cannons.
"I feel sorry for Coke Employees, who have to work for a CEO that has insulted them AND half of America. Their CEO has made so many hate a company that used to be an American icon."
"IQ question for best!!!!!! Coca Cola is trading at 56.88 a share today , is that price closer to it's 52 week low of 46.97 or 52 week high of 57.56 ???????"
We gonna give the market a bigger surprise than Pepsi.
"52 week high, 52 week closing high on slightly elevated volume. I was expecting a bit more excitement."
"The market cap value of Coca-Cola dropped $4 billion today after Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo removed two bottles of the soft drink’s cola from the podium at his press conference. Ronaldo held up a water bottle instead proclaiming “agua.” Coca-Cola, one of the official sponsors of Euro Cup, replied on Tuesday with a statement that said ‘everyone is entitled to their drink preferences’ with different ‘tastes and needs.’"
Who's Renaldo? Labron's brother. So what?
Dumped this stock 3 months ago. Increase earnings on reduced sales doesn’t sound right. Sell..sell before bad news comes out. There’s a boycott on this woke company. Pepsi looks better.
Just buy on the dips you'll be fine!!!!!
Added more shares today cheers ronald 
"People think the soccer guy is gonna crash this, players come and go, Coke is here since1886."
Discount Coke sales DO NOT bode well for quarterly results even if they are incremental to “restaurant sales” as Howie claims! The discounted prices are due to reduced sales or otherwise why discount price?
i like the divvy but yikes...this stock takes moths to move a buck or 2
I would love to be able to add to my position below $50. Long KO!
"Keep the Coke boycott coming, ya dummies! It's having the exact opposite effect on the KO share price! We're steadily moving up to $60! Long KO! :)"
"Sold out of KO. Great dividend stock. Not so great for capital appreciation. May enter in again to capture dividends, but have lost faith in this CEO to move KO in positive direction as he is too caught up in politics. He should stick to running the business."
When's the next fake boycott?
"The left & Howie, so afraid of words in a post that they delete them! It must be miserable to live life so much in fear! Coke ceo must resign to save the company! Or is he only concerned about himself??"
"Top ten popular stocks that hedge funds are buying Apple Inc , Bank of America Corp , Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , American Express Company , Amazon Inc , Visa Inc , Charter Communications Inc , and The Coca Cola Company . So hedge funds are buying shares of Coca Cola is great news for stock owners , but not great news for best . I think best needs to call up all the Hedge fund mangers and tell them how the share price of Coca Cola is going to crash because his local Walmart is selling Coca Cola at half price . LOL !!!"
When you see all of these people come out of the woodwork to advise yo uto sell you know it means to buy more because they are afraid of the buying pressure.From a technical level KO broke out of the last 2 channels. The third time is when it won't drop again. We reach 57.50 and it's going to skyrocket to 60 by end of September at the latest.
"The Coke CEO is the Oren Boyle of modern day! In Atlas Shrugs, Oren is so busy fixing his “social justice causes” that he runs the business into the ground! KO don’t let that happen to you!"
I am glad to own KO. It is a very stable with sustained LONG term performance -a true dividend aristocrat for years and years! and very reliable especially for retirees! I do add every now and then when opportunity comes. I also believe KO will grow in the future.
"Just reminding Mr. Quincey that I am definitely NOT buying any Coke products. And if he needs a reason, he just needs to look in the mirror."
"This stock never rises ""slowly Gonzalez""..."
"Nice volume today , and the move up indicates that intentional investors are accumulating the Stock . Fun facts about Coca Cola earnings report , Yahoo list every earnings report going back to Jan. 1993 , and not one earnings report shows that Coca Cola lost money per share , all were positive earnings report . That is 27 and straight years . Great market leadership , great CEOs , and a great Stock for dividend investors ."
James Quincy deserves a big dose of appreciation. He is a world class leader .
Will be a buyer at the $54 mark.
"And America continues to spiral down, with no leadership.. How will that effect your investments, will your KO stock survive, how your other investments. I don't believe the America haters will allow us to keep our stocks and property..."
Look for Coke to increase the dividend again

"""Wokeness is many things. But increasingly it seems a cover for careerism, profiteering and utter incompetence.""Coke you better fix this before it is too late. And it is getting late."

"Second QT price movement on Coca Cola April 1 2021 52.51 to June 30 54.11 is a 3% gain is share price , and a dividend payout of .42 cents a share . More proof that the Woke-A-Dopes are a Joke ."
"Oil companies trying to be GREEN by investing in different energy sources, how could Coca Cola sell products with less sugar and chemicals?. Roland has the answer: water!."

"Just got back from dinner at Chick-fil-A place was packed , and people were still sucking down Coca Cola soda pop with their food . Then I stopped by Walgreen and just like Walmart Coca Cola was selling at full price in Walgreens , no wonder hedge funds are buying more shares of Coca Cola ."
"Wooglin,What are your thoughts on KO? Appears you may own PEP but not KO from your recent posts. I own both and PEP has been the better investment over the years but KO has also been good to me through dividend reinvestment. My average price per share is in the low/mid $30 range. Have a great weekend!"
"I sincerely wish good luck to anyone that is investing in KO. I simply cannot understand why anyone would. If you were considering buying a home that had tons of cracks in the foundation and there were hundreds of other homes to choose from that didn't, why would you buy it? Howard, I know that you're already feverishly typing up some kind of discombobulated response becuase someone is saying something negative about KO. No need. Everyone knows you're KO's biggest fan. And trust me, what happens with KO will have nothing to do with a convo on yahoo."
Cristiano Ronaldo removed CocaCola bottles from press conference table at the Euros. Possible market downturn ?

Shepard did a bit last night on Pepsi coming out with that disgusting mountain dew drink. He mentioned coca cola already had a seltzer called topo Chico. A lot of people still don't know about it and it's an extremely popular brand for those that do. It is the best tasting one on the market. Higher priced too so better margins.With this CEO I assure you they will dabble into cbd drinks once it's legalized or at least invest in a company. Coca cola is conservative and waiting on legalization. That is where the growth sector for this company will come from.
Sweet earnings beat.
"Coca Cola Analyst ratings strong buy !!!!! Analyst firms making recommendations are B OF A GLBL RES , COWEN & COMPANY , DEUTSCHE BK SEC , EDWARD JONES , JEFFERIES & CO. , JP MORGAN SECUR , MORGAN STANLEY , TRUIST SECURITI V.S. the WOKE-A-DOPES Strong Sell!!!!!

Ko gonna fly now 
The volume has been light since July which is positive for a price decline. Expect a monster rebound in the next couple weeks.
Ko to $60.00
it is SGA expenses is 19%companies should keep between 30% and 80% to be durable.
FACT:I have been buying KO shares since September of last year. The XIRR of my KO investment is 15%. Not bad.
"Fun Fact Best!!!!!! In 1972 Pepsi became the first U.S. company to sell products in the Soviet Union , only problem Soviet rubles were worthless internationally, with their value determined by the Kremlin . So Pepsi resorted to barter. In return for cola, Pepsi received Stolichnaya vodka to distribute in the United States. By the late 1980s, Russians were drinking approximately a billion servings of Pepsi a year. But by 1988 a boycott in response to the Soviet-Afghan war made the Pepsi for vodka not such a great deal . So in the spring of 1989, Pepsi and the Soviet Union signed a new deal for 17 old submarines and three warships, including a frigate, a cruiser, and a destroyer, which made Pepsi the 6th largest military in the world for a little time , until they sold the Ships for scrap. Fun fact It also ignited jokes that Pepsi was taking the Cola Wars to the high seas. We’re disarming the Soviet Union faster than you are, Pepsi CEO Kendall quipped to Brent Scowcroft, President George H.W. Bush’s national security adviser."

Tell me how a boycott works again?
"Hey Woke-A-Dopes???? Boy Coca Cola is up nice today , can you tell us your next boycott we love making money!!!!"
"You gotta hand it to KO, it’s hardly made a dent in the price. Elon made negative remarks about $BTC and crypto fell 50% LOL"
I have owned considerable KO and PEP for decades. In 5 years PEP is up 41%. KO is up 23%. KO pays only a slightly better div. I see a better future for PEP. I will keep them both…. Coke’s CEO should stay out of politics.
$DUOT is a better play IMO
whats the difference between $KO and $COKE ?
"the younger generation are not drinking sodas such as coke, pepsi, etc, , my sisters, nephew, and my son does not allow their kids to drink soda at all.KO is doing ok for now, but in the next decade or two, they may not doing as good as they're now."
I dislike this brand it's unhealthy products. Wish everyone would short it to oblivion
$60 by October! Long KO!!!!!
"Sell KO, buy MMNFF"
"What an amazing company to pull off these numbers!! These numbers come despite, a perceived “ban” for being too “woke”. Not taking sides, I’m on the side that makes me the most money. But something to ponder!"
You need to understand that 66% of Coke’s net revenue came from outside US in 2020.
Touche' Rolando! Keep up the good work!
"IQ test for the Woke -A-Dopes!!!!!! What is the higher price for shares in Coca Cola!!!!! last years 06-15-2020 close of $46.02 , or todays 06-15-2021 close of $55.41 ????"
Way to go KO!
Woke Cola...Hey I like Pepsi in my 3 restaurants!
"History has repeated it's self !!!!! Just like the America the Beautiful boycott of 2014 Coca Cola has beat earnings today . Coca Cola is a great dividend stock , with a great CEO running the company."
"KO will trade by the end of the at $ 75, start your engine investors."
I told y’all KO would crank up!! Now let’s sit back and enjoy the run up boisssssss
"The Coke Company used to be an American icon. What a shame that a woke CEO has turned it into a political platform that tries to bully state legislatures. Even it's own employees are treated as racists. Like others, I won't purchase Coke."
KO beat EPS the last 4 Qtrs. I am getting tired of winning so much!
"How does coke/soda continue to grow? As soda becomes less popular? Serious question, Enlighten me."
baller’s actions wiped $4bn of Coca-Cola’s market capitalisation
TO THE MOON!
"This is gonna be one of the most anticipated ""reopening"" earning report coming up for our previous slow moving stock KO. Lots of eyes, lots of expectations, upcoming articles... lots of attention..lots of buyers. There no other reopening stock with the insane global market reach and solid fundamentals like KO. The expectations of all of the recovery stocks will be be adjusted accordingly after they report. I am Bullish personally."

Holy buckets! Great earnings and guidance by KO baby!
I can't wait for earning...I'm betting in outpacing the spx for a while due to that.
"Rolando did not like Coca Cola, replacing it with water. What will happen if all the athletes turn on the soft drink companies? No ads with superstar athletes?"
Germany  put 4 goals against Portugal  You should have drunk more water bruh  Go Coca Cola! 
Hey best the Coca Cola Analyst ratings post is 100% true .
"KO up today following PEP's coat tails, I might have to place a safety down limit sale.."
"Boy how did I miss this one?????? The Zacks Research Aug 30th Shares of Coca-Cola have outperformed the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry over the past year (+12.4% vs. +11.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that shares of Coca-Cola outpaced the industry in the past year, thanks to its robust earnings surprise trend that continued in second-quarter 2021. This marked the seventh straight quarter of earnings beats and its second consecutive sales beat.The company’s top line bounced back from the decline witnessed in the prior-year quarter, mainly owing to the increased consumer mobility and reopening of economies in several regions, which led to increased away-from-home channel sales. Revenues reflected gains from improved price/mix, an increase in concentrate sales and higher unit case volume.The company is poised to gain from accelerating investments to expand its digital presence. However, the company witnessed pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs. It witnessed higher marketing spends compared with the prior-year quarter. But Best wants you to think the share price of Coca Cola are going to crash because his ( Wink!! Wink!!) Walmart is selling it at half price ."
"Yahoo is asking how I am feeling about KO. The answer is that I'm not feeling too good about it, given that Mr. Quincey is still in charge, and given that he has turned many life long Coke drinkers, like me, away from Coke products."
I'm a little disappointed in the price action after such a nice report. Why did this not hold the earnings pop?
"A bit of history on Coke.During WW2 the company with the cooperation of the US Army made sure the productwas available to all US service persons world wide, temp. bottling plants were set up globally .2 Coke executives were killed during the war.A bit of history on Portugal ( the soccer player's home country )During WW2 they were neutral until 1944 , then only entering as a non belligerent entity( that means they didn't fight the Germans ) . Just FYI"
so if we hold shares by September 15 we get the dividend payout?
"KO will never go over $60. I guess I'll just hold for the dividend. But, it would be nice to see it move a little more"
1% after hours...there is someone in the know know..
"People will forget who Ronaldo is when the cruise, bars and parks will open with full swing. Kids are born with Coke bottle in their mouth."
Going all in at $50. I am very patient
KO is going down. Get out while you are in profit.
Long $KO! One of the great American companies!
Sell the news and then get back in.
"I got to tell you that KO is the worst I ever held. I think that Pepsi, MSFT, SPY are much better. I bet that Pepsi will over power KO in market cap soon. There are just too many sellers killing every pump, I don't think the price will break 60$ anytime soon. Pepsi is reaching all time highs."
I see this story out of a different lens. Here you have one of the largest companies in the world that has been around for over 129 years sponsoring a venue as they always do putting up some good coin and a couple of $1 cokes on the table and you have who pretty much is one of the top 2 if not top player in the world today saying he doesn't like it.. drink water. This video has gone viral around the world today at least 5 billion people have heard the story or seen the video. Who do you think got the better shake here.? Coke lately has been aggressive in getting sound bites this one landed right on their lap. They knew he doesn't drink the stuff. Why even offer it then?.lol..I'm quite sure on a side bar they will be reminding fifa/Euro that Coke has been around before anyone on earth now and will be around when everyone on earth now is gone so if they pay big money to sponsor.. the pop stays where they put it. Have a great day. $2worth of pop billions in exposure. hmmm

"Selling KO and buying AFL. A big reason why? See below. I prefer a wise CEO over a ""woke"" CEO.The corporate uproar over laws that restrict voting access reached a fever pitch in Georgia, in March, when Atlanta-based giants Delta (DAL) and Coca-Cola (COKE) condemned a measure enacted by Gov. Brian Kemp after the companies faced pressure from activist groups.But a number of major Georgia-based companies passed up the opportunity to comment directly on the law that critics say disenfranchises Black voters, including Aflac (AFL), headquartered in Columbus, Georgia. In a new interview, Aflac CEO Dan Amos said the company doesn't seek to intervene publicly on divisive political issues like the voting law. Instead, the company strives to address racial justice by achieving diversity and fair treatment within its workforce, he said.""Whenever you get involved, you're going to make half the people upset — and it would be half your workers, half your policyholders, half of everything,"" says Amos, who has led the company since 1990. ""We believe that let the politics fall where they may,"" he adds. Implying that minorities are too stupid to obtain an ID is highly offensive."
"What a great earnings report for Coca Cola it beat wall street expectations by 20.78% . James Quincey became Coca Cola CEO in December 2016 , and this is his 19th earnings report ,17 earnings reports have beat wall street expectations . What a great CEO and company to invest in ."
KO down on an up day! Hmm?
Another day of the shorts being wrong.
What is happening!! This may end negative today.
"Dow and KO in strong divergence. Interesting. We all know that KO insiders, family, and friends, would never quitely start dumping before what they know might be a horrific earnings report. Nah. Would NEVER happen. ;-)"
"( Buffet's stock portfolio remains highly concentrated in a handful of companies. In Q2, 69% of its aggregate value was in Apple (AAPL) ($124.3 billion) and Bank of America (BAC) ($42.6 billion). Also, American Express (AXP) ($25.1 billion), and Coca-Cola (KO) ($21.6 billion).) So Buffet owns 21.6 billion of Coca Cola stock , we will know if Buffet sold any shares of Coca Cola when the 2 OT 13-F comes out in the next few days that will give an in depth look into assets Berkshire bought and sold during the second quarter."

"Three World problems: obesity, plastic pollution and personnel debt. Don't invest in companies that hurt! Stay away from KO,MO and credit card companies that bury Americans in debt. Liberal activist like Taylor Swift, pretends to care about the little guy, while pushing Capitol One credit cards to her young fans.Top reason for suicide is money problems thanks Swift! Don't be part of the problem."
"Topo Chico hard seltzer is going to drive growth for this company. It's the best hard seltzer, doesn't taste like chemicals like the other brands do.They sold out instantly the month they came out and are still moving. I am in Texas but recently saw Bachelorette parties in another state drinking them. It's going to spread like wild fire nationwide."
"It was my first 4th of July in decades without a COKE in my hand. As their former #1 fan, it's a pity. I will always support someone's right to their own opinion and speak up for it. But I will NEVER support a CEO who tries to speak his own opinion on behalf of an entire ""public"" corporation and bully people or states. And I will never support a CEO who treats people of certain races differently than those of other races, or implies that they are guilty of a crime because of their skin color."
"EUAFA/FIFA should muzzle their dog. It's embarrassing that yet again, another entitled athlete thinks he can be disrespectful to one of the companies that helps pay his exorbitant salary. It's a good thing Coke sells water too (Dasani) to throw at the pouty prima donna."

Maybe you can replace Rudy Giuliani who had his law license suspended in N.Y. and D.C. , your are one of America's top lawyer right????"
KO sells water too lol.
The ONLY stock in my portfolio that isn't back to the pre-pandemic crash price.
KOKO going down. Now is the time to sell.
"I wanna buy KO, but when?"
"All the people on here bashing Coca-Cola are in essence, rooting for a great American company to fail. By definition, that's anti-American. I want Coca-Cola to succeed. Coca-Cola is like like the fourth of July, apple pie and Superman. Think about what you're saying. Long KO."
"i bought some $KO today. however, im curious, as a white man, is $PEP a safe investment?"
geez that was a tough boycott
It's been over 2 months since I purchased any COKE product. Too bad Coke (CEO Quincey) didn't care about their like long customers. Politics and Wokeness was more important.
"If KO crashes because of Ronaldo, I'm moving my capital to Bitcoin. at least there the potential rewards are greater."
Coke is king. Addictive product that people buy hand over fist.
"Knock it off with the blind optimism. The company has solid financials and they are pivoting towards healthier drinks, they have the distribution to make this pivot easily. It’s silly to ignore Ronaldo’s comment today, health is a valid criticism of Coca Cola. Other people feel the same way. Vitamin water is growing and is doing a good job reaching the millennial generation, but let me tell you traditional Coca Cola will not be this company’s best selling product in the next decade."
Just left Popeyes and people were drinking Pepsi products while enjoying their great chicken! Howie try their chicken & a Pepsi. You’ll be amazed!
KO will likely cut dividend like Ford to push for growth
"Fun Facts about Coca Cola !!!! Approximately 96% of the world’s population recognizes the Coca-Cola logo , and sells 1.8 billion bottles per day .

Going for our weekly grocery shopping again today and guess what we WON'T be buying YET AGAIN? Any product owned by KO. Don't miss it and enjoy making SURE we know of every product they own and steer clear of it. Ha ha!
Big breakout coming
is the market seriously going to react to one person's opinion? the company sells more than just coke people! drink water Ronaldo says? the Coca-Cola company can sell you water.
who thinks there will be good news coming out of KOs earnings call? i hope itll push this stock over 60.... long term holder
"Nice quarter, increase outlook 2021, ""2021 will better than 2019""; got to love it."
Let's take a moment to thank all the generous coke shorts who are going to paying our dividends next week :D
KO will reach 60 by the end of September!

James Quincey worst CEO in CocaColas history. Can’t fulfill orders for 3 weeks now at my restaurants short CocaCola till he’s fired.
I see that MR. CEO Quincey is still with Coke. Coke deserves better leadership than that. Please let me know when he's gone. Only then will I (and many others) consider drinking Coke again.
"Just a reminder that many of us have left Coke products, due to MR. CEO Quincey, and his ""personal"" Political and Racial opinions that he feels that he can dictate on behalf of ALL of his Stockholders, Employees, and the entire Coke company."
wow and I bought coca cola 2 liters today
"( Like I said, Howie doesn’t have a clue other than ignoring the obvious! Why are Coke products selling at 50% off?BOGO?) LOL!!!! Ya right like I pointed out yesterday most of Coca Cola earnings in the United States come from 200 Restrunts that serve Coca Cola drinks , that would include 22 of Americas fast food restrunts . Only 35% of Coca Cola earnings come from the United States , 65% from the rest of the World ,something you or any investor would know just by picking up an earnings report . So who do I belive Best who is telling us his Wal Mart is selling Coca Cola at at 50% off , or someone like Warren Buffett 10 Best Stocks to Buy with Coca Cola coming at number 4 . ( The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company. It is placed fourth on our list of 10 best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. Latest data shows that Berkshire Hathaway owned 400 million shares in the beverage maker at the end of June 2021. These are worth $21.6 billion and represent 7.38% of the investment portfolio of the Buffett-led company? Think I will go with Buffett!!!! Never trust someone posting on the internet trying to scare you into selling your shares of Coca Cola based on a trip to his local Wal Mart!!!"
"This board deletes posts, its been nice, but I am not going to play a rigged game. EVERYONE should be against this kind of Censorship. I did not say anything that is not true or call anyone names. Those of you that think this is OK, your wrong. Thanks it has been fun."
Awesome !!! awaken the giant !!!
First we hit $60 then we rise to steadily to $100. KO is too attractive as a dividend stock to be consolidating in the $50s
"After the CEO Resigns due to lost customers and poor SP!Along with KO’s promise not to push their left wing politics in the future, KO may be a buying opportunity! But not until then!"
"IQ question for the Woke-A-Dopes Coca Cola share price low after the COVID 19 market melt down was on March 20 2020 at $37.51 . Today's close of $54.95 is a 46.4% incress in share price , and a Dividend payout of $2.07 , is this a good or bad price movement ?????"
What's the problem now? We headed back to 51?
"PEP was down the same 2% , it's the 530 drop in the DOW, not the Soccer player."
I’ve noticed Coke on sale buy one 12 pack get one free. I also noticed that Pepsi use to be at a price discount to Coke! No more! Consider what this says about Coke sales! Then do what you think is BEST! Even Howie!

"80% of America wants voter ID, only those that want to cheat don't. KO backs the 20%."
This company has gone nowhere with this woke CEO.
Cmon Monday....KO!! ROCKNROLL
Pepsi CEO reports increased market share from Coke. I wonder if woke behavior is partly to blame..?
im white. is this a safe investment for me? or will i receive less dividends than a minority.
KO seems to get a lot of grief for not being a high flying stock.But i did some basic math and over the course of the last five years it has averaged just over 8% per year. That is nice safe money in my opinion and a great way to build slow wealth.
"IQ question for best!!!!!! What is the higher stock price Jan 1 2021 at 52.76 , or todays price of 56.81 ?????"

I hope the boycotters see all over Fox coke still smashed estimates despite their boycott. It’s probably just fake news to them though
"I also never found discount prices on any of the other Coca Cola drinks like Sprite , Fanta , Schweppes , Minute Maid , Dasani , and Monster energy drinks were selling at full price . But Best wants you to think that Coca Cola stock price is going to crash because his local Walmart is selling Coca Cola Classic at half price ,Ya right LOL!!!!! Oh and I just got back from lunch at Firehouse Subs , place was packed with people eating sub sandwiches and sucking down Coca Cola soda pop."
Yet Morningstar rates KO neutral! There are Better places for your money. Using the average over the first 6 months may hide the declining sales month over month. Be wary of the politics of the CEO!
"Boy the Woke-A-Dope protesters are getting desperate!!!!! In the wee early hours of the morning 12 Woke-A-Dope protesters chained themselves to the doors of a local Chick-fil-A , in hopes of stopping people from buying Coca Cola soda pop .

Took a bit of time , but the Chick-fil-A did just fine , the drive threw window was doing a huge business ."

Possible stock split coming?.

"Just got back from lunch at Steak 'n Shake's love the Frisco Melt , place was doing a nice business , and everybody was filling up with Coca Cola soda pop ."
"It is with great sadness, that while I am NOT watching the All Star Game, I have just sold all my holdings in ""Woke-a Cola"". I am sure they will do fine without me, as I will them.

The slow but steady ride to retirement with Coca-Cola stock.
"Go into Walgreens or CVS and empty shelves of Coke,asked an employee and they said coke has a driver shortage.Why are they covering this up?"
"LOL Lenny from the Motley Fool !!!!!! Coca-Cola's dividend yield is 3.2%, more than double the S&P 500's 1.5% yield. That's certainly another point in the company's favor.Do these factors add up to a great dividend stock? Considering the company's long-standing commitment to raising dividends, even amid the latest challenges, strong free cash flow, and a higher yield than the overall market, the answer is a resounding yes. For those of you wishing to buy a dividend-paying stock, Coca-Cola is an excellent choice."
"The dividend will be distributed tomorrow, the big OG holders will reinvest it."
Zero growth and a 33 PE ratio. Why would anyone want to own the company? So many better companies. They’ve destroyed their brand pushing racist propaganda while promoting sugar water to our youth— creating a type 2 diabetic crisis and serving up chemical imitation sweeteners by the billions of gallons causing who knows what Heath calamities that have yet to be in covered.
"Nice earnings beat by IBM today , the Stock was up $5.08 or 3.68% in AH , watch Coca Cola do the same thing on the Wednesday."
last week was a bad week for my stocks. Thinking about buying in for earnings. Anyone have thoughts on how earnings should go this week?
"Just your friendly reminder that my family and I pass right by EVERY coca cola product in the stores now because we will NEVER EVER purchase anything this company owns. The amazing thing about this is, it's unreal how many other non-coke products there are out there. Did you know there are literally 1000's of private labeled soda companies that offer some of the tastiest awesome soda you've ever had? Funny enough I tried a private label rootbeer the other day and it was unbelievably delicious, so much better than anything I've ever had from coke or other big name brands. Anywho this is a permanent thing for us and millions like us, they pushed it TOO FAR this time, they should've checked themselves but they didn't, now they're going to pay for that forever.Coca cola made itself an enemy of millions of Americans and others around the world with their egregious racism and that's going to cost them so much more than their arrogant leftist university indoctrinated management is capable of understanding in their democRat bubble of superiority, but they'll see the ""numbers"" soon enough and the DECLINING sales.Thanks."
Blow out earnings and up an amazing .75 cents. What was the price of this stock in 3 years ago....incredible returns. The only thing this stock has upside on is your chance of getting diabetes if you consume their products!

"Major League Baseball's All-Star Game was once ""appointment viewing"" in this country. In 1980, more than 36 million people tuned in. In 2015, in the age of interleague play, a still-respectable 11 million watched the American and National Leagues battle it out. But for Tuesday night's game, the Nielsen numbers were profoundly horrible: 8.24 million people tuned in, making it the second-least-watched All-Star Game in history."
"Had a massive 4th of July party yesterday at an HOA complex my buddy lives in, he saw to it that zero KO products were available for all the folks. We had plenty of other options, tons of different sodas and sparkling flavored waters etc, tons of drinks and mixers but NO Coke products. Yes!"

"WOW!!! Another up Day for Coca Cola nice price action the last 3 days!!!!! What the Woke-A-Dopes don't understand is Nielsen claims that “the U.S. television industry is entering a period of prolonged structural decline,” due to consumers moving away from traditional commercial TV to streaming services with no, or fewer, commercials. With MLB allstar game there are six major streaming providers that offer Live TV Streaming. Five of these providers allow you to watch the 2021 MLB All-Star Game live . Fact is Major League Baseball TV and YouTube TV lets you watch game being played all over the U.S.A. that you would never be able to watch on local T.V."
"As we celebrated the 4th of July, I was especially sad for all those Coke employees who have a CEO that thinks that many of them are guilty of a crime - just because of their skin color. How unpatriotic is that!"

Toyotas’ CEO was perfect in his response! Even the US SUPREME COURT HAS RULED 6-3 that the voter ID LAWS & fraud prevention measures are Legal! The KO CEO is on the wrong side on this issue! He along with other weak, wimpy CEO’s need to grow a set!"
"Since Coke's CEO steered them into Politics, misrepresented facts, and told his employees of certain colors that they had to go through special training to learn how NOT to act that color, I am STAYING AWAY from all Coke products."
"OK strong close today, if the market is green tomorrow, for some reason, we gonna see all time highs. We will probably see a beat on earnings and revenue + raising guidance. The only problem is the market sentiment. We should do better than the spx anyway."
Of stocks I expected to fall coke wasn't on that list. Is anyone buying less coke due to covid?
