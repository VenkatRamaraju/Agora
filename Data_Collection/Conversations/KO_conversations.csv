"Nice quarter, increase outlook 2021, ""2021 will better than 2019""; got to love it."
"How does coke/soda continue to grow? As soda becomes less popular? Serious question, Enlighten me."
"IQ question for best!!!!!! Coca Cola is trading at 56.88 a share today , is that price closer to it's 52 week low of 46.97 or 52 week high of 57.56 ???????"
Just buy on the dips you'll be fine!!!!!
I’ve noticed Coke on sale buy one 12 pack get one free. I also noticed that Pepsi use to be at a price discount to Coke! No more! Consider what this says about Coke sales! Then do what you think is BEST! Even Howie!
When you see all of these people come out of the woodwork to advise yo uto sell you know it means to buy more because they are afraid of the buying pressure.From a technical level KO broke out of the last 2 channels. The third time is when it won't drop again. We reach 57.50 and it's going to skyrocket to 60 by end of September at the latest.
I already sold most of my position...bracing for 50$ if covid is back and the spx will sell off.
"Another green day for Coca Cola stock , great dividend Stock , great corporate governance team , with a great CEO that has beat wall street expectations in 17 out of 19 earnings reports."
Shepard did a bit last night on Pepsi coming out with that disgusting mountain dew drink. He mentioned coca cola already had a seltzer called topo Chico. A lot of people still don't know about it and it's an extremely popular brand for those that do. It is the best tasting one on the market. Higher priced too so better margins.With this CEO I assure you they will dabble into cbd drinks once it's legalized or at least invest in a company. Coca cola is conservative and waiting on legalization. That is where the growth sector for this company will come from.
"What a great earnings report for Coca Cola it beat wall street expectations by 20.78% . James Quincey became Coca Cola CEO in December 2016 , and this is his 19th earnings report ,17 earnings reports have beat wall street expectations . What a great CEO and company to invest in ."
Going all in at $50. I am very patient
"( Poor Howie, you just don’t understand incremental sales particularly their impact on profit over and above break even do you? LOL!) You said that last OT Best , and Coca Cola beat earnings . Think I will go with the Institutions holding 69.43% of the shares , 26 analysts that rate the stock , 59 years of Dividend incress , and not with some right winger reporting fake news from his local Walmart."
i like the divvy but yikes...this stock takes moths to move a buck or 2
"Top ten popular stocks that hedge funds are buying Apple Inc , Bank of America Corp , Microsoft Corp , Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc , American Express Company , Amazon Inc , Visa Inc , Charter Communications Inc , and The Coca Cola Company . So hedge funds are buying shares of Coca Cola is great news for stock owners , but not great news for best . I think best needs to call up all the Hedge fund mangers and tell them how the share price of Coca Cola is going to crash because his local Walmart is selling Coca Cola at half price . LOL !!!"
Buy below 56 dollars and hold for 25 years. Reap dividends.
KO will reach 60 by the end of September!
I would love to be able to add to my position below $50. Long KO!
"I didn't purchase any Coke products again today. And I have dumped all my shares months ago. I'm embarrassed for this once-great company, and i don't want a dime of any profits they may make."
"( Like I said, Howie doesn’t have a clue other than ignoring the obvious! Why are Coke products selling at 50% off?BOGO?) LOL!!!! Ya right like I pointed out yesterday most of Coca Cola earnings in the United States come from 200 Restrunts that serve Coca Cola drinks , that would include 22 of Americas fast food restrunts . Only 35% of Coca Cola earnings come from the United States , 65% from the rest of the World ,something you or any investor would know just by picking up an earnings report . So who do I belive Best who is telling us his Wal Mart is selling Coca Cola at at 50% off , or someone like Warren Buffett 10 Best Stocks to Buy with Coca Cola coming at number 4 . ( The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a Georgia-based beverage company. It is placed fourth on our list of 10 best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. Latest data shows that Berkshire Hathaway owned 400 million shares in the beverage maker at the end of June 2021. These are worth $21.6 billion and represent 7.38% of the investment portfolio of the Buffett-led company? Think I will go with Buffett!!!! Never trust someone posting on the internet trying to scare you into selling your shares of Coca Cola based on a trip to his local Wal Mart!!!"
The ONLY stock in my portfolio that isn't back to the pre-pandemic crash price.
The volume has been light since July which is positive for a price decline. Expect a monster rebound in the next couple weeks.
"The Coke CEO is the Oren Boyle of modern day! In Atlas Shrugs, Oren is so busy fixing his “social justice causes” that he runs the business into the ground! KO don’t let that happen to you!"
"Consider that Coke is selling on discount! Incremental sales increases can raise stock prices. Likewise, decremental sales can lower stock prices. These are the facts despite what Howie says! The stock price is based on ALL sales not just restaurant sales."
"KO is a buy and hold stock, hello $60s"
The slow but steady ride to retirement with Coca-Cola stock.
$60 by October! Long KO!!!!!
Yet Morningstar rates KO neutral! There are Better places for your money. Using the average over the first 6 months may hide the declining sales month over month. Be wary of the politics of the CEO!
What is the board's take on KO being a sponsor of the 2022 Beijing Olympics?
"And America continues to spiral down, with no leadership.. How will that effect your investments, will your KO stock survive, how your other investments. I don't believe the America haters will allow us to keep our stocks and property..."
pepsi up 1.4% and KO 0.4%!
"Definitely not selling, buying more if it dips for COVID, will be huge opportunity. SPY is red today so might be just a bad day."
"KO will never go over $60. I guess I'll just hold for the dividend. But, it would be nice to see it move a little more"
When will they buy Monster and Body armour?
"Yahoo is asking how I am feeling about KO. The answer is that I'm not feeling too good about it, given that Mr. Quincey is still in charge, and given that he has turned many life long Coke drinkers, like me, away from Coke products."
"( Buffet's stock portfolio remains highly concentrated in a handful of companies. In Q2, 69% of its aggregate value was in Apple (AAPL) ($124.3 billion) and Bank of America (BAC) ($42.6 billion). Also, American Express (AXP) ($25.1 billion), and Coca-Cola (KO) ($21.6 billion).) So Buffet owns 21.6 billion of Coca Cola stock , we will know if Buffet sold any shares of Coca Cola when the 2 OT 13-F comes out in the next few days that will give an in depth look into assets Berkshire bought and sold during the second quarter."
Long $KO! One of the great American companies!
"WOW!!!! Coca-Cola Consolidated Reports Second Quarter and First Half 2021 Results just came out !!!!! Second quarter of 2021 net sales increased 17% versus the second quarter of 2020, second quarter of 2021 income from operations was $121 million, up $38 million, or 45%, versus the second quarter of 2020 , and Income from operations for the first half of 2021 was $215 million, up $99 million, or 86%, versus the first half of 2020 . COKE Stock was up $5.90 in regular trading , and up $2.19 in AH . Another solid earnings report out of a great American company named Coca Cola ."
"IQ question for best!!!!!! What is the higher stock price Jan 1 2021 at 52.76 , or todays price of 56.81 ?????"
"@howard, if you have even a sliver of an open mind, Google Vivek Ramaswamy , he will provide you with an AHA moment! After hearing Vivek you too will call for the KO ceo to resign! He’ll also convince you it’s not just KO! It’s the NBA, & others that are selling out the USA for China! If you have a closed mind then don’t bother!"
