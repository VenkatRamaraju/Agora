Of course UHC is a better company but if it were not for ACHC huge mistake in the UK Acquisition taking on $3B in debt ACHC would be trading $150.

I think it’s a buying opportunity
The debt due to UK acquisition still haunting this company
"PHILADELPHIA, March 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaskela Law LLC announces that it is investigating Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACHC) (“Acadia” or the “Company”) on behalf of the long-term Acadia stockholders.Recently an amended shareholder class action complaint was filed against Acadia on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018. According to the amended complaint, during that time period the “defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud and made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors regarding Acadia’s business and operations,” including by falsely stating that: (i) offering quality care was of fundamental importance to Acadia’s business model, and that its facilities provided high-quality care that would drive Acadia’s success; (ii) Acadia adequately staffed its facilities to ensure its ability to provide appropriate care to patients; (iii) Acadia’s facilities were in compliance with relevant regulatory requirements; and (iv) Acadia’s U.K. operations would achieve substantial revenue and earnings growth in the face of nursing shortages and negative media reports about the Company’s operations.The investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Acadia’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct."

2.0 consensus a Hold rating however many insiders have sold. Just enough to pay the payroll and debt. CEO DID A NICE job but
lock down a big JV and announce it!! c'mon guys get it together....help the shareholders.....you all got out at 51.5....that was sneeky...in a secondary only offered from insiders.....your actually lucky there isn't a law suit over that....cause correct me if i'm wrong but you had an idea about the 3rd q miss when you sold? that's illegal....but you snuck one by them congrat's

i got to tell the board sitting in a hot tube in Mesa AZ i met a heathcare worker from midwest on vacation working in UK. UK lacks healthcare skills. so for the lack thereof this stock sinks. i wanted to ask her salary whatever it brought her out of retirement.
Investors trying to buy at the bottom. Get fooled every time. Debt ridden for years to come
I think this has to do with short seller Marc Cohodes referencing ACHC and retweeting his pal AureliusValue regarding ACHC. Volume and chart lines up with his tweets. Aurelius is short ACHC. Cohodes is not clear but wields the bigger stick. I bought on the weakness. I'm sure Jacobs will be asked during the Credit Suisse meeting tomorrow
$3.37B in debt everybody's brother trying to get investors to buy into this debt.
hard to believe this was trading at over 70 2 1/2 years ago.
The UK ACQUISITION GOT THE CEO FIRED. A lawsuit is pending. Based on what investors are seeing today this should be trading $100 right now. I for one investor impressed with the new CEO
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 45.23
After 5 years I am in the green. Tighten my stop this time. You never know when a CEO and Directors are going to acquire where the workforce doesn’t exist. The new CEO very high marks but in my opinion the Directors should be gone to.
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 39.82

Osteen please help
6 analysts are on STRONG BUY while Argus is bearish with a $55 target.
74 to 26 CEO is out who led the company to Globalism into the UK. I just have a feeling a political move....somebody phoned him somebody cause at this level HE knew the UK did not have the workforce to support the move. I happened to meet a mental health pro at a 55+ retirement community. The salary was so huge she came out of retirement.

10 years of paying back the debt caused by the UK expansion. I remember the fired CEO said I DID NOTHING WRONG. Now we learn it going to take 10 years to pay back the debt
17 x 2.85 (2019 earnings) = 48.50 will head that way toward August- Sept (when companies begin to trade on future's years earnings- 17X 2.48 (2018 earnings) is around 42.50 16x is about 40 so its around fair value now-
UHS earnings call included management comments about strong demand for behavioral healthNot unlikely ACHC is seeing same
was the aquisition in the UK worth it?
Next hurdle the lawsuit. ACHC will lose it the litigation and fines TBD. Only investors will be hurt. Minus the UK DEBACLE WOULD BE TRADING OVER $100 a share
Zacks had this a strong buy just before it’s UK move. So it could surprise investors again. The same mgmt and directors continue. Today trading over target along with huge debt. Not avg down for me. Mgmt a gambler attitude

Zacks had this a strong buy at 68 fell like a rock after the UK Debacle today a buy after losing most of its value. Zack evaluation is void of due diligence knowing 0 about the companies UK expansion. Another could be just around the corner
I hope SEC is watching to see if the fired CEO made some $ back on loan fees. the UK move made no sense

Poor Greg.......stuck shorting a stock that has done nothing but reach 52 week highs day after day. Also nothing but analyst upgrades. Lol
lawsuite needs to be expanded.
no upgrades leading into earnings. then touting record breaking earnings. Does not bode well for rising stock price.
5 year slide into the Abyss thanks to Zacks
target dropped to 40
$73 target let’s go. The $ rolling in paying debt and adding value thanks to the new CEO
mgmt destroyed the company
Hey Greg......how are you feeling now? You've been bashing this stock non stop to support your short position. Are you waiting for $60 a share to cover ROFLMFAO
national debt of UK 88% of GDP
bonuses all around globalism policy crashed this company
74 to 24. whats the payout for the ousted CEO?
43 to 41 target
Looks like 1 fund decided to dump their shares. 7% down was ridiculous given neutral earnings. If you look at earnings from a currency neutral perspective they look much better.
Should climb after call tomorrow morning
This is an over reaction ....... CEO is still on the board. She just retired from CEO position. She will still have a major influence on the company.
Moody CREDIT NEGATIVE

"Hey Greg....ACHC future is ""worrisome "" for you? Take a look at the 1 year chart. They apparently know what they are doing."
"By the way I bought small positions in 5 Zacks STRONG BUYS. All today in the red, needing $68 to be in the money. I then Googled stock picker success rates and found Zacks and Cramer are dead last among pro’s at 50%."

What happens? ACHC melts down like ice.
"Just remember Zacks has only a 50% stock picker success rate, you can Google that. Zacks has always hyped this company all the way down."
Why the big drop today?
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 50.92
projection lowered...on with the lawsuit.
Insiders selling more then buying in the $60 range so the future for me is worrisome
They are bringing a few new quality people onto their team. Futures of behavioral health is bright.
$70 to $54 Argus bought and paid for

$34 in a year 5 more back to $70. So how many years to right the UK wrong. A decade
Not so much time left to buy before it never returns to the current level ~$31
$75.00 next stop
Great news I have been stating for sometime now the Directors voted to acquire and make the UK move. That act drove the stock to $12 nearly destroying the company. The Directors are weak and should all go years ago. Five years of recognizing the failure and paying back the debt. Be careful the management can destroy it again.
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 46.89
mental illness is soaring. achc is expanding. stock has taken a little hit for no reason.the wind as at their back and the sell side is all quiet. love the setup.
Short sellers destroy company’s stock
Blackstone came out said BEXIT hurting growth. so achc directors and ceo certainly did not know what the UK acquisition was going to do with equity 70 to 30s. amazing failure
wonder how much the company paid Zacks for the Strong Buy at 70.

"81 to 29 in 2 1/2 years. How does that happen? I understand acquisitions but one that totally implodes the company and investors. Then they paid themselves bonuses. Destroying 64% of the company, once was a Zacks strong buy"
Be careful here A day after I bought mgmt acquired a move into UK. That imploded. Still paying off the debt.
any work on the losses in the UK? where did they make up for it.
10 analysts buy to strong buy but in sector ache rates a 22 sector 47. So why would 10 analysts rate this so high?
supposedly this is the last quarter of dipping profits- ist Q is headed the right direction- 35 by April should be easy- 15% - i'm in at 30.30- sold at 49.50 / and told you all to as well
got to go back 5 years to get to this stock price
only reason for this to miss eps is revenue is not enough to pay eps estimates.
i suspect company employees are thumb dwn on these posts on facts. one can blog the subject to find the articles. Officers and Directors at fault
ACHC is up 4.93% to 37.54
A week after I bought this mgmt joke of a UK move this dropped to $12. Later the CEO said I did nothing wrong. 5 years later still trying to get my $ back
$0.58 net profit for the quarter was actually pretty good. May be a good day to buy.
Great conference call.....future looking bright. Pandemic causing lots of depression and behavioral issues.
45 high 24 low. today 28 sinking after a ton of hype. So what do we have?
i took another look but this was trading over $80 a share when CEO and Directors thought it a good idea to acqire in the UK. Later the CEO was fired but during a Conference had the arrogance to imply he did nothing wrong. did I get this right?
74 to 31
see http://greatchartanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
"the numbers look good, and shorts are starting to take profits, i think i'll hold out for $35 or so"
$63 target $75 hype
really nowhere to go - 14% growth rate = 14 PE / new adjusted 2019 earnings projection of $2.82 ( a reduction from 2.85) means fair value is $39.50 with a PEG of 1 which is fair ( PEG is price over earnings divided by growth rate) a 1 is fair but in this market those have been pushed up to 1.2 1.4 / SELL OVER 40 -
Target fell pretty hard $69 to $59. The future UP delayed. UK debt 5 years paying off the debt
way overreaction. should bounce back to 34 on monday

The momentum is very indicative if the old ceo and directors had not moved into the UK this would be trading over $100 today. The momentum will slow as revenue will be used to pay down the debt. Amazes me how dramatically the old ceo pushed ache off a cliff like that. And the directors let him
Time to rocket!
Simple Wall Street article describes ACHC dire future handling it debt burden. This is the debt burden caused by the acquisition into the UK. That decision destroyed Appreaciation short term and long term. Great Revenue numbers but when the debt load is so great Appreaciation will be nill for many years. The president is gone the directors remain.
