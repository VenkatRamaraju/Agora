"Stock price was $68 about a month ago......nothing has changed with the business. FUD created when CEO retired. She is still with the company, serving on the board."
$75.00 next stop
Great conference call.....future looking bright. Pandemic causing lots of depression and behavioral issues.
This is an over reaction ....... CEO is still on the board. She just retired from CEO position. She will still have a major influence on the company.
They are bringing a few new quality people onto their team. Futures of behavioral health is bright.
"Approx 4,000,000 shares sole at $66.??. My guess $75 is not achievable"
$75 target
The point is out of nowhere the company went into huge debt when they acquired into UK. A high flier fell to $12 5 years later back to 60s. They could do it again. Tighten your stops. It was announced on a Friday night. Before one could sell
After 5 years I am in the green. Tighten my stop this time. You never know when a CEO and Directors are going to acquire where the workforce doesn’t exist. The new CEO very high marks but in my opinion the Directors should be gone to.
$73 target let’s go. The $ rolling in paying debt and adding value thanks to the new CEO

The debt due to UK acquisition still haunting this company
Be careful here A day after I bought mgmt acquired a move into UK. That imploded. Still paying off the debt.
Target fell pretty hard $69 to $59. The future UP delayed. UK debt 5 years paying off the debt
"PHILADELPHIA, March 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaskela Law LLC announces that it is investigating Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACHC) (“Acadia” or the “Company”) on behalf of the long-term Acadia stockholders.Recently an amended shareholder class action complaint was filed against Acadia on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018. According to the amended complaint, during that time period the “defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud and made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors regarding Acadia’s business and operations,” including by falsely stating that: (i) offering quality care was of fundamental importance to Acadia’s business model, and that its facilities provided high-quality care that would drive Acadia’s success; (ii) Acadia adequately staffed its facilities to ensure its ability to provide appropriate care to patients; (iii) Acadia’s facilities were in compliance with relevant regulatory requirements; and (iv) Acadia’s U.K. operations would achieve substantial revenue and earnings growth in the face of nursing shortages and negative media reports about the Company’s operations.The investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Acadia’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct."
$75 target is 12 months from today and a $50 along the way. The previous ceo came close to killing this company the directors should have been fired too.
Great news I have been stating for sometime now the Directors voted to acquire and make the UK move. That act drove the stock to $12 nearly destroying the company. The Directors are weak and should all go years ago. Five years of recognizing the failure and paying back the debt. Be careful the management can destroy it again.
Acadia Healthcare Company is up 4.95% to 61.27
Of course UHC is a better company but if it were not for ACHC huge mistake in the UK Acquisition taking on $3B in debt ACHC would be trading $150.
Might beat eps
