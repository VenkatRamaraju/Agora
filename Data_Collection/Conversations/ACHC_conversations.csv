UK globalism
Zacks had this a strong buy just before it’s UK move. So it could surprise investors again. The same mgmt and directors continue. Today trading over target along with huge debt. Not avg down for me. Mgmt a gambler attitude
hard to believe this was trading at over 70 2 1/2 years ago.
was this sector in the green for 2017? this must have been the worst performer in the sector.
ACHC is up 4.96% to 41.44
ACHC reached a new 52 Week Low at $28.39
17 x 2.85 (2019 earnings) = 48.50 will head that way toward August- Sept (when companies begin to trade on future's years earnings- 17X 2.48 (2018 earnings) is around 42.50 16x is about 40 so its around fair value now-
Would have been trading at $80 by now. Terrible mgmt and directors
dooms day investment
$34 in a year 5 more back to $70. So how many years to right the UK wrong. A decade
Not so much time left to buy before it never returns to the current level ~$31
Rehab Play AACH. NEWS OUT...Maybe making a comeback with restricting completestill under .04 !!!!
i got to tell the board sitting in a hot tube in Mesa AZ i met a heathcare worker from midwest on vacation working in UK. UK lacks healthcare skills. so for the lack thereof this stock sinks. i wanted to ask her salary whatever it brought her out of retirement.
Can’t tell if Insiders are dumping it today
45 high 24 low. today 28 sinking after a ton of hype. So what do we have?
another Zacks STRONG BUY that went immediately South. Losing half of its value in 2 1/2 years.

74 to 33 the UK debacle
Need $56 to demo this risky mgmt debt ridden company
mental illness is soaring. achc is expanding. stock has taken a little hit for no reason.the wind as at their back and the sell side is all quiet. love the setup.
Down it goes like I’ve said the CEO and Directors should be locked up for the UK move. As a business mgmt first question can we make $ in the UK NEXT is the workforce available in the UK? A resounding NO.
$54 target
Is COIN going to outperform ACHC
74 to 26 CEO is out who led the company to Globalism into the UK. I just have a feeling a political move....somebody phoned him somebody cause at this level HE knew the UK did not have the workforce to support the move. I happened to meet a mental health pro at a 55+ retirement community. The salary was so huge she came out of retirement.
ACHC reached a 52 Week low at $24.58
see http://greatchartanalysis.zohosites.com/ .
"Another JV approved 144 beds- It's all about the number of beds ( each bed is a mico business) the first year they break even- the second year they are at 1/2 margin, the third year they are at full margin- jv's same deal- so as long as the beds are getting added (the cheapest way to grow) future earnings will beat previous- relax and double down"
"The law firm Bronstein, Gerwirtz & Grossman, LLC is bringing the lawsuit also identifies the President or CEO or both selling over 700,000 shares soon after the company hyped the companies future then reported the losses in the UK market. Don't be fooled by the two dissing messagers. These people will eventually get Federal Prison time. I for one will applaud their sentencing"
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 49.29
lock down a big JV and announce it!! c'mon guys get it together....help the shareholders.....you all got out at 51.5....that was sneeky...in a secondary only offered from insiders.....your actually lucky there isn't a law suit over that....cause correct me if i'm wrong but you had an idea about the 3rd q miss when you sold? that's illegal....but you snuck one by them congrat's
Going to join the law suit ceo and directors killed it with the UK acquisition. The required workforce in the UK didn’t exist. I met a RN who went back to work for the huge work package. She was 75 years old.
74 to 24. whats the payout for the ousted CEO?
Hey Greg......how are you feeling now? You've been bashing this stock non stop to support your short position. Are you waiting for $60 a share to cover ROFLMFAO
The debt due to UK acquisition still haunting this company
"Period Ending 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Net Income 45,618 49,630 34,958 41,818"
Argus target $70 lasted about 3 days
ceo must be sweating it.
The NEW CEO deserves a lot of credit. The previous ceo destroyed the upside 5 years ago but the directors let him.
target 38
a year ago September had this STRONG BUY now falling to STRONG SELL. They have 0 shame
70 to 26 on a Zacks strong buy
somebody let the goose out of the bag. 85 to 11 to 22 in five years and falling hard. all over mgmt decision to go UK. It's scary really
ACHC is up 4.92% to $43.54
why buy this debt
$70 to $31 to $35. while mgmt sold after hyping it at the top before revealing the debacle moving into the UK. These people will be going to prison.
go girl go

analysts corruption 10 continue to rate the company buy to strong buy when Zacks concede a strong sell. SECshould round these people up and jail them
6 winners in 9 days. Can’t beat those stats and THESTOCKDORK (search them) is the reason I am on top
ACHC is down -9.16% to 39.15
national debt of UK 88% of GDP
i took another look but this was trading over $80 a share when CEO and Directors thought it a good idea to acqire in the UK. Later the CEO was fired but during a Conference had the arrogance to imply he did nothing wrong. did I get this right?
target dropped to 40
The UK ACQUISITION GOT THE CEO FIRED. A lawsuit is pending. Based on what investors are seeing today this should be trading $100 right now. I for one investor impressed with the new CEO
mgmt destroyed the company
lol nobody believed the hype
Looks like 1 fund decided to dump their shares. 7% down was ridiculous given neutral earnings. If you look at earnings from a currency neutral perspective they look much better.
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 53.51
"is $50,000,000 going to be enough to payoff justice."
ACHC is down 7.55% to $29.63
sure glad Zacks came clean a strong sell long after the sell off
Acadia Healthcare reached a 52 Week high at 36.16
Blackstone came out said BEXIT hurting growth. so achc directors and ceo certainly did not know what the UK acquisition was going to do with equity 70 to 30s. amazing failure
hedge fund hype then a 12% drop. lol
"Anyone buying here, seems like this is in for a nice rebound"
ACHC is down -4.93% to 35.84
Humpty Dumpty lives in Franklin Tennessee
like I said limit buy at 20
Argus $68 to $70 to $68 now what?
start thinking of averaging dwn. everybody in the Red. I add at 20. bonuses all around.
Short sellers destroy company’s stock
Insiders selling more then buying in the $60 range so the future for me is worrisome
bonuses all around globalism policy crashed this company
$3.27B debt remains must give credit to the new CEO. The rest the same ole regime who supported the previous CEO ON THE UK ACQUISITION. Can we fire them? Guess not. Just yes men/Women in the background. This stock should be trading $100 less that gooooof.

how soon can we expect sentencing
80 to 25 last 5 years the debt so hight the PE is NA
lawsuite needs to be expanded.
10 analysts buy to strong buy but in sector ache rates a 22 sector 47. So why would 10 analysts rate this so high?
Next hurdle the lawsuit. ACHC will lose it the litigation and fines TBD. Only investors will be hurt. Minus the UK DEBACLE WOULD BE TRADING OVER $100 a share
Acadia Healthcare is up 6.95% to 30.18
hype then crash stock mostly crash
as a shareholder I vote to retain the last CEO wonder who went all in on a UK acquisition. Let's bring that expert back. Then the Directors who are still there who must have voted YES. As a PM at Boeing on new business the question CAN WE MAKE MONEY in the UK? Nobody asked does the WORKFORCE exist to support that move? New ceo new cfo trying to fix a mgmt screw up. These Directors are still there. Amazing failure of any business model.
15 years then. Mgmt total destruction. past 3 months nada
at least they got a banker on the Board of Directors
What happens? ACHC melts down like ice.
Zacks had this a strong buy at 68 fell like a rock after the UK Debacle today a buy after losing most of its value. Zack evaluation is void of due diligence knowing 0 about the companies UK expansion. Another could be just around the corner
ACHC is down 4.93% to $32.98
Mental illness and drug addiction are skyrocketing with the pandemic. States and federal government will be providing benefits for all in need. Looking good for future of Acadia.
2 1/2 year slide from 75 might be over now the recovery .15 at a time.
"By the way I bought small positions in 5 Zacks STRONG BUYS. All today in the red, needing $68 to be in the money. I then Googled stock picker success rates and found Zacks and Cramer are dead last among pro’s at 50%."
Should be trading over $100.
Simple Wall Street article describes ACHC dire future handling it debt burden. This is the debt burden caused by the acquisition into the UK. That decision destroyed Appreaciation short term and long term. Great Revenue numbers but when the debt load is so great Appreaciation will be nill for many years. The president is gone the directors remain.
ACHC is down 13.63% to 15.27
Moody CREDIT NEGATIVE
back to 26 mismgmt galore
The momentum is very indicative if the old ceo and directors had not moved into the UK this would be trading over $100 today. The momentum will slow as revenue will be used to pay down the debt. Amazes me how dramatically the old ceo pushed ache off a cliff like that. And the directors let him
be careful with this company at $85 this company was destroyed by Insiders. They fired the CEO as a scapegoat but all the others who agreed to the UK acquisition are STILL THERE.
$30 to go to get my money back. That trip into the UK a disaster
$1.66B debt down from $3B. The ceo has worked a miracle

"PHILADELPHIA, March 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaskela Law LLC announces that it is investigating Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACHC) (“Acadia” or the “Company”) on behalf of the long-term Acadia stockholders.Recently an amended shareholder class action complaint was filed against Acadia on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s common stock between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018. According to the amended complaint, during that time period the “defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud and made numerous materially false and misleading statements and omissions to investors regarding Acadia’s business and operations,” including by falsely stating that: (i) offering quality care was of fundamental importance to Acadia’s business model, and that its facilities provided high-quality care that would drive Acadia’s success; (ii) Acadia adequately staffed its facilities to ensure its ability to provide appropriate care to patients; (iii) Acadia’s facilities were in compliance with relevant regulatory requirements; and (iv) Acadia’s U.K. operations would achieve substantial revenue and earnings growth in the face of nursing shortages and negative media reports about the Company’s operations.The investigation seeks to determine whether the members of Acadia’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders in connection with the above alleged misconduct."

Investors trying to buy at the bottom. Get fooled every time. Debt ridden for years to come
ACHC way OVERBOUGHT - could pullback to 44$ - 45$ next week
my take is either the annoucement yesterday that one or most of the lawsuits has commenced for the actions up to oct 2017. OR the fact that it was not disclosed timely of a potential buyout by the private equity group.
Met a retired nurse 4 yrs ago who went back to work in the UK for this company. The $ was so good. She is still working now 71 yo. So she has her own place over there and car. We are both thinking how could Acadia ever make the UK aqusition ever profitable. There was something in it for the ceo and cfo both gone now. So my question what could it have been?
supposedly this is the last quarter of dipping profits- ist Q is headed the right direction- 35 by April should be easy- 15% - i'm in at 30.30- sold at 49.50 / and told you all to as well
2.0 consensus a Hold rating however many insiders have sold. Just enough to pay the payroll and debt. CEO DID A NICE job but
ACHC is down 10.78% to $33.78
$0.58 net profit for the quarter was actually pretty good. May be a good day to buy.

"Girg, if you hate this company so much, just stop talking and leave. You can have a better life then. In the long run, Acadia will prosper due to its knowhow and competotive edge and the trend of the society. Also the price now is so cheap, it is totally overreaction of the market. Tatget $40+ in 12 months time horizon."
51 target a bit overzealous but now that you bought
I think this has to do with short seller Marc Cohodes referencing ACHC and retweeting his pal AureliusValue regarding ACHC. Volume and chart lines up with his tweets. Aurelius is short ACHC. Cohodes is not clear but wields the bigger stick. I bought on the weakness. I'm sure Jacobs will be asked during the Credit Suisse meeting tomorrow
After 5 years I am in the green. Tighten my stop this time. You never know when a CEO and Directors are going to acquire where the workforce doesn’t exist. The new CEO very high marks but in my opinion the Directors should be gone to.
only reason for this to miss eps is revenue is not enough to pay eps estimates.
"$85 to $11 to $25 in 5 years. the replaced CEO was crazy going into the UK but he said, I did nothing wrong."
