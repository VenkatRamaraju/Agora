I just noticed yesterday that NWL 5yr cds has tripled over the last year. Makes me think that someone knows something that’s not readily apparent.
So when are these buybacks happening?
"Couldn’t help but to take profits today. Wanted to stay longer, but seeing that much green was too much. Good luck and thank you uncle Carl!"
I like the brands this company owns. The market cap seems like a good buy to get all those brands. Not too much debt and a decent dividend. Company doesn’t seem to make money tho. Not sure if this is a value trap.
"I think anyone that loads up on this stock will be rewarded in the long term. I invest in value stocks for a living. I purchased Apple, Qualcomm, Micron, SNAP and many others when they were out of favor. I picked up Newell at $21 and $16 and will continue to add to my shares at these cheap prices."
2 weeks to go! $30+. Good luck all longs. Dividend is just a bonus.
What could be today's problem with this stock in a market that is positive?
"Has anyone gone to NWL new website?If Q4 was going to be poor, CEO and CFO would delayed such a positive and professional website.Ichan will bein talking about NWL on CNBC when asked last time when discussing Dell, He responded I am working with some which currently prohibit me discussing. New website tells me quarter will be good, sales of product lines making progress, and with Wells Fargo Analyst with a $34 target 2019 will be very good for the stock.The underlying story: More profits with less debt/interest expense as the numerator, and a smaller denominator with significantly less shares outstanding. $30 in 2019 is very achievable if and when management can give longer term guidance supporting a more focused business model that can achieve higher profits. Billions of dollars has been spent and will continue to reducing debt and reducing share count as more product lines are sold in 2019.How will Ichan sell his huge position?Sell Newco NWL in 2020 for $40 per share or more"
"does anyone have experience with massive buybacks? like what does the cost per share look like? since they are buying back something like 200m shares. volume is just 10m shares, and that buying and selling."
What a beautiful stock! Great yield and great price
Celebrating my $600 hit today by spending $14 on Newell brands school supplies.
"It's a very nice stock. I happen to like this companies products a lot. Which is a good thing, because my wife buys so many of them!"
INSIDERS BUY VALUE...THEY DO NOT CONTROL THE MARKET. BUYERS WILL BE REWARDED
Buyer under $24.75
Beat!!!
What a beautiful stock
"ouch.........Newell Brands stock price target cut to $19 from $25 at J.P. Morgan7:28 am ET October 16, 2018"
Company is worth more than my previously stated $26.67/ share. Revision coming soon!
"The market did not like the strategic initiative plan that will decrease its customer base by 50%, Still, it is expecting growth in revenue and earning of $2,72 to $2.76 per share. Markets tend to overreact to changes in company structure."
As long as Icahn doesn't sell out I will continue to hold my shares. He paid a lot more than I did at $15.90
time to buy Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) ?
So NWL is up on a red day on their ex-dividend date... Are we living in opposite land?
should get close to 23 today
"It is nice to see Ichan and now Blackrock both > than 10% holders. Icahn filing used less shares outstanding which shows he is working closely with NWL while Blackrock used the shares per last filing by NWL but Ichan's shares outstanding number is valid but Blackrock had to use the shares per the company's last public filing.Nice NWL also announced the Dividend of $.23 which will be paid to stockholders of record as of 2/28 on 3/15. Annualized using today's closing price of $21.33 is a yield of 4.3%.This stock is going much higher in 2019 and 2020. This is a great long term investment.Raising cash by becoming a more focused business entity selling certain product lines, and using that cash to reduce debt and buy back shares giving all investors a greater ownership.The fireworks, because of a much higher share price, will begin much before the 4th of July."
"It's funny how all people want on this board is to hear how ""great"" Newell is, that it's a ""hidden gem"" uncovered by investment geniuses. Any comments to the contrary are immediately frowned up with the ""thumbs down"".Yet reality is the stock is in the sheeter and why?-There's no management in the company. -They've sold the good assets and are left with the sheet-Our activist in completely inactive-Shareholders don't receive any communications.....accept on the proxy communication which states ""thanks for your continued faith in Newell""But all these comments above are frowned upon........need to talk up the ""gem"" potential.I was in Costco and saw child car seats on the end of isle display. There was a Graco for $200 which was about $70 less than can be had a best retail locations and Amazon. Next to the Graco was a generic for $100! This is the reality of what is happening to Newell products. They are being disrupted. Mall traffic is expected to decline 25% in the next five years.....that's just a fact. Can you imagine what a negative 5% comp store sale result for five years will do to the Yankee Candle business........catastrophic! Sorry, guys, but Newells best days are behind it.Nobody like reality on this board but this company is in serious sheet. And where is the illustrious board in all this."
"My favorite paragraph from the conference call transcript...""As for the remaining noncore businesses, we're well on -- along on the sales process for several with others beginning to take shape. We're on track to deliver about $10 billion in after tax proceeds through these divestitures, and we'll use the proceeds coupled with our operating cash flow after investment, in the business to continue to delever and also buy back shares at very attractive prices."""
Newell Brands is up 5.05% to 22.87
"WOW insiders are buying shares today 8/8/2018 one 50,000 shares at $20.50 and one 25,000 shares at $20.93. Told you it was time to buy some today. Time to buy for sure"
Analyst are predicting a strong holiday buying season this year. NWL has the brands!https://www.newellbrands.com/our-brands
"I have long been favorable to this stock. But the price action baffles me. Is this Opportunity or Bad News bomb waiting to be dropped on public? If this is opportunity then the big funds usually see it before us. Usually, but not always. On the other hand - Bad News can only be an accounting scandal or fraud. Else the usual drivel - that is - competition from online, heavy debt, aging product line, etc etc - has already taken down this premium stock from $50 to $25. What's driving it to $15? While I research this stock - I have added at $17 and looking to add more at $16 or $15. This is too low - someone selling a lot to have cash for something bigger. Meaning I have a gut feel - this is opportunity."
"I'm sold bad at investing. everything I buy goes down, and every time I sell it goes right back up (my total stocks is down 38% this year) can someone please point me in the right direction on how to invest . thanks"
Just added at 18.56. Still profitable... good divi. Great brands. Love a good panic sale.
"No reason to sell, everyday use items will sell in any market conditions! Not sure why it's trading lower by 7% with such solid earnings, company is here to stay."
"15x 1.73 = $26, 18x = $31"
Supply chain problems overplayed. Buy.
Can anyone guess what was had the highest product growth with margins increased in the past 3 years. It has accounted for a major portion of there ability to turn around this segment of the company. Some luck for sure. But if this product is able to stick around I will take it anyday. I will take luck over losses anytime? Guess guys. One of you will get it right. Clue is mentioned in the above reaction! Best to all shareholders. 2021 is setting up to be a huge year. I imagine it will grind in hear until there release full year report. Lots not loose any momentum in 1st qtr either. They are a little employee heavy I hope the do not have to lay any more people off in 2021. 
"Owned this for awhile. Classic turnaround play.Newell was a great name and really accelerated with the Rubbermaid acquisition. But then lost their focus and overpaid for more acquisitions. Looks like they are finally coming back. Great stable of name brands and finally showing innovation around them.My local WalMart, while not the biggest was out of many products that Newell makes. It is finally back in stock. Wonder if this observation will result in strong earnings for the holiday quarter. Hoping that demand for their products will be strong. Just bought a new Mr. Coffee. Nice unit and makes a great cup of coffee at a great price.Holding my stock for now and wait to see what 4th quarter earnings look like. I think that NWL can make $2 per share next year. More than analysts are predicting right now but looks doable.Curbie2"
Here are some metrics and events that will move the stock higher:Catalysts: Dividend not cutCompleting the sale of businesses held for sale generating greater than $7 per shareNew CEO with a great reputation.Valuation metric:Few businesses sell for less than ONE times sales. Currently at $16.50 NWL is trading at .85 times the low end of the 2019 annual range of $8.2-8.4 billion. At 1.0 times 8.2 is a stock price of $19.52; 1.0 times 8.3 bil $19.75; 1.0 times $8.4 is $20.But 1.2 times $8.2 bil in sales is $23.43; 1.2 times 8.3 is $23.70; and 1.2 times $8.4 billion is $24.This stock is just beginning to make its move. I bought more yesterday in anticipation the dividend question will happen at the Annual Meeting Tuesday so NWL may announce on Monday it will pay a qtrly dividend of $.23.Use thes simple metrics to keep yourself from selling unless Q2 is a bust which I don't believe or none of the catalysts I summarize none occur in Q2. But as each of those I list occur the stock will continue to rise.P.S.: The new CFO is amazingly focused and understands NWL's business like few could.With a new well known CEO coming aboard we will see stock closer to $20 than $18.
"NWL WAS UPGRADED THIS MORNING: """"Wells Fargo Lifts Newell Brands to Equal-Weight From Underweight, Price Target to $26 From $23 """" from the great earnings from Friday's, beat both EPS andREVENUE, and also beat last year's EPS and REVENUE.MT NEWSWIRES 8:32 AM ET 8/2/2021"
Great dividend power
I'm sticking around until at least $45...
"With the holiday season around the corner, Newell sales will be off the charts . Good steady climb to $25 by year end"
"The recent divesture of the playing card business marks the end of of NWLs transformation plan. They are lean and mean and laser focused on the core businesses. They have a excellent leadership and two active investors in Starboard, and Icahn, both whom are invested at around $25 per share. 2020 will be a banner year for NWL and I see huge upside into the $30s. GLTA"
"NWL: Great earnings released this morning. Beat both EPS and REVENUE and also beat last year's same period earnings. Icahn is currently sitting on the board of NWL and holds 1,167,979 shares.NWL sold off today due to the whole financial markets sell-off. This is the great bargain stock price rightnow and I am a buyer today,... Great dividend of 3.40% as compared to the CD rate almost 0%....NWL will rebound next week...."
I just pulled the trigger and picked up some shares today. So I'm going to apologize ahead of time because whatever I buy tends to go down before it ever goes up.
NWL is now a 5.36% dividend payer and goes ex dividend on Feb 27 2019. Buy today for a trade or buy and hold for the dividend. Male a plan and stick to it Today is the day to buy.
"They are starting to buy , Here come the buyers"
With Masco and Helen of Troy reporting such strong earnings I'm surprised NWL has continued it downward trend
No reason for this to be trading 2/3 book value
"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Newell Brands (NWL). This company, which is in the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, shows potential for another earnings beat."
"Stock might go up, time to buy. Company Repaid $2.6 Billion of Debt; Repurchased $1.0 Billion of Shares.Company said ""We returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases andpaid down $2.6 billion in debt during the quarter, exiting the year at our targeted leverage ratio. We’veplanned 2019 to be another year of significant portfolio and organization transformation."""
This company is buying back 30% of its shares on top of an operational efficiency effort. A strong buy here at any level sub $30!
"A few points that stood out for me from the CC:1. Dividend is not changing (in response to a specific question from an analyst)2. Asset sales may not materialize if offered prices are fire-sale or below the reserve prices set by management - this can possibly create a binary event for debt reduction in the future3. Management is focused on improving operating margins even if that means loss of sales/market share, including what they call *core-sales*.4. The share count as we exit the year is less to the tune of approx. 12-13%. Further reduction may happen in 2019 but probably not to the same degree.5. The anticipated operating cash flow, normalized for divestiture expenditure and inflation - 200 mil, and restructuring costs - 200 mil, would be between $700-$900 mil (actual would be $300-$500 mil). That is lower than year 2018 ($1.1 B). Adjusted for discontinued businesses, I'm not sure if the ROI as measured on an operating cash flow basis for the continuing operations improves or not (it probably does since they have highlighted improved operating margins again and again)Feel free to add more."
Price today must be with change due to X Dividend Day. I think price is adjusted based on dividend payout.
3 days til judgement day. positive is there are strong players involved that aren't selling. negative the company still has alot of debt. hoping for the positive outcome
"CFO seems to be realistic and straightforward. After watching the turnaround of this company, I have invested roughly 55k into the business @ $21/shMy analysis + model is posted below.https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/50112151-joshjohnston624/5322938-newell-brands-turnaround-and-75-percent-upside-potential"
"Man, I should have bought more in the low 15’s. It’s nice to see green today!"
I’m in at an average price of 19. I think the issue we will have Tuesday is a likely downgrade or two. This is typical after a stock goes down 20% in one day. Analysts are always late to the party. I still believe in the stock but it will likely be a tough road for the next few weeks. Ichan needs to do something to stir the pot.
"Goldman Sachs had recommended stocks with strong balance sheets (low debt). They now prefer companies that are reducing debt aggressively, including these 12: Tapestry Inc. (TPR), Newell Brands Inc. (NWL), -34%, second highest!"
Not many folks on this chat site the only thing I can figure is they are all at the big Box Stores buying Newell Brand products! Can not wait for the next earnings report I am positive this stock accelerate very nice! HAPPY CAMPER!!!
"I'm confused, when icahn released schedule 13d, that states he owns 9.9% of NWL, it says that there is 422 million shares. but in the 10k it says there is 451 Million shares???"
Total return is 3.5% although I have shares showing 31% return. totally happy to collect the dividend waiting for $25
"It looks like they are getting about 2-2.5x sales on the asset sales to date. This alone should be making a statement since the current business is sitting at 0.72. If you assume they will complete the plan, this in undervalued by any metric.-If you assume the market reprices to 1X sales upon completion this is a $28 stock ($9B/321M shares)-If you assume they split the sales proceeds 50/50 between debt repayment and share repurchase you end with**321M shares (assuming a $22 share purchase price) and $4.7B in net debt-If the market doesn't give them ANY benefit from the reduced debt load and new operational focus then you end with a $23.33 share price ($810 in EBITDA (9% of sales) x current 9.24 EBIDTA multiple)-If the restructure gives them operational benefit then this could easily be in the $35-45 range.Seems like a good risk reward to me. Buyer!"
I am still down on my 100 shares but think next week might be time to add more....
"This is a screaming buy- unless they pull the old....we can't get our stuff out of China, routine."
Going to $19 today
Stock cannot go so much lower on bad news 2 weeks before ER. This is dividend cut for sure (in 99%). The problem is it is too late to sell it now. All the bad is already in price.
"Brett Icahn bought another 100,000 at $20 in the past few days"
"Matter of time until they sell off another brand. If they sell off Jostens and get $3 billion for it, then all shares can be bought at $8, half of the shares at $16. I see a company that has earnings, cash flow, a great dividend and great brands. I have the patience to buy more at $15, $10 and even $5. Why is it down? I think there is a lot of negativity with management and they truly dropped the ball with last quarter's release when they didn't make a lot of things clear. The Board should pressure management to put more brands for sale. Put half or three quarters of the businesses for sale. Keep the kitchen and small appliances brands, sell everything else."
They are going to sell off enough stuff this year to retire all their debt. They expect $9 billion in assets sales they said in the call.Will they have massive stock buybacks or will they have a large special dividend in 2020? I don't know. They do need to give shareholders some big incentive to invest at this level.
"Honestly, I never really post on these forums, but I can tell you few things about NWL, there is very little chance of dividend cut due to having close to 5 Bln in working capital not to mention 500-600 million in free cash flow that the current businesses generate. The dividend costs them 400 million and with the business having such a solid balance sheet thanks to the re-structuring, I really believe that long term this business will yield good results for investors. Stop being short term minded and hold until Christmas. Let’s see where the business is on end of year 2019... Thanks Team"
"The Company bought back $500M of stock last quarter. To show just how much that is think of it this way. There will be roughly 20 million shares of NWL traded today, twice the average daily volume. Assuming the Company bought each and every one of those shares, they would still have not spent $500M today. The buy back has only begun and it is going to be huge. Shorts get an umbrella because you need to start covering."
a big misread by me. good qtr and guidance.
This doesn't seem real! I thought stocks I owned only went down?
The debt is being decreased. In fact NWL is paying off some 3% debt. That tells investors the company has a high degree of confidence in the reaing assets held for sale line item will be converted to cash and that funds will also buy back shares. The ICHAN filing showed his ownership percentage increased from share purchases and a shares outstanding down to 422 million shares.IMO share count will be closer to 350 million shares and much less interest expense will drive a very good EPS on NWL going forward. $30 in 2019 is very reasonable assumption. Longer term I believe “NEWCO NWL” will be sold so ICHAN can exit closer to $40 or more.
20 X $1.6 = $32 and 20 X $1.73 = $34.6Shares oiught to trade at 20 times earning or between $32 and $35.........hop on board and giddy up....go Newell go
At today's price there is 0 premium in the share price. Price to sales is currently 1. NWL used to trade at 2.5 - 3X sales. This suggests a $40 - $60 price if Ravi can return NWL to its glory days! GO RAVI!!!
"Where's the genius who foresaw a $3 gain today? I have 3500 shares so I'm not a short, but let's be realistic here.."
$24 soon?
"judging the calls, Chris seemed like a great candidate for CEO. Straight to the point, told us that there needed to be overhead reductions and gave metrics to prove it. Lets get it done."
"I see a wide moat of well known essential brands, and big divestitures helping the balance sheet and increasing profit margins. Look at it as a whole business, this is a great opportunity at these prices. Way oversold in my opinion. Bought more good luck everyone!! Long term play!"
Giddy up
$30 is the correct value of the stock! Get paid which you wait. 4.3% dividend
NWL is in better shape than the last time it traded around here. NWL closed the sale of over $5B in business and repaid debt and bought back stock. They owe half of what they owed when the stock was at $15... I am adding more to my position. It is cash flow positive and profitable. Stock is down 19% on sales decline of 2%...
4.15% yield
"likely to experience the same as BBBY ,(-25%),due to supply chain issues."
I have a 2000 share buy in @ 21.80. How's my chances on this trade look?I like to buy when everyone is selling.
"One way to ""acquire"" competent leadership would be to sell Newell to a company like Church & Dwight which has very competent leadership, and three times the market cap of NWL. Instant qualified top management team with proven track record. Craigie with overlapping directorships already has knowledge of both companies. Come on Carl! Make that phone call."
This is a great earnings reports! Way better than I expected. The $8.1 billion impairment charge is irrelevant since it's due to the drop in the price in the stock and a non-cash item.
"""... but based on these valuation figures, we feel that NWL is the superior value option right now.""Zacks"
Now its a buy shorts gotta cover
silver lining. the dividend reinvestment will give you about 1.7 shares for every 100 you own at this point.
still not time to sell. if you buy this thing now you will still be pleased with your results. just because its risen 50 percent in last month doesn't mean it does not have a long way up still. this thing was just way to cheap and extremely undervalued. stay strong and stay long.
Just announced great results at target and Lowe’s. Consumer spending is strong. Should go well for consumer goods company
"On July 7, 2017 when Boston Beer Company, Sam Adams parent Company, was trading at $133/share Zacks labeled it the bear of the day. Fundamental traders hund in and just over 13 months later it is trading at $318 or an increase of 139%. This call by Zacks on NWL is at the wrong time. Negative sentiment is already baked in and with insiders buying as well as the stock buy back the stock has a lot of upside. Only time will tell but I am long at this price."
Ball jars are sold out everywhere here in The Midwest and they are double the price they should be online. I know it’s only one brand this company owns but I’m thinking with all the stay at home stuff and more doom and gloom on the way this company owns some great brands that will benefit from a stay at home society.
"Now at a $6.5B Market cap with ongoing revenue at a little over $8B. If they sell the remaining divestitures this year, that should bring $4B which will bring net debt down to $2.5B. This equates to a total Enterprise value of $9B. Should be valued at least $16B Enterprise value based upon revenue/remaining brands. What am I missing?"
"Finally, after being invested for years I’m finally in the green thanks to dollar cost averaging during the pandemic. My first purchase at 27$ a share looks embarrassing at this point."
NWL going to 30 in 2021 easy. Maybe even higher. The set up is starting will grind and put in a new base in the 20's then earnings will propel the next leg up in q1 followed by estimates being adjusted higher mid year. The CEO is a turn around specialist. He has gained my confidence already with strategic changes from the top down. Leverage from the inside will be the growth engine with new brands and old brands being the support for NWL. I am seriously excited for the 2021. NWL i be buying some elmers glue today to celebrate. Keep up the good work guys.
"The Company has an authorized $3.6B stock repurchase plan (June 11, 2018). This buy back is being funded by the divestures of units not in line with management’s goals for a stream lined company (e.g. Rawlings). As of the end of Q2, there were 486.2M shares outstanding. At a price of $22/share management can repurchase 163.6M of the outstanding shares or ~34%. Assuming profits remain flat the result of these buy backs will be an increase to EPS of ~50%. Additionally, management is planning to reduce head count and are taking other cost cutting measures to increase profitability on a per share basis. Lastly, at current prices, NWL has a dividend yield over 4% which if reinvested will allow investors to lower their cost basis."
NWL goes ex dividend on Feb 27 2019 paid on Mar 15 2019. Must be recorded owner by Feb 28 2019 to get the dividend and if your short you will have to paid the dividend
"Why would anyone be short NWL at these levels? 2 activist investors running the company who will be hand picking a new CEO, a turnaround plan that is working brilliantly, and a 6% dividend as a cherry on top."
"I just purchased some rubbermaid containers and Parker pens. As a shareholder, I’m doing my part to support a company with great products I believe in. To all the rest of the shareholders, have you also been doing your part and supporting the company?"
"Had no plans of buying NWL today but did. I agree this should have been up on earnings so I took a chance and bought in at $16.47 this morning. Good luck everyone, I hope I found a good opportunity by chance."
Is it time to reach for that falling knife yet?
If you are long NWL this is a nice sale. Might go to $20 before the damage is done.
"Carl Icahn Raises Stake in Newell Rubbermaid Co. (NWL) to 9.89%December 19, 2018 5:09 PM ESTIn an amended 13D filing on Newell Rubbermaid Co. (NASDAQ: NWL), hedge fund Carl Icahn disclosed a 9.89%, or 41,832,250"
"Still a profitable company. Buy now, collect the dividend, and thank me later."
Nice to see a 2% increase on a down day for the market.
"There has been a large amount of insider buying over the past week. I suspect something is going down. Carl’s son is the latest with a 100,000 share purchase. Thoughts on how this might play out?"
LIKE BUFFET SAYS....HE BUYS WHEN EVERYONE ELSE SELLS AND OF COURSE A SPINE OF STEEL HELPS. THE REBOUND HERE IS UNDENIABLE!!!
I must say this held up quite nicely today. feeling very optimistic about the next 18 months
"GRACO car seat & pack 'n' play and NUK zippy cups for my one year old, Kitchenaid cookware in our kitchen, Mr. Coffee coffee pot and Rubbermaid tupperware as well. First alert fire extinguisher and smoke detectors in the house, sharpies in my home office, marmot hiking shoes and a Coleman camping tent for the outdoors.I probably have a lot more Newell Brands products, those are just ones that I can name from the top of my head. I plan to continue purchasing from these brands when I need them, because they are reliable, predictable and affordable.I had no intention of hoarding all these Newell products and didn't even realize I had so many when I first started looking at the stock! I see them everywhere. Newell has such a diverse market penetration that I can only imagine this company holding out for the very long term.With the current stock valuation and insider stock purchases in the near past, I feel pretty compelled as an amateur retail investor to continue dollar cost averaging on this one. Bullish long term."
going to close above $20
"NWL -- Breaking news:-WAS UPGRADED BY UBS RESEARCH FIRM today 6-24-2021: Initiated at BUY at $33 target.Needs to close at $27.25 in order to rise to $28 near term. Icahn Investment holds nearly 1600,000 sharesNWL and currently sit on the board. Nice dividend at 3.5%."
Q1 Sales $1.7 Bil top of range; Q2 sales est $2.1-2.15 BilFull Year Sales $8.2-8.4 bil; Normalized EPS $1.50-1.65$175 mil writedown of Businesses held for sale; But still amounts to future cash per share of $7.50 per share.No mention of dividend but I will check past qtrly releases to see if ever mentioned. But if NWL has decided to cut or eliminate as some has predicted I think it would have been stated herein.As Brad has mentioned for months if Company can attract a top notch CEO like James Craigie NWL would have a jump in its stock price.I think overall a good report and stock over the need weeks will be higher than $15-16.
Nice to be back above $22.
Why is this down this AM? Excellent quarter in a pandemic and management optimism for improved results the rest of the year. This should be up based on these results.
"Good Q1; Good Q2 guidance; Good 2019 Guidance 8.2-8.4 billion.Now what is needed.Get the $700 million from deals just closed.Sell the remaining 4 business carried at $3.456 bil offset by $747 liabilities, net $2.7 billion.for a total of $3.400 billion and reduce debt and buy back as many shares as possible.But most important a new notch CEO WHO WALL STREET RESPECTS.Stock will be north of $20!"
5.67% dividend and the future growth could make this a gold mine. You have to buy on perceived fear. This is selling at a 65-70% discount from around a year ago. Might as well rack up the dividends and wait for management to buy back shares and get rid of debt. In 2-3 years this could be back at $30-$40 dollars and great wealth could be created for those who are patient.
"I am not an expert investor by any stretch but follow my logic. If NWL has 486MM of share outstanding and everything goes to plan in their transfomation plan (big if) and they end up buying back 40% of their shares in the next 12 - 15 months or roughly 200MM shares leaving them with 286MM shares outstanding. If Carl Icahn owns 35MM share and the other shares are owned by Vanguard or Blackrock, or Polk etc, who do not sell right away and the way the market works is that you have to have a seller for every buyer. It’s a simple matter of economics at this point where supply and demand come into play. Not sure how the stock won’t go up significantly as they will create their own significant demand without much supply. Similar to what just happened to RH who just bought back a big chunk of shares. To me, it’s simple economics that will drive the stock up if this does happen."
What a beautiful stock!
"Great time to buy into a huge company with lots of Top Notch Brands, it may take it a little while but it’s worth it if it gets back to $50 share"
"Just loaded up on Newell as a first time investor. I did the same thing in the past with Apple, Herbalife, Micron, Gilead, QCOM and now Newell is my next great value pick."
NWL's CFO is as strong as any CFO I have heard in a long time. Outgoing CEO let him handle most Q&A and he knocked it out of the park. New CEO with him will make things happen.2020 stock will be over $30.
"should touch 17 today, dont believe it will hold but should see close around 16.42. still a long way to go for my 22 cost, but happy to finally see signs of life"
"March 24 Calls for 1.25 seem very inexpensive. Plenty of time for stock to move back toward 52 week high, no? Anyone buying calls right now?"

"Which is a better value investment, and which of these two stocks is most likely to sustain its current DIV: TUP vs NWL?"
8k - Retiring bonds
"Does anyone with a rational opinion have a value in mind what this is actually worth other than pure speculation? I see limited growth, but the book value is good. Intangible assets make up a vast majority of it. Goodwill can be a dangerous game when betting on b/v"
"Rolling the dice on NWL for the second time. First time I bought was last summer at $24, then rode the roller coaster and sold at $24 in Nov or Dec. Back in today at $16 hoping for a rebound as NWL shaves off costs and side businesses."
Undervalued. I believe Icahn and/or his son in at higher price. Great opportunity to get in now. Tremendous call option buying yesterday. Somebody knows something. This is going higher!
"First stock purchase 4 days ago, done great so far, should I sell or what target should i be waiting fo?"
"Divestitures this quarter proceeds next are process solutions $500M and rexair $300M, plus they have $500M on hand. So if the stock hits $10/share they can retire 25% and have roughly $300 to $500 left. Playing cards, rubbermaid commercial & outdoor, Mapa/Spontex/Quickie are still on the selling block. They're goal was to have share count down to 292M and debt to $6B. So they're about there. I just don't like to see the decreasing sales on core businesses. Fisher Price's problems will help with Baby. I think they should sell off outdoor - Coleman/Marmot etc. not really core for them. And dump a ton of corporate over head. Sell off their corporate headquarters - what a waste. Get out of Yankee stores - keep the brand though, great for retailers. All that and they'll have EV of $9B Q3/Q4 on probably $8B revenue 2020, it should work out."
Screaming buy
I added to my position today… If lower tomorrow I will do the same
This is a long-term play. Just hold and forget.
"Sitting on this longer than I'd like, but I believe the position is good."
Hoping to break 17 in September. Slow steady rise is fine with me.
