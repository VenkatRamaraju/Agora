If you are long NWL this is a nice sale. Might go to $20 before the damage is done.

4.15% yield
"I just purchased some rubbermaid containers and Parker pens. As a shareholder, I’m doing my part to support a company with great products I believe in. To all the rest of the shareholders, have you also been doing your part and supporting the company?"
Is it time to reach for that falling knife yet?
"15x 1.73 = $26, 18x = $31"
"likely to experience the same as BBBY ,(-25%),due to supply chain issues."
a big misread by me. good qtr and guidance.
$30 is the correct value of the stock! Get paid which you wait. 4.3% dividend
What a beautiful stock! Great yield and great price
Beat!!!
I am still down on my 100 shares but think next week might be time to add more....
"March 24 Calls for 1.25 seem very inexpensive. Plenty of time for stock to move back toward 52 week high, no? Anyone buying calls right now?"
Screaming buy
Now its a buy shorts gotta cover
With Masco and Helen of Troy reporting such strong earnings I'm surprised NWL has continued it downward trend
"This is a screaming buy- unless they pull the old....we can't get our stuff out of China, routine."
What a beautiful stock
I like the brands this company owns. The market cap seems like a good buy to get all those brands. Not too much debt and a decent dividend. Company doesn’t seem to make money tho. Not sure if this is a value trap.
Supply chain problems overplayed. Buy.
