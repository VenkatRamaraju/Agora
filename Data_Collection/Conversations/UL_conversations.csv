"""The shares have been weak, suggesting the market does not think Unilever can pass them all on and that therefore the margin is at risk,"" said Tineke Frikkee, head of UK Equity research at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management."

"Well, of course Unilever would fail. Ben&Jerry's pinpointed only one country, one nation of people from all nations of the world (including undemocratic ones that butchered deliberately millions)... so when you do that, your stock will suffer of a very bad sentiments, to say the least."

Iced out: Ben & Jerry's loses $111 million in pension funds over Israel boycott
"For all the political rhetoric in this group, it does not seem to have had the slightest effect on the top or bottom lines. This group must be the worst on yahoo for being long on hyperbole and short on facts and fundamentals. Solid quarter, good plan for increases in input and shipping costs."
"Posting this before the shill army makes it out to be some major event. All of this is already known, but it is again in the news:Florida has about $139 million invested in Ben & Jerry's parent Unilever PLC.Starting Tuesday, Florida will stop buying shares of British consumer goods conglomerate Unilever PLC over a decision by a subsidiary, ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s, to stop selling its products in the West Bank and Gaza.------Arizona and New Jersey announced plans to completely withdraw all funds invested in Unilever. Last month, Arizona sold $93 million in Unilever bonds and said it planned sell the remaining $50 million it had invested in the company.------Ben & Jerry’s founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are self-described “Jewish supporters of the state of Israel” but said continued sales in the West Bank and Gaza would be “inconsistent with our values…”----------Oy vey. So Florida will not buy MORE stocks in UL. And some states have sold their UL bonds, so now UL will own some other entity money. How will this $140 billion company ever survive?"

"Unilever margins in spotlight as inflation surgesReuters (today)Oct 20 (Reuters) - Unilever's (ULVR.L) battle with rising costs will take centre stage at its third-quarter results on Thursday, with investors focused on whether the consumer goods giant will cut its profit margin forecast for the second time this year.Crude oil prices hit three-year highs on Monday, vegetable oil prices are at multi-year highs, and packaging, transport and labour costs are also rising as economies recover from the pandemic - a headache for central bankers and companies alike.Tide detergent maker Procter & Gamble (P&G) (PG.N) on Tuesday hiked its full-year forecast for commodity and freight costs by about $400 million, or more than 20%. read moreAnalysts warn Unilever could be particularly exposed because, unlike household goods specialist P&G, it also has a big food business selling products including Knorr soups, Magnum ice-cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise.That means exposure to edible oils, milk and crude derivatives, such as caustic soda (used in making ice-cream), whose prices have also surged over the past three months.Unilever also makes about 60% of its turnover in emerging markets, where inflation is fiercest.""Since the second quarter, inflation has continued to creep up and another (margin) revision is possible,"" Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman wrote in a note.In July, Unilever cut its operating margin forecast to ""about flat"" from ""slightly up."" In contrast, packaged food rival Nestle (NESN.S) kept its full-year operating margin guidance on Wednesday, helped by strong coffee sales and price hikes. read moreAnalysts expect Unilever to report a 0.2 percentage point drop in full-year underlying operating margins, according to a company-supplied consensus. That margin was 18.5% in 2020.Unilever has tried to offset costs by raising average prices by 2.2%, but Ackerman said that was hard in places like South East Asia where pandemic-hit consumers are switching to cheaper brands and local competition is tough.JPMorgan Cazenove analysts estimate Unilever may need to raise prices by as much as 13% over the next two years to offset raw material and packaging pressures, which they say could reach 16% this year, at constant currencies and including hedging.There are other potential catalysts for Unilever's shares, as it works to sell a big part of its 2 billion euro tea business and is also reportedly in the sights of a top activist investor.-------------------Now that's another conclusive meta analysis where nobody even notices any extremist boycotts weighing in. This is just another indication that YOU guys are confused. Yeah you know who you are. The non-analytical MIGA spergs here, posting to get t-shirts from a foreign gov in collusion with the Adelson Foundation.And before the IQ reserve on this board catches on to the caustic soda paragraph, let me just calm you down by asking you to research the caustic soda addition to your drinking water.INB4 shills coping poorly."
"Florida to start divesting from Ben & Jerry’s parent firm over West Bank boycott25 Oct 2021, 8:20 pm￼Pro-Israel demonstrators protest in New York City against Ben & Jerry's, over its settlement boycott on August 12, 2021. (Luke Tress/Flash90) The US state of Florida is set to divest from conglomerate Unilever, over the settlement boycott announced several months ago by its subsidiary, the Ben & Jerry’s ice cream company, local reports say.The move will take effect tomorrow, three months after Governor Ron DeSantis ordered the State Board of Administration to add the London-based Unilever to its list of “scrutinized companies” that boycott Israel. This meant that starting 90 days later, if the position on Israel is not reversed — and it has not — Florida will not invest in or contract with Unilever or its subsidiaries.Last month, Arizona became the first state to pull the trigger on divesting from Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s, in response to its settlement boycott.0:00 / 0:00Read MoreTexas has officially added Ben & Jerry’s and its parent company Unilever to a list of companies that boycott Israel, a further step on the path to the state divesting some $100 million from the companies.New Jersey has announced that it was on the path to follow suit, while New York, Illinois, Maryland, and Rhode Island have launched formal proceedin"
The slow bleed continues. Another good day for the market and another red day for UL. What excuses will we see now? Will we hit the 40’s this week?
