"Unilever is subject to 33 states with anti-BDS laws, 12 of which have pension funds which would require divestment per state contract laws (against investments in companies with BDS ties).

West Bank Palestinians will be losing their jobs as well (10 just for Ben and Jerry's)."

"Sustainability at the source: How Unilever is addressing deforestation, living wages, and regenerative agricultureHow is Unilever ensuring sustainability in sourcing regions? Hanneke Faber, President Foods & Refreshment at Unilever, weighs in.Unilever is one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies. With products available in more than 190 countries, it is estimated that 2.5bn people use at least one Unilever product per day.In food, Unilever has some big names in its portfolio. From Lipton to Magnum, Knorr and Hellman’s, the company’s Foods & Refreshment division boasts an annual turnover of more than $19bn.Unilever has a significant footprint in soy, palm oil and cocoa, amongst other ingredients commonly associated with unethical practices in sourcing regions. The company is committed, however, to addressing sustainability at the source, according to Hanneke Faber, President Foods & Refreshment at Unilever.“Farmers are a critical part of the entire food system,” she said at FoodNavigator’s Climate Smart Food event, adding that Unilever is focused on three key areas in sourcing regions: a deforestation-free supply chain, living wages, and regenerative agriculture.-----------------Spotlight on deforestation: ‘Not all oil is certifiable’Along with F&B giants including Nestlé, PepsiCo, Kellogg’s, Mondelēz, and General Mills, Unilever had committed to eliminating deforestation from its supply chain by 2020.With this deadline now come and gone, FMCGs have new timelines in their sight. “We’ve committed to achieving a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023,” Faber told FoodNavigator.“The challenge here is traceability. We source from a very large variety of suppliers around the world, they harvest in places like Brazil and Indonesia, and we’ve found it’s not always 100% certifiable what happens to every drop of oil we buy.“But we absolutely have to get there and we have to get there fast. This is where technology increasingly helps.”------------------------------“We have a partnership with Google Cloud to capture satellite images, so that we exactly see, 24/7, that nothing gets cut down for the ingredients we buy,” the Foods & Refreshments chief explained.Unilever impacts 8% of global palm oil production. And in soy and palm oil specifically, Unilever is working with Orbital Insight to combine satellite images of Indonesia and Brazil with geolocation data, to paint a clearer picture of ‘the first mile’ – the journey that palm oil fruit or soybeans travel from the plantation to a mill.---------------------------Ensuring farmers and suppliers along the supply chain in sourcing countries earn a living wage is another priority for Unilever.A living wage, or living income, is one that gives people enough to provide for their family’s basic needs for food, water, clothing, housing, education, transportation and healthcare.“We’ve committed to ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to us earns at least a living wage by 2030,” said Faber.Currently, Unilever pays all of its own employees – just over 150,000 people – at least a living wage. However, this latest commitment, announced earlier this year, means the company will secure the same for people beyond its own workforce. “Especially focusing on the most vulnerable,” she continued, “and that’s in manufacturing and in agriculture – so smallholder farmers.”Unilever has a challenge in front of it. It will require collaboration with suppliers, other businesses, government and NGOs to create ‘systemic change’, we were told.Unilever asks its suppliers to comply with its Responsible Sourcing Policy. Unilever asks its suppliers to comply with its Responsible Sourcing Policy, made up of 12 fundamental principles. These aim to ensure a number of key human rights are respected.This includes making sure that all workers are paid fair wages, working hours for all workers are reasonable, workers are of an appropriate age, and land rights of communities, including indigenous peoples, will be protected and promoted.So what happens when these principles are breached? “If a supplier is found to be in breach of those expectations, our aim is always to first work together and agree some sort of remediation plan, rather than automatically stop business,” Faber explained.There would be, however, a ‘number’ of occasions when a relationship with a supplier would be suspendeded, she revealed, but stressed that is not always the first port of call – particularly where living wages are concerned.Full article at Foodnavigator.

Most ice creams have a plastic film over the top to seal in freshness and as a safety seal to prevent product tampering. Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s doesn’t have this seal. They don’t care about freshness and safety. Haagen Dazs Cares!

They are being investigated “on suspicion of assault, causing damage to property and sabotage,” police said in a statement.Video of Tuesday's attack released by Israeli rights group B'Tselem showed several shirtless settlers with scarves wrapped around their faces hurling stones at a cluster of homes and vehicles in the Palestinian village of al-Mufaqara.

"In keeping with the theme of Ben and Jerry's support of terrorists and their introduction of a ridiculous BLM flavor, BLM Nobel Laureates have started to ""cancel"" Carmines (famous NYC Italian restaurant) because showing vaccinations cards is racist. And of course the ""N"" word was supposedly used by a poor Carmine waitress as she was being pummeled by 3 large ladies who were fighting for the rights of their men to infect everyone. What these BLM scholars (one of them has a PhD in Education, which is equivalent to a H.S. GED) fail to realize is that Carmine patrons may be ""packing"" and will blast their way in for a plate of linguine. So much for the BLM boycott. They would have better luck boycotting Ben and Jerry's instead since it is easy to have a Unilever free home. Dove soap gone. Cherry Garcia, I'm truckin' to the garbage can right now."

"I notice several posts claiming that UL has slightly cut it's dividend. No, they have not. They declare their dividends in Euros and the August dividend was 0.4268 Euros, exactly what it was in June and March. The reason it seems to have gone down is because dividends for the ordinary plc shares are converted to British pence and ADR dividends are converted to US$. Both of those currencies have strengthened against the Euro during this year and that reduces the dividend received in those currencies. Unilever has no control over currency exchange rates and it's not their fault if the pence or dollar payouts go up or down when Euros are converted.Here's an excerpt from Unilever's press release entitled ""Unification of Unilever's Legal Structure"" which is available on their website: ""The following will not change as a result of the unification:"" ""Unilever’s dividend policy, with the dividend declaration currency remaining euros and payment in sterling or U.S. dollars continuing for those shareholders who choose it"""

"Two diplomatic cables written by Avraham Harman, Israel's ambassador in Washington, to Abba Eban, Israel's minister of foreign affairs, have been declassified by Israel and obtained from the Israel State Archive. The first cable, sent five days after the attack, informs Eban that a U.S. informant told Harman there was ""clear proof that from a certain stage the pilot discovered the identity of the ship and continued the attack anyway""""On 10 October 2003, The Jerusalem Post ran an interview with Yiftah Spector, one of the pilots who participated in the attack.[111] Spector said the ship was assumed to be Egyptian, stating that: ""there was positively no flag"". The interview also contains the transcripts of the Israeli communications about the Liberty. However, the journalist who transcribed the tapes for that article, Arieh O'Sullivan, later confirmed that ""the Israeli Air Force tapes he listened to contained blank spaces"".[7] The Liberty's survivors contradict Spector. According to subsequently declassified NSA documents: ""Every official interview of numerous Liberty crewmen gave consistent evidence that the Liberty was flying an American flag—and, further, the weather conditions were ideal to ensure its easy observance and identification."""

"Being a long-term investor in FORD (a 4 letter word to investors) I know how many on this board watch as the Market corrects but Palestinian based Unilever's stock price melts like a Ben & Jerry's ice-cream in the summer. Now if Ben & Jerry, along with Bill Ford, got lost at sea ending up stranded on Skull Island I'm sure both stocks would go to Infinity and Beyond."
"The hypocrisy here is amazing. Clearly, B&J will suffer consequences, mild, huge, doesn't matter."
"Here is what Fiduciary Management has to say about Unilever PLC in its Q2 2021 investor letter:""... we added to our position in Unilever PLC, a blue‐chip consumer staple. The company’s large emerging market exposure (over 50% of revenue), which, historically, had been viewed positively by the market due to better long‐term growth prospects, has weighed on the stock more recently. Growth is expected to rebound as these geographies recover, and the stock trades at a meaningful discount to its peers."""
"33 states have anti BDS laws, sorry UL investors. I guess UL learned nothing from what happened to Airbnb"
L Unlike you and emmet I have a life. I don't respond to every post.

"@LittleEmmet is upset since now all he has left are some yo mama jokes. Like this stock, everything else is collapsing. Don't worry @LittleEmmet, I'm sure the Palestinians will take care of you. Man am I glad I sold it all, this stock lost 10% in 3 months, and counting."
Ben and Jerry's was better when they only stuffed my coronary arteries with saturated fat and not their woke views

AS today is the day come out from the shadows ….rationalize to us why you are and how long you been..Man  up…
Unilever dividend reduced—likely due to poor cash flow. This was unlikely due to the boycott issue so when that gets factored in—May see further dividend cuts. I would sell if it’s being held as a dividend stock. So many other better dividend stocks.

"Shockingly poor judgment from UL management regarding B&J, if this is how they run their company, I am very bearish. The board should conduct a leadership review ASAP."
On this day in 1666 The Great Fire of London started.I see no relevance to that and Unilever's share price.

"Ben & Jerry can write NY Times opinions till the cows come home. I have boycotted them for years. It hasn't been easy since I loved Cherry Garcia ice-cream. But I make do with other ice-cream brands knowing that every dollar that I don't spend on Ben & Jerrys is one less dollar that will fund Palestinian terrorists. So now I am researching other UL brands which I can boycott as I repeat this very appropriate saying, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man”. Boycott Ben & Jerry."
"UL lost 15 Billion of marketcap since enabling JIHADIST B&J CEO to go to JIHAD for her.usually in jihad the suicde is the one carrying the bomb , now the suicde is UL side who is bleeding on expense of B&J CEO."

UL down on big up day. Emmett’s a shrewd trader. I’ll go with Sandi’s 49 prediction. Emmett says the 300000000+ US market isn’t important.
"Axios' Alexi McCammond asked, during an interview in the brand’s home state of Vermont: “You guys are big proponents of voting rights. Why do you still sell ice cream in Georgia? Texas — abortion bans. Why are you still selling there?”“I don’t know,” Ben Cohen said with a laugh. “It’s an interesting question. I don’t know what that would accomplish. We’re working on those issues, of voting rights. ... I think you ask a really good question.

"I believe that $UL will be hit hard in the next weeks. Over 30 states have anti-BDS laws and 8 of them already alerted the UL that it has 90 days to change B&J policy or else. Pension funds will get rid of the stock, The franchise owners who paid $400K each have send a letter to the company threating (in nice words) they will not hesitate to sue it's #$%$ off if they will be damaged by reverse-boycott."
