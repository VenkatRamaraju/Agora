CIG is up 5.21% to 2.22
"CIG is finally breaking out. Congratulations to all long time holders whose patience is now paying off. CIG is not only a boring great dividend utility, but currently has a book value per share of around $3.50, still higher than its current price. The market is usually forward thinking about six months. Hopefully, Brazil's economy will improve after years of depression, and CIG will be along for the ride."
Good performance overall since Brazil election. Any idea why this stock zigs when the market zags?
CIG-C is down 8.96% to 3.05
"As a beginner, is it justified to say that this stock is a bust or should i just be patient?"
Brazil's whole market is taking a hit.
"Zema won the governorship in Minas. He is a 54 year old billionaire with interests in transportation, auto parts, leasing, etc. His party is progressive liberal Novo party and he wants to show you don't have to be a reactionary to be financially successful and socially progressive. He yesterday reiterated his desire to privatize CIG, but only after letting true professionals (not Worker's Party appointees) get in there and clean up the mess and make it profitable. Then set it loose from the state. Very encouraging over a 2-3 year time frame."
I think dividends are hitting my Fidelity account today ....
Move up tomorrow
I hope that some of you profited from my post a month ago where I surmised that the stock price would plunge from $2.49 to the offer price of the new shares. I did. The market price is now well below the offer price. This is an indication that the market does not believe that CIG will make its 12/15 debt repayment. As we get closer to 12/15 CIG could go to $1.60.
"1:1 Split on 8/13.I have not found if these were bonus shares (in lieu of dividends) or a dilution of shares which should have caused the price to cut in half. Sometimes, I've seen a Brazilian stock announce something but it does not take effect until a later date. Difficult to know whether this split was good or bad given the lack of information I see"
The STRONG dollar and the passing of the x-div. date has hammered CIG.
"I see CIG is profitable on the balance sheet , why down ?"
A Brazilian court has blocked a CIG competitor from selling electric generating facilities. I wonder if this will have a chilling effect on the Chinese bid for the San Antonio dam ?
"Another small dividend coming in the next week.May also be a dribble if Citibank sells the secondary rights offering, but Citibank is much better at collecting ADR fees than passing on information."
The 3rd Q report is posted on the Cemig website. Looks like a beat in just about every category. Hopefully the market will reward the company and it's stockholders.
CIG-C is up 8.25% to 3.28
"CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. During the past fiscal year, CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS increased its bottom line by earning $0.48 versus $0.25 in the prior year.This is going to get better buy the day I have never been disappointed with this stock."
"CIG can double easily if more buyers cashing in , cuz it's lowly priced stock.I mean undervalued stock."
"R$797 million net income on a float of 971 million shares equals earnings of about $0.20 at current exchange rates. With good YOY comps. Short term volatility, but trend and earnings look very good long term. If Zima can get the state out of the business I could see a quick run to $5"
Where are the Dividends ?
"Cemig advises stockholders that in a meeting on December 18, 2018 the Executive Board decided to declare payment of Interest on Equity in the amount of : R$210,000,000.00 (two hundred ten million Reais), corresponding to R$0.144013969 per share, on account of the amount of the minimum mandatory dividend for 2018. From this amount will be deducted the statutory witholding tax of 15% aplicable to payments of Interest on Equity (except in the case of stockholders that are exempt from this retention under current legislation). For shares traded on the São Paulo stock exchange (B3 S.A.–Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão), this amount will be paid in two installments, the first by June 28, 2019 and the second by December 30, 2019, to stockholders that hold the shares on December 21, 2018. The shares will trade ‘ex–’ these rights on December 26, 2018."
"In a nutshell, This company has too much debt and lower net income! In addition, it is a owned by a the state of Mina Gerais. My first thought is Governments do not have a business strategy, therefore this company will never growth and if so it is because of financial fraud! I recommend stay away from this. comment and share"
Q2 2020 Overview: EPS: 0.35 Expected vs. 0.50 Actual ( Surprise +40.45% ) Revenue: 5.34B Expected vs. 5.93B Actual ( Surprise 11.22% )
Looking for an entry for next leg up. Target: 2.64 at stoxline.
Cig should be $3 a share !
"I live in Brazil. I am a Brazilian citizen. Look, compare the book value per share vs price; return on equity; dividend yield... It is an electric energy distribution company in Brazil. Since the begining of this company I just see three things: growth, profit and dividend yield. It is a wonderful company. I know it is going to beat 2,80 in a couple of weeks."
CIG announced that the company has successfully repactuated its debt and the first payment will happen in 2019. The rise indicates that the market acknowledge the movement.
CIG gets some good news ! Tariff increase approved and central bank moves tepidly to protect the Real. Lets see what our FED has to say today.
how far can it go???
"I've been in the red quite a while and haven't really looked at my cig for a month or so and saw I got 12 free shares, probably from stock dividends. still very bullish on this stock."
earnings before the market opens tomorrow
If CIG was a US company it would be grouped in with the green movement and probably have a $2 0 billion market cap. Luckily it’s not so I guess I’ll buy it at it’s quite low current market cap. Hydro power with some wind/solar exposure for CIG. Seems to be situated perfectly with the weak Brazil real raising the cost of imported fuels
Reuters reported on Friday that CEMIG received 1.139 Billion Real in compensation for the termination of the Saoi Simao and Miranda hydro electric power plants.
"In Brazil now CIG already trading at R$1,15 / 5,501 = US$2.75 ... lolForeigners investers are kind sleeping ...Sudenly you see CIG punching up 10% per day!Just buy and hold. US$6 soon"
Bought a starter at the low. Will consider adding if they keep dumping.
"CIG traded 6.25% of the company's float in the US today. Add what traded in Brazil and Europe and you can see that a significant number of CIG investors left the building today. Sellers believe that the upward momentum is over and the buyers believe there is more to come. CIG may retest $2.79, but in general I think the market will await further developments."
"CIG has announced a loss of 281,834,000 real for the third quarter. This is about $.047/share. This loss would appear to the gov. raiding the piggy bank. Without the gov. demand for greater social security contribution CIG would have reported a profit."
When is the dividend paid out? Ex-dividend date was May 3rd. It's been two weeks already!
Revenue down 10.6% year over year. A loss of .011/share. And now (unable to sell Light) they are going to monetize the investment by issuing new shares. Bad news all the way around. The real at .2558 (almost a two year low). But the stock goes up on heavy trading volume. What am I missing ?
Why down??
"International stocks have been lagging the market, and with the market moving up, this company will get a lot of interest. There’s no reason for her not to it’s a utility, with a low PE."
Energy Co of Minas Gerais is down 5.71% to 1.98
What really happened? is it profit making or is there some ugly news coming? anyone?
"Nice move up today, at the two dollar and 50 Cent strike price"
"We rate CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS (CIG) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its growth in earnings per share, increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, attractive valuation levels and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself."
11.5% SPLITDoes anyone know WHEN these shares will show up on ours accs ??
"This stock has a dismal performance record. 5 to 7 years ago, at least one could count on a regular and decent dividend.I seriously wonder how they can attract new investors with this sub-par performance over years?I think it's time to short this #$%$ and swallow my losses."
what do people know about CIG that I don't?
"Looks like buy the rumors, sell the news here. I think it will retrace."
Can’t find any news on this. Don’t know if to buy more or wait it out.
"Folks this will be back at $3 before you know it, party time "
A dividend of $.05741 to be paid today.
I think institutions AND retail customers are gradually reducing risk.
"I get this info from my eTrade account, CIG dividends. May 3, 2021 was the Ex-date for CIG for 3 different dividends:1. Cash dividend.2. Stock dividend.3. Optional dividend.At this time CIG still has to get Board approval for the different dividends. E*TRADE Corporate Actions will reach out to your investment and see if there is any additional information on the status of the dividends. E*TRADE will contact you once we have the information on the CIG dividends."
Should buy at 1.51 or we will go lower?
CIG-C is down -9.50% to 2.00
Earnings after the bell today
CIG is up 5.48% to 2.40
Transparency has gone out the window with this company. Their quarterly earnings were supposed to be out today. Has anyone seen them ?
What was happened again ?
"Plane crash Jerry's theme song...""I'm only happy when it rains..."" He has no idea what to say when stock goes up."
The value of the Real briefly dipped to $.2399 and the shares of CIG were hammered down to close at a new annual low of $1.65/share. This was a buying opportunity and I added more shares at $1.67.
It seen the lows. All in.
Looks like Goldman Sachs has purchased additional CIG shares
Does anyone think that this is a great buying opportunity?
"Earnings are out, but only in Portuguese. As far as I can tell, which isn't very much, they look good. Anyone able to figure it out? Thanks!"
"Has anyone received the ""Dec 28th"" dividend payment? I have not."
CIG is down 5.00% to 2.26
Will be $2.50 soon
"Cemig advises its stockholders that on December 28, 2018 it will make the following payments decided at the Annual General Meeting of April 30, 2018: :DIVIDENDS:a) R$ 485,569,000, equal to R$0.500288822 per share, in payment of the minimum mandatory dividend to the holders of preferred shareswhose names are on the Company’s Nominal Share Registry on the date of the AGM (April 30, 2018);a) R$ 14,908,000, equal to R$0.030572902 per share, for payment of the minimum mandatory dividend to the holders of common shares whose names are on the Company’s Nominal Share Registry on the date of the AGM (April 30, 2018)"
CIG is up 5.09% to 2.27
"I believe the recent breakdown in CIG relates to the tragic plane crash two days ago outside of Medillin, Columbia which killed a Brazilian soccer team. This is on top of the difficult political situation and recession. I believe the company itself is positioned to weather these tough storms and this company (and stock) will be a winner in the long term."
This will be over $2 soon.
The Brazilian Central Bank has decided to keep their interest rate at 6.5% for the rest of this year.They see inflation at 4% each year thru 2021.They anticipate the R/US at 3.83 in 2018 and 3.75 in 2019.Our Fed meets on 9/28-29. If we raise rates then and again in Dec. there will be greatpressure on the Real. Going forward I see CIG at $1.40
in my opinion I think the smart money is rotating into Emerging Markets
"GGDVF, Guangdong Investment, Ltd., essentially a water utility, but diversified, may be of interest, here.$1.33 this morning, it pays a decent distribution."
I'm new here. Just bought today. Company looks good and looks like there will a huge return in the long.
The payment date for minimum dividend previously announced in May for 2016 profits has been moved to Dec 28th..I think this is good news for shareholders.
"Back in September I mentioned that CIG goes through a seasonal decline that runs to the end of January. February tends to be a strong month, as each of the last 5 Februarys, CIG has gone up through the month. CIG now appears to be finishing a reverse head/shoulder pattern and starting it's upward decent. Full disclosure: I'm long on 22,000 shares. What say you?"
Muito Abrigado CIG!
"Dividend Announcement!Just received this announcement from my broker:Dividend Distribution AnnouncementCIG has announced the following dividend1 distribution: • Payment amount per share $0.1495 USD • Record date May 3, 2018 • Ex-dividend date May 2, 2018 What this meansYou will receive the dividend payment if you hold CIG prior to the ex-dividend date and do not sell CIG until on or after the ex-dividend date.Regular cash dividends will be reflected in your account on the payment date.

"Debt was refinanced per CIG (CEMIG) website. Also heard the Citibank sold US ADR rights and will distribute the proceeds, announcement soon. From CEMIG IR."
CIG-C is down 10.40% to 3.10
CIG-C is down 9.35% to 2.91
"Forward PE 7.16, P/S 0.74, P/B 1.12, ROE 11.76%, enterprise value 60% higher than market value = a value stock that will soon be discovered. With the rotation into international and neglected stocks, investors should be buying this stock not selling right now...."
CIG just broke a downward trendline on the weekly MA chart. We'll see if the upward breakout continues.
"Q1 PROFIT r422,351,000"

"CEMIG offices raided by police this morning. Suspicion of embezzlement of roughly $10M. Presumably prior to the recent elections with the company was loaded with socialist Workers' Party appointees. The new governor, Zema, is still talking up sale of assets and eventual privatization later this year. May use this an example of why the state should not be involved in this company. Being fully in the public market would presumably make their accounting more transparent and accountable."
What is causing this nice little pop today??
worse investment so far
gustosa!!! 120% return! i love volatility
Not seeing a lot of movement in CIG. Does anyone have strong opinions on what may happen when/if the privatization of CIG is approved?
Anyone else see this as a buying opportunity 1.70-180??
"Way Way UNDERVALUED, DIRTY CHEAPCIG at $2.70 is a joke. P/E = 5 in a ELECTRICITY UTILITIES companyWith growing and ethernal demand .... no wayCIG at $5 / $6 in some months.Just buy and hold"
CIG is up 5.56% to 2.47
Does this have a real dividend?
"Ok guys, so here is a link to the split and dividend.https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=CIG"
Let’s get this pumping again!!
Great investment so far !
CIG-C is up 7.93% to 3.13
It beats last quarter earning estimate and rated a BUY.
The new Trump of Brazil should boost markets. CIG back to $5 in 2019?
Up significantly over the last two days on volume. Does someone know something?
Don't they release some news about 2018 dividends at the start of the year? Can't find anything anywhere.
"Dividend did come in finally, much larger than I thought and in 2 payments. Wonder if one is the second sale of rights. Citibank website says nothing (but they did get their ADR fee). What did you get per share? Do remember some of this you had to hold the stock most of 2017."
What's with the big jump today ?
CIG is down 5.11% to 2.51
This stock is a keeper.
"Looks like CIG is still on an assending elevator, as Bolsonaro takes 48.6% of the presidential vote and is the odds on favorite to be the next president of Brazil."
I am unable to access the investor site in CIG's website. Is anyone else having this trouble ?
OMG ! The Real dropped to a two year low and has dragged CIG down with it to a new annual low. I am happy ! I added more shares today.
"CIG is a very depreciated cash cowP/E = 5.5In the Electric Enargy Sector of BrazilA very very stable and predictable business, that gorws slowly but forever and everSo it deserves amuch higher P/E, ate least 11CIG should shift north very rapidly. $5/$6 very soon2.70 is DIRTY CHAEP. AN NO BRAINER BUY"
This should double
CIG-C is down 8.52% to 3.02
Wats the problem now
What's up with this crazy amount of volume and meanwhile the stock is trading flat.
"Current PT (Workers' Party) governor knocked out of first round in elections. An entrepreneur named Zema is the front runner to win, says he will get the government out of the management of CIG, turn it over to the professionals, and when the market reflects it's true value.....privatize!"
Is this the beginning of the new run to $4/share? Awfully strong start between yesterday and today
"Folks CiG will go to $3 by December 2020! Bought an additional 10,000 shares this morning at a discount $2.18 per share, good quality company with a nice dividend"
Can we do it again tomorrow
Any new news?
"Great time to add to overall position, when it is suffering bc of the overall market. I see this slowly rising over the coming year"
CIG-C is down 6.92% to 2.96
"I own shares in CIG and I could not find Q2 financial results with my e*trade account so I went to CIG's website and downloaded the PDF of their Q2 results. Then I had to run them thru Google Translate to get them in English and then match the columns of the translation up with the quarter titles in the original PDF, but I got the results. CIG had a good Q2 but it was hard to get the financial results."
sold at 3.90 went up too far too fast...
Every time it breaks the 50dma it gets a nice run up hope is more of the same here! GLTA
CIG is up 5.45% to 2.13
"Earnings will be posted 1pm Eastern time with simultaneous conference call, per Investor Relations. Also, Q1 and Q2 earnings are being revised.....UP. Seems they weren't dealing with certain depreciations correctly."
What’s happening today with the stock?
A new corona strain found in Brazil. Do you think that causes the drop.
https://discord.gg/9FZe9RKbaY
"movement upward any day now, I'm holding long term"
CIG was $13 a share looking at max chart. Is that correct? I have been in this stock a long time. GLTA
"The Real is at $.2387 ( a multi year low). The Brazilian central bank meets on Tue. & Wed. The right move would be to increase their interest rate. If they do so CIG will rally. With the presidential election on 10/7, politically I think it will be very difficult to do this. I think they will delay raising rates until after the run off election on 10/28. If I am right there will be plenty of opportunity to trade CIG till Nov. If they raise rates tomorrow you will want to be in CIG today."
When does this stock pay their dividend?
"buy 4000 usd at 1,42 :D"
Anyone buying the Dec 2020 2.50 call options?? Seem attractive with cig in low 2s
You guys called the move to $2 Profit taking inevitable.
"CIG failed to sell 7.5% (15M shares) of the 200M offered. Not exactly a ringing endorsement by the market. Shares are currently trading about the offer price, down 3% from last week's high and trending lower. CIG has made zero progress in unloading the assets they identified last on 10/14. Looks like we will be able to add more shares at lower prices soon. All is not bad. The annual dividend payout (not including the ""special"") less the ADR fees and foreign tax came to $.1117/share."
I suppose when Brazil starts dealing with the virus for real there might be some upside in this stock
"Am I correct believing that the most recent $.0657 dividend payment was for preferred shares only, not the common or ADRs?"
"Hard to pass this low, I am going in for more, lol...$"
"announced a final 2019 dividend, payable to shareholders of record 12/23. Roughly $0.07, to be paid in two parts, June and December of 2020"
"Not enough buyers to sop up the shares of all those that did not want to hold over the holiday weekend, so Cig went down again today. If Brazil did not have enough problems a nation wide truckers strike entered its 5th day today. Gas stations are running out of fuel, restaurants are running out of food and the economy is being strangled. But I am not unhappy. I added to my position today."
"Bonus Money!Received this notice from my broker:This is a reminder about the upcoming CIG dividend distribution. • Payment amount per share $0.0142 USD • Payment date December 13, 2017 • Record date December 11, 2017 • Ex-dividend date December 8, 2017 What this meansYou will receive the dividend payment if you hold CIG prior to the ex-dividend date and do not sell CIG until on or after the ex-dividend date."
Volume coming in. Technical strong buy at stoxline. A break of 2.16 could move it up to 2.52.
"Purchased 7,800 CIG shares this morning at $1.74 per share, nice dividend, and there is growth potential with this company, very undervalued, should be a $3 stock at least, going to hold onto this baby in my SEP IRA Account"
Maybe we are seeing $4 by May - would be niceLong and strong CIG
