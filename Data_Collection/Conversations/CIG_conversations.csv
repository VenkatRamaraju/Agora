Should buy at 1.51 or we will go lower?
Retrace back to 2 - 2.25 area.
The new Trump of Brazil should boost markets. CIG back to $5 in 2019?
"CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. During the past fiscal year, CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS increased its bottom line by earning $0.48 versus $0.25 in the prior year.This is going to get better buy the day I have never been disappointed with this stock."
"R$797 million net income on a float of 971 million shares equals earnings of about $0.20 at current exchange rates. With good YOY comps. Short term volatility, but trend and earnings look very good long term. If Zima can get the state out of the business I could see a quick run to $5"
Why down??
"I bought in yesterday as this looks like a great opportunity and fantastic value. I've literally followed CIG for over a decade, and times of turmoil present great opportunities. When the rs took a 9% hit, the stock dropped 36%, the latest sale of the assets to pay debt is going to go a long way to clean up their balance sheet. Though it is a significant piece they are selling, it is by far a minority of their total holdings. Everything is cyclical and the market always over reacts by undershooting or over shooting - here it undershot an already depressed stock and with this corner turned things will likely be a whole lot better in the future."
Becareful with cig!! This Brazilian company is planning to sell from public to private!! As you a cig shareholder you don’t have the right to vote per my broker Just becareful
"Has anyone received the ""Dec 28th"" dividend payment? I have not."
CIG-C is down 6.32% to 2.67
What’s happening today with the stock?
CIG should go to $2 tomorrow
Energy Co of Minas Gerais reached a 52 Week low at 2.58
The 3rd Q report is posted on the Cemig website. Looks like a beat in just about every category. Hopefully the market will reward the company and it's stockholders.
Reuters reported on Friday that CEMIG received 1.139 Billion Real in compensation for the termination of the Saoi Simao and Miranda hydro electric power plants.
Will be $2.50 soon
"Debt was refinanced per CIG (CEMIG) website. Also heard the Citibank sold US ADR rights and will distribute the proceeds, announcement soon. From CEMIG IR."
I think dividends are hitting my Fidelity account today ....
CIG is down -6.42% to 1.75
how far can it go???
"Zema won the governorship in Minas. He is a 54 year old billionaire with interests in transportation, auto parts, leasing, etc. His party is progressive liberal Novo party and he wants to show you don't have to be a reactionary to be financially successful and socially progressive. He yesterday reiterated his desire to privatize CIG, but only after letting true professionals (not Worker's Party appointees) get in there and clean up the mess and make it profitable. Then set it loose from the state. Very encouraging over a 2-3 year time frame."
"Forward PE 7.16, P/S 0.74, P/B 1.12, ROE 11.76%, enterprise value 60% higher than market value = a value stock that will soon be discovered. With the rotation into international and neglected stocks, investors should be buying this stock not selling right now...."
I hope that some of you profited from my post a month ago where I surmised that the stock price would plunge from $2.49 to the offer price of the new shares. I did. The market price is now well below the offer price. This is an indication that the market does not believe that CIG will make its 12/15 debt repayment. As we get closer to 12/15 CIG could go to $1.60.
11.5% SPLITDoes anyone know WHEN these shares will show up on ours accs ??
"I've been in the red quite a while and haven't really looked at my cig for a month or so and saw I got 12 free shares, probably from stock dividends. still very bullish on this stock."
in my opinion I think the smart money is rotating into Emerging Markets
"CIG can double easily if more buyers cashing in , cuz it's lowly priced stock.I mean undervalued stock."
The payment date for minimum dividend previously announced in May for 2016 profits has been moved to Dec 28th..I think this is good news for shareholders.
CIG is up 5.09% to 2.27
New CEO named over the weekend. A former FIAT latin america exec. Not sure this would move the stock this much though. Thoughts?
CIG is up 7.43% to $2.17
"1:1 Split on 8/13.I have not found if these were bonus shares (in lieu of dividends) or a dilution of shares which should have caused the price to cut in half. Sometimes, I've seen a Brazilian stock announce something but it does not take effect until a later date. Difficult to know whether this split was good or bad given the lack of information I see"
"Folks this will be back at $3 before you know it, party time "
"Ok guys, so here is a link to the split and dividend.https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/calendar?symbol=CIG"
Only a matter of time before this goes past $4 per share
"Cemig advises stockholders that in a meeting on December 18, 2018 the Executive Board decided to declare payment of Interest on Equity in the amount of : R$210,000,000.00 (two hundred ten million Reais), corresponding to R$0.144013969 per share, on account of the amount of the minimum mandatory dividend for 2018. From this amount will be deducted the statutory witholding tax of 15% aplicable to payments of Interest on Equity (except in the case of stockholders that are exempt from this retention under current legislation). For shares traded on the São Paulo stock exchange (B3 S.A.–Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão), this amount will be paid in two installments, the first by June 28, 2019 and the second by December 30, 2019, to stockholders that hold the shares on December 21, 2018. The shares will trade ‘ex–’ these rights on December 26, 2018."

Does anyone think that this is a great buying opportunity?
This should double
The STRONG dollar and the passing of the x-div. date has hammered CIG.

Their contracted cost was 140% of the Brazilian CDI rate.*"
"Any news about earnings, dividend and stock split? When?"

CIG is up 5.45% to 2.13
Good performance overall since Brazil election. Any idea why this stock zigs when the market zags?
When does this stock pay their dividend?
What's up with this crazy amount of volume and meanwhile the stock is trading flat.
Anyone buying the Dec 2020 2.50 call options?? Seem attractive with cig in low 2s
Don't they release some news about 2018 dividends at the start of the year? Can't find anything anywhere.
CIG announced that the company has successfully repactuated its debt and the first payment will happen in 2019. The rise indicates that the market acknowledge the movement.
Every time it breaks the 50dma it gets a nice run up hope is more of the same here! GLTA
"New CIG investor here, x-dividend date was May 2nd, when do we actually get the payment? Thanks"
"CIG failed to sell 7.5% (15M shares) of the 200M offered. Not exactly a ringing endorsement by the market. Shares are currently trading about the offer price, down 3% from last week's high and trending lower. CIG has made zero progress in unloading the assets they identified last on 10/14. Looks like we will be able to add more shares at lower prices soon. All is not bad. The annual dividend payout (not including the ""special"") less the ADR fees and foreign tax came to $.1117/share."
CIG is down -5.98% to 1.73
CIG reached a new 52 Week High at $2.82

"I get this info from my eTrade account, CIG dividends. May 3, 2021 was the Ex-date for CIG for 3 different dividends:1. Cash dividend.2. Stock dividend.3. Optional dividend.At this time CIG still has to get Board approval for the different dividends. E*TRADE Corporate Actions will reach out to your investment and see if there is any additional information on the status of the dividends. E*TRADE will contact you once we have the information on the CIG dividends."
Revenue down 10.6% year over year. A loss of .011/share. And now (unable to sell Light) they are going to monetize the investment by issuing new shares. Bad news all the way around. The real at .2558 (almost a two year low). But the stock goes up on heavy trading volume. What am I missing ?
Let’s get this pumping again!!
CIG is down 7.93% to $3.02
Where are the Dividends ?
"Looks like buy the rumors, sell the news here. I think it will retrace."
I try to buy I can’t buy what is symbol when I put symbol not available
"This stock has a dismal performance record. 5 to 7 years ago, at least one could count on a regular and decent dividend.I seriously wonder how they can attract new investors with this sub-par performance over years?I think it's time to short this #$%$ and swallow my losses."

The U.K.'s Guardian reported on 9/6/21 that Bolsonaro may be planning a coup modeled on our January 6thinsurrection. Unknown is how this would affect utilities.
"As a beginner, is it justified to say that this stock is a bust or should i just be patient?"
"Received dividends today. Works out to 2.583% for the July payment. If I add the January 2017 dividend payment, the annual return is 7.197%. Not a bad return in US dollars. Even brighter days ahead!"
"I believe the recent breakdown in CIG relates to the tragic plane crash two days ago outside of Medillin, Columbia which killed a Brazilian soccer team. This is on top of the difficult political situation and recession. I believe the company itself is positioned to weather these tough storms and this company (and stock) will be a winner in the long term."
I'm thinking this will hit $10 by end of year
Finally some movement up on 2x the volume....institutions buying shares?
"Purchased 7,800 CIG shares this morning at $1.74 per share, nice dividend, and there is growth potential with this company, very undervalued, should be a $3 stock at least, going to hold onto this baby in my SEP IRA Account"
"CIG traded 6.25% of the company's float in the US today. Add what traded in Brazil and Europe and you can see that a significant number of CIG investors left the building today. Sellers believe that the upward momentum is over and the buyers believe there is more to come. CIG may retest $2.79, but in general I think the market will await further developments."
"Hard to pass this low, I am going in for more, lol...$"
CIG is up 5.26% to 1.80
"Purchased 54,678 CIG shares today at $1.53, CIG will be back at $4 by the end of the year folks"
"Renova has ended negotiations with Brookfield over their sale. Brookfield shareholders must be pleased as their share price is up on the news. The real has plunged to $.2778 for one real. One dollar now buys 3.6 real. The only currencies in the world that are losing more value against the dollar are Argentina and Turkey. The Brazilian economy continues to decline. 8 trading days ago CIG lost 6% of its value and it has continued to trade at this depressed level ever since then. If the real continues to lose value, will there be another leg down ?"

The Brazilian Central Bank has decided to keep their interest rate at 6.5% for the rest of this year.They see inflation at 4% each year thru 2021.They anticipate the R/US at 3.83 in 2018 and 3.75 in 2019.Our Fed meets on 9/28-29. If we raise rates then and again in Dec. there will be greatpressure on the Real. Going forward I see CIG at $1.40
"I live in Brazil. I am a Brazilian citizen. Look, compare the book value per share vs price; return on equity; dividend yield... It is an electric energy distribution company in Brazil. Since the begining of this company I just see three things: growth, profit and dividend yield. It is a wonderful company. I know it is going to beat 2,80 in a couple of weeks."

"We rate CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS (CIG) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its growth in earnings per share, increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, attractive valuation levels and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself."
Patience. Big pay day soon.
"announced a final 2019 dividend, payable to shareholders of record 12/23. Roughly $0.07, to be paid in two parts, June and December of 2020"
"Earnings will be posted 1pm Eastern time with simultaneous conference call, per Investor Relations. Also, Q1 and Q2 earnings are being revised.....UP. Seems they weren't dealing with certain depreciations correctly."
I heard about CIG the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
In total how much is the dividend. I’m confused with $0.113 per share and 11.50% dividend. Seem like there are two dividends.
"first half hour volume 2 million, I guess someone heard good news and going to hit double double"
"SPLIT 11.5% Friends, can you see these 11.5% aditional shares on your CIG holding?Are they free to trade or locked? ThanksDIVIDENDSWill be paid on 30/june/21 (half) and 30/dec/21 (half) By the way this a bargain! Strong Buy and hold it"
"Real dropped to another multi year low of $.2431. As a result CIG pressed down toward its annual low, But I am happy. I bought mote today at $1.74."
Cig should be $3 a share !
Volume coming in. Technical strong buy at stoxline. A break of 2.16 could move it up to 2.52.
I suppose when Brazil starts dealing with the virus for real there might be some upside in this stock

"Nice move up today, at the two dollar and 50 Cent strike price"

CIG-C is down 6.81% to 3.01
"Am I correct believing that the most recent $.0657 dividend payment was for preferred shares only, not the common or ADRs?"
Not seeing a lot of movement in CIG. Does anyone have strong opinions on what may happen when/if the privatization of CIG is approved?
If CIG was a US company it would be grouped in with the green movement and probably have a $2 0 billion market cap. Luckily it’s not so I guess I’ll buy it at it’s quite low current market cap. Hydro power with some wind/solar exposure for CIG. Seems to be situated perfectly with the weak Brazil real raising the cost of imported fuels
When do their earnings post next?
Anyone else see this as a buying opportunity 1.70-180??
"CEMIG offices raided by police this morning. Suspicion of embezzlement of roughly $10M. Presumably prior to the recent elections with the company was loaded with socialist Workers' Party appointees. The new governor, Zema, is still talking up sale of assets and eventual privatization later this year. May use this an example of why the state should not be involved in this company. Being fully in the public market would presumably make their accounting more transparent and accountable."
I'm new here. Just bought today. Company looks good and looks like there will a huge return in the long.
Bolsonaro is the new Brasil presidente Feliz ano Nuevo!

"We now know why the governor of Minas Gerais wa willing to force out the top management of CIG. He needed the assets that the management wanted to sell to reduce debt to secure a $2,24 billion real loan to roll over debt coming due shortly. They have pledged major portions of their holdings to secure the loan. This is not the end of it. Another $3 billio real in debt is due in 2017. Moody's is taking a dim view of all this. They expect CIG to generate negative free cash flow until some time in 2018. The terms of the loan could hamstring CIG until 2021. Moody,s expects CIG to ""upstream"" the dividends in order to help serve the debt. With all this the stock today is trading at its highest price in the past month....go figure."
CIG-C reached a new 52 Week High at $2.71
The value of the Real briefly dipped to $.2399 and the shares of CIG were hammered down to close at a new annual low of $1.65/share. This was a buying opportunity and I added more shares at $1.67.
Dividend paid.

S&P has downgraded Minas Gerais debt to CCC-. They say that there is a 1 in 2 chance that Minas Gerais will default on its debt over the next 6 months. Their largest creditor is the federal gov. They have about R900M that is due others. THey can look forward to getting about R300M from CIG by the end of Dec. As the majority owner of CIG it would not surprise me if they pressure CIG to come up with an extraordinary div. to help out.
"CIG has announced a loss of 281,834,000 real for the third quarter. This is about $.047/share. This loss would appear to the gov. raiding the piggy bank. Without the gov. demand for greater social security contribution CIG would have reported a profit."
"Not enough buyers to sop up the shares of all those that did not want to hold over the holiday weekend, so Cig went down again today. If Brazil did not have enough problems a nation wide truckers strike entered its 5th day today. Gas stations are running out of fuel, restaurants are running out of food and the economy is being strangled. But I am not unhappy. I added to my position today."
Looks like Goldman Sachs has purchased additional CIG shares

Maybe shares at a higher price are being sold in exchange for cheaper ones? Definitely suspect. It’s definitely odd.
We going to make some good money this...
This stock is a keeper.
A Brazilian court has blocked a CIG competitor from selling electric generating facilities. I wonder if this will have a chilling effect on the Chinese bid for the San Antonio dam ?
why sudden drop????
"The Real is at $.2387 ( a multi year low). The Brazilian central bank meets on Tue. & Wed. The right move would be to increase their interest rate. If they do so CIG will rally. With the presidential election on 10/7, politically I think it will be very difficult to do this. I think they will delay raising rates until after the run off election on 10/28. If I am right there will be plenty of opportunity to trade CIG till Nov. If they raise rates tomorrow you will want to be in CIG today."
"Back in September I mentioned that CIG goes through a seasonal decline that runs to the end of January. February tends to be a strong month, as each of the last 5 Februarys, CIG has gone up through the month. CIG now appears to be finishing a reverse head/shoulder pattern and starting it's upward decent. Full disclosure: I'm long on 22,000 shares. What say you?"
I'm outta here....This board is nothing but spammers !
"Sort of sad when the ""top reaction"" is spam."
the company is in a bad moment. A lot of debit. But it is trying to sell some actives. The management reported this week to have received some offers to buy part of it. Next year is key to know if they will be successful in restructuring the debt.

"The Brazilian people say that their number one concern is ""violence"". 40% of the people would support a return of the military dictatorship and the leading presidential candidate is in jail.

I purchased this stock years ago when it was between $2 and 3. the exchange rate was around 2.6 real to 1 dollar.Today the exchange rate is over 4 to 1. So why is it selling at $1.77? especially with whats happening in brazil. seems like we should now be able to buy this for about a buck.
what do people know about CIG that I don't?
"Earnings are out, but only in Portuguese. As far as I can tell, which isn't very much, they look good. Anyone able to figure it out? Thanks!"
CIG-C reached a new 52 Week High at $3.03
Looking for an entry for next leg up. Target: 2.64 at stoxline.
"CIG is a very depreciated cash cowP/E = 5.5In the Electric Enargy Sector of BrazilA very very stable and predictable business, that gorws slowly but forever and everSo it deserves amuch higher P/E, ate least 11CIG should shift north very rapidly. $5/$6 very soon2.70 is DIRTY CHAEP. AN NO BRAINER BUY"
"CIG is finally breaking out. Congratulations to all long time holders whose patience is now paying off. CIG is not only a boring great dividend utility, but currently has a book value per share of around $3.50, still higher than its current price. The market is usually forward thinking about six months. Hopefully, Brazil's economy will improve after years of depression, and CIG will be along for the ride."
CIG is up 8.61% to $2.87
Good buy today. Headed to $2.50
"Current PT (Workers' Party) governor knocked out of first round in elections. An entrepreneur named Zema is the front runner to win, says he will get the government out of the management of CIG, turn it over to the professionals, and when the market reflects it's true value.....privatize!"
Great investment so far !
Any new news?
CIG is down -100.00% to 0.00
"Any chance of CIG going back to $5, $10, $14 old high in our life times?"
CIG just broke a downward trendline on the weekly MA chart. We'll see if the upward breakout continues.
Transparency has gone out the window with this company. Their quarterly earnings were supposed to be out today. Has anyone seen them ?
CIG reached a 52 Week high at $3.62
sold at 3.90 went up too far too fast...
