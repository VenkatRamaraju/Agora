"I own shares in CIG and I could not find Q2 financial results with my e*trade account so I went to CIG's website and downloaded the PDF of their Q2 results. Then I had to run them thru Google Translate to get them in English and then match the columns of the translation up with the quarter titles in the original PDF, but I got the results.
