"I own shares in CIG and I could not find Q2 financial results with my e*trade account so I went to CIG's website and downloaded the PDF of their Q2 results. Then I had to run them thru Google Translate to get them in English and then match the columns of the translation up with the quarter titles in the original PDF, but I got the results. CIG had a good Q2 but it was hard to get the financial results."
Brazil's whole market is taking a hit.

"Forward PE 7.16, P/S 0.74, P/B 1.12, ROE 11.76%, enterprise value 60% higher than market value = a value stock that will soon be discovered. With the rotation into international and neglected stocks, investors should be buying this stock not selling right now...."
I think institutions AND retail customers are gradually reducing risk.

What was happened again ?
"We rate CIA ENERGETICA DE MINAS (CIG) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its growth in earnings per share, increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, attractive valuation levels and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself."
What really happened? is it profit making or is there some ugly news coming? anyone?
"Back in September I mentioned that CIG goes through a seasonal decline that runs to the end of January. February tends to be a strong month, as each of the last 5 Februarys, CIG has gone up through the month. CIG now appears to be finishing a reverse head/shoulder pattern and starting it's upward decent. Full disclosure: I'm long on 22,000 shares. What say you?"
Any new news?

what do people know about CIG that I don't?
"I've been in the red quite a while and haven't really looked at my cig for a month or so and saw I got 12 free shares, probably from stock dividends. still very bullish on this stock."
"CEMIG offices raided by police this morning. Suspicion of embezzlement of roughly $10M. Presumably prior to the recent elections with the company was loaded with socialist Workers' Party appointees. The new governor, Zema, is still talking up sale of assets and eventual privatization later this year. May use this an example of why the state should not be involved in this company. Being fully in the public market would presumably make their accounting more transparent and accountable."

"R$797 million net income on a float of 971 million shares equals earnings of about $0.20 at current exchange rates. With good YOY comps. Short term volatility, but trend and earnings look very good long term. If Zima can get the state out of the business I could see a quick run to $5"
