"""We're at full employment in the field,"" said Sam's Club CEO Kathryn McLay at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit. ""It's probably the statistic that I am most proud of. Our clubs have been at full staffing for probably over three months.""To be sure, Sam's Club being at full employment inside of its roughly 600 stores is the exception rather than the norm right now in retail."
"Amazon slaps a $9.95 fee on Whole Foods deliveries. And Walmart pouncesBy Moira Ritter, CNN BusinessNew York (CNN Business)Whole Foods shoppers may have received a shock this week if they noticed a new $9.95 delivery fee on orders placed through Amazon Prime."
what's the projection of wmt price for end of year the high.
Wow AMZN huge miss! Dont know how will affect WMT….
"With Amazon saying online shopping was slower, let's hope that in store was up."
We received a WMT toy catalog in the mail today. The title is America's Best Toy Shop. That is so true. You can pick out what you want and pick it up at the nearby store. You don't have to wait for the mailman to bring it to you and not know if you will get it or not.
And if you don’t believe fritz about those high paying green energy jobs just refer back the last couple of jobs reports!
"So Xiden is all for less carbon footprint and green energy. But he is flying to Europe on Air Force One with a fighter jet escort, Refueling tanker plane, and a Cargo plane.Why not just sit at the White House and have a few zoom meetings? Less tax dollars too.Repost."
"Even though everyone else is not, Walmart is still committed to going green according to their website.From Statista:Projected growth in United States coal consumption from 2010 to 2030(in million tons)2010 - 1,0512030 - 1,240Gee, so there you go!"
Here's the solution to skyrocketing inflated prices everywhere.Buy as little as possible at highway robbery prices and whenever possible buy nothing at all..They can jack up their prices to the moon but if nobody is willing to pay their sky high prices and be robbed it will all be for naught.
"AMZN jumped 10% last Friday on much stronger than expected September online retail sales data, it's WMT's turn to make similar big move."
WMT to be offering OEM auto parts.
One of the Najarians was just talking about the option action in WMT.
"I did find fish food out at a WMT today. Tomorrow I will go to my regular store. Otherwise, I will have to find something else to feed my fish in my pond outside. Does anyone have a suggestion in case WMT is out of the tall can of fish food. (they are gold fish). When it gets really cold they quit eating, but I need to be feeding them now."
"Bill Ackman says ‘Inflation is clearly out of control Fed should start the taper immediately and begin raising rates as soon as possible’We are continuing to dance oblivious to the rampant inflation while the music is playing, and it is time to turn down the music and let things settle back down."
"I figure if Congress can't agree on where to get the money to give to those who don't achieve like the hard workers do, they will come after those that have stock market gains and get rid of the stepped up basis. Right now that is off the table, but I figure it will come around again."
I am ready to see WMT get to the 170 estimated price for the year!!!! That will make my day.
Paying lawbreakers who were separated at the border 500k ?meanwhilewe have homeless HEREwhen did we enter BIZARRO WORLD?
I love being gone on a short vacation and coming home to find WMT has gone up quite a few points!!!
"Have you guys bought hamburger lately????An updated Consumer Price Index (CPI) released from USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) shows wholesale beef prices climbed 14.2% from July to August of 2021, and price projections point to a possible 20% increase in wholesale beef prices this year."
I bet some people who sold at 150 are regretting bragging about it.
"I wonder why people are getting out of 'the greatest city in the USA? The final months of the year showed an increased movement away from Bay Area cities and into the suburbs. San Francisco experienced “a unique and dramatic exodus,” Holmes said. The city had 35,900 people leave during the last three months of 2020, a jump of 61 percent from the prior year."
"Give this stock a more than generous 20 multiple which is still much higher than its historical average multiple and you get a fair market valuation of $126.So whats the stock doing extremely overvalued close to $150?Is the stock a high growth stock?NO!Is the stock a high margin stock?NO!The stock is that of a low growth, low margin very low end bottom of the barrel retailer that caters to the trailer trash and merits a much, much lower multiple similar to its peers like Target."
I guess the families are taking their profits. Did I read something about how higher prices somehow affect their percentage of ownership in a negative way? They do not seem to want the price to exceed $150.00 for some time.
WMT strong!
Glad I held strong when it went sideways. Now is the time to keep holding long and strong.
Amazon blinked. As of today Amazon will charge a 9.95$ fee for each delivery from Whole Foods Store. Sign up now and Walmart will take 9.95$ off free delivery Walmart+ yearly cost. See details on goggle.
"Who the heck is in charge here!?!?Headline inflation, including food and energy, rose at a 4.4% annual rate in September, the fastest since 1991.Core inflation, which is the Fed’s preferred gauge, increased 3.6% for the 12 months, the same as in August but still also the fastest pace in 30 years."
"Costco raises their starting minimum wage to $17 an hour. Meanwhile, Walmart holds theirs at $12 an hour. Did Walmart not get the memo that people couldn't live on $12 an hour and with the inflation they better ask Walmart if they can take home a big box because that's where they are going to be forced to live?"
Walmart-owned Sam’s Club CEO Kathryn McLay told Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit that members have “already started shopping quite aggressively.”
I can't imagine why wmt is showing up over $2 today since there is no real news that I can see.
"Wait a minute, I thought the WH told everyone the supply shortage crisis was due to too much demand?Q3 2021 GDP+2.0%Q2 2021 GDP+6.7%"

I recently built my own emergency kit containing 51 items and everyone of the products I was looking for Walmart beat Amazon on only 3 items. Either Walmart didn't have my items or they were more expensive for the exact same products. I do NOT like Amazon but they are less expensive.
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Walmart's Mexico unit on Thursday said it focused on its low-price strategy as inflation rose in the third quarter, helping the retailer's net profit rise more than 20%."
It looks like WMT might see more upside today!!!! I need to make a trip to the store today to buy a couple of items. It is nice that the weather is cooler and partly cloudy so I can take the dog and leave in the car since he likes to go where I do but I can't take him in the summer. The trees are starting to turn in the area and it is a good season to be traveling in NW Arkansas.
Maybe the slide is over today!!! I will make a trip to WMT today. It doesn't hurt to stock up when you keep hearing how things are going up and how the supply chain is experiencing problems. Some things don't get out of date-- But a couple of things I need I want to make sure I have them before the time comes== like canned cranberry sauce.
"For the fish food problem----I looked at Tractor Supply site and they had 2 kinds of fish food for pond fish, so I bought that. It is a little big but after being in the water, I feel sure it will fall apart and even the smallest fish will be able to eat. I think WMT being out is a supply issue because two stores were out but they did have tropical fish food."
