"WMT is helping other companies who want to sell on line. That will hurt Amazon as well as WMT, but selling the info can be valuable."
I guess some here would never own Amazon because their dividend is 100% lower than Walmarts.
WMT stock forecast bullish. .Insulin products only add to that.
Walmart go
"Joe said he’s going to make the guy in 1,487,935 pieces pay."
". Near Triple-digit growth in Walmart Connect a new digital advertising platform service was reported last quarter. IMO, Market place, fulfillment, advertising, and digital payments are the higher margin enablers of ecommerce. I feel Walmart will get a increasing share of the digital ad pie. Putting a figure on Walmart's increasing income from brand advertisers digital ads and the use of it's platform to address Walmart's 150 million weekly shoppers is difficult. Brands are aware that ads don't reach customers. However that is not a problem for the closed loop Walmart Connect and that is likely to drive Brand ad spending with Walmart Connect."
unless you understand what the machines are looking for you are out of your league -- this isn't your fathers stock market -- the old rules are still there to give someone a job --CNBC analysts etc all feeding off the uninformed who think they know
Piling in for the dividend that goes ex Thurs. so must own tomorrow. They also report before the open on the 17th.
"I've had to start grocery shopping at WMT lately since I moved to my quiet place, out of the crazy big city recently. I'm fairly impressed with the prices, but WMT needs to expand it's grocery segment more with quality offerings. Some thing are STILL lacking and thank God they still carry Tia Rosa tortillas... throw out that Mission junk. I miss my Big K Diet Root Beer... far better than expensive A&W and apparently the WMT diet root beer was a flop. Expand the grocery business"
I guess with WMT raising guidance we won't see sub 100 again this year.
"Volume 8,264,749 at11:26Avg. Volume 7,732,664"
I bet 46 allowing the federal unemployment benefit to expire next week is going to affect Walmart’s sales going forward.
party on free money -- shorts will have the last laugh --statistically rallies in the week before earnings are met with steep sell offs-- enjoy while you can it will be over soon
Strong earnings report tomorrow? Over 200$ ?
Walmart's PE ratio seems too high for a low margin company. what are your thoughts?
Devastating news for Walmart investors !“Amazon Plans to Open Large Retail Locations Akin to Department Stores”Online shopping pioneer wants a larger retail presence to sell clothing and household items and facilitate exchanges
Down with the major market downturn !! Should been up against the down market. The job report may take it lower. Market will collapse on interest rate increase !!
"Also, Zacks mentions the technical Golden Cross. The news is good on WMT."
Food Stamp benefits will go up 25%in Oct. You know who the largest grocer is.

"Everyone in my neighborhood either shops at Walmart, works at Walmart, or both! What a great company!!!"
"I did stop in WMT today, but I have heard about more virus cases since I have been home so I am going to the WMT site and place an order for groceries for tomorrow. One friend who had the Moderna vaccine in Feb. now has the virus, but is not hospitalized so we have made the decision to start isolating again. So grocery pickup is very helpful to us. cutting out cashiers and using those people to pull groceries for pickup is probably about the same cost."
I heard the Walmart’s in New Orleans is sold out of EVERYTHING!!!
"Ok, I quit. I have rubbed it in enough, but would still like to know how much borrowing 100 shares of wmt to short costs."
"Peny, thanks for the dividend. WMT is looking good again today."
"Peny, feel free to short till your heart's content. Don't be intimidated by a company raising estimates and by good earnings or the government handing out 25% more in Food Stamps in about 6 weeks, or by the government giving parents $300 for each child under 5 and $250 for each child over 5-17 and don't be intimidated by WMT ipo'ing Flipkart which is said to be a double on what they paid. After all, facts don't matter."
TOMORROW WMT WILL BE OVER 160.00
Our chart looks really good.
"It looks like we give back a little today. Oh well, it has been a great few days. I don't like any stock going up too much at one time. A little a day is better in my not so humble opinion."

just something to have an eye out if you are trading this...pretty soon AMZN might be the tail and WMT the dog if you catch my drift...traders are itching to flip the pair trade before they give up the easy gains...think TGT is helping to support this pair trade of traditional big box taking up the slack of online sales and post amazon day blowout
"You have to wonder if this was done on purpose since the CDC says 75% of us didn't get a shot.Yahoo Finance: Why minorities may become collateral damage in NYC's vaccine policy amid Delta surgeThis week, New York City announced new proof of vaccination requirement for residents, visitors and workers in indoor spaces — including restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues — which is opening the door for similar strategies nationwide as the Delta variant of COVID-19 drives up cases worldwide."
"My son-in-law tried to give me a new stock today and I said, ""nope""-- not interested. I am not buying anymore stocks until their is some decision about whether the stepped up basis for inherited assets will be taken away. So instead of investing dividends, I have them transferred to my bank account ($9k a quarter) and I draw it out in $20 bills-- not traceable. And I give it to my children to do whatever they wish. Then, if the stepped up basis does get taken away, I will start giving 15k worth of stock to each of my relatives and hope to get it down so that when I leave the world, it would not be taxed,but it takes a long time to whittle something down that I spent a lifetime building up. I know giving away stock, their cost basis would be the same as mine, but they would not have to sell."
over 15K are hospitalized with covid in florida 8/11/21 says the Fl Hosp association.that's more than 10 times New York States which has a similar size population.more than 2 X California which has almost TWICE the population.... That's how bad it is in fl.

Walmart sales are of the roof. Half the shelves are empty because demand is unreal. Expect stock to test 160

"Michael Burry listed the top 5 stocks to buy. Number 5 was WMT, the others were KHC, MCK, GOOG and FB. I thought Penynostoc said that Burry dissed WMT, but evidently not. That was reported on Insider Monkey"
"The parking lot indicator is a big deal. Even though one person makes fun of me over it. Every WMT I passed on a recent trip all across AR and TN, NC, VA had busy WMT's. I also saw other stores similar to WMT that didn't have many cars in their lots-- like Big Lots. I am even seeing less traffic in Aldi stores. Aldi has a great concept, but I think during the virus, grocery pickup became a safer alternative."
Joe evicted me but also sent $100 wow so generous! I’m living in my Ford $F Econoline van now :( hey but I’m going to buy a whole 0.10 Ford stock! Rest is for cold hotdogs and 0.15 Walmart stocks $WMT

"Ok, after reading numerous sites, I have come to the conclusion that to short a stock, the fee is 3%. Since % is for 360 days, you know someone is probably not going to hold the short for that long so you would have to prorate the borrow fee according to days held. BUT, it isn't free. So besides losing on a short, you do have a borrowing fee to pay. On the green side, if you just go long, you have profits and dividends."

"Peny, you shorted at 145.05 so at this moment you are down about 3.60 a share plus the .55 dividend and the cost to borrow the shares and you are proud of that? Good grief. If you had gone long in Jan. when WMT missed, you would be money ahead and received two dividends and another on the way to be paid in Sept.

WMT should start a cloud company now after AMZN is getting into brick and mortar lol .
Michael who posted yesterday that WMT was never going any higher in anyone's lifetime that is over 50. Amazing that there are so many positive comments by many analysts on WMT's sales.
On iota of soft guidance and market tanks tomorrow.
no stock can over come the technicals that this displays -- find me one stock just one that can stay outside the Bands for more then a week-- this one is now approaching the one week mark -- unless you are saying this is so good that it will defy history this thing is headed south very very soon --once it falls off the upper band cascade selling starts-- could even be today
"""Defunding the police is perhaps the worst idea in NYC government history,"" Democrat Councilman Robert Holden said. ""We can’t legislate using fashionable slogans that fit on protest signs. It hurts every New Yorker. The NYPD are the gold standard for law enforcement around the world. Any issues that need to be addressed require more training, which costs money.""The city, however, disagrees, with de Blasio backing a city council vote in July to slash the police budget by $1 billion. Crime has only worsened in recent months and police response times have grown."
I mean he already told our allies yesterday......
Teachers union says no school this year either!
wmt will require face masks for employees in high risk areas. Good but they should do it for all stores and for customers as well.
WMT had its greatest years of growth during inflationary and recessionary times.
Good day for WMT. Now I wonder when Flipkart will ipo.
Wmt has a HUGE real estate portfolio. Amzn having to purchase or lease property nowadays is not the easiest or cheapest way to compete in B&M. Perhaps they will find another wholefoods who needs to sell? Not worried. It would appear that Amzn is tho!
Amazon opening department stores? Shows the power and need for omnichannel. I have more confidence that CVS will continue to grow in digital health care than Amazon will succeed in bricks and mortar. I am long $cvs and $wmt as I believe both will take share from Amazon in their core segments. CVS has 26% share of prescriptions and growing!! (I was long Amazon until end 2020…..now out except for index funds)

"I have said numerous times on here that it doesn't matter who the president is, Walmart stock does well under democrats and republicans. It's the Walmart economy! Joe has created so much inflation that it is sending people right in the front doors of the Walmart.

"How are ecommerce sales going for Walmart? IMO they were up YOY in 2020 over 60%. That surpassed Amazons growth rate. As a % of revenues ecommerce sales were 2019 7.4% 2020 11.4 %, 2021 Known to be higher. So, Is ecommerce revenues equivalent to adding over 11 more stores? What about same store sales? Are both up and up at accelerating rates year over year and quarter over quarter ? IMO, Yes."
"Walmarts margin has fallen from 4% in 2010 to about 2.4% now. Amazon and others are taking them down. IMO, they should have a PE of 8-10, not 36. If the markets fall, certainly it will fall less than others but I believe this is the highest price WMT will have in the lifetime of anybody over 50."

Reply to $WMT holder asking why they should buy out WISH:1. Walmart e-commerce growth slowed 6% from last quarter and YOY comparison was so poor they won't comment only say they had huge growth vs 20192. Walmart is trying to compete with Amazon who is stealing their market = stepping up online presence. 3. Wish has the 3rd most downloaded shopping app in the world and USA in 2020 and valuable Gen YZ and low income shoppers. 4. WISH has AI technology to create impulse buys they just need better merchants and shipping both of which Walmart has. 5. Wish attracts anti-big business customers and has a fun approach. Walmart has no fun or interesting element to keep shoppers from choosing it over Amazon for e-commerce.

"One to look at I think is Quest Diagnostics. DGX. I just left the clinic where I got my annual checkup and the lab has been closed there because they were having trouble staffing it. (The lab was done by Mercy which also has the hospital in my town) They sold the lab work to Quest. Well, this is a fast growing area and Quest only has a pe of 8+ with a decent dividend and yield and sells for about 150. I am not buying any stocks now, I am giving my dividends away to our kids, but my husband is looking at Quest. He is wanting a new truck, but they are hard to get right now, so he just might use the money to buy some Quest. His truck only has 30k+ miles so it isn't like he needs a new one. We don't travel in his truck so it doesn't get a lot of use. If you want a stock with a low pe, look at Quest."
"The news that WMT has partnered with Adobe for 3rd party sellers to list goods for sale and offer 2 day shipping will be a mind blower for the stock. That's exactly what they needed to compete with their number one rival, AMZN. Look out AMZN-We're at your back door slowly taking future profits. Gas and brick and mortar stores where you can do one stop shopping for food, clothes, electronics, household items, fuel, prescriptions, etc. is a huge plus over the competitions. I think 200 a share is not out of the question within 5 years."

"I'm buying WMT under 149.30 on today's minor pullback. I believe their local delivery service will pick up eventually, but if any delta fears set in primarily with schools where kids under 12 are not vaccinated, I expect some parents will be staying home longer...but moreso, delivery services are here to stay and will only increase going forward. I expect this to be above 150 this week and continue upward momentum. Keep buying. Keep holding."
wmt pays dividend on 9/07.... dont get you scooby doo drawers in a wad
Cramer said to buy WMT just now on CNBC. He bought it in his trust and just broke even but thinks it's on the way up.
All the naysayers on CNBC in 2018 who said WMT was dead money when it was around 85 were all DEAD wrong. Use you head and invest in well known companies with huge market caps that preferably pay a dividend to boot. You can't compare this to AMZN-There's more to WMT than online orders.
Bear trap this morning.
"I really don't like it when a ceo appears on cnbc on a regular basis. I think a ceo should stick to the business and only appear once in awhile. The TGT ceo has to fly to NY to appear and he is doing it on a quarterly basis lately. Also the Ceo of Salesforce appears on Cramer's show often. I just think they either like the limelight or they are promoting their stock. I do own both of those stocks, but I don't go with appearing often. I want them to stick to business. Notice, you rarely see Doug Mcmillon on TV."
"As Penynostoc says, a market plunge is coming, but it is always coming-- just like Christmas. The day after Christmas, Christmas is coming but we investors who invest for the long term are making money. Investing is not hocus pocus, it is finding the best in the market and buying and holding and letting them grow. If you constantly take profits, you don't build up wealth and you pay taxes on the gains. If I sold WMTyears ago, I would not have the gains I have today. So what if WMT isn't a rocket anymore, it is still a wealth creator and I will hold it FOREVER."

"Just a word to you newbees, I have been buying WMT stock since 1978....It made me rich ...Never once have I regretted it. Just a few words of advice, buy and buy and hold and hold and just sit back."
"With WMT’s growing online marketplace of strictly online items that places zero burden on the stores, shipped direct to consumer exactly like Amazon—independent vendors selling through the marketplace can easily switch from Amazon marketplace to Walmart marketplace. I’m sorry if you’re long Amazon but to me this not difficult cascading migration of vendors from Amazon seems inevitable. Amazon has so much to lose, all of which a would be direct gains for WMT. It seems AWS is the only profitable sector that could keep Amazon afloat if that happens. Even then Azure / google are taking a bigger slice each quarter."
In Wal Mart shop lifting is very high but low at AMZN.

"In addition to an inventory build up, walmarts online business growth slowed to a crawl as amazons grew at a much faster rate with amazons revenue likely to overtake walmarts in 2022..“Why Walmart’s e-commerce growth is cooling off while Amazon is still on fire”"
New high for me again today.
"who's got the pulse this morning? ...last time I checked those earnings, latest news on digital advertising and being the defacto ""amazon"" and omni channel outside city centers while competing in the city....was a good thing???"
Another nice day for WMT. Sure glad I know not to short.
We have never had a US president before that has pulled us out of a war with such disgrace as we are facing now.Where we will be knowingly leaving American citizens behind in the country to be killed by the terrorist enemy.
"In Minneapolis, MN where George Floyd was killed, the city cut $8 million from the police budgetToday, Minneapolis homicide rate has an increased 89% year-to-year."
"If you don't own TGT, I think it is a good buy now. It is going to do well the rest of the year."
"Walmart Inc. Director Robson Walton sold a total of 1616821 shares at an average price of $147.08. The insider received $119,843,948.79 as a result of the transaction."
Interesting about Shak's shoe deal with WMT and how many shoes have been sold. He gave up a lucrative deal with Reebok to make a deal with WMT. He didn't want kids having to spend a lot of money on a pair of sneakers.
"WMT calls 145s, 147s, history. Now grinding away at 1.49s and eyeing 1.52s and open skies above that. penystoc, do I have this correct ? Also, I could use a schooling on what these signs may indicate ? I won't feel shorted if you don't care to share."
"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/28/walmart-should-be-under-tighter-scrutiny-because-of-firing-of-employee-with-down-syndrome-eeoc-says.htmlFine with that. If WMT not doing anything wrong, then tighter scrutiny should reveal nothing."
"Remember, despite what all the permabulls say, the market is forward looking."
if you strip away all the free money all retail missed their numbers
Wmt reported inventory build plus lackluster online sales....Hmmmmm
"What % of Walmart's customer base will have 1/4 more money that must be spent on food. So, today a permanent increase in SNAP benefits of 25 % was approved. It is the largest single increase in the program's history. Starting in October, increased SNAP benefits will be available indefinitely to all 42 million SNAP beneficiaries. Twelve percent of the US population receives SNAP. Payments will go from approximately $125 per person per month to 156+. Approximately 18% of all SNAP benefits, or roughly $13 billion annually, are spent at Walmart. Twenty five percent more would be a 3.15 billion increase for Walmart."
"Peny, when the market finally corrects, research some ETF's and pick out one that has some stocks in it that you really like and go long. Quit the shorting stuff. Trading in and out is a losing game. If you had bought TGT when it announced earnings, you would be up about $75 a share. Instead you figured it was over valued and thought it was a good short. I rarely sell. I just accumulate and I do well getting the dividends from them. Do I have any losses? yes, I have a couple, but if I picked well, they will come back. But don't put all your eggs in one basket. I hate to see anyone lose money."
"If I had $50k to invest today, there is no question that a diversified portfolio of stocks in profitable companies would do better over the next 10 years than a set of solar panels. Just saying."
"Most of us have read a recent article, Is Walmart a Buy ? That is a difficult read. Truth twisted, assumption without support, while still pointing out the positives but labeling them as negatives. It did mention Walmart is exploring selling 25% of its roughly 81% stake in Flipkart, according to Mint. The article puts a price on the Flipkart IPO of up 47 Billion. Still this seemed somehow to be a negative. ?"
"Peny, feel free to short more if you don't feel like you have lost enough yet."
"Peny, if you had bought WMt in Jan when it dropped,(around 139) you would be up about $11 a share plus 2 dividends of .55 each per share and another one on the way. Instead, today you are losing on both your shorts and you had to pay the dividend for Sept. Now which is better investing?"
"If you want to read an interesting article about retail--- particularly Target, locate the article about how Target cozy up to the cops. It targets the criminals and you know who they are!!!! It has to do with making a Safe Zone around Targets in the cities. Once you made the list of ner do wells, and you entered the zone, the cameras would pick up on you and you could be arrested for whatever you did--shoplifting, selling drugs, etc. and every time you showed up again, you wouldn't realize you were being photographed and charged again with a crime. It was like big brother was watching you. Soon, you would learn not to be in the center of the city around the Target store making it a safe zone for others. The criminals are the same old ones we all know. 13/90"
What will Tom/Fritz do now?The liberal fact-checking website Snopes was forced to retract dozens of articles after the co-founder was caught in a plagiarism scandal. BuzzFeed News exposed the co-founder for plagiarizing 54 articles between 2015-2019.
"I got a raise! I got a raise! 25%!!! Better then dividends!!!Under the new rules, average monthly benefits, $121 per person before the pandemic, will rise by $36 starting in October, the newspaper reported, adding that all 42 million people in the program would receive additional aid.THANK YOU!!!"
"I do appreciate the shorts having to pay the dividend. Since it goes ex tomorrow, it is a done deal. WMT just might close up today. There is a little mojo in WMT now."
"Not ONE answer.European American 2 days ago WMT conversationOther than the stock market, which is due to cutting corporate taxes, can anyone name something 46 has succeeded with?"
"If Penynostoc had bought WMT in Jan. when the stock went down after earnings, he would have gotten 2 dvidends and about $7 in capital gains and would have another dividend on the way. Investing for the long term is INVESTING. Shorting is gambling and is a losing proposition."
Many items are less expensive at Walmart than some stores or online too
"ok longs please explain how WMT which gets a large portion of their goods from china is going to afford paying shipping container prices which have gone up from 2000 to 20,000 in 3 weeks -- switching suppliers takes years to establish so let's hear it -- pretending this is not a problem won't work"
food stamp company.cheese and bologna
If you haven’t been vaccinated then you should plan to just stay home this week unless you are going out to get vaccinated. Vaccinate or isolate.
"Rise in Walmart+ subscriptions, 25% more food stamp inflows. Looking good for WMT! Good to look past this very sad day in US History, this commander in chief is an embarrassing failure bringing shame to all veterans, allies of the US and we will all remember the deafening silence of his whole administration on vacation while the world watches and laughs. We will move on but never forget Joe’s catastrophic failure."
"Calls at 145$, very unusual volume. If my math is correct Sumo wrestlers are squaring off. Could be interesting. Unexpected results may be possible. Match will play out by 8/13/21."
"Ok, Penynostoc, at the moment doing the math--- you shorted at 145.05 and the stock is trading at 149.20 so that is a loss of $4.15 a share, plus the .55 dividend and yesterday's short is profitable $1.77 so that is a loss of $2.93 a share . I say cover now before WMT recovers more. But you are not alone NonRacistshepherd thinks you are a good investor."
These numbers are not that great. Without stimulus sales would be down huge in US markets. Look at WMT's International sales - DOWN A WHOPPING 15% - and US Online growth has stalled hugely. I again say - INTERNATIONAL WMT SALES DOWN 15%.... LOOK AT THE FINS BOYZ.
It is nice to see the slide in WMT changed. Green is such a pretty color.
Amazon getting into B&M. Looks like a grab for foot traffic from guess who
btw. joe ended the evictions today.a 60 day moratorium is now in place
"What is the Pe story ? A higher P/E ratio shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price today because of growth expectations in the future. Current Pe are in the 20=25 range. Historically the 13-15 range was normal. Even longer ago 7 was considered ok. If you buy only the lowest Pe stocks you will own grave yard stocks. The reason the Price to Earnings ratio is so low is because very few see future value in owning the stock. So, what Pe is most indictive of future stock price appreciation ? I don't know. Do you ? All investors would like to hit it out of the park. But if we don't know what a good chance looks like how can we do that ?"
"WMT was absolutely packed today. I didn't even go in the school aisle. I was in the food section. They have moved everything around inthe remodeling and sometimes you have to ask where something is. A lot of people are doing pickup so there are people in the aisle with carts doing the gathering. Since there aren't cashiers anymore, they have pickup people so they keep moving. I doubt they will be overweight since they walk so much."
"Peny, do you know how much it cost you to borrow 100 shares of WMT to short?"
take away the Gov free money and where is WMT
this board is eerily similar to The Enron Board just a few weeks prior to the big plunge-- in fact if you over lay the 2 charts and you listen to the we can't miss longs you can't tell the difference -- over loved over hyped over pumped by CNBC-- no analyst with a sell rating --internals awful-- WMT the perfect storm
"If the new guy gets all his bills through congress, he'll add $7 TRILLION is spending in just his first year alone! My guess is it will be great for Walmart and why WMT is skyrocketing."
"New high for me--- I hope this holds today!!!! But, usually WMT trades up in the morning and runs down in the afternoon. But, I am certainly glad my mother taught me not to short."
Bitcoins and Walmart to things I do not care for at one time Walmart sold American made goods.
Not sure what is causing this to slide but Walmart’s busiest season is coming up soon and this is a good entry point.
"Recent lows for WMT stock were 130$ and highs 151. Earnings were profit beat of 15% (1.78 /1.56), beat on revenue of 5% (141B/137B), Guidance up 5% on year (6.30/6.02), same store sales up 5.2%. All figures are approximate. I like it and given the many positive drivers I believe stock price direction will be higher in the near term. Todays price movement will be effected by the unwinding of positions taken leading up to earnings."
"last year he released 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison,withdrew U.S. troops down from about 13,000 to 2,500, & failed to repatriate America’s equipment on the ground. but he was very busy last year with election stuff"
"Just remember, one month ago joe was basically declaring victory over the coronavirus. He told people that they no longer needed to wear their masks. One month later we are setting records with coronavirus infections, ICU beds are filling up, people are panicking, and there is no end in sight. Joe said on July 4th weekend that the virus “No longer paralyzes our nation.” Probably the biggest misinformation spread from any politician ever. Now people are dying because joe lied. Thanks joe, at least my Walmart stock is doing good."
Why does MASA always post the exact same thing
if you actually follow Cramer his pics are no better then the market move up or down --someday day soon buying the dip will equal buying the farm oh and how about his famous buy Bear Sterns or Lehman they will be fine one day before they stopped trading forever
"Wasn’t sure how AMZ news would affect WMT…. Guess for now it is assumed to be an insight into WMT earnings? Funny, but I assume WMT is taking share, so can go either wAy. Holding!"
Walmart does have a history of one day gains of 3 to 9% gains on strong earnings reports. At todays price of about 140 that would mean a possible price of 145 to 155.
$155. tomorrow since it just went down with the market today!
for your information I will short another on Monday --typical rallying out of the good into the junk-- the market won't like the earnings it is telling you that on how this has been trading-- but earnings are an excuse to crash it not the reason --stall warning activated--auto pilot disengaged -- you are flying right into the side of a mountain
Looks like Amazon finally admitted Walmart’s business model is better with them now opening stores.
"Yeah, good luck with that!Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan called to rebuild the city’s police force after the area recorded six separate shootings over the weekend.“As a city, we cannot continue on this current trajectory of losing police officers,” Durkan said during press conference on Monday. “Over the past 17 months, the Seattle Police Department has lost 250 police officers which is the equivalent of over 300,000 service hours. We’re on path to losing 300 police officers.”"
The senate passes a test vote on the 1 Trillion $ infrastructure bill with $550 billion going for infrastructure. Where is the rest of the money going? More pork barrel spending with our tax $.
I wonder how much time it will take to get the Walmart’s in Louisiana up and running again?Check your watch!
"I am loving today. Of course I love every day when I am on the right side of the grass. Life is good. Think positive, stay safe and SHOP WALMART."
"Just came across a rather interesting factoid that may interest the long term holders.If you invested $10,000 in Walmart on 8/24/2011, and did NOT reinvest dividends, your investment would now be worth $31,892.36.If you invested $10,000 in Walmart on 8/24/2011 and reinvested all dividends, your investment would now be worth $35,565.23.That's 3,672.87 just for basically doing nothing. Not bad."
I need 37k more to reach a certain milestone and I am hoping Tue. gives it to me.
Walmart stock is pretty much trading where it was back on January 20th.
I keep thinking something big is going to happen to Walmart but it never does. I don't think there is much to worry about WMT collapsing but taking off is about as unlikely.
"TODAYS DAILY DOUBLE, HOME DEPOT AND WALMART BEAT ON EARNINGS."
"Marjorie Taylor Greene’s message to her followers “We’re human, we can’t live forever”. In you and your followers case you can’t live but a few weeks if you don’t get vaccinated."
TGT hit a new high today. Sure glad I didn't short it.
Marketwatch.... “Walmart preview: U.S. sales growth at Walmart could outdo Amazon”
if Walmart beats earnings can we see it at 160+  who's optimistic at Walmart?
"At no time in American history has it ever been more defined of an economy. With joe in there and the rest of the democrats, this is “The Walmart Economy.” Joe is sending people in the front doors of Walmart because he created so much inflation, then he lied about mask wearing which caused a historical increase in coronavirus cases, and now we have people panic buying and we have back to school and we have Walmart parking lots full of cars and we have shopping carts full of groceries."
"THE COUNTDOWN TO 1 MILLION IN WALMART STOCK, 807,456 AND GROWING."
Thank goodness for Walmart!!!NPR - Wal-Mart was able to get essential supplies to rural parishes in Louisiana before FEMA or the Red Cross arrived. The company's logistics and transportation system made it well suited to respond to an emergency like Katrina
walmart always looking for a handout
"Buffett bought more Kroger, so he must think groceries are a place to be and WMT is the largest grocer in the US."
"Is Walmart a growth stock? Fast growth in a business is common to the early entry and success in a new market. Think Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Walmart's early success at discount retail. Walmart's entry into ecommerce is such a opportunity and Walmart has proven it's approach is solid. CFO Brett Biggs said that this high-margin revenue stream “gives us flexibility to invest aggressively for the future”—in other words, the ability to go toe to toe with Amazon. E commerce is a lot bigger deal than it appears on the surface. Hugh revenue streams are involved in multiple connected areas. These revenue streams include ectomeres sales, Platform marketplace, digital advertising, digital payment apps, delivery solutions, and membership fees (included here is everything from music to special packages of apps delivering streaming tv.). So, the question is, How is Walmart addressing these opportunities and is Walmart a growth stock because of that? First ecommerce sales. Walmart's e-commerce sales to increase by 79% in fiscal 2021 after growing 37% in fiscal 2020. Second ecommerce platform. Walmart expects to reach $75 billion in global e-commerce sales by the end of 2021. Third Digital advertising. CEO Doug McMillon and CFO Brett Biggs said that retailer's ad business ""nearly doubled"" in the US during the company's Tuesday earnings call. They added that the number of advertisers running campaigns are up 175% over last year, while advertising-driven sales enjoyed a 95% spike. US digital advertising revenues on pace for $1.55 billion in 2021, up 53.5% for the year and representing 6.5% of US ecommerce channel ad spending Forth Digital payment apps, delivery(recent news) and membership fees may be address later or not? So, what is Walmart's intent ? CEO Doug McMillon recently said, “We weren’t the first place you go to buy products online. We’re trying to change that, obviously.”"
"According to Penynostoc, Thursday after the close some big event happened that would affect this week, but evidently he was wrong again. The Dow is up, WMT is up and I haven't looked at other stocks. Go WMT."
"Yeah, that fixed it!DC leaders struggle with rising crime after cutting police budgetMetropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said last month that staffing in his department was on pace to hit its lowest levels in more than 20 years.Over that same period, the population of the district has grown by more than 20%.A number of factors has contributed to the falling numbers of police officers in the city. Budget cuts last year effectively froze hiring, and, similar to other cities, more officers are quitting the force at a faster pace.Roughly 200 officers and staff left the city’s police department last year."
in 2 years we will have an unstoppable climate disaster-- time to take immediate action now-- global cooling is coming -- ban all EV's -- convert all power plants to coal -- pay farmers to raise beef cattle-- drill for oil while there is still time
Thoughts and prayers for Penystoc. Remember the market can stay ‘rational’ longer than you can stay solvent.
"A blowout quarter anyway you look at it. And yes, your tax dollars just gave us a 25% raise in revenue and profits. Add in the $300 a month cash payment for each child and it looks like smooth sailing with the yearly EPS forecast increased. And on the heels of a HUGE revenue miss at Amazon. Oh, I almost forgot, the $20 BILLION share buyback too! Could see $180 soon. Walmart said Tuesday that second quarter U.S. same-store sales rose 5.2% compared to forecasts of growth of 3.12%. On a two-year stacked comparison, U.S. comp sales grew 14.5%. Operating profit for the division rose at a faster pace than sales (good sign) — 10.6% increase in profits vs. a 2.4% improvement for sales."
you are fighting the internals here you can not win if you are long-- no stock has ever stayed above the upper Band for this long without a total sell off --it's coming you are fighting forces you don't understand
"Good, Peny can short more today. He hasn't lost enough yet."
"Walmart grocery revenue up 6% (2.3 B) YoY. Also this is the second year of 6% growth. Walmart said there will be growth of 11-12% in the US this year. Walmart will buyback 20 Billion in stock. Amazon will open several tiny (30,000 sq. ft.) department stores in the US."
when you include machine trades guess how long the holding period is for a long stock trade--before you guess remember the machines generate over 95 percent of the volume on the NYSE and in certain time frames it is over 98 percent -- now you also have to add the trading desks which do not hold very long either -- bet you will be shocked -- I know I have been trading for decades and follow some very accurate price models but never even came close with my guess -- take into account the machines trade in nano seconds ---
Wear a mask. Freedom is living not dying.
Double volume on WMT today. Down a nickel is nothing compared to the rest of the stocks.
Wait until Walmart gets more involved with being a primary care provider. It will happen and open up a new line of revenue. Keep rising.
"My WMT is remodeling and I mean REALLY remodeling. They are completely refinishing the floor. They are moving every single shelf and sometimes clear across the store. The paint department was moved from the back to close to the garden center with new counters and the pharmacy went from the middle of the store to the front wall. There is a new area coming and it is going to be something to do with healthcare. It will be right next to the pharmacy. I suspect it will have a nurse practitioner and will do some lab tests, but so far no announcement."
"the surge according to a Doc: 'There are no beds in MO, AR or any surrounding states. So my patients who need transfer for fairly routine care are waiting 1-3 days. That’s days before they can get procedures, tests, or expert consultation. '.......' Couple of docs around here were able to find beds all the way in Colorado. So that’s a $60,000 fixed wing flight in addition to the normal care. '"
"Walmart was a mad house today. People preparing for a hurricane, buying bottled water, bread, canned goods, etc. The cheapest place to refill/replace your propane tank is Walmart. Walmart's propane tank refills are $4 cheaper than anyone else. Plus the gas lines at Sam's Club were full of people filing up there cars and their gas cans."
My WMT was packed this weekend. It is tax free weekend for certain items and I think everyone must be taking advantage of it.
"PENYSTOC GET THE HINT. EARNINGS ON TUESDAY AND THE STOCK IS ROLLING TODAY, WALMART WILL EXCEED ON EARNINGS."
"Nice beat! On course to do $7+ this year. I dont know why a slowdown in e comm is a problem, as for a few months vaccinated folks started going into the stores. I know I did (masked) but now back to wmt pickup exclusively."

"Anjalee Khemlani· Senior Reporter - Yahoo! Wed, August 4, 2021, 5:19 PMAnd CDC data shows a similarly worrying trend nationally: Just 25% of Black Americans are fully vaccinated nationwide, well below virtually every other ethnicity."

if earnings matter like you said this should be up--with everything selling off this should get funds looking for a good home most sell offs of this magnitude find safe havens -- apparently this isn't it 35 PE grocery stores don't qualify as a safe haven

Did you see the story about Walmart paying for college education for their employees. It was great for a good laugh. Have you ever been in a Walmart? I'd say that over 90% of the workers are not even close to being college material. That would be like a nursing home offering free training for their residents that want to train to be marathon runners.
Unbelievable earnings and forecast and it’s red lol
"“NBC News July 28, 2021,Two more whistleblowers have come forward to allege that children were mistreated by contractors and senior federal employee managers at a Department Health and Human Services migrant shelter in Fort Bliss, Texas, earlier this year, and also say HHS told them to downplay hundreds of Covid infections among children held at the facility.‘Covid was widespread among children and eventually spread to many employees. Hundreds of children contracted Covid in the overcrowded conditions.”"
"See example below of HOOD founders— re “transfer” tax or “wealth tax” that Dem claim will put burden on elites and use as patsy for upcoming money printing campaign. Like always, it is a virtue signalling illusion that will end up in penalizing the lower class the most through crippling inflation, with very modest actual tax penalty to wealthy unaware of loopholes, and 99.9% of ultra wealthy elites easily sidestepping with creative accounting loopholes. While engaging in inevitable loopholes, the inflation disaster to low/middle class only serves as a massive reward to large property holding elite appreciating real estate prices exponentially dwarfing any taxes left not sidestepped.“both Tenev and Bhatt, 36, have put some of their Robinhood shares in a trust that’s controlled by the other person. Bhatt has allocated more than 3.7 million shares -- 5% of his total stake -- to two grantor-retained annuity trusts, which allow him to pass on share price gains to beneficiaries without incurring wealth-transfer taxes.”"
"And just think, besides getting capital gains today, WMT pays the dividend in about 3 weeks. The dividend may not seem much at .55 a share, but that means over 9k to me."
"In 2012, a letter surfaced, written by a former music executive said to be privy to a “meeting that changed rap music forever.” The letter says that music executives met in LA, were told that their labels had invested in private prisons, and would be pushing violent rap in order to influence people to commit violent crimes (and hence boost the proceeds or private prisons)."

"Why are there blackouts in California? Last summer's rolling blackouts were the result of inadequate supply-demand planning as well as market issues, California's grid operator confirmed. The incidents last summer captured national attention, with sole blame the state's high levels of solar capacity for the issue."
"New High for me. It is nice to see a new high while I was our incurring a big bill to fix my RV. The water pump went out as I was driving to get the tires aligned. I could not imagine what the symbol was so I pulled over and got the book out and determined it was ""coolant low"" so I drove to the dealer and of course you have to wait for it to cool off to be checked out. As it turns out it was the water pump so I incurred a 1434 bill to replace it and the thermostat but of course you know the parts aren't there so it has to be ordered so I needed a ride home. So, WMT brightened my day of having to sit in the waiting room for about 4 hours. After looking on line at water pumps-- they are cheap, but when I looked at a You tube on how to replace one, gee, they almost dismantled the whole vehicle, so 1434 sounds very reasonable. Thank goodness for WMT keeping me in money."
Great closing price today and green post market too!!
I rarely watch Cramer in the evening but someone I know does and he said Cramer had a chartist on the other night and he said WMT was similar to Costco and WMT will break out and go to $170.
"Analysts are expecting WMT stock to be back at new all-time highs over the next 12 months. Average price target amongst 32 analysts covering the stock is $164.50, representing a 16% upside from current levels."

"Visa is right at its all time high. The Olympics should help it too. I am glad most of our V is in a Roth because even if the stepped up basis goes away under the Democrats, it won't affect the profit from V and we bought it the day it ipo'ed and it has split since then."
Looks like we give back some today. Nothing goes up in a straight line or down in a straight line.
"PENY,I suggest you get a real job. Give up shorting stocks since you lose money doing that and you can't pick the good shorts. The Chinese ones would be perfect, but you are hung up for two whole years on WMT. If you get a real job, you could start buying some etf's to grow your wealth. Otherwise, you will just wind up with nothing. It isn't rocket science to get nice profits in a bull market, but you haven't figure that out."
Looks like Penynostoc is losing money today. You can lead a horse to water............................................
"The fed is about to start tapering and that should put a damper on the market, which is good. It has been on a roll. With Food stamps about to increase that will help WMT since it is the largest grocer in the country and that money can only be spent on food. Flipkart is also on the horizon and that will help WMT. I figure most back to school money was spent in August and that won't show up until WMT's next quarter. I look for good numbers."
"Peny, I look for WMT to be down some today so maybe that will save you from putting on another short. You already owe enough so you shouldn't be looking to get further in the red."
The parking lot indicator-- (that I like so well) says Lowes is a BUY. I was there today and the parking lot was a disaster. Some poor guy hauling a trailer really had a tough time trying to find a pull through spot for his truck and trailer.
Nice day for WMT. Paypal is rocketing up.= Too bad I sold Paypal. It didn't go anywhere for about a year and I got disgusted with it and sold.
Amazon crashing in pre-market on HUGE sales miss. And some of you though Amazon was taking Walmart's business.
"When I got vaccinated the first day it was available to me, I simply logged onto my health providers portal and made an appointment for later that day. When I showed up , ALL they REQUIRED was my ID. In my case I used my drivers license. My guess is that people who don’t have proper identification are having a difficult time getting vaccinated, IF they even want to. I would urge EVERYONE to get vaccinated."
I still would like someone to tell me how much it costs to borrow 100 shares of WMT to short.
"WMT has so many things going for it. Don't get discouraged. Just hold your shares and collect dividends and it will perk up. Snap 25% increase coming, Flipkart ipo coming, payments for children till the end of Dec. coming. Where else can you get everything you want under one roof? Plus you can order on line and you can do grocery pickup--which reminds me I need to place an order."
Wmt is a safety stock and a rotation to them has already begun. This is a very good place to be.
"Solar panels require zero maintenance, rain cleans them and leaves don't stick to glass considering the panels are laid at between 30 and 45 degrees. If you were to finance the purchase and use the money you used to spend on your old monthly electric bill you would own the panels in a few years. Solar clearly is the cheapest way to produce electricity"

Once lockdown Utopias like SF / NY have obliterated all small businesses / retail I could see AMZN physical department stores doing ok. Maybe that has been part of the plan all along…
Joe puts Americans in danger on a daily basis. VOTE BACK BETTER!
for those who think they track me-- know this I shorted again this morning --and NO I did NOT cover any---long had their chance to sell some and be prudent but they chose to live in a fantasy world --market crash on the way and WMT will fully participate in the sell off- at max short here --
Nice close for WMT on a down day for the Dow.
"I’m in awe, Walmart is really picking up momentum in the online realm, at this pace as extreme as it sounds, I can easily see WMT making Amazon Irrelevant sometime in the future. Just for the hell of it I decided to look on the WMT app for the Mass Loaded Vinyl I need and other obscure items/materials for a soundproofing project. WMT not only has such an obscure item as MLV and all the other tools I needed but in the higher 1.5lb density that I could NOT find on Amazon, for a cheaper price in bulk quantities shipped for free! That was not a WMT purchase I’d think I’d ever make. WMT is starting to not just match but regularly BEAT AMZN in quality and price for online items in addition to the convenience of the gargantuan retail stores. Never been more bullish!!"
"Peny, the trading desk must not be very busy this morning since you have posted every couple of minutes. Maybe you should retrain for a new occupation. WMT is hiring."
WALMART joining a growing number of major corporations exploring the viability of digital currencies like BITCOIN!!!
"Penynostoc needs a new crystal ball. His is cloudy or cracked. If you can't pick stocks, you need to buy etf's. He has lost on WMT and he said he shorted at 145.05 and he will owe the dividend and he owes to borrow shares of WMT. He also has bragged about shorting TGT. TGT raised guidance and it has screamed higher ever since it reported."
WMT tends to run up in the morning and sell off in the afternoon. I hope we can hold the gains today.
"Does anyone know if Walmart sold any of this?862,000 pounds of meats sold by Costco recalled. There’s a salmonella outbreak"
"TGT is doing nicely today, too. Nothing like getting free money from the government."
This company is not a high growth or even a high margin company that merits a high growth multiple that is normally only res4erved for the high growth high margin companies.WMT is a low growth low margin very low end retailer that merits a much lower multiple like its peers have.Look at TGT still with its historical multiple in the teens just as WMT has always had.This for ray WMT has had up into a high growth high margin multiple that it certainly doesn't merit will eventually pass and it will return to its historical multiple in the teens that all low growth low margin retailers like WMT and its peers merit.
Social security likely to be raised 6.2 % this year. On a 1700 a month check that is 105.20 extra a month. Walmart gets more than 10% 0f all retail spending. Normal social security raises don't even cover the yearly increased cost of Part B Medicare insurance. Oct1 will see if this is true. This would be by far the largest raise in 24 years. Do you believe ?
149.75 after hours. 
Maybe we can get the landlord of our apartment complex to install quick chargers too for everyone in my neighborhood driving electric cars.
"Actually, WMT is not down as much as the dividend (.55) so we are still money ahead. Thank Peny for paying the dividend for us."

Amazon’s huge miss is dragging the futures way down. At least Jeff got his!

"There are lots of positive headlines under WMT. --- Insulin will add to the bottom line, WMT might outdo Amazon, etc. Life is good!!! I just left WMT and the school supply aisle had lots of boxes that showed clearly that people had been shopping big time. I will be glad when the remodel is over. This whole town is remodeling everything and I am very tired of it."
"They were talking utility companies on CNBC and I think every long term portfolio should include some because with the push for EV's power usage has to go up. Sam's Club has charging stations but I haven't seen any in a WMT lot yet. But this area is not really into EV's. There are quite a few hybrids around but not EV's. When you travel in your car, you don't want an EV because of charging problems. If you live in a city and just go back and forth to work, an EV works great."

"Super nice day for Walmart share holders. I mean, for those that aren't shorting. lol"
"New high for me. It pays to be long the market. I figure tomorrow, I will have another new high. I think WMT beats by 13 cents. There are too many pluses with the SNAP benefits going up 25%, the child credit of $300 for children under 5 and $250 for those between 6 and 17. Then Flipkart ipo'ing sometime later. The good stuff just keeps coming!!! Mexico's sales are good."
Remember me ? I warned you when wmt reported earnings that it was going lower due to Inventory buildup Big slowdown in Online sales It dipped initially then to fool investors they let retailers buy it up to 153 then they Now it is being sold by big players even as the market hits record highs...Many were snookered....140 will be tested imo soon..
"Burning fossil fuels, especially coal is from another era. Coal pollution and coal ash are going away and new cleaner tech is replacing it.

"I see the future in trading crypto market, especially bitcoin with the high rate of move from the market. Its quite encouraging the aim is earning enough and consistent investment matters a lot with proper portfolio one can make millions in a month depending on your investment and your directive. Trading bitcoin is a lucrative way of making money online."
"What will child tax credits payments mean for Walmart ? The IRS says that 39 million households that contain 90% of the children will receive 110 billion with 55 billion of that paid out throught the monthly payments starting July 15 and ending Dec. 15. So, that is the pie. Walmart's cut of all retail spending in the US is 10.2 %. If Walmart gets only their share sales should increase in the July to December time frame by 5.5 billion."
I'm trying to look in the earnings report did Walmart buy out Zest technology? That's the food tracking system there in the big lawsuit with and lost. Walmart and the IBM food trust need the technology for Walmart Eden food tracking system that has ZEST technology embedded in it. And IBM food trust $170 members I believe have been using the Zest tech as well

"Walmart near me sometime I see empty shelves and fridges , I thing more peoples are visiting walmart"
CVS is just the latest in a long line of companies that announced that they are raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour. When will Walmart do that? They could at least follow suit of all the companies raising their minimum wage to $15 and at least pretend that they care about the workers that are the reason they can keep their doors open and operate as a business. Without the workers they have no business.
"Worth reiterating that WMT stock forecasted to be back at new all-time highs over the next 12 months. Average price target amongst 32 analysts covering the stock is $164.50, representing a 16% upside from current levels."

It's been going up too fast. Looking forward to buying this back on the earnings dip.
I think school shopping will benefit WMT. You can't shop for children's shoes on line. And it is easier to return stuff in person rather than ship it back.
"July ends the WMT quarter. So if you are buying something big, buy before the end of the month."
I hope the slide today is over.
I believe that in the near future Walmart plus can beat amazons one.
WMT trading high volume today.

"Just like all the other free money they printed to prevent a revolution this year, a lot of the infrastructure bill's frivolous billions will wind up at Walmart. All money eventually trickles down to Walmart, Krogers, Lowes, Home Depot, and electric utilities. Dems make the rich richer and the poor poorer by everything they do. I don't like it, but have learned to see it how it really is. So buy more stocks like WMT and win."
PS5 and Xbox Series X stock at WMT.
Nice day for WMT.

"The people I talk to actually have solar panels and it does not save them $300 per month. It saves them about $100 per month on average and we live in a mostly sunny climate. You also are not considering the maintenance. You need to pressure wash those things regularly and/or blow the leaves/pine needles off of them and I don't see Ms. Sally going up on that roof and doing that. Maybe her husband does that or they pays someone to do that which is an added expense. Ron, 6% interest? Nobody gets that from a savings account or money market so where did you get that number? At the end of the 20 years, the solar panels may have some salvage value, who knows? If you had invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks, you could have collected dividends over the course of the 20 years and sold the stocks at that point for who knows how much, but not salvage value unless you just can't pick stocks. I have had some stocks double my money in less than a week. It is cheaper for me to just pay the electric utility to supply my power, that's their business, that's what they do."
No sub 100 today either.
Who cares if COST is growing much faster and is at 52 week high?
"Penynostoc must not have any money left to trade since he posted on here all day. I was gone from about 10 30 to now and good grief, he was posting every few minutes. Too bad he doesn't know how to invest. I have made a ton of money since the first of the year while he has been shorting WMT."

"Peny, short to your heart's content. I have made money today and even if WMT drops 5 points tomorrow, you will still be slightly in the hole on your last short. However, I look for WMT to hit about $154 tomorrow. There is too much money being given out. Most people spend easy money. If you work hard for it, you tend to hold onto it, but easy money gets spent."
"How about this headline by Zacks, ""Why Walmart is a good long term old."""
longs are fighting forces they don't; understand -- it is not about earnings sales upgrades down grades price targets analysts cars in the parking lots full shopping carts --none of that matters at all-- machines generate 95 percent of the volume do you really think they car about that-- the average machine trades lasts under half a second in and out that fast-- you are fighting the machines -- all the other junk is there to give someone a job
This is going to get ugly.A separate report from the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the big monthly hike in consumer prices translated into negative real wages for workers. Real average hourly earnings fell 0.5% for the month

Every roof. Yeah. Like my landlord is going to put solar panels on our roof so we don’t have to pay an electric bill after no one has paid him for the last year and a half.

I doubt WMT closes down as much as it is in premarket. The results were great.
July was officially the hottest month on record ever on Earth. Italy just recorded the hottest ever temp in Europe of 120 degrees
Our resident shorter is down on both his recent shorts. Surely he covered.
Markets have changed this isn't the buy and hold your grand father used to accumulate wealth -- you trade or you ultimately get taken out-- markets started the transition around 1980-- Japan was the last buy and hold market and that crashed in 1980 --it is still down 50 percent and never recovered --that was the ultimate market in the 70's you could not miss-- Japan was going to take over the world --shorting it was considered the height of folly- well over 40 years later and they are still down 50 percent -- you can never say never in the markets something someday will take WMT out-- a rather permeant 50 percent drop or more-- the markets have changed adapt or die -- you make the call
I will hit another new high today if the market holds up where it is now and I absolutely love WMT to be up on a Friday. ---Then you get to see a new high all weekend. You don't have to hit a home run on all stocks. It only takes one that you hang onto that makes you wealthy!!! Go Walmart!!!
Pressure to over spend on school supplies may be helping WMT for school supplies!!!! With $250 for each child from 6 to 17 that should really help.

"Good day for WMT. I like it when WMT is up on Friday, then it looks good all weekend."
"Walmart shares are going to hold up and are definitely not a short. The idea that Flipkart will most likely be ipoed in the fall or early next year, plus the free money you get for having a gazillion kids will help WMT. If you don't have a ton of money, you probably don't have an Amazon account, so you will probably spend money on your kids at WMT as it gets closer to school starting. It may not show up in this quarter which ends July 31 but August should be a big spend month for those with children as school will be starting."
"During this year’s Python Challenge, a record 223 invasive pythons were removed from the Everglades. It’s progress towards helping the native ecosystem there in South Florida."

"Also, what is keeping WMT from expanding into HD/Lowe’s territory with lumber / bulk construction materials sales? The sheer mass of primely located real estate that Walmart has eaten up over the century all over the US is just asking for it, all of which is giant warehouse/store space. WMTs are usually right next to HD and Lowe’s anyway, and have already started to expand heavily into power tools etc. they don’t carry Miluakee yet, but Techtronic Industries TTNDY which owns them, also sells its other brands like HART, Hoover at WMT so it’s only a matter of time before WMT eats into HD / Lowes."
