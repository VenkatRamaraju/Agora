Double volume on WMT today. Down a nickel is nothing compared to the rest of the stocks.
NY total death rate was SO BAD they had to segregate NY / NYC as completely separate. OUCH that’s embarrassingly bad

C'mon. Walmart is a good company that will turn profits for years. Why is stock down? Go long on this one and buy now. Have you been to walmart...one stop shop...you go in for one thing and end up buying much more.
"WMT will do at least 2x as well in FL than NYC. 2x covid death rate in NYC , as per 8/30/21 CDC cumulative death rate per capita during the course of the pandemic. #1) NYC 401.74 (covid deaths / 100k)#2) NJ 301.8 …. Florida 207.44"
WMT is recovering in premarket and I figure some upgrades will be coming since WMT raised. There was nothing not to like in the report.
"Is Walmart a growth stock? Fast growth in a business is common to the early entry and success in a new market. Think Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Walmart's early success at discount retail. Walmart's entry into ecommerce is such a opportunity and Walmart has proven it's approach is solid. CFO Brett Biggs said that this high-margin revenue stream “gives us flexibility to invest aggressively for the future”—in other words, the ability to go toe to toe with Amazon. E commerce is a lot bigger deal than it appears on the surface. Hugh revenue streams are involved in multiple connected areas. These revenue streams include ectomeres sales, Platform marketplace, digital advertising, digital payment apps, delivery solutions, and membership fees (included here is everything from music to special packages of apps delivering streaming tv.). So, the question is, How is Walmart addressing these opportunities and is Walmart a growth stock because of that? First ecommerce sales. Walmart's e-commerce sales to increase by 79% in fiscal 2021 after growing 37% in fiscal 2020. Second ecommerce platform. Walmart expects to reach $75 billion in global e-commerce sales by the end of 2021. Third Digital advertising. CEO Doug McMillon and CFO Brett Biggs said that retailer's ad business ""nearly doubled"" in the US during the company's Tuesday earnings call. They added that the number of advertisers running campaigns are up 175% over last year, while advertising-driven sales enjoyed a 95% spike. US digital advertising revenues on pace for $1.55 billion in 2021, up 53.5% for the year and representing 6.5% of US ecommerce channel ad spending Forth Digital payment apps, delivery(recent news) and membership fees may be address later or not? So, what is Walmart's intent ? CEO Doug McMillon recently said, “We weren’t the first place you go to buy products online. We’re trying to change that, obviously.”"
Amazon opening department stores? Shows the power and need for omnichannel. I have more confidence that CVS will continue to grow in digital health care than Amazon will succeed in bricks and mortar. I am long $cvs and $wmt as I believe both will take share from Amazon in their core segments. CVS has 26% share of prescriptions and growing!! (I was long Amazon until end 2020…..now out except for index funds)
"President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I. I want results."" January 2 (Cabinet Meeting)Trump is talking about former Defense Secretary James Mattis, who resigned in protest in the wake of Trump's decision to pull US troops out Syria. Trump didn't ""essentially"" fire him. At all."

"WMT has so many things going for it. Don't get discouraged. Just hold your shares and collect dividends and it will perk up. Snap 25% increase coming, Flipkart ipo coming, payments for children till the end of Dec. coming. Where else can you get everything you want under one roof? Plus you can order on line and you can do grocery pickup--which reminds me I need to place an order."
"And just think, besides getting capital gains today, WMT pays the dividend in about 3 weeks. The dividend may not seem much at .55 a share, but that means over 9k to me."

wmt pays dividend on 9/07.... dont get you scooby doo drawers in a wad
Not sure what is causing this to slide but Walmart’s busiest season is coming up soon and this is a good entry point.
"Walmart was a mad house today. People preparing for a hurricane, buying bottled water, bread, canned goods, etc. The cheapest place to refill/replace your propane tank is Walmart. Walmart's propane tank refills are $4 cheaper than anyone else. Plus the gas lines at Sam's Club were full of people filing up there cars and their gas cans."
I bet 46 allowing the federal unemployment benefit to expire next week is going to affect Walmart’s sales going forward.
Holding long and reinvesting dividends. Go WMT!!
Walmart's PE ratio seems too high for a low margin company. what are your thoughts?
"I'm buying WMT under 149.30 on today's minor pullback. I believe their local delivery service will pick up eventually, but if any delta fears set in primarily with schools where kids under 12 are not vaccinated, I expect some parents will be staying home longer...but moreso, delivery services are here to stay and will only increase going forward. I expect this to be above 150 this week and continue upward momentum. Keep buying. Keep holding."
