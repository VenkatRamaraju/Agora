These high prices almost feel like a tax to our family. Barron’s: Central Bankers Are Spooked by Signs That Inflation Is Lingering for Longer
Stock markets up on fact taxes won't be going up anytime in the near future.
"The problem with Walmart is that it's not growing its e-commerce the way it should. People have Amazonish expectations on Walmart, and it's not showing that potential."
$WMT bounced perfectly off the downtrend resistance on the 3Month chart. Up around 30% so far on my 10/8 139P's from lunchtime. Good luck at the open tomorrow everyone!
"Up $1,650,000 today on my fake WMT portfolio that I bought at $1.WMT has great BIG parking lots for RVS and planes.I think most of their customers drive cars."
Walmart leases container ships to help get products into the country. Better late than never I guess. Costco leased container ships and containers several weeks ago and Amazon has been running their own container ships for almost three years.
"Under normal circumstances, the backlog at the ports would be an inspiration for companies to start making all the foreign goods here in America. Trouble is they would have trouble finding workers to help manufacture the product. “Let’s go Brandon”"

"I sure wish China would be more like Walmart! Walmart plans to be ZERO emissions by 2035!Source: Walmart - We power around 36% of our operations with renewable energy. Roughly 70% of the energy consumed in China is obtained from coal, making it one of the most coal-reliant countries in the world."
why WMT is moving opposite to the market? anyone to explain
"Zacks says WMT is the bull of the day. At least someone else thinks WMT is a good place to be besides me. WMT is THE place to shop for most everything. I would bet money if a survey was taken with RV'ers, they would say their favorite stopping place for any needed items would be WMT. WMT sells the most groceries, their parking lots are big to accommodate Rv's and they sell some needed RV items and they have gas stations at most of the WMT's. I am going RV'ing next week and I know I will be stopping at some in the areas I am going. The fridge in my RV is small and that necessitates planning ahead and making frequent stops. Plus if by chance someone can't get a campground, you can stay in a WMT parking lot in most locations (unless the city has an ordinance to protect the private campgrounds). However, I have yet to camp in a WMT lot, but it is on my bucket list just so I can say I did it."
The dividend will prob. show up tomorrow in brokerage accounts. At least it will in mine since Monday is a holiday and it is paid on Tue.
Thoughts on WMT stock price anybody?
"Now SQUID merchandise in conjunction with Netflix just in time for the Holidays. Good idea. Better idea Walmrt, Netflix is to arrange dates with the Korean actresses currently starring in your KDramas and charge what Jeff Bezos is charging for a trip into space. I'm sure William Shatner would have preferred a 3 minute ride with Shin Min-Ah than in some dusty rocket ship."
"Is Walmart worth a buy a $139.I think we have to remember that the expected upper end earnings are 135 to 150 and the next years earnings growth is just about 7.39% more.Which is not bad, but the fact is that it is trading at a PE of 39 and not 9 is a wonder for this goliath.I say PE OF 9 because most companies with growth less than 8 % are dangerously priced in this current markets and historically they trade at PE below 10 or 12. So even if it goes down to the PE of 19, I fear I will have to take a big shaving. If you feel other wise and think that it is worth the risk please let me know. There is a lot of millennials enthusiasm right now and people saying that if the markets fall so what we will hold it for ever, but then when reality sets in we still have to test the prudence of this millennials. So far what I noticed is that when things do not go their way they easily leave even their parents and never return."
All the shelves at our Walmart are fully stocked. I asked a friend who works there if they ever got empty and she said “no they restock them every hour!
Walmart has the BEST selection of ice cream anywhere so at our apartment when it’s ice cream time we go to Walmart!

"IMO and only a opinion, this announcement is indicative of major happenings. Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer of Walmart Inc., will participate in a discussion at the Goldman Sachs 28th Annual Global Retailing Conference on Thursday, Sept. 9 at 11:40 a.m. EDT."
If you can't feed them don't breed them.Its not the US taxpayers responsibility to support every single family in our country that has kids.Its the responsibility of the people that decided to have those kids to support them its not the responsibility of the US taxpayers to support them.To hades with all these taxpayer resources going to these families just because they decided to have kids.
"Back to a Democrat market today. Hold onto your seats, it will be a rocky ride."
GS will be a rocket today and it pays a good div. It pays to buy when no one wants a stock like during the financial crisis a few years back.
I love Netflix. Especially the DC special.Walmart and Netflix Team Up for Exclusive New Retail Hub That Will Bring Popular Stories to Life
Walmart hired two Goldman Sacks executives who have created a Walmart fintech startup. In other news Sam's grandson is backing a healthy foods effort with big plans.
"California...Land of ????. Famous Proposition 47 doesn't make shoplifting legal as exaggerated reports claim, it does downgrade thefts under $950 from a felony to a misdemeanor. Really ? Will that work ? So, what kind of place is California ? Better question is, What kind of place will it become ? Walmart should think twice about California."
I see Walmart hitting 138 by week end and hopefully it holds based of 120 day m.a
Just as in any household the only way to prevent a financial disaster from happening to our country is to stop the massive borrowing and spending of trillions upon trillions every single year of money we don't have and can not afford to keep doing.Hopefully the financially responsible people left in congress like Joe Manchin and the republicans can stop the Joe Biden socialists from borrowing and spending us into a financial collapse.If the remaining financially responsible left in congress can not stop the never ending massive borrowing and spending then other more drastic options have to be looked at like refusing to raise or national debt limit and if need be defaulting on our debt payments. One has to look at ugly options like defaulting on our national debt as less severe than a full blown financial disaster with a collapse in the value of the US dollar from a forced bankruptcy from our national debt being so high that the interest payments can no longer be made because of higher interest rates..

I would think defense stocks might be a place to put some money with China doing fly overs on Taiwan. Taiwan might be willing to buy something to keep China thinking twice about trying to take it over and all the defense stocks pay good dividends.

"For anyone who doesn't know how free lunch in schools works, it is totally abused. All you do is look at a form that has the limits for free or reduced lunch and see if your income fits in one or the other category and you check which one. No tax return required, no one checks. It is your word. Then at mid term, 3% of those getting free/reduced lunch have a random computer drawing to ""check"" to see if income levels have changed. So, 3% are called with the question, ""Has your income status changed since the first of the school year?"" and if the answer is no, that ends the conversation. My area has very low unemployment but has very high free lunch. That tells you people are dishonest and want something free. That can be fixed. If everyone had to show their tax return, it would stop!!! it could be a job of about 3 people who approve free/reduced lunch taking the pressure off the schools to distribute the forms. There is a better way!!!!!"
Looks like the markets sure like the fact that taxes aren't going up anytime soon!
Simple math:3% (GDP growth) - 6% (inflation) = -3%
I picked up a few more shares of BABA today. I am hoping Xi is busy frightening Taiwan and will quit terrorizing their tech industry.
"I'm just glad I use public transportation! Do you guys think Walmart will raise prices due to this?U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $1.17, or 1.5%, to settle at $80.52, after touching its highest since late 2014 at $82.18."

Sold all my shares. The shoe does not fit!!!! Market moves 900 points and WMT even. 5% gain in 52 weeks while market up almost 40%. Enough is enough!!!!
How many will hit unemployment tomorrow?about another 350k? joe gets things did
"Way oversold, it's going back up above $140 in no time."
The pre market on WMT has really flipped around.
Walmart has always had a hard road but they use the Chinese model of no growth. This is not a model of capitalism by any means. They just don't get it. This stock has only slowly moved since its inception. Its because of its original model.
Keep in mind that WMT gets about 10% of the retail dollars.
Inflation around the corner. Everything is going to go to walmart.

"Surely we will get to hold onto some of WMT's premarket gains today. The banks are all reporting good numbers. They have been a place to be this year. None are rockets, but they do all pay dividends."
walmart is remodeling stores to upgrade them with advanced in-store and digital innovations.
Are there people that actually think this stock is going down below $130? Lol
"When Flipkart ipo's, WMT should take a jump up. Their profit in Flipkart is about a double according to the analysts."
"listen, people who shop at whole paycheck will see the 30-40% increase in their food bill and will start to come on over to Walmart and be shocked at the cheap prices. I don't think I've ever had sticker shock at Walmart"

Another bad day at the office. Poor Kohls. That one is getting crushed today.
"More great news for Walmart!Initial unemployment claims, week ended September 18: 351,000 vs. 320,000 expected and a revised 335,000 during the prior week Continuing claims, week ended September 11: 2.845 million vs. 2.600 million expected and a revised 2.714 million during the prior week"
At $110 the stock is at its high end of its fair value and at $100 its a strong buy.
"Does anyone know if this is one of Walmart’s suppliers?Oct. 13—PEABODY — A Peabody meatpacking company whose brands include Bell and Evans chicken and Certified Angus Beef will no longer recognize or negotiate with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which had won an election last year to represent full and part-time production and maintenance employees."
This is a good start. Now let's keep it up.
Walmart cannot keep shelves stocked. An employees said it was because they could not hire workers. I suspect there may be supply issues as well. How will be grow the revenue with sales unless they just jack up prices. I do not get a very warm fuzzy here today.
Wmt tuition program for employees is pretty great.but Amazon is better.. 20% more money for tuition$1.2 billion for amzn compared to $1.0 billion for wmt

There's no need to raise the debt ceiling if we just live with in our means.The US treasury has ~ $350B /MO of incoming tax revenues.If we simply chose to spend no more than our incoming revenues of $350B /MO we will never have to raise the debt ceiling again.The same thing that every household in our country eventually has to do .Its just when our despicable members of congress want to continue to spend trillions more than our incoming tax revenues do the monetary problems arise.The solution is very simple.Just stop spending extra trillions upon trillions every single year that we don't have and can no longer afford to do.

"These stock markets are bending but all signs point to the markets breaking hard in the coming weeks. Lock in profits NOW is the best advice you will ever receive. Remember, its a lot more painful to stay in the markets through the ups and downs because if you go back 40 years and look at the best up days and the worst down days, the down days will destroy your up days, leaving you with big losses. You will make money in the long run by always staying in the markets but you will have a much smaller amount of money than if you get out and be patient when signs are pointing to a big break down in the markets. After you go back and check the past 40 years, one thing will be very obvious and that is the down days are much larger than the up days. That's just how markets work. Always have, always will."

If ya guys think wmt isn’t worth buying then don’t! Buy another retailer. If you want to compare forward PE then fine. Price per sales is another value to look at. Wmt wins hands down on that. My 2021 target is 160. Got a few months to go…. Most of the pros put it above that. I like tgt but no longer own it. I like Wmt for a lot of reasons which is good cuz I got a lot of it!

Lets get this stock back down to a much more reasonable and historical multiple again where it belongs and is buyable again.Right around $100 is a reasonable price to pay for this.
"Is Walmart a growth stock? Fast growth in a business is common to the early entry and success in a new market. Think Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Walmart's early success at discount retail. Walmart's entry into ecommerce is such a opportunity and Walmart has proven it's approach is solid. CFO Brett Biggs said that this high-margin revenue stream “gives us flexibility to invest aggressively for the future”—in other words, the ability to go toe to toe with Amazon. E commerce is a lot bigger deal than it appears on the surface. Hugh revenue streams are involved in multiple connected areas. These revenue streams include ectomeres sales, Platform marketplace, digital advertising, digital payment apps, delivery solutions, and membership fees (included here is everything from music to special packages of apps delivering streaming tv.). So, the question is, How is Walmart addressing these opportunities and is Walmart a growth stock because of that? First ecommerce sales. Walmart's e-commerce sales to increase by 79% in fiscal 2021 after growing 37% in fiscal 2020. Second ecommerce platform. Walmart expects to reach $75 billion in global e-commerce sales by the end of 2021. Third Digital advertising. CEO Doug McMillon and CFO Brett Biggs said that retailer's ad business ""nearly doubled"" in the US during the company's Tuesday earnings call. They added that the number of advertisers running campaigns are up 175% over last year, while advertising-driven sales enjoyed a 95% spike. US digital advertising revenues on pace for $1.55 billion in 2021, up 53.5% for the year and representing 6.5% of US ecommerce channel ad spending Forth Digital payment apps, delivery(recent news) and membership fees may be address later or not? So, what is Walmart's intent ? CEO Doug McMillon recently said, “We weren’t the first place you go to buy products online. We’re trying to change that, obviously.”"
People love shopping at Walmart. The parking lot is always full. It will report another great quarter. Today is a good day to pick up some shares. The correction is going to end and the market will rev up for Black Friday and Christmas season. This Christmas will be big as people are going to make up for last two years.
I probably would not shop at a Walmart or Target store in Chicago this weekend....or ANY other retailer or grocer for that matter.
"I have noticed at the stores now there are more grocery pickup spots reserved since they just repaved the parking lot and restriped. I see more and more of the order fillers pushing the carts around the store. I think you tend to buy less if you have someone else fill the order, but if you are afraid of the virus, you do what is best. I know someone that broke an ankle and it was a lifesaver for her to have the shopping done. I am sure others who are handicapped find it a valuable service. I notice that the Aldi parking lot is not nearly as crowded as it has been in former years and I wonder if it is because grocery pickup is not an option. Plus handicapped would have a hard time navigating an Aldi store."
Green is such a great color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"WMT is a good place to be at the right price. What happened in the last few years is that due to lower interest rates a lot of people became desperate to invest even to make 1.5% dividend or a quick ride of meager 3% to 10% in profits. However, that is changing fast. We have to see historical ways of doing things as this period is immaterial. The company has reported earnings of about 7%. So that is not great given that we are still at 0% interest rates. This is a steady stock and so long time holders will do well. Moreover, I see Amazon also going into some huge reality based corrections. Many companies bought back their own shares to boost the earning numbers also. So we have to see if they want to do that.I am thinking that government is going to tax those companies that buy their own share above the employee stock grant levels. It could be a special fee and require them to show some real percentage profits before they can do so. Ex. They might be required to pay a filing fee as well as show quarterly profits of 10% or more before they can buy back their stocks with the extra cash for the following quarter. As we all know, once upon a time, such practices were banned for share holders protection, but now politicians want to be rich and they can fabricate policies or keep extending in-appropriate policies in the name of deflation to unemployment to weaker economy, etc., to serve their base on inside information. So shareholders are at risk. As we see even though we call ourselves capitalist we have not paid any thing to the lenders for using their money since financial crisis. We been stealing or we have socialized lending...LOL, but we call ourselves ardent capitalist and hate communists, but that is not the case with communists, right? I am also a democratic person and I prefer fair capitalism in hope that democracy works for all. Hence, I am also learning the power of fancy talk in the modern democratic self serving world that caters to the wealthy and neglects its bottom 65% of population by policy manipulations."
"This is interesting by but really turns me off. My daughter has a new Ford 150 and she wanted an oil change before she goes on her next trip. The Ford dealership was booked up, so she went to WMT and they said they cannot do it because it requires a disposable plug for the PLASTIC OIL PAN. So she went to Autozone to buy a plug to take it to WMT and Autozone said they didn't have the plugs yet because they were so new. So she called the Ford dealership back and chewed on them and they told her to bring her truck in on Friday morning and they would do it after all. My husband said he checked on line and the plastic plug is reusable. But I am totally turn off by a plastic oil pan and my husband has ordered a new truck. I think that is pitiful~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
"Life is lived ""always behind"" or ""always ahead"". The most determining factor of what group you will be in ""is"" the cost of money. Don't pay twice for what you buy, if you want to be in the ""always ahead"" group. Walmart's new ""Affirm"" program could put you in the ""always behind"" group. Instead of layaway, Walmart is shifting to a program called “Affirm.” Billed as an alternative to layaway, Affirm allows people to purchase their items immediately and pay over time in a span of three to 24 months. The process requires customers to apply for a loan to pay for their items and while no late, prepayment or annual fees are charged, customers do pay interest ranging from 10% to 30%."

I own a bunch of pharmas for the dividends. It is hard to get yield out of much else. My husband was joking the other day, he is building up cash in his brokerage account to buy a new truck that he has on order and he has about 35k in cash in the account and he got like 50 cents in interest. That won't even buy a cup of sr. coffee at MCD."
It looks like more profits will be flowing back today.
There is no mojo even though the retail sales numbers were good today. I guess we wait for the Flipkart ipo.
Went to Walmart today. Shelves were stocked and the workers laughing ands scanning cans of green beans just like the old days.Thank you Walmart and thank you Walmart workers.
I am missing Maria's positive comments.
@POTUS getting ready to pump Walmart during supply chain speech...
"You do realize that low end jobs pay more now ??? How much more ? Was 8 to 11$, is now 14 to 17. That is a6$ raise, as a % that amounts to75% raise. We know inflation is unlikely to rise that much. Most Walmart customers have much, much more to spend. Relative to their earnings increase inflation is not a limiting factor. Also SNAP benefits were just raised per person 32%. Starting October 1, 2021, SNAP (food stamp) benefits will permanently increase by an average of $36 per person, per month. The pre-pandemic benefit provided on average $121 per month for a single person; this will now be increased to $157 per month. Point never has the Walmart customer been so well heeled. And social security is to be raised by 6%."

golden cross... consumers looking for cheap stuff... Walmart is the move here
"I read no more layays at WMT . FINALLY BUY THE PRODUCT TAKE IT OUT OF THE STORE!!!! I worked for wmt over 22 years the company paid a fair wage compared to the out of businesses retailer exp sears,k-mart just to name a few. Now a story the poor put it on layaway then 60% never picked up their order Then the store had to put it on the floor after storing items aqs long as 2 months. Black Friday please don't censor me for say black Friday!!! A soon as the doors opened and employees and customers got off the floor from the stampede. Grab items and march to the layaway dept. THE WHOLE IDEA OF BLACK FRIDAY WAS SPECIALS FOR ONE DAY NOT TO PUT ON LAYAWAY."
The last person I know of in our neighborhood who still shopped at Walmart told me yesterday that she will no longer shop there. She was very upset because they took out all the price checkers and she said they have charged more at the register too many times to trust them especially on non-food items and she said she isn't going to play store cop and try and remember all the prices and then have to deal with them when she is overcharged. Walmart is digging their own grave. Very poor management.
"Well, a slight green showing today, but in this Democrat controlled country, who knows how long green will show. The give away group is bankrupting the country. If you feed wild animals, they lose the ability to feed themselves eventually. I only feed the birds in the very cold months when getting food is harder for the fear of making them too dependent on me. Our country should share that method of giving out money for rent, food, etc. Schools say they are struggling to get food. I can remember the year I started teaching here, the school had a fire the month before school started and the cafeteria had burned along with many classrooms, so, they got 6 classrooms finished and EVERYONE in those classrooms brought a sack lunch. EVERYONE. That was a time in history when if you had children, you were responsible to feed them!!!"
"If you stay in the market during sell offs like this, you will be much better than those people who try and time the market. You can pick up some stocks cheap."
Why is there no food and items in the wal marts. The whole store looks like a riot hit it. I go 3 blocks down the road to the local supermarket and they have all kinds of stuff and at better prices. Something is definitely wrong with this picture. My guess is they cant find any workers to put stuff on shelves...What is your guess
It is always nice to end Friday on green.
Does it not only make simple financial sense to get the two main entitlement programs we already have of social security and medicare that are both teetering on insolvency in the next couple of years financially secure first ? Before you go ahead and create new massive entitlement programs like the socialists want to do.Or didn't the borrow and spend socialists ever bother to think of doing something fiscally responsible like that first?
NO ONE NOTICED WMT STOPPED LAYAWAYS??? DEMOCRAT PRIDE WILL BE UPSET.Layaway was great when there were poor people. Now there is enough welfare for everyone

The number of workers who cited the pandemic as the reason they didn’t look for jobs rose last month for the first time since January, reaching 1.6 million.BTW fritz, remember over a year ago when I TOLD you who would suffer the most from shutting down the economy?
