"I mean AT&T could hit the teens. If the new entity is priced at $ 7, that means AT&T's price will be reduced by $ 7. And with dividend investors slowly getting out, I don't see a catalyst for this to go much higher, but do see one for it to go lower. I'm ALL-IN if we hit 22 or less the day it trades as a stand-alone entity. If they lower the dividend by 45% to $ 1.14, that's a 5.2% Yield."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
We're still like a year away from the merger. Don't know if I can hang on that long. The small losses every day are beginning to add up. A very good earnings report did nothing for this stock.
T shareholders will own new company with 71% of shares if deal goes through middle of next year before we know. They are selling 29% stake in Warner and getting paid to own new company. Only T and dis shareholders will get shares so there will be immediate demand for your shares. Shareholders will make nice gain right away. Plus you get 7.6% dividend rate next 3 quarters. T will beat estimates again this Q and when they et debt to 2.5x will restart share buyback. Don't believe stuff you hear check it out for yourself. Misinformation is hard at work. All kinds of contracts flowing into T. Sold off anima 1.17 billion this Q.
looking at the 6 month chart the run up to chitly's spin off - t was trading up - since then continued down almost every day - not even an attempt of a recoverymarket believes different than ceo - in the end only shareholders suffer chitly will get millions in bonuses
Longs talk about a 7 percent (plus) yield because that is what the yield is and will be for at least the next 3 quarters. That’s not nothing.
"T has no money to even buy back some of its own shares to pump the stock up.....its flat broke.....All the small fries on this site are complaining but why do you all remain? The spin off will emasculate the once great dividend in addition to saddling the so called streaming wonder company, already down from a high of 71 last year to its pitiful number now, with the tens of billions of T debt from the horrible purchase of Time Warner......The major pension funds are slowly selling off in order not to force T stock down to its 20 level at the present time.......As the stock drops, the dividend also drops simply because 7% on 25 is less than 7% on 28......Stankey knows this will help him until the spinoff occurs......Does anyone think the future 3.8 % dividend will be special when there are dozens of decent companies making money already paying similar divies......Sadly, the market of today has no real value for dividends anymore, being a very different market than its was 20 years ago........instead of dividends, these companies pay their bigshots hundreds of millions each year and skip the shareholders, the small people who might need that money.....We've destroyed the middle class in this country and sadly, the market that T was once part of and failed to realize was their reason for existing, has now been mortgaged off to the banks, etc......T has died as far as i am concerned......it didn't understand its reason to be up in the market of today.......i got out as soon as i read the future tea leaves from stankey and lucked out by putting my money into companies which had a future and were going up, sadly without dividends......i did well that way......T was almost unique in its way, being a strong company, providing its shareholders with a great dividend, but lost its way and its all over.........finis !! There is no future except in the minds of those who hope that the spin off will work......my guess is Stankey will be gone before this occurs or shortly afterwards...."
All fake news and hype. Can someone comment as to what is the actual reason for the drop? 1 year RSI at 28 and currently oversold. Why is this dropping?
Why is John Stankey not making a very large purchase of T shares personally at this price? That says it all.
It is about time we had a president that cares about wall street not main street! Inflation is out of control and but who cares as long wall street goes up!
based on todays pricing spinning of warner/ discovery will have value of 7 with no dividendT will be 20 with ~ 3.5% dividend - this does not figure in dividend payments share price discounts $ 1.52 or any further price erosion - looking closer to 16 - 18 for T (3.5% ) dividend and 5-6 for discovery - 22-24 at best!Having a hard time understanding the ceo cfo saying this is a win win because warner is undervalued - then why the F are they selling if for 1/3 of what they paid for it 3 years earlier!corporate spin = govt spin - deal is going to be a huge loss for share holders and a huge bonus for management
"Here's Why AT&T Should Belong In a Long-Term PortfolioInvestors are struggling to keep up with the changes in the company’s business, and the share price reflects their question marks.T stock is down about 5% in 2021. By comparison, the S&P index is up over 19% so far in the year.After trying to integrate media into its business model over the years, AT&T finally turned the tables by spinning off WarnerMedia in a deal with Discovery. The merger will finalize in 2022 and trade under the new ticker symbol WBD.AT&T shareholders have taken a major beating ever since the Time Warner acquisition. It was a bold move to buy Time Warner in 2018 for $85.4 billion. Now, since the most recent spinoff announcement in May, analysts have been debating how much AT&T stock may be worth after the deal is finalized next spring.The spinoff is poised to make AT&T a pure-play telecommunications company once again. Management can now expand the 5G network while enhancing its fiber footprint in the industry. I believe this is good news for potential investors, especially given its current stock price.Here’s why.AT&T released robust second-quarter results in late July. It generated $44 billion in revenues, up 7.6% from a year ago. Adjusted EPS came at 89 cents, an increase of 7.2%. Free cash flow stood at $7 billion. The company beat analyst wireless subscriber estimates by a wide margin. It registered a 1.16 million increase in its wireless customers. This figure was almost four times the consensus estimates and double the gains reported by Verizon during the same period. The company ended the quarter with 87.5 million subscribers, representing a 22% year-over-year increase.In its media business, Warner Media also saw robust growth in revenues and subscribers. Advertising revenue went up by 49% and now has 67 million subscribers worldwide, with a forecast of 70 million to 73 million by year’s end.While the communications segment is generally a slow-growth business, AT&T sees its 5G wireless offering as its primary growth engine going forward. The company is deploying $60 billion in 5G wireless and focusing on what management feels it does best.A critical factor in soaring wireless additions has been lower subscriber churn driven by AT&T’s heavy promotions. While device promotions are generally limited to new customers, AT&T offers existing customers various deals as well. However, this approach has led to shrinking wireless margins for AT&T. In the long run, it may not be a sustainable strategy.AT&T stock trades only at 8.9x forward earnings, compared to almost 57x for T-Mobile. Therefore, from a valuation standpoint, T shares deserve to be on your radar, too.Second-quarter earnings performance supports the bullish argument for T stock. The company is making significant progress in expanding its 5G network while also retaining 71% ownership of a valuable media asset.AT&T will soon lose its dividend aristocrat status, as it will be cutting its dividend once the spinoff deal closes in mid-2022. The stock currently generates a 7.5% yield, one of the highest dividend yields in the S&P 500. Thus, a reduction in yield would not be as dramatic as it sounds. Income investors should also consider the potential for capital gains.The spinoff decision will likely prove be a bullish move for AT&T. Given the significant upside potential of its 5G wireless business, the recent pullback in T stock may offer a unique buying opportunity for long-term investors."
"The amount of large institutional outflows of T is staggering, they obviously don't see any short term value and know their capital is best served in other industries ie financials, tech etc."
"How is the CEO able to keep his job ??? His performance has been terrible and the company has become a modern day Titanic only instead of going down all at once , this company is just slowly sinking. If the BOD had any integrity at all they would have fired the CEO by now."
Can anyone give me their best guesstimate as to how many shares an At and T shareholder can expect/hope to receive on the new company?
Read an interesting post about T this week . A retired SBC executive mentioned in 2008 that by 2020 T would have repurchased 30 % of outstanding shares and be debt free . That didn’t happen
"Verizon is way off its highs also in the past six months, what do they have in common with a t and t : Huge Debt.... not hard to understand."
"I guess my posts are disappearing. Someone does not like that I posted that STANKEY and BOD are the only ones making millions of dollars In salary, bonuses and options - it’s like their own personal ATM. the rest of us big individual investors have massive losses in AT&T. For the terrible management of this company, this team takes in millions for themselves? Why is that? Something is wrong!!"
"Valuation: Buy RatedDespite a more simplified set of connectivity assets, lower leverage (UBSe 2.8x at YE22;2.5x at YE23), a better EBITDA trajectory and visibility on $20B of FCF in '23, impliedvaluation sits at just 5.8x PF '23E EBITDA and 7.3x FCF vs. VZ at 7.3x/11.6x. While adiscount is warranted (higher wireline mix), we expect the gap to narrow. PT is based ona SOTP: $28/sh for new AT&T (7x 22-23E EBITDA) and $7/sh for new DISCAUBS Target Price for T is $35."
"Homegamers. Don't Give Up ! (TRUE Story)......Several years ago 2019 I think it was ,I had a position in ATTworth Approx 1.6 Million.. The stock just languished, I collected Great Dividends.. All of a sudden, in a VERY short time frame, maybe 3 or 4 days, it gained 3 or 4 dollars a share. I SOLD and made about $140,000 on thetrade...At that time, my BEST trade ever ! Now my 2nd best, I hit a BIG NCLH last year on a 2 day trade for about $160K. ATT Normally doesn't have these kind of runs, but look at past charts, they do happen. Currently, I AM ALL IN on an ATT Position with a little over 103,000 shares. Just a place to park some cash, in a NORMALLY Defensive stock, with a GREAT yield.. My avg price is $28.59/share/ However, I picked up a 42K Dividend check earlier this month on the # of shares I had at the X date at that time, so my current Paper Loss, counting my Divvy is about $108,000. Which really is Nothing on an almost 3 Million Dollar position....HANG IN THERE ! I think this will RALLY. In the meantime, just take the Dividend. It will either GO UP Before or after the spinoff....In the meantime,l just wait it out. IF I'm LUCKY Enough again to be in one of those $3-$4share POPS, I'd probably go ahead and Sell it, and pay the tax like I did before...."
