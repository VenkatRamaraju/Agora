"I did some worst case scenarios. Let's say T hits $20 with a market cap of $142B. The total return from there would be $1 in cash dividend before next June and a Warner special dividend of $5 per share in June. The T stock in June would then open at $15 because of the Warner Distribution (it subracts). You would have received $6 in return at that time. Warner at $5 per share of T + Discovery equity has a $43B market cap. Wow! Lol. That is really cheap and would certainly increase and reward you with some nice gains over time for the Warner shares you own. Now T at $15 after the spin-off with the new lower T dividend would be close to 7.3%, An incredibly high number and actually 1.8% more than any viable non-BK company in the market except Altria. Altria has massive debt and even worse - doesn't make enough money to even cover the dividend. Exxon or a few utilities like PPL are the only closest yields and they are currently 5.6%. There is no way that yield chasing funds will sit back and buy junk bonds for 6% when T stock yields 7.3% and is ultra safe because of the lower debt and really high free cash flow. The T dividend payout ratio will be 40% of cash flow. That is very very safe.So now I know one thing - T can't reach $20 because the numbers are off the chart for being a very very very cheap stock. I do this same analysis anytime I have a stock move down on me. I want to know my worst case. I would say with #$%$ $22 if the market falls apart (but other many stocks will lose 30% or more), $24 if the market has a bad dip, and $25 if the overall market stays here. The numbers are just too attractive for yield chasers at anything under these numbers. There are a lot of high yield funds that understand what I am writing. Do you buy a junk bond yielding 5 or 6% or buy T with a future yield at ~6% with a Warner stock attached that that seems very undervalued when you get it. At $30 maybe it was time to sell, but now at $25, you hold and wait for the final cards to be dealt. (At $25, the future T yield after the spin-off is 6%. I can't find anything yielding that right now that doesn't require me to take a lot of risk.)"
"From Deutche BankPost-3Q21 Thoughts & Model Update; Last Close USD25.76, Buy.Bryan Kraft: We are maintaining our Buy rating and $37 PT following the company's 3Q21 results. Our longer term revenue, EBITDA and FCF estimates are increasing by around 1-2% following our incrementally more favorable view on fundamentals in AT&T's core communications businesses (see figure 2). We believe that AT&T's stock price offers attractive upside as the company completes the pending spin/merge of Warner Media in 2022, resets the dividend, reduces leverage, continues to execute on its wireless revenue growth turnaround and cost transformation, and invests in FTTH broadband growth. Our SOTP based $37 PT implies nearly 44% upside to the current stock price."
"Over 1,100,000 shares have already been traded after-hours, which is about 5 times the normal volume. Someone knows something and is clearly getting positioned. Don't sell your shares, there's definitely more upside."
"Not only is this company poorly managed ...It requires all employees to be indoctrinated with Critical Rac theory....I WILL BE VOTING NO ON ALL PROXY MATTERS REGARDING MANAGEMENT, Can this company do anything Right?"
"T reminds me when I kept adding microsoft stock in 40s and 50s and 60s... when the analysts kept writing the company off as old not innovative and to avoid ... now msft stock at 300+ saying the best of the tech companies outthere and buy it at this level, similarly i keep accumulating T and will check back in 2 years to see whether my opinion is correct or not...cheers"
"Obviously this has not been my best bet. I'm not down much, and will just hold, ignoring all the self appointed experts on the board, and CNBC. No such thing as ""easy money,"" and as Iv'e said before, theMM and funds are experts at creating fear- They have all the resources- money and time, to wait things out. So they bang out the sheep, force people to hit the sell button and take losses, and then, miraculously, in a few days, months, etc they are rewarded. A tremendous percentage of the market is run by the top 1%, followed by another large % by the top 3%....They can afford to wait- and they get richer by playing the same fiddle that works. As Warren Buffet always says- ""Fear is a more powerful motivator that greed.""Long....Holding.... D"
T should announce what the dividend will be post split i.e. $1 per share annually. That would help to put a floor under the share price. The % of cashflow bs is too wishy washy to create a floor.
T is like a fish out of water - flaps around and slowly dies - exactly where share price is headed
"There's literally thousands of stocks out there that have done well, and are doing well.Why in the love of God would anybody be looking to buy T ?Must be that juicy dividend that going to be slashed. Even if it wasn't, it doesn't matter, because the share price depreciation wipes that out in no time. Since the announcement in May, shares have dropped 7$..... over 3 years of the current dividend amount wiped out. Welcome to frontier communications part II"
"Remember what happened to GE, due to bad management and failed acquisition and huge debt? From $30 to $5 before reverse split."
"According to the article I read picked by yahoo, T is the one of the stock identified for tax loss harvesting"
"I bought a few shares of T after the WM spinoff announcement. I think the BOD will be well advised to announce an actual date for the dividend cut before more details regarding the WM - DISCA is made public. If they believe that the new company will be successful, why not cut the dividend ASAP and start buying back shares of T with the money they save. This will send a positive signal to shareholders that they not only have faith in the future of T, but also the new company."
"You’ve got a CEO who is more interested in training employees in CRT and white guilt than creating shareholder value - sell the stock. Not a value proposition. PS , read Milton Friedman on why capitalism is pure racial equality and does not discriminate."
I believe asset amortization and asset receivables are what really worry investors about att. Att promotional discounts recorded as equipment revenue but a lot of that revenue they did not receive cash. The discounted equipment recorded on income statement as revenue and on balance sheet statement as asset receivables. These asset receivables are amortized for duration of the service contract. Therefore mobility ebitda is overstated.
It is better to buy great stock at bottom than the top. Entire communication sector is down. I believe sector rotation is in play. Communication sector due for rebound from bottom.
"I’ve read a lot of these comments about AT&T and what it’s stock may or may not do. This is what I know for sure: The last CEO, Randall Stephenson left the company and took a $64 million dollar retirement package with him. AT&T will never care about the average share holder and this company will never recover from this larceny. If the present CEO has a chance to do the same thing he will!"
"AT&T's 'Racial Re-Education Program' Asserts ""White People, You Are the Problem""Tyler Durden's PhotoBY TYLER DURDENSATURDAY, OCT 30, 2021 - 11:30 AMAuthored by Paul Joseph Watson via Summit News,Details of AT&T Corporation’s ‘racial re-education program’ have leaked in which the company asserts “American racism is a uniquely white trait” and announces, “white people, you’re the problem.”The documents were obtained by investigator and Critical Race Theory exposer-in-chief Christopher Rufo.“CEO John Stankey launched the program last year and, subsequently, has told employees that private corporations such as AT&T have an “obligation to engage on this issue of racial injustice” and push for “systemic reforms in police departments across the country,” writes Rufo.[ZH: Critical race theory is a Marxist-based philosophy that suggests society is a class struggle between oppressors and the oppressed, labeling white people as the oppressors and all other races as the oppressed.]Predictably, the re-education program was launched in response to the police killing of career criminal, drug addict and arrest-resistor George Floyd.“According to a senior employee, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, managers at AT&T are now assessed annually on diversity issues, with mandatory participation in programs such as discussion groups, book clubs, mentorship programs, and race reeducation exercises.”White employees are mandated to confess their “systemic racism” and enjoyment of “white privilege” or face penalties (they’re so “privileged,” they get to enjoy one of America’s biggest corporations openly discriminating against them for their skin color).White staffers are also asked to sign a loyalty pledge indicating their submission to the brainwashing while also vowing to ‘challenge others’ if they hear ‘hateful language’."
This might explain the poor performance since the earnings report. Annualized Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio. Four Quarters ending 9-30-2020 = 2.66 Four Quarters ending 9-30- 2021 = 3.17. That is going the wrong way! I believe the reason is the $ billions that ATT spent at the 5G auctions but investors do not like to see that ratio going up. Verizons A.N.D.to EBITDA is 2.7. If telecom has to keep spending $ billions at the 5G auctions telecom might not be a good investment. We are still holding ATT but a I am looking for some light at the end of this tunnel. You can find this information at ATT investor Relations. Good luck to all longs!
"I'm sure glad I didn't listen to 90% of the people talking yesterday. I picked up more shares at $25.07 yesterday. I will gladly buy more if it drops again. T long and strong. I love buying T at a undervalued price, even more so for long holding. Also cant beat there is a buy one get one stock deal till the spin off deal. Loading up on T till the deal next year to get as much as i can of the spin off company. Who wouldn't want 71% of what will be AT LEAST the 3rd largest streaming platform day one of launch? All while getting T stock on top of that for low $25's. Yeah sign me up. I will pull the truck around"
"That's all T knows how to do is alienate people. They alienate their customers, they alienate their workers, and now alienate their investors. T's management needs to go!"
