"If you look at the trend line for the past 10 minutes, we are clearly in a bullish trend"
All the selling dried up... stay tuned!
Oh No... Look Ma ATT down 7c today. Will we have steak tonight?
"At $27.91 this stock is now $4.31 or 13.4% down since the WM spin-off announcement in May. The stock was gaining momentum at that time, but Stankey had this great spin-off idea that put us where we are today. After more than one year as CEO he is ~8% below the closing stock price the day before he took office."
You have 3 quarters of dividends before anything happens if it even does. Dis shareholders and regulatory commission have to both approve spin off. It is a great deal for T shareholders going to make out big.They will delete my post dont want you to know truth
"T has to go a long way to be bullish. It’s still below where it was a month ago, 6 months ago, etc."
We're still like a year away from the merger. Don't know if I can hang on that long. The small losses every day are beginning to add up. A very good earnings report did nothing for this stock.
"How is the CEO able to keep his job ??? His performance has been terrible and the company has become a modern day Titanic only instead of going down all at once , this company is just slowly sinking. If the BOD had any integrity at all they would have fired the CEO by now."
based on todays pricing spinning of warner/ discovery will have value of 7 with no dividendT will be 20 with ~ 3.5% dividend - this does not figure in dividend payments share price discounts $ 1.52 or any further price erosion - looking closer to 16 - 18 for T (3.5% ) dividend and 5-6 for discovery - 22-24 at best!Having a hard time understanding the ceo cfo saying this is a win win because warner is undervalued - then why the F are they selling if for 1/3 of what they paid for it 3 years earlier!corporate spin = govt spin - deal is going to be a huge loss for share holders and a huge bonus for management
"Thinking of making a longterm investment in T, is the dividend safe?"
"Do we see a stock mkt. crash coming, dont know if T will go much lower, already at a 6 month low ?"
this stock should be near high not at near low. Pays great dividend. under valued big time.
Morning T ~ lots and nothing going on with the markets today. Still feeling a slight correction is coming . Inflation is still a major concern in my opinion
They continue to delete my posts just trying to let a few know before they do T worth a lot more than where it is now get it on the cheap before they do
Just listened to a British Leader being interviewed and he made it clear that the special relationship with the U.S. since 1917 has now been broken by the President. If this is an example of the damage with our allies we have serious trouble. I blame the media more than ever and their corporate owners.
Sell now and then buy back at $ 15 per share
S&P 500 is a better investment that ATT. Say this Mantra 10 times daily.
"FYI The news outlet MacRumors reported Sunday that Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with TF International Securities known for tapping contacts in the Asian supply chain for insights about Apple products, believes that the iPhone 13 will use a Qualcomm chip that supports low-earth-orbit satellite communications.“If Apple/ Qualcomm /Iridium figure it out, an iPhone user in theory could make calls without using his or her cellular carrier,”"
What is going on???
Everyone of Daryl's posts says the exact same thing! Get on your point then off of it
I think it's time to shake up management! Guys wake up and see the stock board and vote out some of management in the next election.
We are seniors and welcome the 7% dividend paid last week. ATT in our opinion is safe stock. The dividend will be paid into next year until the deal is completed around June 2022.
"Surprise surprise T down again, whats new !"
What a dog. We should file a shareholder suit against the Board of Directors. They are responsible to the shareholders and they carry liability insurance for their mistakes. Maybe we should question the accuracy of their statements. What about their accountants. Remember ENRON?
"We as seniors feel safe holding this stock, plus this years dividends and the possibility of two pay out dividends next year."
"I just sold a $27.15 about an hour ago oh, I had AT&T in 2014 for a couple years when it went from 33 and I got out at 43 and change so thank God I made some money then because this time I took a $2, 750 loss . as I purchased at $32.20there's too many unknowns about this deal. not to mention I'm exhausted read all the articles and negative comments."
Longs talk about a 7 percent (plus) yield because that is what the yield is and will be for at least the next 3 quarters. That’s not nothing.
dont know about the rest of you T shareholders on this public forum message board but I have never MUTED so many posts.....ever
I think when T becomes 3 companies the shareholders will benefit greatly. All the details and dividend information not out yet but Discover & Warner Bros shares of stock will make up difference in T dividend smaller. 
"OK Homegamers...... I DID Buy More This AM to Average Down....Now 97,300 Shares at an Average of $28.65.Tomorrow I'll Have enough additional settled funds for 5,800 more shares..I'm ALL IN on #$%$ VERY MUCH OVERDUE For A RALLY !"
"Someone should give Randall Stephenson a ""prize"" for successfully disappearing the most market cap of a company. Think about it, he bought DirecTV and Warner Bros for about 140 Billion, and now the entire AT&T is worth only 56B more of what he paid for these two companies?? Just so that we feel more miserable, does anyone remember the terms of his exit package?"
This stock is definitely a laggard. Over the years the overall market creeps higher while T trades nowhere. Had this for years collecting the divi and let it accumulate more shares but would be better off today if I reinvested it in a S&P 500 ETF.
"Cash cow, growing, meets or beats estimates and pays a super high yield. Don't get the hate with this stock."
market continues to climb dow up 273 nasdaq up 193 T barely green! doesnt trade with the market up but sure falls as the market corrects! - sign of a poor performing stock not to mention a worthless CEO and BOD - But what else is new!
"Even if the dividend gets reduced to 32 cents, at the current share price that would be close to/in line with what VZ is paying as dividend but T stock price would have considerable upside than VZ from its share price of 28 once it lightens up debt and focuses on its core business, it will benefit from 5G cycle."
"One thing is for sure.. Even if everything is shutdown, The stock market will go up."
T should put itself up for sale after TW spin off. Tmobile or VZ could buy it.
"For those who are interested, the VWAP and % of total shares in circulation for the past 5 days, 10 days, 20 days, 50 days, 79 days, 100 days, 173 days are posted below - 5 days - $27.37 - 2.02%10 days - $27.63 - 3.81%20 days - $27.82 - 7.44%50 days - $28.25 - 21.66%79 days - $29.08 - 42.85% [my average, too]100 days - $29.47 - 55.09%173 days - $29.38 - 100% [it is interesting to note that it is just 100% of shares only not a complete reshuffle].Considering institutions have the largest stake in this, I believe that the price should go above $31.74 within the next 173 days, with a certainty of 95%!"
with the market up over 250 and the nasdaq up 174 #$%$ stock T will turn RED TODAY!
Has Yahoo Finance been hacked? Is the NYSE broken this week? There must be something wrong. Maybe it's my browser cache. Any ideas?
"OK... I'm out. Oh as far as this Daryl guy, 17 posts in less than 23 hours. A bit excessive?!?"
T is Basically buying a new company and new company is paying T billions to do it. with 71% of stock they have control and get discovery for free. Drop a bunch of debt increase cash flow both companies. would not surprise me if discovery shareholders reject it. Dont think regulatory commission will. T will own them and T shareholders will control new company.You will make a killing if deal goes through. still 9 months away at least. lot of people going to wish they had not sold. T is going to start buying back shares when they get to 2.5X.
Hands up if you thought you'd ever see $27.50 again when the stock was $32 right before they announced the deal.
DIS is going to bring back dividend very soon and new company will have dividend and T shareholders will own 71% only T and DIS shareholders will get stock in new company. Both T and new company will have increase cash flow. T will reduce debt. start buybacks at 2.5x and you will make a bunch if deal goes through.T basically selling only 29% of warner and getting dis for free. dont believe posts here check it out.
what is the RSI? this has to be oversold short term.
only way you et shares in new company is if you are a T shareholder or discovery share holder and until they are issued to you no one else can buy them. last time I got shares like this they went up real fast everybody made plenty. Dont believe any posts check into it for yourself.
"WOW, T is doing great. The DOW is up $234 points and T is up a whooping .09.Well on it's way to $40!!! It should get there in about 50 years."
"In your opinion, who is the most guilty person for T's current situation, Randall Stephenson? Under his ""leadership"", T lost billion and more billions after the DTV deal, and probably also with the TW deal. You wonder where T would be now if he hadn't done those deals. Wondering how much Stephenson made for all his years as the CEO of AT&T, plus his retirement package..."
Can anyone provide a compelling rational reason why T is sitting at $27.13 if it's worth what you think it is?
"Another $3k income, perfect. Selling the calls at $29 or above is the winner."
If I buy tomorrow will I still get the divvy.
"Homegamers....No More Posts Today, Unless ""T"" Makes A Nice Run In The Last Hour....ALWAYS Remember Though.....Who's Your ATT Daddy !"
Today might be the day I say goodbye to T. Total let down the past 5 years. I should have invested in FANG or just put it all in my S&P 500 index fund. #DeadMoney
This board is pointing to a strong buy. When negativity gets this high we are about to turn.
AT & T reminds me a lot like Washington Mutual.........did not end well
General Motors plans to sell vehicles with AT&T's 5G cellular connectivity starting in 2023
Order in at 25. ONE THOUSAND LONG!
Why is John Stankey not making a very large purchase of T shares personally at this price? That says it all.
any guesses on the future dividend?
T is the new GE. Very similar fundamentals.
T should be near 52 week high here. Same with Verizon. They both pay great dividend. Tech stocks so over priced I see massive sell off in Nasdaq here. I see thousands in Nasdaq sell off.
The only reasons I can see to hold onto this stock currently is for the 7% dividend or if one bought into it in 2000/2001 and would take a heavy hit. Currently the price is where it was 11 years ago.
There are $15M open interest calls at $30 strike due on Jan 22 2022. Who do you think sold those calls? Big mutual fund!!! This stonk will not pass $29 by EOY. Safe to sell naked calls at $30-$31 LEAP calls for free money.
"I guess my posts are disappearing. Someone does not like that I posted that STANKEY and BOD are the only ones making millions of dollars In salary, bonuses and options - it’s like their own personal ATM. the rest of us big individual investors have massive losses in AT&T. For the terrible management of this company, this team takes in millions for themselves? Why is that? Something is wrong!!"
GE did a reverse split Aug. 2 to lower the number of outstanding shares. GE is up about 5% in 1 month. I wonder if it is partly because they reduced the number of outstanding shares.
T Lower high trades through out the day = lower lows trading throught the is painful for T shareholders with a steep decline from 3:30 on - 27.30 or lower at the close - 26s in the coming days!Absolutely nothing holding T above 27Spin off going from bad to aweful for shareholders !
"Once we go to Quantum Starlink, AT&T's technology is obsolete as 5G is no longer used....that will be in the very near future..."
"Why pay more than you have to? Appears $27.50 is the max today, unless something comes out in the news."
"Moe, Larry and Curly now running T"
TURD T had the morning rally hit 27.50 now a return to new daily lows!The value of the spin off will continue to be less than the value of T the day before spin off!Down pressure continues as market views dividend cut will further erode T share price
"I own zero stock of T, and I’m selling naked calls for $29+ strike expiring EOY. Every rise I will sell, and every dip I will buy to close cover. Then repeat, each time I earn around $3k. Good luck bag holders."
most reliable guess's see deal going thru much sooner than expected...before '22...govmt deflecting...they are in deep ca ca
And the slow descent of T continues. Next stop $26's.
"Time for changes at the top. I would start with exiting the CFO and begin a search for new CEO. The CFO first... who has not explained this deal effectively to the markets nor to shareholders, nor has formulated the right long-term strategy. In his last update, the CFO mentioned that the deal was in part because the markets weren't valuing HBO Max properly. One could argue that the markets aren't valuing the entire company properly, but it isn't a reason to break up the company and do something that the market hasn't liked nor was prepared for. In any event, this is the CFO job to formulate strategy and work with and explain value to the street. He has failed in his primary role and should go, or be shown the door. Strategy and Communication!"
Any one else curious of the separation as being a way to protect profitable assets before impending BK? T just doesn't smell right. Left T like 20 years ago knowing I would never use them again. This dog needs to be gently laid to rest. Discovery is awesome though. Best thing for them in an attempt to survive the connection.
"Based on bollinger bands and rsi, this stock might touch ~$27.5 in a couple of weeks. I will then try to get rid of it with less loss. Will it be touching $28 anytime soon so I can get out with break even? To me it seems it will go below $26 in 30 to 60 days."
"Been writing the 28 options every week. If I have it, write the calls. Called away I write the puts. Safe, and the annual return is terrific. Not positive about the long term, but this strategy been making me money consistently."
"What Cramer did today was exactly what shorts do. He read a blip from Argus which stated the math didn't work for AT&T to pay out dividends in the 95% percentile as management has stated. Ok, maybe the dividend will be in the 90% percentile. He made it sound AT&T wouldn't be able to payout the resized dividend of 40% to 43% on anticipated free cash flow of $20 billion plus which isn't true."
Fundamentally a good trade but a brutal technical trade. T's existing shareholder base is risk averse and income oriented. This downturn feeds on itself. Dividend cut coming and declining share price equals panic selling. At what price will capitulation kick in?
T-mobile about to pass AT&T in market cap. That pretty much sums up what investors think about T and it's management.
The stock is overdue for a 10% pop on those blockbuster results they recently posted with raised guidance.
Will the CEO address the stock price?!? Poor leadership.
"HOMEGAMERS ......I Need a Little Timmmmmmmmberrrrr Now So I Can BUY BackThe 24K Shares I Sold, At A Lower Price... I previously bought some @27.85, sold at 28.22. Now mylast 2 buys in the low 27.30's, sold today @27.47.. Just slowly averaging down by trading.."
"""ViacomCBS waiting for other suitors"", according to today's NY Post. A nice advantage for the new Warner Bros. Discovery company.""Shari Redstone is hitting pause on any potential partnership talks between her media company ViacomCBS and NBC owner Comcast until next year. This includes any talks of a merger or a joint domestic venture where Comcast and ViacomCBS could combine their respective streaming services, Peacock and Paramount Plus."" Interesting too is that the article goes on to say that ""One potential buyer of CBS is the media entity that will emerge next year from AT&T’s planned sale of its WarnerMedia unit."""
THE PUMPERS OF T ON THIS BOARD DO I DISSERVICE TO THE NOVICE INVESTOR! MANAGEMENT PLAN AND SIMPLE LIED TO INVESTORS ABOUT THE DIVIDEND BEING SAFE. IF YOU CAN'T TRUST MANAGEMENT WHY INVEST IN THAT COMPANY?
In the red by the EOD
MO increasing dividend will be 7+ % yield at current share price.
I have always made money trading T…. Now I’m not touching it. It’s headed to low 20’s.
"Here's a reasonable question. If the deal is so good, why did T drop two bucks the day it was announced and why is it now sitting .65 from it's 52 week low? Down over five bucks since the deal was announced in May. Do you think you're smarter than the market? Hmmmm, I don't think so."
"Committed to hold through the spinoff and beyond. But geesh, what a dog this has become."
Someone bought/sold 737 shares at $27.468 at 09:17:06. Some sort of a signal/error?
"At $27.25 T stock is now 15.5% down, since the day Stankey announced his great idea to spin-off WM and merge it with DISCA. I can only say, “res ipsa loquitur”, the facts speak by themselves."
All fake news and hype. Can someone comment as to what is the actual reason for the drop? 1 year RSI at 28 and currently oversold. Why is this dropping?
"Big mutual funds are doing the same way, selling covered calls. There is already $15M calls at $30 strike expiration by EOY. They will not let this stonk above $29. They have zillions of shares."
T is throwing a 7.7 div. Think about that. A company this large cannot sustain that.The new spin off is a gadget to unload debt and it is doomed to sink like a stone. T in trouble. Plenty of sound investments out there with less risk.
Say bye bye to another div payment
As the market speeds back to the all time high T drips to a multi year low. chitforbrains ceo chitly is paid millions per year to give shareholders a negative share price and a 50% dividend cut. WOW truly any person that did nothing - just sitting in the ceo's chair - status quo - would have stock holder appreciation. This was a blue chip stock that never increased shareholder value - it just paid a good dividend nothing more than that. If T was not so profitable the ceo's and bod would of bankrupted T years ago.
"Sell into strength if U R looking to exit. Oct 8 is x-div, there will be a run up preceding that date. Have your bags packed."
"Sold another 1k calls, at $30 strike. This stonk will never pass $29 by EOY. Free money prints"
"by far, the worst stock in my portfolio."
Congratulations to CNN. The first network with more employees than viewers.
Look at this strong AF close from my two workhorses. VZ and T. Happy my money is parked here right now.
"Well, I feel gutted! I bought xxxx shares of T about 2 years ago. Down 20% with dividends. Ouch! Everyone talking here about future investors- that’s what they said to me 2 years ago. The only ones making money are the AT&T crooks that run the company. It’s like Stankes personal ATM. He’s making millions. Thieves and crooks. I’m just stuck now and I hope this badly run company doesn’t go down any further."
T $28 in 1995. It's like going in a time machine back 27 years and buy T. Great stock if you live to 150.
T's chart looks like a double black diamond ski slope
"Reading between the lines, will the Newco transaction close earlier than mid year 2022? The second thought it how much lead time will there be before and in front of the spin date, such as with ex div announcements? A bagholder could wish it is a drop dead announcement, such as shareholders as of yesterday get the goods and the remainder wait for the spin date to purchase Newco such as with an IPO? From the article --- At another recent conference, Desroches discussed the mid-2022 target time for the closing of the deal to create what will be known as Warner Bros. Discovery, saying: “We are hopeful that we are conservative in our outlook in terms of the time that it is going to take to get it approved, but we don’t know.” And Desroches emphasized at the time: “We are not concerned at all that this could be challenged from a regulatory standpoint.” https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/att-warnermedia-deal-stock-market-credit-hbo-max-1234992549/."

Hey Stankey - your company's stock is trading at decades low...It's time to address it.
Wilson MUTED!
Att stock is almost as bad as their cell service. So much for trading a dividend for growth. Now we have neither.
"at&t blah blah price earning blah blahjust doin that so maybe my post lasts a little longerit sickens me to know that our best and brightest docs and nurses are working round the clock and putting themselves at substantial risk for the duhhhhhmbest of the duhhhmb, who btw are also in many cases passing the virus onto their kids. what party feels like the one that most aligns w/ these miscreants....that's rhetorical for you duhhhhmbies."
looking at the 6 month chart the run up to chitly's spin off - t was trading up - since then continued down almost every day - not even an attempt of a recoverymarket believes different than ceo - in the end only shareholders suffer chitly will get millions in bonuses
"Thought these conversations were to be about smart ideas for investments and stocks like T. Getting more politics and nonsense every day. GET BACK TO BASICS, please?"
Countdown to a 26 handle...go!
Citi reiterates buy recommendation with a 32 price target. Let's get there!
"Get it on sale before the deal closes, even with a 7% yield cut in half (if that is what happens), it will still have a strong dividend and it will allow the stock to be leaner and meaner, by that I mean price growth. TMUS pays no dividend and let’s users get hacked. VZ is the only real competitor, but their price is also stagnant."
This is one of the worst stocks of all time and I can’t wrap my mind around it it’s trading at the same level it was in 1995 and this company makes a ton of money? Honestly anybody have any explanation for this
"Things seem like they are good economically; why do I feel so bad? The National Debt is almost 30 trillion. The interest alone on this is over 400 billion a year. No one ever talks about that, but you feel it every time you go to the store. Higher prices..."
Told all you wackadoodle conservatives to buy buy buy in 26s. But then again I don’t even know why you are following stocks. Your leader said the nasdaq would be 5k by now. Lolololol. “Cut in half by summer”
"As the market surges T is headed the other way - CEO crushed any potential up ticks - not seeing 30 29 and only maybe mid 28s again -As we get closer to the dilution share price will continue to fall! Multi year lows are only $ 1.30 away - not much when this turd can fall 30+ cents a day!Again, CEO has build this turd on quick sand and share holders will suffer greatly!Market at the high of the day but T has already given up 1/2 of today's gains and headed lower!27.84 now 27.67 POOR EXCUSE OF A CEO - screw shareholders get paid millions, get bonuses on dilutions get another $ 100M on his golden parachute! Where is the justice? By the time warner is sold dividend is cut the T will be trading ~ 20 Discovery will be 6 and the dividend will be cut in 1/2 - so in the end shareholders will lose another 5-8% share value and their dividend will be cut in 1/2 - not a winning game plan"
WHAT DOES MANAGEMENT MAKE ON STOCK OPTIONS? COULD IT BE MILLIONS? AND SHAREHOLDERS LESS THAN ZIP LONGTERM. THOSE ARE JUST THE FACTS.
"I'm glad I dumped T two years ago. Right now in New Orleans, when people need it most, T customers are S.O.L. But Verizon is working just fine."
"any ATT shareholder whose has followed this message board knows that back in 2019 when elliot management ran the share price up to $38 it caused little tiny pee wee cheeto puff to lose all his T shares when he couldn't cover his losses by gambling on selling covered call options......he has never owned any ATT common since......and yet here he is trying to con you people with his ""risk-free"" options BS with multiple alias names even posting to himself.....for those of you who don't know this be warned he is a sick narcissistic FREAK that cannot be trusted......just MUTE the little CREEP and move on"
"So if Warner becomes a very strong streaming/entertainment juggernaut, what will the market value it at? Remember, the combined T, Warner and HBO were starting to really gain traction and the market was warming up to T being a viable value investment with some growth potential. just curious about the Warner evaluations and what it could grow to. Looking at Netflix, why couldn’t Warner be valued as a growth company and have a similar evaluation in due time?"
"“One of the things we realized (was that), even though we were succeeding in our launch of HBO Max, the market wasn’t giving us the appropriate credit for it,” Desroches said.“We felt a more efficient” set-up to give WarnerMedia “its own capital structure and stock” was better “so that investors who are interested in media would be able to invest directly into WarnerMedia,” the CFO explained. He said the Discovery deal would “unlock value for shareholders.”"
"Ok, I actually bought more 27.04."
Blackrock & Vanguard hold over 500 million shares each. If one of them decided to cut their holding then this is the type of selloff you get.
OK Homegamers.. Little Better Day Today...We Need 3 or 4 Green days In A Row To Build Some.....MOMENTUM !
With ongoing lower highs and lower lows the trend for T is down. If you don't believe me look at a Yahoo chart.
Morning T ~ hurricane ida no joke . Prayers for Louisiana
No need to worry after next dividend the stock drops in the 26 level then the selling to 25 starts....so the slow bleed to zero will continue...but then next year they cut the div and the stock goes to 15
There is a huge amount of older dividend collecting crowd that still want out of this stock
"Think about this and try to put it into perspective; TimeWarner share price was about 100 before T bought it and T share price roamed between 27 and 42 even when it was a pure play telecom company. Even with a profitable business like TimeWarner along with the already profitable telecom business, the share price of T still roamed between 27 and 42 as if it is still a pure play telecom business. It is as if there has been no value of TimeWarner business reflected in the T share price. That is really weird. Especially now when companies reporting loss every single quarter have way higher valuations than stable and profitable companies"
"In one week we've lost credibility and respect from everyone around the world. Who's going to believe us after this when we say, ""Fight for your freedom and we'll back you up""?"
You will see 25 before 30. The future is uncertain for T
T Doing Well Today.. That $27 Number Like I saidLast Week Is A LINE In The Sand !Will We DROP Below $27 ?
"The biggest problem with AT&T is the leadership team, the former CEO Randall Stephenson for 10 years that ran the company into the ground and his successor, STANKEY, that is following the same business model. And also the Board of Directors, also long tenured. One big mistake after another, non stop!! And yet, these folks are raking in millions of dollars and honest investors are being cleaned out of their life’s savings. How is this possible? So, until the leadership team and Board of Directors are voted out, I and many more investors have no confidence in my investment. This is my humble opinion. "
"Stankey’s announcement of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction back in May, which included a future 50% cut to T’s dividend, went against my strategy of maintaining a position in T. Since then, I’ve been looking for opportunities to rotate out of T and into other solid high dividend plays. Slowly started unwinding position in T in June and ramped it up over the last couple of weeks and rotated into existing positions in ABBV and VZ during recent dips and added a new position in XOM during the recent dip in oil. The fiascos in the DirectTV and WarnerMedia acquisitions didn’t inspire confidence, to say the least, that the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction as a so called growth play was going to make up the difference in the dividend cut to T especially when having to compete against others in the industry. I have about $18K to go to be completely out of T. Hopefully, that’ll be by the end of the year. Since 2014, my annual return on T has been -2.62, not including dividends. Including the 7% + dividend, total annual return has been close to 4.5%. I believe I can reasonably expect to do at least that or better in the positions that I’m rotating into. My lack of both confidence and trust in Stankey is so bad that I wouldn’t put it past him to cut the dividend before the completion of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction based on the one-eighty he did when he vowed not to cut the dividend."
"Morning Homegamers !Let's Start The Rally Today...I'm Long and Strong 103,000 Shares...."
Sold another 500 calls at $29 strike expiring EOY. Thanks for the free cash. This stonk will never pass $29 by EOY. Repeat…
"When the WM spin-off date is finally announced, T's price will drop: sell the news?"
"there is so many sellers in T i am surprised it actually is not in single digits,,"
"T awarded almost 1 billion dollar contract w/ US state dept , 10 minutes ago , integral part of US strategic objectives …… long baby !"
One series to save the streaming= Game of Thrones. The world’s favourite series will be here soon. Time to load up with T and benefit from the spin offs.
T shareholders will own new company with 71% of shares if deal goes through middle of next year before we know. They are selling 29% stake in Warner and getting paid to own new company. Only T and dis shareholders will get shares so there will be immediate demand for your shares. Shareholders will make nice gain right away. Plus you get 7.6% dividend rate next 3 quarters. T will beat estimates again this Q and when they et debt to 2.5x will restart share buyback. Don't believe stuff you hear check it out for yourself. Misinformation is hard at work. All kinds of contracts flowing into T. Sold off anima 1.17 billion this Q.
We're circling the drain at this point. This is all about the dividend cut IMO. I have never understood why they announced the div cut a YEAR in advance. Just let the deal go through then deal with the cut. Now we have a full year of uncertainty and repositioning going on which puts the stock in dog house for the foreseeable future. No one can inflict pain like T management.
"I mean AT&T could hit the teens. If the new entity is priced at $ 7, that means AT&T's price will be reduced by $ 7. And with dividend investors slowly getting out, I don't see a catalyst for this to go much higher, but do see one for it to go lower. I'm ALL-IN if we hit 22 or less the day it trades as a stand-alone entity. If they lower the dividend by 45% to $ 1.14, that's a 5.2% Yield."
"Did somebody take T off the Federal Reserve's buy list? T's management is just as woke and blue haired liberal as the rest of corporate America. Come on, man!"
"I bought in before the announced spin off, so I am down a few thousand, while I am hopeful the spin off when completed will be profitable, its hard to evaluate when you do not know how many shares we will get and their share price when distributed of the new company Warner Discovery. There is a part of me that believes when its all said and done, we will have a stronger phone company and a bigger stronger entertainment company. The dividend as good as it is pails to my loss to date, so I hope the value when its completed gets back my investment.....With the shares down I hope they can sweeten the pie to at least bring T holders back to even....."
"Say what you want about Stankey, but it's funny, T has done pretty much everything Elliott Mgmnt wanted them to do, and which Elliott said would have T at $65 / share in a few yrs (i believe that was the timetable). So now having done everything, T is actually far worse off than when Elliott became an activist. One has to conclude therefore, that Elliott totally got T wrong as well. Do we need divine intervention?"
"I agree with Argus from Buy to hold, but Iam not sure even too Hold !"

T survived 27...but tomorrow 26 is coming
Sold all my T and moved it to MO back in February. Just got a nice .16 raise today and it now pays $ 3.605/year. 54th raise in 51 years. 51 years of raises. #Gorilla
My buy back in price is 24.79. It may be sooner than I originally thought.
Analyst saying pullback is creating buying opportunity! Only 1 1/2 months untill next Ex-dividend date. I'm buying every week until then and seeing where we're at!
I've never seen people get so excited about a fractional % gain

"T mgmnt has been ABYSMAL at looking to the future, understanding how it would be shaped, and then effecting a strategy(ies ) that best prepared it to compete and win in that future. It's what execs are paid to do. Now, having said that, it really pis*es me off that our gov talks out of both sides of its mouth by saying how important it is to invest in our infrastructure, including having the best and most available comm networks, and then bleeds our best telecomms dry through spectrum auctions."

When is the BOD of AT&T going to be held accountable for the CNN fiasco. The advertising revenues are so much lower than they should be. CNN used to OWN the cable news sector and advertisers paid a premium to buy 30 & 60 second spots. Now CNN's ratings warrant an extreme discount. Whatever BOD member or members is responsible for this business sector needs to go and go fast
"I want to thank Stank for putting the stock in the dog house for a year or more. And to add insult to injury he announces a dividend cut a year in advance, to what end I have no idea."
"Do you think that the divestment of CrunchyRoll was a good idea? I get that they want to focus on the telecoms business, and they need cash to payoff their debts, but that is a huge asset, and maybe the most extensively coveted library of unique anime next to Funimation. Now Sony owns both are are looking to build up their content library for a streaming subscription service just like everyone else. The content wars are real. I think that they could've added that to the WD streaming play. Collecting 1.2B isn't making a real dent into their debt issues"
"This stock has been a waste of time ... sure you can stick around for the dividend but by then you’re giving up $1-3 per share. No direction, No creativity, No improvements. Just selling off debt ridden assets."
"The amount of large institutional outflows of T is staggering, they obviously don't see any short term value and know their capital is best served in other industries ie financials, tech etc."

You will end up with two stocks same value when added together and two dividends you wont lose you will see a nice gain.
"New here although I have T stock accumulated back during the Baby Bell era. My question is this: What do we, as shareholders, get when Discovery is spun off? I assume that to compensate us for the loss of value and the Dividend cut, we will get shares in the new company. Has there been any discussion as to what current shareholders will receive? (other than a diminished valuation due to the sell-off.)"
The stock performance is unacceptable. We need an Activist to save this company & reverse the dividend cut.
"Years ago Lucent Technologies elected Rinn McGinn as CEO. Company quickly dumped under his "" leadership"" and eventually went belly up. Great companies can be killed quickly under poor management."
"""Gone like the wind"" is the true meme for T. which will happen once they spin off TW."
The White Lotus is hands-down the best TV show this summer. HBO Max blows away the competition in engaging content. WarnerMedia will have a high valuation. T a steal below $30.
If deal happens you could see a 10 to 20% gain like overnight. Cash flow for both companies will improve and T gets discovery for free billions in cash and reduction of debt. They basically will own another company with 71% of stock. Most likely your dividend will increase as it is most probably that new company will also have nice dividend. Don't believe any posts research on your own. T shareholders will make a killing if deal goes through.
"I’m buying T under 28. We get monstrous divvy for a year. Huge divvy after that. And a solid relatively low risk telecom company after that, albeit with an enormous debt load. We also get a decent chunk of a possible growth company in the new Warner-DISC. I’ll keep buying this down to $25. Good luck all. Even the conservative snowflakes."

"Chris Cuomo is paid $6,000,000 per year for his one hour evening broadcast Monday to Friday on CNN. His rating is slightly above 1 million viewers. Obviously CNN could put anyone in that time slot and get the same low ratings.I would say he is grossly overpaid. An obvious case of diminishing returns. Just another mismanagement of AT&T and Jeff Zucker."
"Another day, another price decline. Have to say T is at least consistent. lol. Probably on it's way down to $26 and later on, $25,$24,23,$22,$21,$20 by the merger. Sad situation."
"It's sad that when T was up just twenty-two cents, i felt like george bailey in It's a Wonderful Life...""well whadya know burt, burt, i'm alive, it's christmas!"" But now it's only up 14 cents, so it feels like clarence might put me back again."
hmm I have 0 shares ATM of T. but looking at all the crying Going on I think it maybe almost time to buy in.... maybe wait and see but def keep an eye on it
"“AT&T claims the cut is justified because its existing shareholders will receive new shares of the WarnerMedia spinoff. However, that new company will likely spend most of its cash on new media projects and its streaming ecosystem, so it probably won't pay a dividend.”This paragraph from MF article on T vs IBM Duvidend should be of interest."
Vote against management.
Glad I sold but I bought COIN. so cut your losses move on

"I bought AT&T at $40 a couple of years ago.During this time period , it is down more than 30% while S&P is up 50%. I just sold my 3000 shares and will lick my wound for a while. It was my worst investment ."
"HOMEGAMERS ! Just SOLD 24,000 of my 103,000 Shares..Took Advantage of the POP ! I HOPE 'T' SELLS Off Back To27.25 or So.. I'll BUY Em Back, and Continue To Try And AVERAGE Down A Little !"
Market recovers off the lows T just heads lower and lower - Need a statement from T zero ing in on spin off and showing huge benefits for T and shareholders - otherwise the plunge will continue!currently > 20% price correction already - T needs to put on their big boy pants - NOW!
S&P 500 is a better investment than ATT. Say this mantra 10 times daily.

"""T-mobile has had 6 other data breaches in the past 4 years,"" said Doug Schmidt, a professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University.""It appears that their IT system is particularly vulnerable since they haven't been able to rectify their known security issues during this time period, which should be concerning to customers."""
"Guessing the new dividend for T after the merger will be $1.00-$1.20. Only question is, will the newco WBD pay a separate dividend?"
"The spinoff of WBro with Discovery is a positive development, this will allow T to focus on telecom while lightening its debt load. HBO max along with discovery will find the price appreciation that it deserves once it expands its service all over the world, together these two entities have a lot of content. T will also find appreciation in this stock price as market sees it as more core focused with less debt burden. Just be patient, remember investing in real sense is transfer of value from impatient to the patient."
"Homegamers.....T is Like A Slow Turtle...I'll GLADLY Take 10-12 Cent UP Days...I'm Not Far From Even...Long 103,000 Shares...Avg $28.59....1 Divvy Received This Month of $42,000 on the # Shares IOwned As Of Last X Date.. 'T' Will PAY You WELL To Wait For PPA !"
"Homegamers... Still Long Over 79,000 shares at an average of 28.96. I sold 14,000 shares to trim my position some, 10 days or so ago. Tomorrow, I'll have enough additional funds to own up to a total of 103,000 shares. Based on today's late afternoon price, I can average down on the 103K shares to 28.62. If T stays at this price Tomorrow AM, I think I'll go ahead and average on down.... That's A LOT Of 'T' !I think I'm going to go ahead and Buy more... At least It's a decent Dividend the next 3 Quarters."
A good example of buffet's statement that ceo is the biggest risk factor to the company.

"People are forgeting how impressive the rescue/evacuation really was. In 2 weeks the Military got out 125K people under extreme hostile ""war like"" conditions.CNN won't talk about that."
The stock is the same due to the huge debt. I think Att will increase soon due to a new streaming and 6G internet.
"T is at the extreme low end of the price channel, @$27, at the high side, it is $38. Around 2011, VZ diverged and went higher and T kept going sideways/lower. I think $32-33 by mid 2022 near the time the deal happens is a good target. Certainly not lower. Of course, initially when the company is divided, the parts are equal to the whole. However, I think the better focus of both businesses will lead to higher share prices for both companies. Thus, I think it is a hold post spin-off. I am into T over VZ and TMUS and DOW and MET and other good dividend payers because it had a higher and sustainable yield. I was thinking I would draw down my T holdings and sell the Dicovery+TW newco once issued and buy T shares back. However, seeing the good results of Disney+, I think the prospects for the new streaming company are attractive and I want to hold both."
T has like 7.5% dividend at this low price per share. T pulls this deal off next year will be instant gain for T shareholders getting 71% controlling interest in new company. see T is actually only selling 29% of warner and getting discovery and billions in cash and unloading a bunch of debt. New contracts rolling in. They sold the anima for I think 1.17 billion that just closed in this Q. The new company will be worth more so you will see immediate gain on shares in that company. The more T you own the more shares of new company you will get. No worries you will make out either way deal or no deal if discovery shareholders or reg rejects deal.
"A few points:Government approval for the new company and dividend cut may take place sooner than mid 2022. Say, in early spring 2022. CNN is a negative for the new company due to its politics, both domestically and globally.It will better for TW-Dicovery to be politically neutural.Global market opportunities for TW-Discovery are unknown and uncertain, pie in the sky."

"Gee, the weather is nice today. Hopefully this valuable post will make it through the Yhoo screening process."
"Still laughing at that Craig Moffett price target of $66 for Verizon. LOL ""Telecom expert"" , ha ha"
For all of you who put a lot of stock in what the analysts say...........I've seen a lot of analyst predictions of $35 - $40 over the past few months but how many of the analysts predicted T would drop to $27.13 by August 29? And you believe these guys??? Hmmmmmmm
"Some factors impacting the share price: - Delta virus may slow down the economy, and hence T's business. - T's borrowing costs may increase if interest rates go up (Fed tapering).- S&P Global has negative outlook on T, two notches above junk. - T's management has lost credibility. - T is loaded with debt. After the new company is formed and some of the debt is transferred to it, they may load T with even more debt. For one thing, they're kind of addicted to it.Finally, merger may occur much earlier than Mid 2022."
"Do not buy AT&T for the dividends, wait for the real MONEY. 17% cd's just around the corner."
"I’m a long term shareholder over 40 years , stock is very depressed , any time a company has a spin-off shrehoders lose we will probably get one share of the new company for every 9 shares of att what a crock and the dividend will be cut in half that’s really taking care of long term shareholders it happens all the time in any spin-off"
T will own 71% stock in new company if it happens and they will gain controlling interest in discovery as well so the value will immediately go up. Shares will only be issued to T stockholders and discovery stock holders based on how much Stock in one of these companies you own. T is basically only selling 29% of warner to discovery they will own 2 thirds of new company and shareholders will have all the shares. Anybody else who wants has to buy from you. You will make out big if deal goes through. Still has to be approved by both discovery shareholders and regulatory commission and still at least 9 months away.
So maybe someone has an answer but what happens to T when the interest rates come up and they can’t finance their debt?
"I havent bought T in months and will not, just set back and draw a few Div. and get the wbd shares and see what happens!"
This drop from 33.88 to 27.02 is totally bogus they stole a bunch of peoples stock and making a bunch covering way lower. T is doing great and lots more contracts on the way. Govt. wants infrastructure everywhere. People want it everywhere.
"Just unloaded this #$%$ All of it. Now I feel a lot better! Held it for almost a year and basically broke even. There are many better choices to invest, even if you are simply looking for dividend.GLTA."
This stock is behaving like the company is being run by Joe B.
"Valuation: Buy RatedDespite a more simplified set of connectivity assets, lower leverage (UBSe 2.8x at YE22;2.5x at YE23), a better EBITDA trajectory and visibility on $20B of FCF in '23, impliedvaluation sits at just 5.8x PF '23E EBITDA and 7.3x FCF vs. VZ at 7.3x/11.6x. While adiscount is warranted (higher wireline mix), we expect the gap to narrow. PT is based ona SOTP: $28/sh for new AT&T (7x 22-23E EBITDA) and $7/sh for new DISCAUBS Target Price for T is $35."
Can anyone give me their best guesstimate as to how many shares an At and T shareholder can expect/hope to receive on the new company?
RSI for day/week/month/year is all below 30. Extremely oversold.
T is just doing wonderfully.The last time I traded T (except for buying a few Calls in July) was April after I became convinced this company would never do well under the current regime. Some of you cussed me out (ANDY and Vagipuss) or just laughed it off. So let's take a poll. Thumbs Up if you think I was right about T or Thumbs Down if you think I was wrong.
"AT&T and Verizon are rock solid stocks, out of favor in today's investing environment of growth, growth, growth. Last time I checked, everyone was attached to their cell phones, so that business isn't going anywhere. In fact, with wearables, more laptops/tablets having built-in 4G/5G, and more internet connected devices outside the home, AT&T and Verizon stand to have steady growth ahead.I like boring stocks like these. Give me my solid dividend (7% by the way is fantastic) and some boring 2-3% growth a year. I'll take old reliable.....all the way to the bank."
"Verizon is way off its highs also in the past six months, what do they have in common with a t and t : Huge Debt.... not hard to understand."
"Homegamers. Don't Give Up ! (TRUE Story)......Several years ago 2019 I think it was ,I had a position in ATTworth Approx 1.6 Million.. The stock just languished, I collected Great Dividends.. All of a sudden, in a VERY short time frame, maybe 3 or 4 days, it gained 3 or 4 dollars a share. I SOLD and made about $140,000 on thetrade...At that time, my BEST trade ever ! Now my 2nd best, I hit a BIG NCLH last year on a 2 day trade for about $160K. ATT Normally doesn't have these kind of runs, but look at past charts, they do happen. Currently, I AM ALL IN on an ATT Position with a little over 103,000 shares. Just a place to park some cash, in a NORMALLY Defensive stock, with a GREAT yield.. My avg price is $28.59/share/ However, I picked up a 42K Dividend check earlier this month on the # of shares I had at the X date at that time, so my current Paper Loss, counting my Divvy is about $108,000. Which really is Nothing on an almost 3 Million Dollar position....HANG IN THERE ! I think this will RALLY. In the meantime, just take the Dividend. It will either GO UP Before or after the spinoff....In the meantime,l just wait it out. IF I'm LUCKY Enough again to be in one of those $3-$4share POPS, I'd probably go ahead and Sell it, and pay the tax like I did before...."
"Good news ,,,T stock upgraded from a strong sell to a moderate sell by Jefferies."
Another trading day another day in the RED!Only good days are Saturdays and Sundays - TURD WILL BE EVEN ON THOSE DAYS!
AT&T will benefit from Infrastructure Bill when passed. Lot of money for telecommunications Infrastructure build. Shareholders should be compensated with 3 stocks when AT&T spins off assets becoming 2 other companies. Any loss of dividend of AT&T will be more then made up with dividends from 2 spin off stocks. I believe all 3 will grow and appreciate. Long T!!
I am absolutely disgusted with this stock. I don't believe management is being forthcoming and is intentionally being opaque. I could only hope that the SEC would inquire into their actions. Something here doesn't pass the smell test
AT&T is the most undervalued company I've seen in my career...Warren Buffet
"ATT is done, headed to $22"
This is pandemic price
For T the sum of the spin off (parts) will be lower than the whole! so where ever t is trading before the spin off - after the sum of the companies will discount the shareholders further. plus add in the dividend being cut in 1/2
"New 52 wk low tomorrow? When divvy was solid, I didn’t follow so closely (except to buy dips); now I am looking for a jumping off point."
People talk about poor management but in reality management is executing well. The sell off has zero to do with managements performance.
Read an interesting post about T this week . A retired SBC executive mentioned in 2008 that by 2020 T would have repurchased 30 % of outstanding shares and be debt free . That didn’t happen
Lots of frustration here. My question to you is why did you buy. I have been in for a long time because of the div. I don't care about share price. I need x dollars from this each year and I get it. Growth stocks could get me more but I don't want the worries involved. So again I ask why did you get in and was the reason really valid. It has not been a growth company for a long time. Price runs in a narrow range ( god for using options to make a few more bucks). The future now carries a big question mark and T therefore lost its identity as being a safe haven. It may actually turn out to be a big winner (which is what I think) but those that get T don't like to gamble.
yahoo is soooo funny.....i copied an article on yahoo news and posted it......but they took it off?
"If inflation is running at 7.8% and T pays 7%, we have a negative real rate of return. Nice eh."
you are gaining 71% in Discovery ... reducing T debt... Increasing T cash flow ... and T expects to do share buybacks when they get to 2.5x.... you have 3 Qs before anything happens if it even does.If I was Discovery share holder might not want to give up 71% of company. Regulatory could say to big or monopoly.
follow John Malone he will lead failed at&t to profit land just like in 1990 with the TCI and Liberty Media merger follow the rights

"Up 2 cents, T’s on fire!"
One of my top long term losing stocks. Frustrating to say the least.
What did i tell you months ago about this dog.
"Management - Step Up Your Business UrgencyWhy one year to achieve the end state? - The split of AT&T and WB should be a no brainer, since the DOL spent considerable time arguing against the original merger.- I can't imagine that the combination of WB and Discovery creates any kind of anti-trust, competitive issues.- The FCC should love the new AT&T focus on the core.- AT&T is not some gorilla in size, they represent only 1/10th the size of the big high-tech companies. In comparison, Musk in one year will be selling AI-powered flying Teslas and won't be asking for Government for permission. Who would you invest with?While I'm trying to overlook the past management deal mis-steps, current management needs to be more proactive and complete this deal or step aside.Can someone help me understand the one year timeline?"
"If you bought 1 year ago today you would be down 7.35%, the exact amount of the dividend so basically you would have all your money tied up in T with zero return (actually less than zero if you factor in inflation and taxes if you took the dividend)...if you threw a dart at board with all 6000 stocks the odds of you hitting one with a better return is better than 75%. *I have no long position in T but I do get in and out frequently and quickly for bounces."
"First i would like to say My Condolences to Charlie Watts Family ! R.I.P. Charlie !Your Music was great and now comes an end to an Era of the longest running rock band in the history of the world! Yeah you can get another drummer but Charlie had what they needed ,it will never be the same no matter what drummer takes his place ! Next i would like to say i see many shakey investors on here bad mouthing T because of the latest sale and merger to discovery , Don,t worry ! T stock after the sale of Warner will have the cash to balance their books for the first time in a long time and get their affairs in order !The dividend was nice but everyone knows not sustainable without growing the company , Now that the plant has been taken out of it,s small pot and soil has been added ,the roots will be able to spread out and allow T to grow to become the worlds largest telecom company in the world , Target prices have already been set fourth at $48 to $68 dollars by 2023, The cost of T is cheap and should hit $30 by years end !They are already hitting their expectations and with the new debt negotiations for lower interest rates their payments are already lower ,The dividend will still be considered one of the best at around .029 or possibly higher for this price range , we have until june of 2022 before the deal gets finalized but anything could happen in that time and the deal can also fall through ! My advice is Buy buy buy and hold and follow the money ,you will be rewarded ,i Guarantee it!"
"Sold another 1000 calls at $30 strike. Life is easy, how to earn money with this stonk below $29 by EOY."
Best to hold see how things shake out. We get the dividends at least 3 more times maybe 4 and by then things should be more settled. Best to be safe.
"Miracles can happen, T is in the green this morning."
"The News the past few days seemed to be good.....I don't understand this sell off. It's An Ouch....My T Account Is$156,000 In the RED.....OUCH.."
So long as we trade sideways above the 26's we will be fine.
"T has no money to even buy back some of its own shares to pump the stock up.....its flat broke.....All the small fries on this site are complaining but why do you all remain? The spin off will emasculate the once great dividend in addition to saddling the so called streaming wonder company, already down from a high of 71 last year to its pitiful number now, with the tens of billions of T debt from the horrible purchase of Time Warner......The major pension funds are slowly selling off in order not to force T stock down to its 20 level at the present time.......As the stock drops, the dividend also drops simply because 7% on 25 is less than 7% on 28......Stankey knows this will help him until the spinoff occurs......Does anyone think the future 3.8 % dividend will be special when there are dozens of decent companies making money already paying similar divies......Sadly, the market of today has no real value for dividends anymore, being a very different market than its was 20 years ago........instead of dividends, these companies pay their bigshots hundreds of millions each year and skip the shareholders, the small people who might need that money.....We've destroyed the middle class in this country and sadly, the market that T was once part of and failed to realize was their reason for existing, has now been mortgaged off to the banks, etc......T has died as far as i am concerned......it didn't understand its reason to be up in the market of today.......i got out as soon as i read the future tea leaves from stankey and lucked out by putting my money into companies which had a future and were going up, sadly without dividends......i did well that way......T was almost unique in its way, being a strong company, providing its shareholders with a great dividend, but lost its way and its all over.........finis !! There is no future except in the minds of those who hope that the spin off will work......my guess is Stankey will be gone before this occurs or shortly afterwards...."
"Markets reach new highs, while this toilet water gains 9 cents."
Just remember we are not getting 1 for 1 on the new co. We are getting 1 for every 4 or 5 at best. Figure that into your plans because people seem to be confused about fair value here.
It takes 3 months to get the dividend and 2 days to lose it.
The more it goes down the higher the dividend yield. Its a great dividend stock!
now they will delete my posts truth scares them
T is trading with the general markets that are going down this morning. Every time the Demwits are able to make progress with their bill that transforms this country into Cuba/Venezuela markets will lose value. Dah
"Have a great weekend. I'm down now to a little over 79,000 shares of T, having sold off some earlier today to raise some cash and lighten up a bit. My only other position is about 7K shares I have left in WW, having taken a position a few days ago on the selloff. My avg on my T shares, with my sale today, has risen back up to28.96/share. I figure to play T one of 2 ways.... I just got a really big dividend check, so my 'real actual cost'in what I have left isn't that far away. The 14K shares I sold today I had bought at 28.09, and some at 27.96.I REALLY Want T To Rally to $29. At that, I'd sell off a big chunk of my remaining position. I need to get diversified. On the other hand, if it drops again, to say 27.85, I'd probably go ahead and Buy another 15,000shares, to average down again. The I'd be somewhere around an average of 28.78. The market really scares me at these levels, though in theory, T would mitigate downside risk."
i looked it up...and t bought tci communications back in 1998. i think this love affair with cable and t vpointed them in this direction. further look at the philosophy. time warner love affair with the left and theirdug in support of all things left. and how better to do it when you control the press.. meanwhile this is munich revisisted.
"If you were stankey, what would you do to get the pps up? The bankers were accomplices in these bad deals, Elliott seems to have been wrong, strong performance in the core doesn't seem to have helped. Honestly, I don't think there's anything he can do but wait until the disca deal closes. I guess the only thing I can think of is to reach out to a bigger fish, like apple, and see if they want warner/disca pre or post deal. Not even sure that's permissible under deal terms, and i'd imagine that process would have been run before they signed w/ disca anyway, but it's really all i can think of. Kinda depressing. p.s. for cheetah and anyone else that can't read....this is prospective i.e. it's about the future."
I'm still a long way from Even.......Average Price $28.59....Gotta Start Somewhere !
"Here's Why AT&T Should Belong In a Long-Term PortfolioInvestors are struggling to keep up with the changes in the company’s business, and the share price reflects their question marks.T stock is down about 5% in 2021. By comparison, the S&P index is up over 19% so far in the year.After trying to integrate media into its business model over the years, AT&T finally turned the tables by spinning off WarnerMedia in a deal with Discovery. The merger will finalize in 2022 and trade under the new ticker symbol WBD.AT&T shareholders have taken a major beating ever since the Time Warner acquisition. It was a bold move to buy Time Warner in 2018 for $85.4 billion. Now, since the most recent spinoff announcement in May, analysts have been debating how much AT&T stock may be worth after the deal is finalized next spring.The spinoff is poised to make AT&T a pure-play telecommunications company once again. Management can now expand the 5G network while enhancing its fiber footprint in the industry. I believe this is good news for potential investors, especially given its current stock price.Here’s why.AT&T released robust second-quarter results in late July. It generated $44 billion in revenues, up 7.6% from a year ago. Adjusted EPS came at 89 cents, an increase of 7.2%. Free cash flow stood at $7 billion. The company beat analyst wireless subscriber estimates by a wide margin. It registered a 1.16 million increase in its wireless customers. This figure was almost four times the consensus estimates and double the gains reported by Verizon during the same period. The company ended the quarter with 87.5 million subscribers, representing a 22% year-over-year increase.In its media business, Warner Media also saw robust growth in revenues and subscribers. Advertising revenue went up by 49% and now has 67 million subscribers worldwide, with a forecast of 70 million to 73 million by year’s end.While the communications segment is generally a slow-growth business, AT&T sees its 5G wireless offering as its primary growth engine going forward. The company is deploying $60 billion in 5G wireless and focusing on what management feels it does best.A critical factor in soaring wireless additions has been lower subscriber churn driven by AT&T’s heavy promotions. While device promotions are generally limited to new customers, AT&T offers existing customers various deals as well. However, this approach has led to shrinking wireless margins for AT&T. In the long run, it may not be a sustainable strategy.AT&T stock trades only at 8.9x forward earnings, compared to almost 57x for T-Mobile. Therefore, from a valuation standpoint, T shares deserve to be on your radar, too.Second-quarter earnings performance supports the bullish argument for T stock. The company is making significant progress in expanding its 5G network while also retaining 71% ownership of a valuable media asset.AT&T will soon lose its dividend aristocrat status, as it will be cutting its dividend once the spinoff deal closes in mid-2022. The stock currently generates a 7.5% yield, one of the highest dividend yields in the S&P 500. Thus, a reduction in yield would not be as dramatic as it sounds. Income investors should also consider the potential for capital gains.The spinoff decision will likely prove be a bullish move for AT&T. Given the significant upside potential of its 5G wireless business, the recent pullback in T stock may offer a unique buying opportunity for long-term investors."
Trust and confidence in the management team are totally compromised. Something is amiss. These people need to be deeply vetted. I wonder if their annual report is truthful. Is ATT really a going concern or is it too big to be managed? I no longer buy the long-term spin.
Wow up 2 days in a row! Is T the WallStBets darling?!?!?!
"I Do LOVE 'T'.. I've Traded Probably A Million Shares of It Over the Past 3 Years......However, With An AVERAGE Now of $28.96/share, I'm Firmly In theBagholder Club."
"current T price is reflecting T at $18-$19 share after the merger which is oversold but continues to drop anyway. $20 share plus add back $1.50 dividend until merger plus add back $7 share for newco, WBD, today's price should be approx $28.50, not $27.40."
"Not much you can say about T stock, like too but cant, wouldnt be nice !"
"I AM Now ALL IN......Right at 103,100 Shares.. Average price on multiple buys the last few months is $28.59...Now That I'm ALL IN..... TIME TO RALLY !"
"Give me 2 good reasons you would buy this stock,besides the puny dividend?"
Well we are sitting at a pretty close to a 5 year low price. Rather depressing. Of course over the past 5 years we've gotten close to $9 in dividends which softens the blow a bit depending on how much you paid. I think that all the doom and gloom is a bit over rates but I don't see a fabulous and rosy future either. I'm in wait and see mode right now but it wouldn't take too much more bad news or just uncertainty for me to pull the plug.
looks like alot of people trying to get some of their money back today !
"Can you please all put your thinking caps on, if both VZ and T are going down in step with each other then this has zero to do with the management of the companies or fundamentals and more do to with the institutions reallocating their buying power into growth companies while interest rates are still near 0. What is so hard to understand about that?"
"The announced separation of Media makes strategic sense inour view. AT&T investors will own two more focused and moreflexible companies, each with a solid competitive position. Theprice AT&T shareholders are paying is in the form of a lowerdividend for the new AT&T (ca USD 1.20 vs USD 2.08 currently). This seems to be the reason behind the negative shareprice reaction after the deal announcement. Based on currentlyavailable information, we value the new media company at caUSD 11 per share for AT&T shareholders (12x EBITDA vs 19xfor streaming peers and 12x for the S&P500). Valuing the newAT&T at a peer dividend yield of 4.5% would represent a shareprice of ca USD 26. Combined, we get to a share price of USD37 post transaction (as of 23 July 2021)."
"Bought more today buying more Friday with $200,000 bonus. Will pay off over next couple years. patience!"
"Hmmm, this appears to be heading toward max pain, cut losses now?"
How T manages to turn red on a day like today is baffling. T must definitely rank top 5 in the worst stocks this milenia
One of the best paying stonks around at the price point other than BP.
"Come on 'T"" ! Currently Down $148,000 on My 'T' Position....I'm BEGGING For An....OVERSOLD RALLY !"
"Homegamers.....Let's OPEN T Tomorrow @27.40.... At That I can buy more, and get my average to just under28.60, for a little over 103,000 shares... I figure one day T will go back up, it's certainly OVERSOLD here..In the meantime, at least for the next 3 quarters, I can get a $54,000 quarterly dividend.. That's what Icall getting PAID WELL TO WAIT !"
