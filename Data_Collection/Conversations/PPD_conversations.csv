PPD has been a disappointing stock to own since inception.
Love it. Happening all over again. Fred Eshleman isn't CEO but this new guy appears to be just as good. Don't know where PPD got all this debt..but it will disappear in a few quarters. This stock is killing it in my portfolio...I won't make the same mistake twice. Buy and hold...buy and hold...buy and hold...Until they go private AGAIN and give you back your shares.

I'll be watching this stock closely....for numerous dips to buy. Pleased with the market down trend today as I see nothing but buying opportunities to accumulate shares of PPD.I'm not wealthy so it takes me months to build up enough cash to jump on great dips. 33.50 is a good dip but I'm not going all in at once...would love to see like ...29ish?? (we can all hope).
PPD reached an all time high at 35.36
This is a first...I'm the only one living on PPD Street (no one on this message board). Property value is going through the roof and I have no neighbors.
PPD reached an all time high at 36.07
Buy EYES and EARS.
"I know this board is ....a sounding board to myself (starting to get suspicious...does no one else see this stock? I must be sequestered) BUT, 52 week high today! ah-hem ....that usually a buy signal in the old school investing world."
JPMorgan reiterates underweight and $21 price target. The market is so messed up. Analyst says its worth $20 billion but its trading at $60 billion market cap. How can market be this not efficient?
PPD is up 7.07% to 46.04
FYI..there is nothing further to be said on this board. Well done to folks that invested last year. You will be paid out 47.50 at some point this year. What a ride..wish it went further and so long PPD.
Any growth potential here? I don't see how they have any distinct advantages over other CROs
LOL JPMorgan has a $280 target on BABA and a $21 target on PDD and the spread is blown out 17% today. Market is ridiculous with the most messed up lack of price discovery and passive no turnover of portfolios.

What's our stock buyout price set at?
I did NOT foresee a buyout possibility coming. I'm actually somewhat shocked. I thought PPD as a CRO leader would try and grow in it's own right.
PPD is down 5.83% to 27.32
Lucked out today. Had a gtc order in for 26.76.

I have been wondering when this stock would tank guess it’s today’ what’s up ??
The most growth potential in a CRO right now is a small rapidly growing company called Bioanalytical Systems that trades under the symbol BASI - old established outfit finally getting their act together. Worth a look. Could double revenue this quarter.
"So there is so much volume here, as we all know what's going on and the price is barely moving. This makes no sense."
Heavens to betsy...when will Thermo Fisher and PPD close out this deal! This is dead money in my portfolio (except for the extra buck per share on the buyout).
PPD is down 4.91% to 33.92
yeee-ha! ride' em cowboy!
PPD is up 4.92% to 36.50
"I am going to accumulate on Thursday ...good entry point on the pull back (as I opine...since i'm the only retail investor in this gold mine). I saw ONE article concerning PPD on Seeking Alpha in the past month (it was excellent and well thought out). Pfizer has a miraculous cure for COVID...doesn't matter, people still don't know what CROs do...great news for PPD!"
why is my TOS platform showing PPD as Pre-Paid Legal?
"IQVIA would also be a good fit with PPD due to its emphasis on data mining and virtual CTs, but likely could not stand up to TMO in a bidding war."
trading in a few minutes
Question...does anyone know if our shares in PPD get (or can get) converted to TMO? I think I read we just get paid 47.50 a share sometime by the end of the year.

With this type of volume - the price should have doubled already. Noone is selling with a buyout in place!
Did anyone listen to the call? What did you think?

This company used to pay dividends until it went private. It was also the 11th best performer on the Nasdaq in 2001.
Won't PPD be involved in some of the Covid-19 related clinical reasearch/work for multiple pharmaceutical companies?
It all looks good except that 5 billion in debt.
I just came in today. I think it's brand new ipo.. I hope..

Bought more today. Nice pull back for buying opportunity.

"This is a 10 billion dollar company.. competitor stocks such as PRA Health Sciences, IQVIA going for over $100 dollars a share. This will pop."
PPD is down 12.76% to 15.59
Wouldn't it be cool if a large competitor like DHR submitted a rival bid?
They had some interesting insights about PPD on (http://Experttrade.uno). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
PPD is down 5.83% to 25.66
Funny how money is now tied up in this company….waiting on the payout but they won’t give me one single penny. I’ll hold out for the extra dollar per share.
"I LIVE IN THE TOWN THIS COMPANY IS LOCATED, ITS DOING EXTREMELY WELL!!"
PPD is down 4.94% to 34.07
Better CRO leverage with BASI?
How will the pandemic affect PPD? Is it business as usual or are they closed?
PPD reached an all time high at 34.21
I purchased calls for 11/2021 a fews before the sell announcements. Do anyone have any input on what I should do?
PPD reached an all time low at 18.00
Does PPD do their pre-clinical work in-house or do they use someone like Covance or Bioanalytical Systems?
Haled ?
Well...I'm stumped. I thought this earnings release was phenomenal. Beat estimates and forecasting solid growth. What's not to like? Apparently the powers that be in the market don't like it...market was gangbusters today and every stock I own is up...except PPD. No idea. Oh well....guess accumulate slowly. Institutional ownership has to increase eventually once the market sees this company.

Womp - rather would have let it ride for a few years

Ummm...hello? Why the ridiculous tank today...insane market boost on a Friday. Every freaking stock in my portfolio up at least 2 to 7 percent...PPD not so much. This company used to mint money (2001 to 2010)...whats up guys?
PPD reached an all time high at 34.70
"Not sure if investors fully realize that PPD is a player in a lot of Covid-19 related research:“PPD is bringing all of its expertise in the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies to bear to support our customers as they and we work with urgency to deliver COVID-19 therapies.”-PPD Chief Medical Officer Karen Kaucic, M.D."
PPD is down 5.59% to 27.00
Can't wait for 4Q Earnings release and 2021 guidance... I view this earnings release as a key inflection point for PPD and continued share price growth. Fingers crossed.
PPD reached an all time high at 32.52
PPD is up 4.91% to 29.25
"Accumulating.Convinced this is a growth stock in my portfolio. BTW, I find it's helpful on these Yahoo message boards to let folks know what my position is...it can be funny (people like to check you when you're wrong or right).I'm long XOM, PPD (accumulating), NLY (just holding NLY), and new position in DDD."
PPD is up 13.88% to 19.12
Press release says deal closing by end of year. Why so long? Antitrust should not be an issue - PPD is mainly a CRO doing drug development and a bit of post-market work. TMO does everything but this. Might be a bit of overlap in the Labs space. I am no expert in this space - anyone? Maybe some international approvals needed?
PPD i believe in you!!!! this should be $100 stock!!!
"• Fourth quarter revenue of $1,046.9 million, representing 7.0% growth over the fourth quarter of 2018 • Full year revenue of $4,031.0 million, representing 7.5% growth over the prior year"
Wow .... same pattern in 2002ish timeframe. Nice pullback today...was getting a little overbought for no reason. Expect 37 - 40 by end of year. There is a real possibility.. folks..(apparently myself since no one is on this board) that this company will have some blow out quarterly earnings announcements over the next 6-12 months. Think about it...they SPEED UP testing in order to get FDA approval for the drugs (ahem..or vaccines) that pharmaceutical majors are pushing. If only there was a global pandemic that needed a fix.
