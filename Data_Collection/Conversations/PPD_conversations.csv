Time to switch to BASI ???
Funny how money is now tied up in this company….waiting on the payout but they won’t give me one single penny. I’ll hold out for the extra dollar per share.
I’m out. Not waiting for the 47.50 buyout. Gotta put the money to work elsewhere.
"I LIVE IN THE TOWN THIS COMPANY IS LOCATED, ITS DOING EXTREMELY WELL!!"
Question...does anyone know if our shares in PPD get (or can get) converted to TMO? I think I read we just get paid 47.50 a share sometime by the end of the year.
"I own both shares, but I think PRA is undervalued as compared to PPD."

Womp - rather would have let it ride for a few years
PPD is down 11.22% to 20.42
"Hey MyCrazy, can I get some real estate on here? Seems like you are the landlord. Stumbled into this neighborhood (ppd) and think I like it."

It all looks good except that 5 billion in debt.
"• Fourth quarter revenue of $1,046.9 million, representing 7.0% growth over the fourth quarter of 2018 • Full year revenue of $4,031.0 million, representing 7.5% growth over the prior year"
I just came in today. I think it's brand new ipo.. I hope..
Did anyone listen to the call? What did you think?
"This is a 10 billion dollar company.. competitor stocks such as PRA Health Sciences, IQVIA going for over $100 dollars a share. This will pop."
who's brave enough to buy right now?
Heavens to betsy...when will Thermo Fisher and PPD close out this deal! This is dead money in my portfolio (except for the extra buck per share on the buyout).
Any growth potential here? I don't see how they have any distinct advantages over other CROs
PPD is down 16.27% to 16.67
lets goooo ppd love you!
"I am going to accumulate on Thursday ...good entry point on the pull back (as I opine...since i'm the only retail investor in this gold mine). I saw ONE article concerning PPD on Seeking Alpha in the past month (it was excellent and well thought out). Pfizer has a miraculous cure for COVID...doesn't matter, people still don't know what CROs do...great news for PPD!"
PPD reached an all time high at 38.46
Well...I'm stumped. I thought this earnings release was phenomenal. Beat estimates and forecasting solid growth. What's not to like? Apparently the powers that be in the market don't like it...market was gangbusters today and every stock I own is up...except PPD. No idea. Oh well....guess accumulate slowly. Institutional ownership has to increase eventually once the market sees this company.
PPD is up 14.25% to 23.77
Wouldn't it be cool if a large competitor like DHR submitted a rival bid?
PPD reached an all time low at 18.00
This is a first...I'm the only one living on PPD Street (no one on this message board). Property value is going through the roof and I have no neighbors.
The most growth potential in a CRO right now is a small rapidly growing company called Bioanalytical Systems that trades under the symbol BASI - old established outfit finally getting their act together. Worth a look. Could double revenue this quarter.
Can't wait for 4Q Earnings release and 2021 guidance... I view this earnings release as a key inflection point for PPD and continued share price growth. Fingers crossed.
I did NOT foresee a buyout possibility coming. I'm actually somewhat shocked. I thought PPD as a CRO leader would try and grow in it's own right.
What's our stock buyout price set at?
"Accumulating.Convinced this is a growth stock in my portfolio. BTW, I find it's helpful on these Yahoo message boards to let folks know what my position is...it can be funny (people like to check you when you're wrong or right).I'm long XOM, PPD (accumulating), NLY (just holding NLY), and new position in DDD."
Wow .... same pattern in 2002ish timeframe. Nice pullback today...was getting a little overbought for no reason. Expect 37 - 40 by end of year. There is a real possibility.. folks..(apparently myself since no one is on this board) that this company will have some blow out quarterly earnings announcements over the next 6-12 months. Think about it...they SPEED UP testing in order to get FDA approval for the drugs (ahem..or vaccines) that pharmaceutical majors are pushing. If only there was a global pandemic that needed a fix.
"Not sure if investors fully realize that PPD is a player in a lot of Covid-19 related research:“PPD is bringing all of its expertise in the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies to bear to support our customers as they and we work with urgency to deliver COVID-19 therapies.”-PPD Chief Medical Officer Karen Kaucic, M.D."
"I know this board is ....a sounding board to myself (starting to get suspicious...does no one else see this stock? I must be sequestered) BUT, 52 week high today! ah-hem ....that usually a buy signal in the old school investing world."
Bought more today. Nice pull back for buying opportunity.
This company used to pay dividends until it went private. It was also the 11th best performer on the Nasdaq in 2001.
With this type of volume - the price should have doubled already. Noone is selling with a buyout in place!
