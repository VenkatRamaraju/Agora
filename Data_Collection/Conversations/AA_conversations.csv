just bought another 1000 shares
"Incredible earnings report. Based on revenue and income growth, as well as debt reduction, I see AA at $70 this year and over $100 next year."
"Nothing to worry about here. After such a monster day Friday and staying positive yesterday, it was due for a bit of a pullback. Commodities prices are set to soar with no end in sight, this will be a $70 stock before you know it, and if the madness continues could see it at $100 next year. Today was simple consolidation."
"Yesterday aluminum was down more than 5% and AA was down more than 7%, today aluminum is up 3.25%, AA is only up slightly out of proportion. The Wall Street sharks are playing games."
"A day or two ago, I called 48+ as the support level. So - I was wrong! It is right here where you see it now at 45+, The charts are saying AA is way oversold now. I would be comfortable buying another 1000 here, but I can't, I don't do margin anymore, and I'm all in at 51.35. I believe AA will be back there or higher after the investors conference call on November 8, Hang in there Longs!"
"Due to the shortage of energy in China, they have cut the supply of Aluminum significantly in last 2 months. Since China is relaxing the electricity cost control, It is very likely Chinese producer will announce AL price hike to cover their cost of buying electricity. Regardless of the current AA stock price fluctuation, the AL will price increase and short of supply will prompt a round of stock coming back to higher price."
Relax the company is buying back 500 million in shares. I'm not selling a dime
I went long at $54.20 today with 3K shares. This should give others a buying opportunity at about $50 in a week or so. I'm prepared to buy more at $50 also.
I've made a lot (for me) of money off swing trading options on AA as it moved between 46 and 51. And a bunch on the big climb after the latest earnings. I figured I'd see a new range after earnings that I could play and am quite surprised it fell so far and so fast. Will be interested to see if this settles back into the 46 to 51 range again or if it will reset to the 50 to 55 range which is my current guess.
"Even with the nice gains the past two days, the valuation for AA is still very compelling. I donâ€™t know of any other company with ratios of EV/Rev less than 1.0 and EV/EBITDA less than 5.0."
"I hope the company is scooping up lots of shares at these bargain prices as part of their $500 MM buyback. This price drop may be a blessing in disguise. The more shares they can repurchase, the greater the rebound in share price will be by the end of the year."
Great buying opportunity!
"Good things on horizon at Alcoa. I don't work for AA or anyone else and not a pumper or thumper. I am a regular stock holder. As for me, I will be holding my 500 shares of AA for about 1 or 2 years or maybe longer and will wait for a slow steady good return on my investment. i might get another 500 or 1000 more shares based on the economy and if the good news keeps coming from AA over the next months ahead. I like AA because I don't think it is a big risk to loosing my money and I can wait out any kind of economic slow down. I decided to invest in AA because over the last 5-6 months, I've been reading that the aluminum based products that AA makes are in high demand and aluminum prices are rising which means more profit to AA. Also Alcoa has a factory in Brazil that will be fully on-line in 2022 and it is suppose to be using ""full green power"" by 2024 I think, and the startup should help boost profits as customers are lost from China. I have been reading that China has cut back on their aluminum production because their factories are terrible polluters so they have decided to cut back manufacturing aluminum for the time being and it could take quite a while to refit their plants to green energy away from coal. I also like that AA management has been keeping costs down to the point that they are starting to give a cash dividend, for those that don't know a dividend is a cash payment into your brokerage account. That is, for each stock you own of AA as of Oct 29th, you get a cash payment, automatically into your stock account automatically. Granted it is not a huge dividend; but it a very positive sign and shows that management is on the right track and giving $$$ back to the share holders. Read this about the plant in Brazil from Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-aluminium-ahome/column-alcoa-powers-up-in-brazil-as-china-aluminium-powers-down-idUSKBN2GJ14T"
Somehow I started to see the beauty of this stock.. it's like an old steam locomotive. I hope once it's going to hit the 88 mph. Alu price may help on that soon.
"AA is getting support at 48+. Now we need a breakout above 52, and it could happen any day now. Be cool - hold on. Just wait!"
"Hi, can anyone explain or help me understand why the AA share price drop so much over the last 3 days?It really does not make any sense to me at all when the company just released a great earning report with dividend payout and share buy back.The CEO of Alcoa saying the market for Aluminum will continue to be strong. So why would it drop so much within the last 3 days?It does not make any sense to me at all.Thanks"
Any reason AA share drop so much today? any bad news on the company?
"A year ago spot aluminum was around $0.85, and now it is $1.35/ lb. And it looks like inflation pressure from our debt money system will keep it going higher. I think we will see a rebound in the AA price very soon to at least the $54 area."
"Bought AA and ZIM, both have great fundamental. Now looking for a 3rd stock, any suggestion?"
"Well,I jumped back into AA again was justtoo hard not to,a $10 decline was just toohard to pass up, however,my past with AAcertainly isn't stellar,I sold 4000 shares 7-27at $38.15 because I got tired of the yo-yopricing,I'd be up a few thousand,a week laterdown a few, hopefully,I'll regain a few of thosemissed dollars,my new BE is $46.87."
