"With AL pricing down fractionally today. this is a buy! They are making tons of $$ and have the lowest carbon ESG product on the market. China is a buyer (importer) now.,less manufacturing of their own. will be big for AA. This is oversold (baby....bath water)AluminiumCommodity2,555.15 -44.35 -1.71%12:08:44 PMMI Indication"
Wow AA up over 11% on the day. I just bought in yesterday. I’m tempted to just take the quick profit here.

"According to short, ratio AA is overbought. Will it hold current level above 40? I am very curious .."
Nice.. up 66% on my option. $42 by Friday.
AA crossed the 50 day ma today. That's a good sign on where the share price is headed in the near future.
I sold all my AA options a bit ago at 41 for a very nice gain and had been kicking myself as it kept rising and waiting for another chance to get back it. Didn't think I'd see it this low again. I'm back in baby!
That's a solid 40! And I am still confident it will be pushing 50 by end of summer.
"Hmm...the name of the game today is push lower and lower and lower....I've been through this before. ""Market mobs"" are likely trying to wipe out as many as possible and position for a gap up on Mon when they will sell back to some of you at 2-5% premium. Besides this is the 4th day of negative with a huge push downwards on positive earning news. I don't know to what level this will be driven today, maybe to 32.50 or even 32.00? I will accumulate and report the avg price at the end of the day and then will see on Mon where we are. Tough game but nerves of steel and confidence in high Al prices being here for longer, will prevail. Good luck to everyone!"
still not a buy. look at 1month chart.
"Strange price actions of AA, hope that there is nothing wrong, we try to do the math Abd follow logic Abd fundamentals, but it seems the market does not care any more about strong fundamentals and good companies"
"Just curious what happens when prices eventually correct to historical norms. Alcoa Corp. AA, -1.71% said late Thursday it reached record earnings and per-share profit in the second quarter as its aluminum prices rose more than 60% year-on-year."
Do you think AA will ever reinstate dividends ? Just asking for a friend...lol
"At Last, closing above 40. Still looking for the 50's by the end of summer."
"Come on AA, finish strong baby!"
"With aluminum prices at all-time highs, Alcoa is in the strongest position in its history. I am very bullish and feel that the share price will surpass $60 in the short term, with much larger gains in the long term."
The price of aluminum is up again today.
Buy the rumor and sell the news. I believe the markets see this cycle topping out and a correction of prices have to occur at some point. Nothing grows forever and smart money is always the first to exit. Maybe it’s time to watch from the sidelines for awhile.
Thanks for the 1k shares at $34.48. Much appreciated!!!
"Manipulation, shakeout before the next leg up."
How can there be no news article explaining how Alcoa drops over $8 in 5 days (near 20%) and $4.60 today alone?
They had some interesting insights about AA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Don't sell , hold on, AA just like girl friend, need waiting forever, when you married, you will get the good result in the end"
Alcoa upgraded from neutral to buy by Citigroup [MT Newswires @ 0808 ET].
"For the day, the chart says the stock will hit approx $34.20 in the next hour or so. Then if it manages to climb to $35 from there, next resistance will be $37. There is a 60-70% chance though that once it hits $34.20, it will retrace to $33.00-33.50 before resuming a more solid uptrend. It's just chart play with decision points at some targets based on what other participants react."
"I can see a lot of bears but earnings stand at approx $1.5 for the quarter. This extrapolates to $6.0 for the year implying a $90 price for the stock at a 15 P/E. Conservatively if we assume only 50% chance for this to be a sustainable trend, the stock price should go to $45-50. Why metal prices would go down at the beginning of an economic cycle? Most electric cars, that are megatrend, want Al. My bet is that this will go to $50 over one year and to $40 over the next 2 weeks, once the short term games are exhausted."
"This happened the quarter before last. The price was around $26.00 per share. After the earnings report the shares tanked all the way down to $18.00, then it climbed to a high of $44.00. This stock is being manipulated. I’d love to see the Reddit ape army grab on to this one!"
"Let's look at some of the indicators:50-day moving average, just crossed below that and it looks like it likes to hover around the 50 day MA.200-day moving average - we remain well above that and has been well above it since November. RSI - 41: so approaching oversold but not quite there. MACD is droppingThere is no crossing of the Moving Averages happening anytime soon. But with the infrastructure bill moving nicely, aluminum prices high, China cutting back on exports, and broad economic growth, I'm very comfortable buying more at this point."
what's happen ?

"keep your powder dry boys, going to be a rough few weeks."
"Chinese heat wave driving up coal prices and causing electrical power shortages, expected tom impact aluminum production. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/china-s-heat-wave-is-helping-to-drive-coal-prices-higher-again-1.1629596"
"From MF article and I couldn't agree more: ""Needless to say, investors are worried now that metal prices are showing signs of cooling down, and that's weighing down the stock price. That said, Alcoa is on a stronger footing now, and it might be too early to suggest the commodity upcycle is coming to an end. It's a wait-and-watch situation for now.""Like I said before, check the current spot pricing for AL. still holding strong at all time highs.Today was just a pull down with other miners"
"Aluminum producer Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) has been on an impressive win streak lately, up 1.1% at $41.17 today as shares charge back toward their May 10, two-year peak of $44.42. The 10-day moving average has also helped guide the equity higher, and year-to-date, AA is up 77%. Plus, there's evidence AA isn't done climbing just yet, with a historically bullish signal."
18 more minutes left in after hours trade and people are selling on the earnings news.
Look like a good news
AA is up $3.37 today. That's about 4 years profit ROFL @ buyers
Stay course and make money with Alcoa. It looks it's headed to 40 as I predicted 5 days ago (see my other post). Al prices are on the uptrend and this stock is likely headed to 40 near term with next resistance level at 50. Short term beating down games appear to have subsided.
"So what triggered this huge drop, this, on the heels of recent upgrades? Is their pending negative news?"
Any insight or thoughts as to why Alcoa is underperforming as of late? Aside from Delta variant and Afghanistan.
