time to get out
I bought my first 16 shares of aa :)
"INTERESTING SIDE NOTE- AA has about 186 million shares outstanding. Institutional ownership is around 87%. Judging from the daily average volume only 3% of the float is determining what the market value is for this stock. Wrap your mind around that concept of reality. Bottom line, lots of folks are either trapped long or are in for the long haul regardless of the up and down swings. Best wishes, looks like we'll be in quarantine here for awhile."
the tarrifs are on aa ready to fly
"Alcoa Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the top U.S. aluminum producer was helped by strength in its alumina segment"
looking at 40 again this week. 50 will happen this summer.
Consensus eps of $1.34 is on high side. Price doesn't reflect this consensus.... A more reasonable price to reflect $1.34 in eps for the qtr should be around $40. Shorts want to take this down..
"I hold another metal miner , but I watch y'all ............Boy it's good to see you bounce."
"We are watching the mighty game power of wall street again. Any stock can be driven to non-sensical values in the short term. Based on options games, the stock needs to come close to $32 or $37 for options bets to turn profitable so there is a lot of push. It looks the $32 target is pushed right now...."
"Options market says the big boys are betting large on AA being 21 by mid-April (5,5% from here) and 25 by mid July (25% from here) so I'm thinking AA is a BUY BUY BUY"
"I can see a lot of bears but earnings stand at approx $1.5 for the quarter. This extrapolates to $6.0 for the year implying a $90 price for the stock at a 15 P/E. Conservatively if we assume only 50% chance for this to be a sustainable trend, the stock price should go to $45-50. Why metal prices would go down at the beginning of an economic cycle? Most electric cars, that are megatrend, want Al. My bet is that this will go to $50 over one year and to $40 over the next 2 weeks, once the short term games are exhausted."
For what is worth... just spoke to my friend Broker at Morgan Stanley in West Palm Beach and he told me that many institutions are buying Alcoa. He is recommending it to his clients and they are accumulating it in the heavy side. They have it with a price target  of $23 - $25. No wonder why AA has gone from $7 to $12 in just two weeks. I am buying more tomorrow. Good luck to all the Longs !!
Does anyone know if the stock buyback program that was announced in 2019 is still active or has the buyback of shares been completed?
"What ever happened to Alcoa's patented micro mill process that was unveiled when Klaus was CEO? They claimed that this process reduced the processing time to make aluminum from days to hours and was supposed to give Alcoa a huge competitive advantage. Since the company split more than two years ago there have been no further updates on the micro mill process. Did the abandon this technology or are they still trying to commercialize it? Given the glut of aluminum in the market, significant cost reduction in the manufacturing process appears to be the only way they will be able to get the share price back to 2018 levels."
"Excluding certain costs, the company reported a profit of 66 cents a share, surpassing the 50 cents a share analysts polled by FactSet expected."
Anybody know why this is still dropping?
$AA $ 50/55 per share
"Does anyone have any insight on where we're at in the aluminum commodity cycle? I pulled up the stock price chart and going back to 1/1/09, the average time span between peaks in the AA share price is 33 months. Here is some other interesting data showing extreme swings between the peaks and the troughs over the past 10 years. On 1/1/09 the stock was $17.64. Only 10 months later the stock traded at a high of $38.74 on 10/1/09. The next low point 7 months later was $24.16 on 4/1/10. It only took 10 months for the stock to rebound to a high of $42.44 on 1/1/11. The stock then continued on a steep downward trend and hit a low of $18.79 on 4/1/13. The stock then went back on a 16 months uptrend more than doubling to hit a high $38.66 on 7/1/14."
Look like they were selling all the overhead calls. Should go back to the 50dma tuesday. No bad news here
$AA today also it went down without much negative news before earnings. It went to bottom of 28.16 and bounced back. Wait for regular market and watch tomorrow.. Should cross $31
At the open today it will be 10 bucks lower than it was a week ago. Its the same AA over and overagain. Buy the rumor sell the fact. Look out below !!!!!! Down 6.30 and falling fast
Analysts keep saying what a buy AA is. Problem is the Stock keeps falling. Its one day wonders are always followed up with big selling.
Berenberg Bank set a $42.00 price target on Alcoa (NYSE:AA) in a report released on Monday morning. The brokerage currently has a buy rating on the industrial products company’s stock.
stock down huge pre mkt great buy since most analysts see 65 to 70
I would have thought AA would benefit from this Tariff.
"Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Alcoa has $14.25 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another"
"If we could get one piece of positive news about tariffs or an end to the strike, this stock could hit $43-$44 easily IMHO"
when aluminium gets hot again we are gonna see offers on the table again. Vaguely remember bhp wanting to offer 40bln for the old alcoa.
"Alcoa (AA - Free Report) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 106.25%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company would post earnings of $0.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of 152%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times."
THE WORLD USES A LOT OF ALUMINUM AND WILL NEED A LOT MORE IN THE FUTURE....Practically every field of endeavor uses aluminum in some form. New alloys are being developed that will make it even more indispensable. This sleeping giant will awaken very soon. My best to all longs.
AA could fall below $27 today! I’m a huge Buyer at $27!!!
Let the Massive Sell Off begin.This management Team rewards them selves with Huge Pay increasesand Big Bonus checks. The Retirement fund is overflowing. Every oneis enjoying AA except one. The Stock Holders. We the Stock Holders areat the very bottom of the list from this Management team. Where is a StockBuy Back?? Where is a Dividend ??? Its time for a change where the StockHolders are Number 1. Not the usual Bend over here is your reward !!!!!
Up to 40$ down to 35$ nice game no movements
Alcoa price target raised to $79 from $75 at JPMorgan AA - The Fly
"Strange price actions of AA, hope that there is nothing wrong, we try to do the math Abd follow logic Abd fundamentals, but it seems the market does not care any more about strong fundamentals and good companies"
"My lot in life,,, company x reports bad news the stock falls,,, buy company y (AA) and they report good news and beat estimates and they fall..."
I bought Alcoa years ago before their split into Arconic- I subsequently held my Alcoa shares for several years after the split until I was able to sell them in 2017 at $40 which I was happy about since this was my break-even point and was glad to get out-within 6 months the price ran up to $65-moral of the story: don't try to figure out the price action on this stock
"This happened the quarter before last. The price was around $26.00 per share. After the earnings report the shares tanked all the way down to $18.00, then it climbed to a high of $44.00. This stock is being manipulated. I’d love to see the Reddit ape army grab on to this one!"
"Not much downside from here. 32.25 would put in a double bottom. Be nicer if they announced something positive for shareholder investors. I.e. buyback , dividend ??? Sell out to BHP."
"IMO this belongs right back where it was before earnings. That would be funny to see it reach that target in the next two weeks. I would have thought the Rusal sanctions data was already baked into the price prior to earnings, however, I guess not. The revised guidance did nothing but make the $48 price, prior to the selloff, more of a reasonable valuation. At a $41ish price, this stock is trading as if aluminum was $1700 a ton not, $2050. Congrats shorts on your push, and congrats to those who bought in around the $40’s. $6-$7 higher within the next few weeks (maybe sooner). Anyone have an update on Rusal and sanctions data. Last I heard, Deripaska hadn’t stepped down yet. So September could have fireworks, unless the administration would like to bend the knee again."
"With AL pricing down fractionally today. this is a buy! They are making tons of $$ and have the lowest carbon ESG product on the market. China is a buyer (importer) now.,less manufacturing of their own. will be big for AA. This is oversold (baby....bath water)AluminiumCommodity2,555.15 -44.35 -1.71%12:08:44 PMMI Indication"
"I predict this to go hard green at 1:00. Why people sold AA yesterday AFTER seeing it close green on a dow -600 day, I do not know. However Margin Calls may have had a play."
AA will hit $70 next year.
"Loaded up with more short at $23.50... this is a gift  !! Hold the line shorts, don’t be afraid my Virgin child let all your intuitions run wild... lol  a Rod Stewart song. Alcoa is overbought and overpriced !!"
Do you think AA will ever reinstate dividends ? Just asking for a friend...lol
"Aluminum producer Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) has been on an impressive win streak lately, up 1.1% at $41.17 today as shares charge back toward their May 10, two-year peak of $44.42. The 10-day moving average has also helped guide the equity higher, and year-to-date, AA is up 77%. Plus, there's evidence AA isn't done climbing just yet, with a historically bullish signal."
"Anybody know what's driving AA higher in PM. CENX is heading in the opposite direction, down over 10%. What gives?"
"I'm buying heading into earnings. I know this is kind of a dog in the steel sector, but you have to like the positive tailwinds with the Bidenfrastructure plans.. another competitor I'm long on (NUE) expecting a massive beat next ER, I expect good things here too, it's not as volatile or fun as X and CLF but I prefer steady and undervalued plays with market so bubbly."
cenx reporting today. should be a blowout.
"Despite the short term pain of a plummeting share price, which has yet to find a bottom, the EPS estimate for this year is $0.85 and $2.47 for next year. This company has very little debt (almost all of the debt stayed with Arconic), and given all the cost cutting that they've done over the past 2 years to improve operating margins, I wouldn't be surprised if they blow through these estimates. Not trying to hype here. I think there will be more pain in the short term and this thing could slip below $20, but assuming that we don't slide into a major recession before the 2020 election, I'm looking for a major reversal to begin in Q3 of this year."
these low prices are insane! another new 52w low again or up on the day???
Pickup some more at $17.53 holding 36 shares now
Alcoa downgraded by Ford Equity Research due to its latest price movement. This hyperbolic rise in one month in unsustainable!! Soon many more downgrades will come.
buying opportunity !!!! just buy and hold it for 6 - 8 months you will be very happy !!!
AA is up 5.00% to 53.15
Alcoa upgraded from neutral to buy by Citigroup [MT Newswires @ 0808 ET].
Who sold yesterday at $31.42?? 
AA crossed the 50 day ma today. That's a good sign on where the share price is headed in the near future.
"well, there went all of yesterday's gains"
Morgan Stanley upgraded to a Buy 3/24
"It was over 30 for 6 days, but closed above only 3. This stock needs leg and breakout to 32-33. It is stuck in a low 27 to mid 29 pattern for months. My worry is it falls below 27 and sets new low holding pattern"
"hold tight, most metal / mining stocks taking a big hit today. we'll get some bounce now."
"Aluminum, steady up %10 since april. Price of nat gas might hurt a little. Good entry now."
"Did I read this right ???? $64 !!!Bottom-line strategy: The charts of AA are positive looking and appear to be headed higher. Traders could go long AA at current levels risking to $31. Our price targets are $41 and then $64. Get an email alert each time I write an article for Real Money. Click the ""+Follow"" next to my byline to this article."
It will be red tommorow !
Nice.. up 66% on my option. $42 by Friday.
"CEO Harvey says rather than tariffs, the Trump administration needs to provide incentives for producers to restart and create new capacity, cooperate with allies to eliminate unfair subsidies abroad, and support investments in research and development of smelting technology. Harvey states the tariffs actually hurt Alcoa."
"Amazing stock and a big thank you to China for creating a decade worth of sustainable demand for Alcoa. This is essentially an undervalued growth stock that has underperformed the market since 2018. Amazing set-up right here, look for it to trade down to somewhere between 33-34 and if it dips into the 32s even better, because I'm going to buy a whole lot more."
"Didn’t I tell u gals and gents, it’s a $40 stock , history will repeat itself cheers"
That's a solid 40! And I am still confident it will be pushing 50 by end of summer.
"Last week I didn’t add at this level and it jumped 4 points, I’m on the fence , if I do add and it jumps again, I won’t pass the opportunity to sell just what I add , don’t forget 4 weeks ago we jumped to 45 for a cup of coffee before falling to just over 35 , day traders are loving AA"
"Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform on Alcoa, Raises Price Target to $15 [Benzinga - Benzinga]"
Most likely an earnings miss today. Consensus is unreasonably high. If market truly believes it will earn 1.34 it should be trading at $40now..
"AA GREEN DAY FINISH WOULD BODE WELL, as markets bleed red across the board. Long positions get stronger day by day."
"What happened, does anyone know?"
will finish flat or green today.!
"Two upgrades this morning by BMO Capital and Deutsche Bank to 38 and 41 respectively. Two days ago, to 39 by GS. Go figure... Retracement to a week ago at low 30s range?"
OUCH! What happened today?
Looks like solid support at $20. Is that the bottom? Fundamentals still look good in AA IMO.
Aren't AA and ARNC just wonderful stocks! That is if you like losing a lot of money. They're wonderful!
"It’s holding well... today I added another 5,000 shares at $6.75. I really think this is a safe stock with big upside potential. Once we see a little sign of improvement, which we will it will be up in the $22 - $24 levels again."
"From a low of $12.86 on November 4th to $17.50 on November 16th ?? This is a 36% increase in share price and market cap. I don’t buy it... it has to go back to at least $15 this week, AA has not made any money in years. I consider this the PERFECT SHORT !!"
what happened to the buyback that Alcoa was looking at in Oct 2018? did they buy the $200 million already? buybacks are not always the greatest for companies since stock always seem to fall after and it is always tried to convey that buyback will raise stock price. I think dividends are much better way to go
"guys I bought at 40.5 , not sure what to do ? shall I sell all ? Will it go back to 40?"
Alcoa raised to Buy from Neutral by Citigroup. pt 52
"I want in so bad I’m hoping for a little better entry as it bounces up and down, hopefully I don’t miss the boat"
Artificial intelligence driven algos will determine the price of AA while picking the pockets of bagholders
Copper becoming so expensive it's leading some is is leading some electricians back-to-back to aluminum as the as the quality of copper wire has has been deteriorating over the past decades while aluminum wiring has improved in quality.
Coronavirus definitely at play. No one can figure out how it plays out but the downside is becoming limited. What happens if the virus spreads and aluminum plants are shut down in China. Wouldn’t that be a positive for prices?
Yahoo finance estimated target is over $59 and they are always very conservative. $60
"AA has been showing support at 39.54 and resistance at 45.12. Buy rating: 7, according to 9trading."
If Alcoa can get the tariffs exempt from Canada AA should fly if not it’s a huge expense for the company. Trump should do the right thing for this American iconic company
"So far so good ... managed to hold on to all my shares while Schwab changed the margin requirement from 30% to 50%. This is good for the workers of Alcoa ... my 651,560 shares indicate I believe in the American industry. Let’s make it happen in America!"
aa has enormous cash flow low debt there Is no reason it shouldn't be 55 but it isn't
"If one is seeing a call loss over 80% with an underlying cost basis of 100 shares long at a higher cost as well, why not sell a put at a premium equal to 100% your call loss, same Expiration. On expiration (July 16th) your loss on the call is equal the gain on the bullish put you just may Own 100 shares at a paper loss but you own them and you just averaged down if you can afford it. BUT you do not see any option loss which is a derivative. It seems to logical. What is my error. Anyway. I rather own 200 shares at a lower cost, then 100 down a bit, and a 100% wipe out on a July 16th call."
upgraded to conviction buy but sold hard to match s&p 500 decline. machines are not very bright but we have to respect them cos they move the market
They sure do seem to be holding Alcoa down both Thursday and Friday. My guess is they are trying to get every share they can and should have a good up week next week. Just got a few more shares.
Wiping up the margin calls. Everybody knew it would beat. ..
"LME 3M Al up another $23/MT to $ 2244/MT. Midwest Regional P1020 premium up another $ 0.0025 /lb to US$ 0.1100/lb which is $0.015 /lb higher so far this month. Forward MW OTC premiums continue to move higher. DOC submitted their 232 report on Friday and Trump has until April 22 to respond. Even though I am totally against primary aluminum protectionism with more downstream jobs being displaced than smelter jobs being gained , I feel Trump will place a duty to save face with the USW."
"Funny article this morning about Alcoa and upcoming earnings. It says "".... Alcoa — with solid asset base, internationally diversified operations and strong management team — is the world’s second largest bauxite miner and the largest alumina refiner outside China. Its tactical priorities, including reduction of complexities, strengthening of the balance sheet and rewarding shareholders handsomely, have set it apart from other players in the industry"" How have shareholders been rewarded handsomely over past 2 years? stock has fallen and no dividends. so nothing in return for buying."
"Just be happy you are not in Arconic (ARNC). Down -57% in one trading day. AA will survive, bought shares just under $8.00."
guys bought it at 41... should I exit or you feel it will jump back in few week ?
"I am interested in AA. So have this question for those who may have been following this stock in the past.I see that the stock had a terrible plunge from $90+ to $17+ In Jan 2009. Since then, over 12 years, it has recovered but has never been able to go about the ~$35 level. Why is that? And is there anything that may propel the stock back to its earlier highs?Thanks."
"Crushed earnings by 15%. Beat revenues. Have the tariffs they wanted. I don't know why this wouldn't explode upwards........Ummm, perhaps I should clarify. I meant to say would instead of wouldn't. Should be obvious from the context."
WHEN JIM CRAMER TALKS PEOPLE DO JUST THE OPPOSITE...Up almost 10% today.....
I bought AA thinking copper is becoming too expensive and industries are looking for replacements especially automobiles industries. Aluminium has and will always be the ready alternative. AA will play a major role if the infrastructure bill goes forward and also to an alternative for copper. This is a winner for many years to come
Wouldn’t removing 10% tariff on aluminum for Mexico and Canada help Alcoa? Yet the stock fell friday
"MOST ACTION HERE CONTINUES TO BE SHORTS AND TRADERS. At some point the Institutional MM's will make an entry to stop the bleeding. Trillions of $ have just evaporated over the last week and for most people the only exit strategy is panic. Buy when others are fearful if you believe in that business, or hold for this to will pass."
Unless someone say something that would give me hope I will be out by tomorrow morning. 
Alcoa stock lately claws its way up $2-$3 over a 5-7 day period and then in 1 day gives it all up to then just claw its way back up.It cannot get over the 36-37 range before falling down to 33's
This is going to be $40 by Friday.
"AA has 25% overstock of aluminumalumium price has decreased by 18%all this will negatively affect the resultsAA's largest market is the aircraft industry, which is currently doing badlyall this will have a negative impact on tomorrow's results"
We added shares today:-). My wife was able to buy under my average and so was I. Our economy is going to roar. Yes things will change. If I had the money I would buy 25% of this company right now no problem at all. Wow.
1.49 vs est of 1.37
aa has profits of 3 .2 billion and tarriffs may costt as much as 120 million at the absolute maximum but probably much less this selloff is a political bs story trying to show that tariffs were horid
"Manipulation, shakeout before the next leg up."
Years ago I didn't buy at $8 then it went to $12 and the news was negative and it continued to go up. So back to where this was back then. What is the deal with this. I read they are tightening up and closing some plants. Is this going to go back to $40
"Sales rose 5% to $3.34 billion, in line with the $3.33 billion analysts predicted."
So they basically killed it. I'm sure it'll drop $5 tomorrow on the news that they had the best earnings ever in the history of the company.
I sold 800 shares on $38
The price of aluminum is up again today.
"What do you folks use to track aluminum pricing? Is it a futures symbol for Aluminum or is it Bauxite? I know where to find Iron Ore, Copper, Silver, etc. I don't know what gauge is tracked for this company's natural resources."
Aluminum is one of the greatest elements ever discovered. All its quality are great. I use aluminum every day more than any other single element. I have it in my hand now.
"So what triggered this huge drop, this, on the heels of recent upgrades? Is their pending negative news?"
Buy more in the after hours!! It will be up tomorrow!!!!
Pricy still
"Alcoa is a company carrying $2.7 billion in debt currently. Apply the $670 million Alcoa will receive from the Kaiser deal, and that number could come down to just $2 billion -- only a bit more than the $1.7 billion in cash Alcoa has on hand. Result: Net net, Alcoa could emerge from this deal very close to net debt free, a prospect that should obviously please its shareholders.Combine this with the likelihood that any U.S. national infrastructure program that benefits steelmakers like U.S. Steel will almost certainly benefit aluminum producers like Alcoa, and it becomes clear why all of these stocks are enjoying a bull run today."
They had some interesting insights about AA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
You would think the company would start buying back the $200M worth of shares at these depressed levels
"this company is one of the biggest Aluminum in the world, they produce alu 7075/6063 for shipyard, we bought a lot for our factory. with ev soaring. i think Aluminum will be higher next months. specially in May."
"Is there something going on with AA that we don’t know? Each time the market is down, AA is down more than twice."
Don't worry too much. Aluminium average selling prices are up 8-10% since last earnings call. Expect eps around $1 for this quarter.
"Aluminum prices rose to a near 9.5 yr high on ""yesterday"" 3/3/21, caused by concerns of supply cuts in China, the world’s biggest user and producer of the metal."
Markets turned green along with aluminum futures up nicely. Why are we still stuck under 25? Get headed north AA
"""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

Spirit Airlines is making huge purchases of 737s.
Wait for $33-35 to buy.
Any ideas on what is driving the share price up? Are investors expecting a beat on earnings tomorrow?
Crazy timing on the upgrade lol but definitely a BUY
"This is the lowest it's been since 2009 when the market was at it's worst. Then it dropped to 13.77., and 6 months later it was climbing back in the low 30's"
They had some interesting insights about AA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Can anyone reasonably explain this decline? Thanks.
on the way back to 60
key reversal.. day..a mini one at least .. closing $36

Is this run all due to good earnings or is aluminum pricing helping as well? This stock was just in the low mid 30's a few weeks ago. I am rather surprised. I follow another aluminum producer South 32 and it is not seeing this positive movement.
"Just Sold Short 2200 shares of AA at $20.13. This is a Pure Earnings play. I expect AA to come in with a poor earnings release in just a few minutes, I expect them to miss consensus estimates for both EPS and Revenue, and the stock to sell off, to lose $20 and fall to the $19 level. I know, they will probably offer good Guidance and supposedly 2020 is going to be their turnaround year, but I expect traders to still sell this off on bad numbers today. Limiting my hard capital exposure on this one, because she is already down a lot. I really wanted to Short this at $21+. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
This stock can easily double
anyone feel AA is at bargain price on 09/06/2018? IMHO
"My West Palm Beach friend broker that works for Morgan Stanley told me to stay away from Alcoa because it’s overbought. I told him that I had a very big short position, and he told me that I would make money because Alcoa has gone up to fast on misc news. “The first lesson taught to new traders and analysis with the RSI is how to trade the overbought and oversold levels. New traders and analysts are taught that when the RSI reaches 70 or higher, it is an opportunity to scale out of a long position or consider a short position.If the RSI drops to 30 or lower, then it is an opportunity to cover a short position or open a long position. It’s important to understand that the RSI was designed at a time when markets were very much range-bound. “This climb up has to stop  on Monday !!"
Look like a good news

"guy I got in at 40.5 and had more than 800 shares . it would a significant loss , Amy tips here ?"
The spot price of AL is and has been higher recently than in 2018. Pricing has stabilized in the 2400 range. The SP was in the 50s at that time. People need to sit back and let the earnings pour in. SP going higher after this consolidation. Tomorrow should reverse higher based on 3 day trendline. my 2 cents
Buy the rumor and sell the news. I believe the markets see this cycle topping out and a correction of prices have to occur at some point. Nothing grows forever and smart money is always the first to exit. Maybe it’s time to watch from the sidelines for awhile.
"Sold my AA in August at $14.50 ... moved to TCNNF with a 10% of my portfolio position in MMNNF. Made $1.3 million since then while Alcoa went down. ACB was up 40% yesterday. But, if Alcoa returns to $6, I'm all in! Thanks for the elevator ride Alcoa!"
"Anyone know when the union contract negotiations are scheduled to wrap up? I don't thing we're going to hear anything from management to stop the slide in the share price until the new contract is signed. Sadly, a plummeting share price is in management's best interests as they try to negotiate as many concessions as they can from the union."
"They need to close or curtail all unprofitable smelters immediately. The price of aluminum is not going up anytime soon. Management needs to structure to a smaller org. This company is a pure aluminum play, and their production costs are high on the industry cost curve"
"keep your powder dry boys, going to be a rough few weeks."
Nice to see this big pop today. Hopefully this is the March that will take it back to 25.
A guy in china ate bat soup and Alcoa went to $5 bucks.
"sold today 16.51 held this since 7, looking at shorting...any thoughts?"
"nice moves today! ... valuations of PS/Sales and EV/EBITDA + small float might make the @stocktrader forecast of $35 - $40 prediction attainable, although I think that is somewhat on the high end, but I'll gladly take it!!"
Aluminum up almost 3%
That's more like it!!! Come on baby!
I sold all my AA options a bit ago at 41 for a very nice gain and had been kicking myself as it kept rising and waiting for another chance to get back it. Didn't think I'd see it this low again. I'm back in baby!
The question is> why is AA taking such a beating on the stock market? Is there more wrong with the company than we small investors know or is published?
"JPMorgan has slashed its price target on Alcoa(AA) to $57 from $79 while keeping its overweight rating, to reflect lower-than-expected realized prices in Q4 and lower price forecasts for 2019, while the stock is discounting too steep of a decline in alumina and aluminum prices."
"Hmm...the name of the game today is push lower and lower and lower....I've been through this before. ""Market mobs"" are likely trying to wipe out as many as possible and position for a gap up on Mon when they will sell back to some of you at 2-5% premium. Besides this is the 4th day of negative with a huge push downwards on positive earning news. I don't know to what level this will be driven today, maybe to 32.50 or even 32.00? I will accumulate and report the avg price at the end of the day and then will see on Mon where we are. Tough game but nerves of steel and confidence in high Al prices being here for longer, will prevail. Good luck to everyone!"
First time bought AA. I cannot resist.
bought at $41.00 should have waited a little longer and got a better price. but cant do anything but be patient i guess.then i'll join '' MAN '' and GOOD BYE AA!!
"The old saying holds true, better to be lucky than good. I made the mistake of thinking I was buying American Airlines in late March by buying 2500 shares of AA at $6.58, once I realized my mistake I decided to hold it. Now I am very happy and holding this until after COVID is well gone"
Analyst believe price should be between $26-30. By next week. Read article on yahoo finance under. Future of Alcoa
Market cap expansion year for alcoa. 5bln to 30bln.
"At Last, closing above 40. Still looking for the 50's by the end of summer."
"According to short, ratio AA is overbought. Will it hold current level above 40? I am very curious .."
Jump in hot EV rocket NOW before too late$AAPL $AA $MRNA
It's unbelievable to see this drop from $22 to 13.92 in ONE month !!!! What is the driving force?
"Best earning ever , back in the $45 ish"
"""Alcoa shares move higher after Commerce Department to begin requiring aluminium import licenses"" Alcoa could gain momentum with the price of aluminium reaching 3year highs and the aluminium import licnses! If you are long dont sell!"
"Let's look at some of the indicators:50-day moving average, just crossed below that and it looks like it likes to hover around the 50 day MA.200-day moving average - we remain well above that and has been well above it since November. RSI - 41: so approaching oversold but not quite there. MACD is droppingThere is no crossing of the Moving Averages happening anytime soon. But with the infrastructure bill moving nicely, aluminum prices high, China cutting back on exports, and broad economic growth, I'm very comfortable buying more at this point."
"AA I Bought Friday @ 15.48Here is my reasoning 1. Tylor Craig, InvestorPlace Author adds AA to his 2/6/20 article, (Three Beaton-Down Stocks To Sell Now). 2. Unknown Author of Zack’s Equity Research in a 2/6/20 article (The Truth About Market Timing) suggests that buying AA would be a bad idea now because you would be reacting' to market volatility, rather than envisioning market trends. 3. Reuter’s Author, Unknown promotes panic in their article, (Alcoa’s Australian Aluminum Smelter Hit By Power Cut Amid Heat Wave 01/30/2020. 4. Bloomberg (Alcoa Drops as 1 Million Dollar Revamp Faces Awash in Metal) 01/16/20Yes, that’s all bad news with true statements and that’s why I bought AA on Friday. When the big boys constantly remind the common investors of bad news, that’s when I buy in. I put a stop loss incase I’m wrong but I believe the institutions are seeing a trend reversal coming soon and they want to scare common investors into selling so they can buy in at a good price before a trend reversal."
"I have been looking forward to writing this article. Alcoa (AA) has been on my radar for many years, and I love the cyclical characteristics of this Pittsburgh, PA-based company. Especially after the company spun off Arconic (ARNC), it is even more interesting to focus on Alcoa as it is increasingly becoming a pure commodity play. That said, the just released Q4 earnings were bad. Earnings were down and well below consensus expectations. Nonetheless, I am sticking to my bullish call as the company's main problem was lower commodity prices. Just like its management, I expect the company to grow sales volumes starting in the first quarter of 2020 and expect capital gains after a very weak year of 2019. The economy is bad, but we are seeing signs of a recovery that should benefit cyclical companies like Alcoa."
My prediction is Alcoa will close on a bad day like today at $14.95 - $15.00 !!! This company with good bankrupted soon. Sell sell sell and lock  in your gains folks. The big boys will leave you holding the bag .
AA will open around $12.75 tomorrow!! What a comeback investors want Trump... go USA .

"Looking like we could have reached a bottom, should be a nice buying opportunity for longs"
Can someone explain to me why Alcoa has such a high earnings estimate for this quarter?
"-- Revenue and income highest since 2018, which was a record-setting year-- Realized 20 percent sequential increase in revenue on higher prices and strong shipments -- Generated net income of $175 million; sequentially, adjusted net income increased 206 percent to $150 million -- Adjusted EBITDA excluding special items increased 44 percent to $521 million"
do we need more downgrades? stock was downgraded on tuesday and wednesday yet it finished at the high for the week.Fingers crossed that we can get $2-$3 more out of this into the earning date. Just want to dump like 60% of my holdings
You can now buy AA at 1975 price
Alcoa upgraded to buy at Goldman Sachs with 38 target...
big haircut. Markets not predictable despite AA is a good stock. AA tells one to get out of markets.
just bought in heavily at 38.67. Will be up a few dollars Tommorow. I don't have a worry
Hard to tell what today's price action tells us except that it is very similar to Q1 (April 15th report) where the stock closed down for the regular session then a pretty good bounce in after hours and next day trading.
"RSI is under 30, Why even more sell off? Their debt is manageable. Will Chinese Aluminum dumping hurt them even more? One to watch at least. AA was in a symmetrical triangle until wonderful 2020 came around."
"I started buying in February thinking it was underpriced then. Even went so far as to sell $15 calls. AA is also my largest single position, occupying around 15% of my portfolio (now, and Q1 2020). You get big returns by concentrating, but lower risk by diversifying. Thankfully a big bet on AA has been paying off, even though seeing $6 was difficult.I luckily started the year with a lot of cash and a plan to buy solid value companies with good management. Watching some Tech skyrocket had me suffering from mild FOMO, but most of my own choices have recently been coming back strong. Thanks AA, for the validation. Unfortunately I used up my cash too quick to take advantage of the $6 back then but I'm satisfied."
I was never worried
"How's it hangin', Robert?"
I’ve actually revised my entry point: between $32 and $33
Alcoa is up 7.25% to 43.47
what's happen ?
Good chance to escape.
Could see this pop over $10 tomorrow with good news
"From MF article and I couldn't agree more: ""Needless to say, investors are worried now that metal prices are showing signs of cooling down, and that's weighing down the stock price. That said, Alcoa is on a stronger footing now, and it might be too early to suggest the commodity upcycle is coming to an end. It's a wait-and-watch situation for now.""Like I said before, check the current spot pricing for AL. still holding strong at all time highs.Today was just a pull down with other miners"
"Leading aluminum stock, Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA), has been under severe selling pressure since April 2018. At that time, the stock traded as high as $62.35 a share. Since that high pivot, the stock has been selling off and now trades at $28.93 a share. The next major support level that looks solid for the stock will be around the $25.00 area. This is where the stock broke out in November 2016. Often, larger time-frame breakout levels will serve as solid support when retested. This should be an area where the institutional money defends the name."
When will Canadian tariff on aluminum be removed? I'm in a hurry.
looks like DCB today
"What happens when these hot stocks fall, they are the first to come back. Buy the :$):$ dips"
I see Citicorp reduced it's target price from $53 to $33 today-how can they possibly have any future credibility with an estimate this far off????
Alcoa is up 14.18% to 13.29
"AA has been trending down throughout the AH session. Has no forward momentum and will not be able to gain such momentum tomorrow, until the stock goes down more. The question is, how much more?? I think the answer is, at the very least this has to go below $19.00 tomorrow. Could it keep going to $18.50, or even $18.00?? Absolutely. Somewhere between $19.00 and $18.00, bargain hunters will come in and the price will stabilize. My plan here is simply to hold my Short position tomorrow, probably until late afternoon. I won't be able to find the absolute bottom, but I am confident I will Cover my Short with a very nice profit, and then move on to PRGS as a very promising Long play. Just starting to look at the companies reporting next week, and already one is jumping out at me as a potentially very good Long play: INTC. Late next week they report, but when I spot a potential play, I like to start monitoring it early, and keep doing more research and Due Diligence each day, as time allows. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
GS owns a stockpile of aluminum in Detroit and uses it to manipulate the market. Buyers beware.
Wow AA up over 11% on the day. I just bought in yesterday. I’m tempted to just take the quick profit here.
What is the next support for the stock? I want to correct my position!
"Come on AA, finish strong baby!"
"Support, Risk & Stop-lossOn the downside, the stock finds support just below today's level from accumulated volume at $21.83 and $20.82. There is natural risk involved when a stock is testing a support level, since if this is broken, the stock then may fall to the next support level. In this case, Alcoa Inc finds support just below today's level at $21.83. If this is broken, then the next support from accumulated volume will be at $20.82 and $19.81.This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved $1.84 between high and low, or 8.24%. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of 6.02%."
I can't wait for AA earnings beat and 8% pop. Aluminum scare and prices going UP.
"(RTTNews) - Below are the earnings highlights for Alcoa Corp. (AA):-Earnings: $309 million in Q2 vs. -$197 million in the same period last year. -EPS: $1.63 in Q2 vs. -$1.06 in the same period last year. -Excluding items, Alcoa Corp. reported adjusted earnings of $281 million or $1.49 per share for the period. -Analysts projected $1.34 per share -Revenue: $2.83 billion in Q2 vs. $2.15 billion in the same period last year."
Any insight or thoughts as to why Alcoa is underperforming as of late? Aside from Delta variant and Afghanistan.
We need over 38!
"Buy today and for the next 3 days and you’ll be a happy camper , buying when the stock is trending lower is my key to a Big bag of cash"

"Futures slightly up... the market will go up a little and turn Red midday !! It’s Friday and correction will start. We will see Alcoa at $20.35 tomorrow by the end of the day. Alcoa is super overbought and priced for perfection, it has gone up too much !! Will retrace to $18.34 soon. Sell and lock  in your gains before the big boys"
"I bought into AA. I’m not drinking the Fed’s Kool-aid that inflation is “transitory”. When the pundits all start using the same word, it’s more groupthink than serious analysis."
any thoughts of when AA pays a dividend or special dividend?
Be patient aa will be up to at least 55 before earnings. It will bounce.
Sold at 44 today with 10% profit. I will move on next investment. Thanks AAMost likely it will go up further. Good luck to longs.
If Monday is a big Down day for market...this stock will probably be green. This look like a good spot to take a position today down.
"They beat all the results, it is going to the moon now."

"FED giving pressure to all raw materials to control the 10 year bonds.But the inflation would let the price of raw materials in the rally.Two power struggling, I still hope to see AA go to $47 in next week."
How can there be no news article explaining how Alcoa drops over $8 in 5 days (near 20%) and $4.60 today alone?
market is total #%%% now.

still not a buy. look at 1month chart.
"Alright, I'm out. Taking my daily of $70K. Good luck all! :)"
Stay course and make money with Alcoa. It looks it's headed to 40 as I predicted 5 days ago (see my other post). Al prices are on the uptrend and this stock is likely headed to 40 near term with next resistance level at 50. Short term beating down games appear to have subsided.
AA is up $3.37 today. That's about 4 years profit ROFL @ buyers
"WHY ALCOA WILL SURGE. 1) Despite massive headwinds on pricing, there is NO Way the Trump or Ross will minot push for much import curbs in a politic ally charged election year. Legislation and improved tariff regimes will be the main catalyst and tailwind to restoring AA back to $15/share in the near future. 2) The second catalyst will be rotation from Covid-high stocks (and stay at home beneficiaries in a closed economy) into seriously underperforming Industrials. 3) Third catalyst will be a massive uptick in vehicle demand as people shift from public transport to private. 4) Forth catalyst will be a long term deal with Apple for specialized high margin Aluminum products."

"yeah, but you post all kinds of smack for weeks now...anyhow....I owned a boatload which I sold @23.7. Sold all my steel too (MT). And sold lithium (ALB). Holding copper, will buy more.

"Reports Q2 revenue $2.7B, consensus $2.76B. ""In the second quarter, our Aluminum segment rebounded despite weaker metal prices, and we reported a solid cash balance, even after sizeable cash outlays,"" said President and Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey. ""We also maintained strong operational performance across all of our businesses."""
Idk why anyone would have been bearish on AA? Just look at the numbers of AA finance. Great looking chart as well for the technicians. Not saying I’d get in now! I got into AA years ago but I’m not selling!
AA up 40 percent from 2 weeks ago when StockTrader posted to short it at 17....what a genius
They beat earnings big time just now
aa just got upgrade from goldman sachs
Let’s go back to $40+
We could see 50 inside a month. Good luck and don’t sell prematurely. But if you do take your gain look to buy back
Wow this goes down on good news. Its not going back to its all time high
"For the day, the chart says the stock will hit approx $34.20 in the next hour or so. Then if it manages to climb to $35 from there, next resistance will be $37. There is a 60-70% chance though that once it hits $34.20, it will retrace to $33.00-33.50 before resuming a more solid uptrend. It's just chart play with decision points at some targets based on what other participants react."
"Alcoa is up 7%, I don’t see any news. Any idea why, , not that I am complaining, thanks."
I'd be better off betting on Dogecoin... or the Bengals.
Morgan Stanley just came out with a list of 22 stocks NOT to own or buy and Alcoa was on this list. AA will not get hammered especially after the last two days. With aircraft manufacturing at a standstill it could hurt the demand for aluminum. The profit taking begins. We will probably see $6.
"Aluminum will be high in demand in the future, I’m holding this forever."
AA should react from here if this is ABC correctionThe 2 legs are equal @ 31.7Personally if it doesn’t react i will forget this stick for few months
"Just curious what happens when prices eventually correct to historical norms. Alcoa Corp. AA, -1.71% said late Thursday it reached record earnings and per-share profit in the second quarter as its aluminum prices rose more than 60% year-on-year."
INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: In the 1800's aluminum was more precious than gold. today this is one of the most versatile metals on the planet. There will be an important and protected need to provide easy USA access to this vital resource in the future....

AA has a market cap of $1.27 billion and yet cash in the balance sheet of $929 million with book value of $23. Folks it doesn’t look any better than this.
Alcoa is up 7.70% to 40.62

Alcoa is up 7.91% to 22.79
according to the conference call aa will have 400 mil in the second half to do buybacks and dividends this is a huge windfall to people who will do thier homework
Alcoa bears are feeling way too cocky here. Big lots were on the buy side in the post-hours last evening. That's how I saw it anyway. We will know soon enough. The Jeffries call this morning is a tell. They cut AA target price from $40 to $39. That is a bullish tell right there if you know how to read between the lines on the normative Wall Street chicanery.
i dont know about 100 but 60 seems likely
"When a hedge fund (forget name) got involved in this loser it forced the share price way up. I took advantage and sold my ENTIRE position at $49 a share. I took all the proceeds and put it into AMAZON. What a decision that was. One (if not the best) of the best decisions I have ever made in investing. Also, sold the entire position of ARNC (another LOSER formed from split with AA) and put that into AMAZON. The difference: I'm WELL into 6 figures to the good with AMZN vs. the COMPLETE LOSER 'AA'. And I mean 'WELL INTO'. Feels like a dream."
Interesting reaction to story about Chinese dumping on the market. Recent story about tariffs on Chinese Aluminum? Interesting.
"I was in this COMPLETE LOSER a few years back and sold when activist ELLIOTT got involved in it. The stock soared and I was able to get the HELL out of it. I redeployed the funds in to AMZN. What a decision that was. This COMPLETE LOSER went on to crater to about $6 a share. Meanwhile, AMZN was making new ALL TIME HIGHS including TODAY. I will never buy material stocks or anything like it. They are losers. Unless you are extremely lucky you will be sitting on losses unless you get lucky like I did. AA is a COMPLETE LOSER!"
AA at 60 by end of summer
"The spot price has risen quickly, useage shoud drop off for the next few months, and now the spot price is high enough to start recommissioning the closed manufacturing plants. Intraday and 5 day charts both look very top heavy to me. The big question is “how much room is there from here to make a profit?” Not much"
Impressive move today!
"A very simple explanation regarding brokerage houses.1. free trades = more trades roll in and out of positions. 2. trading on apps via cell phones. this is the ultimate betting app.3. clearing trades. clearing houses must increase capital requirements, more volume = more cash needed.4. changing margin requirements.......eliminates (helps) a whole bunch of under water margin calls.5. traders are trading stock prices, not fundamentals like valuations (funny)when a company like $nok traded well over a billion shares several times, it just takes some time to re group, but they will get it fixed.........and some folks will get hurt. none of this is new, just look at year 1999....rinse and repeat.$gme $aa $bb $koss"
