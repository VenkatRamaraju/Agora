That's a solid 40! And I am still confident it will be pushing 50 by end of summer.
"If one is seeing a call loss over 80% with an underlying cost basis of 100 shares long at a higher cost as well, why not sell a put at a premium equal to 100% your call loss, same Expiration. On expiration (July 16th) your loss on the call is equal the gain on the bullish put you just may Own 100 shares at a paper loss but you own them and you just averaged down if you can afford it. BUT you do not see any option loss which is a derivative. It seems to logical. What is my error. Anyway. I rather own 200 shares at a lower cost, then 100 down a bit, and a 100% wipe out on a July 16th call."
"What ever happened to Alcoa's patented micro mill process that was unveiled when Klaus was CEO? They claimed that this process reduced the processing time to make aluminum from days to hours and was supposed to give Alcoa a huge competitive advantage. Since the company split more than two years ago there have been no further updates on the micro mill process. Did the abandon this technology or are they still trying to commercialize it? Given the glut of aluminum in the market, significant cost reduction in the manufacturing process appears to be the only way they will be able to get the share price back to 2018 levels."
Nice breakout on a choppy day !!! +60 is just a few more dollars...weee
"Same price action everyday. Moves higher in the first 30 minutes, puts the high in for the day and then sells off the rest of the day. Breakout is above $49.44 with volume."
Alcoa is up 14.18% to 13.29
"AA I Bought Friday @ 15.48Here is my reasoning 1. Tylor Craig, InvestorPlace Author adds AA to his 2/6/20 article, (Three Beaton-Down Stocks To Sell Now). 2. Unknown Author of Zack’s Equity Research in a 2/6/20 article (The Truth About Market Timing) suggests that buying AA would be a bad idea now because you would be reacting' to market volatility, rather than envisioning market trends. 3. Reuter’s Author, Unknown promotes panic in their article, (Alcoa’s Australian Aluminum Smelter Hit By Power Cut Amid Heat Wave 01/30/2020. 4. Bloomberg (Alcoa Drops as 1 Million Dollar Revamp Faces Awash in Metal) 01/16/20Yes, that’s all bad news with true statements and that’s why I bought AA on Friday. When the big boys constantly remind the common investors of bad news, that’s when I buy in. I put a stop loss incase I’m wrong but I believe the institutions are seeing a trend reversal coming soon and they want to scare common investors into selling so they can buy in at a good price before a trend reversal."
Hiis a time for selling ? A.A is near to the top value since 5 years....
"PM high is $52.14 ATH was $52.45. Will there be a new all time high in the first 30 minutes of trading in the day session? Call option expiration today and the $50 strike has over 11,000 open interest. Will they be forded to cover or will they pull it down to make the $50 calls worthless at the close. Just some ideas to consider."
Criminal stock manipulation.
Can someone explain to me why Alcoa has such a high earnings estimate for this quarter?
Do you think AA will ever reinstate dividends ? Just asking for a friend...lol
"Alcoa Corp (NYSE: AA) shares are down 1.5 percent following a mixed fourth-quarter earnings release.Anyone tell me what part of the earnings release is mixed,, I could not see it??"
Amazing Earnings so happy for this company. Been in since $5 and holding for life
Will be in Red. As soon as I see buy back mean will drop big time tomorrow
"Alcoa Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the top U.S. aluminum producer was helped by strength in its alumina segment"
"Perfect time to add some shares, no reason for such an important drop. Good luck to all !"
anyone feel AA is at bargain price on 09/06/2018? IMHO
Aluminum up 1%
"Incredible earnings report. Based on revenue and income growth, as well as debt reduction, I see AA at $70 this year and over $100 next year."
AA crossed the 50 day ma today. That's a good sign on where the share price is headed in the near future.
I sold all my AA options a bit ago at 41 for a very nice gain and had been kicking myself as it kept rising and waiting for another chance to get back it. Didn't think I'd see it this low again. I'm back in baby!
"Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Alcoa has $14.25 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another"
Guinea Coup bringing us to the moon in the next month
Supply / Demand Demand will explode with infrastructure
https://discord.io/Tradings
They sure do seem to be holding Alcoa down both Thursday and Friday. My guess is they are trying to get every share they can and should have a good up week next week. Just got a few more shares.
Look like a good news
"Anybody know what's driving AA higher in PM. CENX is heading in the opposite direction, down over 10%. What gives?"
First time bought AA. I cannot resist.
They had some interesting insights about AA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"With the Guinea coup, very likely to close at about $50"
"With aluminum prices at all-time highs, Alcoa is in the strongest position in its history. I am very bullish and feel that the share price will surpass $60 in the short term, with much larger gains in the long term."
"Too fast to $51, no place to buy.Too bad"
I bought AA thinking copper is becoming too expensive and industries are looking for replacements especially automobiles industries. Aluminium has and will always be the ready alternative. AA will play a major role if the infrastructure bill goes forward and also to an alternative for copper. This is a winner for many years to come
How can there be no news article explaining how Alcoa drops over $8 in 5 days (near 20%) and $4.60 today alone?
Boom
"I have been looking forward to writing this article. Alcoa (AA) has been on my radar for many years, and I love the cyclical characteristics of this Pittsburgh, PA-based company. Especially after the company spun off Arconic (ARNC), it is even more interesting to focus on Alcoa as it is increasingly becoming a pure commodity play. That said, the just released Q4 earnings were bad. Earnings were down and well below consensus expectations. Nonetheless, I am sticking to my bullish call as the company's main problem was lower commodity prices. Just like its management, I expect the company to grow sales volumes starting in the first quarter of 2020 and expect capital gains after a very weak year of 2019. The economy is bad, but we are seeing signs of a recovery that should benefit cyclical companies like Alcoa."
AA up 40 percent from 2 weeks ago when StockTrader posted to short it at 17....what a genius
Analysts keep saying what a buy AA is. Problem is the Stock keeps falling. Its one day wonders are always followed up with big selling.
will it go up even more?
Congrats to the longs. Can’t wait to see $60.
Market cap expansion year for alcoa. 5bln to 30bln.
Bought 400 @ 48 a few years ago and happy to be almost above water…guess I will stick around a bit longer
This company knows how to screw up. It’ll never hold a good stock price. It’s built for trading not investing. Falls as fast and more often than it rises.
After paying down the debt Cash on hand left will be 1.65 - 0.5 = 1.15 Bil. and debt will be 2.34-0.5 =1.84 Bil
Wow AA up over 11% on the day. I just bought in yesterday. I’m tempted to just take the quick profit here.
Not sure why this drops almost 7% on great news with plant reopening and aluminum prices soaring..
"Aluminum futures up again over 3% (!) I have a feeling this is going to bust back over $50 after ER, especially with that lame shakedown attempt last week."

"I am looking for some help in understanding the relationship and assets of Alumina (AWC) and Alcoa and AWAC from somebody more knowledgeable than myself. So please help if you can.What I do understand is that;AWAC is a joint venture between AWC and Alcoa.AWC owns 40% of AWACAlcoa owns 60% of AWACAlcoa is the operations manager of AWACAWACs operations include bauxite mining and smelting around the world.AWAC is big with about 25% of the Alumina market.What I cannot find information on is;Does AWC have any assets or operations outside of AWAC.Does Alcoa have any assets or operations outside of AWAC.Does AWC derive all its income from AWAC via dividend payments from AWACDoes Alcoa derive all its income from AWACDoes Alcoa derive any income from sources external to AWAC.I have tried to answer this myself however the AWC, Alcoa and AWAC websites seem very vague on the details.My reason for trying to understand this is I am an AWC shareholder and have been for many years and it now makes up a good % of my portfolio yet I don't fully understand the above relationships. (Yes I know I should have understood this before buying AWC shares).in addition Alcoa has just announced excellent financial results and as a result their share price jumped 15% today on the back of an already good 12 months.So if these great results are as a result of good AWAC performance does it not mean AWC should soon announce the same great financial results.So if anyone can fill in some or all of my knowledge gaps on this subject I would be very appreciative.thanks in advanceMartin"
"Reports Q2 revenue $2.7B, consensus $2.76B. ""In the second quarter, our Aluminum segment rebounded despite weaker metal prices, and we reported a solid cash balance, even after sizeable cash outlays,"" said President and Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey. ""We also maintained strong operational performance across all of our businesses."""
Someone attempt to steal it?
"Manipulation, shakeout before the next leg up."
"AA highest level in 13 years is $100. Why Aluminum hit the highest level in 13 years, but AA is at midpoint?"
AA hasn't even recovered to where it was 3 years ago. It was more than twice its current price a few years earlier when aluminium use wasn't as extensive as now.
Alcoa is up 7.25% to 43.47
Looks like solid support at $20. Is that the bottom? Fundamentals still look good in AA IMO.
You would think the company would start buying back the $200M worth of shares at these depressed levels
"Very good earnings again, room to move higher!"
Go straight to 53.5 today.We are looking at $58 as target
why it is falling today? I should have sold at 50.
I could see $55 as a low probability level but hitting to $55.80 is really surprising. Very intense trading.
Does anyone know if the stock buyback program that was announced in 2019 is still active or has the buyback of shares been completed?
"the simple reason that the demand for aluminum will increase is, the fleet, which is becoming more and more electric, this car can be made lighter and that is where aluminum comes in handy"
"The news today reported there is light at the end of the tunnel for the chip shortage to come to an end. That is the only thing holding the automotive industry back from booming combined with the shift to EV electric vehicles where the batteries and the vehicle structures are most,y aluminum Alcoa is primed to soar in the next year. Buy it now or buy it at $100 your choice"
INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: In the 1800's aluminum was more precious than gold. today this is one of the most versatile metals on the planet. There will be an important and protected need to provide easy USA access to this vital resource in the future....

For what is worth... just spoke to my friend Broker at Morgan Stanley in West Palm Beach and he told me that many institutions are buying Alcoa. He is recommending it to his clients and they are accumulating it in the heavy side. They have it with a price target  of $23 - $25. No wonder why AA has gone from $7 to $12 in just two weeks. I am buying more tomorrow. Good luck to all the Longs !!
"Despite the short term pain of a plummeting share price, which has yet to find a bottom, the EPS estimate for this year is $0.85 and $2.47 for next year. This company has very little debt (almost all of the debt stayed with Arconic), and given all the cost cutting that they've done over the past 2 years to improve operating margins, I wouldn't be surprised if they blow through these estimates. Not trying to hype here. I think there will be more pain in the short term and this thing could slip below $20, but assuming that we don't slide into a major recession before the 2020 election, I'm looking for a major reversal to begin in Q3 of this year."
Crown Holdings build new beverage can plant in Nevada which means big increase in demand for food grade aluminum from Alcoa!
I am an optimist. I am looking at a total loss of a 55 Oct 15 Call if there is not a quick total rally. I am down 90% on this one. So I just Sold a 42 Put for the same expiration. It worked for $AA and I made 10$ from what would have been a 100% loss. The premium offsets the expected loss. We will see. The worst outcome is I keep the premium (Wash on the options) and I have 100 CPE shares @42.
"Aluminum producer Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) has been on an impressive win streak lately, up 1.1% at $41.17 today as shares charge back toward their May 10, two-year peak of $44.42. The 10-day moving average has also helped guide the equity higher, and year-to-date, AA is up 77%. Plus, there's evidence AA isn't done climbing just yet, with a historically bullish signal."
"What happened, does anyone know?"
$AA made me a fortune today!
Congrats to all! Aluminum is looking strong right now. CSTM is next!

"So what triggered this huge drop, this, on the heels of recent upgrades? Is their pending negative news?"
"Does anyone have any insight on where we're at in the aluminum commodity cycle? I pulled up the stock price chart and going back to 1/1/09, the average time span between peaks in the AA share price is 33 months. Here is some other interesting data showing extreme swings between the peaks and the troughs over the past 10 years. On 1/1/09 the stock was $17.64. Only 10 months later the stock traded at a high of $38.74 on 10/1/09. The next low point 7 months later was $24.16 on 4/1/10. It only took 10 months for the stock to rebound to a high of $42.44 on 1/1/11. The stock then continued on a steep downward trend and hit a low of $18.79 on 4/1/13. The stock then went back on a 16 months uptrend more than doubling to hit a high $38.66 on 7/1/14."

steel prices did fall. Will the carmaker use this expensive aluminium material?
It's unbelievable to see this drop from $22 to 13.92 in ONE month !!!! What is the driving force?
"This happened the quarter before last. The price was around $26.00 per share. After the earnings report the shares tanked all the way down to $18.00, then it climbed to a high of $44.00. This stock is being manipulated. I’d love to see the Reddit ape army grab on to this one!"

For me it is too risky to add at this level.

I went to their Deschambault facility today to approve new electrical equipments. Very impressive industrial installations. They will profit huge from the upcoming commodity supercycle and they know it... free lunch and non-alcoholic beer for everyone that day! hehe
Any insight or thoughts as to why Alcoa is underperforming as of late? Aside from Delta variant and Afghanistan.
The price of aluminum is up again today.
"Support, Risk & Stop-lossOn the downside, the stock finds support just below today's level from accumulated volume at $21.83 and $20.82. There is natural risk involved when a stock is testing a support level, since if this is broken, the stock then may fall to the next support level. In this case, Alcoa Inc finds support just below today's level at $21.83. If this is broken, then the next support from accumulated volume will be at $20.82 and $19.81.This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved $1.84 between high and low, or 8.24%. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of 6.02%."
"I sold out last week when it hit 50. Did you see the price action today. Up 1.75 and seconds later in the red. Then back into the green. Even if AA knocks earnings out of the park, who knows where it will go and for how long. Stay away."
Alcoa is up 7.53% to 52.26
strong buy.
"this company is one of the biggest Aluminum in the world, they produce alu 7075/6063 for shipyard, we bought a lot for our factory. with ev soaring. i think Aluminum will be higher next months. specially in May."
what's happen ?
"AA is clearly a momentum stock. The trend is your friend! By setting the record date of October 29th for the dividend, current holders are going to hang onto their shares at least until that data, and it will also bring in new buyers to catch the dividend, which will be paid in November. On top of that there is the half billion dollar stock buy back. There is only one direction for this stock and that is up!"
$52 is a trap. Don't bite. Wait for $45.

why the 5% drop today?
Very high risk at $52. Why would you buy at the peak? Buy back is indicative of some softening.
"with all its ups and downs aa hasnt gone anywhere since 1998 .... it is a traders stock. not for long term investors. unless things have somehow magically changed. i need to see a steady dividend payout before i would put any money in a company like aa .... it looks like a good trade here, but take your profits and run after it rallies further -"
Aluminum up 1.4% today
analysts expect an increase of 30 % more to aluminium for next year
"AA is a great company, but $52 is too fast too high. It's most likely a trap for retail investors. AA should be at this PPS in 6-12 months assuming the Al price remains high. It may hit $53-55 depending on the trader's game but the stock will see $45-42 before resuming uptrend. Short term short on this."
"Options market says the big boys are betting large on AA being 21 by mid-April (5,5% from here) and 25 by mid July (25% from here) so I'm thinking AA is a BUY BUY BUY"
Looks to open today at a new 52 week high . Very bullish trend as aluminum continues to rocket upward .
Anyone watching on the sidelines is going to miss the ride. Price of aluminum skyrocketing faster than private space ride tickets. AA in the low/mid 70’s the next six months.

Given that magnesium is a key alloying ingredient to autosheet, cansheet and common alloy; conversion prices are expected to shoulder the increases. Typical 5xxx alloys contain between 2.5% to nearly 5.0% of magnesium; lower levels in 5052 and increasing levels in 5083, 5754 and 5182."

Anyone has any news why AA shares keep dropping for the last few days?
Why AA - Alcoa Corporation stock jumped today? Source: https://prem.li/StockMarketToday
"I can see a lot of bears but earnings stand at approx $1.5 for the quarter. This extrapolates to $6.0 for the year implying a $90 price for the stock at a 15 P/E. Conservatively if we assume only 50% chance for this to be a sustainable trend, the stock price should go to $45-50. Why metal prices would go down at the beginning of an economic cycle? Most electric cars, that are megatrend, want Al. My bet is that this will go to $50 over one year and to $40 over the next 2 weeks, once the short term games are exhausted."
"Let's look at some of the indicators:50-day moving average, just crossed below that and it looks like it likes to hover around the 50 day MA.200-day moving average - we remain well above that and has been well above it since November. RSI - 41: so approaching oversold but not quite there. MACD is droppingThere is no crossing of the Moving Averages happening anytime soon. But with the infrastructure bill moving nicely, aluminum prices high, China cutting back on exports, and broad economic growth, I'm very comfortable buying more at this point."
Anyone see this going to $60 or so mark?
I bought Alcoa years ago before their split into Arconic- I subsequently held my Alcoa shares for several years after the split until I was able to sell them in 2017 at $40 which I was happy about since this was my break-even point and was glad to get out-within 6 months the price ran up to $65-moral of the story: don't try to figure out the price action on this stock
"sold today 16.51 held this since 7, looking at shorting...any thoughts?"
Any predictions on how low this drops?
"(RTTNews) - Below are the earnings highlights for Alcoa Corp.

What do you thing about the earnings today?
"I started buying in February thinking it was underpriced then. Even went so far as to sell $15 calls. AA is also my largest single position, occupying around 15% of my portfolio (now, and Q1 2020). You get big returns by concentrating, but lower risk by diversifying. Thankfully a big bet on AA has been paying off, even though seeing $6 was difficult.I luckily started the year with a lot of cash and a plan to buy solid value companies with good management. Watching some Tech skyrocket had me suffering from mild FOMO, but most of my own choices have recently been coming back strong. Thanks AA, for the validation. Unfortunately I used up my cash too quick to take advantage of the $6 back then but I'm satisfied."
TOTAL MANIPULATION
Any reason Alcoa drop so much today?
"Sold my AA in August at $14.50 ... moved to TCNNF with a 10% of my portfolio position in MMNNF. Made $1.3 million since then while Alcoa went down. ACB was up 40% yesterday. But, if Alcoa returns to $6, I'm all in! Thanks for the elevator ride Alcoa!"

"Don't sell , hold on, AA just like girl friend, need waiting forever, when you married, you will get the good result in the end"
"With the redemption of 500M in debt, AA will only have 1.8B in debt. 1.65B in cash on hand. I would bet the dividend will be reinstated to attract more institutional investors and to signal their financial strength. Don't forget, AA is a bellwether stock"

"IMO this belongs right back where it was before earnings. That would be funny to see it reach that target in the next two weeks. I would have thought the Rusal sanctions data was already baked into the price prior to earnings, however, I guess not. The revised guidance did nothing but make the $48 price, prior to the selloff, more of a reasonable valuation. At a $41ish price, this stock is trading as if aluminum was $1700 a ton not, $2050. Congrats shorts on your push, and congrats to those who bought in around the $40’s. $6-$7 higher within the next few weeks (maybe sooner). Anyone have an update on Rusal and sanctions data. Last I heard, Deripaska hadn’t stepped down yet. So September could have fireworks, unless the administration would like to bend the knee again."
Any predictions on what this opens at tomorrow morning?
"My lot in life,,, company x reports bad news the stock falls,,, buy company y (AA) and they report good news and beat estimates and they fall..."
"From MF article and I couldn't agree more: ""Needless to say, investors are worried now that metal prices are showing signs of cooling down, and that's weighing down the stock price. That said, Alcoa is on a stronger footing now, and it might be too early to suggest the commodity upcycle is coming to an end. It's a wait-and-watch situation for now.""Like I said before, check the current spot pricing for AL. still holding strong at all time highs.Today was just a pull down with other miners"
"CEO Harvey says rather than tariffs, the Trump administration needs to provide incentives for producers to restart and create new capacity, cooperate with allies to eliminate unfair subsidies abroad, and support investments in research and development of smelting technology.

"Only behalf of my brother/sisters Alcoans....thank you for the 10c dividends and 500m stock buyback !!! +50, +60, +70..."
"I'm buying heading into earnings. I know this is kind of a dog in the steel sector, but you have to like the positive tailwinds with the Bidenfrastructure plans.. another competitor I'm long on (NUE) expecting a massive beat next ER, I expect good things here too, it's not as volatile or fun as X and CLF but I prefer steady and undervalued plays with market so bubbly."
Alcoa reached a 52 Week high at 53.00
any thoughts of when AA pays a dividend or special dividend?
"guy I got in at 40.5 and had more than 800 shares . it would a significant loss , Amy tips here ?"
"The demand for aluminum is skyrocketing. The major user auto manufacturing has been idled because of computer chip shortage. Tesla, Ford, GM and others are building new battery plants to power EV and battery casing is aluminum, EV cars structure are using aluminum. All big players are building new EV car and truck plants that will use aluminum. Beverage can manufacturer is building massive plant in Nevada using all aluminum can. The major aluminum producer China is drastically curtailing production because of environmental impact from old plants without today’s pollution control equipment. Federal government is going to offer huge rebate money for EV cars/trucks As auto industry wakes up, as EVs and EV battery demand skyrocket with China production reduced Alcoa is going to run full throttle to keep up with demand the stock will soar in the coming year."
"My West Palm Beach friend broker that works for Morgan Stanley told me to stay away from Alcoa because it’s overbought. I told him that I had a very big short position, and he told me that I would make money because Alcoa has gone up to fast on misc news. “The first lesson taught to new traders and analysis with the RSI is how to trade the overbought and oversold levels. New traders and analysts are taught that when the RSI reaches 70 or higher, it is an opportunity to scale out of a long position or consider a short position.If the RSI drops to 30 or lower, then it is an opportunity to cover a short position or open a long position. It’s important to understand that the RSI was designed at a time when markets were very much range-bound. “This climb up has to stop  on Monday !!"
"The spot price has risen quickly, useage shoud drop off for the next few months, and now the spot price is high enough to start recommissioning the closed manufacturing plants. Intraday and 5 day charts both look very top heavy to me. The big question is “how much room is there from here to make a profit?” Not much"
I see Citicorp reduced it's target price from $53 to $33 today-how can they possibly have any future credibility with an estimate this far off????
"Amazing stock and a big thank you to China for creating a decade worth of sustainable demand for Alcoa. This is essentially an undervalued growth stock that has underperformed the market since 2018. Amazing set-up right here, look for it to trade down to somewhere between 33-34 and if it dips into the 32s even better, because I'm going to buy a whole lot more."
"Aluminium, the new copper. Im in"
"Aluminum prices rose to a near 9.5 yr high on ""yesterday"" 3/3/21, caused by concerns of supply cuts in China, the world’s biggest user and producer of the metal."
Let’s go back to $40+
"Just curious what happens when prices eventually correct to historical norms. Alcoa Corp. AA, -1.71% said late Thursday it reached record earnings and per-share profit in the second quarter as its aluminum prices rose more than 60% year-on-year."
Anybody know why this is still dropping?
"inventories steadily declining, more auto manufacturers going to light weight materials, aluminum hitting 1.32 a pound today , all looks great. liking cenx as well, they are well below their 52 wk highs. glta"
Stock is poised to break through $60 with a good Q3 report.
Why AA drop so much today? any bad news on the company?
Potential break out level again either 60 or back to 35.
Sold at 44 today with 10% profit. I will move on next investment. Thanks AAMost likely it will go up further. Good luck to longs.
over $54 td
who was the guy yesterday telling everyone to sell? this is rocket fuel
"At Last, closing above 40. Still looking for the 50's by the end of summer."
Any ideas on what is driving the share price up? Are investors expecting a beat on earnings tomorrow?
"Hmm...the name of the game today is push lower and lower and lower....I've been through this before. ""Market mobs"" are likely trying to wipe out as many as possible and position for a gap up on Mon when they will sell back to some of you at 2-5% premium. Besides this is the 4th day of negative with a huge push downwards on positive earning news. I don't know to what level this will be driven today, maybe to 32.50 or even 32.00? I will accumulate and report the avg price at the end of the day and then will see on Mon where we are. Tough game but nerves of steel and confidence in high Al prices being here for longer, will prevail. Good luck to everyone!"
"today is up, tomorrow will be down again."
"Earnings are out, very good, not much movement AH. Conference call at 4:00 pm."
Aluminium futures nov 2.25% down still highest ever….no sweat for AA slowly but steady up!
Break $50 already!
"Predicting BLOW OUT earnings!!!!! and the possibility of a special or regular divy?all while aluminum continues it's parabolic rise. loving it!10/08/2021 AluminiumCommodity2,945.65+48.35+1.67%09:09:38 AMMI Indication"
Interesting reaction to story about Chinese dumping on the market. Recent story about tariffs on Chinese Aluminum? Interesting.
18 more minutes left in after hours trade and people are selling on the earnings news.
This stock can easily double
"Alcoa is a company carrying $2.7 billion in debt currently. Apply the $670 million Alcoa will receive from the Kaiser deal, and that number could come down to just $2 billion -- only a bit more than the $1.7 billion in cash Alcoa has on hand. Result: Net net, Alcoa could emerge from this deal very close to net debt free, a prospect that should obviously please its shareholders.Combine this with the likelihood that any U.S. national infrastructure program that benefits steelmakers like U.S. Steel will almost certainly benefit aluminum producers like Alcoa, and it becomes clear why all of these stocks are enjoying a bull run today."
"YF hasn't updated the revised eps for this quarter which is $1.51. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $-1.17, so AA has really turned it around. Check out the OI and volume on the Oct 15 calls (ER Oct 13). Yesterday was a prime example of institutional manipulation. I think we should get a nice bump back back over 50+ with strong results. I'm also long STLC.TO which has even better margins and EPS than Alcoa."
Just wow !
