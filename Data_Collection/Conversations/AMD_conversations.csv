"I agree. 8 November is a $100M incentive to close the merger. Plus as we have discussed a PPS punch up is enabled by staging the merger. Dr Lisa Su will be strategic and announce the merger after Earnings before 8 November.Strategic Announcement Sequencing for Earnings and M&A Announcements is based on how well your company is performing. Studies have shown that acquiring companies are more likely to announce earnings before mergers announcements if their earnings meet analyst expectations, especially if the acquiring company plans to use stock as a full or partial method of payment. This “merger announcement second” strategy works exceptionally well for companies like AMD with very favorable earnings profiles. Announcing merger after the Earnings creates a more positive news environment and generates higher abnormal returns.So AMD has not only the ability, AMD has an incentive to alter the sequence of Earnings and Merger announcements to optimize the market’s perception of AMD/Xilinx.The strategic merger announcement would come after the Earnings call. This aligns well with the Dividend 8 November deadline. It seems others have noticed 8 November as well.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4463523-amd-to-wrap-up-xilinx-xlnx-acquisition-quickly?mail_subject=amd-100-million-plus-one-reasons-for-amd-to-wrap-up-xilinx-acquisition-quickly&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha"

"No one has commented about how healthy the AMD/XLNX balance sheet will be after the merger. AMD currently has effectively no long term debt, and XLNX is carrying less than $2B. Their combined cash and short term investments will be over $7B, plus nearly $1.5B more in receivables than they have in payables. They could pay off all long term debt and still have $6B in the bank for working capital, to strategically invest in product development, and perhaps for share buybacks or dividend payments. It's looking very healthy in contrast to just a few years ago, making AMD even more attractive for institutional holders. There is just no reason to sell for the foreseeable future. GLTA."
"Yahoo Finance sees 37% upside. Their words on how they come to that estimate:""Fair Value is the appropriate price for the shares of a company, based on its earnings and growth rate also interpreted as when P/E Ratio = Growth Rate. Estimated return represents the projected annual return you might expect after purchasing shares in the company and holding them over the default time horizon of 5 years, based on the EPS growth rate that we have projected."""
"In addition to all the great performance progress, from the quarterly call we learned two great things about the AMD Xilinx merger. The merger regulatory work is essentially complete and AMD/Xilinx are locked and loaded with joint product sets. AMD/Xilinx are ready to hit the ground running in the next 6 weeks.First, Dr Lisa said that AMD has absolutely no problem with China regulatory issues. And that although Intel is having troubles in China, AMD sales in China are great. AMD has essentially completed what is needed for regulatory approval. Dr Lisa Su took the position that the merger actions remaining are perfunctory and closing will be sometime in the next 6 weeks.Second, Dr Lisa Su said that independent of the merger paperwork AMD and Xilinx have been diligently working together. They had already completed a lot of the work needed to operate as one company. This includes administration, marketing and the technology joint progress. Subsequently in her interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC Dr Lisa Su elaborated on this. She said that they had already laid plans to mine the Xilinx customer base & TAM. AMD/Xilinx already have joint adaptive computing, AI, wired and wireless communications, industrial, and automotive solutions. And in the final question from Timothy Acuri of UBS Dr Lisa Su responded that she is specifically pleased that the Xilinx/AMD software team has provided them such a great boost in capabilities."
"AMD price target raised to $145 from $130 at Susquehanna, BUYAMD price target raised to $145 from $120 at Wells Fargo, overweightAMD price target raised to $140 from $110 at Raymond James, outperformRaymond James analyst Chris Caso raised the firm's price target on AMD to $140 from $110 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. AMD's (AMD) report once again demonstrated a marked contrast with Intel's (INTC) report, demonstrating strong share gains, Caso tells investors in a research note. The analyst estimates AMD has now gained 6 points of server share since earlier this year, and AMD is not experiencing the China weakness Intel mentioned on their call, he says."

"the day after er amd stock dropped 6 bucks almost instantaneously coinciding with intels alder lake spec reveal.now, after the dust settled it turns out that alder lake will not be the halo product that intel wants us to believe:- much higher power consumption than ryzen 5000 - unnecessarily complex design for little more total efficiency, covering the fact that big.little is a necessity for intel, not for consumers. otherwise intel couldnt have fit as many cores on 1 die without running out of space/destroying yields- shady benchmarks exploiting win11 bug of high cache latencies on amd ryzen in comparison (see charlie, semiaccurate)- first glimpses, that alder lake wont beat ryzen 5000 series in multicore performance (intel was very coy about it)- alder lake will be at best 15% faster in games, despite/even with all of the above - one year later- high cost of platform purchase/change, requiring expensive ddr5 memory to stay competitive- win11 required to even extract the promised performance- intel still cant sell those cheap, yields wont be all too pretty compared to amds chiplet approachall in all it seems to me alder lake is a lukewarm catch up to a 1 year old product. Zen3 with 3D cache will provide parity or even leadership again at much higher energy efficiency and platform cost. existing amd users can just flip the cpu.Question : Where are our 6 bucks?"
"Xilinx shareholders get a dividend as long as the deal does not close by November 8thOne would think that this will accelerate XLNX sales going into November 8th“As permitted as of October 27, 2021 under the terms of the Merger Agreement between Xilinx and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), the Xilinx Board of Directors voted unanimously to declare a cash dividend of $0.37 per outstanding share of common stock payable on November 15, 2021 to all stockholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2021. The dividend is conditioned upon and will only be payable if the merger has not closed on or before the record date for such dividend.Xilinx’s stock repurchase program remains suspended. The parties believe that the transaction remains on-track for regulatory approval and close by calendar year end.”https://investor.xilinx.com/node/18856/pdf"
"Anything posted on this board at this point is pure speculation and a guessing game. Every long, and even every short, thought AMD would have gone to $130 post earnings when the details were announced. Instead, AMD tanked post earnings to the low $120s. Now it appears to be stuck there, and will most likely drift lower, with occasional good days, until January when they announce earnings again. Yes, the Xilinx merger could make the price move (if the merger is approved, and there is no guarantee of that), but maybe wall st already has that baked into the current price. Full disclosure, I’m a long since $10.28, and I have seen how these things go with AMD. It’s just incredibly frustrating to see all other companies continue to go up post great earnings, and yet AMD always seems to go down for weeks post great earnings. There’s no rhyme or reason with AMD, and I know I am not alone in these frustrations. I’m not selling, as I think the next 6-9 months should be ok. Again, just frustrated. "
AMD will be upgraded with several analysis posting their increased numbers in the morning! IMHO - AMD is worth at least 1/2 of Nvidia market cap. November 8th should be a incredible presentation.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-epyc-instinct-data-center-3d-vcache
"@DeMannequin, picking up our conversation from last week... I listened to the conference call, and unless I missed it there was no mention of Exynos. Q4 GM is projected to be about 1% higher than Q3, but Devinder attributed that to increased datacenter sales. No mention of royalties. Here's the quote from the transcript on SeekingAlpha:""Yeah, so Q4, it is up slightly puts on a guidance one point from Q3. And that's really product mix, higher margin from server offset by Semi-Custom revenue also being higher going from Q3 to Q4. So very pleased with the progress in the gross margin as you look at the Q3, results up 440 basis points from last year, up 80 basis points last quarter. And the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the server, our revenue growing is very pleased with that also.""Maybe they are already factoring in some revenue from Exynos, but if that is the case, they refused to mention it, as I said would happen. Personally, I doubt that it is even factored into the margin outlook. If it is, a gain of only 1% in GM would be roughly $45M. That's a lot less than I would expect in royalties from a quarter's worth of Exynos production--and you would have to factor out the portion of margin expansion from datacenter growth, leaving perhaps a few million in Exynos revenue. No, I think it is not even modeled in the Q4 outlook.Perhaps that is partly why Lisa Su really did not want to get into any specific numbers for FY2022 yet--she does not feel at liberty to mention expected revenue from Samsung/Exynos until the product has been announced. Also, they are holding off for the completion of the Xilinx acquisition. Once those two events are in place, I think at the Q4 earnings conference call we will find out that revenue for 2022 will be at least $25B, with gross margins around 55%--assuming the Xilinx merger is completed."
AMD stock price target raised to $150 from $135 at BofA Securities
New price target from Hans as you may have already seen. $150 to $180. Hans is calling this a David vs Goliath narrative that will resonate in Silicon Valley for years to come. He further says that he sees years of significant sales growth and margin expansion. Finally...he says that the Street is just starting to acknowledge the disruptive and sustainable impact AMD is having on the x86 market. It is a top 3 pick for Hans.

Weraise our '21 EPS estimate to $2.62 from $2.34 and '22's to $3.28 from $2.87.AMD posts Q3 EPS of $0.75 vs. $0.32, beating the $0.66 consensus. Sales rose54%, better than expected, on higher demand in Computing and Graphics (up 44%)as well as Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (up 69%). Gross margin expanded400 basis points to 48%, wider than we thought, aided by better product mix. Webelieve that AMD is taking considerable share in the data center (revenue morethan doubled YoY), driven by greater adoption of its 3rd Gen EPYC processors bycloud service providers and higher enterprise spending. We believe AMD isnavigating current supply constraints well, while we are optimistic aboutprospects for its next generation CPUs and GPUs. We positively view AMD'simproving financial position, with net cash of $3.3B and FCF of $764M ($265M ayear ago)."

"RAYJAY DOES AN AMD VS INTEL COMPARISON:AMD's report once again demonstrated a marked contrast with Intel's report, demonstrating strong share gains, Caso said.
