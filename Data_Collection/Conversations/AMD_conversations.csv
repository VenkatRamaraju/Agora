"RE: AMD stock buyback, $4Billion on, I believe May 19th (much, much before most companies and 1st for AMD since 2001/due to AMD's good financials,....: ""Yahoo FinanceCompanies are stepping back into the market: Morning BriefMyles UdlandMyles Udland·AnchorThu, August 26, 2021, 4:05 AMIn this article:This article first appeared in the Morning Brief. Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET. SubscribeThursday, August 26, 2021Buybacks are making a comebackIn the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the biggest sources of buying power in the stock market were the companies themselves. At the post-crisis buyback peak of March 2018, members of the S&P 500 had spent a collective $823.2 billion repurchasing shares of their own company over the prior 12 months, a pace of more than $200 billion per quarter. During the second quarter of last year, in contrast, S&P 500 members spent a mere $88.7 billion repurchasing their shares. But as the economy has improved, the stock market has rallied, and management teams can reward shareholders rather than hunker down to survive a recession, corporate buyers have returned as a force in the stock market. Data from Bank of America Global Research published Tuesday showed that last week corporations spent the most repurchasing their own shares in more than five months.""Buybacks by corporate clients accelerated from the prior week to the highest level since mid-March, driven by Financials,"" the firm said in a note to clients. ""Financials has now overtaken Tech as the sector with the largest dollar amount buybacks so far this year."""""

"Who would trust $INTC to keep any of their commitments? Cannon Lake, the first 10nm CPU was 3 years late. The US government just had to contract with HPE/NVDA and AMD to deliver a supercomputer called Polaris because INTC failed to deliver CPUs for Aurora as promised. They're over 3 years late so far: ""Aurora was first announced in 2015 and to be finished in 2018. It was expected to have a speed of 180 petaFLOPS[5] which would be around the speed of Summit. Aurora was meant to be the most powerful supercomputer at the time of its launch and to be built by Cray with Intel processors. Later, in 2017, Intel announced that Aurora would be delayed to 2021 but scaled up to 1 exaFLOP. In October 2020, DOE said that Aurora would be delayed again for a further 6 months and would no longer be the first exascale computer in the US.[6]"""

Worried shorts posting at a record pace! So funny!!
14 dollar very near term upside after short consolidation..Let's go AMD
"A very good opportunity to buy an exceptionally well managed company, in the growing digital arena at a below value price, I feel so lucky to own shares in this amazing company, with a fantastic, positive company culture too on the leading edge of chip innovation. AMD can attract the most innovative, creative, skilled engineers, HR folks, everyone....in this labor shortage this is a key factor to consider. I think AMD would also be a great company to work for to. A significant limiting factor to growth for tech companies is being able to attract and retain motivated, skilled, talented team members. AMD can do this, people are excited about working at AMD and like the management's direction, they are all true techies at heart."
It has been only a matter of time before it breaks out and climbs the charts!
Weekend surprise... China approves AMD $XLNX merger.

""We are delighted to continue this collaboration with Samsung as we help to evaluate HBM-PIM systems for their potential to achieve major performance and energy-efficiency gains in AI applications."""
Both AMD and XLNX gained in the after market hours trading. Looking good for tomorrow Longs! All the best to us! The shorts have to be getting nervous......
"If it closes above 111, we are likely go back up to the all time high....Longs, you have a great weekend. Good Luck friends...Thank you Dr. Su"
"Just buy and Hold! No News, just noise from analyst that did not bought in before. DO NOt Let them shake you out of AMD.From a guy that has been in the Semiconductor Business for over 30 years:1) AMD has the Process2) AMD has the Roadmap3) AMD has the merger to make it more dynamic4) AMD has YOY Earnings and Revenue Growth to back it up and is not letting up anytime soon!Now where can you find another semiconductor stock that firing on ALL CYLINDERS."
AMD/XLINX APPROVAL!
Wake me when we are at a $200B market cap without any sort of stock buyback. That's when I know Wall Street is actually doing their job.
Doing well vs the Nasdaq today and for the most part holding our gains to $108ish on a RED. Bullish signs! Go AMD! Go Longs!
"Interesting to see that AMD revenue grew at 99% vs 68% for Nvdia in Q2 YoY ( 1 month difference as AMD Q2 ends in June and Nvidia in July) while the Nvidia market cap is 2.5 times AMD on a price / revenue basis. At one time investors should recognize the valuation gap and push AMD much higher. Furthermore, AMD has probably been more capacity constrained than Nvidia as all their FABs are now with TSMC while Nvidia diversified with Samsung."
We expect an intense short squeeze after AMD XLNX merger approval
"Hmm, what to do with that extra $11,000 that my wife didn’t need for her new car from the sale of shares at $120. That’s right, going to buy back shares at a discount. Thank you AMD!"
"Ahhhh...still celebrating the $100 breakout. Bringing out more whiskey & rum as we now toast the $110 breakout. I'm sure the high school kids (that most of us have MUTED) are still here saying ""$50 before $100""? They only want to be the class clowns. Have a great investment day!"

"@Kris I don't understand your concern about ""messing up"" by selling AMD and buying XLNX in an IRA. You ALWAYS have to pay taxes when withdrawing money from an IRA. The nice thing is your money grows tax-free until you withdraw it. If you sold AMD to flip XLNX in a regular brokerage account, you'd have to pay taxes on the sale NOW. So why do you think it's bad to flip stocks in an IRA? Please explain, as I'm doing this now."
"Here are quotes from Dr Lisa Su taken by Ryan Shrout in an interview nearly 4 years ago. “As Su passes her three-year anniversary as CEO this month, the turnaround that she has overseen is drastic and covers nearly every aspect of the product families and IP portfolio that AMD holds.Su told me that if AMD can continue to grow at an above-average rate compared with the rest of the market, she “can return this company to making a lot of money.”It’s clear that investors still have doubts, and they will demand to see multiple quarters of execution.“That’s our job to prove,” Su said.So what do you say? Has Dr Lisa Su accomplished what she set out to prove?"
"So, I'm guessing the Maxim approval means China regulators can now focus their attention on the Xilinx merger? Or are getting closer to doing that?"
"Take a look at the oscillators AO, MACD, RSI. 1H needed to be cooled, 4H and 1D are strong longs. There will be growth tomorrow."
"If you think you can out smart Wall St. crooks by playing the merger with XLNX, think twice! If you bought XLNX @$140, good luck with the jump today, as similar as most of other stocks like oil. It could be nothing to do with the merger! If you want to add some XLNX, fine, but don't sell your AMD, the real treasurer!"
Welcome aboard new Longs. On board the train to the $150 station and beyond. AMEN>
I really get excited seeing NVDA gain even more than us today knowing we are growing faster than they are! Our catch up trade has plenty left in the tank when NVDA is up 68% YTD and we’re only up 18% YTD! We are a screaming buy right now and someone is going to eventually do this same math and buy all that they can get their hands on!
AMD has :1) The Process2) New Innovations3) Tremendous YOY Revenue and Earnings Increase4) Of Course Lisa Su and The RoadmapNot to mention Plenty of Cash !It will go the way of NVDA and FTNT which I started to invest in when they were both in the 30sand now look at them- WOW !Trust the process!
This quarter AMD takes the laptop market from $NVDA.
It looks to me like AMD is heading for a new ATH--maybe within 2-3 weeks. Anyone agree with me?

"Simply making powerful chips but no good support for AI/ML workloads will push customers to buy NVDA GPU's where Jensen is truly enjoying a high margins. Intel has proven record of OpenVINO adoption, they have demonstrated it with drones, embedded devices, networking devices. However bad Intel is today, they still have a good software stack which is the only threat to NVDA. AMD won't get chance to rise if it doesn't improve it's ROCm support. I still bet AMD to reach 160 by end of the year but that's the plateau. Xilinx deal is not something that elevates AMD to compete with NVDA. FPGA's are not easy to work with."
what did i tell ya'll close @ 111.40 or better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Are we done with the manipulation. On our way to the $150 station and beyond. MMs, shorties & fellow Longs, all enjoy the day and make money. AMEN>"
Crooks continue to manipulate AMD stock. They can’t do anything about AMDs continuous ability to innovate products that take market share from its competitors! Hold and rewards will result!
"Should be trading in the $160 Range. I see AMD Severely Undervalued compared to NVDA. At present based on EPS and PE’s of both companies and future growth put forward by both, I personally believe AMD should be commanding between 70-75% on NVDA’s share price. That would put AMD in the $160’s range. In all reality that is still low based on share count and NVDA beating by a Whopping 2c………………..ace"

"AMD IN A GOLDRUSH! AMD is bringing home the gold!Big money was made in the California Gold Rush (1848–1855). With a population of 160,000 in 1847 California swelled with the 300,000 people attracted by the lure of gold. But few of the 300,000 actually struck it rich with the $200M in gold that was pulled out of the earth during the rush. Most spent all they had and only got back breaking work for their trouble. Most lost out on a great opportunity.BUT! Riches were a sure thing for the people who were smart enough to be the provisioners, suppling the material, the picks and shovels and clothing needed by the seemingly never ending stream of dreamers who moved to California during the rush. California was propelled to statehood and smart investors like New York City Jewish emigrant Levi Strauss, who moved to San San Francisco in 1853 and made his emigrant family’s fortune with Levi’s jeans.This is exactly what we have today with AMD. Our society is changing profoundly. It’s our modern day gold rush. And the picks and shovels of today are semiconductors. Just look at a short list of what semiconductors are making possible.* Data centers* Smart phones.* Manufacturing Automation* Cloud computing* Cybersecurity * Space exploration* Video gaming* Online gambling* Augmented reality (AR)* Virtual reality (VR)* Mixed reality (MR)* Autonomous driving* Electric vehicles* Genomics* Esports * 5G* E-commerce* Cryptocurrency* Artificial intelligence (AI)* Metaverse* Big DataWhen you read this short list you see tremendous GROWTH! There are many plays on that growth. But the one pure and sure play is the AMD provisioning of semiconductors just as provisioning was the smart bet 168 years ago in California.AMD is our modern day gold rush pure play and one of the few companies that has the growth top end TAM head room, talent and superior management to bring home the gold!"
Stock is underpriced . That doesn’t keep hardcore shorts from trying to pull the rug out from under the stock price support though .

Many are worried that the price of graphics cards will rise to an extremely exaggerated level next month, and they are preparing to buy graphics cards. So is this news because profiteers spread rumors to sell graphics cards, or is it true?"

"Buy, accumulate, hold."
Yahoo does not discriminate between companies with respect to the Fair Value indicator on the Summary page. It is a straight forward formula(as I understand it). MSFT always seems to trade overvalued while the opposite can be said about AMD. AMD seems to always trade undervalued. Same can be said about NVDA. Always trades at overvalued. Can't explain it
"What is amazing about AMD is its revenue growth coupled with its earnings leverage. Revenue grew close to 100 % YoY and eps more than 300% in the last quarter. This is in a period where interest rates are close to zero which usually depicts very slow economic growth. AMD is entering a period where earnings and cash-flow will increase much more than revenue growth. If one assume that revenue will grow at 30-50% next year after growing at 60-70% this year, earnings could easily grow at 100%. Therefore AMD PEG ratio or PE/Growth is below 0.5 making AMD one of the cheapest growth stock in the market. As the market realize that AMD story is not only a market share gain story vs Intel but one of market share gain vs Nvidia (once the get more capacity at TSMC) and that AMD market share gains in servers is more sustainable then we could get a rerating and the stock move towards the 150$ level."

"Under US tax law a 1032 Reorganization is a tax free event. The AMD Xilinx merger is all stock and is declared by AMD as a “reorganization”. If this holds true your 1.7234 fixed exchange rate realized gain is not taxable. Do your Due Diligence on this. Brokerage houses often mess this up as they are not tax advisors. If the merger holds as a “reorganization” and not taxable under 1032 your broker could incorrectly allocate the event as taxable!Even worse is this. If you hold XLNX in a traditional IRA and the merger occurs you will pay taxes on the merger as ordinary income when you eventually withdraw from your IRA ! Yes! What would normally be tax free in a regular broker account, you would have to pay taxes upon the withdrawal from an IRA !Not fair...but true."

"The exciting fights between bears & bulls on AMD never stopped since Lisa Su became the CEO of AMD in 2014.""Winner takes it all"" in hightec market! Currently leaders in some areas are clear: AAPL in cell phone, GOOG in search engine, MSFT in window & office, AMZN in sales, FB in social media.. But at this moment, leaders for a few areas, such as cloud, 5G, AI, chips.., are still unclear? In chip sector, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG.. all wanted to get involved don't even mention about NVDA, INTC, Samsung etc. Who will be the winner(s)? Could AMD be one of them? In my view, with Lisa Su's leadership & AMD's road maps, there is a good chance for AMD! Especially if XLNX merger can be approved, all giant companies (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT,, GOOG..) will have to come to AMD for highend chips!And if that is the case, like Lisa Su said ""The best is yet to come""!Good luck all!"
"Re: 1SCShing-Ming ChenTo:Shing-Ming ChenFri 2021-08-27 8:52 AMTheoretically speaking, chances for winning and losing are always 50:50. But in some occasions, probabilities for winning or losing may be higher than 50%?For example, when 1-day STO of a stock 'starts turning around' from the over-bought (STO>=80) or over-sold zone (STO<=20), the probability for reversing the trend could be higher than 50%?This can be cross checked by examining the relationships between the history of a stock price vs its 1-day STO.Will this help the stock investment? To me, it is especially when the 'trend begins to turn'! But because there is still a possibility (25%?) it may go the other way, so always invest with risk controls! Looks like, this does apply to AMD (which has good fundamentals) very well. AMD came down from $122 about 3 weeks ago (STO around 90) to 102 last week (STO<20), now at $111 (STO around 50). It may continue to go up (75% chance) in the next few weeks or before Q3 report to test its ATH? Worth watching! Just somthing to share with my friends on this board (longs & shorts)! GLTA!"
"Early life and educationLisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in November[16][17] of 1969[9][2] in Tainan, Taiwan. She was born in a Taiwanese Hokkien speaking family.[18] She immigrated to the United States[2] at the age of 3 with her parents Su Chun-hwai (蘇春槐) and Sandy Lo (羅淑雅).[17][16] Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children.[19] When she was seven, her father – a retired statistician – began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.[2] At a young age, Su aspired to be an engineer, explaining ""I just had a great curiosity about how things worked"".[2] When she was 10, she began taking apart and then fixing her brother's remote control cars,[20] and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II.[21] She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.[8]Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering,[8] recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major.[2][19] During her freshman year she worked as an undergrad research assistant ""manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students""[20] through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, as well as her summer jobs at Analog Devices, fueled her interest in semiconductors.[8] She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education,[20] spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.[2] After earning her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, she obtained her master's degree from MIT in 1991.

"The AMD share buyback initiative was designed and implemented to preserve the merger.In October 2020 the AMD XLNX deal was struck at AMD $83 in a fixed exchange ratio of 1.7234 and a floating price with no cap, no floor and no collar. In May 2021, the Company announced a $4 billion share repurchase program. In the second quarter, the Company repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $256 million at an average price of $80.In the second quarter AMD ranged from $73 to $94. AMD buy back averaged at $80.Assertion: AMD pursued buyback up to $83 and stoped there as the AMD goal of merger preservation was reached.The entire purpose of the AMD buyback was to preserve the merger agreement and effect a floor at $83."

"AMD confirms that the CDNA2 architecture accelerator card will come out at the end of the year, 128GB memory is unprecedentedSource: Fast Technology 8/15/2021AMD’s GPU architecture also began to separate gaming and computing last year. Graphics cards now use RDNA2, and RDNA3 will be upgraded next year. The accelerator card uses CDNA. The first generation is the Instinct MI100 series. AMD confirmed that it will release the CDNA2 architecture accelerator card at the end of this year. In the AMD investor PPT updated in August, AMD updated the description of the accelerator card. Although the roadmap has not changed, AMD has added more descriptions on the CDNA2 architecture accelerator card and confirmed that it will be released before the end of this year.The accelerator card of the CDNA2 architecture is the Instinct MI200 series. AMD mentioned that it will start shipping not long ago. It should have been sampled for some customers and will be officially released before the end of this year.The design of CDNA2 is similar to RDNA3, that is, MCM multi-core packaging is adopted, and two Dies are integrated inside at the same time. The core size is easily doubled. It is estimated that there are 16384 stream processor cores in total, while MI100 has only 7680.In terms of video memory, MI100 is equipped with 32GB HBM2 with a bandwidth of up to 1.23TB/s, while MI200 will soar to 128GB, setting a new record, and it is upgraded to a new generation of HBM2e with a bandwidth of 2TB/s.As for performance, not counting the improvement in architecture, only MCM dual-core package, the performance of 15,000 stream processor units is almost doubled, MI100 FMA64/FP64 double precision performance is 11.5TFlops, FMA32/FP32 single precision is 23.1TFlops, MI200 is expected to be at least 20TFLOPS double-precision/40TFLOPS single-precision, and the performance is almost twice that of NVIDIA A100, at least on paper."

"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD is riding on robust performance from the Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segments. It is benefiting from strong sales of its Ryzen and EPYC server processors, owing to the increasing proliferation of AI and Machine Learning in industries like cloud gaming and the supercomputing domain.Moreover, the growing clout of 7-nanometer products in the data center vertical, driven by work-from-home and online learning trends, is a key catalyst. Management raised its 2021 guidance for revenues and gross margin on the back of strong growth across all businesses.The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 93.8% for the current year.

AMD manufacturing capacity and revenue are both set to increase 60% this quarter. Such a coincidence. Q4 may be better because $AAPL makes the transition from 5nm to 3nm leaving 5nm open for AMD.

Closing PPS ratio between Xilinx and AMD's PPS is 1.526 ... surprisingly it is lower than before the UK approval that was as high as 1.58.

Lisa Su had a higher ranking (among all CEOs) than NVDA, Google, etc..., You could read Fortune magazine. She was ranked #2 form a list of several thousands. Three CEOs came to Apple and ruined Apple., but one came after and fixed the ruined Apple, and Apple went to the sky, just by one CEO. The same is true for AMD, AMD should have been over hundred billion dollar company a long time ago. now, AMD is in the sky, all because of this intelligent and capable lady. Lisa Su has opened the door for future woman Steve Jobs."

"For anyone who may think that XLNX is any kind of a risk whatsoever, simply compare XLNX's historical performance against AMD's since Sept 1, 1990, since that is the earliest data that Yahoo has for XLNX:XLNX: $1.06 - $156.27AMD: $2.19 - $111.40What a blessing everyone has been given to gain more AMD shares in exchange for their XLNX shares upon the finalization of AMD's acquisition of Xilinx! I don't know this to be factual, but I can imagine that Dr. Lisa Su had to give her approval of this action. Since I believe she's the best CEO around, I have no qualms whatsoever in adding Xilinx to my portfolio. Best regards to all who agree and are, therefore, taking advantage of this rare and wonderful opportunity we've been given."

Shorties will lose! AMD always prevails!
"The more NVDA goes up, the more confident I am in AMD going to $200 in a fairly short amount of time."
AMD stock price doubles every year. This year the price is a little behind but making enough progress to make hash of the arb positions. Expect another solid pop. You never know when.
"We gained $6.75 for last week. It was a volitile week but a gain is a gain. I think we will be up more by Frida's close. The catalysts going forward are the completion of the XLNX merger, the launch of the Samsung/AMD RDNA Exynos chips, the launch of the Zen3 Vcatch refresh and a blow out q3 earnings report."
We shall finally see that $115 today as we've expected for some time now.
"i am not selling a single share friends. Just play in your daytrader zone. I am happy in my Zone. Again, not a Single Share.."
"YuP, Just as I suspected. AMD is bouncing Hard. Look for AMD to be around $115 to $120 range in the near future and Pop towards $130-$150 in the next several months ahead.1) Shortage of chips will make AMD Chip pricing upward2) AMD process is leaving INTC in the Dust3) Growth YOY Revenue and Earnings is HOT"
Just keep adding my friends when 150 comes or 290 by EOY you LL be glad you did

"I don't know why anyone would short AMD, with expected ongoing top and bottom line growth well into 2025 and onward. I have shorted companies but only those with projected declining top and bottom line growth, growing debt to equity ratios, in twilight sectors ect..., The digital arena is accelerating in growth CPUS/GPUS are the hubs of anything digital from medical devices to our laptops. AMD's products are just going to continue to grow in demand, there is no reasonable case to short AMD. Very long well into the future."

cup and handle chart for AMD = BULLISH = Going UP! Great stock. Long and strong.
"Barron::::n a recent interview, Su discussedBut we’re certainly bringing on more capacity every quarter, so you’ll see morThe technology business is about making big bets. Xilinx is a big bet for AMD. We believe that when you look at computing over the next five plus years, Xilinx is the number one player in adaptive computing and programmable chips. We think that is very complementary to the central processing unit and graphics processing unit technology that we have. We believe in this world—where you need all different types of computing. Xilinx also has a very strong presence in some of the markets that AMD isn’t in. When you combine the two together, you have a great set of technology, as well as a great set of marketse output every quarter for sure."
"When will AMD XILINX deal close? Here is how, when & why I think it will be very soon.At the close of trading AMD will give notice and NASDAQ will immediately halt trading. Unlike the NYSE and other SROs the NASDAQ (that trades AMD) has recently modified its policy and will look to halt after-hours trading of the acquired security the night prior to effectiveness. NASDAQ will resume trading for the opening bell if the merger doesn’t occur. If the merger does become effective, they will suspend trading and the acquired shares will not be allowed to trade.As far as the agreement conditions to close, the long pole in the tent is regulatory approval. If the merger has been delayed by China from their expected closing timeline, when they do approve AMD will be pressed to file their articles or certificate of merger immediately, depending on what the state will allow. But Dr Lisa Su cannot lose sight of other important issues.As an example companies are also required to file their financial statements (SEC Form 10-K or 10-Q) within a certain time frame after the company’s previous quarter has ended. And since closing is complete this effort is now doubled with AMD reporting for both Xilinx and AMD quarters.Although a company is no longer deemed to be a public company after effectively filing to close their merger and their shares are no longer traded in the public market, the deregistration process with the SEC is not so immediate.It can take an additional 10 days for this SEC process to be finalized after the exchange or SRO has completed their delisting confirmation filing, usually in the form (SEC Form-25).I think Dr Lisa Su will seek to avoid the cost associated with the preparation and filing of multiple Q3 financials. So I believe she will focus on closing the merger transaction as early as possible, creating more assurance that Xilinx will not be obligated to file in Q3. Or if China drags its feet, keeping Q3 reporting for Xilinx at a minimum.In other words I think the time is now."
"Shorties wouldn't a good strategy be to cover and ride the elevator up over the weekend. I hate to see you guys get wrecked by China's decision to approve the merger which is coming sooner than we all may think. The current range is about to be blown away and your dreams of a share price below 100 is about to be gone. Do yourselves a favor and concentrate on the next level. I know you don't want to do the longs any favors, but it's going to happen anyway. So hop on board the AMD Express before you're subjected to the duress of the upside that's sure to come! GLTA Especially the AMD longs!"
"How many GPUs did AMD sell in Q2? Reading between the lines of the Jon Peddie Research report tells us.They estimate 123 million total GPUs sold in Q2. That includes both iGPUs and dGPUs. Quite a few PCs come with both, so they count as two. That's how they ended up with 17% more GPUs than CPUs sold during the quarter.Looking at it another way, every laptop chip includes an iGPU, so if they also have a dGPU, they come with two. Most Intel desktop CPUs also have an iGPU, and AMD's G-series desktop CPUs also have an iGPU, so those are all counted as part of the 123 million. That's why Intel is shown as having the lead in GPU sales.However, console sales are not counted in these numbers, so you could probably add almost 4 million to AMD's raw number and 4.5 million for Nvidia based on Switch sales.Sticking with Peddie's numbers, Nvidia sold a total of 18.7M GPUs in the quarter (15.23% of 123M), all of them being dGPUs, up from 16.9M in Q2 last year (18.84% of 89.8M). In other words, Nvidia had growth of 10.6% in YoY unit sales.At the same time, AMD sold a total of 20.3M GPUs in Q2 (16.48% of 123M), compared to 15.85M YoY (16.69% of 85.8M), for a growth rate of 28%. But keep in mind that AMD's numbers include all of its laptop CPUs and desktop G-series CPUs.Since all of Nvidia's GPUs are dGPUs, we can infer that AMD sold 3.8M dGPUs in Q2, down 10% from 4.2M YoY. That means AMD's laptop and G-series desktop sales increased 42% from 11.65M to 16.5M YoY. Clearly, with limited capacity at TSMC, AMD is prioritizing CPUs over GPUs. With all AMD dGPUs sold out, and scalper prices increasing, they could be selling more if they had more capacity, but probably the profits are better on server and client CPUs at the moment.Although Peddie is projecting compound annual growth of only 3.5% for the next 4 years, AMD is poised to win a growing share of the market as production capacity grows, so their current 80M GPUs per year rate could double or triple. All things considered, I'd say these numbers are very good for AMD, and they will only get better as additional capacity comes online."

"USA is trying to block Chinas acquisition of Magnachip Semiconductor Corp, which only supports our view that this is hardly an environment for USA or Chinese mergers. Unfortunately we had more information to share on this, but clearly some here do not wish for investors to know."
Every Dip in the market (AMD is the market) is a buying opportunity. The over all market does not understand the technology so AMD is currently undervalued. But the market does understand balance sheets! And AMD is going to KEEP out performing expectations because the IT market rewards superior technology and therefore buy the ONLY option AMD!
I guess tomorrow China gives there blessing on AMD / Xilinx deal...￼
Sweeter than Sweet! Go AMD !
Now that slow steady climb to 114 with a few bumps in the road
"No change in story and fundamentals. I hope you are taking advantage of these prices because they won't last, AMD is the company of the future and in few years when it reaches the 500's that you won't be blaming yourself for not investing. Have a blessed day everyone."

"AMD will be explosive in the days ahead! They're working on their own big.Little ARM chip, and with the acquisition of Xilinx will own all chip markets. AMD has only just begun their incredible growth strategy.

"Here is the latest on the charts as Bulls are in play with AMD! Benzinga called the Big Bull Flag on Aug. 18 and AMD took a 4% rise on the bullish trading. Now another smaller bull flag has formed after the rise up between Monday and Tuesday paired with the consolidation on Wednesday and Thursday.You may have noticed the Bulls in play as we formed a long-legged doji candlestick on the daily chart. This shows that every time the stock traded down toward $106.84 level, bulls came in and bought the dip. The long-legged doji candlestick could indicate the bottom is in and that AMD is primed to trade higher on Friday on any good news.AMD has some headroom too with resistance formed at the $111 level. After that there is no further resistance until AMD's all-time high of $122.49.All we need is a little good news tailwind to start knocking on $111."
Everybody likes a story stock. AMD is a if not the premier story stock. AMD is fun to own. AMD is a winner. Who does not know the AMD story? Apparently a couple of hedge fund short managers have their heads up their behinds so far they can see daylight. That's another fun story.

Almost the entire market is in red and our AMD is amazingly streamlining just below the surface. Next inhale will bring life back and make it green again. How “long” can one hold his breadth? :o)Super Long AMD!
"My Fav comments from the last Investor Place article- At $93.31, AMD stock is still affordable when compared to peers such as NVDA stock at $808.48 a share.The recent rise in AMD stock has been fueled by a June 17 announcement that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had chosen AMD’s newest data center chip to help power its cloud computing services. Additionally, AMD’s $35 billion takeover of peer chipmaker Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) recently cleared a key regulatory hurdle when the European Commission said it has no objections to the proposed deal.Analysts have a median price target on AMD stock of $107, implying a further 23% gain, (and this is my FAV part-) and expect sharp gains once the Xilinx acquisition closes later this year.""EXPECT SHARP GAINS! Gotta love it!!!"
The demise of AMD is grossly misrepresented as the shorties build their hopes and dreams on the misinformation they've constantly vented. All while AMD has taken the longs above 100. I 'm looking forward to the ride to 200. We'll be making another run tomorrow all aboard buy the dips and get rich off of AMD chips.
"So, I guess the news this morning was not enough to save this stock?"
"These are the best stocks that I have seen, studied and traded since February 2016. There may be better. But these are the best stocks I have discovered.They are all very promising. But to this day I have sold each one off and concentrated on AMD only keeping AMD and Nvidia. Not in this list but in the semi industry were also Intel and MU. But they did not make the top stocks list.Performance from February 2016 to today11,668%. EXPI. $0.35 - $41.198,217%. GBTC. $0.47 - $39.095,638%. AMD. $1.83 - $105.023,925%. CYRX. $1.43 - $57.573,065%. NVDA. $6.43 - $203.532,964%. FIVN. $6.20 - $190.00As you can see AMD is not the top stock, true. But If you do Due Diligence on each one you will find that in the end only AMD packs the top end growth, talent and sure fire management to be the next Blue Chip stock.As I have always posted since 2017 AMD is:$18 @ 2Q18, $36 @ 2Q19, $100 @ 2H20, $250 @ 1H22 My doubles profile is why I have sold off the others and dollar cost averaged AMD.By Christmas AMD will be $150 and a 8,096% gain. In a few short months, in 1H22 AMD will be $250 and a 13,561% gain beating all in the top stock list."

"Price Increase by TSM Is Priced In. Not something we need to be concerned about. TSM didn't open up shop this AM(yesterday)and say we need a price increase. No, in big business, everything is negotiated long before any press announcement. Anyone living in the moment could’ve seen it coming , just as we see the prices of everything around us catching the Joe B Effect. As I stated last week, AMD will test the 52 week high in the coming weeks. Remember that prices will adjust depending on demand. Also when companies adjust prices they see no end in sight for the demand of the products or widgets if you may that they produce. Increases are always passed on when the demand remains high. As you can see Demand is Rocketing based on AMD’s Forward Guidance. AMD is a Real Gem in the making with Lisa Su at the helm. I have No Problem stating that AMD will have an NVDA type run as we move forward. ……………..ace"

But they see no problem with NVDA going up more than that post earnings with a nosebleed PE and slower growth. And I’m tired of CNBC saying NVDA has the “programming language” of the future, that line is getting old. I’m not an NVDA hater, but there shouldn’t be this much of a gap between AMD and Nvidia."

Notice AMD closed down $0.49 and XLNX closed up $0.54. This brought Xilinx closer to the 1.7234 fixed exchange ratio.This indicated an increased sentiment that the merger will close. I expect the ratio to rise up to 1.55 just before closing. That is what the trading ratio remanded for months after the merger announcement.
"This is hilarious... Raja Koduri, senior vice president of Intel's accelerated computing systems and graphics group, conceded it had been years since Intel challenged Nvidia at speeding up artificial intelligence software, a market that has powered much of the chip industry's expansion in recent years. Koduri said the ""Ponte Vecchio"" chip is faster than Nvidia's offerings at some of those tasks. ""For a decade, we let them just have free reign,"" Koduri said. ""That ends now."" I think Raja means that Nvidia's ""free reign"" will start to possibly end once Intel gets started in 2025."

Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.

"AMD Zen4 will support AVX5128/18/2021 IT HouseIT Home News on August 18 AMD official documents now confirm that Zen4 supports the AVX512 instruction set. Earlier, some whistleblowers said that Zen4 will not only support AVX-512, but also Bfloat16 and other new instruction sets.Last week, Gigabyte was attacked by hackers, and 112GB of data has since been leaked, including information about AMD's next-generation EPYC processor (code-named Genoa). These chips will have a 96-core design, support 12-channel DDR5 memory, and introduce AVX-512 instruction set support for the AMD lineup for the first time.IT Home has learned that AVX-512 (Advanced Vector Extension 512) is a 512-bit extension of the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instruction for the x86 instruction set architecture proposed by Intel in July 2013, and is used in Intel’s Xeon Phi x200 It can be implemented in Skylake-X CPU to accelerate the performance of workloads and use cases, such as scientific simulation, financial analysis, artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning, 3D modeling and analysis, image and audio/video processing, cryptography and data Compression etc.However, due to the significant impact on performance after turning on AVX-512, Intel's 12th-generation processor Alder Lake will cancel support for AVX-512 instruction set support.AMD Ryzen 6000 series processors will be the first to support DDR5 memory, and will use the AM5 chipset based on the LGA1718 socket and a new IHS design. It is expected to be unveiled in the second or third quarter of next year."
There are not fewer chips for sale than there were a year ago. The chip shortage is because of a new demand that exceeds current supply. Chip companies are not making less money because of the shortage. They are making more by shifting priduction to most profitable areas.

Now, AMD has begun to add them to the ROCm development tool.In the latest ROCclr (Radeon Open Computing Common Language Runtime) code, you can already see the two names of Navi 31 and Navi 33, which are the flagship core and mainstream core of the AMD RDNA3 family, respectively.There is also a high-end core Navi 32 between the two, and there may be a small core Navi 34 below.Go AMD!!!"
XLNX discount pushing 22% again.... Buying XLNX..... dating the little sister to get a shot at Big Sis!
$INTC (itnel inside) is changing its name to the Celeron Company. AMD does not contest the low end.
I bought it just now and won’t look at AMD stock for one year. Will only pay attention to company’s earning reports and the Zen4 and rdna3 specs to compare with competitors’ products. I like how AMD is working relentlessly in making their products better. Hope they succeed and I be rich.
This is one of the the companies that will be everywhere in the fuerte every game console and every car that has infotainment system will have this chips and solos nvda’s
Hmm...Shares Short dropped around 16 mil past couple of weeks? Bashers here were full of fake bravado as they retreated and licked their wounds? Imagine if this repeats over the next couple of months...
"Tesla, Amazon, Samsung, and the British Government all nix the ARM $NVDA merger. I can't post the links."

Intel’s Gelsinger dreams of a “comeback of the century”. AMD delivers chips that “trounce” Apple’s.
All these fish stories with Intc chips they can seamlessly change into a fish & chips manufacturer or Gelsy can go work for a fish & chips franchise

"Great news on China Approval of AMD acquisition. It is drawing closer to approval! “ MLex also believes that the deal has entered Phase Two of the SAMR's investigation, which involves tighter scrutiny of its effects on overall market competition. The comparison to Intel's Altera acquisition is significant, as it hints that the Xilinx acquisition might also be on its way to secure Chinese approval.”If you read this on seeking Alpha then Joshua Fineman just lead you to believe it was bad news. But that is NOT what his source (MLex ) said.https://wccftech.com/amds-xilinx-acquisition-enters-second-phase-of-chinese-regulatory-scrutiny/"

"It is also worth noting that $AMD pricing power has increased, leading to an increase in processor ASP. On the other hand, $INTC is struggling to cope with a sharp decline in ASP. Chipzilla’s desktop processor ASP fell 5% year-on-year in the last quarter, while notebook ASPs fell 17% after taking discounts to transfer more products. On the other hand, AMD is taking advantage of the technology and performance advantages of Intel chips to charge a premium for AMD processors. In view of higher shipments, customers are obviously willing to pay."
"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 30, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) announced that the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) has chosen AMD EPYC processors to power a new supercomputer, called Polaris, which will prepare researchers for the forthcoming exascale supercomputer at Argonne called Aurora."
"Now that the day traders have got their sandwich money, let's go AMD!"
"Notice how the bashers keep pushing $90 as the number where this is going now? There is a coordinated reason for this. Professional manipulators use what’s called the anchoring effect. If your stock is currently at $70, they’ll say things like “I’m a buyer at $50.” This causes you to question your investment thesis. Did you get in too early? Is bad news about to drop? Your brain becomes attached to the 50 number. There’s science to prove it. You can even test it with your friends. Ask one friend if he thinks Abraham Lincoln was older or younger than 50 when he died. Then ask that same friend at exactly what age do they think Lincoln died. Odds are they’ll give a number around 50 due to the anchoring effect. Now, ask a second friend the same set of questions, but change the age from 50 to 100. Odds are the second friend will give a number closer to 100. Shorts/bashers here have been doing this over and over with AMD, every step of the way up. Every $10 up it goes they focus on 15-20% down from that number. If you know it when you see it, their tactics are obvious."
"Outstanding day for AMD! Fighting the negative trend, big time!"

"July 15th, 2021 10:58Citi throws in towel on AMD sell call, hikes target nearly $80 per shareMarket MoverJessica de Sa-Mota - emailCiti recommends a pair trade of overweight AMD, underweight IntelCiti analyst Christopher Danely upgraded AMD (AMD) to Neutral from Sell as his checks indicate the company's share gains are ""finally accelerating"" in the server market, especially at hyper-scale companies such as AWS (AMZN) and Google (GOOG). The analyst, who expects AMD's momentum to continue, thinks Intel's (INTC) gross margins could dip into the 40's, similar to what was seen during the last AMD product cycle.SERVER SHARE 'FINALLY' ACCELERATING: Citi analyst Christopher Danely upgraded AMD to Neutral from Sell with a price target of $95, up from $17. The analyst's channel checks indicate AMD share gains ""are finally accelerating"" in the server market, especially at hyper-scale companies such as Amazon Web Services and Google. Danely noted that AMD server market share increased 1.5% in the first quarter for the first time in fifteen years. He expects AMD's share gains to accelerate and reach 20% in 2022, close to the previous peak, and believes the company can continue its growth trajectory due to continued production delays at Intel, which he thinks might happen for 7nm products as well.Overall, the analyst expects the momentum to continue and believes Intel's gross margin percentage could dip into the 40's, similar to the last AMD product cycle. Additionally, he expects a price war in CPUs when the PC space cools and as Intel market share loss worsens in high margin server segments. Danely, who raised estimates on AMD, recommends a pair trade of overweight AMD and underweight Intel.WHAT'S NOTABLE: After Intel confirmed it is working with TSMC (TSM) for its 2023 product lineup, but intimated it would not be for ""core"" microprocessors, Citi's Danely told investors last week that he believes outsourcing CPUs to TSMC would help Intel gain back share. Nonetheless, the analyst argued that this will take at least two years. In the meantime, he expects AMD's share gains in the server market to accelerate and result in downside to Intel estimates. Danely has a Neutral rating on Intel shares.PRICE ACTION: In Thursday morning trading, shares of AMD have dropped about 1% to $88.01."
We believe AMD will close above $150 this week!
"AMD is holding its HOD well, but XLNX's HOD is dropping, as you may have noticed. I think if I had traded some AMD shares for XLNX shares like some of you are doing, I'd sell the XLNX shares today, especially since there's a $3.60 gap up in XLNX's share price today."
I've just noticed that today's (Friday's) share price stats are almost a mirror-image of 2 weeks ago. The basic difference is the volume. Today's volume is much less than 2 weeks ago. So I have the distinct impression that AMD's share price is setting up for a nice run real soon:DATE...........HIGH..........LOW............CLOSE..............VOLUME8/27/21....111.78 107.80......111.11...............55M8/13/21....111.71......106.57......110.55..............100M

"Upon completion of the merger AMD will take a huge boost into AI markets and Automotive Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These are areas where AMD can now excel together with Xilinx.Here is the latest in what AMD is buying.9:00a ET 8/31/2021 - BusinessWireXilinx and Motovis Introduce Complete Hardware and Software Solution to Further Automotive Forward Camera InnovationXilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX), the leader in adaptive computing, and Motovis, a provider of embedded AI autonomous driving, announced today that the two companies are collaborating on a solution that pairs the Xilinx Automotive (XA) Zynq(R) system-on-chip (SoC) platform and Motovis' convolutional neural network (CNN) IP to the automotive market, specifically for forward camera systems' vehicle perception and control. The solution builds upon Xilinx's corporate initiative to provide customers with robust platforms to enhance and speed development.Forward camera systems are a critical element of advanced driver-assistance systems because they provide the advanced sensing capabilities required for safety-critical functions, including lane-keeping assistance (LKA), automatic emergency braking (AEB), and adaptive cruise control (ACC). The solution, which is available now, supports a range of parameters necessary for the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 2022 requirements by utilizing convolutional neural networks to achieve a cost-effective combination of low-latency image processing, flexibility and scalability.""This collaboration is a significant milestone for the forward camera market, as it will allow automotive OEMs to innovate faster,"" said Ian Riches, vice president for the Global Automotive Practice at Strategy Analytics.

Smart money is holding this stock for years to come. Say goodbye to Intel, and hello to the future."
"It is always so obvious in retrospect. I believe the big money knew what Chairman Powell was gonna say. And I also believe that was why there was all the chatter from the ""experts"" that he was gonna be more bearish. This also helped set up the shorts for a whupping. I saw the OBV line on AMD & other great growth & semi-stocks (BMBL, NVDA, U, UMC, WDAY) were in full boogie mode. Even yesterday, AMD was being bought rigorously at the lower price points. Once again, special congrats to all the long timers here who have been with this stock for many, many years."

Report from Bank of America on AMD, 12-AUG (highlights only) -Best EPS revisions, yet trading at 40% discount to peersWe reiterate our Buy on AMD with a $135 PO, or 25% upside to current levels. We seestrong catch-up potential (AMD up just 16% YTD vs SOX up 18%), despite the strongestupward EPS revisions in semis and with a clear path to ~doubling EPS to ~$5/sh onconsistent roadmap execution/share gains against INTC who is distracted by expandinginto non-core foundry market. We highlight five reasons to stay positive on AMD whoalong with NVDA/MRVL forms our top 3 picks in our favored area of compute semis.Rule #1, 2, and 3 in semi stock picking: follow the GMIn our view the most important metric of value capture (differentiation, pricing, coststructure) in semis. We see AMD’s GM expand ~350bps YoY to 48% in CY21E, andanother 200bps+ to 50%+ in the next two years – likely among the top 3 GM expansionin semis. AMD’s roadmap execution/TSMC partnership is providing a highly competitiveand predictable cost structure against INTC’s low 10nm yields (likely even lower 7nmyields in CY22/23E) and GMs that are unlikely to improve beyond 54-57%.Path to doubling EPS to $5/sh in next 2-3 yearsWe est. AMD will claim ~15% share of the $66bn (PC + Server) microprocessor mkt., up500bps YoY. Our current above-cons. estimates imply revenue share at 20% by CY23Egenerating around $4 in pf-EPS. However, we see no reason why AMD cannot attemptto go after 30-35% share which could push EPS towards $5+. As shown on Pg. 2, weestimate that AMD has claimed ~60% of the incremental sales growth in PC + ServerMPU over the last 3 years, an acceleration from the 40% incremental share in thetrailing 5-yr period. AMD is exposed to attractive, duopolistic compute markets withlimited exposure to more cyclical smartphone, memory, autos/industrial demand.INTC roadmap carries high execution riskINTC’s Accelerated event clarified its roadmap, but execution carries a considerable levelof risk in our view (4 node migrations planned in 3 years vs. 1 node change executed inpast 5-6yrs), enough to incentivize customers to shift more share towards AMD. INTC’sroadmap uncertainty was a key overhang on AMD stock in 1H21E in our view, and nowthat clarity provides a stronger path to AMD to plan and announce its products thatremain a generation ahead (AMD 5nm Genoa likely midCY22 ahead of INTC’s 7nmSapphire Rapids ramping in similar timeframe).PC exposure derisked for 2HWe assume AMD PC sales largely flattish HoH in 2H21 versus PC market seasonalgrowth of ~15% HoH over the last 5-6 years.

AMD) in the S&P 500 Infotechgroup that are projected to grow sales at a 20%+ CAGR from CY20-23. At 35x PE and7x EV/S, AMD is trading at an unjustified ~40% discount to this group, in our view....."
"By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from $Intc Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The Nvidia and AMD machine, to be called Polaris, will not be a replacement for the Intel-based Aurora machine slated for the Argonne National Lab near Chicago, which was poised to be the nation's fastest computer when announced in 2019."

$AMD and $NVDA stock prices exploded upward after earnings. With Intel your lucky to see a ten cent move. It makes no sense to investor in Intel. My god even TXN or ADI have far outpeformed. The proof is in the chart. Don't believe the two or three Intel employees who post here trying to talk up their stock. If you are looking to invest you should look elsewhere in the sector and leave the old tired Intel dog alone.
"Just keep buying AMD so it can go to 200.00 and beyond like all the longs are saying. It hasn't gone down significantly in years without an immediate rebound. And since institutions hold about 3/4 of the shares, they won't let it go down."

(AMD)Intel Corporation (INTC)By: Rex Crum, SA News EditorNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are reportedly close to a deal that would involve their chips powering a new U.S. Department of Energy supercomputer.According to Reuters, the Energy Department wants the get the new supercomputer online as it waits for a machine set to run on Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chips that has been delayed for two months. The Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) chips will reportedly be used in a supercomputer called Polaris that itself will be used to test software set to run in the Intel (INTC) machine when it eventually is ready for use.The Intel (INTC) supercomputer, called Aurora, is scheduled to be used at the Argonne National Lab near Chicago. Intel (INTC) was originally scheduled to deliver Aurora this year, but production delays due to chip shortages have pushed that timeframe until 2022.The Polaris machine will not be as fast as the Aurora computer, but will be able to do some Aurora-type calculations at slower speeds, according to the report.So: Intel is faster but they can't deliver.....hahaha!"
Only ten days to $150. Another hedge fund short will cover. That leaves three more.

"I am a long, but incredibly frustrated. AMD is taking market share every quarter, has great products, and is very profitable every quarter with great future quarter outlooks.

"Get a load of fancypants no-enemies AMD-Xilinx: 'Large majority' of third parties 'had no concerns' about pair's hookupThe UK’s competition regulator has finally published its reasons why it has decided not to stand in the way of the $35bn merger between AMD and Xilinx.After two months of number crunching, market sleuthing and evidence-taking, the Competition and Market’s Authority (CMA) concluded that it “does not believe that it is or may be the case that the merger [between AMD and Xilinx] may be expected to result in an SLC (substantial lessening of competition) within a market or markets in the United Kingdom.”What's more, the CMA also found little opposition within the industry even going as far as to say that the merger could be ""pro-competitive"".Xilinx snaps up 'accelerated computing' specialist Silexica for its SLX FPGA tool suiteUK's competition watchdog sniffs around AMD's proposed $35bn all-stock buy of XilinxRemember AMD, Xilinx were merging?

However, full written details of the CMA’s decision were only published today.In an 11-page statement, the CMA said it considered whether the proposed merger could stifle competition but found no evidence to support the concerns.Even customers and competitors didn’t have an issue when the competition authority called for comment as part of the consultation phase.“The large majority of third parties that responded to the CMA’s merger investigation did not express concerns regarding the Merger and some suggested that the Merger would be pro-competitive,” the ruling said.source: The Register."

"AMD MANIPULATION games pre market, during market & post market are non events...its what ""they do""But XLINX is up almost 5%....could it be Jim saw the sun?"
"NVDA is currently trading at about 200x estimated EPS for the quarter that just ended in July. Based on estimated revenue of $4.1B for AMD in Q3, non-GAAP EPS should be around $0.68, giving a comparable SP value of $136. But Lisa Su always underestimates future revenue, so I would expect Q3 revenue to be at least $4.25B. That would give EPS of around $0.725 for a par SP value of $145. After the XLNX deal closes and Q3 reports are in, I'd say $150 should be in sight, with well over $5B in combined quarterly revenue going forward."
"People are buying XLNX because they want that 30% to 35% boost from the merger. They calculate that the reward is greater than the risk.People who do not trust that the merger will close think buying XLNX is foolish. Granted, it is complex. They don’t know. So of course they “feel” risk is high. In essence they are risk averse, on a “feeling” that they can’t calculate. Actually you may be surprised to know that buying XLNX reduces appreciation risk! I will explain that below.Also some people can’t calculate the 30% to 35% reward either. But realistically that is what the reward is for buying XLNX in order to get more AMD, assuming AMD is going up of course.30% to 35% reward.... Sound surprising? Do you think it’s more? Or less?OK, let’s say you want to buy more Christmas presents and you have $150. Should you buy AMD or XLNX and hold till Christmas ? Hmmmmm....Assume: today you have $150 in your account, XLNX is $150 and AMD is $108, the merger closes in October with AMD $120 and AMD will go up to $150 before Christmas. Let’s be optimistic!Skip to summary if you hate math.Option 1 you buy one share of AMD at $108 and keep $42 in your account. By Christmas AMD is up 38.8% at $150 and you sell after taxes for $141.60. ($33.60 a 31.1% Post tax gain!) Add that to the $42 (assuming) you never spent and you now have $183.60 to by Christmas presents. Cool!Option 2 you buy one share of Xilinx $150. When the merger closes in October AMD is sitting at $120. After the 1.7234 exchange ratio your account is already showing $206.80! But wait, it’s not Christmas yet and AMD still has $30 to reach our $150 mark by Christmas assumption. By Christmas your 1.7234 shares of AMD is now $258.51. Still taxes are due on $18 of pre-merger AMD gain. The rest is tax free under IRC 1032. You now have $254.91 for Christmas presents.SUMMARY Option 1 buy 1 share of AMD and get a 31.1% gain of $33.60Option 2 buy 1 share of Xilinx get just under 70% gain of $104.91(Caveat: At 100 shares it is more practical. But the % gains are the same. The merger boost will be around 30% to 35% assuming AMD rises like we think it will.)So here is one last thought. What if AMD did not go up so much. AMD may not go up to $150. AMD is notorious for trading sideways. XLNX could stay at 150. AMD could stay at $108. In that case Option 1 gets you NOTHING! ZIP! No gain, Right?But Option 2 still gets you that merger boost on the 1.7234 AMD fixed merger exchange rate. Your $150 XLNX goes to $186.12 AMD or a 24% gain on AMD even though our AMD is flat. AND ITS ALL TAX FREE!The merger boost reduces risk by putting a floor on your minimal AMD gain... guaranteed... by AMD!"

You can always count on AMD after market is up big again to close at low of day losing really all of morning gains to the last cent. AMD never disappoints. Perhaps we even close red on a day like this. If futures are down tomorrow premarket under 110. I must laugh hard when some people write here that this is a healthy consolidation. Consolidation of what? This stock was few weeks back at over 122 and for nearly 2 weeks every day in a free fall. I believe markets were up now 6 days in a row. What will happen to AMD if we get an overdue losing day ? You know the answer.

"It really is so funny to me how Shorts try to grasp hope out of thin air. There's several comments here today about how AMD is RED. Oh noooo. Sky is falling. They no longer can even say it's down 1%, or even half a percent. AMD was down at close 0.07 percent. If one can even call that a down. But to shorts, every little bit of hope is worth hanging onto. I really feel bad for shorts at the same time. Wondering why can't they learn and stop their loss by making a simple change. Buy AMD shares. Just Hold it, at least 6 months. It really is that simple....The, 3mt, 6mt, 1yr and 5 year charts shows you how simple it is."
Cannot believe the average person is not seeing the value in AMD. Share price up 13% YTD. Estimated earnings growth of 93% and revenue growth of 60%. I’m confident we will end the year at at least 100% earnings and 75% revenue growth based on Lisa’s conservative estimates. An opportunity like this is extremely rare to come across. Also note that our growth rates are above NVDA’s for a valuation comparison. Good luck everyone!

"[XLNX will be a great partner to get AMD into the auto business]:Forward Camera Innovation -- BUSINESS WIRE 2:00 PM ET 8/31/2021 Targeted at the $2.4B1 forward camera market, companies kick off new engagement focused on delivering an extensive solution to enable faster time to market for carmakers SAN JOSE, Calif. & SHANGHAI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xilinx, Inc.(XLNX) , the leader in adaptive computing, and Motovis, a provider of embedded AI autonomous driving, announced today that the two companies are collaborating on a solution that pairs the Xilinx Automotive (XA) Zynq system-on-chip (SoC) platform and Motovis’ convolutional neural network (CNN) IP to the automotive market, specifically for forward camera systems’ vehicle perception and control. The solution builds upon Xilinx’s corporate initiative to provide customers with robust platforms to enhance and speed development. Forward camera systems are a critical element of advanced driver-assistance systems because they provide the advanced sensing capabilities required for safety-critical functions, including lane-keeping assistance (LKA), automatic emergency braking (AEB), and adaptive cruise control (ACC). The solution, which is available now, supports a range of parameters necessary for the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 2022 requirements by utilizing convolutional neural networks to achieve a cost-effective combination of low-latency image processing, flexibility and scalability. “This collaboration is a significant milestone for the forward camera market, as it will allow automotive OEMs to innovate faster,” said Ian Riches, vice president for the Global Automotive Practice at Strategy Analytics. “The forward camera market has tremendous growth opportunity, where we anticipate almost 20 percent year-on-year volume growth over 2020 to 2025. Together, Xilinx(XLNX) and Motovis are delivering a highly optimized hardware and software solution that will greatly serve the needs of automotive OEMs, especially as new standards emerge and requirements continue to grow.” The forward camera solution scales across the 28nm and 16nm XA Zynq SoC families using Motovis’ CNN IP, a unique combination of optimized hardware and software partitioning capabilities with customizable CNN-specific engines that host Motovis’ deep learning networks – resulting in a cost-effective offering at different performance levels and price points. The solution supports image resolutions up to eight megapixels. For the first time, OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers can now layer their own feature algorithms on top of Motovis’ perception stack to differentiate and future-proof their designs. “We are extremely pleased to unveil this new initiative with Xilinx(XLNX) and to bring to market our CNN forward camera solution. Customers designing systems enabled with AEB and LKA functionality need efficient neural network processing within an SoC that gives them flexibility to implement future features easily,” said Dr. Zhenghua Yu, CEO, Motovis. “With Motovis’ customizable deep learning networks and the Xilinx Zynq platform’s ability to host CNN-specific engines that provide unmatched efficiency and optimization, we’re helping to future-proof the design to meet customer needs.” Market forces continue to drive adoption of forward camera systems to adhere to global government mandates and consumer watch groups, including The European Commission General Safety Regulation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the NCAP. All three have issued formal mandates or strong guidance regarding automakers’ implementations of LKA and AEB in new vehicles produced between 2020-2025 and onward. “Expanding our XA offering with a comprehensive solution for the forward camera market puts a cost-optimized, high-performance solution in the hands of our customers. We’re thrilled to bring this to life and drive the industry forward,” said Willard Tu, senior director of Automotive, Xilinx(XLNX). “Motovis’ expertise in embedded deep learning and how they’ve optimized neural networks to handle the immense challenges of forward camera perception puts us both in a unique position to gain market share, all while accelerating our OEM customers’ time to market.” Xilinx (XLNX) and Motovis will be speaking at the Xilinx Adapt 2021 virtual event on September 15, 2021. Adapt 2021 will feature executive keynotes with appearances from partners and customers, along with a series of more than 100 presentations, forums, product trainings and labs designed to help users unlock the value of adaptive computing."

"Exynos with RDNA technology could be a total game-changer for AMD next year. So far, I haven't seen any analysts writing about this. Rumors are that not only Samsung, but also OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi will use these chips in their phones. Together, they produce over 600M phones each year. The big question is: will RDNA only go in the flagship Exynos 2200 chip, or will it also be incorporated in the mid-range and more widely produced Exynos 1200 chip? A second question is: will Samsung sell their Galaxy S22 phones in the US with their own chip, or will they still use the Qualcomm chips due to licensing agreements regarding the modem?If the RDNA chips are only used in Samsung's own flagship phones, there might be only 25M of them produced next year. That would still add between $125M and $500M to AMD's sales, depending on what the royalty is, most of which would go straight to the bottom line. That adds between $.07 to $.26 to EPS for the combined AMD/XLNX, after tax.However, if the RDNA chips are placed in most of the mid-range phones, not only of Samsung but also the others, there could be 500M+ of them produced next year. That would add between $2.5B and $10.0B to AMD's sales, or between $1.29 and $5.15 in EPS. If we assume royalties of $10 per chip, that's $2.58 in EPS--in addition to the $3.00+ EPS that AMD/XLNX would already be making for the year without these royalties.What kind of multiple would that garner? At 50, the SP would be at least $280 next year. Clearly, a lot hinges on whether RDNA will make it into the mid-range chips and how many other manufacturers decide to use it. I can't wait for the Samsung announcement later this year."

AMD is becoming less volatile as the hedge fund shorts give up and take their losses.
ARM deal is jeopardized yet NVDA hits all time high daily like there is no end. Bloated PE and yet they feel deal will go through.For AMD the only pending approval is with SAMR and that hasn't had any hurdle. What could be holding it down below 150 at this point?
"AMD chart shows a pattern of behavior by the market maker specialists. The price does a flat side ways waffle for long periods while the specialists accumulate shares. There aren't many sellers and there are a lot of competing buyers. Thus the price is flat for a long time. After the specialist has an inventory he quickly ramps the price and sells his inventory for a fat profit. Next he brings the price down a little bit and does another sideways waffle accumulation. This pattern repeats many times on the chart. Institutional shorts are another matter. They expect to cover with discount Xylinx conversion shares after the merger. Unfortunately the price has jumped way more than the discount. These arbitrage shorts are losing bigly. Desperation has set in. This Monday and Tuesday naked short volume was 60% of daily trade, yet they could not push the price down. Eager institutions and market makers bought every share, thank you.Shorts are increasing their short position by 1 million shares per week, net 90 million shares shorted. Shorts cannot cover without jacking the price. Instead of covering they dig a deeper hole. After the merger the tide goes out and we'll know who was swimming naked."

"Using a pair of 32-core AMD EPYC CPUs, 1TB of memory and 510TB of disks, the pi ratio π is calculated to 62.8 trillion digits: breaking the world recordAfter 108 days and 9 hours, the Swiss University broke the world record. The Graubunden University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland has set a world record for calculating the pi ratio π, and it claims to have calculated to 62.8 trillion digits after the decimal point.The university announced this record yesterday, claiming that it is 12.8 trillion digits more than previous attempts, and that it is 3.5 times faster than previous attempts in calculating this irrational ratio.The university also announced the details of the hardware to achieve this feat. A pair of 32-core AMD EPYC 7542 CPUs power the university’s computing equipment. AMD said that the CPU most of the time runs at 2.9GHz, which can be speeded up to 3.4GHz, equipped with 28MB L3 cache, and each CPU can easily run 64 threads. A server equipped with 1TB of memory was also used , and Ubuntu 20.04 was installed on a pair of solid-state hard drives with an unspecified capacity.A set of JBOD is equipped with 38 hard drives with a rotation speed of 7200RPM, each with a capacity of 16TB. Among them, 34 disks are used to store values exchanged from memory-this design was chosen because memory is very expensive. The reason for choosing ordinary hard disks instead of solid-state hard disks is that the performance of solid-state hard disks will decrease over time. The university’s designers are also worried that intensive calculations may cause problems.Compared with the 96-vCPU initiative that Google used to calculate the pi ratio to 31.4 trillion digits after the decimal point in 2019, the computing equipment configuration of the Graubünden University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland is average.An application software called ""y-Cruncher"" accomplishes this task and is configured to transfer data from the server to 34 disks in parallel at a speed of approximately 8.5GB/sec.Sharp-eyed readers will notice that JBOD has 38 disks-the other 4 disks are used to store the Pi value itself!The last ten digits stored on these disks are 7817924264, which are now the last known digits of Pi."

Like I said yesterday that NVDA will give a strong report which will bode well for AMD and its peers and they did. The fact that competition is always healthy and knowing which companies are better for your own business is also great. With that said I hope that instead of being so negative for something that you don't have any control with that at least give yourself a positive pat on the shoulder that you are healthy and that your family and friends are the same. What I am trying to say is that don't be too hard on yourself. Smile and take a deep breath because you are blessed investing in a powerful company like AMD that in few years will be at 500+ per share stock price if you are patient enough to put some time in. Have fun and enjoy your day everyone.

"Pre-Exascale SupercomputerAugust 30, 2021 by Brian WangU.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) unveiled a new testbed supercomputer to prepare critical workloads for future exascale systems that will deliver up to four times faster performance than Argonne’s current supercomputers.Polaris will enable scientists and developers to test and optimize software codes and applications to tackle a range of artificial intelligence (AI), engineering and scientific projects planned for the forthcoming exascale supercomputer, Aurora, a joint collaboration between Argonne, Intel and HPE.The $500+ million Exaflop Aurora was planned for 2021 but it has been delayed until 2022-2023. Aurora has been delayed waiting for Intel’s Sapphire Rapids server chips. The first plan was for a 180 petaflop Aurora for 2018 but delays in earlier Intel chips caused the need for a new plan.Polaris will deliver approximately 44 petaflops of peak double precision performance and nearly 1.4 exaflops of theoretical AI performance, which is based on mixed-precision compute capabilities. Polaris 1.4 AI ExaFLOPS does not use standard FP64 (64 bit floating point) for standard supercomputer performance metrics.It will be built using 280 HPE Apollo Gen10 Plus systems, which are HPC and AI architectures built for the exascale era and customized to include the following end-to-end solutions:* Powerful compute to improve modeling, simulation and data-intensive workflows using 560 2nd and 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors* Supercharged AI capabilities to support data and image-intensive workloads while optimizing future exascale-level GPU-enabled deployments using 2240 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs, making it ALCF’s largest GPU-based system to date.* Addressing demands for higher speed and congestion control for larger data-intensive and AI workloads with HPE Slingshot, the world’s only high-performance Ethernet fabric designed for HPC and AI solutions. HPE Slingshot will also be featured in Argonne’s Aurora exascale system.* Enabling fine-grained centralized monitoring and management for optimal performance with HPE Performance Cluster Manager, a system management software solution.The delivery and installation of Polaris is scheduled to begin this month. It will go into use starting early 2022 and will be open to the broader HPC community in spring of 2022 to prepare workloads for the next generation of DOE’s high performance computing resources."
This is probably the thing about AMD I understand the least. Why does AMD have good days when the majority of the market is tanking but then perform poorly when the market is soaring?
Simple math - what will Xilinx's merger do to AMD's combined EPS? After merger there will be 17B shares. Xilinx float shares at 255M earned $0.76 EPS. Total of $193.8M divided by 1.7B results in an ADDITIONAL OF $0.114 EPS! That's based on last 1Q ER. For 2Q growth expected. So suddenly AMD's EPS is higher just like that plus Xilinx's free cash at $1.44B provides immediate money... go verify the info!
"A few key things to remember for converted dollars to a Roth: Generally, the dollars converted to a Roth must stay in the Roth for five years to avoid penalties and taxes.

I apologize for a silly question in advance! What do we think the share price will be when the Xlinix takeover begins to be listed under AMD? I would like to think it’s a $150.00 all day! Then quick assent to $200! I probably read it months ago but if AMD surges. Pre merger it’s quite a very good odds on A buy today hopefully under $110.00 I’m buying just a bit to give me a round number of shares . I only need 30 more!
120 today maybe?

The psychology behind the falling wedge pattern is that as the price action narrows down the buyers become more aggressive while the sellers don’t have enough power to continue pressing down the paddle.If you compress an object hard enough after it reaches a maximum level of compression it will snap back hard. The same principle can be applied to the falling wedge pattern which is the reason why it has such a tremendous potential to make substantial profits.
"Intel, which occupies the global dominance of semiconductors, is now in turmoil. It has been under siege by AMD and ARM in the PC processor market and server chip market, and has been surpassed by TSMC in terms of chip manufacturing process.

"AMD Is Going Much Higher!! Day To Day Gyrations Are To Be Expected……………….ace“ Buying Advanced Micro Devices is a no-brainerAMD delivered sizzling second-quarter results recently. The company's revenue almost doubled year-over-year to $3.85 billion and adjusted earnings per share jumped 250% to $0.63. This outstanding performance encouraged AMD to raise its full-year revenue and margin guidance.AMD now anticipates 60% revenue growth in 2021, up from its original forecast of 37% growth issued in January this year. The company has also increased its adjusted gross margin estimate for 2021 to 48% from the earlier forecast of 47%. The interesting thing to note here is that AMD stock trades at a discount to its historical multiples. The company's trailing earnings multiple of 37 is lower than last year's average of 124, while the price-to-sales ratio of 9.4 represents a discount to AMD's 2020 multiple of 12.7.Given that AMD had delivered 45% revenue growth in 2020 and is on track to do better this year, buying the stock looks like a no-brainer. What's more, buying AMD stock will help investors take advantage of its impressive market share gains against Intel and the fast-growing gaming console market.Mercury Research reports that AMD's share of the x86 server market has hit a 14-year high of 22.5% in the second quarter of 2021. The company controlled just 12.3% of this market at the end of 2018. AMD's rapid market share gains against Intel are here to stay as it enjoys a technological advantage. That could translate into more revenue for AMD as Intel's client computing group generated $40 billion in revenue last year, while the former's total revenue was $9.8 billion in 2020.Meanwhile, AMD is winning big from the latest generation of gaming consoles. This is evident from the growth in the company's enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment that grew 183% year over year last quarter. AMD expects ""console demand to remain strong throughout the year,"" and the addition of a new console customer in the form of Valve's Steam Deck could give the segment a shot in the arm.Such tailwinds make it clear why AMD's earnings are expected to clock a 30%-plus annual growth rate over the long run, which is why investors should consider taking advantage of the relatively cheap valuation and buy this growth stock.”"
"Motley Fool asks ""Will AMD be worth more than Intel by 2025?"" IMO, it will happen this year! They did not take into account the merger with Xilinx. Once that happens, the additional shares mean AMD only has to go to $132.50 to reach Intel's current valuation of $218B. That seems easily within reach."

"On August 25th, an Intel processor with the model ""i7-12700"" was exposed on GeekBench, with a single-core score of 1595 and a multi-core score of 10170. Compared with i7-11700, this CPU performance has increased by about 15%, but it is still slightly inferior to AMD R7 5800X. From the 10th generation Core to the 11th generation Core, the AMD Ryzen 5000 series has always been 5800X silently. It seems that it is not Intel deliberately squeezing toothpaste, but really a drop of toothpaste is gone. However, there is still a doubt about the i7-12700. The previously exposed information shows that the 12th-generation i7 will use 8 large cores + 4 small cores, large cores with hyper-threading, and small cores without hyper-threading. A total of 20 threads are designed, even Windows 11. Optimized for large and small core scheduling. However, the data exposed by GeekBench shows that the i7-12700 has only 8 cores and 16 threads."
I estimate 8 million shares were shorted to protect the short position. 95 million shares are now short. That is not a tenable position. Heavy buy volume persists. Someone accumulated 8 million shares that do not exist and are tightly held.

"Analysts conveniently overlook AMD prospects in telecom/internet routers, cell phones, autonomous guided systems, robots, and personal artificial intelligence devices. These are new markets for AMD. Every institution wants to keep the secret because they are accumulating shares of AMD while it is cheap. Some are actively holding down the price. Shares are scarce. Nobody wants to sell.

Shorts need to buy back 8% of the float."

Don't be fooled. ..

"AMD's new product leakAM5 motherboard design exposure, processor with a maximum TDP of 170WIT House News on August 17As the last year of AM4 promised, AMD’s upcoming AM5 was finally leaked. It is reported that AM5 will use the Land Grid Array (LGA-1718) layout, which can be compatible with the existing AM4 radiator, which is more realistic than Intel.In addition, the leaked data sheet also confirmed the TDP information of the upcoming AM5 series, including 45W, 65W, 95W, 105W, 120W, 170W.It was previously reported that the AMD Raphael series has 120W and 170W TDP CPU models, and the latter requires 280 mm liquid cooling for heat dissipation.IT Home understands that the 120W TDP is an increase of 15W compared to the existing high-end AM4 design, but considering that Intel’s new-generation architecture processor TDP is 125W, AMD is expected to be prepared.Judging from the news, the AM5 socket will cooperate with AMD's next-generation Ryzen processor based on the Zen4 micro-architecture. It is expected to be used on AMD 600 series chipset motherboards, which will also introduce features such as DDR5 memory support."

Search for the article as Yahoo's bots won't let me post the link. A big short position has been taken in AMC last week. But while AMC has no financial justification to its current PPS, AMD has future such justification. Read the article entitled:""AMC, Didi, AMD — 3 Stocks To Watch Today Based On High Retail-Investor Interest""Saying. .. ""On Monday night, AMD featured among trending names on WSB.""Let's see if it gets traction today. WallStreetBets has over 10 millions following, if just 10% buy just $10000 worth of AMD's shares, that's $10 billions .and over 10m shares bought if within a day, could trigger short squeeze. Let's see..."
Some people are talking about tax savings after merger… xlnx merger is far away… if you have excess money then buy xlnx else stay away as it is dead investment…AMD is better buy

New highs coming .......
Back to the basics. AMD’s upward revision of earnings expectations and the subsequent upgrade of its rating means an improvement in the company’s basic business. Investors' appreciation for this ever-improving business trend should push up stock prices. It is that simple…
Does AMD have Big.little X86 chips? if not FLUSH. Windows 11 + alderlake will take big marketshares from AMD.
"AMAZING conclusion! Playing using FSR won't hurt image quality even in performance mode tgat COULD BE DETECTED in actual game play by humans! This means, FSR being so easy to implement, runs on anything, including coming AMD's Exynos Samsung smartphones for raytracing games, is making nVidia's DLSS a dinosaur to be gone soon! WOW! Read and watch actual video!""Now don't get us wrong, there are obviously differences between FSR modes and gaming at native resolution, because no matter which way you slice it actual image data is being discarded and then being reconstructed at a higher resolution using an algorithm. But the affect on the game is not exclusively related to image quality. Instead, as our previous benchmarks have shown, there is a huge improvement in FPS across the board with FidelityFX Super Resolution enabled.""No need expensive nVidia's GPUs. Use AMD's and in datacenters, nVidia's Ampere becoming obsolete too with coming 5nm cDNA 2 datacenters GPUs! This clearly means nVidia's a huge bubble to burst this year! https://hothardware.com/account/signin"
Solid trend line forming on the candlestick chart from 7-19-21 to 8-27-21.
"For all Intel equity holders, when you sell Intel would you buy undervalued AMD for $95.05 or buy overhyped Nvidia for $829.70?"
Classic Cup & Handle. i am sure IBD will mention this in the next couple of days.
"To all who are wondering about today's ""pop"" in price, first off Nasdaq is up 1.59% ""A rising tides lifts all boats."" Secondly, Xilinx shares and AMD are up on the news that Analog Devices purchase of Maxim got China's approval! Bodes well for the XLNX AMD deal but does not guarantee approval but again it's very promising. Go AMD. Go Longs."
Kris you are right After $111 next stop is $120+. Have a great weekend everyone.
We just learnt that China is going to approve AMD XLNX merger as early as next week!
MM/shorties took down $XLNX sp so AMD risk $$ inflow goes to XLNX instead of AMD. This is a nifty way to slow down the rise in $AMD sp where shorty was losing the 10am game !! Thanks shorties/mm I switched some AMD to XLNX a good play.
1% per day is more than double per year.
"Just checking in to see where the goal post is today---are the regular bashers still here saying ""$50 before $100 pps"" or are they at ""$80 before $150 pps""? I got the old bashers muted for awhile but now seeing new variants..."
Our day will come and we will have everything. Long and Strong. Great stock. Play your games now - but you will not get my stock.
Cramer mentioned AMD again stating that the merger with XLNX will be completed soon and that Q2 earnings will be good. He said to buy AMD.
"Lots of fear in the market today but for the most part AMD and XLNX are holding yesterday's gains. Today's money is flowing into Energy, Consumer Discretionary and Communication Services. I predict we will be green by the end of the day. Wait for the XLNX AMD merger approval from China and hold on to your seat! Go AMD! Go Longs!"
"Stay calm and accumulate shares. It may be another 9-12 months until the global supply chain snaps back, and when it does..."
Always intriguing how this stock can be up after market and pre but opens down. Just keep adding on down days and hold!
"if this goes over 120 again, it will zoom up to ~140, say in 2 months maybe?"
"Intel 12th generation Core engineering samples LEAKS: frequency is only 1.6GHzIntel Alder Lake 12-generation Core is expected to be officially released in October. The first batch will be three K-series overclockable versions, including i9-12900K, i7-12700K, and i5-12600K, bringing a new hybrid architecture of large and small cores, as well as new Z690 chipset motherboard."
We seen this before! Just a note. Shorting by the Big Boys is still Rampant. So the game continues. That is why Retail Investors Need to Band together to Break the cycle. SEC will not do anything. Why? they are the same people. Yellen Powell and SEC all came from those Brokerages!Just Buy and Hold! AMD is worth North of $130/share! DO NOT let these people control your Buys and Sells.
going back above 120
"This is the value (Aug. 17, 2017-Aug. 24, 2021 weekly price) on my investment with AMD for the last 4 years. Started at $12.43/sh to $107.65/sh, that is 866.04%. Remember still going UP..UP..UP... You will never never get that appreciation to any BANK. Invest LONG TERM. Enough said."
"A couple days ago, some shorties boasted that they shorted their shares @$120, guess what, even if you buy your shares back at @$105, you would make the same amount of money as us longs when the price goes up to $150 eoy, because you'll have to pay a lot higher tax rate! Now ask yourself, did you buy in @ $105? If higher, you are losing money! You think you can outsmart Wall St by shorting this great stock, no, you can't. But you can outsmart them by holding your shares long while doing nothing! Why? because we have the greatest CEO in the semi sector, Dr. Su!!!"
"""Nothing stacks up to Epyc"""
Looks like we are a Nasdaq index fund today. :) Stay strong AMD longs!
"All semiconductors are down. Everyone is saying there is shortage yet the stocks are down. Can someone enlighten me why the semi are down all over the market? Compared to the other semi, AMD seems to be coping well today."
"Rumors of a full unconditional approval from China's SAMR for the ADI/Maxim merger appeared on August 17, and the approval was announced this morning. That merger was originally announced in July 2020--about 3 months before the AMD/XLNX merger announcement.I tried to find out where the ADI/Merger was in the SAMR process--phase 1, 2, or 3--but could not find any reporting about it. There was speculation back in May that approval was getting close, then a rumor in July that it would take longer as some customers were raising concerns. I could not find anything saying it moved from one phase to another. Does anyone know if that deal was in Phase 2, and if so when it moved into Phase 2?In any case, the Phase 2 review of AMD/XLNX has until about the first week of October to be complete, although it can be extended for another 60 days (phase 3). Even so, it could be concluded at any moment if SAMR does not see any problems. Hopefully today's news is a precursor to full approval coming soon."
"Which is undervalued, a note to all, particularly Shorts.....NVIDIA has an earning of $2.79, PE og $80, and todays price of $220 give n take. AMD has earning of $2,89, PE of 35, and currently priced $108.×× Do you see Why AMD has upside potential and should be avoided by SHORTS??? You can thank me later, but if you want to short something, better do Intel or Nvidia."
Can AMD really go to 117 with the call options expiring tomorrow?
My AMD shares are making me rich. How are you doing with $INTC?
"QUESTION: What percentage of AMD's business is in AI?A relative of mine asked me that question, and I have no idea. Do any of you?"
"AMD, has been GREEN, approximately 62%, of all The Fridays this year thus far.￼￼￼￼￼"
"I think Lisa Su is thoughtfully and smartly positioning AMD to be the leading, most innovative, CPU, GPU maker globally. For larger applications such as super computers to our laptops we all use at home. Including not only the highest quality chips but a cost effective prices so everyone can access and afford quality CPU's in their computers. One reason why she is so popular is she has a purpose and vision which includes an increased top and bottom line q/q, excellent business operations overall, but also to add benefit to add positive benefit to people's lives and improve environmental sustainable via leading CPUs in ie. environmental protection equipment and pollution detection devices. Very long AMD, I am holding my shares for years, I see this stock at over 400 plus in years to come. AMD is just in the early stages of it's capabilities and growth, positioned in one of the fastest growth sectors the digital sector, every computer needs a CPU or GPU."
"Okay, it's late in the trading day. AMD has just reached the average daily volume and the share price is near HOD. I've just bought a few shares for my second Roth IRA account. The share price has dropped only about a dime since I bought. So I've done my part. Now let's giddy up, AMD!"
Amd has :1) The Process2) Blow-Out YOY earnins/ revenue Growth 3) Roadmap4) Fabulous CEO Lisa Su5) Merger-With or Without merger AMD is worth Much Higher!So Just hold on for the ride up.This will double in no time
"strong company great products, in fact I was able to buy an hp laptop with AMD chips, works great so far. Having said that it does not matter since the market is a big game."
"“Amazing,"" ""flawless,"" ""superior"" — all words analysts used to describe AMD's results. That is a reflection of Dr. Lisa Su’s personality and a trait of successful CEO."
We just got latest info from our contacts in China that AMD XLNX merger will be approved this week! Congratulations longs!
This is a buy opportunity. We have sector weakness combined with the hot money unwind in AMD. I added at $104.94/share.
Still trying to beat it down while it's still moving up. AMD isn't letting it's momentum be disrupted by the shorties and MM crowd simply wishing it down. The AMD Express just keeps chugging along carrying higher the hands holding on strong. Knowing good news is always pending to keep this tech giant ascending.
"Should Close, about $114.00,after all."
"A 10:10 PM article in seeking Alpha...tonight, written by EnerTuition states in the final few paragraphs a startling estimate for server market share by the end of 2022 as follows:""As customers realize this and re-evaluate their mental image of relative positions of AMD and Intel, change is inevitable. Google’s (GOOG) (GOOGL) recent Tau VM announcement is a good tell. It would be a fair guess that Google has inhouse samples of any server CPU to be launched within the next year and has intimate knowledge of server products beyond 2022. Google has seen the data and has made the decision which way it will bet. Google is making no bones about pointing that AMD Zen 3 EPYC solution is significantly superior to alternatives. Google would likely not make such an announcement and alienate its leading chip supplier, Intel, if it saw Intel making a comeback in the near term.Cloud business is extremely competitive. The server TCO of all the cloud providers is unlikely to be significantly different. For cloud server procurers, there is not much room for flights of fancy to chase losing bets. Other server customers are unlikely to make dramatically different choices than Google did with Tau.Cloud customers will continue to buy Intel server products based on previous generation designs but Intel is unlikely to win many new designs. Accounting for qualification and ramp times, AMD is likely to grow market share well into 2023 and likely 2024. Considering the dynamics in play, AMD is likely to surpass Intel in the cloud in market share in the coming quarters. It is unlikely that Intel will have more than 50% share in the cloud exiting 2022. Rest of the server market will likely take longer to shift to AMD but that too is likely to happen a few quarters later.""End of quote.How bout them Apples!!!!"
started a 400 share position at 109.69.
Think about the mentality that is needed to be a short. A short's investment thesis is based on the hope that a company fails in some way or that people who have bought a stock will lose money. Is there anything more low than that?
OMG it's heading 120 again?
"$111 is where we put the handle on the cup. The number 111 is a message that you are in the right place at the right time, the Magician within you is doing his work, so maintain a positive focus and look for the opportunities that are coming your way."
"This is just the beginning of something big for AMD. Once it takes back its 52 week high that it reached few weeks ago that it so deserve and is able to hold it, that it won't be long to see the 130's and 140's once that marriage with XLNX is finalized before the end of this year. With that said I hope you are taking advantage of these conservative prices while they are still at this levels. Have a nice day everyone and stay safe as always."
Didn't notice this before...The company also reported it had repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $256 million. That equates to $80/share. Nice move Lisa Su!!!
NVDA will be reporting their earnings after the close today and with its history will probably give another strong earnings report which will bode well with AMD and their peers. Both NVDA and AMD have powerful products and services that are needed today and in the future but for investment purposes I have chosen AMD because of its strong management led by DR Su and is cheaper than NVDA. I won't be surprised if next year AMD will grow to a 200B+ market cap. Have patience everyone during times like these because better days are yet to come. Have a blessed day and stay safe as always.
"INTC delayed again - The U.S. Department of Energy is nearing a deal to purchase a supercomputer made with chips from Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc as a key lab waits for a larger supercomputer from Intel Corp that has been delayed for months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters."
Let’s close 111.50 or better and open Monday 114
Never mind Powell hes a drop in the sea of AMD ...pay attention to the 10' o'clock MM CLOCKWORK MANIPULATORS...you can set your watch by them!

"@Mantra Man, Intel $53.89 vs AMD $111.40. enough said. LOL...hehehe"
It's time to mute this @JapanTrader who has been spreading FUD. hehehe
"There will come a point next year where AMD will finally be fairly valued in the $250-$350 range. The chance to ride that coming upside is now. Once it comes, if you're not in it, you missed it and your chance is gone. Same thing with people who didn't buy under $100. Bashers said it would never go to $100. It crossed $100 almost a month ago and hasn't been back under $100 since. The same will hold true for $200."

"Longs, thumbs up if AMD is up more today than the price you bought in at."
"$INTC current Rocket Lake desktop processors are based on the old 14-nanometer process, while $AMD uses the modern 7-nanometer process. As a result, AMD can pack more cores into its processor, making it more energy efficient, and at the same time producing superior performance."
What’s the shortie excuse for today?- Intel took ms from AMD?- Fridays are always down days for AMD?- never break $100?I love the entertainment value on this board. GL to all longs.
