"For anyone who may think that XLNX is any kind of a risk whatsoever, simply compare XLNX's historical performance against AMD's since Sept 1, 1990, since that is the earliest data that Yahoo has for XLNX:XLNX: $1.06 - $156.27AMD: $2.19 - $111.40What a blessing everyone has been given to gain more AMD shares in exchange for their XLNX shares upon the finalization of AMD's acquisition of Xilinx! I don't know this to be factual, but I can imagine that Dr. Lisa Su had to give her approval of this action. Since I believe she's the best CEO around, I have no qualms whatsoever in adding Xilinx to my portfolio. Best regards to all who agree and are, therefore, taking advantage of this rare and wonderful opportunity we've been given."
AMD WITH XYLINK can easily beat NVDA with no ARM!Move your money to AMD!
Morning shake out is complete!! tested into the $111.90 111.60 support and popped. looking for $138.00-144.00 on this leg up.
"It really is so funny to me how Shorts try to grasp hope out of thin air. There's several comments here today about how AMD is RED. Oh noooo. Sky is falling. They no longer can even say it's down 1%, or even half a percent. AMD was down at close 0.07 percent. If one can even call that a down. But to shorts, every little bit of hope is worth hanging onto. I really feel bad for shorts at the same time. Wondering why can't they learn and stop their loss by making a simple change. Buy AMD shares. Just Hold it, at least 6 months. It really is that simple....The, 3mt, 6mt, 1yr and 5 year charts shows you how simple it is."
We shall finally see that $115 today as we've expected for some time now.
"So, I guess the news this morning was not enough to save this stock?"
If they are going to change 1 XLNX share to 1.7324 AMD shares then XLNX should be $194. (1.7324 x 112).
We are confident China will soon announce approval of AMD XLNX merger after CCCS full approval!
All the good news..Can only go In one direction..Gearing up for a nice push higher..Go AMD!!
Still trying to beat it down while it's still moving up. AMD isn't letting it's momentum be disrupted by the shorties and MM crowd simply wishing it down. The AMD Express just keeps chugging along carrying higher the hands holding on strong. Knowing good news is always pending to keep this tech giant ascending.
$INTC was 3 years late with 10nm. Now it's over 3 years late with Sapphire Rapids. End of story.
"CCCS Clears Proposed Acquisition by Advanced Micro Devices of Xilinx1. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore ('CCCS') has cleared the proposed acquisition by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ('AMD') of Xilinx, Inc. ('Xilinx') (collectively, 'the Parties') (the 'Proposed Transaction').2. Following its assessment, CCCS has concluded that the Proposed Transaction, if carried into effect, will not infringe the section 54 prohibition of the Competition Act (Cap. 50B) (the 'Act').http://www.publicnow.com/view/511CE9FD658A83299DA3CD03F6BD039ECCE4E992"
Exynos 2200 (Samsung with AMD mobile GPU) handily outpaced Apple's A14 bionic chip.
"The AMD Trend Remains UP. The AMD Company Continually Gets Picked for ExaScale Computers, the word is out as to who has the best. AMD EPYC Processors Win Out in the ExaScale world of Super Computers. Now just sit back and think about that. That is the Best Free advertising by far that AMD could have. Simply, What computer Builder(large or small) wouldn't put AMD Inside. AMD is like the cream of the crop, Its just keeps Rizen To The Top. The Best Is Yet To Come and as it continues it will be EPYC…………………..ace"
Ain't no stopping us now - we're on the move - HIGHER!!!

"$NVDAAug 29, 2021 15:29 EDT ""NVIDIA Fights To Keep $40 Billion Deal Dream Alive As Foes Join Forces"" ...The opposition to the deal in the U.S. comes as it undergoes extensive scrutiny in the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China. The U.K. is investigating whether the acquisition is a threat to its national security, and China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has also consulted parties that might be affected by the deal, and unconfirmed reports have suggested opposition from Huawei Technologies Ltd.

We just got latest info from our contacts in China that AMD XLNX merger will be approved this week! Congratulations longs!
"Shorts will not be able to hold AMD back much longer! AMD continually has a bullish open then pulls back. Perfect example of shorts protecting their position. AMD will soon breakout, as the company is hitting on all cylinders with incredible leadership. Xlinx (sooner rather than later!), multiple new server contracts, partnerships, etc. AMD is on its way to higher ground! $150+ by year end."
Whoever is short AMD is dead dollarwise when the AMD-XLNX deal is approved by China.. coming in days.
