Split up LB. The parts worth more
Well I guess I don’t have to worry about the covered calls being exercised 
I think this is the best investment on the street right now! In my opinion
"LB: owns Victoria Secrete, bed Bath Beyond (this one doing really well) , BodyWorki see LB will reach 35$ next 2 weeks"
"Thanks - I decided to exit my position today. I don't really see BBW standalone being able to generate much capital appreciation going forward. And VS will never be the brand it once was - not such more their fault, just how society has shifted. No matter the cost cutting, it's a brand that will fade away slowly - I mean it was really hurting pre-covid."
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/victorias-secret-parent-l-brands-will-change-its-ticker-to-bbwi-starting-august-3-2021-07-12?siteid=yhoof2Will LB shareholders get any BBWI shares? Or just VSCO shares?
The founder is desperate to sell and exit this money loosing business. Plus the risk of Jeffry Epstein victims suing and getting money of the founder is a reality.
"I was amused today to see that L brands executives are not going to take any pay during this period when the coronavirus is keeping the stores closed. The bigger question is why in God's sake have they received any pay over the last five years. When this current management took over for Sharon Tuannery, L brands was a $30 billion company. Since that time the current management effectively got paid to lose 90% of its value, incurred declining sales for five years straight, by all consensus failed to change the marketing strategy of the Company for five years to adopt to the changing market conditions and changing market trends. Created an atmosphere or sexual has harassment festered while management did nothing about it. They should not worry about furloughing their current pay, they ought to be sued to recover the pay they received over the last five years which I assure you would amount to several millions of dollars. These executives all made well over six figures in salary per year while shareholders watched their stock decrease in price by almost 100%."
"Can’t wait for next earnings, Christmas is lbrand season!!!!"
Earnings were strong and stock down 10 percent?? I’m very confused!
"Great entry point for this stock in lower 30's.. Quality company going through some transitional times but will turn the corner very soon. Also remember folks, when the next big recession hits (which could be anytime), value stocks like these people will flock to. This will be $60 within the next 12 months IMO.. Patience, hold and collect a nice dividend until things turn the corner."
What the lol
"LB closed its 50,000 sq ft Victoria Secret flagship store in Hong Kong last week. Rumors have it pay early termination penalty of US$ 70 million.https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3090533/victorias-secret-known-its-seductive-lingerie-closes-flagship-store"
why it dropped from $79 to $61? what was the news?
"The craze on the Hertz Rental Car (HTZ) stock has finally ended. Now, Hertz will go through the ""NORMAL"" chapter 11 process and HTZ stock will slowly go to its inevitable destiny: $0, to the dismay of the Robinhood ""gamblers"". Implication for LB: if LB has a poor 2020 Christmas Holidays quarter, then get ready for Chpt 11."
Does LB have some announcements? Why the whole market stock went down 2 days in a row besides this crumbling company?Macy's -7.5%Macerich -5.8%Under Armour -5.2%And only L Brands -1.9%Whats wrong with it? Does someone have any ideas?
LB will be back over $20 in January. One days trading does not determine the price direction for the year.
Anyone know why this is showing an 8% after market pop?
I'm up 12% and we're just getting warmed up. One of the best value stocks going right now.
"BBW worth $14.5bln,it's p/e only 14, plus BBW sales can keeping continues growth,so LB reasonable price is $65 per share,"
buy for long term.
A lot of negative comments but LB is turning around with more enlightened advertising and new merchandising. This is what analysts and apparently customers were waiting for so let’s see if it produces the desired growth in sales and traffic. LB has a loyal customer base and associates. If management listens to them and with the changes already in the executive suite it’s a turnaround story in the opening acts.
holiday decline and cuts guidance and up a lot... ?? Hrm..
told wife their items are a big turnoff to me now. and so is their stock.
"Victoria's Secret parent L Brand stock rallies after Q3 results, guidance"
So JPM now rasing PT to 50 for the 3rd time in several months (35-42-50). At the same time they help LB in raising funds. Just coincidence?
So do the LB shareholders get anything from the VS spin off?
"Wonder who is pulling the strings on this one, after the VS sell off failed, this shouldn't be trading above 10, let alone higher than pre-Covid."
Expectations are way 2 high. This stock is not worth a dime more than $35.
my td acct says this morning JP morgan upgraded price from $53 to $54...?
Cya at $100.00
"Closing stores, extending debt. Costco is selling hand sanitizer in half gallon jugs. Online LB has to compete with Amazon. Debt looms in the long term. Long term survival is risky."
I would not be selling your shares you will get a lot more for them just by waiting. Forecast $2.40 in earnings
"Patience everybody, this is a great buy at these levels. Quality company that is going through some transitional times but will come out strong and results will show... This is not a stock that is going to rocket to $60 anytime soon but will slowly come around in time. Buy and hold for at least 2-3 years, enjoy the dividend and cash up when it's $80 in a few years.."
ok my bet...that was institutional buys
"$LB...LB used to own lots of companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, Lane Bryant and Express. Which were sold off or spun off into their own companies. I’m sure an announcement will be made soon that BBW will be spun off to its own co. without debt. Which will leave LB with VS & 6b of debt. Chpt11 on LB & then the co. just focuses on BBW. This of course the best case scenario. All other scenarios have VS & BBW chpt11."
They should probably stop reporting monthly sales report. This is a roller coaster ride every month before ER
THEY WILL CUT THE DIVIDEND TO 0.30
"Nice news on sales through Sept. 1st....we have major brand recognition and new leadership, couple that with an accelerating economy and holidays around the corner, we are positioned for a nice turnaround.....it will take time so be patient.....go shop at Victoria Secrets, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc...support your investment!!"
"Hasn’t hit it’s floor yet. I’m leaning towards earnings beat but something fundamental in the report that will send lower. Either way, I would like to see it test $33 before I would consider buying it. I think this bad boy has bit lower to go. I’ll buy at $24.87."
LB is a LONG BUY HOLD for me. I would not be surprised if it came up to 50 by years end. Great dividend and shareholder value
Earnings were strong and stock down 10 percent today??
6+ % div companies are special. I can hold till eternity and enjoy the div $$$
"Signet Jeweler (Zales/Kay Jewelers) just announced they will permanently close 150 locations, primarily in malls. Similar stuff will happen with $LB very soon."
"All the negative sexist news stories popping up about VS are extremely misleading. Les Wexner is a stand up guy and a model corporate citizen on the highest level. He severed all ties with Epstein over 12 years ago when Epstein was convicted in Palm Beach for being a sexual predator. In retail it's all about the product. VS product went off track a few years back and since then leaders of VS and Pink have been replaced. VS is once again spot on and women are excited about the new product in the stores. Margins are improving as promotions are declining. The whole store looks so much more inviting. Product is not the most important thing it is EVERTHING.Bath and Bodyworks and Lululemon are in many malls so the theory that the malls are dead is invalid. If the mall stores have what the ladies want they will do very well. Problem with many mall stores is that they could not pivot during the secular change in retail and the arrival of Amazon L Brands will shine again and that time is fast approaching. Product, Product, ProductL Brands is extremely undervalued."
Just talked to my Mom’s cousin who’s been a Victoria’s Secret executive for decades and she strongly thinks LB is going out of business.
$LB I am downgrading $LB to sell with PT $13 due to declining revenue and raising debt and the imminent possibility of dilution.
"Regarding the lease agreements in NYC, that LB is trying to get out of. Why did they never mention who had signed them? What does their internal control system / SOX look like? They appear to be surprised by what contracts they signed themselves. As we say in Germany they are digging their own grave... If they know they have signed lease agreements, did they accrue them for the stores they are closing (as they can´t get out of the agreements - at least without BK)? It also will be interesting to see the Non-GAAP adjustments in Q2 . Furthermore they should revalue the goodwill of VS and potentially others after Sycamore walked away. Guys, they have already approx. 2b negative shareholder equity. What will happen if their inventories devalue, because they could not get sold and the goodwill also goes lower. Remember that the inventories secure the revolving credit line of 1b. Bond holders will start to get nervous. Unfortunately I haven´t seen the bond prospects yet and the figures LB has to guarantee..."
July job report will crush LB tomorrow
"not sure this seems like a good thing. so they surrender 51% to a UK retailer. I think the days of the mall are gone. stores like Victoria Secrets, bath and body works etc, make their mark on the experience of shopping there. online is not the same and cannot command the same high price. I think the end is coming after this holiday season posts extremely poor results for the experience based retailer."
It can taste the 30s
Here again.........a blatant example of analysts' incompetence.........Two day ago.........UPGRADE based on better earnings........and today........lower guidance by company............Why do analysts exist ? Why ? Those high school drop outs should be sent to some factory instead of sitting in A/C'd offices.
"I still don't get this stock...3Q was a ""win"" only because Q1 was Q1 was so horrible. While BBW is up 18.9% for the year, it only makes up 50% of the company. VS is down 34.2%. Net sales for LB as a whole are down 14.4%.So they refinanced their crazy debt, closed some stores, and unloaded their UK to a joint venture - none of that justifies a near doubling of the share price"
I see the changes l brands has done to the l brand product line. From branding to posting new products with specific wording on those product to appeal to the comfort conscious consumer. The wheels are in motion for making appropriate change for the future of the company. Now we wait and see how the costumers respond to the new set of changes.

Finally some positive news from LB. Bringing swim wear back.
"LB brand is clothes maker with retailers , SO inflation Will boost it's sales growth and make more money, strong buy it,"
Somebody call Warren BuffetThis is Way better than some that he owns
Check out $NAKD. Finally on an upswing. And it has the potential to be at least 5x fast due to Meme Stock.This is side action of course. Partial speculative buy. It's the side action from here when LB is going sideways near the top on a holding pattern. Good Luck :-)
I'm not very familiar with this stock however due to how overbought the nasdaq is even the companies that smash earnings sometimes pull back
"The company reported a loss per share of $0.70 for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, 2020,"
"I would for sure not be selling at this price unless you are taking a tax loss , Just by waiting I think you will make a lot more for your share , If any thing I would be buying the dips bcause it's worth a lot more than it's now trading for."
"They don't have any moat, and numbers are fake. Retail is worst now, and anyone making numbers by hiding real labor costs, and rents etc. They are sending employees to state coffers, and showing progfit. It's a trick by non-gaap."
"This stock is likely to go to ZERO (i.e., bankruptcy) under nearly all realistic economic scenarios (except a highly unlikely V-shaped economic recovery). The only reason that it is not below $10 right now is stock price manipulation."
"I am looking at LB as a possible investment. I like the large dividend of almost 8%, and the drop in stock price to a more attractive level. However, the negative book value ( shareholders equity) is quite disturbing at -$3.46 per share. I would ask those investors/posters who follow this name to explain why they are ok with this."

It’s time for Victors Secret.
Up 3% afterhours to $30 and once the market opens down 4% to $27.70.... apparently the after-hours market doesn't know what it's doing.
"CFRA MAINTAINS SELL 10:11 am ET May 21, 2020 We keep our 12-month target at $8, 6.7x our FY 21 (Jan.) estimate of $1.20 (cut from $1.54), LB posts Apr-Q wider-than-expected loss of $1.07 vs. $0.14 EPS, missing consensus. Sales decreased 37.1% to $1.7B, missing consensus, with better results at Bath & Body Works (BBW), which benefitted from stockpiling surge of sanitizers & soaps (one-off boost, we think) and continued under-performance at Victoria's Secret (VS), which has struggled to reposition itself to 'what women want' and a business segment we expect to see an accelerated pace of closures and an eventual bankruptcy. We reiterate our view on balance sheet concerns (debt levels to rival JCP) and our high level of uncertainty on how BBW will navigate a Covid-19 world when stay-at-home orders are lifted, given high exposure to malls and reliance on store testers, which allows for showrooming -- a large part of brand's success. (We note ULTA has removed testers for stores.)"
Upgraded this morning by Merril/BOA to neutral from Underperform
"Let's see, the company posts horrible numbers again, VS brand is all but dead, my gosh they even cancelled their runway show to save money. The Bath and Bodyworks brand is the only thing with any value and it sells candles and towels, it is merely an upscale Bed, Bath and Beyond without the lifesize cutouts of Laurie from Shark Tank. I never short stocks and am highly invested in retail, but let's get this straight, the same analysts that are trashing companies like ANF, AEO, SIG, KSS and M are pumping this dog. I'm sorry but this is merely analysts getting together to try and pump the price of the stock so they can get their high wealth clients out of it without losing any money because they invested so much money chasing after bras and panties. Probably with the exception of JCP and PIR, the least likely of the retailers to see another Christmas and that assuming they spin off BBW and try to sell VS to another retailer who incorporates it into their line up of private label products, they won't get much for it though. Just more evidence that Wall Street is corrupt. They pumped up Five Below, they pumped up Children's Place, they pumped up Ulta, meanwhile all of them flopped this season, meanwhile they trashed ANF, AEO, SIG and M and they all reported well, all are up thanks to better than expected pre-announcements."
"Didn't expect it to drop $3, what a market."
"I am wondering, not to say amazed, option expiry doesn't seem to have any influence today. Open interests are huge. Some people will really be hurt today. From fundamental perspective I actually believe LB should be priced between 5 and 10 USD..."
"LB is undervalued, yet its near 52 week high.At risk of buying high I took position today, because of the Victoria’s Secret spin off in August.Planning to hold a year or more."
"I said this before and I’ll say it again, there are sooo many amateur shorties here that think this stock is TESLA or something....THEY MADE money this past quarter and have so for the past quarters....they lowered guidance, this the stock drop, but THIS is NOT going bankrupt...go check out what happened to LULU when they hit a slump and dropped to $40 a share....and what happened to RH when they got hit a couple of years ago with dissapointing outlook and dropped to $27.....please check those stocks out and what the result was??? Go short TESLA a company that LOSES money quarter after quarter.....LOL"

"I bought this for 30.87 a few days ago, normally if I get a quick 10% profit I will take, but I’m going to hold out for at least 20% on this one."
About a 10% share buy back is underway.
That VS fashion show is as tired as the super models with wings. Too far gone with today’s old leadership at LBrands.
This company only needs new management. As soon as they announce a new CEO will soar to 30's
"Bought, 15k, this is a compelling price to enter"
Over sold pe X only 12 others are 18== LB should be at $35
"There is pretty sizable Open interest in Jan 10 $19 Calls.There is also sizable Open interest in Jan 17 $17.5 Calls, $20 Calls, and $17.5 Puts.It seems like there is a big bet on LB price movement (BBW spin off news?) in the next week or 2."
"agree, market is down over 1.5% and LB is up over 6%???? What gives."
"thought $33.88 would be the bottom and bought more, and here new low came again. WTH. Haven't sold a single share yet. What a bag holder I am."
I have a feeling anyone who was thinking of buying today and doesn't is going to regret it next week.
"lets see, made 37 million a year ago stock was 27, lost 49 million this qtr. stock 29 hmmmmm"
$LB Time to buy; part of the year where VS and B&BW blooms. Would bounce back to $50; warranted ! http://alph.st/b905b6a4
L Brands got me feelin like El Chapo
"My wife's track record has been spot on.. I just bought a position based on her feedback. Told me the store she goes to is always packed. I've been looking for stocks that have a low PE, and pushed down.. so I'm thinking this was a pretty safe bet."
I’ll be honest guys I got stuck with puts so I hope it goes down just for day then you longs can have your time
"I'm so confused... they had a horrible quarter, just slightly better than the horrible quarter expected, but all the stories are about a profit and a beat. They are down in every parameter and far from any profit."
"Will you get both Victoria Secret shares and BBWI shares from your LB shares? If you have 100 shares of LB, how many shares of Victoria Secret and BBWI will you get?"
After the bell tomorrow we shall see.
started accumulating at 37 and thought that was low. added more today
Triple the buyback program and guided 20% above consensus. The 20mm share placement is bought back 10mm within the buyback. This quarter looking to be good.
LB needs new management team...
"Hi investors of L Brands!So I had decided to post this essay here because I know that the older generation remains into using Yahoo Finance. But as what I wrote went way past the word count I decided to post it on Wordpress & then just give you the link to it. But what I wrote basically explains why analysts are very mistaken in disparaging the company’s brand as the problem. As Victoria’s Secret never had an advertising problem. The only problem they had, and still have although to a lesser degree since Mehas came in, is a product problem. But I hope it’s of benefit to you guys & also to Mr. Les Wexner who I think is such a truly talented business man who just needs to listen to his own heart. (As opposed to the hysterics of people who aren’t even Victoria’s Secret’s customer base.) Because fashion is at its heart rooted in fantasy. And fantasies are timeless. And there’s a reason stories like Helen of Troy, & Cinderella, & Aladdin, & King Arthur, etc. never get old. And so how could the concept/narrative at the heart of what made Victoria’s Secret such an iconic brand ever become passé?  But anyways. Hope it’s helpful. And lots of love!(Link: https://forlbrandsandinvestors.wordpress.com)"
LB WILL GO TO 25 THEY WILL CUT DIVIDEND
"60s soon,here we come"
It was only $35 three months ago. I won’t touch till it goes to $40!!!
Lb- nuts to buy at this price today
"Decent buy here. Deep value. VS has their problems, but a global brand this cheap doesn’t come around too often. They’ll get it sorted out. Time to start accumulating."
One thing that some investors are ignoring is that these guys are very conservative in their reporting. Victoria Secrets had a 4% increase in sales without adding many new outlets but they are reporting flat to down sss. The reason is that unlike many other retailers that have been combining digital/direct sales with store sales to juice the per outlet number these guys have not. While Victoria secret store sales are flat direct sales are growing at over 20%.
The dividend is not safe
"JPM & GS hired to fix the business, so more expenses. They will try to pump, as JPM said in the start."
"Why spin-off is the solution. BBW is a great growth company generating 1.5 billion EBITDA in 2020 should be trading at 12 times EV/EBITDA or 18B$. If we deduct 4B$ debt we get to 14B$ equity value or 50$ a share.VS is a 7.3B$ sales company with 0.4B EBITDA. It is declining for 4 years generating just 4-5% EBITDA compared to 20%+ in 2016. This business should be traded without debt at max 4 times EBITDA. This is 1.6B market cap or ~6$ a share. Total value is 56$!Now the spin off is extremely important managerially - VS management has to fight to get it back on track. They have to be aggressive and reduce cost by at least 10% starting with rent, logistics and overhead. This will stabilize the CF.VS today is relaying on BBW CF and this is wrong!"
"Well well well, Limited Brands will come back to 2005 which is last time the stock sold at these levels. It's hard to put in words or fathom how badly management has Destroyed this company and screwed its shareholders. This company has now lost close to $30 billion of market ap In the last 3 years which equates to about 80% of its value. For the last 3 years I have listened to virtually every earnings call to hear management state ""we are committed to increasing our profits 10% year-over-year. And in this timeframe not only have they failed in their they would have managed to see the company's profits decreased almost 50% during that time. I was reading an investment note regarding L Brands this past weekend and the author mentioned something which I think explains the continued slide in the stock. He noted, that even though the company's sales at Victoria's Secret have been sequentially falling virtually every quarter, the company has made virtually no changes in the stores over the last 3 years. In other words, he commented, that they are selling the same stuff that they sold 3 years ago and have made virtually no substantial changes to the marketing concepts or target market strategies. In short, there is nothing that will stop this freefall at this point until current management goes.. I would encourage each shareholder to write to the company's Investors Relations, titleholder, Amy Preston, express the frustration you have with the fact that the company has faltered this significantly over this shorte period of time. And that the current management seems unable to address any issues to solve the problem.I'm particularly disturbed bywhat I perceive is the Board of Director's breach of its fiduciary duty to the shareholders. As a result of their constant support of the current management, the Board of Directors has an independent duty to evaluate its current management hires and I fail to see how the Board has done this in any of the last 3 years. If they had, they would never have continued with the current management. All I can say, is that if I failed asmiserably as current management has at my job, I would no longer be employed. No if's and's or but's about that ..I think it's time that shareholders should seriously consider some type of class action against the Board of Directors for breaching their duty and failing to exercise their independent judgment regarding the management of the company, something needs to be done to correct the situation before everyone loses everything. I find it interesting that the one analyst who had been predicting a target price in the mid-20s back when the stock was selling at 60 has now adjusted his target price to the mid to low teens. Unfortunately I think it's inevitable that the stock will get there pretty soon, that there will be another dividend cut, and that the current management will continue in their positions. If you are interested in this possible type of action against the Company please let me know in the replies below"
Time for a change at the top. Les runs the ship and in 3 1/2 years the stockhas declined from 95 to 18. It has to fall on top management
"I don’t own LB, but I’m thinking of buying. My wife and I go to the store at Bridge Street in Huntsville Al regularly. I have to save a space in line for her because it is always so busy. I know our local economy is on fire and some stores in certain areas are suffering. I like the brand, I don’t think this will rank very much longer."
"I’m not a holder in this company, still on the watch out for the right price tho, as it just looks like it has more room to drop. However this dividend yield is becoming a concern. Seems like it needs to be cut. Also, if LB is primarily BBW and VS, yet only half the business performs well and the other drags, the side that drags should either be worked on improving or spun off or sold. Thoughts?"
"I was in a Victoria Secret in a terminal hub, there were 0 other costumers there. It seems as long as covid is around their store sales are next to nothing. Does L Brands have enough cash on hand to survive the comming years? If I read the earnings it will be a tough call."
"LB should look to enter/add the yoga wear sector for growth, IMO."
Have to say I am surprised with this recent trend upward and return to pre-corona levels given the negativity swirling around. opportunity to add to my short position as feel this has some way to fall in coming months
Interesting spike in volume into the close and a large block of calls that expire this week were purchased too. Perhaps there is some good news coming and someone knows something.
"what? how can people sleep? Scam analyst, scam management, etc"
Long term we will be rewarded. Just stay the course. Great brand recognition and consumer has confidence. Good combo
"well, established a 10k position yesterday........ great timing, feels good man"
Bought more at $32.02. Thank you after hours sellers :).
I just muted mr pocket...95% of comments just disappeared.
is there news driving this price action? seems up a bunch prior to earnings. were their estimate revisions?
Royally beat expectations. $1.13 reported versus $0.06 expected. $3.06 billion versus $2.67 billion expected
All retailers seem to be doing well in sales. Hopefully beats on revenues and guides upwards.Has potential to go up 5-6 $ ( with reduced tax burden )My opinion and i trade stocks daily
It is time for the CEO and executives of LB to purchase stocks of LB at this cheapest level to show support for the price increase.
Sycamore is wood. I guess the wood continue s in this pending acquisition. Sycamore portfolio is Staples and Talbots and of course the closed retail Limited Too.
"In the end VS gets 60% of the buying market in their stores, any business owner will tell you getting customers in the door is half the battle. All businesses need to reinvent their brand after long periods of time. Now you’re betting they can or can’t reinvent their branding with their massive store and online presence."
The difference between LB and Macy is M had a clear cut turnaround plan and owned some very valuable assets. I suppose you could say VS brand name is a valuable asset. So what's missing is the turnaround plan. I think its coming but it could very well include a dividend cut and that's going to move the stock down at least 20% from here if that happens.
L Brands is up 5.17% to 73.64
"I usually do not tell people to get out of a stock, but for this one, I will say that. What they did with Victoria's Secrets is insanity."
"LB will record more cash flows going forward - VS when spun off will be more focused. Store shopping will increase as the economy opens up post-Covid. Specifically, interest in looking ""desirable"" will increase as consumers feel more ""alive"" which should increase sales revs for VS. Focus on Bath and Body Works will also go up. Overall LB should go up in value at least another 20 - 30% easily."
Earnings out in an hour!! Very excited. Very long LB. it’s 60 stock in a year
If there was ever a company that needed to have its ENTIRE executive staff slashed....>THIS IS IT. Bunch of old duffers playing a game that worked in 2000
don't forget ex-div for $0.60 per share on June 1st. Lot of folks will probably buy even more shares then after it goes down possibly as result of the current day's earnings report.
Why don’t that 90 year old Les step down and give it to a 40 year old woman?
"Note the volume today (or lack thereof) and you will soon see we are inching towards the last throws of pumping by institutions waiting for the precise moment to exit. LB is not a Value stock, and certainly not a Growth stock. Based on the reality facing this company (declining revenue, increasing debt, mall exodus, and no pipeline of new products) the only direction remaining stock valuation is not favorable to any long term success."
Selling after an upgrade? Looking forward to the financials coming out this quarter.
"Surprised LB is down only $1.45 per share, since LB just cut its Dividend by 50%, DOWN to $1.20 from $2.40."
"Really bad misses and no guidance, surprised this isn't under $10 right now"
Just got in this morning at 32 even. Hard to resist a bargain here. Thinking this company would be attractive to someone smart who would take it private.
"The stock has been PUT heavy for quite some time - the conspiracy theorist in me tells me that's why the stock has been moving up. I sold out in the high 20's and have no regrets (used the money on PINS).Remember SHLD? Such an easy play right? Even if you bought LEAPS they kept the stock up for YEARS. We all knew it would crash and burn, but some people can keep things afloat longer than you can stay solvent. In any case that's why I'm glad LB is in the rear view mirror for me; I'm only buying stuff that is trending up for good reason."
"Bought $50 Call option today at $1.23 50 contract , I am thinking may be good entry, hoping to see at $3.5 per contract. Good luck guys 15 days to go"
Bac raised tgt from 29 to 33 underperform to neutral-more to come.
"Jack, you don't suppose Lynch, BofA and Wells Fargo were the ones buying those call positions do you? In other words, once they pump the stock to their in the money zone, they will stop pumping it, so you better enjoy the ride while it lasts. Wells Fargo also shorted Signet before coming out with a major price target drop and downgrade. It appears that many of the underperforming analysts are trying really hard to start the New Year out with a bang and hopefully secure their job for another year."
I long 5000 shares... have lost so much in the past 6 month ... Hope they are good numbers. X fingers....
When Sycamore is involved its a fire sale
Dividend looks safe. Great entry point
Strong company. Women will always buy from VS. I see this stock being 55 in next 45 to 60 days. Tons of upside at these prices. Exciting time to get In before earnings in my opinion
LB is up 4.96% to 35.74
"just listened to earnings call. same thing for lastr three yearsa. ""focusingng on customer"" .Nothing new management is worthlesss"
"Forget about bankruptcies, forget that a fall may occur, you need to invest all the money in the stock market, the more you invest, the more you get. The rule ""growth does not occur without falls"" no longer works."
Definitely a buy now!
This will hit $40's again after the earnings report tonight. I expect to beat GREATLY as usual. Good track records!
Since the Mass majority of women nowadays are overweight in addition to adding plus to obese size lingerie Victorias Secret should also offer fast food gift cards free with each purchase. Or maybe they could just give free giant sodas and hot dogs with cake at the entrance of each store.
Nice move today
"Wife and friend went to VS and Pink the other day because of a sale. She came home with a ton of stuff which was great...however, the sale was so huge, she ended up getting $200 worth of stuff for $60. How can any company survive by providing such deep discounts and giving stuff away. People just don't want to pay $50 for that bra, but when it gets discounted to $30, they will. Profits will be hurt by this."
Please read to the very end when it comes specifically to LB:https://uk.advfn.com/stock-market/stock-news/82631273/landlords-sue-stores-for-unpaid-rent-wsj
"Had this stock for 7 years, so glad I kept buying on the way down and didn't bail. I'm curious if they will ever pay a dividend again or just use the money to reinvest."
"This company has a 47% payout in dividend which is safe a product which is declining in sales but is still needed, and has a booming lotion business that is growing and has to be replaced every so often. VS will eventually find a bottom not every one I believe will get there undergarments over the mail. I’m wrong so far hope to be right in the future."
Did anyone see that Wells Fargo analyst made a upgrade to LB with a big PT (price target) change for LB today? That analyst is now rating LB as Outperform and PT bumped up from $30.00 to $55.00.
why has this been going up so much this week? I don't see any real news besides the CFO retiring
Don't just blindly follow Jeremy.
Lb- over bought
"Hi guys, the Americans. We in Russia do not understand what is happening, why is paper growing? How long will your President drive the market up? Before the election? Paper should not cost so much, the price is higher than before the crisis. Bad report, bankruptcy, closed stores. This is all a dream."
L Brands (NYSE:LB): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.88 beats by $0.02; GAAP EPS of -$0.70.
Buy opportunity
"Im calling it now. Down 7% at open and up 10% at close. Ive seen stranger things, and not just the show, haha."
10 bil debt...how are these shares over 20?
LB reached a 52-week high!!! Up we go!!! GO LB GO!!!
My wife spends 150 a month at this store...so I had to look at the stock....I may invest in the company...to get some of my money back :)
Is this Jeremy’s largest position?
time to go private...
This company has over 9 billion in debt. Victoria secrets sales have dropped significantly that's why sycamore backed out of the deal. LB book share value is at -6 yes that's negative 6. Strong reversal ahead watch and see.
"LONDON—The British unit of Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands Inc. filed for protection from creditors Friday as it grapples with disruption wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic, in a move that could result in the sale of the business.L Brands is invoking a tool in the U.K. called a “light-touch administration” that, like filing for bankruptcy, creates a moratorium on claims for unpaid debts. But unlike in a bankruptcy filing, it allows management to keep running the business with the consent of administrators.So let the stock go further UP, amen"
Look at what they are willing to pay for interest!https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/l-brands-turns-to-bond-market-after-victoria-s-secret-deal-dies
Here she comes :)
"Seems like LB has placed the bonds. As you can see following the link below, the bonds are already trading below 100%... Interesting!https://www.boe#$%$-berlin.com/index.php/Bonds?isin=USU51407AB77https://www.boe#$%$-berlin.com/index.php/Bonds?isin=USU51407AD34"
"for those, who believe in LB please take a look at the SEC filing and compare GAAP vs presented Non-GAAP:- GAAP: actually another 50m USD are lost (several restructuring positions were used to come to a positive Non-Gaap result- the ""positive"" FCF and cash&cash equivalents in balance sheet are healvily influenced by the new bonds and the simply fact, they did not pay their bills (I assume mainly rents) >400m USD; increase in current debt >400m USD; lease liabilities approx. 170m USD; and the new bonds, which lead to an increase of long term debt by approx. 800m USD.- at the same time Good Will and the value of trade names were untouched. Especially for VS there will have to be a big write down at the end of the year- all the debt etc. has to get paid by less sales in the furture. furthermore LB states concerns for Q4 sales due to logistical restrictions regarding traditionally higher Q4 volume. They want to spread the higher sales volume over longer time. Unfortunately they want to see part of those sales in Q3 already. If they are actually pulling sales forward, this is a major point if those sales actually can be reflected in Q3 P&L (matter of sales recognition). It will be interesting how they want to explain, why customers are buying Christimas gifts early this year... At least they would have to spend much more on advertisement in Q3...This just as a little warning! I would not wonder if investors are going to sell of sharply until Friday"
Did we reach the bottom yesterday because we recoup half the losses yesterday?
The company is focusing on international growth and not focusing on domestic growth. I don't see why people are worry. This stock is a no Brainer. Get your dividend and stop worrying about the price. Long term holder are not worry.
It is crazy that LB with FE/S of $2.45-2.70 and div of $2.40/share trades at the same price as AEO with FE/S of $1.7 and div of $0.55/share
why is this doing so well today when everything else is down? It is all on no volume too.
Took a position 5 months back and since then I am only averaging down.
Why is this stock down 3 percent today when a stock buy back is announced plus feb numbers were released and they are up 11 percent. What am I missing here?
"The biggest uncertainty on LB is whether Sycamore Partners would withdraw its $550 million purchase for the 55% of Victoria Secret business, citing force majore. If so, then LB is ""back to square one"" on its restructuring strategy."
Is Jeremy in any winning trades besides ELY?
"why. brand name is not an easy thing to build. on top of that, Amazon is not going to sell women bra and take free return all the time. at this price with that dividend, lb is not that bad."
"Bank of Nova Scotia reduced its stake in L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB) by 74.8% in the second quarter, according to the company in its most recent 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm owned 21,977 shares of the specialty retailer’s stock after selling 65,286 shares during the period. Bank of Nova Scotia’s holdings in L Brands were worth $329,000 as of its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
does anyone actually believe the dividend won't be cut?
Manipulation at its best! I can’t believe it got to the $14.80s. Wait until everyone realizes there is no acquisition and more stores close. Even Bath and Body will struggle with Covid worries. This is an $8 stock at best.
"Who would have thought selling lotions and candles would be such a big business and at the same time, be able to offset losses from a failing business. Never thought it would happen."
"If you’re looking to start a position in L brands you should do it sooner rather than later. Victoria’s Secret is an iconic brand and if other retail companies like old navy, gap can survive this long that should tell you VS has a long life ahead of It’s self. After all VS and L brands is catering to women, the people that still enjoy going out shopping."
$25 1st target...
Earnings prediction? Think we see a nice beat and how will the market react? Many companies beating earnings and raising guidance only to see share price drop. This stock does not follow the traditional path by any means. Hopefully some more positive spinoff talk and and a healthy xmas quarter will push this into 40's.
I invest on what I know and see around me I believe what drove the stock down over the past years was millennials not buying name brandshowever the younger generation is all about brandsbrands brands brandsI like the dividend and I'm going to entry into this stock I can see this stock popping back up.
earnings?
this is about to plummet when they use the new models.
New here.... is it time to BUY LB at this level in time to get the dividend?Will this stock ever rebound?
"If you are still investing in LB after last year, you are hoping they do something drastic to help the company, mainly VS. VS won't magically just become relevant again without something big happening."
Spin off is comingBBW worth at least 15B$...that is 54$ a share.
my ex-wife was just let go after 30 years from victoria secret---her stock is all she's got. Should she hold it for 30.00 pps? Or should she sell now? She's in shock. Please answer this. TIA
$40+ by eoy
Victorias Secret needs to bring back some of the styles that were popular in the past. And offer plus to obese sizes.
This is the lowest point in past 5 years. Have they not added any value over the past 5 years?
Should have shorted at 14.80. Didn’t pull the trigger. Thought it would go higher.
CNBC: LB intends to sue Sycamore for breach of contract. “It ain’t over till it’s over!”
The selloff on the dividend cut was a joke. There is no reason they should be paying a 6% dividend but I'm glad because it gave me a change to get back into the name. I think a really nice rebound in the brands and strategy going forward will serve all investors nicely.
"Rosie Huntington Whiteley, Flavia, Adriana Strong Brand Sky High Dividend The Balance Sheet Is Improving This is a $60 stock at least"
"buy buy buy, for the longer term."
"Shrinking margin is a concern , however 7 percent on dividend payout . It’s a buy at this price near 52 week low before earning . I bought today . Should have invest Tiffany last night prior to earning ."
They had some interesting insights about BBWI on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
22 coming in few months
just bought some 28.20
LB is getting hit the hardest during this store closure crisis! 79％ of closures turned to be permanent! The reason is that their business fading actually started much earlier before COVID-19 which is just accelerating its business collapse!
They need to get their products to the influencers on youtube. Nothing says earnings like some good old fashion sponsored reviews posing as genuine
"The previous CEO sold $300,000,000. All his stock. That says it all."
Big over reaction this will be 50 by end next year!
this really likes hanging around $33. I'm a bit shocked at ita resilience compared to the rest of the market
"What a disaster. It's hard to believe that three years ago this was $100 stock with most analysts having a price point. Of $120 or more on the stock. From there decision to stop selling swimsuits to their inability to react to the current market trends, it's hard to put in words how horribly the management has performed over the last three years. They took a company with a dominant market position and destroyed it losing close to $20 billion in shareholder value in the process of doing so. And yet, the Board Of Directors sit silently and keep renewing the management contracts of the current idiots. The board needs to be sued for breaching its Fiduciary Duty to the Shareholders by retaining the current management year-over-year. And someone better do it soon, before the current management finishes off the company completely and destroys the company. The dividend has now been slashed, there is no growth in the core business, there appears to be a complete inability of management to make any meaningful changes, there is simply no reason to invest in this company. I'll tell you what, I have lost enough money in the stock that I can be a bona fide ""Plaintiff"" in a shareholder breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit. I would be interested in seeing what others on this forum think about this concept. The Board needs to understand that shareholders will not sit idly by any longer while they do nothing to turn the company around other than renewing existing management's contracts. Which obviously has not worked. Post your thoughts below. I know there are several security as attorneys who would be interested and willing to take the case. I have already explored this issue. The reality, is that management has consistently misled shareholders about its is suppose ""turnaround"". I think management has also misrepresented constantly the impact of his decision to stop selling swimwear had on the company and its sales. I remember three years ago Lest saID at some conference that he ""should have stopped selling swimwear years ago"""" and that getting rid of the swimwear would allow the company to get more profitable higher-margin products in the stores. Well, that did not work very well. Did it?"
2008 the stock was at $9.00 lets hope we get there. Why you ask the massive margin account calls of the decline of equity in those accounts and ETF selling also. Sell or lease back HQ. Maybe add a Chic FLia drivethu.

CEO stepping down VS for sale. Yahoo
What’s risky is wearing VS to my house
"So, stores are closed. Sales are sinking. And the price is like it's November 2019. Okay"
Is it time to buy puts on this thing? You can buy Jan 21 $5 strike for 0.25 (going 20x if stock goes to zero). Is that good risk reward?
LB can blame the braless trend for sluggish sales.
"no longer L brand is VS company. now only a soap company. is this worth for market cap of $7B business of selling soap? nope, I don’t think so..."
If you own the stock you would be wise to factor in a dividend cut. Its definitely on the table and at least a 50% or better chance it will happen. They have one of the most recognizable brands in the world but they need the time and cash flow to reposition the company. But if you expect the dividend to hold the stock up its possible your going to be hugely disappointed. In the long term I agree the company has the brand recognition to make this a great value play. The thing that really boost that thesis is how negative the analyst are right now......That's the only good thing going for LB in the short term imo.
% Held by Institutions 82.13% ; They are dumping left and right.. I bet it Tests $40
"Senior Mgmt needs to be fired and replaced for this company's abysmal performance. No clear strategy, a stubborn commitment to the current B&M business model and a lack of innovation has cost shareholders billions of dollars in market cap.I hope on of the activist types starts buying shares of this dog and forces change."
Someone sell me on buying LB today...Price at $41
It doesn’t appear they’re going to let this go below $25.50 today. Seems like an insane run up for this news. What do you guys think will happen tomorrow?
"If you need help in deciding to buy or sell....Insider James L. Bersani sold 28,373 shares of L Brands stock in a transaction dated Tuesday, September 1st. The shares were sold at an average price of $30.00, for a total value of $851,190.00."
Just bought more
I was in the store Sunday it was packed long lines at registers but they had plenty of help ! Also well stocked hope it sells off in earnings I’ll be adding more !
"Ouch shorts - enjoy the heat. when the market is down 300 points and LB is up by 16%, we know what to expect when the market turns around."
Stock is getting ready to tank. LB was up on news of an upgrade from MKM. But a bad stock up on news always sets up for a deep dive. Volume is 1/3 normal amounts. Sellers will take less as they seek to get out with what profit they can.
