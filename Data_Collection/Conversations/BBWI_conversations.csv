"for those, who believe in LB please take a look at the SEC filing and compare GAAP vs presented Non-GAAP:- GAAP: actually another 50m USD are lost (several restructuring positions were used to come to a positive Non-Gaap result- the ""positive"" FCF and cash&cash equivalents in balance sheet are healvily influenced by the new bonds and the simply fact, they did not pay their bills (I assume mainly rents) >400m USD; increase in current debt >400m USD; lease liabilities approx. 170m USD; and the new bonds, which lead to an increase of long term debt by approx. 800m USD.- at the same time Good Will and the value of trade names were untouched. Especially for VS there will have to be a big write down at the end of the year- all the debt etc. has to get paid by less sales in the furture. furthermore LB states concerns for Q4 sales due to logistical restrictions regarding traditionally higher Q4 volume. They want to spread the higher sales volume over longer time. Unfortunately they want to see part of those sales in Q3 already. If they are actually pulling sales forward, this is a major point if those sales actually can be reflected in Q3 P&L (matter of sales recognition). It will be interesting how they want to explain, why customers are buying Christimas gifts early this year... At least they would have to spend much more on advertisement in Q3...This just as a little warning! I would not wonder if investors are going to sell of sharply until Friday"
LB needs new management team...

"Note the volume today (or lack thereof) and you will soon see we are inching towards the last throws of pumping by institutions waiting for the precise moment to exit. LB is not a Value stock, and certainly not a Growth stock. Based on the reality facing this company (declining revenue, increasing debt, mall exodus, and no pipeline of new products) the only direction remaining stock valuation is not favorable to any long term success."
Earnings prediction? Think we see a nice beat and how will the market react? Many companies beating earnings and raising guidance only to see share price drop. This stock does not follow the traditional path by any means. Hopefully some more positive spinoff talk and and a healthy xmas quarter will push this into 40's.
I would not be selling your shares you will get a lot more for them just by waiting. Forecast $2.40 in earnings
"Hi guys, the Americans. We in Russia do not understand what is happening, why is paper growing? How long will your President drive the market up? Before the election? Paper should not cost so much, the price is higher than before the crisis. Bad report, bankruptcy, closed stores. This is all a dream."
"Thanks - I decided to exit my position today. I don't really see BBW standalone being able to generate much capital appreciation going forward. And VS will never be the brand it once was - not such more their fault, just how society has shifted. No matter the cost cutting, it's a brand that will fade away slowly - I mean it was really hurting pre-covid."

"no longer L brand is VS company. now only a soap company. is this worth for market cap of $7B business of selling soap? nope, I donâ€™t think so..."
"CFRA MAINTAINS SELL 10:11 am ET May 21, 2020 We keep our 12-month target at $8, 6.7x our FY 21 (Jan.) estimate of $1.20 (cut from $1.54), LB posts Apr-Q wider-than-expected loss of $1.07 vs. $0.14 EPS, missing consensus. Sales decreased 37.1% to $1.7B, missing consensus, with better results at Bath & Body Works (BBW), which benefitted from stockpiling surge of sanitizers & soaps (one-off boost, we think) and continued under-performance at Victoria's Secret (VS), which has struggled to reposition itself to 'what women want' and a business segment we expect to see an accelerated pace of closures and an eventual bankruptcy. We reiterate our view on balance sheet concerns (debt levels to rival JCP) and our high level of uncertainty on how BBW will navigate a Covid-19 world when stay-at-home orders are lifted, given high exposure to malls and reliance on store testers, which allows for showrooming -- a large part of brand's success. (We note ULTA has removed testers for stores.)"
My wife spends 150 a month at this store...so I had to look at the stock....I may invest in the company...to get some of my money back :)
"Why spin-off is the solution. BBW is a great growth company generating 1.5 billion EBITDA in 2020 should be trading at 12 times EV/EBITDA or 18B$. If we deduct 4B$ debt we get to 14B$ equity value or 50$ a share.VS is a 7.3B$ sales company with 0.4B EBITDA. It is declining for 4 years generating just 4-5% EBITDA compared to 20%+ in 2016. This business should be traded without debt at max 4 times EBITDA. This is 1.6B market cap or ~6$ a share. Total value is 56$!Now the spin off is extremely important managerially - VS management has to fight to get it back on track. They have to be aggressive and reduce cost by at least 10% starting with rent, logistics and overhead. This will stabilize the CF.VS today is relaying on BBW CF and this is wrong!"
Have to say I am surprised with this recent trend upward and return to pre-corona levels given the negativity swirling around. opportunity to add to my short position as feel this has some way to fall in coming months
"lets see, made 37 million a year ago stock was 27, lost 49 million this qtr. stock 29 hmmmmm"
