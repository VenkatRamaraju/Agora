By now we should of all figured out that the move to 100 was pure manipulation so Ingram could do his offering. Otherwise he wouldn’t of been able to get it done. And with plenty of capital to complete 9001 it was just a “if you don’t like it sell my stock”moment. So we are back at the top range of where we should be. I expect that over the next few weeks or days 70 will be easily taken out. There’s no catalyst to own this. It’s an excellent tax loss candidate Earnings are in a couple weeks but has the stock ever rallied after earnings. And these announcements that Doug hypes are usually not huge revenue producers So if you own this like me and made your purchase over last 4 years then you made a bad investment Would love to hear the bull case going into the end of year if there is one
adjerk....enjoy the 70s while they last
"look at ""L"" with its first 2 profound posts! solid work!"
adjord20 hours agoFor you ChattyAre we still on target for your 70s prediction by Friday?
"So the offering price to the public was 81, but the company only got 77.35 Why would investors pay 3.65 a share more than management itself thinks it’s worth"
kimster will be saying the same things even if the stock hits single digits... kims a paid pumper...EOS
"Not sure if there were comments on this board a couple of months ago when the FDA released their PDUFA VII performance goals letter but it's as if it were tailored specifically to Sarept. 3 key takeaways as follows. 1) ""Enhancing patient-centric drug review, such as the incorporation of patient-centric data into drug development and regulatory reviews and supporting safety monitoring."" 2). ""Supporting the next wave of advanced biological therapies such as cell and gene therapies and facilitating broader use of novel trial designs and approaches for rare and ultra-rare diseases."" 3) ""Modernizing regulatory evidence generation and drug development tools, such as advancing the use of real-world evidence for regulatory decision-making."" Pretty hard to read those and not come away with the perception that the FDA and Sarepta are in lockstep. The antagonistic days of Chris G. are long gone..."
All these posts about how wonderful the new offering is? You guys seem to think you know more than the market. So far....nope.
Only in Kim land is this a good thing
Just zero reason to buy Sarepta here Hoping for a little bit of a run into earnings so I can take my loss and try to keep it at less than 250 thousand. I have zero confidence in this company and their ability to actually make money. It’s Sarepta university. Trying to help kids with no worry ever for investors
"The 301 trial is on the clinical trials site, days away from dosing kids. This will become a confirmatory trip for the mixed application from 101,102,103. The drug will be approved by AA, and get full approval based on the 301 results, US and EU."
"Cathy laughs at my 200 prediction but think about this, If all the Placebo kids get better from baseline , show a change in trajectory for the better, there are no new safety signals, and the biological markers are in line with the first 4 kids and the numbers we saw from the first 11 103 kids this will blow thru 200, without a look back."
where's kimmy??
Now lower than the drop in January I’ve said that Sarepta is in penalty Bosc for a year But to do it purposely is a different story Defend this Kim
Kim u need to answer DBPOMS statement
papa....77.... next stop?
"There are 2 things the FDA is afraid of , approving a drug that turns out to be dangerous, and NOT approving a drug that has benefit. DMDis a 100% fatal disease, but that is not the end of it. Kids without any treatment live miserable lives, their legs cramp and ache all the time, they can't sleep, they need constant care and supervision. Everything gets worse as they age. A treatment that alleviates any of these is a treatment the FDA will approve if it's safe. Janet Woodcock said to a group of DMD advocates and patients"" If this drug(eteplirsen) shows any benefit no matter how small we will approve it"". Take a look at the data from the treatment kids in 101,102,103 and tell me there is no benefit."
"Artisan Mid Cap Fund, managed by Artisan Partners, explained their position on Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) in their Q1 2021 investor letter. Here is what they had to say:“We ended our campaign in Sarepta Therapeutics. Sarepta Therapeutics is a leader in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug development. Shares were pressured during the quarter amid a disappointing clinical trial outcome for its DMD gene therapy. We believe the odds of FDA approval for this therapy are lower and the timeline longer."
kimmy....
Best for everyone on this board to sell and move on. There’s tons of better investments than Sarepta now
