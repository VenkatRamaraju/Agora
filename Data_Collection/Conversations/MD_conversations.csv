Mednax is a very poorly run company. They take 50% of doctors earnings and now they are asking for doctors to cut their pay in this pandemic. The good for nothing administrators who don’t even see patients take the money and are making hard working physicians and NPs to suffer. Horrible way to run. Their physician satisfaction is worst. Over all poor company.

Blackrock is manipulating the stock and the news. Anyone buying should be wary as it is for certain a pump and dump stock. Blackrock almost certainly acquired its shares under $10.

"My wife of over 30 years, Jacki died of Ovarian cancer, but this cancer could have been prevented if she was NOT bullied by her boss Carey Osborne at MEDNAX. I recently found a confession letter that she left me describing how Carey bullied her to the point that she was petrified of taking any time off for vacation or medical checkups/procedures. It seems that Carey always gave Jacki a hard time for any vacation, medical appointments for her or her elderly parents. MEDNAX is an awful Company to work for, totally incredible the lack of professionalism, human care, and empathy at MEDNAX. During her fight with cancer, she received a dismissal letter from MEDNAX after 20 years with the company with a registered letter. After 2 months from her death, she got almost 2 weeks pay of leftover sick time pay, but her boss would NOT let her take any time for medical needs!!! Stay away from MEDNAX."

Mednax is forcing their physicians to cut their salary - and calling it voluntary. This company is in serious trouble. They are acting like dictators. They are talking about Covid but if a company cannot survive one month of covid - shows serious mismanagement. It’s so unfair to ask doctors and NPs to cut their pay when they are fighting for their life to save people. These leechers take 50% of their Practioners money and then mismanage and then now talking about sacrifices from Practioner. They have no morals. This company is going under.
Looks like it may start up from here.
