Blackrock is manipulating the stock and the news. Anyone buying should be wary as it is for certain a pump and dump stock. Blackrock almost certainly acquired its shares under $10.

MEGA DILUTION AFTER HOUR = BACK BELOW $50 WITHIN DAYS ...Thats the reason for the pump fraud just to raise money at better price dont fall for it guys .
Mednax is forcing their physicians to cut their salary - and calling it voluntary. This company is in serious trouble. They are acting like dictators. They are talking about Covid but if a company cannot survive one month of covid - shows serious mismanagement. It’s so unfair to ask doctors and NPs to cut their pay when they are fighting for their life to save people. These leechers take 50% of their Practioners money and then mismanage and then now talking about sacrifices from Practioner. They have no morals. This company is going under.
What happened today ? Does anyone know any news ?

"IT support staff was recently “ 3 weeks ago” all completely outsourced, got rid of all the expert seasoned IT personnel for all nationwide remote offices and all hospitals. Will be interesting to see how IT support of all systems will be handled without the years of experience and knowledge."

"My wife of over 30 years, Jacki died of Ovarian cancer, but this cancer could have been prevented if she was NOT bullied by her boss Carey Osborne at MEDNAX. I recently found a confession letter that she left me describing how Carey bullied her to the point that she was petrified of taking any time off for vacation or medical checkups/procedures. It seems that Carey always gave Jacki a hard time for any vacation, medical appointments for her or her elderly parents. MEDNAX is an awful Company to work for, totally incredible the lack of professionalism, human care, and empathy at MEDNAX. During her fight with cancer, she received a dismissal letter from MEDNAX after 20 years with the company with a registered letter. After 2 months from her death, she got almost 2 weeks pay of leftover sick time pay, but her boss would NOT let her take any time for medical needs!!! Stay away from MEDNAX."
"not sure where all of the buying came from today, but clearly the stock is overvalued here. they should do a quick secondary share offering here and take advantage of the uptick today................"
