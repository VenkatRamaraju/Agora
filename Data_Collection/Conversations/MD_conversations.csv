Can someone explain how a cash business like this with $500MM in yearly earnings and a market cap of $1.5B is not attractive? That's a P/E of 3

Warned that this company is ridiculously overinflated. I rarely post unless valuations back up my statements. Overpriced above 12. CHTR similarly way overpriced.

Loading up long term real company got take advantage of any covid related dips .
"My wife of over 30 years, Jacki died of Ovarian cancer, but this cancer could have been prevented if she was NOT bullied by her boss Carey Osborne at MEDNAX. I recently found a confession letter that she left me describing how Carey bullied her to the point that she was petrified of taking any time off for vacation or medical checkups/procedures. It seems that Carey always gave Jacki a hard time for any vacation, medical appointments for her or her elderly parents. MEDNAX is an awful Company to work for, totally incredible the lack of professionalism, human care, and empathy at MEDNAX. During her fight with cancer, she received a dismissal letter from MEDNAX after 20 years with the company with a registered letter. After 2 months from her death, she got almost 2 weeks pay of leftover sick time pay, but her boss would NOT let her take any time for medical needs!!! Stay away from MEDNAX."

Blackrock is manipulating the stock and the news. Anyone buying should be wary as it is for certain a pump and dump stock. Blackrock almost certainly acquired its shares under $10.

"IT support staff was recently “ 3 weeks ago” all completely outsourced, got rid of all the expert seasoned IT personnel for all nationwide remote offices and all hospitals. Will be interesting to see how IT support of all systems will be handled without the years of experience and knowledge."

"Should I get my eyes checked?? MDR is UP pre-market!! Looks like MDR may, just may, be leveling off. If you haven't bought yet, think I would start TODAY . . . but scale into your position, as Mr. Market is only one tweet away from a shooting war in HK and the Gulf . . . plus there's the Mooch's new ANTI-Dumbster stance (was WH spokes-model for 11 days; former Skybridge founder, and semi-billionaire) - THE FIRST rat to abandon the Dumbster Ship."

Mednax is forcing their physicians to cut their salary - and calling it voluntary. This company is in serious trouble. They are acting like dictators. They are talking about Covid but if a company cannot survive one month of covid - shows serious mismanagement. It’s so unfair to ask doctors and NPs to cut their pay when they are fighting for their life to save people. These leechers take 50% of their Practioners money and then mismanage and then now talking about sacrifices from Practioner. They have no morals. This company is going under.

Mednax is a very poorly run company. They take 50% of doctors earnings and now they are asking for doctors to cut their pay in this pandemic. The good for nothing administrators who don’t even see patients take the money and are making hard working physicians and NPs to suffer. Horrible way to run. Their physician satisfaction is worst. Over all poor company.
