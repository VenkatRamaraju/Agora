Massive Accumulation just as I mentioned few days ago. On the cusp of a major relationship coming up . . . We're gonna see this break 100 faster than thought.
Has any one look at stamp.com.insider trading and checkout who is selling and is buying and the trading dates. this will explain or all.
"I'm curious about the operations at this company. If they totally dropped the USPS, are they not processing/mailing any packages? How can they even be operating? Or do they still use USPS but are looking for additional carriers? Not really understanding what's going on. Also, what motivated the decision to drop USPS? I know last year the news that Trump wanted to clean up USPS was shaking things up a bit. Or are these the questions that everyone else has, too?"
It's important for the CEO and management to put out news on strategic partnerships soon.
"LARGE OWNERSHIP REVEALED, SHAW HEDGE FUND. SEE SEC FILINGS. THIS THING ABOUT TO SOAR."
"Something strange is going on, the MA chart show an uptrend, it looks like this price does not match the charts, the stock should be going up by now."
"Several questions linger in the minds of investors. If the company provides more clarity will instill better confidence. I hope in the upcoming earnings call, the analysts will make effort to ask questions related to1. Breakdown of revenue streams (instead of lumping) providing more visibility into revenue and growth opportunities in each of the stream2. How much revenue is still expected from USPS via indirect means (from integration partners as the direct part is no longer present since the company walked away from it) and the visibility of this revenue continuing into the foreseeable future especially the company had earlier identified such revenue exposed to the risk of future USPS re-negotiations (in Risk factors section of the recent 10K published)3. Probably related to Q2: Any of the integration partners such as IntuiSHIP going though or impacted by similar re-negotiations with USPS?3. Status of the class action lawsuits against the company and any exposures thereof4. Status of progress related to company's efforts to find new revenue stream to remedy the lost revenue from direct commission part from USPS(via partnerships or new products or new acquisitions)5. Share buybacks: How many shares were bought after the company announced share buy back in march6. Potential credit card fee increases: Will there be any sizable exposure to revenue expected coming from credit card processing fee increase to merchants by Mastercard and Visa (or can such cost be passed to customers without impact)7. How are the existing customers taking the subscription fee increases - any impacts to customer retention from fees?"
"I’ve owned this stock over 20 years! Finally paying off live I knew it could. Have more shares now than have ever held since bought and sold over the years. Yes, happy day. If I wasn’t already retired, I would be now! Congratulations to all stockholders of STMP!!"
These comments are wrong and do not reflect Stamps strategy of entering the vastly expanding shipping business both in the U.S. and globally---and their new and growing business connection with UPS
"Recent 3/3 analyst George Sutton target of $340. And Maxim $405. Sutton noted that NRF and USPS data indicates FY21 online retail growth of 18-23%. I think stock is down with post-Covid selloff and lack of guidance, but online sales are here to stay and growing, making great profit margins, plenty of cash, low PE and float. Technically, extreme oversold. Strong buy at these levels."
Well a year of pain led to a 20%+ return. I'll take it.
Are we supposed to sell the stocks now (to take the profit) or keep them? Appreciate your input.
Why would an investor sell now? In 5 yrs growing eps at a 20% clip puts the pe ratio down to 7 so we're looking at a $400 stock in 5 yrs with a pe of 14. Good luck.
BEATS LICKING STAMPS. Read article on STMP ShipWorks new product for Warehouse. This is the vision that company has had for long time but does not explain well on conference calls. High volume shippers can now just scan barcodes to make shipping labels and computer will give them all shipping options at once so they can pick carrier with lowest price. STMP will make money on every package sent. Even if margins are squeezed the volume will be huge.
This is why it went down todayhttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3442853-stamps-com-cfo-call-leaves-maxim-concerned
Nice UP on guidance both on GAAP net income and Net revenue. Nice move UP AH. 260 soon in Nov-Dec.
"Stamps announces pending settlement of securities class action lawsuits, expects to pay out $66-$77 million in cash:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001082923/000108292321000060/stmp-20210528.htmTJ"
What's going on here? Huge drop after-hours...but no news ….at least none that I can find.
I have an online company and ship tons of packages through shipstation which is owned by Stamps.com. STMP way oversold here. Get in before it's too late.
The people posting the negative/short thesis comments please explain why the company would voluntarily decide to walk away from an exclusive deal with USPS? NO company walks way from an exclusive deal that is currently making them money to walk from the deal and have to cut forecast UNLESS they have something in the hopper.
"This is a pretty good analysis/summary of STMP. I'm still long, despite the trivial random unsubstantial negative opinions. There is no good reason for it to be down, and countless reasons for it to go up. I've yet to hear from anyone with any good reason why it is down. This is the ideal opportunity to buy, since the kids lucky enough to be doing the wrong thing at the right time are driving it down:"
SEC filing just out—Blackrock now owns over 15% of STMP
"It's difficult to say this but I was wrong on STMP. I thought the CEO was sincere when he said in the conference call that the company was in ""Advanced negotiations"". I and others thought that meant a new partnership or few may be pending and were looking forward to a news release at any moment. 31 days later after earnings/cc, no word from the CEO or anyone in management. I am beginning to think that was just a Trump type phrase such as after the mid terms the middle class tax cut will be passed. Obviously, neither the CEO nor management care about investors and keeping us informed."
"The only resoning for this big drop is the fact they made some statements that the pandemic leaves questions on performance for the remainder of 2021,.... and the fact they didn't give future guidance.I bought STMP the last time they had a big drop after a good report. And I'm adding today. Their fundamentals are glowing and the PEG shows nice future growth possibilities.It's a BUYING OPPORTUNITY."
"A strategic move that created a catalyst of an oversold scenario of utter confusion, just may be a buy of a lifetime. Hope we don't gap up in the morning or I may have missed my chance."

"What makes this company's products so competitive? Now that everything is reopening, printing your own stamps is not quite as big a deal. They don't look to be cheaper than competitors and I don't hear glowing reviews about their customer service either (average at best). The only thing they seem to have going for their future growth prospects is their target market growing with the growth of small cap businesses in the last 8 months and they seem to advertise more then their competitors. Am I missing something??"
So it seems Monday should be a turnaround as they stated their share repurchase program is going into effect. Watch out shorts will cover.
"Visit Stamps.com Twitter and facebook pages.The rake rate may have changed but it appears that the USPS relationship is still there. Since STMP was looking at a loss of $150 million in revenue, I would have to say that the continuation should result less revenue loss. Higher revenues and possible new partnerships could be a huge boon for STMP. Here is what it shows on Twitter.Stamps.com @StampsCom Feb 27Morehttp://Stamps.com customers can continue to buy and print all USPS Services. Additionally, http://Stamps.com will continue to offer USPS rate discounts:"
it seems to be going back up
"Can anyone explain how Cash on B/S went from $444M at Year End to $567M in Q1 w/ only $44M in Operating Income for the quarter? Further, add'l $27M in share repurchases.....Does the increase in Cash have to do Stock Based Comp. somehow?"
Went long today! 1800 shares at $35.03. This week is a steal at these prices if you are a long term contrarian investor!
Why pay attention to risk factors cited in the 10-Q statement. Might be a good practice for any stock to go over it. Seems Stamps.com had highlighted the risks with the USPS negotiations way back in Aug 2018. https://www.amenityanalytics.com/blog-articles/sec-filing-analysis-identifying-the-risk-factor-in-stamps-coms-drop
"Never have I seen a company's stock get so severely punished based on a strategic decision made by management.STMP's management knows a heck of a lot more (than us investors) about where future growth is and sometimes short term earnings can take a hit for a better future. Way overdone to the downside. USPS will still do business with STMP, but now competition enters the picture. It's likely STMP will retain a large percentage of their existing clients."
Steady and stable upward movement up today keeps STMP marching to 210 shortly. Liking the move here. Not jumpy but slow and steady small moves - good sign to stabilize and start the upwards trajectory on a firm footing.
Selloff was a gift. Way overblown. Management would not leave USPS unless there were better opportunities.
"Hey ""Eggs""? You're absolutely correct; ... they've ""misrepresented"" everything; and avoided talking about any ""Positives"". (And ""they"" do this all the time. I'm retired; but was a ""Portfolio Mgr"" for 45 years. Those ""guys"" are a ""joke"" in my opinion; ... and never really had any respect for any ""Info"" or ""Opinion"" they would provide. And it's recent article you read is a perfect example!NOTICE they didn't even mention STMP's ongoing ""BUY BACK PROGRAM"" (Currently about $40 Million.) PE is rather high; but not when looking at the anticipated PE a year from now. You would almost think they were short the stock. Oh; and let's not forget previous ""rumors"" of a ""Takeover"" which at the time was Shopify. (One might argue should they now try and make a bid for the company with the price now so much lower? WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW OTHER SUITORS COME IN AND TURN IT ALL INTO A ""BIDDING WAR""! Walmart would be an excellent ""candidate"" for acquiring STMP. Even AMAZON just might be interested one would think? Wouldn't that be nice? Anybody out there remember Nabisco?I, not so long ago; ... besides the position I owned? I was Selling $35 ""Puts"" believe it or not!Don't think of selling. Adding to position; ... and Selling 3-month ""Covered Call Options"" against the ""New Shares Added"" is an attractive way to add on to one's ""Position"". Those ""Out of the Money"" PREMIUMS on those ""Calls"" are extremely attractive! Check out the November $280's/$290's!)Have a nice weekend ""all"". scott"
"Only 1.3 million shares traded after hours so far, and you have 3.1 million shares shorted which is 18% of shares shorted, it would be hard to believe that they wont crash this in the morning, sorry to hear about everyones losses"
"Profit taking after huge run, guidance maintained rather than raised, probably because of the USPS customer postage deal set to phase out end next month. Overall great report, and might give some like me an opportunity to add more of this one that favors the challenging covid setting.Anyone know what the USPS phase out costs us in revenue ? Guess I will read the transcript tonight and find out."
"The more i investigate about yesterday's earning report, the more i am amused to see this unexplained selloff...1. EPS double than the estimate2. The company reduced debt to zero (huge plus) and increased cash to $443,552,0003. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 96 thousand shares at a total cost of approximately $20.8 million. From August 11, 2020 through February 5, 2021, we have repurchased approximately $40.0 million under a $40 million total repurchase plan. On February 11, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan which will commence on February 22, 2021 and which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $60 million of stock over the six months following its effective date.There is not a single decent reason for such a huge selloff. Based on the strong fundamentals i have increased, in fact doubled, my position with this selloff..."
"STMP down today partly due to a Lier named Jeremy from Zacks Research. Saying STMP had a ""disastrous quarter"" and ""lost"" its deal with the USPS is UNTRUE. They had a blowout 4th quarter and made a strategic decision to end the exclusivity part of their USPS arrangement so they could pursue other ways to grow revenue and earnings. Short term pain for long term gain. That simple."
This trades at 19x earnings. Are people suddenly going to stop sending packages when the covid numbers come down? I think not!!This should be 250-275 range easily.
"Nice balance sheet...far more money in the bank than overall debt. They consistently low-ball earnings estimate and beat them handily, so EPS of $5.15-$6.15/share in 2019 is a low estimate. Opening new revenue streams is a big plus, and a 20% short position on their float can make this go up very nicely on any news of new partnerships and earnings beat. I'm in at around $83/share. It was very high in the 200's, but taking it down 70% simply due to a strategic management decision makes no sense."

Closing over 100 today should put this on track to cross 150 this week
"In reading over the transcript it's almost as if management is making a subtle invitation to be taken over. Like the opened a window of opportunity for an Amazon, Walmart, UPS, Paypal, Shopify, etc. to come inand make an offer while the stock price/valuation is in neutral, meanwhile the cash on hand is growing and the future long term is as bright as ever. Did anyone else get this idea? I mean all kidding aside, it seems like everything is good at STMP except the outlook is sketchy trying to anticipate the buying power and business volume in a post covid setting. Financing rates are low and everyone has raised capital at premiums, meanwhile STMP has no debt, alot of cash, and is sporting a PE of 19, with suspended guidance. Hello."
"Shopify is finally catching up with $AMZN on the logistics side! Their ePostage system is up and running and churning out millions of USPS shipping labels!!Recall that it was Amazon which was the first company to implement the new ePostage system in 2012. That eventually allowed them to cut out $STMP a few years later. Shopify is following the same playbook, initially integrating with Stamps/Endicia's Label Server for its built-in shipping platform starting in 2015, and now, slowly but surely, developing their own system to remove critical dependencies on outside technology vendors.Sources:http://postalnews.com/postalnewsblog/2012/02/21/amazon-to-begin-using-epostage/https://www.endicia.com/about-us/press-room/20150928Good luck to everyone!TJ"
"For those wondering whether to sell or hold at the current level: So the 330 buyout represents approximately 2% premium to it's current trading price of 323. There is a 40 day allowance for higher offer. 40 days is roughly one ninth of a year. 2% compounded 9 times equals a roughly 20% rate of return. Now we need to discount the 20% for the risk of the offer falling through, but we also need to make allowance for the potential of a higher offer. In my opinion, they're roughly the same leaving me with a 20% annualized rate of return to hold.You may use different approximations for discounting the respective downside/upside risks, but 20% rate of return should be the baseline.Note: Depending on their price, it may be possible to combine put options with owned shares to create a breakeven position in the event of either standard buyout or deal falling through, leaving only the upside of a white knight deal."
Love seeing a 70 handle 80 would be better and then onward from there. Good luck to us longs.
"Today I am out of my long position fully and decided to continue holding my long put options. Seems the stock is drifting back to test its low from its dead cat bounce. A difficult market is making it even more difficult for this weak stock which is getting whacked so badly. Guess the weakness is mainly attributable to the forward guidance where lot of uncertainty is cited by the CEO in the first quarter earnings call besides a much lowered GAAP EPS projection for 2019 on the low side $1.15/sh and on the higher side $2.56/sh. This is not only the issue, IMO the bigger problem is non visibility beyond 2019. The CEO has stated the uncertainty beyond 2019 in his own words. ""Although, we do not provide guidance beyond 2019, the current U.S. proposals, as we currently understand them could also result in additional meaningful reductions in margins earned by resellers in 2020 and '21. This in turn could have a significant impact on our revenues and earnings in those years."" Given this kind of guidance how to value this company based on the forward EPS where earnings attrition is expected beyond 2019? Market P/E adjustments are always based on a stock's future earnings expected. The earnings growth this company was used to in 2018 and before has disappeared unfortunately. With no growth and uncertainty faced, can we assign market PE around 16? - perhaps not as the S&P as an index does not have the forward earning attrition issue faced by STMP. So one would think much lower PE multiple may be on the cards. Looked at Pitney Bowes which is operating in similar space without similar problems and it has a super low P/E. Even if the market becomes generous and awards market PE for the midpoint of the EPS projection it would be about $30 for the share price. So in summary, it makes me think this stock is headed much lower than the low it saw after the earnings unless the company is able to pull some rabbit out of the hat. (Disclaimer: Please do your due diligence. This is only my opinion based on reading the earnings call transcript and the guidance given thereof and I could be wrong for all that in my interpretation as several things can happen in stock market beyond an individual's control)"
"Tried to post earlier-didn't appear for some reason. From the 10-K link (https://investor.stamps.com/static-files/242ce2c8-4b9f-4e7d-a9c5-0519cdb89c38), page 111/166, section 14 subsequent event there is a mention of the date Dec 31 2018 as the date on which arrangements with USPS ended while negotiations were ongoing. Anyone read this section and have an impression?."
"Market will have to interpolate the meaning of the net/net conservative guidance for Q4.Q2 and Q3 were such huge blowout quarters mgmt and markets are spooked about Q4 andwondering how much holiday activity might have been pulled forward and thus exxageratingQ2 and Q3. On top of that you have a huge market runup to digest and a trend when stocksare selling off on great earnings, and no serious talk on stimulus."
"Bull Flag. Market Makers trying to put the stock to sleep, but sellers are not letting much go. If we trade through 64 fireworks will begin. Short this stock is dangerous here, any partnership and overnight this could go up 20-40 pts. T"
"A long history of low-balling EPS guidance. Last year the beat every quarter, and by a lot. 25% overall and 39% in the final quarter. Now we have guidance set at around $5.50/share. Probably a worse case scenario. Very little debt and plenty of cash, plus so many opportunities to expand their business now with their hands untied. If Stmp can forge the business relations they anticipate and get EPS up over $12/share (fewer outstanding shares with buybacks), we'll be wellover $200/share again."
Next Wednesday after the close is their confessional While I think they will easily best the numbers it is guidance going forward that is the concern. This is when MGMT HAS TO!!!!! say something to calm fears and turn negativity around. Good luck to us longs. We can only hope they have something positive to say.
Do we know any dates for buy-out/pay-out?
"STMP went from $70/share in July, 2016 to $270/share in July, 2018 (it Can happen again). Only having a USPS relationship had their earnings clearly plateauing and management knew this. Thus, they had to open up other opportunities and take a short term hit to earnings."
Pressure of selling ! But Hold my shares tight and feeling to add some more .
Such a weird selloff. I bought more. The results are awesome. Eps came almost twice of the expectations. Cannot understand that lack of 2021 guidance is causing this sell off.
current price definitely doesn't reflect the success of STMP! TTD beat only $0.82 price went up $200 in a day from $647 to $847. STMP beat by $2.47 and it's going down! Don't sell your STMP shares less than $350!
A solid earnings and improved guidance will spike STMP to the moon. I think STMP will close around $105 - $109 after ER. Happy Trading!
“We crushed earnings and estimates” Huge drop.
"‘Stole” a few shares under 203 today, strong recovery with no chart breakdown. Expecting 215+ tomorrow if the market behaves. GLTA"
"In March, when $STMP was trading at $175, a bozo stock analyst named Bruce Kamich wrote that ""I agree with (Jim) Cramer's advice that STMP should be sold. All the charts and indicators spell trouble ahead.""https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/stamps-com-return-to-sender-15606210That advice didn't work out too well, did it?TJ"
Why is this stock so manipulated?? It appears undervalued to me... what am I missing?
"While it is very frustrating that no new partnerships and for that matter no news has been released from the company since the earnings conference call, if you want to feel better about the company then I suggest you visit the twitter feeds of Shipstation, Metapack and Shipping easy (all subsidiaries of STMP). Those three twitter feeds are very active."
"Earnings will be interesting since go-shop expires on Aug. 18, ....2 weeks after earnings."
The word leaking out is . . . Amaozn plans to plug Stamps.com services into their small business and merchant payment portal. Huge win for Amazon and stamps will benefit immensely.PUSH 100 today and 200 by the announcement
"I have read the conference call 2 times, and have concluded that it was a solid quarter. All segments were up, except the small postage division ( down 8%). The 3rd quarter is seasonably the weakest quarter that they report, the 4th quarter is seasonably the best for obvious reasons....Christmas,I believe Wall Street has thrown out this stock with the “bath water” as a “growth stock” like Amazon, but STMP has a PE of 18.53 PE, while AMZN has a PE of 128. I think it is a value AND a growth stock. They also addressed the Trump Administrations changes, and indicated that it would not seriously affect their earnings. I truly advise everyone to read their conference call for better clarity.We may have to be patient, until the next quarter’s earnings"
I think Stamps could be up for a big price surge. 3 Months into the new signing of UPS and looks like quite a high Short Ratio of 9.66. means there is a lot of betting that it is not going to hit its expected Q4 1.03 EPS return. I think we might be pleasantly surprised.
"I just happened to look up the insider stock purchase/sale action. Generally speaking, insider buy is a very good sign since insiders will only exercise their stock options if they think the stock price is going to appreciate while selling may be due to various reasons. However lot of insider sales immediately after exercise compared to amount of stock still held by them needs to create some questions in the minds of the investors either new or existing. I checked the following website for STMP stock exercise and selling actions of the top executives of stamps.com. Notably the top executives Chairman & Chief executive officer (CEO), Chief financial officer (CFO), President (retired as of Feb 2019), and the chief strategy officer (CSO) within the last couple of years compared to the latest stock holding holdings. https://fintel.io/n/us/stmpYou need to click the green square with an arrow pointing above to the trading action for each of the above to see the exercise and sale dates. I took a piece of paper and wrote down the amount of shares exercised versus amount sold and remaining shares for each. While I can share that, I am sure it is better left to each individual to do the homework to appreciate much better. Again I do not know the accuracy of the data presented by this website. Actual data can be verified from the form-4 filed with SEC which is publically available information. Please go ahead and check for yourselves as it could be one of the important data points in investing/trading. Good luck to all."
look what happened to Steinmart today. Stock pops over 50% immediately after announcing kiosk partnership with Amazon. If STMP smart will do deal with Amazon shipping which is looking to grow. Believe amazon wants to ship far more than their own products. They want to pose serious challenge to FDX and UPS. Steinmart on verge of going under and Amazon partners with them. Don't see why they would not want to become preferred shipper for Stamps.com platforms
"The saga of Stamps will become a cautionary tale and and urban legend. Within a 3 month period, investors lost 80% of their investment. CEO McBride had the USPS as their main and most reliable customer. This relationship threw off great earnings. But McBride had a ""Let's make a deal"" moment: he dumped the plow horse USPS and took what was behind door #2. He hoped it would be disruptive and smart AMZN logistics. So far McBride has got nothing. But shareholders have a huge loss."
"finally a up day out of the support area, and still no one here lol .....this needs to get back in an uptrend to draw some attention and buyers.....trying to hold some support but no volume to get it moving up , one or two sells and it drops $2-4.....that said one or two buys sends it up just as fast......let it decide to break one way or the other here...still not a buy until it breaks resistance at 50DMA , if it can get there again"
"It's not how much money you make, but how much money you can keep through investment, how hard it works for you and how many generations you keep it for"
"I needed the money and sold all 1500 shares at $127.00 after hours, good luck to all longs."
This thing seems to tank after a every earnings report regardless of how good the earnings are.
I'm heading to lunch at the Porsche dealer. I think this is going to close between $104 - $112. Happy Trading!
Short interest at 2.827 Million shares still. Seems the shorts are taking it into the earnings as earnings call isn't very far away. Either the stock goes spiraling up if the company comes with a positive news or into a nasty tail spin. Which would be it? ?It would be a very interesting earnings to watch.
"Stock repurchase could lead to a buyout, but it's not guaranteed. However, what are opinions on a realistic buyout price?"
They repurchased 40 million shares in last 6 months and approved another 60 million.....nice!
as an active trader I gotta tell u a buy like this comes around maybe once a month
"My post exactly 60 days ago on this board, look it up.Bellamaxi2 months ago$STMP conversationLook for private equity to start sniffing around here or the appearance of an activist player."

"The numbers were great, AH is usually a game played. Tomorrow at 9:30 Eastern Time will show the truth, if the stock opens Red, execute The Company's Board."
I call this another consolidation day which could be a positive that we are only 3 points from the most recent high but again volume is non existent at 385K. Earnings are on Nov 7 so 2 weeks till then but would love to see another deal announced even a small one if not FDX or AMZN which is having a very bad afternoon based on earnings. Good luck to us longs
"Some of you in here are way too emotional. Stocks are a waiting game, this attitude that a stock must turn a profit everyday is removed from investing fundamentals. Did you buy the dip? Good, now wait. Did you hold through earnings? Too bad, you should still hold until you can get your money back."
Congrats longs
STMP is consolidating for now which is good. Making higher closes the last few days. I'm not trying to pump just see this moving back up slowly over time. I did dollar average my position back at 37 so sticking with it for now. Good luck to us longs have a great weekend.
52 week high: $285.75 Simple fact is the CEO is responsible for the current price of $80.35. I can't blame him for the decision to end exclusivity with USPS but to not announce something to replace the lost revenue with should directly result in his firing. No excuses. Smart people find and accept a new job before giving notice to their current employer. 285.75 => 80.33
FY20 guidance suggests about $1 EPS next Q. I suspect management is sandbagging. They have $20M in stock repurchases they want to do by year end and want to hold the price down for that.
"NO WAY the CEO turns down being exclusive to USPS unless another deal opportunity was presenting itself...""The breakup came after Stamps.com said it no longer wants to be exclusive with the Postal Service, terms that the postal service refused to accept, McBride told analysts. Stamps.com said it was looking to work with other carriers such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.""We will no longer be exclusive to the USPS and that's non-negotiable,"" McBride said on the earnings call.""Our customers can no longer survive on just the USPS, and we don't see that as a viable option for the next five years,"" McBride said. ""So basically that was our premise, is like, no matter what, this company can no longer be exclusive given the trends in the shipping market."""
"$358 is the average analyst price target, they just blew out earnings and raised across the board and we are approaching the busiest online shopping season of the year. Serious no brainer here."
Ppl were laughing at me when i bought a 120 call and 125 call. Thing is ppl don’t understand that you don’t necessarily need the price to actually go to 120 to make money. Im already in over 150% profit and im ganna hold for a little while. STAY STRONG LONGS
Guys looking for a genuine opinion. I bought at a higher price with a good amount of shares. Are there any possibilities going up after 22nd Feb onwards once buyback starts? or shall I move to other stocks?
"I wonder how much more stock is out there with 35.04 conversion price like those shares sold by insider Buerba today. That is dilutive and doesn't raise cash for the company. Insiders back selling again already. At some point maybe a Carl Icahn type will step in and deliver some shareholder value for the common stockholders, not just an insider handout program that fills the coffers with cash and builds a wall around the C suite. No guidance ??? No insider buying, only stock option handouts that get liquidated before the ink dries."
"94.5% of stock owned by Institutions and Insiders which leaves only 1 million shares.Short interest just increased 12% to 948k shares. Won't take much to drive a big jump. From a technical perspective, MACD just went positive. Black Friday/Cyber Monday #s could be the driver."
"Perfect time for a buyout rumor or addition to Reddit buy list, naaaaa, I'll wait for for the upgrades after earnings release."
https://www.secform4.com/ It may be a very good idea to consider publicly available insider trading information when investing in stocks. This is a boon our law makers have given small investors by mandating such information be disclosed via Form4 filing within 2 days of an insider transaction. Never ignore this important step. It will be a quick 10 min exercise to check your favorite stock holdings on what the insider perspective is.
"Sooo no guidance, but share $40m repurchase completed & new $60m program added ---hmm I think they are telling us its undervalued by buying back; but waitdiluted share count went up 2m shares yoy, 17m to 19m....how are share counts increasing when shares are being repurchased.....share based compensationIf you are going to treat investors this way, you could at least provide an outlook for the next 12 months. I think that is warranted with running a business with public investors"
I just found out that today is the day that the company and its employees can sell stock and options. This could be a reason for the drop. A lot of inside selling to collect some money lol
I am loosing almost 65% of my money.What should I do at this point?BuySellWait
"Down on good days, really down on bad days...."
I am holding out some hope that another company will put in a higher offer....we will see.
"Any ideas for the 10 point jump in 5 days? Yes the market is up big, but Stmp does not always follow the market"
Sorry about your loss. Tough to know when to sell when we're in free fall....I still believe in the stock's fundamentals. Fortunately I bought low enough that I can ride this out.
Big google trends for stamps. Nobody is going to post office.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=stamps.com
"So much negative sentiment on this board, the shorts have come out of the woodwork. You know what that means? Time to buy!"
Showing good relative strength today. Move to $220-$225 in the near-term looking possible.
Still don’t know how this is below $400 ?????! US Postal service so backed up that it’s delivering Christmas presents this week. Amazon buys used planes from Boeing....
Does anyone know the exact time CEO McBride is expected to speak today?
"Per revised guidance, 2019 eps is down 23 pct, but the stock is down 44 pct. it may reach $60 with in a week."
?? Surge near close (above buyout price) 
"STMP was about 60% into their Q1 when they made the announcement to limit their business to just the USPS, and consequently lose their exclusivity with them. They also have, over the years, been focusing on their biggest and best clients, so tight relationships were built. In my opinion, STMP, will be able to retain a good portion of their existing clients as the competition simply can't compete effectively with them. EPS estimates of $5.15 - $6.15 per share are likely way too low. I'm anticipating a much better than expected Q1 and guidance to be bumped up. Any new partnerships/relations would be icing on the cake. STMP continues to do business as they always have and a 70% drop from their June '18 highs makes no sense other than Short manipulators and their antics."
"Solid beat ! for next q revenue guidance in line, eps above estimates."
"Who do you think knows more about STMP's business, competitors and what it needs to do for the best results in the future? An experienced management and BOD, or Shorts that continually bash the company? My guess is the former."
"Price falling premarket as investors realize any company can have a beat if you lower your estimates enough.The reality, its all down from a year ago!Total revenue was $160.9 million, down 5% compared to $170.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.GAAP net income was $20.3 million, down 52% compared to $42.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.GAAP net income per fully diluted share was $1.13, down 51% compared to $2.30 in the fourth quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $51.4 million, down 28% compared to $71.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.Non-GAAP adjusted income per fully diluted share was $2.12, down 43% compared to $3.73 in the fourth quarter of 2018."
"Quiz: Of the total revenue of 136M reported by stamps.com for 1Q 2019, how much of the revenue is attributable to USPS via commissions and reseller margins obtained and how much revenue that comes from customer subscriptions? If you own this stock or plan to own, you should know these metrics."
"Thinking of starting a position here. But reviewing the projection for 2019 as below, is there any reason to pay PE ratio of 24? Need advice please. Thanks. For fiscal year 2019, the Company currently expects its GAAP financial outlook to be as follows:We expect total revenue to be in a range of approximately $540 million to $570 million.We expect GAAP net income to be in a range of approximately $55 million to $69 million.We expect GAAP net income per fully diluted share to be in a range of approximately $2.86 to $3.76."
Maxim maintains a Buy rating but lowers STMP's price target from $415 to $405.
"So I am assuming that once the deal closes this week, the company will then go private and the stock will be pulled?"
"I saw a ShipStation commercial last night.....interesting. Lots of unlocked value in those subsidiaries, which begs the question? Why has it taken so long to tap into the potential of the sub companies? and Why didn't STMP renew the USPS for another year for both the Stamps.com website and Endicia website? CEO lost out on a revenue generating opportunity even if it is in a declining market. The USPS revenue alone could have paid for marketing Shipstation and the other sub companies. Just saying."
"STMP had a pretty strong earnings report, coming in 25% higher than expectations, but cut their guidance and the stock dropped more than 50%. Guidance of course is a guess from the company's management on future performance. What would it take in the next earnings release or two to get their price back up? Any thoughts?"
Management is to blame for the lack of news and the lack of change to their websites to highlight new partnerships. Thus not surprised that the price is moving lower.
"Three new analyst price targets for STMP. Yesterday B Riley FBR target-$300, and Roth Capital-$270, and today Maxim-$320. Very brave ahead of earnings....hope they are right"
"I just got a sales call from Shipstaion promoting Walmart integration. They are making sales calls to all their customer base trying to increase sales volume through their partnerships such as Walmart.com, Facebook market place and etc. Higher sales equals higher stock price."
"I have some long term hold shares. If the bought out went thru, I would get cash for my long term hold shares, does it count as long term gain or short term gain? Thank you for your answer in advance."
"April 27 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc reported a 27% rise in first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as it benefited from a surge in online purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic.The world's biggest parcel delivery company, which is also delivering COVID-19 vaccines company, said adjusted earnings per share jumped 141% to $2.77 in the quarter.Total revenue gained 27% at $22.9 billion."
"STMPS seems like a good inflation proof company...if anything inflation should help their business as people become more cognizant of offsetting higher costs. I would assume they have very little low income/min wage employees which is where many comapanies are seeing labor costs increases. And, STMPs products should save consumers & businesses money, while at the same time the ability to adjust price sensitivity if postage rates continue to increase. I recently started buying coffee at the store after SBUX raised their prices $0.40 to avoid the inflation (out of principle)...STMPS doesn't have to worry about losing customers in this environment"
"Will Stamps.com make a surprise announcement on June 12th, the date of its annual shareholder meeting?TJ"
"Well guys, it’s been a wild ride. I’m getting off here I guess. Bought at 40 and sold most at 80, kept some until now "
If the market keeps going down then earnings may not matter much. Longs would need the CEO to make a major announcement that could positively affect earnings going forward. It may take the CEO saying they are continuing with USPS for another year or two.
Stamps is doing a great job of being silent before releasing its earnings report or any news. I think this is going to spike (hopefully higher) after ER or PR. Happy Trading!
Hopefully STMP starts losing money and missing quarterly estimates. I’d like the stock start moving to $300
Can you imagine if Reddit Army put this stock on their buy list? This company actually prints money and obliterates expectations with a iron clad balance sheet.
Can anyone tell me what STMP does to make money and what value they bring to carriers and shippers?
Can anybody the exact earnings date? I see May 23 in Earnings Whispers.com and May 2 in TD ToS platform. May 23 would make sense given they reported on Feb 22. . .
"Eerie quiet heading into earnings. May 21 260 calls bidding at $2.30, for an implied break even value of $262.30. Investor relations needs to engage with coverage analysts to guide expectations. Markets don't like uncertainty, especially when market sentiment is tentative like we have now."
"Trying to gauge the strategy here and I see 2 possible paths1. Amazon buys STMP to accelerate entry into delivery. STMP has strong software and relationship moats that Amazon could take years to develop at significant cost. Stock price is depressed.2. STMP stays independent and signs up Amazon, UPS Fedex and others and acts as a one step aggregator solution. No one else can do this for competitor reasons. They will scrape revenue from all like a toll booth.They also have the most advanced international solutions which has huge value I’m leaning towards this but any way you slice it this company is extremely undervalued"
"I know it has been about 24 hrs since the $60 million stock buyback was announced but I keep having this nagging thought in my mind. Why would STMP's BOD commit to what the CEO Ken McBride announced to close to the total expected annual GAAP revenue for the entire 2019 year just toward buying back between 500,000-700,000 shares? It seems completely illogical on it's surface to tie up that amount of money. Don't get me wrong it's nice that the BOD authorized the amount and STMP management does not need to actually spend the funds for any buybacks, they just have the flexibility to do so. I keep thinking that the BOD was made aware of some other relevant development that prompted them to commit the $60 million. Is it pending new contracts, anticipation that revenue is tracking close to pre-earnings expectations or a proposed offer for the company as a whole. Obviously,there is more to this stock buyback decision that we have yet to hear. JMHO"
Current action in the stock is what I was afraid of when I dumped it just over 100 a few days ago. With NO NEWS from the company looks like this slow erosion will continue. Could be we get a retest of the recent lows near 82 bucks. Some people have recently made a Boat Load of money on this puppy. Those that are still holding from the recent lows will continue to lock in their gains (especially if it breaks 90 bucks). Love to re-buy this puppy but downside too great at this point (without positive news).
Citron says Shopify might buy STMP for 400$ a share. Tried to post SA article but yahoo is deleting it. Google it to see new write up.
"Comment in this weeks Barrons apparently STMP is a holding inBlackRock Mid-Cap Growth Equity - says -""Stamps.com (STMP) is riding the e-commerce wave, too, says Kemp. Acquisitions have vaulted Stamps from an online postage firm to cloud-based shipping services -- handling everything from managing orders to return authorizations. Major online retailers like eBay and Amazon.com now use Stamps' services. Although the stock has more than doubled over the past year, Kemp likes its prospects as online sales march higher. """
This stock is trading in a very narrow range - possible scalping opportunity.
"During the conference call, CEO said that $PBI added (3 ) 100,000 feet storage facilities. So E commerce is becoming one of the major components of its business. Thereby is the expention. Moreover, everyone who prints shipping labels is partially Pitney Bowes's business. Junk nail sorting unfortunately declined by 8%. That junk email generated good chunk of sorting and mailing profits. However, thereafter, quarantine, it may return to growth. If not, new tech will replace it into digital format. My hunch is, that Pitney Bowes, is becoming major player in E commerce business. Not only it is becoming a major player, it is expending and growing. According to conference call, It invests in new technology. I conjecure, it will move into $STMP price range of $250 in few years time. Stock was in hybernation mode for a while. Nonetheless, it is 100 years old company. Accumulate and be patient."
The volume today was absolutely enormous. 5x average with the pps up almost 19%. If this isn’t bullish I don’t what is.
"No real volume until the streets gets some color on the UPS deal, and sees the earnings and forward guidance.Simply put, while the cat's away, the mice will play. Short playground until earnings release, plain and simple.Will be interesting to see what happens the day before earnings going into the close."
CEO said earnings would be as low #$%$15 profit per share on revenue of $540 million-$570 million. Yep a profit not a loss. Sorry but STMP just makes money. Management doesn't dilute shares nor run up debt. They are focused on making money. That $5.15 profit and $540 million does not include any new contracts. In fact analyst estimate 2019 reveune as $689 million before the news dropped which is only $150 million difference. Will 1 or 2 contracts help to make up that $150 million difference? Who knows but we will all find out soon. I think McBride is being a leader.
"Takes money to make money scared money don't make money I knew I was right I knew everyone out there was right when I made that chances of making millions of dollars from cryptocurrencies and it was of no regrets when I started investing, I will rather say is the best so far in binary option and everyone should adopt that chance of making money online.Today I recommend to you this lady that have brought me out from zero to a stable life and she's been recommended as Charlotte James her successful story have been written all over the world how she help people with their trade and gives remarkable testimonies about her investment platform her experience as a trader is so perfect and unique for investment I can't be afraid anymore trading in crypto cause I earn maximum profit trading in Mrs Charlotte James platform."
So Far earnings call is going well. 15 new partnerships that have to be announced some are Significant. 24 million dollars left on the buy back extended through May 2020. Increased top and bottom line guidance results. All good points. CANNOT give any details of the UPS deal but that did not seem to be a big deal they are very happy with the deal the CEO said. I'm sure tomorrow these wonderful analyst will increase PT and guidance. Let's keep this going. Would of love to see this over 100 tonight was as high as 988. Good luck to us longs.
"STMP May trade horizontal until next earnings.. There’s a lot of firepower out there to knock down up moves and seemingly there is not enough confidence to shake them, although I’m hoping for a Christmas bump in the next couple weeks.In any case, when they report big earnings late Feb for the December quarter, you can expect a big pop up in price, when the shorts scramble to cover. There’s about 6 days worth of short interest right now, which is a recipe for a big price jump on positive news.. Price over $200 is fair as it will be PE around 20, and STMP is not an overpriced stock right now, although many other internet companies are overpriced."
"Nice to see the blog, Simply Wall St., comment on the intrinsic value of STMP being $168/share. 100% upside from these ridiculous levels brought upon us from scared longs and manipulative shorts selling without logical reason. Great balance sheet and opportunities opening up. I sincerely doubt STMP will lose any meaningful percentage of existing customers and clients. Their retention level will be high and opportunities for further growth better than ever."
No morning drop today as selling has dried up. Break of $190 would be very positive.
It appears that Shopify has implemented its own ePostage system for USPS shipping labels. They were using Stamps/Endicia before. Not sure exactly when the switch took place.TJ
"Does anyone have any thoughts on why the volume always dramatically spikes the last 10 minutes of trading. In the last 7minutes today volume jumped 84,000 shares...and that is typical of most days. Unusual for a thinly traded stock. Thanks for any info."
"Insider selling is not such a bad thing. It brings in tons of money for the company. For example, Stamps increased their cash balance by $287,245,000 during 2020. 45% of that, or $130,680,000, was due to ""Proceeds from exercise of stock options"". In other words, the company made as much from its primary business operations as it did from insider sales. Cool!TJ"
"its clear this stock has been manipulated down by one naked short seller. the stock has a pattern of these 100 point drops. the only sellers are management and the naked short seller. management effectively cooperates with the short seller by making no objections or fails to work to find buyers or wall street buyer upgrades. they benefit by buying their stock back after these 100 point drops. i believe this violates their fiduciary duty to common shareholders and may qualify as gross negligence. i believe shareholders should contact the board of directors and seek intervention. they all get discounted stock options. i would like to see those agreements. anyone interested in legal action against the company , its officers and board of directors and reporting the naked short seller to the ag of california and the sec? it smells"
"Just added more shares, good luck longs."
This thing is sniffing for a better offer.
"I've been long since $90 when they took the first 50% haircut and when we took another 50% haircut last earning i loaded up and averaged down to $51. What I dont get is the way and time its taking for them to secure new partners. You don't quit your job and then go out and test the market for new opportunities. You line up your job offers first and then tell your boss adios. Either way, this is at least moving in a positive direction and a much better outcome than the last 2 earnings, but they really have to step it up in the coming months."
So are we not going to get other offers at this point?
I hope people are not bailing because earnings will be bad after the close today? It has dropped 13 points in the past 2 weeks. Please no thumbs down I'm a long and would love to see a huge pop. Volume up rom normal level at this point of the day. Good luck to us longs.
Something is definitely going on with this stock....it was $56 August 14th/ $42. Any thoughts. about this big breakout?
This is once in a lifetime opportunity. I will buy more shares in the morning.
blowout earnings with amazon limiting 3rd party FBA sellers inventory.
News Flash: The meeting took less than 10 minutes. Stamps shareholders approved the Thoma Bravo buyout.Congratulations to all!!!TJ
for god sakes.....why can't the CEO just make a nice little statement
"well, we finally broke the 196 bench mark that we couldn't seem to pass through in the past few weeks... its time to rise. All my couriers have told me its been busy as December/January, it has not stopped since. People are shipping folks, this is the future. Earnings 1st week of May. Let's go!"
"Anyone long have any reasons they are holding on? The only person I see posting actual data is Researcher who just gave up his long positions. I got beat up real bad and am still holding out some hope, but hope isn't going to fix this situation."
Either way stmp wins with a binning economy shipping increases. With a stay a home online shopping increases shipping increases. Jmho
I’m not selling mine and I’m buying more! This stock will skyrocket sometimes soon!
"Reminds me of when i lost 20% overnight with FB on earnings last July. Was a tough day. Tough week. A tough month, actually was a tough year. And im still hurting."
This price decline is puzzling. Manipulation still going on. Does anybody here know when the buy backs are slated? This week?
Why did management get bonuses when they knew they would drop this bomb? How many sold stock just prior to dropping the bomb?
https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/stamps-com-announces-share-repurchase-plan-14892859
"There is absolutely no reason why the stock is trading at this price, the price should at least $50.00 more per share, between 140 - 150, or for that matter over the levels it was trading out a comment over $200.00 a share. They have continued their business, as usual, all USPS stamps print correctly not even a glitch, this overall fiasco is way out of nothing. Stamps.com continues providing shipping of USPS + it will be adding more carriers, which means more revenue. The market way overreacted out of nothing."
"I was cutting and pasting from my word pad and the post did not appear. So typing it in: This stock is so polarized. Not seen anything like this recently. Investors of the stock believe that the stock is undervalued, holds promise and look forward to positive news interms of new partnerships with significant players and other means showing path to earnings growth and future value addition from the earnings call. Shorts tend to disagree as their view is that the business model of STMP is fundamentally broken with USPS direct commission related revenue gone and more bad news is awaited. Two different perspectives from the two sides. Bets have been made on both sides. IMO, It will be a good practice to remain hedged when we have such differences going on to the earnings call regardless of the type of trade (long/short) taken. Hedges (via options) although cost some money they can offer protection."
Looking at the web traffic graphs for all the stamps branded websites on alexa over last 90 days.... this move is not a shocker with earnings 2 weeks away. Web traffic extremely strong and steady... much higher than 3 months ago.
I sold with a limit order at 45. That usually means it will take off soon.Good luck.
"Increased buyback from $60mm to $120mm is too little too late. Shareholders have lost confidence. Share buyback needs to be north of $225 to be credible, preferably with a significant purchase of shares, at the market, by the Board and Executive Management."
"ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN-Price has been beaten down so much that any good news is going to make stock pop. Think CEO may need to go but shipping business is growing at a great rate. Amazon, UPS, FDX and USPS can all beat themselves up but stamp.com platform is good and valuable to every player in this competitive space. What we need to execute is contracts with every one of those large shippers. That should have been done BEFORE the USPS contract was terminated in my humble opinion. Can't cry over spilled milk. Still believe that STMP can execute good contracts with multiple shippers and make a comeback. May take some time but upside could be massive"
"Seems otherwise smart investors have lost their collective minds here. STMP will buy a ton of shares back, announce big news, and crush short sellers down here. Impossible to keep this down here long term."
Couple of advisors asking to sell if it near 328/329 value...
Northland Securities have a $145 price target on the stock. The price target gives a potential upside of 68.25% from Stampscom (NASDAQ:STMP)‘s last stock close. This rating was released in analysts report on 22 February. (Wouldn’t mind that!!!)
"CEO McBride said that the company was in ""advanced negotiations"". My only question is whether they need to wait until the month ends before releasing that news or if they are still in talks with a new partner. Either way, something could be announced at any time which will affect future business, revenue and earnings positively."
https://www.smarteranalyst.com/brief/stampscom-stmp-gets-a-buy-rating-from-b-riley-fbr/
"No sell side interest because company is cash cow. Only way to get value is activist or takeover. Management is content to maintain status quo, now doing so with no guidance with a cash moat surrounding the C suite."
"One week ago on Feb 21 2019, STMP announced earnings then informed everyone that they ended their contract with USPS over attempting to be non-exclusive, which the USPS decline to agree to. McBride lowered estimated revenue and earnings for 2019 and also mentioned that management was in advanced negotiations(?). If the USPS contract was over at that time then STMP would have no incentive to offer discounts because they would not gain any revenue from USPS. After a number of days, on Feb 25th on Stamps.com twitter and facebook there is a post mentioning a discount on first class mail. On Feb 27th, YESTERDAY, another post appears on twitter and facebook specifically saying that Stamps.com customers can continue to buy and print all USPS Services. Additionally, Stamps.com will continue to offer USPS rate discounts. The question is: Was a new deal agreed to between USPS and STMP? It is my belief that is the case. If I am correct then the projected revenue shortfall would be millions less than predicted. The Twitter and Facebook posts are not ""old news"". In fact those posts couldn't be more relevant considering the situation as that has been the only communication from STMP since last Thursday."
"Can someone help clarify? stamps.com has six brands and already supports already supports multi carrier platforms via the following 4 brands per their investor presentation slides in their website which mentions (slide 4 of 40 in the link below) namely:ShipStation and ShipEngine offer web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at eCommerce and high volume shipping customers, ShipWorks offers client-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at eCommerce and high volume shippers, ShippingEasy offers web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at online retailers and eCommerce customers.: https://investor.stamps.com/static-files/874771cf-2b8a-465a-a201-8187e61fbd20Of the remaining brands, stamps.com and endicia support USPS related mailing and shipping. Trying to understand why lose USPS exclusivity with these brands and give up sizable chunk of revenue if they can enhance multi-carrier support through the other 4 brands? I am sure I could be missing something really here. If any of you understand the rationale can you help clarify? thanks in advance"
Slow and steady move up has begun. 85.60 first target and then breaks 87.11 to get to 100+
Bright future bought more today. Very undervalued in my opinion. Looking at the market cap its like just slightly less than 1.5 billion.
"Anybody think our chances just went up dramatically that we get some guidance in the call next week? What more does McBride need to allay his doubts about consumer behavior than the recent FedEx numbers, today's UPS numbers and the recent AMZN stock price action?"
"No guidance, they can buy back shares cheap and shorts can wonder when they might suddenly restore forward guidance in weeks or months..... similar to 4Q2020 where they sounded negative to neutral at best and just laid down numbers that blew it away."
"motley fold advises to sell STMP , not sure .. any advice"
"Just like I said, here it is.....https://www.ecommercebytes.com/2019/09/06/stamps-com-preps-for-possible-international-mail-disruptions/"
"Gotta love the $60,000,000 buyback starting today along with the 20% short position that eventually have to cover!Shorting STMP when it was priced to perfection made sense, but not now around $90/share. STMP will retain a large amount of their USPS customers and open up new revenue streams and new business relationships and eventually be making $12++/share EPS. Sky's the limit with their hands untied."
"Bought Stmp a few days after the big drop in February . I bought more yesterday. Of all the recent trades , this one gives me happy thoughts of things to come."
Stock will be approaching 55 near term. We may get a huge spike into 80's after that.
"Bull case: Reading the bull case articles, STMP corporate investor presentations and chat boards, STMP has been providing significant mail volume to USPS and has very good software and tools, a popular website and brands (endicia et al). STMP walked away from the USPS direct commission arrangement to facilitate itself to make alliances with other carriers as seen from the recent earnings call transcript. As for the bulls, STMP must have done this only if it was sure of replacing the revenue. Hence bulls look forward to an imminent announcement from STMP in the very near future related to new business relationship with other carriers/major entities in the very near future. A Barrons article that talked about why Amazon should acquire this. https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-what-about-buying-stamps-com-1518455988Bear case: As for the bears on the board, The questions that are lingering are why give up the direct revenue from USPS without another replacement in place besides stamps.com? Already STMP has multicarrier support through some of its other brands and was exclusivity really an issue?. The USPS relationship was very significant for STMP’s revenues and losing the direct commission part of it supports a bear thesis unless there is evidence of a replacement revenue. Buyout or tie up by a new major player such as Amazon is purely speculative as yet. A past article on the bear side from Google search from Capitolforum.com that talks about various pushes and pulls, regulatory pressures since it involves USPS a government entity in this business and other exposures to stamps.com. https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Stamps.com-2016.12.12.pdfone more very recent seeking alpha article on the bear side:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4243499-stamps-com-amazingly-biggest-shoe-yet-dropDisclaimer: I am not vouching for the accuracy of the reports cited here. Also I am not recommending anyone to buy or sell the stock or its options. Please do your own due diligence and investigations before trading or taking new position to be long or short of the STMP stock. I am a recent entrant to this stock trade and I may take long, short positions depending on what I think may be best on a given day. Just want to develop some mature discussions so everyone can share information one and all legacy and newbees included over this stock to become more informed on trading decisions. Good luck to everyone."

"Basically do what the insiders are doing, selling everything in sight before earnings and after earnings... whenever and you can buy it back cheaper later or get more options to replace the ones you sold... free money growing on trees.... sell sell sell, that's all, until there is some incentive to do otherwise."
"So, what's the opposite of ""timberrrrr!""?"
I would imagine Thoma Bravo had access to Q2 results during due diligence? Thoughts? Would be nice to know there are no surprises that could suddenly blow up the deal
"Technically speaking, stock is performing brilliantly this morning. We've already had a higher high then Friday, which is extremely positive!! If we can finish near the highs for the day that will be another positive."
IV very high. Article CNBC stating Mcbride touting AMZN shipping becoming huge. My guess AMZN buys STMP same way they bought ring. 1.8 billion market cap can easily go for double and still be a cheap acquisition. I bought 35 of the Jan 2020 100 calls and soon Im gonna play the homerun and buy .05 calls way out of the money and pocket millions. I did just that with RCPT. Had 2000 contracts .05. ENDP upped bid when I was at lunch from 63 to 73 and my 10K investment was a little over 2 million in seconds. Sold and never looked back. Already made 15K with this one. Bought calls next morning after dive. Lets be realistic nobody is going to change from them. I hate waiting on postal lines so if I have to pay full price or even a little higher its worth it

"I doubled my shares today since it appears nobody read the recent excellent quarterly report and increased guidance. And Covid is still surging folks...demand for this company’s online products will continue to be huge for a long time yet. To those who foolishly sold, THANK YOU for your shares."
"I agree partially about the logic of the Steinmart acquisition. Amzn bought Steinmart mainly for the real estate. In my opinion being in the postal field my whole life, Shopify with their 32B market cap could easily acquire and integrate seamlessly into their platform. Thoughts?"
Today I noticed that volume has picked up at this time having 207K shares trade is above the norm at this point. Perhaps they are starting to buy back stock and create a floor. Only time will tell. But yes I believe the stock has fallen enough and that any positive news will finally put a break on the slide. Good luck to us longs.
"Stamps will be presenting at the Roth Investor Conference on Tuesday, March 19th @ 1:30PM. The mere fact that they intend to show up even though they know they are going to be asked a lot of questions is good news in itself, otherwise they would have postponed."
Anyone have a list of stamps partners? I know last earnings they said something about getting back with USPS. Do we know how much they do with USPS? Are they still exclusive or do they have a smaller percentage?
Why would STMP post news about rate discounts less than 24 hrs ago? I think that a new contract with USPS was agreed to in which has just not been announced publicly. Over time I have found that by doing dd sometimes you can find something before the street does. What that news means to me is that current customers may see that nothing has changed and will stay and do business as normal with STMP. The company may not see a large revenue drop and possibly no revenue drop. Looking forward to hearing from the company though

"This buy back isn't helping much to prop the stock up, every day new low. Going through 80 today by the looks of it."
FedEx blew their earnings. Package deliveries way up. This again bodes well for Stmp’s earnings again
"Shorts will lose their shirts ,soon this will be triple digits and that will be only the beginning"
Can we trade it after halt? Will the halt end as it goes private?
"Profitable, returning shareholder capital, no net debt. Exactly what you dont want as an investor...sheesh"
Another new 52 week low today think it is time for a MGMT change. That would be a first good announcement this year. Very sad at this point.
