"There is absolutely no reason why the stock is trading at this price, the price should at least $50.00 more per share, between 140 - 150, or for that matter over the levels it was trading out a comment over $200.00 a share. They have continued their business, as usual, all USPS stamps print correctly not even a glitch, this overall fiasco is way out of nothing. Stamps.com continues providing shipping of USPS + it will be adding more carriers, which means more revenue. The market way overreacted out of nothing."
It's important for the CEO and management to put out news on strategic partnerships soon.
News Flash: The meeting took less than 10 minutes. Stamps shareholders approved the Thoma Bravo buyout.Congratulations to all!!!TJ
"Recent 3/3 analyst George Sutton target of $340. And Maxim $405. Sutton noted that NRF and USPS data indicates FY21 online retail growth of 18-23%. I think stock is down with post-Covid selloff and lack of guidance, but online sales are here to stay and growing, making great profit margins, plenty of cash, low PE and float. Technically, extreme oversold. Strong buy at these levels."
"Visit Stamps.com Twitter and facebook pages.The rake rate may have changed but it appears that the USPS relationship is still there. Since STMP was looking at a loss of $150 million in revenue, I would have to say that the continuation should result less revenue loss. Higher revenues and possible new partnerships could be a huge boon for STMP. Here is what it shows on Twitter.Stamps.com @StampsCom Feb 27Morehttp://Stamps.com customers can continue to buy and print all USPS Services. Additionally, http://Stamps.com will continue to offer USPS rate discounts:"
"I’ve owned this stock over 20 years! Finally paying off live I knew it could. Have more shares now than have ever held since bought and sold over the years. Yes, happy day. If I wasn’t already retired, I would be now! Congratulations to all stockholders of STMP!!"
"Can someone help clarify? stamps.com has six brands and already supports already supports multi carrier platforms via the following 4 brands per their investor presentation slides in their website which mentions (slide 4 of 40 in the link below) namely:ShipStation and ShipEngine offer web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at eCommerce and high volume shipping customers, ShipWorks offers client-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at eCommerce and high volume shippers, ShippingEasy offers web-based multi-carrier shipping solutions targeted at online retailers and eCommerce customers.: https://investor.stamps.com/static-files/874771cf-2b8a-465a-a201-8187e61fbd20Of the remaining brands, stamps.com and endicia support USPS related mailing and shipping. Trying to understand why lose USPS exclusivity with these brands and give up sizable chunk of revenue if they can enhance multi-carrier support through the other 4 brands? I am sure I could be missing something really here. If any of you understand the rationale can you help clarify? thanks in advance"
"So I am assuming that once the deal closes this week, the company will then go private and the stock will be pulled?"
"Bull case: Reading the bull case articles, STMP corporate investor presentations and chat boards, STMP has been providing significant mail volume to USPS and has very good software and tools, a popular website and brands (endicia et al). STMP walked away from the USPS direct commission arrangement to facilitate itself to make alliances with other carriers as seen from the recent earnings call transcript. As for the bulls, STMP must have done this only if it was sure of replacing the revenue. Hence bulls look forward to an imminent announcement from STMP in the very near future related to new business relationship with other carriers/major entities in the very near future. A Barrons article that talked about why Amazon should acquire this. https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-what-about-buying-stamps-com-1518455988Bear case: As for the bears on the board, The questions that are lingering are why give up the direct revenue from USPS without another replacement in place besides stamps.com? Already STMP has multicarrier support through some of its other brands and was exclusivity really an issue?. The USPS relationship was very significant for STMP’s revenues and losing the direct commission part of it supports a bear thesis unless there is evidence of a replacement revenue. Buyout or tie up by a new major player such as Amazon is purely speculative as yet. A past article on the bear side from Google search from Capitolforum.com that talks about various pushes and pulls, regulatory pressures since it involves USPS a government entity in this business and other exposures to stamps.com. https://thecapitolforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Stamps.com-2016.12.12.pdfone more very recent seeking alpha article on the bear side:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4243499-stamps-com-amazingly-biggest-shoe-yet-dropDisclaimer: I am not vouching for the accuracy of the reports cited here. Also I am not recommending anyone to buy or sell the stock or its options. Please do your own due diligence and investigations before trading or taking new position to be long or short of the STMP stock. I am a recent entrant to this stock trade and I may take long, short positions depending on what I think may be best on a given day. Just want to develop some mature discussions so everyone can share information one and all legacy and newbees included over this stock to become more informed on trading decisions. Good luck to everyone."
"NO WAY the CEO turns down being exclusive to USPS unless another deal opportunity was presenting itself...""The breakup came after Stamps.com said it no longer wants to be exclusive with the Postal Service, terms that the postal service refused to accept, McBride told analysts. Stamps.com said it was looking to work with other carriers such as United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp.""We will no longer be exclusive to the USPS and that's non-negotiable,"" McBride said on the earnings call.""Our customers can no longer survive on just the USPS, and we don't see that as a viable option for the next five years,"" McBride said. ""So basically that was our premise, is like, no matter what, this company can no longer be exclusive given the trends in the shipping market."""
"A long history of low-balling EPS guidance. Last year the beat every quarter, and by a lot. 25% overall and 39% in the final quarter. Now we have guidance set at around $5.50/share. Probably a worse case scenario. Very little debt and plenty of cash, plus so many opportunities to expand their business now with their hands untied. If Stmp can forge the business relations they anticipate and get EPS up over $12/share (fewer outstanding shares with buybacks), we'll be wellover $200/share again."
"I know it has been about 24 hrs since the $60 million stock buyback was announced but I keep having this nagging thought in my mind. Why would STMP's BOD commit to what the CEO Ken McBride announced to close to the total expected annual GAAP revenue for the entire 2019 year just toward buying back between 500,000-700,000 shares? It seems completely illogical on it's surface to tie up that amount of money. Don't get me wrong it's nice that the BOD authorized the amount and STMP management does not need to actually spend the funds for any buybacks, they just have the flexibility to do so. I keep thinking that the BOD was made aware of some other relevant development that prompted them to commit the $60 million. Is it pending new contracts, anticipation that revenue is tracking close to pre-earnings expectations or a proposed offer for the company as a whole. Obviously,there is more to this stock buyback decision that we have yet to hear. JMHO"
"April 27 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc reported a 27% rise in first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as it benefited from a surge in online purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic.The world's biggest parcel delivery company, which is also delivering COVID-19 vaccines company, said adjusted earnings per share jumped 141% to $2.77 in the quarter.Total revenue gained 27% at $22.9 billion."
"STMP went from $70/share in July, 2016 to $270/share in July, 2018 (it Can happen again). Only having a USPS relationship had their earnings clearly plateauing and management knew this. Thus, they had to open up other opportunities and take a short term hit to earnings."
Do we know any dates for buy-out/pay-out?
Another new 52 week low today think it is time for a MGMT change. That would be a first good announcement this year. Very sad at this point.
This is once in a lifetime opportunity. I will buy more shares in the morning.
look what happened to Steinmart today. Stock pops over 50% immediately after announcing kiosk partnership with Amazon. If STMP smart will do deal with Amazon shipping which is looking to grow. Believe amazon wants to ship far more than their own products. They want to pose serious challenge to FDX and UPS. Steinmart on verge of going under and Amazon partners with them. Don't see why they would not want to become preferred shipper for Stamps.com platforms
"Well guys, it’s been a wild ride. I’m getting off here I guess. Bought at 40 and sold most at 80, kept some until now "
FedEx blew their earnings. Package deliveries way up. This again bodes well for Stmp’s earnings again
Couple of advisors asking to sell if it near 328/329 value...
So are we not going to get other offers at this point?
"The more i investigate about yesterday's earning report, the more i am amused to see this unexplained selloff...1. EPS double than the estimate2. The company reduced debt to zero (huge plus) and increased cash to $443,552,0003. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 96 thousand shares at a total cost of approximately $20.8 million. From August 11, 2020 through February 5, 2021, we have repurchased approximately $40.0 million under a $40 million total repurchase plan. On February 11, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan which will commence on February 22, 2021 and which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $60 million of stock over the six months following its effective date.There is not a single decent reason for such a huge selloff. Based on the strong fundamentals i have increased, in fact doubled, my position with this selloff..."
"Stamps will be presenting at the Roth Investor Conference on Tuesday, March 19th @ 1:30PM. The mere fact that they intend to show up even though they know they are going to be asked a lot of questions is good news in itself, otherwise they would have postponed."
"In March, when $STMP was trading at $175, a bozo stock analyst named Bruce Kamich wrote that ""I agree with (Jim) Cramer's advice that STMP should be sold. All the charts and indicators spell trouble ahead.""https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/stamps-com-return-to-sender-15606210That advice didn't work out too well, did it?TJ"
"Gotta love the $60,000,000 buyback starting today along with the 20% short position that eventually have to cover!Shorting STMP when it was priced to perfection made sense, but not now around $90/share. STMP will retain a large amount of their USPS customers and open up new revenue streams and new business relationships and eventually be making $12++/share EPS. Sky's the limit with their hands untied."
"I was cutting and pasting from my word pad and the post did not appear. So typing it in: This stock is so polarized. Not seen anything like this recently. Investors of the stock believe that the stock is undervalued, holds promise and look forward to positive news interms of new partnerships with significant players and other means showing path to earnings growth and future value addition from the earnings call. Shorts tend to disagree as their view is that the business model of STMP is fundamentally broken with USPS direct commission related revenue gone and more bad news is awaited. Two different perspectives from the two sides. Bets have been made on both sides. IMO, It will be a good practice to remain hedged when we have such differences going on to the earnings call regardless of the type of trade (long/short) taken. Hedges (via options) although cost some money they can offer protection."
This stock is trading in a very narrow range - possible scalping opportunity.
"Sooo no guidance, but share $40m repurchase completed & new $60m program added ---hmm I think they are telling us its undervalued by buying back; but waitdiluted share count went up 2m shares yoy, 17m to 19m....how are share counts increasing when shares are being repurchased.....share based compensationIf you are going to treat investors this way, you could at least provide an outlook for the next 12 months. I think that is warranted with running a business with public investors"
"It's difficult to say this but I was wrong on STMP. I thought the CEO was sincere when he said in the conference call that the company was in ""Advanced negotiations"". I and others thought that meant a new partnership or few may be pending and were looking forward to a news release at any moment. 31 days later after earnings/cc, no word from the CEO or anyone in management. I am beginning to think that was just a Trump type phrase such as after the mid terms the middle class tax cut will be passed. Obviously, neither the CEO nor management care about investors and keeping us informed."
“We crushed earnings and estimates” Huge drop.
52 week high: $285.75 Simple fact is the CEO is responsible for the current price of $80.35. I can't blame him for the decision to end exclusivity with USPS but to not announce something to replace the lost revenue with should directly result in his firing. No excuses. Smart people find and accept a new job before giving notice to their current employer. 285.75 => 80.33
"Trying to gauge the strategy here and I see 2 possible paths1. Amazon buys STMP to accelerate entry into delivery. STMP has strong software and relationship moats that Amazon could take years to develop at significant cost. Stock price is depressed.2. STMP stays independent and signs up Amazon, UPS Fedex and others and acts as a one step aggregator solution. No one else can do this for competitor reasons. They will scrape revenue from all like a toll booth.They also have the most advanced international solutions which has huge value I’m leaning towards this but any way you slice it this company is extremely undervalued"
Looking at the web traffic graphs for all the stamps branded websites on alexa over last 90 days.... this move is not a shocker with earnings 2 weeks away. Web traffic extremely strong and steady... much higher than 3 months ago.
"STMPS seems like a good inflation proof company...if anything inflation should help their business as people become more cognizant of offsetting higher costs. I would assume they have very little low income/min wage employees which is where many comapanies are seeing labor costs increases. And, STMPs products should save consumers & businesses money, while at the same time the ability to adjust price sensitivity if postage rates continue to increase. I recently started buying coffee at the store after SBUX raised their prices $0.40 to avoid the inflation (out of principle)...STMPS doesn't have to worry about losing customers in this environment"
"motley fold advises to sell STMP , not sure .. any advice"
"Several questions linger in the minds of investors. If the company provides more clarity will instill better confidence. I hope in the upcoming earnings call, the analysts will make effort to ask questions related to1. Breakdown of revenue streams (instead of lumping) providing more visibility into revenue and growth opportunities in each of the stream2. How much revenue is still expected from USPS via indirect means (from integration partners as the direct part is no longer present since the company walked away from it) and the visibility of this revenue continuing into the foreseeable future especially the company had earlier identified such revenue exposed to the risk of future USPS re-negotiations (in Risk factors section of the recent 10K published)3. Probably related to Q2: Any of the integration partners such as IntuiSHIP going though or impacted by similar re-negotiations with USPS?3. Status of the class action lawsuits against the company and any exposures thereof4. Status of progress related to company's efforts to find new revenue stream to remedy the lost revenue from direct commission part from USPS(via partnerships or new products or new acquisitions)5. Share buybacks: How many shares were bought after the company announced share buy back in march6. Potential credit card fee increases: Will there be any sizable exposure to revenue expected coming from credit card processing fee increase to merchants by Mastercard and Visa (or can such cost be passed to customers without impact)7. How are the existing customers taking the subscription fee increases - any impacts to customer retention from fees?"
"Market will have to interpolate the meaning of the net/net conservative guidance for Q4.Q2 and Q3 were such huge blowout quarters mgmt and markets are spooked about Q4 andwondering how much holiday activity might have been pulled forward and thus exxageratingQ2 and Q3. On top of that you have a huge market runup to digest and a trend when stocksare selling off on great earnings, and no serious talk on stimulus."
"For those wondering whether to sell or hold at the current level: So the 330 buyout represents approximately 2% premium to it's current trading price of 323. There is a 40 day allowance for higher offer. 40 days is roughly one ninth of a year. 2% compounded 9 times equals a roughly 20% rate of return. Now we need to discount the 20% for the risk of the offer falling through, but we also need to make allowance for the potential of a higher offer. In my opinion, they're roughly the same leaving me with a 20% annualized rate of return to hold.You may use different approximations for discounting the respective downside/upside risks, but 20% rate of return should be the baseline.Note: Depending on their price, it may be possible to combine put options with owned shares to create a breakeven position in the event of either standard buyout or deal falling through, leaving only the upside of a white knight deal."
"I wonder how much more stock is out there with 35.04 conversion price like those shares sold by insider Buerba today. That is dilutive and doesn't raise cash for the company. Insiders back selling again already. At some point maybe a Carl Icahn type will step in and deliver some shareholder value for the common stockholders, not just an insider handout program that fills the coffers with cash and builds a wall around the C suite. No guidance ??? No insider buying, only stock option handouts that get liquidated before the ink dries."
