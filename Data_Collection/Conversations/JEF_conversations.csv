"JEF is one of the worst stocks I have ever owned. This was a $20-stock in 10/2004. In the past five years, the DOW is up 52% while JEF is down 26%. The CEO, Richard Handler, made $42 million last year. Did any of you attend the last meeting of shareholders? We were told that Wall St. just does not understand JEF and that the stock price should be ""much higher."" One attendee stated, ""JEF is exactly what the stock price says it is."" JEF is losing a LOT of money due to a horrible bet it placed on Spectrum Brands (SPB). I urge everyone to attend the meeting in 2020. Misery loves company."

THESE ANALYSTS AT JEF MUST BE MAKING A TON OF MONEY SELLING THEIR RECOMENDATION TO HEDGE FUNDS.IS A BOILER ROOM OPERATION WHAT THEY GOT
Jefferies Financial Group was recently dropped from the S&P 500 Index and placed in the S&P Midcap 400 Index. So...the S&P 500 Index funds have been selling it....

"Considering that at 33.5$, JEF has Mcap: 8.5B$, Enterprise V:30B$. Sumitomo M. buying 5% of the company for 386m$, it values JEF at 7.7B$ (386m/5%). That is a lot lower than BOOK V. (30B$) and less than Mcap. I do not know how to interpret this?.. Does JEF at 33$ is a fair Business Value?... WHAT YOU THINK? I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT."
Jefferies Financial is up 4.92% to 33.49
Looks like brake out. No?
Massive volume at the end of the day. We were having a nice day until 3:30. anyone hear of anything?
Another area JEF might want to invest in is the legal pot business.
Handler needs to go. The guy is an incompetent fool
I would like to see JEF to make an investment in the gene editing space as I believe it will transform healthcare. My personal preference is EDIT.
Why the pop?

"Is the Tangible Book Value per share equal to $13.62? Tangible gross leverage ratio of 9.7 seems a little high. And what is the Book Value of Golden Queen, their associated gold mining company that was valued at debt plus $4.5MM for a 50% interest in the total mine. JEF has less than a 40% interest in the mine. Be careful."

This is great company and if interest Rate go-up will benefit. If they raise dividend shares go to 40$ range. Keep E.mailing to Company demanding that you want more dividend. They can effort it as it stupidly buying shares rather than raising dividend! Keep Pressure on.
Good Investor Day Presentation today.

"The spectrum brands spinoff is not well received. Small stockholders (say a 1,000 shares) hate these kind of moves. They end up with....25 shares. And their brokerage may charge to handle the distribution. Then to get out of the position, they have to pay the commission."

I have been seeing Jefferies listed quite often as the company being used for Bio companies during share issues. Right now there is a lot of Bio corps taking advantage of rising share prices by issuing new stock. Can't be bad for Jef...
"10-Q I note with disappointment the significant write downs in their investment portfolios in Vitesse Energy, JETX Energy, The We Company, the Renaissance Plaza in Brooklyn and RedSky Fulton Mall (???); but no mention of Golden Queen. Is Golden Queen still operating? Are they still losing money? Did they report on Golden Queen somewhere else that I missed? HELP! JEF's investment record has been pretty bad. Let's hope it gets better or they stick to what they know."
this company has a most unusual diverse holdings....no rhyme n no reason....

Up or down big tomorrow ….I say up….
Jef have any dealings with china?
Baby Berkshire gets minimal coverage??? Very confusing but great opportunity to continue to build a position into what could become something huge over the years.
What’s the logic behind this company taking a 30-40% shave in SP due to the virus?? They have more opportunities not less to do what they do and make more money doing it! Doesn’t make sense to me...
I have owned LUK twice over the last 20+ years. Both times after reading raves about how it’s a miniBerkshire and sure to break out. Lost $$$ both times. How are things different THIS time? Fool me twice . . .
