I have owned LUK twice over the last 20+ years. Both times after reading raves about how it’s a miniBerkshire and sure to break out. Lost $$$ both times. How are things different THIS time? Fool me twice . . .
"Bullish indication in MACD, KDJ and RSI, according to stoxline. A break of 24.87 could move it up to 29.05."
Barrons released an article an hour ago about JEF. Since I don't subscribe I could not read the article but it sounds bullish.

This is great company and if interest Rate go-up will benefit. If they raise dividend shares go to 40$ range. Keep E.mailing to Company demanding that you want more dividend. They can effort it as it stupidly buying shares rather than raising dividend! Keep Pressure on.

I have been seeing Jefferies listed quite often as the company being used for Bio companies during share issues. Right now there is a lot of Bio corps taking advantage of rising share prices by issuing new stock. Can't be bad for Jef...

Guys! Why is this down so much?
"JEF is one of the worst stocks I have ever owned. This was a $20-stock in 10/2004. In the past five years, the DOW is up 52% while JEF is down 26%. The CEO, Richard Handler, made $42 million last year. Did any of you attend the last meeting of shareholders? We were told that Wall St. just does not understand JEF and that the stock price should be ""much higher."" One attendee stated, ""JEF is exactly what the stock price says it is."" JEF is losing a LOT of money due to a horrible bet it placed on Spectrum Brands (SPB). I urge everyone to attend the meeting in 2020. Misery loves company."
Stock down big again. What is going on here?????

JEF reached a 52 Week low at $16.50
"The spectrum brands spinoff is not well received. Small stockholders (say a 1,000 shares) hate these kind of moves. They end up with....25 shares. And their brokerage may charge to handle the distribution. Then to get out of the position, they have to pay the commission."
"Do you know JEF owns 100% of ""Idaho Timber"" ($421 M revenue, $79M pre-tax profit, last year). Now timber/lumber prices are several times higher. It owns several mfg plants all over USA. Do you know if it still owns Forest land?"

I?m so sick of you paper handed Sellers giving the stock away at a #$%$ price hold on for a little bit for Christ sake?!
What’s the logic behind this company taking a 30-40% shave in SP due to the virus?? They have more opportunities not less to do what they do and make more money doing it! Doesn’t make sense to me...
"Great Company, with slow & steady stock price rise!!!! I LOVE IT."
"Is the Tangible Book Value per share equal to $13.62? Tangible gross leverage ratio of 9.7 seems a little high. And what is the Book Value of Golden Queen, their associated gold mining company that was valued at debt plus $4.5MM for a 50% interest in the total mine. JEF has less than a 40% interest in the mine. Be careful."

"Considering that at 33.5$, JEF has Mcap: 8.5B$, Enterprise V:30B$. Sumitomo M. buying 5% of the company for 386m$, it values JEF at 7.7B$ (386m/5%). That is a lot lower than BOOK V. (30B$) and less than Mcap. I do not know how to interpret this?.. Does JEF at 33$ is a fair Business Value?... WHAT YOU THINK? I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT."

"10-Q I note with disappointment the significant write downs in their investment portfolios in Vitesse Energy, JETX Energy, The We Company, the Renaissance Plaza in Brooklyn and RedSky Fulton Mall (???); but no mention of Golden Queen. Is Golden Queen still operating? Are they still losing money? Did they report on Golden Queen somewhere else that I missed? HELP! JEF's investment record has been pretty bad. Let's hope it gets better or they stick to what they know."
