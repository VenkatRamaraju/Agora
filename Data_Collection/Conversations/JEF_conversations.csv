CFO died of virus. Rip....
What’s the logic behind this company taking a 30-40% shave in SP due to the virus?? They have more opportunities not less to do what they do and make more money doing it! Doesn’t make sense to me...
Blew away estimates. $1.30 EPS v. .90 estimated.
Looks like brake out. No?
I feel this is a great buying opportunity on the recent pullback.
Bye-bye Shorties￼
Massive volume at the end of the day. We were having a nice day until 3:30. anyone hear of anything?
"Stock is down 20% from 5 years ago. If you are not satisfied, consider voting against management."
Jefferies Financial reached a 52 Week high at 42.04
"Do you know JEF owns 100% of ""Idaho Timber"" ($421 M revenue, $79M pre-tax profit, last year). Now timber/lumber prices are several times higher. It owns several mfg plants all over USA. Do you know if it still owns Forest land?"
All green today $MFA $TWO $NRZ $AGNC $MITT $NYMT $JEF $IVR $XAN
This should go up a lot today. Getting almost $1 billion which is almost 20% of JEF's market cap. National Beef was a huge win for JEF!!!
Jefferies Financial is down 4.91% to 30.23
Moody's affirms ratings of Jefferies (Baa3 senior debt) and its subsidiaries and changes outlook to positive
I bought LUK 20 years ago with the great hope it was truly a baby BRK. WRONG was I.
Jefferies Financial reached a 52 Week high at 43.28
I have been seeing Jefferies listed quite often as the company being used for Bio companies during share issues. Right now there is a lot of Bio corps taking advantage of rising share prices by issuing new stock. Can't be bad for Jef...
NASDAQ website has STRONG BUY.. Target Price is $87.47 for $SNAP based on the these analysts: $JPM $MS $KEY $RJS $TFS $JEF Evercore Oppenhiemer PiperSandler WebBush .. all leading analysts. Fake news my but!!!! Just the facts!!!
Baby Berkshire gets minimal coverage??? Very confusing but great opportunity to continue to build a position into what could become something huge over the years.
This is great company and if interest Rate go-up will benefit. If they raise dividend shares go to 40$ range. Keep E.mailing to Company demanding that you want more dividend. They can effort it as it stupidly buying shares rather than raising dividend! Keep Pressure on.
Up or down big tomorrow ….I say up….
"Considering that at 33.5$, JEF has Mcap: 8.5B$, Enterprise V:30B$. Sumitomo M. buying 5% of the company for 386m$, it values JEF at 7.7B$ (386m/5%). That is a lot lower than BOOK V. (30B$) and less than Mcap. I do not know how to interpret this?.. Does JEF at 33$ is a fair Business Value?... WHAT YOU THINK? I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT."
"JEF is one of the worst stocks I have ever owned. This was a $20-stock in 10/2004. In the past five years, the DOW is up 52% while JEF is down 26%. The CEO, Richard Handler, made $42 million last year. Did any of you attend the last meeting of shareholders? We were told that Wall St. just does not understand JEF and that the stock price should be ""much higher."" One attendee stated, ""JEF is exactly what the stock price says it is."" JEF is losing a LOT of money due to a horrible bet it placed on Spectrum Brands (SPB). I urge everyone to attend the meeting in 2020. Misery loves company."
Today is $MFA day. Also going up $NYMT $TWO $NRZ $MITT $IVR $TRTX $XAN $AGNC $JEF
"Is the Tangible Book Value per share equal to $13.62? Tangible gross leverage ratio of 9.7 seems a little high. And what is the Book Value of Golden Queen, their associated gold mining company that was valued at debt plus $4.5MM for a 50% interest in the total mine. JEF has less than a 40% interest in the mine. Be careful."
A lot of potential here. I'm starting a position in it. Earnings are running hot and will continue that trend this year.
"10-Q I note with disappointment the significant write downs in their investment portfolios in Vitesse Energy, JETX Energy, The We Company, the Renaissance Plaza in Brooklyn and RedSky Fulton Mall (???); but no mention of Golden Queen. Is Golden Queen still operating? Are they still losing money? Did they report on Golden Queen somewhere else that I missed? HELP! JEF's investment record has been pretty bad. Let's hope it gets better or they stick to what they know."
Barrons released an article an hour ago about JEF. Since I don't subscribe I could not read the article but it sounds bullish.
"Great Company, with slow & steady stock price rise!!!! I LOVE IT."
What’s pushing this up? And it’s up about 6 trading day without red close. Very interesting.
"I own the financials.. $GS $C $JEF $COF $BK $BLK ...adding when I can to all of them. $MS is quickly becoming my favorite horse in the race. Additionally, I'll be holding $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT ...probably....forever. gl2a."
"WELL GUYS, 30$+ EASY"
This company won the 123 million dollar DOD contract to fund Apiject for the new coronavirus vaccine. How can its stock not be preforming really well today?
I want to start a position and would like to know wether their dividend is qualified or not. Thanks
Nice inflows the last two sessions! Heading back to the 22 range?
why is this tanking on great earnings?
Jef have any dealings with china?
Jefferies Financial Group was recently dropped from the S&P 500 Index and placed in the S&P Midcap 400 Index. So...the S&P 500 Index funds have been selling it....
Possible Next week $45? Can bank earnings push JEF to $45? Next week? Hope they come out with good reports.
