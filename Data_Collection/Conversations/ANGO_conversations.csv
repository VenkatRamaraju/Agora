Avista still have some 4.5 m shares ... so another two tranches of these to get out. 16 is a lot better than the 14.6 in August. Seems there is demand for the stock even if co needs/wants to buy too.

"Prospective investors should read THIS from the 2018 ASCO meeting:http://abstracts.asco.org/214/AbstView_214_224077.htmlNow, I'm not going into all of the details of what that means, but will note that it implies that the nanoknife COULD be used for conditions such as Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture.

"Down five cents on a terrible day following a significant increase. Nice product announcement and way off 52 week highs. Stock was hit by COVID-19 shutting down ""non-essential"" surgeries which are now back on-line. Hard to believe that the earnings announcement will not be generally positive."

Ango - best looking graphs on the Nasdaq of smaller companies. Just bought more shares. Quiet company doing well. Love it

"I'm not sure what investors who bidded this up to $23.50 were expecting. Same old song and dance. Nanoknife has NOT been approved for a marketable indication. A study is required. It takes time even with the EAP. The best possibly near term catalyst is the sale of several divisions, i.e. ""carve them out."""
