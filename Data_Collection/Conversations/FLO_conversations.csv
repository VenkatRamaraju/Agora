missed EPS by $0.01 and went down 10%...I love it when the market overreacts ..easy money
i wish they announce the dividend today so the stock go up again
I love Tastykakes! I know I should be eating cat food but Tastykakes are the best ever!
"As always with a half decent earnings report,,, the stock sits still! With management owning very little what do they care! They need to get earnings up to par, or sell out! We need an activist here and I mean soon!"
Looks like Flowers just settled the lawsuit yesterday for $300M.
Flowers lost the Olive Garden breadstick account. That’s a huge revenue loss
flowers will not be buying hostess. they already have Tastykake.
America needs good bread & pastries. Flowers has been successful for many years with great fresh products. Let's support American made!
Come on $20
How this Bill. Hope it holds $20. 
Dividend increase announced today.
"The only thing I own that’s up today. Good job, Flowers!"
These things happen when companies hire high dollar management companies to do these elaborate money saving Projects. The easy thing is give early retirement to the high paid people with all the experience and replace them with lower paid personel with no experience. Then home office micromanages areas they no little or nothing about.
FLO always gets good press but can't overcome its selloff. I know some fund was liquidating their holdings but that should be over with. I don't know what their motivation for selling was; the company posted a slight beat in its last earnings and it probably had a good holiday season
divi increase
"Some major fund is exiting their position in FLO, hence the constant dumping at the 22.50 mark, but I don't know why there's a perception that the company hasn't already overcome the woes of second party supply seeing how they beat in their last earnings report"
George Weston Foods based in Canada rumored to be going up for sale. Is this an expansion opportunity for FLO? Weston?s biggest competitor is #$%$ so they may not be a buyer candidate due to anti trade.
"Watch the huge insider selling by Singer and you will know where this stock is headed. He just sold this month for $24.00 a share. They know ahead of time and act accordingly. Do as they do. Click on insider activity for any stock. If they are buying, buy below the price they paid and most of the time you will be safe."
Just can't seem to hold $19.
FLO is up 4.96% to 19.89
"12/18. Fed raises rates. Market sells off. FLO goes up 1.4% on heavy volume (2.5 v. 1.5 avg). FLO: a company providing basic staples, domestically. Yielding nearly 4% with cashflow to cover the dividend. Fuel prices going down and freight competition heating up. FLO is a good place to be right now."

FLO reached a new 52 Week High at 22.17
No word on the June dividend? Usually announced about mid month
"I had calls and sold out for a small profit. I'm going to re-enter in shares one I get cash from other plays.. Good company with brands that I like for a diversified portfolio, IMO"
I only have a few shares. Bread and pastries are not growth industries. Dave’s is a favorite of mine; a great acquisition; and will help sales.
"Geez, Has FLO put more yeast in its products to cause this rise or maybe a little ""weed"" to get it this high ? :- D"
"2/7/19. FLO reported earnings, yesterday. Stock up, today 2.2% on almost triple avg volume on a day that the market sold off. Nice day to be in FLO."
"$FLO announced its annual report today. The earnings reported by a firm often differ from its cash flows. This distinction, referred to as ""accruals"", speaks to the firm’s estimation of profits not yet received. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/FLO. However, managers may make mistakes intentionally or unintentionally in the estimation, making the realization of accruals inconsistent with cash flows. Based on this, whereas two firms report the same earnings, the one with higher accruals would perform worse next period."
divi announcement any day now
"Since I""m the only one here, I'll just say that I'm currently trapped in the red against my cost-basis - very slow-motion and a weak dividend"
"FLO has better buy TWNK while they can,,,, they just had an excellent report ,,, And unlike FLO TWNK Management owns a significant piece of the company and their stock is moving on the report where flo sits still"
"FLO swapping $400,000,000 long term debt at 4.375% for same at 2.4%. That should help the bottom line, even after the brokers get their fees. Some of the restaurants that dropped out due to the pandemic will be back or others will take their place once things reopen."
"Flowers Foods Q4 Adj. EPS $0.28 Beats $0.24 Estimate, Sales $1.02B Beat $989.28M Estimate"
Even with the Soso earnings this management team cannot keep the share price up it fell right back down again after a little spike they need to make an acquisition that’s going to actually do something with the earnings here as I said before TWNK would be perfect we’re talking a lot of revenue here! But don’t forget with the share price going down again management Doesn’t care because they own very little stock HMMMMM!
I would expect a dividend increase announced again in May. Maybe .02 plus per qtr increase this year ?
"What's the upside on FLO? Will it ever have a breakout? I purchased in and am basically breaking even, but they do have strong brands."
Computer trading programs doing their “thing” this morning because of earnings .25 vs .26. Sheesh!
Flowers buying up Daves killer. And canyon bakehouse was a solid move. But at the end of day. It’s the thousands of independent distributors who are out there pushing. Or not pushing sales in their markets who produce to the bottom line. These guys should be the ones who get taken care of and treated as an asset
"why is this going down when bread, etc is consistently sold out at stores due to the virus?"
