FLO to aquire matzah maker part of its wrap rollup strategy. Bwhwhahahaahahha.
"Oh Jason, how are your UNDERWATER shares of FLO the wrap rollup co. with massive debt doing today? Bwhahahahahaaha"
FLO reached a 52 Week high at 24.80
I think the next leg lower will wipe out thomasville and its greasy food. Your thoughts?
"Flowers is soon going to lose the number one spot in the bakery business,,, the new king is going to soon be hostess!"
Up .20 cents at 2:53 p.m. Looks like another good day for us FLO owners. Just keeps getting better. And dividends coming !!!!!
Hostess. Enough said !!! Luck to all!
FLO reached a 52 Week low at 18.50
Flowers has a big problem. Nepotism and good ol’ boy syndrome that puts people in positions where they’re way in over their heads and anybody not a yes sir I’ll follow your lead even tho you’re an idiot is gone. Cut hundreds of jobs and still going South. Used to be about people and family. George Deese stepped down and company cronies got greedy and lost their way.
"Funny...my last post Yahoo deleted the second name ""Grupo #$%$"".......probably why totally self-driving cars will never happen...."
nice day
"Thank you, Jim! Before your latest post, FLO was falling. Please tell us again how you're shorting."
I still say we are going to pursue a hostess aquisition !!!
"Investors, have you noticed that FLO is at the share price it was in May 2014 No wonder you're disappointed."
FLO is up 4.92% to 22.80
"To be honest, given the debate between Jim and everyone else....Flo is somewhere in the middle. It is a rollup company and has been for decades. Nothing necessarily wrong with that in a mature, fragmented industry if you can deliver on synergy and cost reduction. Flo has had issues doing exactly that in recent years, hence the collapse in stock price. Despite multiple ""game changing"" initiatives, costs are rising and revenues flat. In the meantime the balance sheet has deteriorated and the dividend has eaten up an ever greater percentage of FCF. There is some new blood on the BOD but in general, it is ancient and deeply in bed with present management. That said, I have owned this stock three times before in the last thirty years, last sold after the spinoff of Keebler, and have had excellent returns. I bought yesterday at 15.3 and may add to my position.Best,Knowvalue"
"52 week high before earnings, not bad timing"
Tooooooo much nepotism in this company.
Flowers Foods is down 5.39% to 20.70
LOL Jim will be gone now for a while as this stock keeps gaining. Look for him on the next burp we get in the stock price. He will bad mouth a little more then. And run away again after we start moving up. He is very predictable to say the least.
flowers will not be buying hostess. they already have Tastykake.
"FLO has been called by the US Department of Labor for a Fair Labor Review: I think this, more than earnings to be announced later today are causing the sharp drop in FLO's price. The very structure of the company's distribution system is at stake...."
"Flowers will continue to lose market share to twnk in the sweetbread category ,,,, flowers management is taking a do nothing attitude towards this,,,, not a good thing!!!!"
FLO is up 4.94% to $19.77
$15.00 max for this
I'm kinda getting tired of this security going absolutely nowhere.
"FLO has better buy TWNK while they can,,,, they just had an excellent report ,,, And unlike FLO TWNK Management owns a significant piece of the company and their stock is moving on the report where flo sits still"
FLO is down 4.93% to 21.78
Thanks for the easy Georgia Short. You're all the BEST! Got to love slow southerners.
America needs good bread & pastries. Flowers has been successful for many years with great fresh products. Let's support American made!

"move dang it, want my .50 back"
"I don't get why the talking heads like this stock. Their Financials are mediocre at best. Gross Margin is really good, then they spend too many $$$ on SG&A, why?"
FLO will buy twnk I’d bet on it!!
"No Jim. He is so typical for sure. Hold on longs, its getting better. Proven company for sure. And another dividend forthcoming. How can you not like FLO."
Up .06 cents this a.m. with the Dow down. Good sign.
George Weston Foods based in Canada rumored to be going up for sale. Is this an expansion opportunity for FLO? Weston?s biggest competitor is #$%$ so they may not be a buyer candidate due to anti trade.
Why ALL THE MASSIVE insider selling at the end of NOVEMBER?
Ok. Back on track now. Up .28 cents at 11:12 A.M. KEEP IT UP FLO !!!!!!!!
Dividend increase announced today.
"what's the deal, earnings seemed on target"
Waiting for this daily selloff to end... I would expect that the holiday season and the expanse of shut-ins should translate to good sales
"FLO will buy Hostess ,, look for it !"
"Down 13 cents today. Dang, jim must be shorting it some more.Have a great weekend, all!"
"Insiders buying big at FLO, according to thestreet.com. Maybe they know something - like this could be a screaming opportunity."
"Flowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE:FLO) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “sell”"
FLO is down 10.44% to 20.25
"why is this going down when bread, etc is consistently sold out at stores due to the virus?"
i wish they announce the dividend today so the stock go up again
when it hits $30
Thanks for the ride folks. I'm out now. Gonna watch from the sidelines for a while. Like this stock. Just not in this market.
"Worst company in the food business. They outsource many of their jobs at pretty low wages. With unemployment so low, they will be hard pressed to hire and keep good people. I think they will be out of business within a few years. Low margins and not a dedicated work force"
"I think ""Jim"" is back with a new name and better grammar."
divi increase
"Geez, Has FLO put more yeast in its products to cause this rise or maybe a little ""weed"" to get it this high ? :- D"
missed EPS by $0.01 and went down 10%...I love it when the market overreacts ..easy money
What disappointing results.
FLO reached a 52 Week low at 19.46
This is just a trust your judgement call but its time to grab some shares now at these prices. I believe there will be no looking back at the $17.00 a share entry levels.
Terrible over reaction
Get ready for the ride all of us longs because the fun is about to happen. Fasten those seat belts. WE DESERVE THIS !!!!!!!!!
Downgrading to SELL SHORT
"So we are off over 50 cents today ,,,anyone have an idea why?"
Time for it to go up to 26
FLO is down 4.98% to 23.07
Flowers buying up Daves killer. And canyon bakehouse was a solid move. But at the end of day. It’s the thousands of independent distributors who are out there pushing. Or not pushing sales in their markets who produce to the bottom line. These guys should be the ones who get taken care of and treated as an asset
Come on $20
Up .40 cents a share already this A.M. The lows are leaving just like I thought. Buy now if you missed the lows yesterday. I don't think we are looking back any longer. Go FLO. And remember dividends just around the corner.
Looking better up .12 today. I'm hoping for a run now. I think its just the market as a whole holding us back.I'm still holding to my projection of $22.00 by June end of Q2. And that's my gut only talking !!!!!!!!
"FLO is going to make an acquisition,,,,,,,,,, TWNK is my prediction!!!!! We shall see!!!!"
How is this holding up so well? Everything has been selling off
Up even in the days ex-div. Nice!
FLO is down 5.09% to 20.31
"Just a reminder to all . Whats not to like. Keep it coming FLO !!!!!!!!!!!Flowers Foods Declares DividendTHOMASVILLE, Ga., Feb. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Flowers Foods (NYSE: FLO) today announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, an increase of 10.3% over the same quarter last year. This is the 58th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the company and is payable on March 17, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2017."
"The only thing I own that’s up today. Good job, Flowers!"
Flowers Foods is up 4.92% to 21.52
"FLO is a screaming buy, with a sweet dividend to boot. The fundamentals on this thing are excellent. If it gets beat up much more they're going to get bought up or go private. Screaming buy."
Looks like Flowers just settled the lawsuit yesterday for $300M.
Jim were are you ! I want to buy more shares of FLO !!!!
"ARE YOU READY for new 52 week LOWS for FLO? I AM!!! BE PREPARED, BE SCARED(if your long that is!)"

"2/7/19. FLO reported earnings, yesterday. Stock up, today 2.2% on almost triple avg volume on a day that the market sold off. Nice day to be in FLO."
"Think we will ever see another split, anyone?"
FLO reached a 52 Week high at 22.12
"Really bad day, but I believe it will recover"
"Since I""m the only one here, I'll just say that I'm currently trapped in the red against my cost-basis - very slow-motion and a weak dividend"
And again today up .30 cents at 12:00. Keep it up FLO. Dividend's coming Friday !!!!!!!!!!!
dang 62k drops it 2%
Broke over $20 about the time I posted before settling back. Yeah FLO and GSK were my only greenies today. Hang tight & GLTU.
Any idea what the potential monetary hit from the fed govt mafia boys will be?.....
FLO is down -4.90% to 20.56
FLO always gets good press but can't overcome its selloff. I know some fund was liquidating their holdings but that should be over with. I don't know what their motivation for selling was; the company posted a slight beat in its last earnings and it probably had a good holiday season
"As always with a half decent earnings report,,, the stock sits still! With management owning very little what do they care! They need to get earnings up to par, or sell out! We need an activist here and I mean soon!"
"What's the upside on FLO? Will it ever have a breakout? I purchased in and am basically breaking even, but they do have strong brands."
What is going on today?
Are we going Single Digit?
"I’m extremely surprised that equity holders in FLO are content with the mediocre results they keep reporting!!!!! They need to get more cash flow and get the debt down !!! And top management does not own a lot of shares,, always!!! A bad thing!"
I could see a strong push to 19.50 at close
"FLO is a wrap rollup co. going nowhere, its chairman dumped close to 600,000 shares and no insiders are buying."
"Flowers Foods settles upThis is what is reported by Motley Fool which incorrectly reports settlement of sharehoder suit: ""Finally, Flowers Foods rose 13%. The national bakery company, maker of Wonder Bread and other well-known brands, filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday that it had reached an agreement to settle a class-action lawsuit. The suit, certified as a class action in early 2013, concerned allegations that investors had suffered as a result of misleading statements from the company.The settlement involves payment of $9 million, of which almost half will go toward attorney fees. Flowers also agreed as part of the deal to take steps to support Flowers' independent-contractor business model. Current shareholders seemed pleased to have the episode behind them."

Tomorrow morning's drop should be severe. Don't know if it will be though. Poor management and corporate officers have no bread business experience like the old staff did. Bakeries are micromanaged to the hilt.
"Owning little to no stock, such as upper management in this company! Means no caring at all for shareholder return!"
"George Deese, CHAIRMAN dumped shares FACT:Common Stock 08/25/2016 S 235,000 D $15.1641(1) 3,053,625 D Common Stock 08/26/2016 S 227,500 D $15.1135(2) 2,826,125 DAnd that was the LAST transaction by a FLO insider. Dumping SHARES!"
Earnings will probably be a bust again like always this is what you have when management does not own much stock
More insider selling!!!! Why not lol
"Up now at .44 cents at 11:06 A.M. Time is running out at yesterdays lows. Time to BUY, that is if your wanting in at this price, or averaging your existing shares.. I believe we are heading into the $22.00 ranges next quarter. Just a hunch mind you."
Price starting to climb. Time to buy more we will not stay this low much longer. Good luck all longs !!!!!!!!!!
"What is the TRUTH re: many lawsuits against FLO??? What aspect of the ""ID Independent Distributor""were ""mis-represented"" by management???? I studied all areas of website and was actually IMPRESSEDwith the very thorough details and job responsibilities of the ID's representing FLO(very noteworthy infofor those of us NOT in the food ""business"".). So...what are the SPECIFIC areas of lawsuit info that iskeeping the stock price down??? I'm a new shareholder with only a small position. I thought it was VERYinteresting that details about ID showed that the average minimum price to BUY a territory was $100,000.Of course, it then is the ID's business as to how he runs it, but the price for route is very similar to buying a company ""franchise"" (lol....seems to be very little difference here.) Please note: this request for responses is from shareowners who are REALISTIC and knowlegable aboutfacts of FLO and do not SLAM the company....seems like Jason would be realistic, but Jim may be too negative.Just provide HONEST replies...thanks."

Good time to buy more shares

"FLO swapping $400,000,000 long term debt at 4.375% for same at 2.4%. That should help the bottom line, even after the brokers get their fees. Some of the restaurants that dropped out due to the pandemic will be back or others will take their place once things reopen."
The only way to stop losing market share for this outfit is to buy hostess otherwise they are going to keep losing market share to hostess which is posting outstanding results￼!
Inflation fears should help this stock but so far it's in the dumps
"$FLO announced its annual report today. The earnings reported by a firm often differ from its cash flows. This distinction, referred to as ""accruals"", speaks to the firm’s estimation of profits not yet received. see http://www.financial-education-hub.com/1/FLO. However, managers may make mistakes intentionally or unintentionally in the estimation, making the realization of accruals inconsistent with cash flows. Based on this, whereas two firms report the same earnings, the one with higher accruals would perform worse next period."

The current share price Has not moved in a long long time this means no money for shareholders other then the dividend !!! The share price here has got to start moving up and the current CEO just can’t get a grip on how to get this accomplished being that management does not own a lot of stock they really don’t care about the share price only about their salary !!CEO needs to be replaced with someone who cares about shareholder value!!!

"Thanks to Georgia LAW, the Board of Directors of Flowers Foods Inc. is UNTOUCHABLE. Yet they are one of the highest paid Boards of any corporation. Flowers is a wrap and rollup co. Now it faces a potential lawsuit in N.Carolina. OUCH!!!!"
These things happen when companies hire high dollar management companies to do these elaborate money saving Projects. The easy thing is give early retirement to the high paid people with all the experience and replace them with lower paid personel with no experience. Then home office micromanages areas they no little or nothing about.

"Well guys its been nice here listening to all the talk, and talking myself, with our holdings on Flo. I sold mine today at a little lower PPS than I wanted, but was averaged in at just over $16.00 and some change. I had to get the cash for this company's stock. I can't let the stock price in DOW go any higher without buying. It's merger with the iconic DuPont chemical company was approved. This, at least I believe, is going to be huge. And if I wouldn't have bought this last week and the rest today the lows were leaving. Anyway good luck with your holdings of FLO its a good stock for sure, and I have made some very good money on it. Here is today's release on the 130 billion dollar Dow merger with DuPont, just in case anyone would like to read. You might want to consider it. IMHO. See you all later.EU regulators to clear Dow and ChemChina deals next week -sourcesBRUSSELS, March 23 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are set to clear the $130 billion Dow Chemical and DuPont merger and ChemChina's $43 billion bid for Syngenta next week, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The European Commission could announce its approvals for both companies at the same time either on Monday or Tuesday, the people said.It is rare for the Commission to announce joint merger decisions but it probably makes sense in this case as both companies are in the agrochemicals sector, the sources said.Both mega deals in the agrochemicals industry and another one involving Bayer and Monsanto have triggered fears among regulators and farmers that the merged companies may slow down the pipeline of new herbicides and pesticides.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Dow did not immediately respond to an email for comment. A Syngenta spokesman said the Swiss company and ChemChina were confident of closing the deal in the second quarter of the year.The EU antitrust enforcer has set an April 4 deadline for the Dow and DuPont deal, and April 12 for the ChemChina and Syngenta deal.U.S. chemical companies Dow and DuPont managed to address EU competition concerns with a revised package of concessions which included asset sales and transfer of research and development activities to a rival, sources told Reuters last month.ChemChina, which is making the largest foreign acquisition by a Chinese company, won over regulators with its pledge to divest a couple of national product registrations, including existing products and a few in the pipeline, in more than a dozen EU countries, other sources have told Reuters."
FLO will soon buy twnk mark my words
Don’t be fooled by this dog. Dump it even before the dividend
FLO is down 4.97% to 21.22
Why did this get a buy and hold rating and immediately sell off afterward? I bought calls since I expect it to trend back up into the mid 20s and the dividend is around 4% at this level

"I've been accumulating FLO. Ex-div tomorrow, 11/29."
"Another strategic acquisition, filling in a piece of the geographic puzzle."
Get ready for the ride all you long's. The fun is about to happen. The dividends was great also. Good to get free cash.
FLO is down -4.91% to 19.08
No word on the June dividend? Usually announced about mid month
"Strong Buy in the Long Run. Bread can be rather cool in it's affection. How many times have you gone to the grocery before a big winter storm & seen bread on the shelf? This is no get rich quick stock. It's takes time, but when you do get to the finishing line. It will be well worth it."
Even with the Soso earnings this management team cannot keep the share price up it fell right back down again after a little spike they need to make an acquisition that’s going to actually do something with the earnings here as I said before TWNK would be perfect we’re talking a lot of revenue here! But don’t forget with the share price going down again management Doesn’t care because they own very little stock HMMMMM!
FLO is up 4.92% to 21.52
Flowers brands trucks still rolling keeping up with sandwich bread demand (along with Smucker's ?). SYY on the other hand....not so much.
"Jeeeesus, I thought the GOP Congress, House and President would be good for FLO. Guess not. So sad so sad."
"FLO continues to rise in a choppy market ,,,, I still say they will buy hostess!!!!"
FLO reached a 52 Week high at 22.99
"I designed the bread tray for their distribution system in the late 80's that they continue to use today. I've been buying shares this year for the dividend. Needless to say I am disappointed with their performance this year, plus the DOL investigation hanging over this company persuaded me to bail out before the earnings report, which wasn't good. I am looking into the class action lawsuit that has been initiated to look into their securities practices. I am out of this stock at a loss. This business is extremely competitive, and if the route salesman suits have merit, their entire distribution model will be different than what we see today. Private brands like Krogers et al must also be eating into their in store sales, so they are left with fast food hamburger buns with low margins. I've been to headquarters in Thomasville GA. Lots of very smart people there. I'm sure they will find away around this, but I suspect it will take several years."
"It’s time an activist gets in here ,,, share price has been stagnant to long and executives keep making more and more money , get the stock price up or get out!!!!!!"
"The major cause of concern is the labor dispute and Labor Department investigation, including suit by Independent Contractors, Not the class action regarding FLO's disclosure, or lack thereof, of the Labor"
"Anybody buying more? I placed an order at $15.88. Wonder why i bought this stuff at $23. I like Wonder Bread, gotta get the grand kids to eat more Tastekakes"
$13 next leg down. some trying to catch falling knives lose fingers.
Just checked my account. The dividends hit this a.m. GO FLO !!!!!!!!!!! Can't beat it !!!!!!!!!!
"One billion dollar Debt with literally no cash at hand, check balance sheet now"
GO FLO!
"The CEO here has to be replaced ,,,, he is making absolutely no money for shareholders,,,,, share price is stagnant, management does not own a lot of stock! And management makes rediculas high salary’s ,,, this has activist written all over it !! The profit never falls to the bottom line here ,,,,, makes you think !"
JIM ! Were are you ..... I want to buy more :-) LOL
FLO is down 5.39% to 20.70
"I've been watching FLO for a long time and in it for a couple years. This company is a well oiled machine. Probably getting nailed by the Mao, er Obama's, Department of Labor b/c they were outed a year or so ago for donating heavily to Republicans. If you don't think that stuff happens, you're in denial. Anyway, this company is solid as a rock and buying opportunities like this are a blessing. Forget the fluff, look at the numbers, market share, brands, and market opportunities. Look at the dividend history and consistent management. This is not a stock you're supposed to watch daily...this is one you buy, put on the shelf, and collect the divident payments as they continue to methodically grow the company and build shareholder value."
Would love to delete Zacks from my y news feed.
