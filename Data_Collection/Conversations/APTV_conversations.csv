"With 25 years experience in the auto industry, If AAPL or GOOG is smart, it should just buy APTV. Mark this email."
Solid long term investment worth for the future
"Compared to most of the stocks, Aptv shows strength today, solidly climbing"
This stock just got hammered today... https://seekingalpha.com/news/3581337-aptiv-announces-concurrent-common-and-convertible-shares-offering?mod=mw_quote_news
"down from $155 last week Mar 19 to $143 today ... be careful of those ""hedge fund mgr tips"" posts doing pump and dump"
Great stock to hold. Good P/E and very bright prospects
"Anyone out there ...besides spammers??Popping today, looking for a good run soon. Chart looking good. More and more electronics in cars in the future..."
APTIV going to $240-$280....
APTV Will Soar!!
"I hope this stock will go up near the earning days , bought some shares at 121 , but from some days the stock is just dipping . Will rise for sure"
does this company make the safety products and then sell them to the car maker/distributor? do they provide products to Tesla and Google and anyone else? or what exactly do they claim to do for the future of autonomous driving?
Is there a reason behind the recent decline ?
Anyone have any reasons as to why this company seems to be talked about very little?
"--Barclays Adjusts Aptiv's Price Target to $174 From $164, Maintains Overweight Rating. Good news!!"
I'm convinced this will do extremely well in the future.
"Whitney Tilson has an article on TaaS. I can't share it here but he thinks this stock will be part of the TaaS revolution. Aptiv is the dominant company in advanced electrical and safety systems for automobiles. Its largest division is the Signal and Power Solutions business, which accounts for 70% of revenue and 85% of profits.Current analyst estimates for Aptiv are based on the consensus view that there will only be a gradual rollout of both AVs and EVs. If it happens faster, as we expect, the company will be a major beneficiary, and quickly.Buy Aptiv (NYSE: APTV) up to $200 per share."
whats the potential for this stock? ill do my own dd but need some other opinions.
"few analysts have issued updated coverage of Aptiv in the past couple weeks, with a little optimism and some price targets that sound appealing after the fall, with Citigroup calling it a “buy” with a $67 target and Goldman Sachs going to $70 just yesterday, but of course that’s not much solace for those who bought at $90 in January. It’s an odd world when analysts are slashing their target prices by 30% but also giving the stock an “overweight” rating, but I guess you have to make decisions with the price you have in front of you today, not the price of a month or three months ago."
Buying into companies who supply to EV makers. APTV is the best play in this field.
will partner with Apple and Tesla and Hyundai and Ford...and....
"APTV is the dominant player in autonomous car technology - once self-driving cars become more widespread (only a matter of time) APTV could skyrocket to the moon as all the major automakers are starting to use more and more generic parts instead of spending the time and money for R&D to develop many of parts/components in-house. If APTV is able to come out with the best technology for autonomous driving, they could be selling to every major car manufacturer on the planet."
"Can US based investors still buy this stock in a roth or 401K account? With dividends that the company pays, would they still grow tax deffered?"
"An article about Apple Car mentioning APTIV: ""By working with Apple, leaders of Hyundai-Kia believe they will accelerate development of their own autonomous and electric and vehicle plans. Hyundai is currently partnered with Aptiv in a joint-venture developing autonomous vehicle technology, including robotaxis."""
APTV is a steal at this price. Starting another position after taking profit at 168. Might go lower but it will recover strong and fast.
Bought at $60 10 months ago. In it for 3-5 years. EVs will soar. They are a part of it.
what will happen to our DLPH stocks after spin off. Any idea?
Now that the earnings are done with (and they we're great as expected) we can now head to the $150.00 checkpoint.
There are rumours that Apple are going to work with Hyundai on automomous car. You all know that Aptiv is in partnership with Hyundai in this area. Maybe aptv is one of the few stocks in EV market which are still not fully recognized!
She's marching all the way to $280....Congrats everyone....
down on such low volume. any idea what's up on this stock the last 10 days
is this still a solid buy at today's price?
"Anyone have any details and news on aptiv? Conversation board is dead, and only 12 days to earnings call, how is everyone feeling?"
this is the type of stock you buy and don't worry about for 20 years.
The leading company in selfdriving technology?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aptiv-lyft-prove-customers-pay-231900305.html
"Hey Guys, I am looking for a way to invest in autonomous vehicles. Let me know what your favourite stocks are that cover TAAS. Thanks!"
"Why try to guess which EV is going to be the most successful, why not invest in a company that will benefit from the majority of EV's?"
My simple question is when will APTV produce? Seems like they are not executing to their plans from a few years ago. I thought they were planning to provide many automakers with their products by now. TSLA is the buy in this group.
"Aptiv Game plan in a nutshell:First Half 2021 - Launch shared robotaxi service (with human safety driver) with VIA in the US (likely Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas or Santa Monica)2022 - Sell Autonomous tech to.....EVERYONE2023 - Launch fully driverless robotaxi services in major U.S. cities in 2023 with LYFT and take over the worldThe next 2 years is going to be bloody epic."
