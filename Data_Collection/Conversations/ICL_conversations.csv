Sign up to Awesome Stocks and watch their next few plays. I have been impressed so far.
Israel Chemicals is a heavy company which has been losing money for years.There are many problems with their activity in Israel and there is no upside with this stock. I was holding it for 7 years and this is one of the worst investments I have made. In July the stock was trading at 3$ (50% down from the current level) and all analysts gave it a sell rating. I just sold it after a nice rally but still with a big loss. There is no upside but there may be a big downside. You can find much better stocks to have 10%-20% with much less risk.
they need new buyback program
Raviv should go home. he failed.

MOS is down 8% after earnings. I can't understand if it is good or bad for ICL (it is not down for now). Waiting for an opportunity to buy at the 5$ level.
Nice price increase but someone will sell for profit and price will drop. Make money is the name of the game.
