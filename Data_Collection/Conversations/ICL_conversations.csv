Israel Chemicals is a heavy company which has been losing money for years.There are many problems with their activity in Israel and there is no upside with this stock. I was holding it for 7 years and this is one of the worst investments I have made. In July the stock was trading at 3$ (50% down from the current level) and all analysts gave it a sell rating. I just sold it after a nice rally but still with a big loss. There is no upside but there may be a big downside. You can find much better stocks to have 10%-20% with much less risk.
Zach's added this stock to their recommended stocks under $10 list.
ICL is up 4.92% to 4.16
i hope they will increase dividend next quarters. 7c for q are good for me. 28c yearly dividend.

ICL is up 5.13% to 5.03
MOS is down 8% after earnings. I can't understand if it is good or bad for ICL (it is not down for now). Waiting for an opportunity to buy at the 5$ level.
"I think that about 15 Feb, we will see our divi and the price will begin its slow climb back to the $6 range."
Good news on the 4th quarter results good going green now
Just buy and hold.
thanks sellers. i will continue to accumulate.
"Why is this stock dropping like a rock? For some reason, this stock is in a sell off mode even though the write ups have been very good."
Nice price increase but someone will sell for profit and price will drop. Make money is the name of the game.
API anyone?
completly undervalued
"Just when a person thinks this stock might continue to rise, someone sells and the price drops. Still on the cheap."
ICL reached a 52 Week low at 3.81
ICL! Beautyful value stock! Glad i got in
10X vol compared to average in we are just 20 min after the beginning of the day.
People who buy should be in for the long haul and not bail when the price drops.
still so cheap
"Read this article (use google translate) before thinking of buying this stock:https://www.calcalist.co.il/markets/articles/0,7340,L-3898930,00.html"
ICL is up 5.11% to 4.32

I was beginning to think I was the only person on this board. This is a good buy right now!!
why it's going down after good results?
About time this stock stopped the slide and start to rebound.
thank you sellers. will meet at 6.5$ soon
Great news for purchase from India and forth coming quarterly release.
thank you sellers :) with 4-5% dividend this is very cheap stock. bought more.
Now the expected for the year is 6.11. They keep raising it up after the previous expectations are left in the dust.
