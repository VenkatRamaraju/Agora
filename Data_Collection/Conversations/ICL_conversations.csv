Do not quite know what to make of this stock the way it is up and down. Any comments?

Israel Chemicals is a heavy company which has been losing money for years.There are many problems with their activity in Israel and there is no upside with this stock. I was holding it for 7 years and this is one of the worst investments I have made. In July the stock was trading at 3$ (50% down from the current level) and all analysts gave it a sell rating. I just sold it after a nice rally but still with a big loss. There is no upside but there may be a big downside. You can find much better stocks to have 10%-20% with much less risk.
new 2 yr high and nobody here lol

"Just when a person thinks this stock might continue to rise, someone sells and the price drops. Still on the cheap."
