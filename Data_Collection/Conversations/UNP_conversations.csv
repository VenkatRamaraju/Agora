I see a stock split coming soon!
Valuline dumped it
"UNP says that railyard congestion is causing delays, network back-ups and them having to turn down some additional freight business.Hunh. Seems like only yesterday UNP was having a parade for the retiring Jim Vena, who had spent 2 years implementing ""Unified Plan 2020"", the PSR-based strategy for streamlining, improving fluidity and removing bottlenecks from the network. In order to create more capacity to readily handle even more freight volumes.Hunh."
Union Pacific reached an all time high at 234.43
I sold some shares of Apple to average my cost down in $UNP
@Samuel - Everytime Wally speaks UNP goes up - keep talkin' Wally ;)
"@Dennie - and a Happy New Year to you as well :) - many great returns to all at Union Pacific - may all be safe and well in 2021 - and as always - thank you all for what you do.Looking at forecasting for 2021 - wouldn't be surprised at 239 by August and 261 by November. With the facility in Colorado going up this year, and the recovery potentially gaining momentum Q2, this should be a breakout year.GLTA - and stay safe and healthy everyone!"
UNP 1y Target price raised to $250.29 I bought in at $196.70
"Stock split!? Ddi someone mention stock split?! Why, you'll all be rich!! Because....you know....finance!"
"Union Pacific linked to cancer cases in Texas, other states, Bear Cave says - The EPA sent Union Pacific's CEO a 63-quUnion Pacific linked to cancer cases in Texas, other states, Bear Cave says -The EPA sent Union Pacific's CEO a 63-question letter on Thursday askingabout its lack of progress in decontaminating its Houston railyard linked tomultiple cancer clusters and birth defects in an investigation by theDepartment of Health and Human Services in Texas, noted The Bear Cave, whichsaid that its investigation found ""this is not the first time Union Pacifichas been linked to cancer cases,"" including in Illinois, Wyoming and Oregon."
press on ++
I've owned unp since 1980 and they've made me a lot over the years. Last split I believe was close to 300. Very well managed co. I also own NSC.Solid business fundamentals also. I'm a retired BNSF engineer.
"UP is overprice due to its high debt ratios, and Vena (operations wizard) has left the building...so, expect a severe correction down to $117! (;---"
"I worked for Union Pacific for 40 plus years and still don't understand why BNSF carloadings are so much greater then UP this past week they were up 30,000 over UNP"
Since August 12th UNP is down over $20- why? This is over 10% and no one seems to notice as market near peak. Is it the perceived competition from the KSU deal with CP?
Great company. Great stock.
"So after announcing a huge deal to buy KSU...and then having that deal hijacked....and having to wait for the STB to quash that....and raising the bid in the interim...and now looking like they might have got the deal back.After all that, CP and UNP have virtually the same YTD return. About 5%.So.....What has Fritz et all been up to? Or even thinking about doing ? Anything of any consequence? Or have they just been sitting around the boardroom eating Chick-fil-A?Fun trivia: Fritz's salary is about the same as Creel's."
I’m still glad I averaged down under $200. 
CEO Fritz was on Cramer last night (9/27). He acknowledged current issues such as bunching up of shipping containers in LA and Long Beach. This will be an issue for the company until the matter loosens up. Cramer sees a bright future for the company when that happens.
"It's Friday and another gap up day. Very similar to yesterday, a large rising window. which closes as the trading day continues. Take what this market gives you. Maintain your core position, and swing-trade the stock as necessary. Nice price action this week, not bad for what analysts call a neutral rated stock. Long UNP."
"To all on this MB - be wary of the Inverse ETF promoters. They pop up all over the financial MBs - doing their level best to incite panic and wide swings and downs by which they profit. Union Pacific (as previously stated) is a solid ""tangible"" company with ""tangible assets"". Long term investors (as most are that utilize MBs) mostly are trying to exchange ""real"" information regarding their solid investments - making decisions based on information about companies and their financial operations. This exchange is healthy and profitable. The Inverse ETF set are engaged in practices which capitalize on short selling and losses. This protocol is promoted and utilized by short term speculation as opposed to long term investment. Long term investors utilize protocols for conservative continuous returns - as many of you know - this usually involves selling moderate amounts in smaller increments in the future - or involves dividends or distributions (for MLPs).I'm putting this out mostly because of what I've stated before - the more we (investors) know - the more we all win."
Maybe Amazon will buy UNP. Then redesign UNP terminals as giant Whole Foods stores with parcel pick-up.Fritz could be stock shelves. Non-perishable goods only...wouldn't want him near anything that's time-sensitive.
"I guess UNP finally ran out of money for their buyback program, so it will finally drop to 210 where it belongs."
UNP is up to 211.33 it was 196.01 last week. It only needs to go up 17 dollars a share more to be back where it was a month ago.
"""Union Pacific Railroad today announced additional proactive steps to reduce global supply chain congestion, helping restore fluidity for goods and products moving across the United States from West Coast ports..............Union Pacific is just one piece of the supply chain, situated in the middle between ocean carriers, distribution centers, and drayage drivers who control the critical ""first and last miles."" Although the middle miles remain fluid, Union Pacific believes it has a responsibility as a leading transportation company to support and facilitate fluidity at all levels of the supply chain.""-----------------------------Wow...incredible. For starters, Fritz, CP Rail identified the linkage of ships, rail, trucks and customers as all parts of one, fragile supply chain almost 10 years ago, when it set out restructuring the company under PSR. It has been forging coordination and cooperation with all of them ever since, to achieve more efficiencies. It's a core tenet of PSR.UNP's last statement is a mealy-mouthed excuse.....""we're not the problem, everyone else is"". Buck passing. Finger pointing. It's not helpful. It's not leadership. And it sure as he!! ain't PSR.For 3 years, UNP simply implemented a cost-cutting program, and sold it to investors as PSR. But it is precisely this supply chain crisis that has exposed Fritz's lie. He was just peddling jargon, and everyone bought it. Forget about your year-end bonus for a second, Fritz, and get to work on REAL PSR."
Is anybody else buying this stock besides the UNP buyback program?
"Chart looks concerning, it’s broken through every support level"
Anyone buying at these levels? What are our limit orders set at?!
"If you want to see train crashing into cars and trucks and other close calls, check out ‘tech magazine’ on YouTube - very fun. ￼"
"Not seeing many of the ""Choo choo! / All aboard! / No stopping this train!"" sorts of posts lately......wassup?"
Union Pacific reached an all time high at 243.60
Not much stock splitting now a days. Back in the day they were coming fast.Unp Intel Qualcomm Walmart just to name a few . The 90's were fun!
"And so goes another round of ""missed it by that much"". Wally Sparks (our Naysayer-in-Chief) is back again with his usual bag of talking down Union Pacific - only this time he missed the memo that Vena has been Chief Operating Officer since January of 2019. He's already in charge - primarily hired as a former VP of CN - to spearhead PSR. Reason #1 it's important to understand the history of an investment as well as current operations - and to be able to recognize spammers and slammers who's goal it is to cause volatility to bolster their speculative investment actions at every one else's expense."
Sell
Didn’t Wally say it will fall to 117? 
"Christmas & Hanukkah￼ won’t happen unless $UPS, airlines and railroads $UNP is delivering the goods."
I believe the Market is slowing
"A quick comment on a post I saw by Sgockguru a couple days ago. UP ""did not"" drop below its short-term or long-term ""support levels"". The short-term support level is $151.68 and the long-term support level is $150.36. UP shares were around $150 in early January of this year 2019. I said it a few times before, the transportation analysts still have a Neutral rating on all U.S. Rails including the Canadian Rails. I have been hoping for this US/China Trade War issue to resolve itself. This is hurting many U.S. workers and U S companies! My investment thesis with UP has always been, if the biggest U.S. Rail fails, then so will the U.S. Economy, to me there linked. Enough politics. U.S. Derek did you see, even WAB got clobbered on Friday."
"Absolutely brutal. Day after day down. Has anyone seen rail rates lately, huge increases as truck rates are in stratosphere."
wish i bought more. This will be a winner that doesn't need much attention for the next few years.
