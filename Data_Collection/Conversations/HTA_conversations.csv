RE: HTA decline 6/7/2018SPRUCE POINT CAPITAL comments on the management team and the destruction of shareholder value. SPC suggeststhat HTA (MAY) be manipulating SPNOI so that management will earn substantial bonus compensation. Spruce has contactedHTA's Board and requested an audit. SPC is short HTA and suggests there is a 20-40% downside from current prices.The report may by found at Spruce Point Capital Management. There is also an extensive history of Scott Peters and his relationship to the key Board Members and Compensation Board Members. Most have a history of failed REITmanagement positions and several have worked with Peters many times at failed companies. It's not fun reading.
Any know why the stock is dropping?
What was that big drop of .64 all about. Actually a good thing. Now I can buy more!
so explain what's going on at chkr trust with big dividends
"As the stock price keeps declining, I have been adding . History does repeat in this stock. Always seems to drop before earnings."
Hope everyone is enjoying the 52 week hi!
