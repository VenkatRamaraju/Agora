HTA is up 6.18% to 22.18
RE: HTA decline 6/7/2018SPRUCE POINT CAPITAL comments on the management team and the destruction of shareholder value. SPC suggeststhat HTA (MAY) be manipulating SPNOI so that management will earn substantial bonus compensation. Spruce has contactedHTA's Board and requested an audit. SPC is short HTA and suggests there is a 20-40% downside from current prices.The report may by found at Spruce Point Capital Management. There is also an extensive history of Scott Peters and his relationship to the key Board Members and Compensation Board Members. Most have a history of failed REITmanagement positions and several have worked with Peters many times at failed companies. It's not fun reading.
Why is it that every time HTA come close to reaching a reasonable price they annouce to sell x million new shares and the price drops $2-3$3?

"Houston, we have a breakout!"
"From Forbes re: REIT's: Healthcare Trust of America (HTA) is a “pure play” medical office building REIT that operates within one of the most durable categories in healthcare. The medical office sector has some of the strongest fundamentals of any real estate sector in the U.S. Barely a day goes by without a mention of healthcare demand expanding rapidly as a result of an aging population and the Affordable Care Act.Add to that the need (and ability with new technology) for healthcare to shift away from the expensive hospital setting and into outpatient locations, and the demand for medical office space is as solid as there can be.Within the space, HTA is one of the few REITs with the existing property portfolio, management platform, and relationships to take advantage of this growth and produce steady and growing returns.The second-quarter (earnings results) was strong: 3.1% same-store growth – its 15th straight quarter over 3%; $435 million of acquisitions YTD; and continued expense efficiencies on both the operating and corporate overhead fronts, where it continued to demonstrate its ability to scale by driving G&A as a % of revenue down.Since 2006, HTA has tripled investors’ money. With a focus on a great sector and a national platform in place, the company should continue to perform for investors in the future. We are maintaining a BUY rating, with an overweight in our Durable Income Portfolio."

Fear of higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Generally REITs have pretty sizable debt loads including our HTA. Higher interest rates mean less profit for us unless mgmt can overcome it by increasing revenue. We shall see...
this stock cant get out o its own way. been trading in this range since the reverse split
