"""jmdbro4 hours agojust as you keep proving you are the master baiter""KOH, I spent about 30 minutes yesterday reading post of yours that I have saved to a word document. It would be obvious to any sane person who has read your post from over the past several years to conclude that you have some serious problems. You need to get help with your problem and a yahoo message forum is not the place for that. You need some good professional help.Good luck."
Sold 2 Jan '24 $27.50 puts for $1.15.
"""I can reply to you all day,"" Sure you can and that is fine with me. All your post reveal a little about your character and life style. There are writings that are 2500 years old that talk about the very things you are guilty of. You might want to take some time and read a little. You have not changed since I read your post for the first time about 14 years ago. Keep up the good work."
Is this a time when there is blood in the water and you should be HUNGRY? My order at 58.75 filled. Unknown why the market is up 300 points and this is getting hammered/ beaten down 4%? Is a stock at a PE of 12 a 3% divi payment and making money hand over fist a bad thing now? While companies with 100 dollar per share stock prices no divi and losing money hand over fist a good thing?
"still taking the bait. Easy catch.""Don't worry, you have no clue about my characterand lifestyle because I've concealed it all these years.""You have not concealed what I saved to word documents. LOL LOL LOL"
"KOH, before I ever looked at the USB forum I followed 2 boards with very good posters who were respectful to each other and shared information. The first thing I saw when I came here was you and KOH Jr. trashing other posters. I figured you out to have a lack of character, a lack of respect for others and an ego bigger than a elephant. You have not let me down with your hundreds of post over the years. I miss your trash when you don't post.Thanks and keep posting."
Been a terrific stock. Got in for the first time during 2020 and am totally glad I did. Will hold until death us do part.
"For readers who read financial post.""US Bancorp acquired MUFG Union Bank to increase its presence in California.State Street bought the custody business of Brown Brothers Harriman, making it the world's largest custodian bank.Both US Bancorp and State pay attractive dividends.Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy AlertTwo major financial companies just raised their dividends in the past few days, and those increases were accompanied by more good news -- acquisitions that should better position both of them for future growth.One of those companies is US Bancorp (NYSE:USB), which acquired another bank to expand its geographical footprint, and the other is State Street (NYSE:STT), which bought a rival to make it the world's largest custodial bank. Let's take a look at how these moves should benefit these two stocks.US Bancorp buys MUFG Union BankUS Bancorp, the holding company of US Bank, the fifth-largest bank in the country, just got a little bigger with the acquisition of San Francisco-based MUFG Union Bank. US Bancorp bought the bank from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group for about $8 billion. It has about $133 billion in assets and 342 branches -- 315 of them in California, with most of the rest in Oregon and Washington. Further, the acquisition adds 1 million individual customers and 190,000 small-business accounts, while boosting the balance sheet with $58 billion in loans and $90 billion in deposits. The purchase will bolster US Bank's already-solid position in California, making it the fifth-largest bank in the state in terms of deposits, up from 10th.US Bancorp projects that the deal, after it closes in the first half of 2022, will be about 6% accretive to earnings per share in 2023 assuming a 75% integration by then, and 8% accretive when fully integrated in 2024. The bank expects to realize $900 million in cost savings, or about 40% of estimated noninterest expenses, through real estate consolidation, technology and systems conversion, and other back-office efficiencies.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4456398-u-s-bancorp-usb-u-s-bancorp-to-acquire-mufg-union-bank-transcript This should help the performance of one of the nation's more efficient banks, with an efficiency ratio (how much a bank spends to generate $1 of income) of 58%, among the lowest of the major banks. Meanwhile, the acquisition also should boost return on tangible common equity, at 21%, also among the best of the nation's biggest banks. It currently has an operating margin of 42%, which is higher than every major bank"""
"Hit a double today, S&P and NASDAQ both closed at record highs. Will the need for higher yields slow the pace down? FWIW"
"For those who use this for financial info.U.S. Bancorp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2011, the dividend has gone from US$0.20 to US$1.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 25% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.U.S. Bancorp Could Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that U.S. Bancorp has grown earnings per share at 7.8% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time. FWIWSimply wall st."
Why this selling pre market?
Thanks for the dip!!!!
Why did USB-PH drop 255 cents at close today given such a rosy outlook for parent USB?
Looks like USB is using cash and stock to get in the merger game. I hope this does not turn out to be a bad deal. FWIW
"Got him again. When someone lives in fantasy land they are an easy target and and always grab the bait. Thanks little man, good to see your post."
What is going on today? I can't find any news on USB. We are dropping 3X the sector. What's gong on?
Earnings were great! Why the downside?
"It appears USB will be acquiring MUFG Union Bank at a slight discount compared to other recent deals knowing it may have a few extra (FUTURE) expenses cleaning things up.From a Bloomberg story found below Y.F. quote:""The sale is estimated at about 1.3 times MUFG Union’s tangible book value, according to the statement. U.S. banks have sold at a median 1.4 times book value this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.""""The Japanese bank’s U.S. unit on Monday received a cease and desist order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which cited the bank’s “unsafe or unsound practices” regarding technology and operational risk management, as well as noncompliance with security standards.U.S. Bancorp “evaluated and incorporated these regulatory concerns into all aspects of the deal process,” it said in the statement. “The company believes it can successfully remediate the issues applicable to MUFG Union Bank in connection with the transaction, and that the order will not restrict U.S. Bancorp’s ability to operate and grow its business as planned.”"""
This is the best bank. I don’t think the downside today is justified. Warren Buffett likes it
Terrific earnings and… kapow.That’s the market today. Good is bad and bad is good
"when in the Financial crisis 2018, the only bank stock not dropping was Union Bank, planning being acquired! (my recollection)"
Another double today. DOW @ S&P up for 4 straight weeks.FWIW
Lots of TV talking heads spinning this one.I own PRU with its 4.6% div.
Busting through 60 again today
"The price volatility around expiring option strike prices is quite intriguing.The stock price weakness does not correlate to the current and future forecast, especially, when comparing to the top five. The climate is still positive. USB, basically, performed as expected for the quarter, yet its stock price has been punished. It’s hard to fathom what performance was expected to justify this price drop.Maybe the new purchase is weighing on future expenses?"
This is going to 80
Quiet board. This is nice.. looking forward to tomorrow’s news
Back on track
"Things are still positive.U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday as investors digested another round of upbeat corporate earnings results. The Dow rallied 382 points, extending its weekly rise to 1.6% and closing within 1% of its August 16 record high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8%, capping its second consecutive weekly gain with a 1.8% uptick. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%, extending its weekly advance to 2.2%, its best five-day stretch since August."
"After everyone dumping after the earnings, showing GREAT support at 62, a very positive sign! Good article about USB's future in the news section today too!"
Still swinging and playing. Your easy to catch. BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
"Nice close today. Nice divy coming soon as well. Financials look good and should outperform, near term. Sounds like a good acquisition, strengthening USB presense on the West coast. USB and its former self. FBS, was well known for profitable acquisitions and smooth transitions thru the merger mania of the 90's. Hope that continues thru the next growth period!"

"Home sales are still strong. Should be a good indicator. FWIW+In the South and Midwest pending home sales respectively rose 8.6% and 10.4% last month from July, while sales increased 4.6% in the Northeast and 7.2% in the West. Nationwide, contract signings were down 8.3% from the same month a year ago, an expected drop since there was a surge of activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Pending sales in recent months have run above the level implied by mortgage applications, probably because the proportion of cash buyers has increased,” said Pantheon Macroeconomics in a research note prior to the results. “We have no reason to think that cash buyers disappeared in August, so we look for another overshoot in pending sales.”According to the NAR, 22% of all existing sales in August were completed by all cash buyers.The rebound in activity was surprising to some experts who thought rising home prices would deter buyers. The median existing-home price for all housing types in August was $356,700, up 14.9% from August 2020, as prices increased in all four regions of the U.S., the NAR reported last week.Yun noted that affordability “remains challenging as home price gains are roughly three times wage growth.”However, some relief in inventory will likely slow down record-breaking home price growth. Total housing inventory, or homes available for sale, at the end of August totaled 1.29 million units, down 1.5% from July’s supply and down 13.4% from one year ago. According to Yun, inventory is still tight but the declines are not as severe. By December or January 2022, he expects inventory ""to turn the corner and increase."""
"USB approaching all-time highs, pretty much matching the sector avg and the market today. With an increasing 10yr T, and Fed tapering with FF rate increases soon to follow, the future looks great for USB shareholders! Increasing profit margins. Analyst Targets at 65 short-term, with 70 in the future in early 2022, outperforming other banks as Financial stock investors discover this gem."
Thank God earnings didn't come out when the Dow was in a tail spin.
Article in MF on USB acquiring MUFG that is a good read for those who follow financials. FWIW
