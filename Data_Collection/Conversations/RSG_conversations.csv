"Itronics Discovers Strong Evidence Of A Tertiary Polymetallic Low Sulfidation Gold System At Its Auric Fulstone Gold Silver Zinc Copper ProjectRENO, Nevada, March 05, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) an “Innovative Zero Waste” technology company that produces GOLD’n GRO fertilizers, and silver products, today reported that its subsidiary Whitney & Whitney, Inc. has identified strong evidence for a Tertiary polymetallic low sulfidation gold system at the Auric Gold & Minerals, Inc. Fulstone Gold Silver Zinc Copper exploration project in the Yerington Mining District in northwestern Nevada.The newly identified mineralization is in a valley which is being named “The Golden Valley Prospect”. The Golden Valley Prospect samples are indicating strong gold mineralization accompanied by anomalous silver, zinc, and copper. There is a zone of anomalous gold, silver, and zinc mineralization about 1,000 feet to the north of Golden Valley that is about 1,000 feet by 600 feet in area and a zone of intensely bleached and altered rock about 500 feet east of Golden Valley that is about 1,000 feet by 2,000 feet in area. Both of these zones are believed to be associated with the newly discovered mineralization in Golden Valley and are potentially all part of the newly identified mineralization as described below. The Golden Valley Prospect is the third gold occurrence to be identified in the Buckskin Range and is the second surface occurrence. The first is a high grade gold-copper surface vein system at the Buckskin Mine about six miles to the south that was discovered in the early 1900’s. The second is a deep high grade copper-gold system about 3 miles to the south that was discovered by Anaconda Copper in the early 1970’s, but that was not developed. Field examination of a Landsat color anomaly in Golden Valley on which a significantly anomalous gold-in-soil sample was taken revealed a strongly clay-altered and heavily limonite-stained intrusive andesite porphyry subcrop-probably a leached cap, which is so strongly jointed as to appear shattered- adjacent to weakly-stained calc-siltstone. A part of this color anomaly was tested with two traverses of soil-plus-rock samples. The traverses were comprised of 50 foot spaced samples on a 350 foot long Northeast-Southwesterly line, and on a 400 foot long Northwesterly-Southeasterly line, including rock/soil sampling, in the fall of 2018.Multi-element analyses of 17 follow-up soil plus rock Golden Valley samples indicate that all “grab” samples of the andesite porphyry leached cap and calc-siltstone are anomalous geochemically in gold, silver, zinc, copper, and gold-pathfinder/indicator elements, and potassic clay alteration. All samples showed ppm-detectable gold- with two adjacent samples on altered porphyry showing 14.05 ppm and 0.15 ppm gold. An additional 14 altered porphyry samples and one siltstone sample assayed from 0.006 ppm to 0.058 ppm gold and averaged 0.022 ppm gold. In addition to the gold assays, average values for several gold pathfinder elements indicate an epithermal, low-sulfidation, polymetallic gold system. >>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/030519.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsinc Follow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsincVISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comThe following link is to a segment done on Itronics by KOLO8 News: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYG0CIPEy1o"

(OTC:ITRO), an “Innovative Zero Waste” Technology Company that produces GOLD’n GRO fertilizers and silver products, today reported that its popular 2009 Limited Edition Silver Nevada Miner bars, an excellent collectible and a souvenir of the Silver State, are now available through its subsidiary, Itronics Metallurgical, Inc. Order by calling Itronics Metallurgical, Inc. at 1-800-368-1865.“The 99.9 percent pure, 5-troy ounce silver bar is one of the most attractive being manufactured and marketed in the United States today and is a unique and beautiful collectible,” said Dr. John Whitney, Itronics President. Itronics Metallurgical began offering these yearly dated bars in 2001. Production was discontinued in 2008, but many collectors have requested that they be brought into production and the series continued. Many people collected each year and a small trading market exists on E-Bay. Itronics plans to complete the series to the present and then to continue for the indefinite future.Production of the Silver Nevada Miner Bars was discontinued in 2009 due to extreme volatility in silver prices. Silver prices have now stabilized at much lower levels. “In 2018 we have received so many requests from collectors that we made the decision to continue the bar series with the 2009 bar and moving forward to the current year,” said Dr. Whitney. “We plan to produce 1000 bars for each of the past years. When the 2009’s are sold out we will produce the 2010 bars and continue to the present until they are caught up. The limited numbers being produced and sold should ensure continuing value for collectors.”The Silver Nevada Miner bar was created to commemorate the long and eventful silver mining history of Nevada and is an excellent souvenir of Nevada, which is known as the “Silver State.” The bars are 2 3/8 inches by 1 3/8 inches and ¼ inch thick. Each contains exactly 5-troy ounces of pure silver. The bars are “proof quality” and include a year-stamp authenticating the limited edition.The top surface of the bar is engraved with an authentic reproduction of a miner in one of the famous “square-set stopes” of the Comstock Silver Mines at Virginia City, Nevada, in the mid-1860’s.

"""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future Plans“Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) and its President John Whitney have always envisioned a clean, waste-free planet. Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

"Itronics Reports 2018 Year End Results; Updates Operations Expansion and Diversification ProgressRENO, Nev., April 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) a Greentech Fertilizer, Silver, and Mineral Producer, today summarized its operations and diversification progress and announced sales results for the fourth quarter and full year which ended December 31, 2018.Itronics' Total Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $302,598 compared to $419,231 in the same period in 2017. Total Revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,312,848 compared to $1,850,573 in 2017. As previously reported, fertilizer sales were down significantly due to poor weather in the first half of 2018. The outlook for fertilizer sales in 2019 is for a substantial increase, driven by a strong marketing program which was started in the fourth quarter 2018. First quarter 2019 sales were up more than 50 percent compared to the prior year’s first quarter. The outlook for silver sales is for an increase due to stabilized pilot scale circuit board refining operations, and a contribution from the newly introduced “Silver Nevada Miner” 5-ounce collector bars. A silver bullion shipment was made in January 2019, and “Silver Nevada Miner"" 5-ounce collector bar sales began in February 2019. The year 2018 was pivotal for Itronics as it continues implementing long term diversification and expansion based upon increasing GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales, expanding its “Breakthrough Technology” printed circuit board refining operations, planning staged implementation of operation for other technologies within its portfolio of “Zero Waste Technologies,” and establishing a development plan for its Auric Fulstone silver gold zinc copper exploration project in Nevada. Following is a summary of the Company’s accomplishments in 2018, in order of their importance for the Company’s diversification and expansion:In May the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement to purchase a 48-acre manufacturing site at Wabuska, Nevada that includes 60,000 square feet of buildings and a rail siding to be used as an expansion property. The Company plans to initially use this site to expand its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer manufacturing operations to be followed later by circuit board refining and other metal recovery operations.In early October the Company announced that it had expanded its GOLD’n GRO fertilizer sales team by hiring an experienced sales manager to lead the sales effort and launching an expanded marketing program to introduce the GOLD’n GRO fertilizers to a larger customer base.During the year the Company completed important steps in perfecting its pilot scale printed circuit board refining operations. In March the Company announced that it had taken delivery of a commercial scale e-scrap grinder for grinding shredded circuit boards (e-scrap) to feed its refining furnaces. In June the Company announced that using circuit board feed for its refining furnaces that is being ground up by the new e-scrap grinder made it possible to increase the per melt yield by more than 50 percent. The silver content per melt was also increased by 50 percent.In November the Company installed and successfully started up a centrifuge whose purpose is to significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost to perform liquid/solids separations in its hydrometallurgical processing of certain silver-bearing feed materials for the refining operations. The expected benefits are being achieved, making this an important process technology breakthrough for the Company.A confidential Fulstone Project report was updated in early January 2018. The updated report identifies five target areas and recommends a 10-hole investigative drill program consisting of two drill holes for each target area. In October the Company announced the discovery, by surface sampling, of surface 0.4 troy ounce per ton gold at one location and five percent copper at another location at the Fulstone Project. The gold was found within one of the five identified target areas. The copper was found at a location that extends a previously identified mineralized zone by 2000 feet from 5,000-foot strike length to 7,000 feet strike length.>>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/041219.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsincFollow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsinc VISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comContact:Paul Knopick888-795-6336"

"It appears that RSG is not commenting about nor is the market reacting to RSG's potential liability for radioactive waste (interestingly, not reported by Yahoo). See ""Missouri residents sue over radioactive material storage sites"" BY Reuters— 10:55 PM ET 02/20/2018 Feb 20 (Reuters) - Residents living near landfill sites in the St. Louis area where radioactive waste has been stored filed lawsuits on Tuesday seeking compensation, claiming negligence in handling materials they said were some of the most dangerous on Earth. Two lawsuits seeking class action status were filed at St. Louis County court for sites that included the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri, and an area near the Coldwater Creek in the county. Among the 10 defendants are Republic Services (RSG), Exelon Corp (EXC) and the Cotter Corp. Officials from those companies were not immediately available for comment. ""Defendants treated these hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic, radioactive wastes with about the same level of care that a reasonable person might give to common household garbage, dumping it without authority from the State of Missouri and in violation of law,"" the lawsuits contend. The suits did not state an amount being sought by the plaintiffs."
