"Still holding long, I think this company has a great future. Especially while taking in to account that there is currently less than 2% of drinkable water left on our planet... people can love without cloth or with-ought homes with ought cash but hell no one can make it without water... so... I am long on WTER"
Water added to 350 GNC stores nation wide. News out 2 hrs ago.

"like I said Shaq has already and pretty much priced into the stock. That's why you don't see a huge movement today. The real meat and potatoes is in the Q3 and Q,4 reports.."
"After 6 months they finally make their move, just today they made their announcement. I expect a big jump. Let's see how the market re-act the next few days, not looking good the first 30 minutes ... Let's the game begin."
"I think they'll do great in California with this product. I, personally, love the vessl cap...it screams freshness, freshness, freshness!"

"Bobby Lee, the other day you asked about the flavored water (A88 Infused Beverage) co-packers. Specifically you were concerned with continued outages displayed on the companies website.I'm not done researching yet, but I wanted to provide what I've found so far.1 - I believe that Waco Bottling in Waco, Texas is currently the only co-packer. If I find out differently I'll advise accordingly.2 - Per the 10K/A for year end 03/31/2021 the company has plans to add 3 - 5 co-packers for expected increase in flavor water sales.Any future comments will be added to this post for convenience.I hope this helps."
for all those waiting for Shaq NBA season started yesterday Shaq will be on TNT very soon with a bottle in his hand. Also it doesn't hurt to get on his Twitter handle and tell him to start pumping the stock :-)
"10 Compelling Reasons to long WTER.1. The largest Shareholder is Shaq.2. State of the Art Technology that doesn't use Chemicals. Huge advantage over the competition.3. 89% compound annual growth rate over the past seven (7) years with no traditional advertising.4. Infused products will add revenue in 2022 by a substantial margin.5. #1 most efficient water company generating $2 million in revenue per employee; industry average is $220,000 per employee.6. Expansion into Mexico and Canada will generate massive revenue over the next three (3) years.7. Eight (8) Co-Packers strategically placed throughout the United States saves a significant amount in transportation costs.8. Prime Acquisition Target. Vitamin Water was purchased for $4.2 Billion. Alkaline88 is much more diversified that any and all recent acquisitions by Big Beverage. BodyArmor handed it's shareholders a 3,200% return. WTER market cap is a measly $169 million; this is laughable.9. WTER is fortunate enough to be part of a MEGA-TREND with consumers drinking less soda. This bodes extremely well for WTER.10. Food for thought. If WTER is bought for $3 Billion in a year or two, based on WTER's total outstanding 104.2 million shares, a $3 Billion acquisition price puts WTER at exactly $28.79 a share. If this number is cut in half, WTER will be acquired for $14.40 per share making the acquisition a measly $1.5 Billion. If WTER is purchased for the exact amount Vitamin Water was purchased for, the share price of WTER would be exactly $40.31. These are statistical facts; not opinion. WTER, the Best is Yet to Come. Buying and Holding WTER is a no brainer."
I just saw Alkaline88 in Lidl stores LI NY.
that spike to 1.73 looks like a big buy. .. Gonna do some research but volume could be big tomorrow.
I fully expect the company to eventually be bought out by Pepsi or Coke.
cute commercials!
"The ""Shaq factor"" article. https://www.valuethemarkets.com/2021/10/01/fast-paced-growth-and-the-shaq-factor-prime-this-enhanced-water-firm-for-expanded-reach-and-range/"
"sometimes I catch myself being a little negative at this stock, well because if you've been in this for a long time like me there has been ups and downs and and a lot of disappointment. However I have to remind myself that those days are over and all the waiting is about to pay off. so I apologize if I came off negative about shaq's commercial I'm just excited as everybody but I also don't want everybody to get their hopes up if we don't skyrocket right away, and then get disappointed and sell. However time is definitely on our side, we have finally turned the corner and all the longs will be making alot of money very soon .. Poor Tam GA "

I'll say it again The stock was up to $2.25 less than 2 months ago without shaq's advertisement. Shaq is just going to be the cherry on top that pushes this over $3 and hopefully gets us a buyout very soon.Don't be a naive and think Coca-Cola has not been paying attention to all the work alkaline is done this last month. I guarantee they are going to want to buy out the number one independent alkaline water company for another company gets their hands on it. TRUST THE PROCESS HOLDING IS FREE
"As these commercials get out, hopefully it generates some excitement in this stock again. alkaline water company and the Clean Beverage company, is pleased to announce that Shaq’d-up commercials for Deliciously Smooth Alkaline88 are now being broadcast. Consumers will see the advisory board member and beloved brand ambassador, Shaquille O’Neal, and Alkaline88 in multiple formats across all media channels including 30-second and 15-second commercials on digital platforms and television."
