Nothing like giving back all our gains from last week in one day.
Buyout rumors are swirling?
Called that price pretty good today. it's Friday tomorrow so realistic prediction because of selling will be around 1.80 before close. GL WTER family

Power close please!
"Just curious as of 11:51 AM EST, Day's Range 1.6200 - 1.7000, and it closed Friday at 1.70, so after-hour and pre-market did not even move 1 penny!!? We are losing in real time. Where is Shaq?"
"Happy with the report. Will be watching for further expansion in the price-club, CBD and single serve segments."
nice consolidation. I expect a big week next week.
This is completely normal always before earnings trying to shake off the paper items like Nate.
looking like 2.50 by Friday for sure.
"Since July 28, it went as low as $1.72. So the summer is almost gone and we are at $1.66 (the lowest since 7/28/2021), where is Shaq? Where is the pop of the summer?"

Look at the 10K.Anyone on this board can ask management on the conference call.Many of our newfound ""investors"" (that makes me laugh) are going to be very disappointed."
"Omni-channel advertising w/Shaq, broke into the club market, new CBD waters with the Vessl tech. Costco placement and PepsiCo buyout coming soon. Attaboy!"
Holiday Hydration gift box coming soon? Television? Radio? Social Media? I like the idea!
Let’s be honest. This thing is going to get bought…..soon. I’m all in and hodling.
Good morning!
"Don't want to go to the moon, just $3 per share, is this too much to ask. Can we send Shaq packing?"

SHAQ just did a Tik Tok with Alkaline88!!
Wter was just added to the CSE composite 25 index.
Expect a decent gain back in AH. I think the shorts have beat it down as far as it can go to. 175 seems to be strong resistance. I definitely expect a Green Day tomorrow
Good morning Water World !
I could see the stock going to $19
Bullish
Finally something that will move SP back up. Company still needs to show they can be profitable All 587 Sam’s Clubs in the Continental U.S. Will Carry Alkaline88’s Single-Serve 1-Liter 12 Pack
Beautiful bounce back so far. Shaq starts marketing next month....Get ready and bucket up!
"Tutorial time (for anyone interested).10K - Annual report from a publicly listed company. This is the Holy grail for useful information related to the reporting company. It contains financial statements, management discussions, exhibits (item 15) and almost anything else you may want to know about said company.10Q - this is a quarterly report which is provided 3 times a year. It's similar to 10K, but provides much less details.Form S-3 registration statement - it's used to inform shareholders of the BoD desire to sell additional stock. Mainly to fund operations, etc.Stockholders equity section of the balance sheet. Here you will find what types of stock have been approved by BoD, retained earnings or deficit (obviously not good), Treasury stock and things of that nature.Each approved stock (preferred and common) consists of 3 types of classification - authorized, issued and outstanding.Authorized - the maximum number of shares that can be sold by company without further approval which requires amendment to articles of incorporation.Issued - in general this equals the outstanding count. Outstanding - total number of shares issued and sold.Treasury stock - shares that are repurchased by the company which are NOT cancelled. They can be used for stock options, warrants or resold.That's all for now."
HOLD ! 
What happened to Liquid?

"Another dilution of shareholder value. 83,000 shares. Looks to be some type of equity bonus granted prior. Not sure why a company that has not yet learned to make money is giving out bonuses. For me I made a decision to stay in until the effect of the National Marketing is realized. Better be good."
"Just looked at Q1 2021 presser from last year, says record revs of $14.2m. Now, Q1 2022 presser says record revs of $14.1m. Actually growth is slightly negative. How then can they state 5% y over y growth and 19.6% growth on two-year stacked basis (whatever that means LOL)?"
"@Tam GA...how can investors know how bad they are if they've never heard of them? The price can't go up until people know who they are. AND, how will investors know who they are???? BY getting the f'in commercials out!"
Last two days allowed me to get some of my position sold at $2.10 spike the other day. Thinking we would see some consolidation before next leg up. July sales results at coming earnings call and the National ad campaign details will be the boost that jumps the SP again.

"Wter is down almost 7% today. Why, what has changed in the company from say, last week? Nothing. Am I missing something?"
"Found A88 @ Ralph's in Pacific Palisades, CA ... only one big jug was left!"
You guys know I've been here for awhile (I was Space OG also) and I have to admit I am thoroughly confused on what is going on lately with this stock. there seems to be nothing but great news everyday and today was one of the biggest days for news but yet no momentum whatsoever. so my only conclusion is the stock is being heavy manipulated right now. I'm going to hold like I've been doing for the past couple years but if it dips back under a dollar I'm going to strongly consider getting out I have to admit it finally. Yes it's a red day in the market and I know I'm the one that usually preaches that but there's a lot of stocks that have momentum and are going green today alkaline 88 should be one of those. Don't get me wrong I'm still in love with this stock but red flags signaling manipulation by Hedge Funds are going up now.
I bought a gallon on A88 at a Rite aid in Michigan. Only a few left on the shelf

There should be a shareholder vote coming soon.It's needed to approve another stock and warrant offering. The approval is required by 09/30/21 Vancouver Canada time.I've notified everyone on here before. However with all the excitement in the beautiful videos posted here I'm sure no one remembers.How does nonsense video help anyone understand this company ?
"Go Go Go , I want this company in The News !!!"
All good 
looking for a nice bounce in the power hour
Had a feeling might be a red day after the huge run-up early. Still in great shape don't sell.
will someone buy them out or no?
We have a WTER leak. Someone repair this leak please
"Started drinking this a year ago , had no Idea it would help with gout flare up. I'm a fan and purchased my 1st 15 shares today."
"Ok, getting my feet wet here. Betting SHAQ will be doing national campaigns that got Sam’s Club on board."
I still feel good about this.

Bullish. Finally
Yahoo posting 4 days to earnings call now. However nothing on WTER investor relations site IR calendar.
Nice again. Back to $2.00. 
Amazing the amount of effort shorts put into making the stock go down before close.

Well maybe buck 55 will be the low today.
"Just released,SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline water company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that this year’s sales in the all-important C-Store channel have more than doubled over the previous year. The Company attributes much of this growth to partnerships with several new major Direct-Store-Delivery providers and additional placements in six new distribution centers of legacy partners.“Our C-store channel sales are beginning to grow significantly. Last month alone, we grew by almost 300% in c-store sales, making it by far our most successful month in the company’s history. This is before the full impact of any of our new DSDs or six new distribution centers has even been felt,” said Richard A. Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “The Alkaline88 footprint continues to expand with each new distribution center added to our nationwide network. Recent additions to our network of distributors include Nassau Candy, Cooper Booth Wholesale, Hensley Beverage Company, Nevada Beverage Company, and National Convenience Distributors. Combined with our legacy partners, our network’s access now gives us the potential to service approximately 50,000 of the 150,000 convenience stores across the country. Between our traditional channels and C-stores, our single-serves are now available to more customers than ever before. Many of our single-serve SKUs, including our aluminum bottle and many of our flavored-infused waters, are on pace to significantly outperform their sales from last year. The C-store channel is a leader in bottled water sales with over $4.5 billion in sales last year, according to Convenience Store News. While we continue to see significant growth in our traditional channels, we anticipate that the convenience channel will meaningfully contribute to our fiscal year 2022 sales revenues.”"
"Some USEFUL INFORMATION follows for those interested.Apparently co-packers have their own water sources. In my initial research of WTER beginning on the holiday of 07/04/2021 (TamGA and Bobby Lee may remember this) I was unaware of where WTER obtained their water supply. Since then I've researched 2 of the recently hired co-packers (1 in Virginia and 1 in Florida). The Florida location will be supplying Sam's Club with WTER products. They provide an end-to-end solution and they do it expediently (turnaround time is 3 - 5 days). This includes making the bottle and label, producing the water and shipping it. That's good because Wal-Mart/Sam's Club are demanding retailers. WTER will only need to supply the Himalayan rock salt.I believe Wal-Mart only sells the gallon sized plain product currently. If co-packers performance meet their claims listed above both retailers may expand their offering of the myriad products of WTER. That would be an EXCELLENT ACHIEVEMENT."
I'm all in when it hits .90
Beat down by shorts all day and bounce back like a champion.... You want to know why???
My guess is Tam GA and Larry have short calls around the 1.60 mark and are losing very bad 
"What concerns me... I live in aurora Indiana 50 miles west of cincinnati,oh. The krogers in lawrenceburg is out of the water more often than not. I like that their expanding but they have to keep their current customers stocked. Krogers wont hesitate to fill the shelves with their own products."
The biggest error most investors make with wter and others in this part of their growth is they place too much value in how much cash the company is making . They fail to recognize the value of an aggressive roll out campaign with a managed bite . Once a company gets that balance right and finally reaches their full roll out target and stops spending then they try and figure out where the monster came from .. remember the roll out costs only keep the books down till they stop then it becomes a wall of money . Crescolabs is another monster in the making .. emotional day traders pushed both these stocks down .. thanks though I loaded crescolabs at 4.95 and I loaded wter at 1$ ..$$$. And I haven’t sold a dime of either .. I expect wter to get an offer for a buyout and if not .. look at monster energy .. . We will hit those highs . Last call was Moderna at 18$ .. I didn’t expect it to go so high so fast but I seen the same patterns in management. Management is everything…
"Ahoy gents and ladies, this stock made me richer than bill gates, I’m eating a golden grilled steak with bear sauce"
i dont trust mgt. after they [insiders] bought last yr. at $0.50 cents - i like the co. but its only existing to be sold ! im holding but am not expecting the $ 5 i had hoped for
WTER turns green as market turns green!
"This is a great marketing play for brand awareness and a lot of water is sod at airports. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that its 1-liter and 700ml bottles of Alkaline88 will be available in over 100 retail locations in nine major U.S. airports including JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Reagan National, Orlando International, George Bush Intercontinental/Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul International, and Philadelphia International. In what will be an immediate boon to the brand’s international awareness, hundreds of millions of passengers flying to over 250 destinations around the world will soon be able to enjoy Deliciously Smooth Alkaline88 on their journey."
"It looks to me like this has to move soon. Shaq and the management what I see are putting a lot of effort into promoting. Plus I keep thinking that with all the health concerns that people are waking up to the fact every detail helps, especially water from the right source."
Just remind the shorts up 96% for the year and that's without Shaq doing any marketing.Just wait till the marketing campaign begins. This stock will rip and be bought ought more then likely by either Coca-Cola or Pepsi.
Woo Hoo! I like WTER at these prices. I’m back in to see 2 dollar +.
Here we go baby!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/04/2307899/0/en/The-Alkaline-Water-Company-Inc-NASDAQ-WTER-CSE-WTER-Expands-into-High-Potential-Channels-Categories.html
It’s all so exciting
"This WTER must be Green today. After consolidating, back upwards we go."
@Jay. Have to give you a shoutout. 2 months ago you picked July 30th for date WTER would hot $2. Today it hit $2. Nice projection.

Large purchase made yesterday and today in early afternoon.
omg here we go again ... delay the QER!!! Why?Last time during the annual ER ... Not sure if they ever give a clear reason. TD reported 8/11 the 8/12 then 8/13 all because they receive info directly from someone (I assumed Alkaline88)What are they trying to hide?Does anyone able to calculate how many shares they have? How many shares Shaq still hold?
The 2nd quarter closes on 09/30. The results and c.c. will occur on or about 11/15.I'm predicting sales will be about 16+ million dollars. That's about a 50% increase YOY. I believe that qualifies as a growth stock.The most important items to watch for IMO are listed below:1 - the amount of cash on the balance sheet.2 - the increase in sales.3 - any comments on advertising plans.4 - comments on sales of individual sized servings of plain and flavored water.
Why rooting for Shaq when he is MIA? Also do read 8k to see why alkaline88 keep printing more shares to pay for Shaq causing the shareprice to decrease! Do we have anyone beside Larry reading the SEC filing?
"This is the traction from investors in the know. Majority of people haven’t even heard of A88, all about to change."
SHAQ needs to get in his truck and TAKE a BOAT load of WTER WATER CASES down to the FOLKS in Louisianan . Those Folks need help!
"WTER continues to do a great job of diluting our shares. Effective as of September 20, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,809,522 shares of our common stock upon exercise of our common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $1.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,761,902.50. We issued these shares to three non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) in an offshore transaction"
"Admittedly, I've been frustrated with this stock lately & disillusioned, but no now. Can't wait to try the new infused waters! I am bullish again!!"
it would be nice
How can you sell a bottle of water for $3.00 when a case of regular bottles of 24 goes for $4.99
"WTER got a little ahead of itself recently and was bound to pull back, but this is only the beginning of a huge move, and there is no way I'm selling anytime soon."
Hold! $2+ coming soon!
"Hopefully they're seeing a lot of interest this week (Thurs, Fri & Sat) at the trade show! Maybe some new distributers & store sign-ups. Fingers crossed! Hopefully they'll out a PR next week letting us know how it went. Happy weekend all!"
Shaq will start marketing soon wait for it.
we have consolidated above $2... next stop the moon!
New just gets better every day.
WTER is the essence of life
Deadensyde

Stay tuned."
Mute feature is great!
"$WTER is a gem, that’s why I’ve held tight. This was bound to pull back. Stocks never go straight up; I’ll see you at $3+."
Glad I’m in
Added a little in premarket. Pause and consolidation in SP was good and believe once the National Marketing Campaign is in full cycle it will bring a lot of attention to WTER and we will see another lift in SP. long game believe this company gets bought as their strategy looks focused only on increasing sales and market share for that to happen.
lol... sigh
8.54 percent tutes and growing
Looks like we are success at the trade show again this morning in Chicago. Huge large scale orders coming in
"In my previous comments or replies to other persons comments I addressed two items.1- the importance of the single serve drinks. It, IMO, is the most important part of their expansion plans. Many people are always on the move and want to have a drink when thirsty. Thus the companies desire for more expansion into convenience stores, gyms, airports, etc is currently being promulgated. This segment already represents 16% of total company sales. In the not too distant future it will be the largest portion of sales. Additionally it's more profitable for the company: higher margins.2 - this is for the speculation crowd. I mentioned PepsiCo as the possible acquirer of WTER in response to someone else' post. At that time I mentioned that Pepsi had sold off their generic branded water and wanted to expand further into premium branded water.Well since then it has come to my attention that Pepsi has the CURRENT contract to supply drinks to Papa Johns pizza. I don't know when it expires, however, I wonder if Mr O'Neal (Shaq) may convince management of Papa John's to change suppliers. It's entirely possible.Per the new ratings, just released, WTER overtook the PepsiCo water brand for the #8 position. I guarantee you PepsiCo management took notice of this.Just sayin'!!!!"
Go WTER! SHAQ is in the paint!
Short baggies Tam Ga and Larry fooled again. Up up 
Hold on tight!
"Found it in Wal-mart, Safeway and Rite Aid in the Napa Valley, CA!"
I’m so glad that I had unloaded this turkey at $2.25!!! The only way it broke over $1 was through a huge reverse split.
"Good evening stonkers, wen wil dis stok be 6$ dolarz?"
if there's a dude named Kevin on here trying to claim that alkaline water has made offerings or sold shares within this company do not pay him any attention. He has provided no proof of this whatsoever it is just him running his mouth m He is a paid short claiming that he sold three quarters of his stock and has 20% left over but yet ridicules the stock constantly. I would definitely block this dude He is no good.
Good to see new investors coming in here
Patience people. This could be $3.00 or more by summer 2022.
why doesn't the sams club news get more investor traction...this seems like a big deal to me.....
Silly early morning sellers.
"This seriously does not make since to me. 10% down in the past 4 days, before the earning call today? Someone please enlighten me. If sales are going well, why would they need money and have more shares outstanding as they only have 10 employees and outsource everything. The CEO is not making millions on the profit?"
Rev is up year after but earning is dropping to. Not good sign
OMG First it broke 1.68 then 1.55 then 1.50 now it broke 1.45... Where is Shaq? It is Oct too where is national marketing plan?
https://www.foxnews.com/sports/shaq-rejects-celebrity-status
one thing is for sure Kevin is a shortie and is going to be crying when this thing goes 10x when it gets bought up by Coke or Pepsi and the next year. Good luck shorties You're going to burn bad on this one Shaq never loses on any stock and he is heavily invested in this one.
"Seems all the hype with Shaq being involved with WTER is fading just a little. Saw where Shaq did another TV add with another company, nothing to do with water thank goodness. Hopefully very soon Shaq might be seen on TV holding a bottle of WTER which would certainly help move the stock. JMO GLTA"
"I agree we are going way up but…Shares of Alkaline Water slumped double-digits last week, following the company’s lukewarm June quarter earnings report. Revenue for the quarter rose 5% year-over-year, and the management team shared the balance sheet should be flush following the completion of the private placement deal that brought Shaquille O’Neal as the company’s brand ambassador. We would note the company discussed “an unexpected $1.3 million additional expenses from our supply chain and logistics related to the aftermath of COVID-19,” but there was no mention of this when Alkaline reported its March quarter’s results on July 6."
Higher highs and higher lows is awesome!  Love the huge volume lately too!
Water is my largest holding and I love that Shaq is on our team. I only hope he doesn't spread himself too thin and that we're able to have him on some online/tv commercials. I hope I'm doing my best to do my own promotional work by purchasing WTER products for my family and friends in an introductory manner and direct consumption in my home. I am also in the habit of asking any retailer I buy from who doesn't have our products on their shelf or menu for our products. These are small things but if repeated by hundreds of share holders it may have a material affect.
Good morning everyoneHope to hear from Shaq or see a national marketing campaign today
We need the big man shack on the TV promoting this company? Soon soon soon
"Interview with SHAQ here, https://taxunfiltered.com/2021/09/23/shaq-alkaline-water-wter/, shows sincere side of him."
"What does Ricky mean when he said (in news shown below by VADER) ""raw material manufacturers"". Is he talking about packaging stuff or the water and ingredients? Anybody know???"
Well this will now resume its march higher. Short baggies will be baling hard tomorrow. Expect 10% + pop and move to $3 over next few weeks.
WOW! A88 new infused water with the Vessl tech is awesome. The packaging is right on. Attaboy A88.
"Charts show the simple 50 day moving average is $1.80. The next resistance is $1.90, but then clear sailing to $2.15 resistance. GL WTERs!"

"Do you think Shaq is sitting in meetings with management every day ??? Bear in mind. that Shaq has a handful of college degrees, including an MBA from Arizona university."
This price of 1.65 is a bargain. Added 2000 shares this AM. This will quadruple by next year this time.

"I’m still not convinced. I saw their products in a store and not a single one was sold, my friend says, “yea you better not invest in that company.”"
Watched a whole trailer of Alkaline water get offloaded at a WMT distribution center. A lot of people buying WTER
Power hour 2pm - 3pm.
This company needs to distance themselves from CBD and just focus on the water. That CBD idea cost a lot in public image.
"uhhh, what just happened??"
So excited by good Q1 numbers they are having the call 45 days early
So at the NACS show yesterday in Chicago apparently alkaline 88 did such a great job that several investors put in large-scale orders that is why the stock shot up so quickly. today they are presenting again at the show so we could perhaps see another huge bump up which would create momentum that we need.
Strong volume continues with after hours. Something brewing!
"I received a message from above, too the moon!"
Don't listen to the fud about Shaq from shorts. This man is fully invested in this company literally. He will be the majority share holder.https://frontofficesports.com/shaq-alkaline-water-investment-portfolio/
Good ol Monday manipulation
Bloody day in the market...what can you do but buy and hold
Last chance to buy under $1.70?
Last chance to cover under $1.60?
"I continue to see very few bottles of alkaline 88 water on the shelves at the local Kroger every time I buy some. There used to be plenty, but this is becoming a very popular brand now. I bought 3 gallon sized bottles today, which left only a few remaining. Translation? I'm not selling."
just received my 88 water and wow. soooo refreshing I'm in for long haul.... hopefully it'll be another monster beverage type price
Shorties realizing not only that its not going back under $2 but also it's about to go green for the day.
Who remembered to adjust their Stop Limits yesterday? :-) Always take the profits :-)
"WTER still up 10% for the week, 30% for the month, and 98.5% for the year.... when in doubt zoom out.."
Nice day. More to come.
To allWe all can exchange info and express our thought but BJ cross the line and I hope you all stop him and push him away. We all have parents but not sure about him. Please help me educate Bobby Lee (*not sure if this is his real name)Thank you
"I’ve been waiting for the dilution bottom to hit $1.50’s Now is the time to pick up shares. I bought 100,000 today. $2.50-3.00 by EOY"
"From the PR today:""As we roll out Our First Ever traditional Marketing Campaign, we know that more customers will be looking for Alkaline88”I am loving what I'm seeing/reading, this is such a small cap in a multi billion market that's only growing as more and more people are awakening to a healthier lifestyle, less soda consumption etc... Then we have a CBD line, too, it is a no brainer to me the short and long term potential , my initial goal was 5$ but these are really re-adjusted depending on how strong we move so I am sitting comfortably on my shares here! GLTA"
just bought another 1100 shares ....
hey Kevin I don't know where you get your DD at but read the first sentence in this article Shaq has not been paid all his shares yet it will be 3 years of installmentsl... have a good dayhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/shaquille-o-neal-to-pitch-alkaline-water-brand-under-equity-pact
"Now THAT'S a great PR! I love the new vessl cap, makes me think of ""freshness"". I want to run out & buy the lemon-lime flavor now."
This pop must be based on the aluminum bottle news
"Short squeeze tomorrow? I’m not sure if there are many shorts, likely not I would think."
Will we see another spike post lunch? Maybe.

I feel good about this
thus dump wont break my confidence about this company

Woo Hoo!
"Based on all the warrants, etc exercised recently the company should have sufficient funds to operate for some time before having to raise any additional money.This company has operated on thin management ranks until recently. They have recently hired numerous people to fill out important positions for the exponential expansion that's expected.With the recently signed ABG-SHAQ agreement I suspect the sales expansion will be much better than expected.NOTE: I have recently had an opportunity to sample the product. IMO their water is very good. I have not tried any of the competitive companies products.However, I hate plain water. So, for me, to say I like their water is surprising. I never drink water without adding powder flavoring. As a matter of fact I purchased 5 gallon sized jugs: 2 from Wal-Mart and 3 from Food Lion."
"If yesterday was normal and profit-taking, then it should return to normal today. Look fine during pre-market, but not so fine during trading hours, not noon yet, still hope."
Won't hit $1.52 today. I know things.
SHAQ should get all the credit for today’s Sam’s Club addition. I bet he played a significant role. Thank you!
Good Morning A88!

"Vader, you drinking your WTER thru a sippy cup?"
wet days are ahead
Not seeing earnings scheduled for today on wter website calendar FYI
This is fantastic. My E*TRADE account has never been this big. Does water really have a chance of reaching four or five dollars?
just order a 24pk on the amazon website but was trying to see if they had the flavors they talk about on it but I didn’t see them . you need to try their product if you are investing on it
lol Notice shortie Kevin is no where to be found now 
I love it! I believe it! I’m not a shorty. SHAQ will bring more!
The wife just saw Alkaline 88 advertisement on Facebook.
I've been trying to tell y'all this for months about Shaq's effect on this stock and look what is happening off the first piece pf big news. Once Shaq starts really marketing we are going to the moon baby! 
The comeback is always greater than the setback
Prediction today possibly we close at 1.70-1.75 depending how it goes at the NCAS show. We can get all the great news in the world but if we're not getting buying pressure it doesn't matter . So fingers crossed..
"Doesn’t this say something that they will not be at Sky Harbor Airport, right in there backyard????"
Good day all
I scooped up some more shares. Love the sale today. I’m a long.
"I remember when Howard Stern signed with Sirius, I had 22000 shares at $0.72 p/s. It jumped to $9. I sold my shares a little too early (at $6.59). Still was a nice haul. Maybe when Basketball season starts up this fall, Shaq will give A88 a lot of exposure, and we'll get a nice spike."
They mentioned they were in Vegas filming a commercial with Shaq. It doesn't matter how many stores you get into if people don't recognize your name. Get on with releasing the commercials so people can REQUEST your product from their neighborhood stores if they don't have it. Commercials create interest & interest creates 'word of mouth' advertising...which is better & costs nothing.
