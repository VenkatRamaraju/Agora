"I’ve been waiting for the dilution bottom to hit $1.50’s Now is the time to pick up shares. I bought 100,000 today. $2.50-3.00 by EOY"

About time for the late afternoon tide to rise
Gaining market share.https://ir.thealkalinewaterco.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/382/the-alkaline-water-company-is-now-the-8th-largest-enhanced
Good day all
I could see the stock going to $19
"Don't want to go to the moon, just $3 per share, is this too much to ask. Can we send Shaq packing?"
Mute feature getting in shape.
just received my 88 water and wow. soooo refreshing I'm in for long haul.... hopefully it'll be another monster beverage type price
$2.00 incoming
"What does Ricky mean when he said (in news shown below by VADER) ""raw material manufacturers"". Is he talking about packaging stuff or the water and ingredients? Anybody know???"
"Charts show the simple 50 day moving average is $1.80. The next resistance is $1.90, but then clear sailing to $2.15 resistance. GL WTERs!"
Nothing like giving back all our gains from last week in one day.
I like WTER.
"More focus on marketing is a good thing. Shaq Paq is ok, but making the ""88"" name stand out and gain consumer recognition is key IMHO. Those familiar with Nascar know #88 has been used by several popular drivers over the years. Not being used currently in '21. I believe that WTER did some dirt track racing sponsorship in the past. I believe 88 is also a lucky number in China. Will be happy to see $2 crossed."
Hey fellow minions. We hit the $1.50’s Support again. Enjoy the ride to the $1.80’s by Friday then sell. ALWAYS TAKE THE PROFITS !!!!
Higher highs and higher lows is awesome!  Love the huge volume lately too!
"Well the profit taking did not break through $1.80. Like I shared, I love higher highs and higher lows. Back on up people. Woo Hoo."
Beat down by shorts all day and bounce back like a champion.... You want to know why???
For those of you screaming for Shaq...Here you go. The new Shaq Paq 2 litter's CBD infused water with his beautiful face on the cover. This is just the beginning.https://cspdailynews.com/beverages/alkaline88-maker-collaborates-shaq
"HAHAHA SHORTIEShttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline-water-company-records-another-201000266.htmlSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., August 16, 2021--The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the ""Company""), the country’s largest independent alkaline water co."
So at the NACS show yesterday in Chicago apparently alkaline 88 did such a great job that several investors put in large-scale orders that is why the stock shot up so quickly. today they are presenting again at the show so we could perhaps see another huge bump up which would create momentum that we need.
"I received a message from above, too the moon!"
"What concerns me... I live in aurora Indiana 50 miles west of cincinnati,oh. The krogers in lawrenceburg is out of the water more often than not. I like that their expanding but they have to keep their current customers stocked. Krogers wont hesitate to fill the shelves with their own products."
I love it! I believe it! I’m not a shorty. SHAQ will bring more!
WTER is the essence of life
"14,1 million in Revenue...up 19.6%"
Bullish. Finally
Added a little in premarket. Pause and consolidation in SP was good and believe once the National Marketing Campaign is in full cycle it will bring a lot of attention to WTER and we will see another lift in SP. long game believe this company gets bought as their strategy looks focused only on increasing sales and market share for that to happen.
WOW! A88 new infused water with the Vessl tech is awesome. The packaging is right on. Attaboy A88.
Thanks for more cheap shares.   
We need the big man shack on the TV promoting this company? Soon soon soon
"When was the last time you were able to view our company presentation? what kind of update that requires more than a week? Does anyone know our current # shares? 50 million, 75 million, 100 million?"
"Hopefully they're seeing a lot of interest this week (Thurs, Fri & Sat) at the trade show! Maybe some new distributers & store sign-ups. Fingers crossed! Hopefully they'll out a PR next week letting us know how it went. Happy weekend all!"
"Now THAT'S a great PR! I love the new vessl cap, makes me think of ""freshness"". I want to run out & buy the lemon-lime flavor now."

Well maybe buck 55 will be the low today.

Who remembered to adjust their Stop Limits yesterday? :-) Always take the profits :-)
Strong volume continues with after hours. Something brewing!
simple play the market dont try to move it no one here has that kind of money
"Well Premarket attention going on with 175,000 shares traded already!"
Nice again. Back to $2.00. 
There should be a shareholder vote coming soon.It's needed to approve another stock and warrant offering. The approval is required by 09/30/21 Vancouver Canada time.I've notified everyone on here before. However with all the excitement in the beautiful videos posted here I'm sure no one remembers.How does nonsense video help anyone understand this company ?
It’s all so exciting
They mentioned they were in Vegas filming a commercial with Shaq. It doesn't matter how many stores you get into if people don't recognize your name. Get on with releasing the commercials so people can REQUEST your product from their neighborhood stores if they don't have it. Commercials create interest & interest creates 'word of mouth' advertising...which is better & costs nothing.
"Ok, getting my feet wet here. Betting SHAQ will be doing national campaigns that got Sam’s Club on board."
"I don't think we'll see any positive movement until, (1) Commercials with Shaq are released and (2) the financials are released in November. People need to see the numbers, positive numbers. I thought we would move upwards with the other day's news, loved the new bottle cap with flavorings idea! It's just a waiting game right now. Glta"
"WTER still up 10% for the week, 30% for the month, and 98.5% for the year.... when in doubt zoom out.."
SHAQ PAQ 6 pack = a $6 stock
i dont trust mgt. after they [insiders] bought last yr. at $0.50 cents - i like the co. but its only existing to be sold ! im holding but am not expecting the $ 5 i had hoped for
Larry is a Buyer tomorrow. SP blows thru $2.50 on 50% +sales increase and outline of National Marketing plan coming soon this Fall.
Mighty fine day building new base.
Beautiful bounce back so far. Shaq starts marketing next month....Get ready and bucket up!
"A88 Premarket, I mean $1.88 Premarket. Woo Hoo"
Until Shaq starts showing his face on Television showing WTER in his hand and touting his words about this product I'm afraid WTER will remain at these price levels..I hope I'm wrong but we'll see..
Short baggies Tam Ga and Larry fooled again. Up up 
Incoming $2.00
"If yesterday was normal and profit-taking, then it should return to normal today. Look fine during pre-market, but not so fine during trading hours, not noon yet, still hope."
"Vader, you drinking your WTER thru a sippy cup?"
Good to see new investors coming in here
Expect a decent gain back in AH. I think the shorts have beat it down as far as it can go to. 175 seems to be strong resistance. I definitely expect a Green Day tomorrow
2.25 would be a very nice close
wth happened today? hope just a little profit taking pullback.
Go WTER! SHAQ is in the paint!
Don't listen to the fud about Shaq from shorts. This man is fully invested in this company literally. He will be the majority share holder.https://frontofficesports.com/shaq-alkaline-water-investment-portfolio/
"Based on all the warrants, etc exercised recently the company should have sufficient funds to operate for some time before having to raise any additional money.This company has operated on thin management ranks until recently. They have recently hired numerous people to fill out important positions for the exponential expansion that's expected.With the recently signed ABG-SHAQ agreement I suspect the sales expansion will be much better than expected.NOTE: I have recently had an opportunity to sample the product. IMO their water is very good. I have not tried any of the competitive companies products.However, I hate plain water. So, for me, to say I like their water is surprising. I never drink water without adding powder flavoring. As a matter of fact I purchased 5 gallon sized jugs: 2 from Wal-Mart and 3 from Food Lion."
"This is the traction from investors in the know. Majority of people haven’t even heard of A88, all about to change."
The biggest error most investors make with wter and others in this part of their growth is they place too much value in how much cash the company is making . They fail to recognize the value of an aggressive roll out campaign with a managed bite . Once a company gets that balance right and finally reaches their full roll out target and stops spending then they try and figure out where the monster came from .. remember the roll out costs only keep the books down till they stop then it becomes a wall of money . Crescolabs is another monster in the making .. emotional day traders pushed both these stocks down .. thanks though I loaded crescolabs at 4.95 and I loaded wter at 1$ ..$$$. And I haven’t sold a dime of either .. I expect wter to get an offer for a buyout and if not .. look at monster energy .. . We will hit those highs . Last call was Moderna at 18$ .. I didn’t expect it to go so high so fast but I seen the same patterns in management. Management is everything…
"Ahoy gents and ladies, this stock made me richer than bill gates, I’m eating a golden grilled steak with bear sauce"
This pop must be based on the aluminum bottle news
Bullish
How can you sell a bottle of water for $3.00 when a case of regular bottles of 24 goes for $4.99
one thing is for sure Kevin is a shortie and is going to be crying when this thing goes 10x when it gets bought up by Coke or Pepsi and the next year. Good luck shorties You're going to burn bad on this one Shaq never loses on any stock and he is heavily invested in this one.
Last chance to cover under $1.60?
if there's a dude named Kevin on here trying to claim that alkaline water has made offerings or sold shares within this company do not pay him any attention. He has provided no proof of this whatsoever it is just him running his mouth m He is a paid short claiming that he sold three quarters of his stock and has 20% left over but yet ridicules the stock constantly. I would definitely block this dude He is no good.
I’m so glad that I had unloaded this turkey at $2.25!!! The only way it broke over $1 was through a huge reverse split.
Won't hit $1.52 today. I know things.
"Interview with SHAQ here, https://taxunfiltered.com/2021/09/23/shaq-alkaline-water-wter/, shows sincere side of him."
Good day!
"Since July 28, it went as low as $1.72. So the summer is almost gone and we are at $1.66 (the lowest since 7/28/2021), where is Shaq? Where is the pop of the summer?"
Holiday Hydration gift box coming soon? Television? Radio? Social Media? I like the idea!
"@Tam GA...how can investors know how bad they are if they've never heard of them? The price can't go up until people know who they are. AND, how will investors know who they are???? BY getting the f'in commercials out!"

https://ir.thealkalinewaterco.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/381/the-alkaline-water-company-releases-six-new-a88cbd
This price of 1.65 is a bargain. Added 2000 shares this AM. This will quadruple by next year this time.
"It looks to me like this has to move soon. Shaq and the management what I see are putting a lot of effort into promoting. Plus I keep thinking that with all the health concerns that people are waking up to the fact every detail helps, especially water from the right source."
I’m under someone’s skin. Just can’t let me go. Funny though. GL.
Deadensyde
Last two days allowed me to get some of my position sold at $2.10 spike the other day. Thinking we would see some consolidation before next leg up. July sales results at coming earnings call and the National ad campaign details will be the boost that jumps the SP again.
we have consolidated above $2... next stop the moon!
"Like I said, $3+ coming SOON."
Hold! $2+ coming soon!

"WTER got a little ahead of itself recently and was bound to pull back, but this is only the beginning of a huge move, and there is no way I'm selling anytime soon."

WTER turns green as market turns green!
"$WTER is a gem, that’s why I’ve held tight. This was bound to pull back. Stocks never go straight up; I’ll see you at $3+."
"I agree we are going way up but…Shares of Alkaline Water slumped double-digits last week, following the company’s lukewarm June quarter earnings report. Revenue for the quarter rose 5% year-over-year, and the management team shared the balance sheet should be flush following the completion of the private placement deal that brought Shaquille O’Neal as the company’s brand ambassador. We would note the company discussed “an unexpected $1.3 million additional expenses from our supply chain and logistics related to the aftermath of COVID-19,” but there was no mention of this when Alkaline reported its March quarter’s results on July 6."
looking like 2.50 by Friday for sure.
"Found it in Wal-mart, Safeway and Rite Aid in the Napa Valley, CA!"
"Wter is down almost 7% today. Why, what has changed in the company from say, last week? Nothing. Am I missing something?"
I still feel good about this.
I wonder what shorty decided to short WTER around $1? Any guesses?
SLAM Dunk!! Oh sorry that’s Shaw’s line. Will go with it’s pouring WTER on all the short baggies.
This is completely normal always before earnings trying to shake off the paper items like Nate.

"Seems all the hype with Shaq being involved with WTER is fading just a little. Saw where Shaq did another TV add with another company, nothing to do with water thank goodness. Hopefully very soon Shaq might be seen on TV holding a bottle of WTER which would certainly help move the stock. JMO GLTA"
Silly early morning sellers.
"In my previous comments or replies to other persons comments I addressed two items.1- the importance of the single serve drinks. It, IMO, is the most important part of their expansion plans. Many people are always on the move and want to have a drink when thirsty. Thus the companies desire for more expansion into convenience stores, gyms, airports, etc is currently being promulgated. This segment already represents 16% of total company sales. In the not too distant future it will be the largest portion of sales. Additionally it's more profitable for the company: higher margins.2 - this is for the speculation crowd. I mentioned PepsiCo as the possible acquirer of WTER in response to someone else' post. At that time I mentioned that Pepsi had sold off their generic branded water and wanted to expand further into premium branded water.Well since then it has come to my attention that Pepsi has the CURRENT contract to supply drinks to Papa Johns pizza. I don't know when it expires, however, I wonder if Mr O'Neal (Shaq) may convince management of Papa John's to change suppliers. It's entirely possible.Per the new ratings, just released, WTER overtook the PepsiCo water brand for the #8 position. I guarantee you PepsiCo management took notice of this.Just sayin'!!!!"

"Another dilution of shareholder value. 83,000 shares. Looks to be some type of equity bonus granted prior. Not sure why a company that has not yet learned to make money is giving out bonuses.

"Just released,SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline water company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that this year’s sales in the all-important C-Store channel have more than doubled over the previous year. The Company attributes much of this growth to partnerships with several new major Direct-Store-Delivery providers and additional placements in six new distribution centers of legacy partners.“Our C-store channel sales are beginning to grow significantly. Last month alone, we grew by almost 300% in c-store sales, making it by far our most successful month in the company’s history. This is before the full impact of any of our new DSDs or six new distribution centers has even been felt,” said Richard A. Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “The Alkaline88 footprint continues to expand with each new distribution center added to our nationwide network. Recent additions to our network of distributors include Nassau Candy, Cooper Booth Wholesale, Hensley Beverage Company, Nevada Beverage Company, and National Convenience Distributors. Combined with our legacy partners, our network’s access now gives us the potential to service approximately 50,000 of the 150,000 convenience stores across the country. Between our traditional channels and C-stores, our single-serves are now available to more customers than ever before. Many of our single-serve SKUs, including our aluminum bottle and many of our flavored-infused waters, are on pace to significantly outperform their sales from last year. The C-store channel is a leader in bottled water sales with over $4.5 billion in sales last year, according to Convenience Store News. While we continue to see significant growth in our traditional channels, we anticipate that the convenience channel will meaningfully contribute to our fiscal year 2022 sales revenues.”"

How many shares Shaq still hold?

"Go Go Go , I want this company in The News !!!"
"Happy with the report. Will be watching for further expansion in the price-club, CBD and single serve segments."
SHAQ should get all the credit for today’s Sam’s Club addition. I bet he played a significant role. Thank you!

thus dump wont break my confidence about this company
"Started drinking this a year ago , had no Idea it would help with gout flare up. I'm a fan and purchased my 1st 15 shares today."
Shaq will start marketing soon wait for it.
This is fantastic. My E*TRADE account has never been this big. Does water really have a chance of reaching four or five dollars?
Power hour 2pm - 3pm.
Love new highs and new high lows. Signs of good movement.
Prediction today possibly we close at 1.70-1.75 depending how it goes at the NCAS show. We can get all the great news in the world but if we're not getting buying pressure it doesn't matter . So fingers crossed..
Bloody day in the market...what can you do but buy and hold
lol... sigh
Interesting news I did not know: nestle acquired essestia alkaline water co back in March when their sales hit around $190m
"Did not expect it get to 1.98 by the end this week and it got close just 2 cents short, closed at 1.96, most men or women must love that combination 96.1.96 is beautiful!Congrats @LiquidVrCash!"
Just would like to take this opportunity to thank the shorties for giving me a chance to load up again. Now it's going to be fun to watch you guys get crushed.
Shaq sold
Just remind the shorts up 96% for the year and that's without Shaq doing any marketing.Just wait till the marketing campaign begins. This stock will rip and be bought ought more then likely by either Coca-Cola or Pepsi.
Yahoo posting 4 days to earnings call now. However nothing on WTER investor relations site IR calendar.
OMG First it broke 1.68 then 1.55 then 1.50 now it broke 1.45... Where is Shaq? It is Oct too where is national marketing plan?
I bought a gallon on A88 at a Rite aid in Michigan. Only a few left on the shelf
Woo Hoo!
The 2nd quarter closes on 09/30. The results and c.c. will occur on or about 11/15.I'm predicting sales will be about 16+ million dollars. That's about a 50% increase YOY. I believe that qualifies as a growth stock.The most important items to watch for IMO are listed below:1 - the amount of cash on the balance sheet.2 - the increase in sales.3 - any comments on advertising plans.4 - comments on sales of individual sized servings of plain and flavored water.
Why rooting for Shaq when he is MIA? Also do read 8k to see why alkaline88 keep printing more shares to pay for Shaq causing the shareprice to decrease! Do we have anyone beside Larry reading the SEC filing?
I scooped up some more shares. Love the sale today. I’m a long.
Amazing the amount of effort shorts put into making the stock go down before close.
You guys know I've been here for awhile (I was Space OG also) and I have to admit I am thoroughly confused on what is going on lately with this stock. there seems to be nothing but great news everyday and today was one of the biggest days for news but yet no momentum whatsoever. so my only conclusion is the stock is being heavy manipulated right now. I'm going to hold like I've been doing for the past couple years but if it dips back under a dollar I'm going to strongly consider getting out I have to admit it finally. Yes it's a red day in the market and I know I'm the one that usually preaches that but there's a lot of stocks that have momentum and are going green today alkaline 88 should be one of those. Don't get me wrong I'm still in love with this stock but red flags signaling manipulation by Hedge Funds are going up now.
just bought another 1100 shares ....
My guess is Tam GA and Larry have short calls around the 1.60 mark and are losing very bad 
I'm all in when it hits .90
"Short squeeze tomorrow? I’m not sure if there are many shorts, likely not I would think."
Looks like we are success at the trade show again this morning in Chicago. Huge large scale orders coming in
Let’s be honest. This thing is going to get bought…..soon. I’m all in and hodling.
All good 
Looks like a $1.80 kind of day!
Good Morning A88!
"Their quarterly results will be released soon.They will lose many millions of dollars for the foreseeable future.Don't believe me. Look at the 10K.Anyone on this board can ask management on the conference call.Many of our newfound ""investors"" (that makes me laugh) are going to be very disappointed."
Woo Hoo! I like WTER at these prices. I’m back in to see 2 dollar +.
Well this will now resume its march higher. Short baggies will be baling hard tomorrow. Expect 10% + pop and move to $3 over next few weeks.
"Sam’s Club today, Wal Mart store shelves tomorrow, and then the World!"
Larry is buying premarket.
Glad I’m in
"Anything Shaq touches seems to workout for share holders, look at Poppa Johns Pizza for example..JMO..GLTA"
will someone buy them out or no?
always has been resistance at 1.68... we break that it's on 2.00 easy
checkout $hiru
Manipulation is strong right now. Don't let the shorts scare you. HOLD! at

just bought another 700 shares on this dip. I have not seen these prices in quite a while.

HOLD ! 
This company needs to distance themselves from CBD and just focus on the water. That CBD idea cost a lot in public image.
"I’m still not convinced. I saw their products in a store and not a single one was sold, my friend says, “yea you better not invest in that company.”"
What are we looking at as far as a stock price goes if it gets bought out or acquired?
hey Kevin I don't know where you get your DD at but read the first sentence in this article Shaq has not been paid all his shares yet it will be 3 years of installmentsl... have a good dayhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/shaquille-o-neal-to-pitch-alkaline-water-brand-under-equity-pact

Water is my largest holding and I love that Shaq is on our team. I only hope he doesn't spread himself too thin and that we're able to have him on some online/tv commercials. I hope I'm doing my best to do my own promotional work by purchasing WTER products for my family and friends in an introductory manner and direct consumption in my home. I am also in the habit of asking any retailer I buy from who doesn't have our products on their shelf or menu for our products. These are small things but if repeated by hundreds of share holders it may have a material affect.
"Admittedly, I've been frustrated with this stock lately & disillusioned, but no now. Can't wait to try the new infused waters! I am bullish again!!"
