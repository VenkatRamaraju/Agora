Second quarter 2021 sees 33.7% year over year sales growth. Give us all a Woo Hoo!
"Sorry but this company has no chance. Losing market share every month to CORE, Essentia, Smartwater and Body Armor Sport Water"
Last two days allowed me to get some of my position sold at $2.10 spike the other day. Thinking we would see some consolidation before next leg up. July sales results at coming earnings call and the National ad campaign details will be the boost that jumps the SP again.
Yahoo posting 4 days to earnings call now. However nothing on WTER investor relations site IR calendar.
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline-water-company-enters-era-131500184.htmlSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., September 16, 2021--The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ: WTER) (CSE: WTER) (the ""Company""), the country’s largest independent alkaline w..."
Good days are back! Sprouts has been out of the 23.7 oz bottle for over 2 weeks. (out at warehouse).I found it today at Engle's supermarket. Weeeee ooooo. 10/$10
Larry ‘L’ 4 minutes ago. I’m posting it as he says he deletes his posts. I’m afraid he’s drinking and posting. Here it is “I'm going to enjoy watching who the bagholders will be.As some of you may remember I said hopefully this stock price hits $3. Don't bother looking for it. I delete my #$%$ts regularly.There's one real #$%$ that I'm waiting to see what my girl karma does to them.I normally don't take joy in anyone losing money. Lets see what happens.I'm not into repeating myself. Most won't understand this comment.Can't expect much from people with no attention retention.”
Biggest pump and dump in history. Got a newspaper in the mail today fully devoted to this company. The newspaper concerns every warning sign of a pump and dump that has ever been mentioned. Would never ever buy a stock that is being pumped this way. Good luck to those that do.
"$WTER is a gem, that’s why I’ve held tight. This was bound to pull back. Stocks never go straight up; I’ll see you at $3+."
What a great day! Buy happy they say.
"Like I said, $3+ coming SOON."
Just remind the shorts up 96% for the year and that's without Shaq doing any marketing.Just wait till the marketing campaign begins. This stock will rip and be bought ought more then likely by either Coca-Cola or Pepsi.
I little DD. Check out the 3 month chart. This profit taking is normal on our trend upward.
Larry is a Buyer tomorrow. SP blows thru $2.50 on 50% +sales increase and outline of National Marketing plan coming soon this Fall.
Major cash burning
I’m out at 1.93. Please please let me back in.
Sell the pop! After earnings! $1.00
"I remain positive. Actually pleasantly surprised SP has held up as well as it has over last two weeks. I know others have mentioned some of this, but overdue earnings and guidance is concerning. The SHAQ announcement was good, but he does not have any of his money in the game that we know. Sure hope all the hoopla on sales is truthful. Last earnings release was 2/16. Why so late? Something in the works - keeping SP low to accumulate before a major announcement-sale. This would be the best outcome or reason for late reporting. We all have seen the negative reasons- staying in, but concerned."
Watched a whole trailer of Alkaline water get offloaded at a WMT distribution center. A lot of people buying WTER
Woo Hoo! Say it now in case I sleep in past 7:30am.
"Good morning thirsty sac scrubbers, I’m at the beach right now and I need some money to feed my kid, should I buy more of this fine stonk?"

omg here we go again ... delay the QER!!! Why?Last time during the annual ER ... Not sure if they ever give a clear reason. TD reported 8/11 the 8/12 then 8/13 all because they receive info directly from someone (I assumed Alkaline88)What are they trying to hide?Does anyone able to calculate how many shares they have? How many shares Shaq still hold?
A couple of things we all know.1) mute Tam GA 2) tomorrow is a big day. We either tread water a while longer or we go to the Moon. Hopefully we go to the Moon as all indications are that they added a lot of new distributors during 1st half of year- should materialize in good sales increase.
The wife just saw Alkaline 88 advertisement on Facebook.
"Likely why all the volatility, yesterday. This guy must not know that they have hired Shaq. https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/07/21870693/canaccord-genuity-downgrades-alkaline-water-co-to-sell-lowers-price-target-to-0-9"
Wter was just added to the CSE composite 25 index.
The full report from Benzinga is just paid advertising! It does nothing for this stock!
Another YTD high for $WTER.$WTER: The Best is Yet to Come.
Incoming $2.00
I like WTER. It’s an investment.
"WTER,, I have a good faith in this stock coz nobody can stop drinking water.. as simple as that :) I have been tracing this stock since February even tomorrow if am not pleased with the result I think i should keep it for a while am sure am gonna make good money out of it :P"
"More focus on marketing is a good thing. Shaq Paq is ok, but making the ""88"" name stand out and gain consumer recognition is key IMHO. Those familiar with Nascar know #88 has been used by several popular drivers over the years. Not being used currently in '21. I believe that WTER did some dirt track racing sponsorship in the past. I believe 88 is also a lucky number in China. Will be happy to see $2 crossed."
"the fact that this is holding on worries me, more to come for the group"
"Last chance to buy WTER at $1.50 will be this week. Last time I made this kind of prediction was last month when I stated it was the last time you will be able to buy WTER for $1.25; I was spot on. It's a very good sign when a stock climbs over 50% like WTER has in less than two months before the Conference Call.After Friday, Smart Money sentiment will skyrocket and next week institutional ownership will be higher than insider ownership for the first time in WTER's history. With this being said, WTER is about to get noticed on Friday by some big time players.If WTER was trading at the equivalent of their peers it should be valued at $5.15 per share."
simple play the market dont try to move it no one here has that kind of money
Shaq will start marketing soon wait for it.
The biggest error most investors make with wter and others in this part of their growth is they place too much value in how much cash the company is making . They fail to recognize the value of an aggressive roll out campaign with a managed bite . Once a company gets that balance right and finally reaches their full roll out target and stops spending then they try and figure out where the monster came from .. remember the roll out costs only keep the books down till they stop then it becomes a wall of money . Crescolabs is another monster in the making .. emotional day traders pushed both these stocks down .. thanks though I loaded crescolabs at 4.95 and I loaded wter at 1$ ..$$$. And I haven’t sold a dime of either .. I expect wter to get an offer for a buyout and if not .. look at monster energy .. . We will hit those highs . Last call was Moderna at 18$ .. I didn’t expect it to go so high so fast but I seen the same patterns in management. Management is everything…
WTER needs to get the price down in the supermarkets4 times the price of other Alkaline products on the shelf.A lot of competition.Go shopping Buy 3 alkaline productsLet’s share the comparisons.Alkaline88 stated their ultimate goal was to sell the company. Am here for that day!
Anyone in at these levels are going to be so happy to apart of a game changing story
"Found A88 @ Ralph's in Pacific Palisades, CA ... only one big jug was left!"
They mentioned they were in Vegas filming a commercial with Shaq. It doesn't matter how many stores you get into if people don't recognize your name. Get on with releasing the commercials so people can REQUEST your product from their neighborhood stores if they don't have it. Commercials create interest & interest creates 'word of mouth' advertising...which is better & costs nothing.
thus dump wont break my confidence about this company
what makes this rough he bought a 1500000 for $1.05 with an add on of that much he can sell at $1.25 in three years. and a form just downgraded it to a 90 cent buy.
Did you know? The Vanguard Group Inc. is WTER’s top institutional holder with 2.2 million shares.
Why would a company who sells water ever make money?
"The last time the market dropped this much in one day, WTER was up for the day. Today, another horrible day for the markets, yet WTER doesn't lose a cent. A sure sign of strength.WTER will rise to the Dec. 10th, 2018 price. This special day in WTER's history was the day WTER debuted on Nasdaq at a price of $5.15. Today, WTER is much stronger in every way, shape and form, yet you can buy WTER for $1.75. WTER is going to $5.15 in the next twelve to 14 months."
"I first bought this before it was on the naz , under a dollar , bought a few months ago and just sold again at the high, will wait till it drops again and I will buy again and it will drop again been here for a long time , so all you pumpers and dumpers have fun bashing each other LOL"

"Don’t fret, SHAQ was drinking too much water and caused outs at stores. Soon to be resupplied and the drinking begins again. WTER at $3 by Labor Day."
Getting towards late July. Not looking like this will get the Summer effect hoped for and bump to $2+. IMO last earnings release stifled the SP rise and placed us into a tighter trading range. Need some further good news before Fall national marketing campaign to get this going.
Expect a decent gain back in AH. I think the shorts have beat it down as far as it can go to. 175 seems to be strong resistance. I definitely expect a Green Day tomorrow
"This is a great marketing play for brand awareness and a lot of water is sod at airports. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that its 1-liter and 700ml bottles of Alkaline88 will be available in over 100 retail locations in nine major U.S. airports including JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Reagan National, Orlando International, George Bush Intercontinental/Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul International, and Philadelphia International. In what will be an immediate boon to the brand’s international awareness, hundreds of millions of passengers flying to over 250 destinations around the world will soon be able to enjoy Deliciously Smooth Alkaline88 on their journey."
"I agree we are going way up but…Shares of Alkaline Water slumped double-digits last week, following the company’s lukewarm June quarter earnings report. Revenue for the quarter rose 5% year-over-year, and the management team shared the balance sheet should be flush following the completion of the private placement deal that brought Shaquille O’Neal as the company’s brand ambassador. We would note the company discussed “an unexpected $1.3 million additional expenses from our supply chain and logistics related to the aftermath of COVID-19,” but there was no mention of this when Alkaline reported its March quarter’s results on July 6."
I still feel good about this.
Tam Ga drinking lots of water with vodka to drown his sorrows.
just order a 24pk on the amazon website but was trying to see if they had the flavors they talk about on it but I didn’t see them . you need to try their product if you are investing on it
There is no beef in this stock. Very disheartening
Had a feeling might be a red day after the huge run-up early. Still in great shape don't sell.
"Good dog, I mean WTER!"
What happened to Liquid?

Buy low now and sell high later (plagiarized). Our bag  holder should hold and average down.
I’m so glad that I had unloaded this turkey at $2.25!!! The only way it broke over $1 was through a huge reverse split.
Be Water!“INKW”
WTER reported Record Revenue of $46 million for fiscal year 2021. Very Impressive is an understatement.
$1.50 Next!Do ur dd on INKW!Artesian Water from the basin of the Appalachian mountains!Trillions of gallons!Not purified water! Like this one!￼
by not announcing details on what caused the cancelation and no new date you have left stock holders holding the bag....shame on them.
"Yeah, okay. Sales up/stock down. What happened to $2￼.25?"
For those of you screaming for Shaq...Here you go. The new Shaq Paq 2 litter's CBD infused water with his beautiful face on the cover. This is just the beginning.https://cspdailynews.com/beverages/alkaline88-maker-collaborates-shaq
This price of 1.65 is a bargain. Added 2000 shares this AM. This will quadruple by next year this time.
I like WTER. I like SHAQ as WTER ambassador and advisor.
We need the big man shack on the TV promoting this company? Soon soon soon

What is brewing is the paid endorsement of Shaquille O'Neal and and Investor Journal Newspaper sent to Suckers to Buy this stock.
"Don't want to go to the moon, just $3 per share, is this too much to ask. Can we send Shaq packing?"
"When was the last time you were able to view our company presentation? what kind of update that requires more than a week? Does anyone know our current # shares? 50 million, 75 million, 100 million?"
"On December 10, 2018, WTER was listed on Nasdaq at a price of $5.15. If WTER can increase by just .25 every month, it will take 14 months to reach $5.15 from today's closing price. I feel we could reach $5.15 in less time. Perhaps in 12 months. Once we reach $5.15, we will no longer be a micro cap stock, we will be considered a small cap stock. At that time, expect the bidding wars to begin for WTER.Functional Water is the fastest growing space in the beverage industry and WTER is the leader in this category. A nice place to be.$WTER: The Best is Yet to Come!"
Got a p&d email this morning.look out below!
"Another 1,520,213 warrants have been exercised for $1.25."
Let’s be honest. This thing is going to get bought…..soon. I’m all in and hodling.
Short baggies Tam Ga and Larry fooled again. Up up 
Is SHAQ drinking WTER today? That man can drink a lot of water.
well shorties are definitely here so that's good news for the stock
"Shaquille Quote, ""I only invest in companies I believe in and products that I use. Alkaline88 checks both boxes. We've got big plans for this company and I'm looking forward to being a key player in its continued success."""
Added a little in premarket. Pause and consolidation in SP was good and believe once the National Marketing Campaign is in full cycle it will bring a lot of attention to WTER and we will see another lift in SP. long game believe this company gets bought as their strategy looks focused only on increasing sales and market share for that to happen.
"The Shaq Pack- brilliant. The National Marketing campaign starts. Here we go!!! Company bought out in a year - 5 bagger. Shaquille O‘Neal has partnered with The Alkaline Water Company for its first-ever comprehensive, omnichannel marketing campaign."
Really good sign all these new shorts are showing up and care about everybody's money so much... They are sht scared and it's hilarious 
"Their quarterly results will be released soon.They will lose many millions of dollars for the foreseeable future.Don't believe me. Look at the 10K.Anyone on this board can ask management on the conference call.Many of our newfound ""investors"" (that makes me laugh) are going to be very disappointed."
Mute feature is in high use ever since this broke $1.50. Now we get short squeeze too!
Closes green. Nice and a day like today! 
"Found it in Wal-mart, Safeway and Rite Aid in the Napa Valley, CA!"
I scooped up some more shares. Love the sale today. I’m a long.
Holding all my shares. Happy 4th of July!
need to break through that 2$.. keeps stalling there
Power hour 2pm - 3pm.

Woo Hoo!
I missed the run today. Another one this week and it will hold.
hey Kevin I don't know where you get your DD at but read the first sentence in this article Shaq has not been paid all his shares yet it will be 3 years of installmentsl... have a good dayhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/shaquille-o-neal-to-pitch-alkaline-water-brand-under-equity-pact
If the NBA finals makes it to game 7 n there's no $wter commercial with Shaq in it pregame or during the game they missed a huge opportunity js
The news I saw for the 7th was some Canadian hedgies want .90 cents a share so they downgraded $WTER.

wth happened today? hope just a little profit taking pullback.
"The ceo in this company is hungry , intelligent and smooth . He is playing aggressively for market share to make himself a buyout . All his energy is being spent like a player on a fresh monopoly board .. move , buyout what you land on then move and do it again . In 2 years they covered the u s and are now moving out to Mexico and targeting Canada . I like it . When they take a breath they will be in every corner of the earth if Pepsi or coke don’t buy them out …. Coming to a store near you !!"
"Home from DC, stopped at local Newport News Kroger, noted over 25 different brands of water. NO WTER products. Tough market to stand out in? Has anyone seen an WTER advertisement?"

Going up way too high
I bought a gallon on A88 at a Rite aid in Michigan. Only a few left on the shelf
Beat down by shorts all day and bounce back like a champion.... You want to know why???
"I’m still not convinced. I saw their products in a store and not a single one was sold, my friend says, “yea you better not invest in that company.”"
"Shorts  shorts  and more shorts  lol don’t fret a short, just squeeze them."
Here we go
bought in shop rite today in nj
"Go Go Go , I want this company in The News !!!"
"Found A88 in Austin, NV"
just bought another 1100 shares ....
"This seriously does not make since to me. 10% down in the past 4 days, before the earning call today? Someone please enlighten me. If sales are going well, why would they need money and have more shares outstanding as they only have 10 employees and outsource everything. The CEO is not making millions on the profit?"
Just the beginning people!
nice consolidation. I expect a big week next week.
This has been a nice 4 days. How about $1.88 on Friday!
"A little good morning wish, break a $1.88 today!"
The comeback is always greater than the setback
Bloody day in the market...what can you do but buy and hold
"Solid company, been on my watch list. I’m in $$ GL"
Look what the name Shaq did for Pappa Johns Pizza. Everything he touches seems to be turning to gold. WTER could be the next big winner..JMO..
"Started drinking this a year ago , had no Idea it would help with gout flare up. I'm a fan and purchased my 1st 15 shares today."
"Call your attention to a post way back start of June. Jay replied July 30th to hit $2. Toast with WTER to him, as he was closest and maybe spot on the way it looks!!!Ok let?s have some fun. Call your date this hits $2. I will go with July 9th. One further, call $2.50 by August 1st.Posted the above 18 days ago. Right now the only one clearly out in this one was Moe who was calling for $1. Shaq dunked his #$%$ Let?s see what happens."
one thing is for sure Kevin is a shortie and is going to be crying when this thing goes 10x when it gets bought up by Coke or Pepsi and the next year. Good luck shorties You're going to burn bad on this one Shaq never loses on any stock and he is heavily invested in this one.

Heat wave after heat wave. There will be record amount of WTER drinking. Raising my sell limit for 1/2 of shares to $2.50
just bought another 700 shares on this dip. I have not seen these prices in quite a while.
My guess is Tam GA and Larry have short calls around the 1.60 mark and are losing very bad

"Another down day in the markets another YTD high for WTER. Everytime the markets have a bad day, WTER goes up. An absolute sure sign of strength."
"I have to order it on Amazon, stores here can't keep it in stock."
So has anyone listened to this CEO in the past? What did you think of the past few calls from this CEO?
we have consolidated above $2... next stop the moon!
Good morning WTER!
"So funny people are justifying it going to the moon by telling about their water findings in random shops across the country  I’m in it to win it and wants it to hit the moon, start a population and evolve in to other species "
Back to $2
"I think Larry is like a spoiled little boy. Jealous of all the longs Too bad Larry the doubter you do not believe or maybe your one of our short baggies that filling our wallets. Anyhow, thank you teller."
"WTER still up 10% for the week, 30% for the month, and 98.5% for the year.... when in doubt zoom out.."
WTER is a strong buy. Great growth stock.https://youtu.be/yqEPRTXxHi0
"SHAQ consuming 1,000 ounces of WTER daily per his contract. New contracts in Middle East to use for Camels to improve their health and speed said to be a bonanza. WTER doing everything to lift sales to entice buyout."
"Since July 28, it went as low as $1.72. So the summer is almost gone and we are at $1.66 (the lowest since 7/28/2021), where is Shaq? Where is the pop of the summer?"
So grateful Shaq is on the WTER team. WTER is no longer going to be under the radar. Institutions as well as NBA players with deep pockets will start taking notice now that Shaq has invested his own money; this speaks volumes about his belief in the company. Shaq brings credibility. WTER: The Best is Yet to Come.

"The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the ""Company""), today announced that it is postponing its full year fiscal 2021 earnings results call as the 10-K has not been filed. Regulation FD prevents the Company from holding the call at this time.This is unheard of. As an investor this seriously undermines my confidence in this Companies leadership. Not certain what I will do from this news as there is no rational explanation. In my opinion if there was a good news explanation, this would not be the excuse for postponement."
New marketing guy could throw us a bone. Just saying
Well this will now resume its march higher. Short baggies will be baling hard tomorrow. Expect 10% + pop and move to $3 over next few weeks.

@Larry a man who tries to act like he cares about other people's money is the real snake and serpent Larry. if you don't like the stock just go away man. we know why you're here we're not stupid You're a short and you're trying to talk us out of something that's going to be huge in the next few years that is your only purpose for being here. and it just makes me want to buy more.
Good day all
"I continue to see very few bottles of alkaline 88 water on the shelves at the local Kroger every time I buy some. There used to be plenty, but this is becoming a very popular brand now. I bought 3 gallon sized bottles today, which left only a few remaining. Translation? I'm not selling."
"A88 Premarket, I mean $1.88 Premarket. Woo Hoo"
Mute feature getting in shape.
just received my 88 water and wow. soooo refreshing I'm in for long haul.... hopefully it'll be another monster beverage type price
This pop must be based on the aluminum bottle news
"omg ... we forgot to say sorry and give a clear reason for postponement, the market punishes us 10%. Or maybe something to do with Shaq deal!!?"
"On June 30, 2021 WTER filedhttps://ir.thealkalinewaterco.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001062993-21-006117/0001062993-21-006117.pdfKnowing legally not allow to call CC on July 2nd but still release the press release, then force to postpone on the same day - July 2nd.While looking at SEC filing, I could not find any filing that Shaq purchased 7,000,000 shares ... could it be fake news?"
Hold on tight!
Shaq to start global marketing soon.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210720005170/en/
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/28b76275-4a8f-3722-8ddc-8f0f73aad465/an-interview-with-shaquille.html?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
"Happy with the report. Will be watching for further expansion in the price-club, CBD and single serve segments."
lol how's the dump taste? Stock pumps 10% only to dump to...what?....-3% by end of day? Seems legit.
Don't listen to the fud about Shaq from shorts. This man is fully invested in this company literally. He will be the majority share holder.https://frontofficesports.com/shaq-alkaline-water-investment-portfolio/
"Ok let’s have some fun. After July 2nd postponement mess, here we are in this coming Tuesday with another cc. Hope no more accident from here on out until cc time. Do you believe investors regain confidence with WTER? Will it move sp on Tuesday after cc? Call your date this hits $2."
"LC believes it would be $1.88 this week. And Larry just hope to get even with $1.80, others are just clueless, what do you think?"
Can’t stop Shaquille O’Neal 
"Today, WTER closed at a YTD high."
$WTER 2.00 soonlets go!
will someone buy them out or no?
5$ end of day right lol
This is a miserably performing stock that consistently sheds gains
More customers across nation announced.
"Another dilution of shareholder value. 83,000 shares. Looks to be some type of equity bonus granted prior. Not sure why a company that has not yet learned to make money is giving out bonuses. For me I made a decision to stay in until the effect of the National Marketing is realized. Better be good."
Green!
"14,1 million in Revenue...up 19.6%"
Dilution and unfortunately we tread water from here for a while. Does not appear we get the usual Sumner pop now. Will need big news to move it back up. Still a long term play. Really need to see gain in market share in markets they have been in. Have not seen any stats on this.
There should be a shareholder vote coming soon.It's needed to approve another stock and warrant offering. The approval is required by 09/30/21 Vancouver Canada time.I've notified everyone on here before. However with all the excitement in the beautiful videos posted here I'm sure no one remembers.How does nonsense video help anyone understand this company ?
CC delay. Stock should drop at opening before rebounding at end of day. Reason is 10k not filed.
"Wasn’t it just 2 days ago that they announced the CC for today? Either there has been a major subsequent event, or a dispute with outside CPA’s over accounting policies."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline-water-company-host-conference-131500371.html
Lol if they can keep up the pressure there will be a few shorts covering from Canada tomorrow . Trade is down for holidays
Be Water and now Happy Mellow coming from Green Concepts! Artesian sweet well water! From N Carolina!(INKW)￼
"Did not expect it get to 1.98 by the end this week and it got close just 2 cents short, closed at 1.96, most men or women must love that combination 96.1.96 is beautiful!Congrats @LiquidVrCash!"
Good day!
I still sold too early. TF is this though? So 1.70s for decent entry?
Looks like Canaccord Genuity analyst Luke Hannan issued some poor guidance the other day. A few investors will not be listening to his advice any time soon.
"Finally found a 1/2 gallon to try in Georgetown, DC, CVS. Its water."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline88-growth-accelerates-first-quarter-131500253.html
I like WTER!
"So much hopes, so much dreams but could not hang in there, just 2 days above 1.75, highest accomplishment in 2021. Try again next week"
I've been trying to tell y'all this for months about Shaq's effect on this stock and look what is happening off the first piece pf big news. Once Shaq starts really marketing we are going to the moon baby! 
Glad I’m in
$2.00 incoming
This is fantastic. My E*TRADE account has never been this big. Does water really have a chance of reaching four or five dollars?
"Mark, why short WTER? With history of growth YOY, you’ll lose."
"WALMART whse full of pallets of Alkaline 88, but not moving very fast. Start your National Marketing campaign there. Pallets had layer of dust-not a good sign. I have become neutral on this play, if someone would come in and buy for $3 a share it would be a blessing. Getting a bad vibe here. Need to see positive comps in markets they have been in. That is true market share growth- not growth from entering new markets."
8.54 percent tutes and growing
About time for the late afternoon tide to rise
I'm all in when it hits .90
"Fiscal 3rd quarter 2021, which is October November December, is anticipated start of national marketing campaign. Holding!"
Water is my largest holding and I love that Shaq is on our team. I only hope he doesn't spread himself too thin and that we're able to have him on some online/tv commercials. I hope I'm doing my best to do my own promotional work by purchasing WTER products for my family and friends in an introductory manner and direct consumption in my home. I am also in the habit of asking any retailer I buy from who doesn't have our products on their shelf or menu for our products. These are small things but if repeated by hundreds of share holders it may have a material affect.
"Had for 2 years , I think they are now ready to move up. Troubles are over."
"This WTER must be Green today. After consolidating, back upwards we go."
I saw a88 at CVS for around $3 a gallon. IMO it's too dam much.
Getting hot everywhere. WTER drinking going up. The $2 mark is finally in sight. Maybe by month end.
This is completely normal always before earnings trying to shake off the paper items like Nate.
Rev is up year after but earning is dropping to. Not good sign
"Just looked at Q1 2021 presser from last year, says record revs of $14.2m. Now, Q1 2022 presser says record revs of $14.1m. Actually growth is slightly negative. How then can they state 5% y over y growth and 19.6% growth on two-year stacked basis (whatever that means LOL)?"
Year over year revenue growth of 20%. Guidance for fiscal 2022 is year over year growth of 35%. That’s rates as spectacular IMO.
Shook the tree and people picking up cheap shares. On the way up now.
Amazing the amount of effort shorts put into making the stock go down before close.
i dont trust mgt. after they [insiders] bought last yr. at $0.50 cents - i like the co. but its only existing to be sold ! im holding but am not expecting the $ 5 i had hoped for
Shaq sold
Good to see new investors coming in here
Someone talk to Larry - he is not drinking WTER. Larry your Alkalinity is going to be off.
We get our conference call Tuesday July 6th at 8:30am eastern time. Look forward to national marketing campaign plans and discussions on future earnings expectations.
It’s all so exciting
"WTER got a little ahead of itself recently and was bound to pull back, but this is only the beginning of a huge move, and there is no way I'm selling anytime soon."
Moon shot. Tickets in hand!
"Just 1 penny, can fat man push us to 1.76 today? Is he behind enhancing the sp?"
looking like 2.50 by Friday for sure.
"Profit taking, can’t blame em. A lot of shares got in at $1 or under."
"Just released,SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline water company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that this year’s sales in the all-important C-Store channel have more than doubled over the previous year. The Company attributes much of this growth to partnerships with several new major Direct-Store-Delivery providers and additional placements in six new distribution centers of legacy partners.“Our C-store channel sales are beginning to grow significantly. Last month alone, we grew by almost 300% in c-store sales, making it by far our most successful month in the company’s history. This is before the full impact of any of our new DSDs or six new distribution centers has even been felt,” said Richard A. Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “The Alkaline88 footprint continues to expand with each new distribution center added to our nationwide network. Recent additions to our network of distributors include Nassau Candy, Cooper Booth Wholesale, Hensley Beverage Company, Nevada Beverage Company, and National Convenience Distributors. Combined with our legacy partners, our network’s access now gives us the potential to service approximately 50,000 of the 150,000 convenience stores across the country. Between our traditional channels and C-stores, our single-serves are now available to more customers than ever before. Many of our single-serve SKUs, including our aluminum bottle and many of our flavored-infused waters, are on pace to significantly outperform their sales from last year. The C-store channel is a leader in bottled water sales with over $4.5 billion in sales last year, according to Convenience Store News. While we continue to see significant growth in our traditional channels, we anticipate that the convenience channel will meaningfully contribute to our fiscal year 2022 sales revenues.”"
Interesting news I did not know: nestle acquired essestia alkaline water co back in March when their sales hit around $190m
Good WTER!
Ho Ho Ho! Santa has a plan for under everyone’s tree! A88! Merry Christmas in July!

"Yahoo says revenue should be 48.6 mil, so i guess a miss. They announce an earnings report and two days later when it is due they are out of compliance and can't report. They have lost my trust."
They had me worried with the delay but I’m pleased with the numbers. Let’s go!
We have a WTER leak. Someone repair this leak please
"Like any stock, WTER has proponents and doubters. Objectively, I think its a good product in a vast sea of competitors. I recently bought Smartwater black label when I couldnt get A88 and my girlfriend said ""this "" one tastes bitter compared to the other stuff you usually buy"" Their income statement basically says to me they are spending money to make money. Yes, I'm happy with Shaq and hearing about new distr. agreements weekly & expanded manufacturing capacity. The test and my main concern these next 12mos (IMHO) is... will WTER generate the revenue for ongoing operations, or will there be another equity offering. GLTA."
What are we looking at as far as a stock price goes if it gets bought out or acquired?
Higher highs and higher lows is awesome!  Love the huge volume lately too!
WTER hit a 52 week high Friday.
Oh snap Shaq just bought in .. wayyyy in with his partners under an offering .. so here we go
I like my WTER.
"I have downed WTER for close to a year. First taking a small position and trading, the started accumulating into a larger position with a decent cost average to current SP. I was very bullish and continue to hope path forward is a sale of company. Never thought they could make it as a profitable company. Very hard to do in this industry with so many big players. Not sure how 2nd quarter earnings is going to play out in SP. Jay and others hopefully are right. Need to validate sales is increased market share not just entering of markets you never where in as reason for sales increase. This will determine if they are a buyout candidate. If they are not increasing market share in markets they have been established in then WTER will ultimately fail. GLTA and Happy 4th."
Shaq makes this real
Buyout rumors are swirling?
Once Coca-Cola buys this company it will be $50 for sure. Shaq has big plans.
Shorties realizing not only that its not going back under $2 but also it's about to go green for the day.
New just gets better every day.

"It looks to me like this has to move soon. Shaq and the management what I see are putting a lot of effort into promoting. Plus I keep thinking that with all the health concerns that people are waking up to the fact every detail helps, especially water from the right source."
Fantastic report released showing fantastic growth during a very difficult trading year and 2022 is looking significantly better. Things are going from strength to strength
We should be in the Green With this news ... https://www.instagram.com/p/CTU8DTmjR7_/?utm_medium=copy_link
"HAHAHA SHORTIEShttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline-water-company-records-another-201000266.htmlSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., August 16, 2021--The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the ""Company""), the country’s largest independent alkaline water co."
"From the PR today:""As we roll out Our First Ever traditional Marketing Campaign, we know that more customers will be looking for Alkaline88”I am loving what I'm seeing/reading, this is such a small cap in a multi billion market that's only growing as more and more people are awakening to a healthier lifestyle, less soda consumption etc... Then we have a CBD line, too, it is a no brainer to me the short and long term potential , my initial goal was 5$ but these are really re-adjusted depending on how strong we move so I am sitting comfortably on my shares here! GLTA"
This company needs to distance themselves from CBD and just focus on the water. That CBD idea cost a lot in public image.
2.25 would be a very nice close
Just would like to take this opportunity to thank the shorties for giving me a chance to load up again. Now it's going to be fun to watch you guys get crushed.
Keep rollin rollin rollin
Thank you for watching over our WTER!
Up 35% YTD. Woo Hoo!
Strong volume continues with after hours. Something brewing!
Common WTER break 2.00
Good afternoon to all you people out there!
Early pop!!!!!!
The beautiful slow rise continues
Making It Rain
Manipulation is strong right now. Don't let the shorts scare you. HOLD! at
Love new highs and new high lows. Signs of good movement.
I will not be paper hands. I I am diamond hands. Until it hits about 224 and then screw it I’m taking profit
Not seeing earnings scheduled for today on wter website calendar FYI
Think $1.88 by end of week!
SLAM Dunk!! Oh sorry that’s Shaw’s line. Will go with it’s pouring WTER on all the short baggies.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
I missed the dip.  Could of should of added. Nice bounce back gang.
INKW a better play and Return!
Great growth and gross margins at 40% Is this good relative to industry standards? Also operating expenses continue to be high. Is this a reflection of growth in and increased marketing costs?
"Good morning fellow ladies and gents, I’m so rich that I think I’m about to by a gun and hunt bears, I’ve also increased my position sooo hard to show off to the ladies"
@Jay. Have to give you a shoutout. 2 months ago you picked July 30th for date WTER would hot $2. Today it hit $2. Nice projection.
Beautiful bounce back so far. Shaq starts marketing next month....Get ready and bucket up!
"I remember when Howard Stern signed with Sirius, I had 22000 shares at $0.72 p/s. It jumped to $9. I sold my shares a little too early (at $6.59). Still was a nice haul. Maybe when Basketball season starts up this fall, Shaq will give A88 a lot of exposure, and we'll get a nice spike."
What I’d tell ya...
Love the energy. Lucky 88
"I’ll stay with WTER! The largest independent alkaline water company, and grows 20%+ year after year after year."
"I received a message from above, too the moon!"
SHAQ needs to get in his truck and TAKE a BOAT load of WTER WATER CASES down to the FOLKS in Louisianan . Those Folks need help!
"Well the profit taking did not break through $1.80. Like I shared, I love higher highs and higher lows. Back on up people. Woo Hoo."
Well that gain lasted all of NOTHING????
"Isn't Tom Hutchison the guy who just left SMSI last week? If so, he didn't do ""squat"" for them. Mick."
WTER reports record breaking revenue https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXYmu7czAnw
