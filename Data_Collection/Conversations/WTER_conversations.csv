Imminent sale to KO
"Just looked at Q1 2021 presser from last year, says record revs of $14.2m. Now, Q1 2022 presser says record revs of $14.1m. Actually growth is slightly negative. How then can they state 5% y over y growth and 19.6% growth on two-year stacked basis (whatever that means LOL)?"
I fully expect the company to eventually be bought out by Pepsi or Coke.
"10 Compelling Reasons to long WTER.1. The largest Shareholder is Shaq.2. State of the Art Technology that doesn't use Chemicals. Huge advantage over the competition.3. 89% compound annual growth rate over the past seven (7) years with no traditional advertising.4. Infused products will add revenue in 2022 by a substantial margin.5. #1 most efficient water company generating $2 million in revenue per employee; industry average is $220,000 per employee.6. Expansion into Mexico and Canada will generate massive revenue over the next three (3) years.7. Eight (8) Co-Packers strategically placed throughout the United States saves a significant amount in transportation costs.8. Prime Acquisition Target. Vitamin Water was purchased for $4.2 Billion. Alkaline88 is much more diversified that any and all recent acquisitions by Big Beverage. BodyArmor handed it's shareholders a 3,200% return. WTER market cap is a measly $169 million; this is laughable.9. WTER is fortunate enough to be part of a MEGA-TREND with consumers drinking less soda. This bodes extremely well for WTER.10. Food for thought. If WTER is bought for $3 Billion in a year or two, based on WTER's total outstanding 104.2 million shares, a $3 Billion acquisition price puts WTER at exactly $28.79 a share. If this number is cut in half, WTER will be acquired for $14.40 per share making the acquisition a measly $1.5 Billion. If WTER is purchased for the exact amount Vitamin Water was purchased for, the share price of WTER would be exactly $40.31. These are statistical facts; not opinion. WTER, the Best is Yet to Come. Buying and Holding WTER is a no brainer."

"Let's have little fun. Jay was lucky last time as he got it right with nothing to back him. What is the sp on Oct 31? Since Oct 31 is Sunday, then we use the opening price on Nov 1."
We need the big man shack on the TV promoting this company? Soon soon soon
"Don't want to go to the moon, just $3 per share, is this too much to ask. Can we send Shaq packing?"
lol... sigh
Well maybe buck 55 will be the low today.
To allWe all can exchange info and express our thought but BJ cross the line and I hope you all stop him and push him away. We all have parents but not sure about him. Please help me educate Bobby Lee (*not sure if this is his real name)Thank you

why doesn't the sams club news get more investor traction...this seems like a big deal to me.....
"Seems all the hype with Shaq being involved with WTER is fading just a little. Saw where Shaq did another TV add with another company, nothing to do with water thank goodness. Hopefully very soon Shaq might be seen on TV holding a bottle of WTER which would certainly help move the stock. JMO GLTA"
Patience people. This could be $3.00 or more by summer 2022.
"I see my ""USEFUL INFORMATION"" post has disappeared. I'm very peeved over that. Was it hackers (Russia, China or a friendly country), the flaws of the internet or Yahoo? Either way I'm po'ed. I believe in providing important factors related to potential investments based on research.Anyway let me post the most important item of the aforementioned post.The co-packer in Florida responsible for supplying Sam's Club has an end-to-end solution. They produce the bottle, label water and have shipping capabilities.Another thing I did not mention is Wal-Mart's main location (home office and distribution point) is in Arkansas.What happened to the ""Shaq Pac""? Hmmm!!See below."

"WTER continues to do a great job of diluting our shares. Effective as of September 20, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,809,522 shares of our common stock upon exercise of our common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $1.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,761,902.50. We issued these shares to three non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) in an offshore transaction"
This price of 1.65 is a bargain. Added 2000 shares this AM. This will quadruple by next year this time.
Good morning!
"This seriously does not make since to me. 10% down in the past 4 days, before the earning call today? Someone please enlighten me. If sales are going well, why would they need money and have more shares outstanding as they only have 10 employees and outsource everything. The CEO is not making millions on the profit?"
"Another dilution of shareholder value. 83,000 shares. Looks to be some type of equity bonus granted prior. Not sure why a company that has not yet learned to make money is giving out bonuses. For me I made a decision to stay in until the effect of the National Marketing is realized. Better be good."
Bullish. Finally
Nice day. More to come.
Shorts covering late
Mute feature is great!
"Just for the record, anyone expecting profitability this quarter will be disappointed.The sales will need to increase significantly before any Net Income will appear.Sales increases and available cash are the most important items to be concerned about.This, IMO, should be viewed as a growth company. They have climbed from the 10th to 8th ranked best-selling premium water in recent months. Now if A88 water does not continue increasing sales that will be a huge problem."
Power close please!

We have a WTER leak. Someone repair this leak please
I still feel good about this.
WTER is the essence of life
Not seeing earnings scheduled for today on wter website calendar FYI
They mentioned they were in Vegas filming a commercial with Shaq. It doesn't matter how many stores you get into if people don't recognize your name. Get on with releasing the commercials so people can REQUEST your product from their neighborhood stores if they don't have it. Commercials create interest & interest creates 'word of mouth' advertising...which is better & costs nothing.

if there's a dude named Kevin on here trying to claim that alkaline water has made offerings or sold shares within this company do not pay him any attention. He has provided no proof of this whatsoever it is just him running his mouth m He is a paid short claiming that he sold three quarters of his stock and has 20% left over but yet ridicules the stock constantly. I would definitely block this dude He is no good.
Yahoo posting 4 days to earnings call now. However nothing on WTER investor relations site IR calendar.
i dont trust mgt. after they [insiders] bought last yr. at $0.50 cents - i like the co. but its only existing to be sold ! im holding but am not expecting the $ 5 i had hoped for
wet days are ahead
All good 
for all those waiting for Shaq NBA season started yesterday Shaq will be on TNT very soon with a bottle in his hand. Also it doesn't hurt to get on his Twitter handle and tell him to start pumping the stock :-)
WTER turns green as market turns green!
"Happy with the report. Will be watching for further expansion in the price-club, CBD and single serve segments."
"Well Premarket attention going on with 175,000 shares traded already!"
"Charts show the simple 50 day moving average is $1.80. The next resistance is $1.90, but then clear sailing to $2.15 resistance. GL WTERs!"
"I remember when Howard Stern signed with Sirius, I had 22000 shares at $0.72 p/s. It jumped to $9. I sold my shares a little too early (at $6.59). Still was a nice haul. Maybe when Basketball season starts up this fall, Shaq will give A88 a lot of exposure, and we'll get a nice spike."
"DOT Foods to Offer A88 Infused as a Featured All-Natural Flavored ProductSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 01, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (the “Company”), is a producer of premium bottled alkaline water, flavor-infused waters, and CBD infused products sold under the brand names Alkaline88, A88 Infused, and A88CBD, respectively. Today, the Company announced that its A88 Infused flavors will be a featured product offered by DOT Foods in the all-natural and specialty beverages category.“Our partnership with DOT Foods is off to a strong start. The distributor will offer our A88 Infused flavors brand as a featured item in their all-natural flavored water product category,” stated Ricky Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company ( WTER ). “This will give access to over 600,000 restaurants and foodservice establishments across all 50 states. The hospitality sector provides us a unique and huge opportunity that far exceeds our current served market. In addition to targeting the universe of retailers served by DOT Foods, we expect to penetrate this space in a disciplined and calculated manner and initially will target Golf Foodservices, Fast Casuals, and Vending and Micro Markets. Despite our aggressive efforts, the hospitality space recovery will be the primary growth driver for this category. We believe that our all-natural single-serve offerings, including our eco-friendly aluminum bottles, A88 Infused flavors, and the newly launched A88CBD infused flavored water, will do exceptionally well in this segment. Healthful living continues to remain a dominant trend in the markets we serve, and our lifestyle brands are well-positioned with a strong partner network to drive strong growth in existing and new channels.”"
"The Shaq Pack- brilliant. The National Marketing campaign starts. Here we go!!! Company bought out in a year - 5 bagger. Shaquille O‘Neal has partnered with The Alkaline Water Company for its first-ever comprehensive, omnichannel marketing campaign."
Called that price pretty good today. it's Friday tomorrow so realistic prediction because of selling will be around 1.80 before close. GL WTER family
"I agree we are going way up but…Shares of Alkaline Water slumped double-digits last week, following the company’s lukewarm June quarter earnings report. Revenue for the quarter rose 5% year-over-year, and the management team shared the balance sheet should be flush following the completion of the private placement deal that brought Shaquille O’Neal as the company’s brand ambassador. We would note the company discussed “an unexpected $1.3 million additional expenses from our supply chain and logistics related to the aftermath of COVID-19,” but there was no mention of this when Alkaline reported its March quarter’s results on July 6."
"Based on all the warrants, etc exercised recently the company should have sufficient funds to operate for some time before having to raise any additional money.This company has operated on thin management ranks until recently. They have recently hired numerous people to fill out important positions for the exponential expansion that's expected.With the recently signed ABG-SHAQ agreement I suspect the sales expansion will be much better than expected.NOTE: I have recently had an opportunity to sample the product. IMO their water is very good. I have not tried any of the competitive companies products.However, I hate plain water. So, for me, to say I like their water is surprising. I never drink water without adding powder flavoring. As a matter of fact I purchased 5 gallon sized jugs: 2 from Wal-Mart and 3 from Food Lion."

"Since July 28, it went as low as $1.72. So the summer is almost gone and we are at $1.66 (the lowest since 7/28/2021), where is Shaq? Where is the pop of the summer?"
It’s all so exciting
Go WTER! SHAQ is in the paint!

Amazing the amount of effort shorts put into making the stock go down before close.
just bought another 700 shares on this dip. I have not seen these prices in quite a while.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alkaline-water-company-host-conference-131500371.html
I scooped up some more shares. Love the sale today. I’m a long.
"It looks to me like this has to move soon. Shaq and the management what I see are putting a lot of effort into promoting. Plus I keep thinking that with all the health concerns that people are waking up to the fact every detail helps, especially water from the right source."
This company needs to distance themselves from CBD and just focus on the water. That CBD idea cost a lot in public image.
looks like we had some nice buying pressure from perhaps an institution gave a nice little bump to the stock
Per CEO interview they have already shot commercials with Shaq. Once those roll out it will be game on.
I wonder what shorty decided to short WTER around $1? Any guesses?
"Breakdown of 10KThe following comments are addressed to anyone interested in investing for their future and don't have time to evaluate this company, etc. I do have a request, if my research and commentary are helpful, please help those less fortunate and are having it difficult in life.I will tag future comments to this thread for convenience.I believe this company has potential.

The 2nd quarter closes on 09/30. The results and c.c. will occur on or about 11/15.I'm predicting sales will be about 16+ million dollars. That's about a 50% increase YOY. I believe that qualifies as a growth stock.The most important items to watch for IMO are listed below:1 - the amount of cash on the balance sheet.2 - the increase in sales.3 - any comments on advertising plans.4 - comments on sales of individual sized servings of plain and flavored water.
How can you sell a bottle of water for $3.00 when a case of regular bottles of 24 goes for $4.99
Nice again. Back to $2.00. 
one thing is for sure Kevin is a shortie and is going to be crying when this thing goes 10x when it gets bought up by Coke or Pepsi and the next year. Good luck shorties You're going to burn bad on this one Shaq never loses on any stock and he is heavily invested in this one.
Silly early morning sellers.
"Hopefully they're seeing a lot of interest this week (Thurs, Fri & Sat) at the trade show! Maybe some new distributers & store sign-ups. Fingers crossed! Hopefully they'll out a PR next week letting us know how it went. Happy weekend all!"
well shorties are definitely here so that's good news for the stock

The approval is required by 09/30/21 Vancouver Canada time.I've notified everyone on here before. However with all the excitement in the beautiful videos posted here I'm sure no one remembers.How does nonsense video help anyone understand this company ?
I love it! I believe it! I’m not a shorty. SHAQ will bring more!
I've been trying to tell y'all this for months about Shaq's effect on this stock and look what is happening off the first piece pf big news. Once Shaq starts really marketing we are going to the moon baby! 
just received my 88 water and wow. soooo refreshing I'm in for long haul.... hopefully it'll be another monster beverage type price

Here we go baby!https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/04/2307899/0/en/The-Alkaline-Water-Company-Inc-NASDAQ-WTER-CSE-WTER-Expands-into-High-Potential-Channels-Categories.html
"Just released,SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline water company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that this year’s sales in the all-important C-Store channel have more than doubled over the previous year. The Company attributes much of this growth to partnerships with several new major Direct-Store-Delivery providers and additional placements in six new distribution centers of legacy partners.“Our C-store channel sales are beginning to grow significantly. Last month alone, we grew by almost 300% in c-store sales, making it by far our most successful month in the company’s history. This is before the full impact of any of our new DSDs or six new distribution centers has even been felt,” said Richard A. Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “The Alkaline88 footprint continues to expand with each new distribution center added to our nationwide network. Recent additions to our network of distributors include Nassau Candy, Cooper Booth Wholesale, Hensley Beverage Company, Nevada Beverage Company, and National Convenience Distributors. Combined with our legacy partners, our network’s access now gives us the potential to service approximately 50,000 of the 150,000 convenience stores across the country. Between our traditional channels and C-stores, our single-serves are now available to more customers than ever before. Many of our single-serve SKUs, including our aluminum bottle and many of our flavored-infused waters, are on pace to significantly outperform their sales from last year. The C-store channel is a leader in bottled water sales with over $4.5 billion in sales last year, according to Convenience Store News. While we continue to see significant growth in our traditional channels, we anticipate that the convenience channel will meaningfully contribute to our fiscal year 2022 sales revenues.”"
"Wter is down almost 7% today. Why, what has changed in the company from say, last week? Nothing. Am I missing something?"

Water is my largest holding and I love that Shaq is on our team. I only hope he doesn't spread himself too thin and that we're able to have him on some online/tv commercials. I hope I'm doing my best to do my own promotional work by purchasing WTER products for my family and friends in an introductory manner and direct consumption in my home. I am also in the habit of asking any retailer I buy from who doesn't have our products on their shelf or menu for our products. These are small things but if repeated by hundreds of share holders it may have a material affect.

Prediction today possibly we close at 1.70-1.75 depending how it goes at the NCAS show. We can get all the great news in the world but if we're not getting buying pressure it doesn't matter . So fingers crossed..
Good to see new investors coming in here
Short baggies Tam Ga and Larry fooled again. Up up 
"like I said Shaq has already and pretty much priced into the stock. That's why you don't see a huge movement today. The real meat and potatoes is in the Q3 and Q,4 reports.."
Good morning Water World !
SHAQ should get all the credit for today’s Sam’s Club addition. I bet he played a significant role. Thank you!
Making It Rain
Let’s be honest. This thing is going to get bought…..soon. I’m all in and hodling.
Shaq will start marketing soon wait for it.
omg here we go again ... delay the QER!!! Why?Last time during the annual ER ... Not sure if they ever give a clear reason. TD reported 8/11 the 8/12 then 8/13 all because they receive info directly from someone (I assumed Alkaline88)What are they trying to hide?Does anyone able to calculate how many shares they have? How many shares Shaq still hold?
Deadensyde
You paint a pretty picture
I’m so glad that I had unloaded this turkey at $2.25!!! The only way it broke over $1 was through a huge reverse split.
"In my previous comments or replies to other persons comments I addressed two items.1- the importance of the single serve drinks. It, IMO, is the most important part of their expansion plans. Many people are always on the move and want to have a drink when thirsty. Thus the companies desire for more expansion into convenience stores, gyms, airports, etc is currently being promulgated. This segment already represents 16% of total company sales. In the not too distant future it will be the largest portion of sales. Additionally it's more profitable for the company: higher margins.2 - this is for the speculation crowd. I mentioned PepsiCo as the possible acquirer of WTER in response to someone else' post. At that time I mentioned that Pepsi had sold off their generic branded water and wanted to expand further into premium branded water.Well since then it has come to my attention that Pepsi has the CURRENT contract to supply drinks to Papa Johns pizza. I don't know when it expires, however, I wonder if Mr O'Neal (Shaq) may convince management of Papa John's to change suppliers. It's entirely possible.Per the new ratings, just released, WTER overtook the PepsiCo water brand for the #8 position. I guarantee you PepsiCo management took notice of this.Just sayin'!!!!"
So excited by good Q1 numbers they are having the call 45 days early
"Doesn’t this say something that they will not be at Sky Harbor Airport, right in there backyard????"
"Do you think Shaq is sitting in meetings with management every day ??? Bear in mind. that Shaq has a handful of college degrees, including an MBA from Arizona university."

Added a little in premarket. Pause and consolidation in SP was good and believe once the National Marketing Campaign is in full cycle it will bring a lot of attention to WTER and we will see another lift in SP. long game believe this company gets bought as their strategy looks focused only on increasing sales and market share for that to happen.
"What concerns me... I live in aurora Indiana 50 miles west of cincinnati,oh. The krogers in lawrenceburg is out of the water more often than not. I like that their expanding but they have to keep their current customers stocked. Krogers wont hesitate to fill the shelves with their own products."
Hey fellow minions. We hit the $1.50’s Support again. Enjoy the ride to the $1.80’s by Friday then sell. ALWAYS TAKE THE PROFITS !!!!
WOW! A88 new infused water with the Vessl tech is awesome. The packaging is right on. Attaboy A88.
So at the NACS show yesterday in Chicago apparently alkaline 88 did such a great job that several investors put in large-scale orders that is why the stock shot up so quickly. today they are presenting again at the show so we could perhaps see another huge bump up which would create momentum that we need.
"When was the last time you were able to view our company presentation? what kind of update that requires more than a week? Does anyone know our current # shares? 50 million, 75 million, 100 million?"
Here we go
My guess is Tam GA and Larry have short calls around the 1.60 mark and are losing very bad 
Thanks for more cheap shares.   
I could see the stock going to $19
just bought another 1100 shares ....
Will we see another spike post lunch? Maybe.
Interesting news I did not know: nestle acquired essestia alkaline water co back in March when their sales hit around $190m
Love the energy. Lucky 88
"Short squeeze tomorrow? I’m not sure if there are many shorts, likely not I would think."
"WTER got a little ahead of itself recently and was bound to pull back, but this is only the beginning of a huge move, and there is no way I'm selling anytime soon."
2.25 would be a very nice close
"Started drinking this a year ago , had no Idea it would help with gout flare up. I'm a fan and purchased my 1st 15 shares today."

that spike to 1.73 looks like a big buy. .. Gonna do some research but volume could be big tomorrow.
That's more like it l. Go Baby Go
Wter was just added to the CSE composite 25 index.
Beat down by shorts all day and bounce back like a champion.... You want to know why???
"sometimes I catch myself being a little negative at this stock, well because if you've been in this for a long time like me there has been ups and downs and and a lot of disappointment. However I have to remind myself that those days are over and all the waiting is about to pay off. so I apologize if I came off negative about shaq's commercial I'm just excited as everybody but I also don't want everybody to get their hopes up if we don't skyrocket right away, and then get disappointed and sell. However time is definitely on our side, we have finally turned the corner and all the longs will be making alot of money very soon .. Poor Tam GA "
"Now THAT'S a great PR! I love the new vessl cap, makes me think of ""freshness"". I want to run out & buy the lemon-lime flavor now."

Consumers will see the advisory board member and beloved brand ambassador, Shaquille O’Neal, and Alkaline88 in multiple formats across all media channels including 30-second and 15-second commercials on digital platforms and television."
Beautiful bounce back so far. Shaq starts marketing next month....Get ready and bucket up!

hey Kevin I don't know where you get your DD at but read the first sentence in this article Shaq has not been paid all his shares yet it will be 3 years of installmentsl... have a good dayhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/shaquille-o-neal-to-pitch-alkaline-water-brand-under-equity-pact
"Interview with SHAQ here, https://taxunfiltered.com/2021/09/23/shaq-alkaline-water-wter/, shows sincere side of him."
Good ol Monday manipulation
Holiday Hydration gift box coming soon? Television? Radio? Social Media? I like the idea!
looking for a nice bounce in the power hour
"I’ve been waiting for the dilution bottom to hit $1.50’s Now is the time to pick up shares. I bought 100,000 today. $2.50-3.00 by EOY"
Hold on tight!
"Still holding long, I think this company has a great future. Especially while taking in to account that there is currently less than 2% of drinkable water left on our planet... people can love without cloth or with-ought homes with ought cash but hell no one can make it without water... so... I am long on WTER"

"Just curious as of 11:51 AM EST, Day's Range 1.6200 - 1.7000, and it closed Friday at 1.70, so after-hour and pre-market did not even move 1 penny!!? We are losing in real time. Where is Shaq?"
Mighty fine day building new base.
"@Tam Ga if you want to know when the commercials w/Shaq are going to be released & other advertising, may I suggest that you email the new Chief Marketing Officer, Tom Hutchison? He should know. I already stated that they filmed a commercial with Shaq in Vegas last month. He should know when it's going to be released. Pls let us know what you find out."
Just would like to take this opportunity to thank the shorties for giving me a chance to load up again. Now it's going to be fun to watch you guys get crushed.
"Nothing but good things going on here. The Shaq will only take the stock price higher. I'd like to see $4.50 by 1st Qtr 2022 and I'm out, if not sooner."
I’m under someone’s skin. Just can’t let me go. Funny though. GL.
"I think they'll do great in California with this product. I, personally, love the vessl cap...it screams freshness, freshness, freshness!"
You guys know I've been here for awhile (I was Space OG also) and I have to admit I am thoroughly confused on what is going on lately with this stock. there seems to be nothing but great news everyday and today was one of the biggest days for news but yet no momentum whatsoever. so my only conclusion is the stock is being heavy manipulated right now. I'm going to hold like I've been doing for the past couple years but if it dips back under a dollar I'm going to strongly consider getting out I have to admit it finally. Yes it's a red day in the market and I know I'm the one that usually preaches that but there's a lot of stocks that have momentum and are going green today alkaline 88 should be one of those. Don't get me wrong I'm still in love with this stock but red flags signaling manipulation by Hedge Funds are going up now.
lol Notice shortie Kevin is no where to be found now 
Won't hit $1.52 today. I know things.
"Ok, getting my feet wet here. Betting SHAQ will be doing national campaigns that got Sam’s Club on board."
alkaline and Shaq hmmm load up
will someone buy them out or no?

I'll say it again The stock was up to $2.25 less than 2 months ago without shaq's advertisement. Shaq is just going to be the cherry on top that pushes this over $3 and hopefully gets us a buyout very soon.Don't be a naive and think Coca-Cola has not been paying attention to all the work alkaline is done this last month. I guarantee they are going to want to buy out the number one independent alkaline water company for another company gets their hands on it. TRUST THE PROCESS HOLDING IS FREE
Larry is a Buyer tomorrow. SP blows thru $2.50 on 50% +sales increase and outline of National Marketing plan coming soon this Fall.
Bullish
Until Shaq starts showing his face on Television showing WTER in his hand and touting his words about this product I'm afraid WTER will remain at these price levels..I hope I'm wrong but we'll see..
SHAQ needs to get in his truck and TAKE a BOAT load of WTER WATER CASES down to the FOLKS in Louisianan . Those Folks need help!
Well this will now resume its march higher. Short baggies will be baling hard tomorrow. Expect 10% + pop and move to $3 over next few weeks.
"Omni-channel advertising w/Shaq, broke into the club market, new CBD waters with the Vessl tech. Costco placement and PepsiCo buyout coming soon. Attaboy!"
"After 6 months they finally make their move, just today they made their announcement. I expect a big jump. Let's see how the market re-act the next few days, not looking good the first 30 minutes ... Let's the game begin."
"This is the traction from investors in the know. Majority of people haven’t even heard of A88, all about to change."
Expect a decent gain back in AH. I think the shorts have beat it down as far as it can go to. 175 seems to be strong resistance. I definitely expect a Green Day tomorrow
Hold! $2+ coming soon!

Good morning everyoneHope to hear from Shaq or see a national marketing campaign today
"Base on his official wiki, his last 3 team only last 1 year each. In professional sport he has 2 choices, either retire or get cut. But both mean the same thing - too old"
Watched a whole trailer of Alkaline water get offloaded at a WMT distribution center. A lot of people buying WTER
For those of you screaming for Shaq...Here you go. The new Shaq Paq 2 litter's CBD infused water with his beautiful face on the cover. This is just the beginning.https://cspdailynews.com/beverages/alkaline88-maker-collaborates-shaq
"You have to admit the rapid distribution channel expansion of this company is pretty impressive.“We continue to make great strides toward our c-store strategy and see strong demand for our single-serve offerings,” stated Ricky Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “Our flagship brand, Alkaline88, is now available in seven Core-Mark distribution centers, giving us access to thousands of new c-stores across the United States. With Core-Mark representing approximately 11,000 stores nationwide, we have the opportunity to present our lifestyle brands to some of the largest regional, national, and independently owned c-store chains. We recently added FastTrip, Colbea, Kenk, and CN Brown as new accounts, with each serving at least 40 locations. These company-owned and serviced stores are primarily gas station locations operating under various banners, including Shell, Mobile, CITGO, ARCO, etc. Most of these new accounts will carry our 1-gallon, 1.5-ltr, and 1-ltr single-serve offerings, which are seeing strong interest across all trades. We expect our single-serve offerings, which include eco-friendly aluminum bottles and flavor-infused waters, to drive substantial growth during our current fiscal year as a result of this increased distribution capacity.”"
"I don't think we'll see any positive movement until, (1) Commercials with Shaq are released and (2) the financials are released in November. People need to see the numbers, positive numbers. I thought we would move upwards with the other day's news, loved the new bottle cap with flavorings idea! It's just a waiting game right now. Glta"

"Bobby Lee, the other day you asked about the flavored water (A88 Infused Beverage) co-packers. Specifically you were concerned with continued outages displayed on the companies website.I'm not done researching yet, but I wanted to provide what I've found so far.1 - I believe that Waco Bottling in Waco, Texas is currently the only co-packer. If I find out differently I'll advise accordingly.2 - Per the 10K/A for year end 03/31/2021 the company has plans to add 3 - 5 co-packers for expected increase in flavor water sales.Any future comments will be added to this post for convenience.I hope this helps."
Bozo filtering happening tmrw
Had a feeling might be a red day after the huge run-up early. Still in great shape don't sell.

When you start seeing new names come out of nowhere on this board be careful More than likely they are the same ol shorts just with different accounts. GA etc..
Why rooting for Shaq when he is MIA? Also do read 8k to see why alkaline88 keep printing more shares to pay for Shaq causing the shareprice to decrease! Do we have anyone beside Larry reading the SEC filing?
Woo Hoo! I like WTER at these prices. I’m back in to see 2 dollar +.
I'm all in when it hits .90

"From the PR today:""As we roll out Our First Ever traditional Marketing Campaign, we know that more customers will be looking for Alkaline88”I am loving what I'm seeing/reading, this is such a small cap in a multi billion market that's only growing as more and more people are awakening to a healthier lifestyle, less soda consumption etc... Then we have a CBD line, too, it is a no brainer to me the short and long term potential , my initial goal was 5$ but these are really re-adjusted depending on how strong we move so I am sitting comfortably on my shares here!

"I continue to see very few bottles of alkaline 88 water on the shelves at the local Kroger every time I buy some. There used to be plenty, but this is becoming a very popular brand now. I bought 3 gallon sized bottles today, which left only a few remaining. Translation? I'm not selling."
"This is a great marketing play for brand awareness and a lot of water is sod at airports. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that its 1-liter and 700ml bottles of Alkaline88 will be available in over 100 retail locations in nine major U.S. airports including JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Reagan National, Orlando International, George Bush Intercontinental/Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul International, and Philadelphia International. In what will be an immediate boon to the brand’s international awareness, hundreds of millions of passengers flying to over 250 destinations around the world will soon be able to enjoy Deliciously Smooth Alkaline88 on their journey."
