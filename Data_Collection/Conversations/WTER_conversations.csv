looks like we had some nice buying pressure from perhaps an institution gave a nice little bump to the stock
Last chance to buy under $1.70?

Bozo filtering happening tmrw
that spike to 1.73 looks like a big buy. .. Gonna do some research but volume could be big tomorrow.
Wter was just added to the CSE composite 25 index.
I just saw Alkaline88 in Lidl stores LI NY.
Water added to 350 GNC stores nation wide. News out 2 hrs ago.
"@Tam Ga if you want to know when the commercials w/Shaq are going to be released & other advertising, may I suggest that you email the new Chief Marketing Officer, Tom Hutchison? He should know. I already stated that they filmed a commercial with Shaq in Vegas last month. He should know when it's going to be released. Pls let us know what you find out."
"I remember when Howard Stern signed with Sirius, I had 22000 shares at $0.72 p/s. It jumped to $9. I sold my shares a little too early (at $6.59). Still was a nice haul. Maybe when Basketball season starts up this fall, Shaq will give A88 a lot of exposure, and we'll get a nice spike."
if there's a dude named Kevin on here trying to claim that alkaline water has made offerings or sold shares within this company do not pay him any attention. He has provided no proof of this whatsoever it is just him running his mouth m He is a paid short claiming that he sold three quarters of his stock and has 20% left over but yet ridicules the stock constantly. I would definitely block this dude He is no good.
"Admittedly, I've been frustrated with this stock lately & disillusioned, but no now. Can't wait to try the new infused waters! I am bullish again!!"
Good Morning A88!
Added a little in premarket. Pause and consolidation in SP was good and believe once the National Marketing Campaign is in full cycle it will bring a lot of attention to WTER and we will see another lift in SP. long game believe this company gets bought as their strategy looks focused only on increasing sales and market share for that to happen.
"This is the traction from investors in the know. Majority of people haven’t even heard of A88, all about to change."
why doesn't the sams club news get more investor traction...this seems like a big deal to me.....
"Seems all the hype with Shaq being involved with WTER is fading just a little. Saw where Shaq did another TV add with another company, nothing to do with water thank goodness. Hopefully very soon Shaq might be seen on TV holding a bottle of WTER which would certainly help move the stock. JMO GLTA"
"Still holding long, I think this company has a great future. Especially while taking in to account that there is currently less than 2% of drinkable water left on our planet... people can love without cloth or with-ought homes with ought cash but hell no one can make it without water... so... I am long on WTER"
Well maybe buck 55 will be the low today.
"I’m thirsty, can I plz have som water?"

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/within-water-trend-sales-alkaline-151718030.htmlNetworkNewsWire Editorial Coverage: As recently as 2015, the retail sales for alkaline waters, those with a pH between 7.0 and 10.0, were less than $95 million..."
"Bobby Lee, the other day you asked about the flavored water (A88 Infused Beverage) co-packers. Specifically you were concerned with continued outages displayed on the companies website.I'm not done researching yet, but I wanted to provide what I've found so far.1 - I believe that Waco Bottling in Waco, Texas is currently the only co-packer. If I find out differently I'll advise accordingly.2 - Per the 10K/A for year end 03/31/2021 the company has plans to add 3 - 5 co-packers for expected increase in flavor water sales.Any future comments will be added to this post for convenience.I hope this helps."
wet days are ahead
I could see the stock going to $19
"This is a great marketing play for brand awareness and a lot of water is sod at airports. The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that its 1-liter and 700ml bottles of Alkaline88 will be available in over 100 retail locations in nine major U.S. airports including JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Reagan National, Orlando International, George Bush Intercontinental/Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul International, and Philadelphia International. In what will be an immediate boon to the brand’s international awareness, hundreds of millions of passengers flying to over 250 destinations around the world will soon be able to enjoy Deliciously Smooth Alkaline88 on their journey."
"Another dilution of shareholder value. 83,000 shares. Looks to be some type of equity bonus granted prior. Not sure why a company that has not yet learned to make money is giving out bonuses. For me I made a decision to stay in until the effect of the National Marketing is realized. Better be good."
The 2nd quarter closes on 09/30. The results and c.c. will occur on or about 11/15.I'm predicting sales will be about 16+ million dollars. That's about a 50% increase YOY. I believe that qualifies as a growth stock.The most important items to watch for IMO are listed below:1 - the amount of cash on the balance sheet.2 - the increase in sales.3 - any comments on advertising plans.4 - comments on sales of individual sized servings of plain and flavored water.
Expect a decent gain back in AH. I think the shorts have beat it down as far as it can go to. 175 seems to be strong resistance. I definitely expect a Green Day tomorrow
Thanks for more cheap shares.   
Go WTER! SHAQ is in the paint!

Holiday Hydration gift box coming soon? Television? Radio? Social Media? I like the idea!
Way too much pumping for a lousy stock!!!
Good morning everyoneHope to hear from Shaq or see a national marketing campaign today
I like WTER.
Won't hit $1.52 today. I know things.
Per CEO interview they have already shot commercials with Shaq. Once those roll out it will be game on.
"What does Ricky mean when he said (in news shown below by VADER) ""raw material manufacturers"". Is he talking about packaging stuff or the water and ingredients? Anybody know???"
Will we see another spike post lunch? Maybe.
WTER turns green as market turns green!
I’m under someone’s skin. Just can’t let me go. Funny though. GL.
"Let's have little fun. Jay was lucky last time as he got it right with nothing to back him. What is the sp on Oct 31? Since Oct 31 is Sunday, then we use the opening price on Nov 1."

Good morning!
lol... sigh
Woo Hoo! I like WTER at these prices. I’m back in to see 2 dollar +.
Beautiful bounce back so far. Shaq starts marketing next month....Get ready and bucket up!
"In my previous comments or replies to other persons comments I addressed two items.1- the importance of the single serve drinks. It, IMO, is the most important part of their expansion plans. Many people are always on the move and want to have a drink when thirsty. Thus the companies desire for more expansion into convenience stores, gyms, airports, etc is currently being promulgated. This segment already represents 16% of total company sales. In the not too distant future it will be the largest portion of sales. Additionally it's more profitable for the company: higher margins.2 - this is for the speculation crowd. I mentioned PepsiCo as the possible acquirer of WTER in response to someone else' post. At that time I mentioned that Pepsi had sold off their generic branded water and wanted to expand further into premium branded water.Well since then it has come to my attention that Pepsi has the CURRENT contract to supply drinks to Papa Johns pizza. I don't know when it expires, however, I wonder if Mr O'Neal (Shaq) may convince management of Papa John's to change suppliers. It's entirely possible.Per the new ratings, just released, WTER overtook the PepsiCo water brand for the #8 position. I guarantee you PepsiCo management took notice of this.Just sayin'!!!!"
That's more like it l. Go Baby Go
I scooped up some more shares. Love the sale today. I’m a long.
All good 
Nice again. Back to $2.00. 
cute commercials!
"Started drinking this a year ago , had no Idea it would help with gout flare up. I'm a fan and purchased my 1st 15 shares today."
You guys know I've been here for awhile (I was Space OG also) and I have to admit I am thoroughly confused on what is going on lately with this stock. there seems to be nothing but great news everyday and today was one of the biggest days for news but yet no momentum whatsoever. so my only conclusion is the stock is being heavy manipulated right now. I'm going to hold like I've been doing for the past couple years but if it dips back under a dollar I'm going to strongly consider getting out I have to admit it finally. Yes it's a red day in the market and I know I'm the one that usually preaches that but there's a lot of stocks that have momentum and are going green today alkaline 88 should be one of those. Don't get me wrong I'm still in love with this stock but red flags signaling manipulation by Hedge Funds are going up now.

Good morning Water World !
"Just curious as of 11:51 AM EST, Day's Range 1.6200 - 1.7000, and it closed Friday at 1.70, so after-hour and pre-market did not even move 1 penny!!? We are losing in real time. Where is Shaq?"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqnf-2-1PuE
"The Shaq Pack- brilliant. The National Marketing campaign starts. Here we go!!! Company bought out in a year - 5 bagger. Shaquille O‘Neal has partnered with The Alkaline Water Company for its first-ever comprehensive, omnichannel marketing campaign."
"Since July 28, it went as low as $1.72. So the summer is almost gone and we are at $1.66 (the lowest since 7/28/2021), where is Shaq? Where is the pop of the summer?"
I've been trying to tell y'all this for months about Shaq's effect on this stock and look what is happening off the first piece pf big news. Once Shaq starts really marketing we are going to the moon baby! 
hey Kevin I don't know where you get your DD at but read the first sentence in this article Shaq has not been paid all his shares yet it will be 3 years of installmentsl... have a good dayhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/shaquille-o-neal-to-pitch-alkaline-water-brand-under-equity-pact
"Nothing but good things going on here. The Shaq will only take the stock price higher. I'd like to see $4.50 by 1st Qtr 2022 and I'm out, if not sooner."
To allWe all can exchange info and express our thought but BJ cross the line and I hope you all stop him and push him away. We all have parents but not sure about him. Please help me educate Bobby Lee (*not sure if this is his real name)Thank you
always has been resistance at 1.68... we break that it's on 2.00 easy

"Ok, getting my feet wet here. Betting SHAQ will be doing national campaigns that got Sam’s Club on board."
"Base on his official wiki, his last 3 team only last 1 year each. In professional sport he has 2 choices, either retire or get cut. But both mean the same thing - too old"
This price of 1.65 is a bargain. Added 2000 shares this AM. This will quadruple by next year this time.
"Tutorial time (for anyone interested).10K - Annual report from a publicly listed company. This is the Holy grail for useful information related to the reporting company. It contains financial statements, management discussions, exhibits (item 15) and almost anything else you may want to know about said company.10Q - this is a quarterly report which is provided 3 times a year. It's similar to 10K, but provides much less details.Form S-3 registration statement - it's used to inform shareholders of the BoD desire to sell additional stock. Mainly to fund operations, etc.Stockholders equity section of the balance sheet. Here you will find what types of stock have been approved by BoD, retained earnings or deficit (obviously not good), Treasury stock and things of that nature.Each approved stock (preferred and common) consists of 3 types of classification - authorized, issued and outstanding.Authorized - the maximum number of shares that can be sold by company without further approval which requires amendment to articles of incorporation.Issued - in general this equals the outstanding count. Outstanding - total number of shares issued and sold.Treasury stock - shares that are repurchased by the company which are NOT cancelled. They can be used for stock options, warrants or resold.That's all for now."
Bullish. Finally
When you start seeing new names come out of nowhere on this board be careful More than likely they are the same ol shorts just with different accounts. GA etc..
"After 6 months they finally make their move, just today they made their announcement. I expect a big jump. Let's see how the market re-act the next few days, not looking good the first 30 minutes ... Let's the game begin."

They mentioned they were in Vegas filming a commercial with Shaq. It doesn't matter how many stores you get into if people don't recognize your name. Get on with releasing the commercials so people can REQUEST your product from their neighborhood stores if they don't have it. Commercials create interest & interest creates 'word of mouth' advertising...which is better & costs nothing.

"Short squeeze tomorrow? I’m not sure if there are many shorts, likely not I would think."
"It looks to me like this has to move soon. Shaq and the management what I see are putting a lot of effort into promoting. Plus I keep thinking that with all the health concerns that people are waking up to the fact every detail helps, especially water from the right source."
WOW! A88 new infused water with the Vessl tech is awesome. The packaging is right on. Attaboy A88.
Looks like we are success at the trade show again this morning in Chicago. Huge large scale orders coming in
"WTER continues to do a great job of diluting our shares. Effective as of September 20, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 3,809,522 shares of our common stock upon exercise of our common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price of $1.25 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $4,761,902.50. We issued these shares to three non-U.S. person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) in an offshore transaction"
Water is my largest holding and I love that Shaq is on our team. I only hope he doesn't spread himself too thin and that we're able to have him on some online/tv commercials. I hope I'm doing my best to do my own promotional work by purchasing WTER products for my family and friends in an introductory manner and direct consumption in my home. I am also in the habit of asking any retailer I buy from who doesn't have our products on their shelf or menu for our products. These are small things but if repeated by hundreds of share holders it may have a material affect.
"I’ve been waiting for the dilution bottom to hit $1.50’s Now is the time to pick up shares. I bought 100,000 today. $2.50-3.00 by EOY"
"Hopefully they're seeing a lot of interest this week (Thurs, Fri & Sat) at the trade show! Maybe some new distributers & store sign-ups. Fingers crossed! Hopefully they'll out a PR next week letting us know how it went. Happy weekend all!"
There should be a shareholder vote coming soon.It's needed to approve another stock and warrant offering. The approval is required by 09/30/21 Vancouver Canada time.I've notified everyone on here before. However with all the excitement in the beautiful videos posted here I'm sure no one remembers.How does nonsense video help anyone understand this company ?
"Just released,SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alkaline Water Company Inc. (NASDAQ and CSE: WTER) (the “Company”), the country’s largest independent alkaline water company and The Clean Beverage Company, is pleased to announce that this year’s sales in the all-important C-Store channel have more than doubled over the previous year. The Company attributes much of this growth to partnerships with several new major Direct-Store-Delivery providers and additional placements in six new distribution centers of legacy partners.“Our C-store channel sales are beginning to grow significantly. Last month alone, we grew by almost 300% in c-store sales, making it by far our most successful month in the company’s history. This is before the full impact of any of our new DSDs or six new distribution centers has even been felt,” said Richard A. Wright, President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company. “The Alkaline88 footprint continues to expand with each new distribution center added to our nationwide network. Recent additions to our network of distributors include Nassau Candy, Cooper Booth Wholesale, Hensley Beverage Company, Nevada Beverage Company, and National Convenience Distributors. Combined with our legacy partners, our network’s access now gives us the potential to service approximately 50,000 of the 150,000 convenience stores across the country. Between our traditional channels and C-stores, our single-serves are now available to more customers than ever before. Many of our single-serve SKUs, including our aluminum bottle and many of our flavored-infused waters, are on pace to significantly outperform their sales from last year. The C-store channel is a leader in bottled water sales with over $4.5 billion in sales last year, according to Convenience Store News. While we continue to see significant growth in our traditional channels, we anticipate that the convenience channel will meaningfully contribute to our fiscal year 2022 sales revenues.”"
Nothing like giving back all our gains from last week in one day.

"10 Compelling Reasons to long WTER.1. The largest Shareholder is Shaq.2. State of the Art Technology that doesn't use Chemicals. Huge advantage over the competition.3. 89% compound annual growth rate over the past seven (7) years with no traditional advertising.4. Infused products will add revenue in 2022 by a substantial margin.5. #1 most efficient water company generating $2 million in revenue per employee; industry average is $220,000 per employee.6. Expansion into Mexico and Canada will generate massive revenue over the next three (3) years.7. Eight (8) Co-Packers strategically placed throughout the United States saves a significant amount in transportation costs.8. Prime Acquisition Target. Vitamin Water was purchased for $4.2 Billion. Alkaline88 is much more diversified that any and all recent acquisitions by Big Beverage. BodyArmor handed it's shareholders a 3,200% return. WTER market cap is a measly $169 million; this is laughable.9. WTER is fortunate enough to be part of a MEGA-TREND with consumers drinking less soda. This bodes extremely well for WTER.10. Food for thought. If WTER is bought for $3 Billion in a year or two, based on WTER's total outstanding 104.2 million shares, a $3 Billion acquisition price puts WTER at exactly $28.79 a share. If this number is cut in half, WTER will be acquired for $14.40 per share making the acquisition a measly $1.5 Billion. If WTER is purchased for the exact amount Vitamin Water was purchased for, the share price of WTER would be exactly $40.31. These are statistical facts; not opinion. WTER, the Best is Yet to Come. Buying and Holding WTER is a no brainer."

Hmmm!!See below."
Prediction today possibly we close at 1.70-1.75 depending how it goes at the NCAS show. We can get all the great news in the world but if we're not getting buying pressure it doesn't matter . So fingers crossed..
SHAQ PAQ 6 pack = a $6 stock

"Omni-channel advertising w/Shaq, broke into the club market, new CBD waters with the Vessl tech. Costco placement and PepsiCo buyout coming soon. Attaboy!"
"Based on all the warrants, etc exercised recently the company should have sufficient funds to operate for some time before having to raise any additional money.This company has operated on thin management ranks until recently. They have recently hired numerous people to fill out important positions for the exponential expansion that's expected.With the recently signed ABG-SHAQ agreement I suspect the sales expansion will be much better than expected.NOTE: I have recently had an opportunity to sample the product. IMO their water is very good. I have not tried any of the competitive companies products.However, I hate plain water. So, for me, to say I like their water is surprising. I never drink water without adding powder flavoring. As a matter of fact I purchased 5 gallon sized jugs: 2 from Wal-Mart and 3 from Food Lion."

However, there are risks with any investment and this company has a few. If you buy some shares and wait a few years this company will PROBABLY be a good investment for you.If you want another potential investment go to see my comments on Rave restaurant group (RAVE).More to come. Stay tuned."
So at the NACS show yesterday in Chicago apparently alkaline 88 did such a great job that several investors put in large-scale orders that is why the stock shot up so quickly. today they are presenting again at the show so we could perhaps see another huge bump up which would create momentum that we need.
"sometimes I catch myself being a little negative at this stock, well because if you've been in this for a long time like me there has been ups and downs and and a lot of disappointment. However I have to remind myself that those days are over and all the waiting is about to pay off. so I apologize if I came off negative about shaq's commercial I'm just excited as everybody but I also don't want everybody to get their hopes up if we don't skyrocket right away, and then get disappointed and sell. However time is definitely on our side, we have finally turned the corner and all the longs will be making alot of money very soon .. Poor Tam GA "
Silly early morning sellers.
"like I said Shaq has already and pretty much priced into the stock. That's why you don't see a huge movement today. The real meat and potatoes is in the Q3 and Q,4 reports.."
8.54 percent tutes and growing
OMG First it broke 1.68 then 1.55 then 1.50 now it broke 1.45... Where is Shaq? It is Oct too where is national marketing plan?
one thing is for sure Kevin is a shortie and is going to be crying when this thing goes 10x when it gets bought up by Coke or Pepsi and the next year. Good luck shorties You're going to burn bad on this one Shaq never loses on any stock and he is heavily invested in this one.
lol Notice shortie Kevin is no where to be found now

alkaline and Shaq hmmm load up
I'll say it again The stock was up to $2.25 less than 2 months ago without shaq's advertisement. Shaq is just going to be the cherry on top that pushes this over $3 and hopefully gets us a buyout very soon.Don't be a naive and think Coca-Cola has not been paying attention to all the work alkaline is done this last month. I guarantee they are going to want to buy out the number one independent alkaline water company for another company gets their hands on it. TRUST THE PROCESS HOLDING IS FREE
We need the big man shack on the TV promoting this company? Soon soon soon
Last chance to cover under $1.60?
Why rooting for Shaq when he is MIA? Also do read 8k to see why alkaline88 keep printing more shares to pay for Shaq causing the shareprice to decrease! Do we have anyone beside Larry reading the SEC filing?
Patience people. This could be $3.00 or more by summer 2022.
"Sam’s Club today, Wal Mart store shelves tomorrow, and then the World!"
Hold! $2+ coming soon!

"What concerns me... I live in aurora Indiana 50 miles west of cincinnati,oh. The krogers in lawrenceburg is out of the water more often than not. I like that their expanding but they have to keep their current customers stocked. Krogers wont hesitate to fill the shelves with their own products."
Mighty fine day building new base.
"I don't think we'll see any positive movement until, (1) Commercials with Shaq are released and (2) the financials are released in November. People need to see the numbers, positive numbers. I thought we would move upwards with the other day's news, loved the new bottle cap with flavorings idea! It's just a waiting game right now. Glta"
Beat down by shorts all day and bounce back like a champion.... You want to know why???
Large purchase made yesterday and today in early afternoon.
Making It Rain
Nice day. More to come.
SHAQ should get all the credit for today’s Sam’s Club addition. I bet he played a significant role. Thank you!
