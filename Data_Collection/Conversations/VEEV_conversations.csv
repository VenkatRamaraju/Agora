I am a reader of IBD and a stockholder of VEEV. In this weeks IBD I noticed that American Century Growth mutual fund(TWCGX) sold 130K shares of VEEV. Seems to me this was reason for stock dropping. (Profit Taking).Great company with great future.
"staying long, I like this company"
time to take profit and wait till she goes back to more reasonable $200 SP
BIG RALLY FOR VEEV INTO A STRONG QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORT AFTER HOURS TODAY!!!. GO VEEV GO!!!
"These 2 points are great, but only the beginning since it is clearly still caught in the crossfire. Give VEEV some more time, as we need to push through bands of resistance price points as the stock rises."
"I usually hate the timing when stocks like VEEV, CRM release earnings. this time around, it could catch the markets with a huge rip higher pending they crush their quarter which I feel they will do just that."
I made a video about Veeva Systems ($VEEV)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTSKZNDYeDoCRM for Healthcare. They bring Value to healthcare companies.
"“Veeva passed the billion-dollar annual revenue run rate milestone this quarter with a strong runway of growth ahead,” said CEO Peter Gassner. The important statememt here is ""with a STRONG RUNWAY for GROWTH""."
Great entry point for a long-term winner.
Best overall health company ever.. screen shot this for 6 months later
"Great company, great leadership, great products. Thus I am feeling as great as one can about this investment!"
I’m in 
Huge buying opportunity!!! A great company with a great earning and outlook. It has a very good profits as well. This is different from many other software companies that they are not profitable.
Adding in dips into 2021. I don’t trust we will have election results so if market dips this is one I am adding. Cloud ... healthcare ... here to stay. I would not be shocked if AMZN acquired Veev
Bought 900 at 148.4
"I believe the year-end tax selling and window-dressing has effectively ceased, and now the buying power for this oversold beauty will shortly take effect for this very profitable fast growing company and its true value will start to be reflected soon."
When will VEEV hit 300 again?
"Veeva is now taking market share from Medidata and Oracle, firing on 8 cylinders. Their clinical products are streamlined and they've been improving the products for clinical environments."
"VEEV seems to be doing better today than all of the other cloud stocks that don't have any actual earnings. Seems like our earnings, along with those of CRM, are helping with the valuation of the stock today."
"Short interest dropped exactly as predicted. Now stands, as of April 15, at 3.79% of float, or 1% less than the previous month when it stood at 4.8%. That is around 1M shares covered, giving some boost to the pps. Still a lot of gas in the tank with well over 3.5M shares still short. Vice is getting tighter shorties!"
very pleased with current price $175+ but 177 would put a lot of pressure on shorts if it holds and then move up to the next level. Now it's time to modify that stop loss...
"Can't wait for the ER in two weeks on the 27th. They are going to blow estimates out of the water, and I plan to hold my shares through the event. Remember the 1st quarter release, the stock skyrocketed the following morning! Their always report GAAP figures and actual profits growing in excess of 30%. Most other cloud companies report non-GAAP earnings and they are usually negative numbers, or a loss, as well. We should forge ahead nicely."
And....another client on board.... Astra Zeneca. Life sciences cloud
"Buying opportunity with this great earning, good outlook and growing company!!!"
"Earnings tomorrow after close. If it sells off, grab as many shares as you can and hold them forever."
Looks like some institutional investor accidentally pressed sell button instead of buy in after market.. LOL
"Some yellowbellied institution was selling shares all day. They'll be upset when it comes back up and exceeds its old high, esp after the next earnings report."
"I believe we've reached a bottom. Stellar earnings report but, like the start of a crowded marathon, working its way to break from the pack (ie. Salesforce and other cloud computing firms, macro forces). This should be back to $160 within next few weeks."
"Another up day in the market and VEEV ended in the red. There's a couple handfuls of tech stocks acting like this and it doesn't bode well if/when the next big red day occurs. If VEEV and the others can't go up on green days, I expect a deeper dive on red days. Could get interesting."
Not understanding this stock at all. I was hoping today was going to start entirely different. It’s going worse than Wednesday.
"VEEV has had a strong run. Traders sold VEEV today to buy beaten down tech stocks. Creates a buying opportunity prior to next week's earnings, which will be smashing."
"Huge bounce this morning since the open, getting back where the price belongs. No news, just a whale or two accumulating shares at market prices as they rise."
One more time rookies: BUY put options into every earnings report like I do and never work again ever in your entire lives
"I predict a good bounce this afternoon, this db downgrade is gibberish based on company guidance and the entire market will likely bounce some time after 1:00 or so. The pps needs to close above 143 soon to break that resistance point."
It is screaming at this price level after solid ER!Target $200!
This stock is holding up well compared to its cloud brothers - is it because it is health related?
WHY ISNT TH3 STOCK GOING UP BY 10%?!?!
Well now the gap is officially filled and the stock is free to move back up...
"It's funny, in Feb '20 (pre-covid) we were vacationing in San Diego, veev went to $165, (all time high, if my memory serves me) and I kicked myself that I didn't have any sell orders in. It plunged into the $120's, I decided to stay long and even added a little. $270's looks pretty good to me. Of course $300's would be better, but I think one year from now, I will be happy I stayed long."
"BOOM! the main thing is not only did they blow by earnings, they guided higher, which should propel the stock now."
"Keep covering shorts, the vice is tightening. We are less than 2 points away from a new all-time high. Great company!"
"My nonsensical and irrelevant race to 300 between VEEV and BABA is back in play. BABA with the decided edge, but VEEV is not giving up."
"""Buy Rating maintained by investment analysts at Morgan Stanley, who currently has a $123 target on firm"" from this week. They also own 10% of VEEV and Veeva is presenting at their conference tomorrow 2/27/2019."
Another drop of $50 per share and this stock may be worth a look.
Huge buying opportunity!!!
doe anyone know if veev is part of IBD leaderboard?
"Great day to average down...bought a block at $136.73 this AM, bringing my average down a couple of points. I would not sell this company, regardless of the knee-jerk reaction today to China."
It should be fine. 1) It is not related. to trade war. 2) It is a software SaaS company in life. science. Safe to keep amyway.
How many shorts will sleep well over the weekend/....
5/29/2020 SunTrust Banks Boost Price Target $167.00 ➝ $222.00
will this go back to 160's
"Everyone is so impatient these days. This is a good stock in a good industry, and there will be fluctuations, especially as year end is near. Sell if you must and move on. Personally I have sold good stocks too soon; I’m going to see what the new year brings for VEEV."
"IMHO seems to have reached an attractive further accumulation period. Added significantly to my long term position this am. Excellent analyst investor day with some strong reinforcing presentations. Note new Summits recently for India and China. China. Next week in Chicago for cosmetics, chemicals and consume package goods companies. Will attend to see first hand new customers"
hold this stock for 5 years and itll be trading at 500
Thanks giving sale if you didn't know.
"Their quarterly numbers look like a strong growth company. Has been in a correction for most of the year but I think that will bottom and we will see a breakout to new highs based on their solid performance. Only thing that could prevent that is if the rate of growth were to decline, but it looks like it is accelerating."
The stats indicate that the free cash flow is over 38% of the revenue. That's impressive.
Huge buying opportunity with this great earning and outlook company!!!
Split on the horizon....
"Last few wks have just been reforming the base, close to a 3wk tight. I’m no chart analysis pro but I think we’ll be in $350-$360 range by end of July and i purchased a ton of short term calls yesterday around that. Go VEEV!"
"I doubled down this morning at 158.50, and hope that the recovery continues through next week. My position is now too big of a percentage of my account that I am normally comfortable with, but I feel that this company's value is compelling and will be realized in the coming weeks."
ARKG is loading up today on VEEV. She sees the value given the share price decline. Long VEEV!
VEEV beats on their 3rd quarter earnings!!! Sales revenue is up 34 % and earnings are up 18%. VEEV will up-gap tomorrow morning!!! GO VEEV GO!!!
Beat on both profit and revenue
Technical analysis on $VEEV - https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VEEV/vgBFrGEA-Veeva-Systems-Beats-and-raises/
Will this stock see $200 before year end? One can hope right? This appears to be a short or simple profit taking for those that purchased in May and doubled. Good job to those people. Life Sciences are an important industry and Veev appears to have a niche that others have not ventured into yet. Can VEEV get to $200 before Googlle and Amazon enter the market?
You've been good to me VEEV Months ago bought 26 shares @ 149. Thanks VEEV
Many pharma advertising holding companies are bringing in leaders of their agencies to meet with Veeva to provide feedback and discuss opportunities during this time where explosive growth is occurring on their platforms. It's incredible to see a company like Veeva dedicate multiple resources to hear what all their clients/users want AND to improve their existing platforms. C'mon Novartis senior management. Get your act together and go back to using Veeva when your team is asking for it.
"@Robert, When I read it the first time, that's what I thought too. Then I read it again and it sound like the forecast is for the 2019 fiscal year ending Jan 31 2020. Confusing for sure but if that's the case this is a huge increase in forecast."
Comming back I owned this in the 50's and same thing would happen eventually I got shaken out . a bit higher but still out ..now I'm back in and not to be shaken out again ... look at the revenue these guys will bring in just leave it alone
We had some real analysts do a one upmanship to the report issued by Citron. Chalk up another loss for them. What were they basing their bearish opinion on?
Does anyone know what is going on in after hours trading? This is down big at this point..
"Another BIG upgrade today by Baird, with an outperform rating and a target of $184. We are running on rocket fuel!"
VEEV reached a new All Time High at 74.90
Excellent ER. Great Guidance for next quarter and for the full Year! Great company...
Options traders were expecting a +/- 7% move after earnings. Not a whole lot of movement in AH.
"Eddie -- Fundamentals put this company into a category of its own. They are developing new markets continuously while serving the life sciences industry, and there is very little direct competition."
Very good price action today so far - relative to the market and even its peers.
"OK, the after hour volume is small, so it must be some shorting traders trying to push it down. Tomorrow when the volume is large, they will not be able to suppress it down anymore."
"Such a great earning and outlook, $175 tomorrow is likely to break out."
"Hey honey, there's some guy on the phone named Margin? He says you need to deposit another $20 Million to cover a short thingy... Just tell em I'm not home and stop answering the phone!!"
"Just bought initial position @ 140 about 60k. Discovered this on OKTA board which I have owned since mid 20's. They have a lot of similarities. Fundamentals are very good, great industry, execs from salesforce, cloud based (the future). in addition looked back 5 years at the 50 day moving average, has bounced of that many times and provided good support.I also feel both stocks did really well this year ( cloud stocks in general) and have acted poorly at the end from profit taking and just valuation, good opportunity hopefully. Very smart people running this companyJust my thoughts"
"The CFO is retiring. This is not because there is any issue with the company, so the sp should not be affected. ""In the same press release, the company said Chief Financial Officer Tim Cabral is to retire next year after a decade with the company. A search for his replacement is underway, Veeva said, and Cabral will stay through the hiring and onboarding of the new CFO."""
"Aug 22 volume of shares shorted 96,817 someone really desperately wants to prevent VEEV from moving higher."
CRM knocked it out of the park again!! bodes well for VEEV. strong buy stock
"Both my girlfriends hit new highs and buy points today, two ladies I do not have to worry about,VEEV, NVDA"
Seems like an odd time for selling this. Their products are gaining market share at a rapid pace.
How come there is so little conversation about this stock compared to other stocks?
Buying opportunity!!! Take a look here: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-add-veeva-veev-131401713.html
CRM was up over 2% after earning even though it was a big down day - nasdaq was down 3%. SPLK and VMW both acquire a company. That's why they are down.
"I dont understand the constant selling. Fed gives us a gift that wasn't necessary imo, and we tank. market will figure it soon enough and this stock will be 170 before March expiration"
you don't get hurt if you don't jump off the Roller-coaster and if your Coaster is well built. VEEV has both qualities in abundance. if you know what you bought you should be loading up at these prices. #DEUTCHE BANK. they are bankrupt anyways. Thanks VEEV
"If you wanna sell a company with financials as strong as this one, please sell through 140-130-whatever. I will break my bank to buy this."
Earnings will be phenomenal. Huge growth down the road.
"Who would be selling today, after the price has declined by 10% in the last few days of panic? Surely, professionals know that out of all of the SaaS cos, this one is clearly worth a lot more. When their next quarter numbers are released, we'll all see the pps rocket upward again beyond old highs."
Morgan Stanley raised their target from 150 to 160.
Simply profit-taking the past few days.
The stock market is still headed for some pain as earnings season kicks off. Veeva will emerge as one of the stalwarts and leaders in cloud computing software. Headed to $200 by May.
Will be up big tomorrow!
"I'm researching this company for along time, didn't get the chance to jump in for some account losses, this is a gem that only grows, nice product, good management and profitable company, look no more, if it dips, I'm all in"
Between excellent recent R&D Conference in Philadelphia and October 4th Analyst Day update we agree that we can see $120 within six months.
What a powerful comeback!!!
"Veeva Sees Second Quarter Adjusted EPS 63c to 64cBy Linly Lin and Bloomberg Automation(Bloomberg) -- Veeva forecast adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 63c to 64c.• Sees 2Q revenue $339 million to $341 million• Sees FY adjusted EPS $2.50 to $2.55• Sees FY revenue $1.38 billion to $1.40 billion• 1Q adjusted EPS 66c vs. 50c y/y• 1Q adjusted gross margin 74.2%• 1Q adjusted operating margin 38.5%• 1Q revenue $337.1 million, +38% y/y• 1Q subscription rev. $270.2 million• 1Q R&D expenses $62.2 millionNOTE:"
"Sign InTECHNOLOGYThis IBD 50 Stock Just Crushed Second-Quarter Estimates; Shares PopALLISON GATLIN 4:17 PM ETVeeva Systems (VEEV) on Tuesday reported adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share on $266.9 million in sales for the second quarter ended July 31. In the year-earlier period, Veeva earnings were 39 cents a share on $209.6 million in sales. On average, analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected Veeva earnings of 49 cents per share and $259 million in sales.For the year, Veeva forecasted adjusted earnings of $2.11-$2.13 per share on $1.062 billion to $1.065 billion in sales. Analysts called for Veeva to earn $2.02 per share and to report $1.05 billion in sales."
"Current nasdaq sentiment is not going to reward any high-multiple tech/cloud stock that only 'nicely' beats estimates and outlook. VEEV is a keeper. Hang in there, longs. You will be rewarded, IMO."
New well respected CFO joins and Citi put out forecast of 30% upside and more progress in non-life science verticals. Maybe hits $250 target this year!
"Bought this way back in October 2015, 2100 shares at $24. It's been a great ride and it just keeps going. Thinking I may sell 450 shares which would get my original capital back, and let the remaining 1650 shares run. All in my ROTH so there are no tax consequences. Any flaws in my plan?"
Bought 4 more shares @ 144 adding to my position. Now at 25 shares. Thanks VEEV
"Yes thir! Cloud, Life Services, Pharmaceutical = $. Long way to run up amigos."
"Veeva is an industry leader. As long as the markets don't implode, it's headed to $200 by mid-year. Would like to see a stock split sometime within next few years."
VEEV REPORTS STRONG QUARTERLY EARNINGS REPORT!!! VEEV SALES UP 25 % OVER LAST YEAR and EARNINGS UP 75 % OVER LAST YEAR!!!STOCK PRICE IS UP 2 % AFTER HOURS!!!
"I finally got back in today at 276, that pullback was perfect for me and my timing was spot on. I've been out of this stock for too long, but it's a lot more expensive now than it was only around 9 months ago. At least I got a discount."
Crushed it again. And look at the forecast for next two years. Impressive!
"800,000 shares shorted in 5 days. Someone desperately want VEEV to take a dive."
So glad Cramer didn't like this stock 30 points ago.
May be some people are taking profits now after earning report. So load up more at suxh good opportunity for such a healthy growing company .
I'm hoping we'll see 110 in the coming weeks esp after ER.
I see someone is deleting my posts in praise on the fantastic ER we just witnessed. Hehe. Sorry Shorties. :))
What is going on here?
The traction that VAULT and NITRO products are getting away from pharma sector in industrial and consumer sector far exceeds the analysts estimates and will be major growth factors over the next 5 years. Look for positive new client success on the next qtr conference call.
"Stock price for VEEV is virtually unchanged since it first hit the current level at the end of May 2019. Well, that's about to change within the next few weeks. Earnings report will be stellar again."
Again. Know what you're buying. Time in the Market NOT Timing the market. If we stay around 142 I'm buying some more. I'll bet my Mortgage on this baby at this level. Thanks VEEV
if a POS like SLACK is worth more than $20B that means VEEV is worth $100B market cap
"Two years ago I learned about Veeva Systems. Knowing what I know about the company and how they operate, I'm not surprised by the surging share price."
Cathie bought $37M worth of this today in ARKG. Merry Xmas!
Not even at this price
I believe VEEV offered some of its products to new users until SEPT ... had 100 takers ... as part of the effort to tackle COVID-19. This is what scaling up in a SOFTWARE / CLOUD business can do.
Their ERs have a great track record. This is going to sky rocket very very very soon!!! Dec 1 AMC 0.68
Going green. $320+ here we come!
"Bought at 109, so hit the milestone today of closing at exactly double that. Sorry to brag...thanks for the returns, VEEV. The potential of 3 billion revenue by 2025 was an eye opener"
One of the long term stock. 2 X in 1 year time. 4X in 3 yr time.
"It's clear that the underlying stock is on an upward trajectory, but the periodic selling shoots it back down, undermining a strong upward move. After the new year, it should have more strength with less selling (no reason for it)."
Veev has a very good profits and growth. It should be a buying opportunity!!!
"Morgan stanley raises price target to 323. No dramatic post ER move, but these increased price targets rolling in should do the trick over the next couple/few weeks."
"Looks like we have liftoff!In 2020, it's looking more and more like the economy slows down and markets react accordingly. Unlike 2019 where the market as a whole was up greatly, 2020 will be about picking individual stocks. That's why VEEV will continue its run because of it's domination in cloud computing software for life sciences companies. Healthcare and biotech companies, along with their software suppliers like Veeva, appear to be positive plays in 2020."
"VEEV and BABA in a race to 300. BABA may win, but this post earnings action from VEEV is impressive!"
Please view this:https://finance.yahoo.com/video/veev-reverses-higher-142517793.html
VEEV ANNUAL GROWTH RATE IS OVER 82 %!!!
I love this company!
https://discord.gg/ATsbRVxW
Nice beat!
"Steady on boys. Don't get shook out and miss the opportunity, you'll regret it. We know what we have here. Think longer term than just today."
What a great buying opportunity !!
This is one of the best healthcare stocks right now as it combines the cloud with some of top life sciences companies for their products and services.
"In addition to Merrill and Keyblanc raised price target to $190, two more raises. Stifel analyst Tom Roderick maintains a Buy rating on Veeva with a price target lifted from $175 to $185.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Sandy Draper maintains at Buy, price target lifted from $150 to $180."
"On day like today, when so many stocks have been down all day, VEEV has held up nicely. This stock is a champ."
Pre market was $7 up so this one is closing green good volume
"wow, the tune on here has changed. If you think the results were good buy some more, its simple. Sell high"
VEEV will likely explode higher tomorrow after earnings as stock looks to be in cup with handle with a double bottom formation.
https://discord.gg/XfpePtHn
VEEV broke back through the 200-day moving average on December 26 and has been very strong since.
today is a good day to load VEEV into your portfolio folks. this stock will trade at rock solid support this am. hasn't dropped thru this entire economic rout of equities and is a strong buy imo
"When they eventually turn off the high speed computers running algos, all of the cloud-based stocks will rebound fairly quickly. These short attacks should be subject to the uptick rule, which they conveniently had removed so they could absolutely pummel any stock or group that they want. Turn off those HS computers already. The uptick rule had been put into place to avoid situations such as this, where stocks go straight down for no reason other than high speed computers selling shares short, in order to make it appear as it is profit taking. No such luck, 12 stocks don't go straight down over 5% first thing on Monday morning, and the rest of the market is fine."
"Can we form a base in this area? I'd like to get back in but not with this type of behavior, we need a base from which to break out from. Great company earning strong GAAP profit, growing in the 20% range for both revenue and earnings."
Is it over $400 yet like every post I read?

SP increase as CC progressing.The factors that impesses me are;Long decision lead time for life sciences companies provides barriers to entry for Veeva competitors Recent remote working by life sciences professionals is driving the market for Veeva.I'm very confident that the SP will continue its upward trend - tomorrow will be a great day. GLTA
not what I expected after good earnings but thank for letting me buy some cheaper shares
"Jumped in at 77.09, let’s see those earnings and new highs!"
Short volume has drastically decreased in the last few days by more than half after walking it down from 170. Now only if the market can remain in the green for a few days we may see some upside.
it will be up 10% tomorrow

"With such a good earning and growing company, there is nothing to be worry about. The important is that VEEV has a very good profit, not like wday, now, okta, etc."
"This is not a ""work from home"" type of tech stock. This drop is way overdone and presents an excellent op to average down at a good price."
"Thank you for the opportunity to buy a software company with this much growth on the top and bottom line, and with price targets raised today by well respected analysts. I'm long VEEV in premarket."
"We are going up today, with a buy rating and price target raise to $175 from $155 from Stifel Nicolaus this morning, and on the heels of strong earnings from CRM. I'd like to see this back around $170 on Tuesday when the ER is due."
"I admit to knowing little about VEEVA but I think this: They seem to be a ‘digital’ company that can scale up from home easily. And they have no debt. And when COVID happened, they opened their services to non-users free until SEPT .., had about 100 takers. Should have a few adopters then. Finally, I think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions in many industries given today’s circumstances .,, speaking the same language via VEEVA should help."
"VEEV, kinda scary that it didn’t hold 167 again, and is down decently today. Hopefully it bounces back Monday and can break through 200 to all time highs after earnings!"
"Good long term hold, if it’s keeps dropping will need to buy more."
"overdone to the upside today, over 5% on light volume. Mostly 100-200 share trades all the hallmarks of MM manipulation !!"

Veeva forecasting >$1B in revenues in FY'20. How many companies provide guidance for an entire year? They are laser focused on achieving the $1B mark.
"For those who feel more comfortable with low PE, they should buy MU. Rapidly growth companies tend to have high PE. It is just a reflection of strong demand versus supply. Don't worry about high PE when the companiesnis healthy and have strong growth like VEEV in this case."
Bought 800 at 149.4
Why down in after market even after beating estimates and forecasts?
VEEV’s CEO is on Cramer’s show on CNBC this evening.
Nice run today. We need to hold this level and higher as the days progress.
"I'm listening to the call, positive. 3 billion in revenues in 2025 is doable, said the ceo. TP 500-700"
"Why has this stock been getting hammered most every day? They had a great ER, and the future is very bright for them. I won't sell even though I'm now sitting on a loss. I know this company is strong and in time will be well over 150 easily -- they deliver strong growth in revenue and GAAP Earnings every quarter."
"Funny that VEEV could not get out of its own way in the 140 range for a long time, now a month or two later it jumps up in leaps and bounds when nothing has changed, it has always had a great story of growth and potential."
This is a great company. I just got in as a virus/cloud play anticipating good earnings. For once I made a good trade. Very solid story here. Going to park for a while.
"Excellent earnings. No reason to be selling this way. May have something to do with the treatment Zoom (ZM) got. In reality, VEEV is where the growth is and it continues to prove it with every passing quarter."
uh oh. Down 4.5% alreadt AH and earnings numbers arent widely available yet....under 300 here we come
amazing earnings. looks like we are headed to 120 and beyond.
"This is the type of action I was referring to last week. Just when things start looking good, they hammer it down like a pile driver. No rhyme nor reason but I'm glad I protected what little profit I had left."
who is selling everyday at open time?

Bought 1200 at 149
stock has held up beautifully.
"If you are looking for a long-term investment that is going to beat the overall market year-to-year, VEEV is a great place to invest. In five years I expect this company's market cap to be around $250B."
I've never been this happy on a CLOUDY day. All my Cloud stocks- ADBE. TYL. CRM. VEEV. are up. Thanks VEEV

"Great report by VEEV this afternoon, solid growth. If market stabilizes, we should see new highs soon."
I'm glad I've got other clouds like TYL. ADBE. CRM. holding up the cloudy sector of my portfolio. Nevertheless I'm still bullish o b VEEV. Patience is a Virtue. Thanks VEEV
180.00 - blow out. Wish i was a player in this.
Buying Opportunity !!!!!
"Happy with results. - given shr price history at/after earnings, tech performance overall today, I like what I'm seein'."
just bought 12 Shares @ 142 Thanks VEEV
VEEV is on its way to a $100B market cap. Perhaps within 2 years. That means a doubling in price in 2022.
"Nice big upgrade today by Piper Sandler, with the price target raised to $188."
"I really, really like this company. Any possibility of a buy out? Future growth, revenue extreme."
Tomorrow this will go up to $380+
"As I said earlier, this is following the last year trend, it will come back after next result .. sometimes after Feb 20. I am going to hold."
WOW!!! Look at VEEV rally!!! GO VEEV GO!!!
"Around 3/3, it will jump up to $200"
Expecting $122 after result

Probably also some insiders with low cost stock and trading window available to sell with current cap gains taxes vs waiting for Biden increase next year?
"Niche in the industry. Over 90% of shares held by institutions, double in value in the last two years, I see this hitting $200 once the awakening happens - my guess it will be before the end of the year. These guys will grow and be profitable until Google or Amazon decide they want a piece of the action. Shorts will have fun scaring the stock down along the way, but come $200 that will be a nice pay day!"

"reaches 100, i have been watching this stock since its IPO, looks like it rides up 10-15$ every earnings, long term holding for next 10 years should give a 500% return minimum.Great company and strong management."
"I've been awaiting a day like today for a strong 5-point run, it was just a matter of time, and there is more to come once we consolidate today's gain, or we may simply continue up tomorrow. Later today it'll probably get hit for a piece of today's gain."
"Upcoming earnings are going to be very strong. Market reactions always unpredictable as macro forces caninfluence the overall markets, like today. However, VEEV is a great long-term investment."
I’ve been in the market for 40 years and I can’t remember this kind of movement.
I'm finally in the green. 149 average price. Hopefully it's up from here on out My portfolio is concentrated on VEEV Thanks VEEV
know what you're buying Investors think long Speculators think short. I'm loading up again if we fall below 140 Thanks VEEV
This is a great growing company with very high ranking. We could see break out tomorrow with such a good earning report!!!
Green today.
Not exactly Andrew Lefts most successful shorts.
"Same thing happened last quarter when they reported great earnings and growth. There has been something fishy going on. Their competitor, who they are suing for trying to monopolize the market, IQV, is up today by 3 or so points, and Veeva is flat?"
"buying op, they help the very drug companies that are making this vaccine & others, end of year tax move & profit taking. Earnings Dec 1st. Long term = gold mine."
If it’s good enough for IBD it’s good enough for me.Bought 6000 shares this morning.
Cloud stocks on sale today! Time to nibble?
"awesome, this stock will crush it today with Earnings"
"I expect the short interest to be 1% less on April 15, or around 3.8% of the float. The remaining shorts have a tightening vice on their testees."
"It would almost be weird these days, if a good earnings report for any company not named Tesla resulted in an after hours gain. As a long term holder, I'm very happy to see this company continue to excell. Hopefully we'll cross that 300 barrier again in the next couple of weeks, and stay above it this time."
"At 72 p/e and a 51 forward p/e this going north in any significant way until earnings, Feb 24, Synethetically long, short Jan-17 135 strike puts. This is not a cheap stock. It's also had an incredible 12 month run and has outpaced it's prime competitor in the space, CERN. Patience is required here. Maybe sell OTM calls. G.L."

Sneak Peak at new innovations at today's VEEVA R&D Summit:https://www.veeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/RD-Summit-Infographic_v5.pdf
Outstanding CEO/ Founder. No limit to what they can do. Love their principles. Take a look at their website. They disavow noncompetes. Great culture customer focused.
gonna test 300 today
let's root for a good call
"This is an excellent cloud stock, with strong actual GAAP earnings. I don't care about the PE, that level is warranted at the rate of the company's growth. This should be back to 175 by year's end if the market holds up. Tuesday was a gift to buyers following the earnings report that exceeded estimates for revenue AND earnings. I have no idea who was selling so hard, what did they expect from the report???"
"The JP Morgan conference is tomorrow, Thursday, 1/16. I think today is a breather before some serious upside following tomorrow's conf."
"PBC CONVERSION REASONSOne analyst explained:Veeva announced plans to potentially convert their corporatestructure from a C-corp to a public benefit corporation (PBC). In the context ofVEEV stock today, we do not see this conversion changing the way the companyoperates or how they pursue the stated long term goals through 2025 andbeyond. Bigger picture, we see three potential benefits: 1) VEEV stock ownership could expand more broadly into ESG funds investing along these themes;2) As pharma companies’ spend on Veeva increases, this change could better align theholistic purpose of Veeva with their customers, to improve human life;3) Amidstthe increasing hunt for talent, Veeva could attract more employees aiming toparticipate in a mission-driven company. In the context of governance, we alsosee Veeva’s commitment to declassify its board of directors and implementmajority voting as shareholder friendly change"
"Looks like they're trying to fill the gap from 162 up to 163.50. I never understood the necessity for gap filling, but it is a real thing. Once filled, it'll take off again."
Much better reaction then AH last night !!! REAL NICE !!!
Buying opportunity!!!
"Yes, volatile; buy more. Long term investor in at $130s and adding. It is about innovation,"
"I hope that Salesforce (CRM) delivers very strong earnings this afternoon, it could be a catalyst to help Veeva recover some recent decline after their stellar quarterly report."
Earnings should be strong again. Doesn't mean that price will increase significantly due to market fears from coronavirus. Great time to buy at these levels for longer term gains.
Veev has set up a flat base and is in retention for a big move north. Volume has dried up which sets up for institutional buying. The company has a great business model and continues to look outside the box. The company has no debt and earnings continue to outperform buy point at 59.80 Target 67. High target 70 Telling it like it is good luck for now. Happy hunting JD
"Veeva is the first mover in providing CRM services specifically designed for pharma companies, a niche market but extremely profitable and sticky in nature. They're also on the verge of becoming the first true multivertical SaaS company, as stated by Barron's back in December. The growth trajectory has been terrific foe VEEV, but once they truly breakout from their pharma focus, there's no telling how far this stock can rise. This is very similar to Salesforce (CRM) 5 years ago. Pricey today? Absolutely, yes it is. The great growth companies always are though, so I'd suggest averaging in to your desired position over the next 12-24 months taking any market swings out of the equation. Could miss out on some upside, but limits downside risk as well. Best of luck VEEV longs..."
What’s holding this back other then the high valuation? A lot of the high growth cloud names recovered from the rotation that took them down but VEEV has stayed in neutral even though it generates a profit. Thoughts welcome . TIA
"Looks like our earnings may knock it out of the park. Up strong for 3 days in a row, and only a few hours until the ER. We went from 86 on Monday to around 90 today. Today is so far our smallest gain at only 1%, but what will the ER reveal. Hope it's a grand slam and we move easily into the 90s tomorrow."
"December 10th article in Barron's stated... ""Thinking longer-term, investors have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward Veeva’s move to become probably the first true multivertical SaaS company.""This might not seem like a big deal on the surface, but I see being ""multivertical"" as meaning it has twice the opportunities for growth. Still trading at a lofty multiple, but my guess is they'll grow into the multiple and well beyond. VEEV is in the sweet spot of SaaS and is just getting started. I have a 30% position now and how to add at lower prices. Best of luck VEEV longs..."
Open over the 52 week high?
"over 1.1 million shares shorted in 2 days. explains the dip. desperately trying to cause a sell off panic, but they will have to recover that short position and when they do... watch out for the upside explosion. should be interesting."
apparently VEEV has a prolific group of panic sellers with no concept of holding until the stock can rebound.
I feel strongly that VEEV will hit $400 by end of year.
We held really strong into the close today. They tried for 1-1/2 hrs to pull it down but it just kept moving right back up. Bodes well for tomorrow and onward.
"Merrill and Keybanc raise targets to $190. Major new VEEV summit i Chicago Oct 8 will focus on solutions in three new vertical markets of cosmetics, consumer products and chemicals. Some impressive speakers, examples and 10s of prospects attending in our home town.Definitely will attend"
"Did not think today would be the day for a nice move, I’ve been buying this dip merry Christmas  VEEV "
"who sold to me at $299,60 last night I appreciate you very much"
I just bought another 100 shares of VEEV. I am expecting VEEV to post blowout earnings after hours today!!! GO VEEV GO!!!
A lot of analysts put out significant price target hikes on this. This should turn back up once the nervous nellies finish their selling.
"Bam, the Citron report is already history. I hope they lost their shirts. Veeva is moving upward again and will regain its footing soon."
Profit taking today. Does not take away from the long-term share price increasing in the coming months. Keep in mind that holding VEEV doesn't mean it should be sold off. It just means that there may be other opportunities out there for stocks that have sold off recently and are a better buy than VEEV. I'm not selling until Veeva says they are not on track to reach $3B revenue by 2025.
Remember when people thought this was worthless at $40 a few years ago?
"Nice rebound today, although the sellers arrived around 11:00 and are driving it back somewhat. We should be over 150 at least."
"Crazy market. If you think life sciences/healthcare will be a strong sector and cloud platforms, this is a great place to park your lettuce."
Time to add more 
Buying opportunities
"Veeva guided for full-year fiscal 2020 revenue between $1.062 billion and $1.065 billion, and adjusted EPS between $2.11 and $2.13The consensus estimates are $2.05 on revenue of $1.05. So it is a beat in guidence, too."
"just bought 30 shares, looking for a nice 15-20% gain in the upcomming weeks"
"I’m guessing that the combination of the lower trading volume (less liquidity) and the fact that this stock has such a high institutional holding and interest, makes it more susceptible to low volume erratic fluctuations as the market maker needs to bring in stock to fill those institutional orders. There were some large block trades (125k shares plus) that hit the tape in the close the last few trading days. This isn’t retail shares changing hands."
95$++ easy tomorrow!!
I knew it will go up.... so beautiful earning...

"Another big short attack today on VEEV along with the other cloud cos. With VEEV they are shaking the tree to get shares cheap, I suggest not selling and holding through the hurricane. We'll be back up in short order."
"I cant find anything specific about why VEEV is down today other than the entire COVID cloud play is getting hammered. The idea of a fed raising rates is seen as negative for hyper growth companies like VEEV. Shorts are piling in the sector for the inevitability of a fed interest rate hike. Ultimately, it'll blow up in their face. this is where the growth will be in the next 5-10 years."
VEEV always under the radar. Never hyped yet it crushes year after year.
