One of the long term stock. 2 X in 1 year time. 4X in 3 yr time.
Looks like some institutional investor accidentally pressed sell button instead of buy in after market.. LOL
Remember when people thought this was worthless at $40 a few years ago?
Going green. $320+ here we come!
Why did Director Matthew Wallach sell 3 mill $ of stock within the last month???

One more time rookies: BUY put options into every earnings report like I do and never work again ever in your entire lives
Why doesn't Veeva do the Palantir model and make an equity investment into a bunch of biotech start ups in exchange for them using their software
"who sold to me at $299,60 last night I appreciate you very much"
Headed back to $330 by Thanksgiving. New all-time highs by end of year. Veeva crushes earnings each time and it's a leader in life sciences software.
Down on earning beat and raised guidance upgraded to 336to385stock down 23 pointslove it...longs got hosed...lol
Gonna see close $316+ today. Tomorrow $325+
$274 to $325 in less than 3 weeks. Pretty impressive run. More to come.
Why has Veev gotten hit today?
Tomorrow this will go up to $380+
Beat on both profit and revenue
"Excellent earnings. No reason to be selling this way. May have something to do with the treatment Zoom (ZM) got. In reality, VEEV is where the growth is and it continues to prove it with every passing quarter."
I am a reader of IBD and a stockholder of VEEV. In this weeks IBD I noticed that American Century Growth mutual fund(TWCGX) sold 130K shares of VEEV. Seems to me this was reason for stock dropping. (Profit Taking).Great company with great future.
If you look for real growth in a slow growth environment 》invest in VEEV ;)
