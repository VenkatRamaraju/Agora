Lets just hope that earnings dont cause a selloff... In the real world KMI was the first report the large 1X gain from the TX storm back in Q1... they reduced debt by $1.4 Billion....And the stock tanked.... they were wonderful results... and whomever was selling them as horrible....
Time for KMI to be buying shares!
"I’m thinking 20 after earnings, if the winter is as cold as they say it’s going to be 21 by spring!!!"
Been in KMI for several years.Love those dividends ! Stock is looking to go higher
"First Buffett enters the natural gas pipeline space, now Carl Icahn. Up we go!"
"@Al: thanks for your response to my post, yesterday. If folks want to make money trading, fine. I’m a long term holder, and am doing well when you include the dividends. I’m sticking with it. I have admitted before, more than just once, that I could have done better, elsewhere. This equity sure beats t-bills and money market rates. I’ll take the risk to get a little more. Thanks again for your post."
KMI gives ESGs a more politically correct way to latch onto the energy boom. Buy.
Dutch TTP is 7 times Henry Hub
Omg I just bought in today. Thats some Nancy Palosi level market timing there for me!!!
"KMI following oil down here. Part taper talk from Fed, part Covid- Delta strain putting the kabosh on the recovery from the anti-vax crowd. No logic to be found. Good news is: Yield is up and price is down. Natty gas will still keep the lights on and the A/Cs running."
"Jim Cramer says ‘I’m calling the top right here for oil’https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/jim-cramer-says-im...Jul 15, 2021 · Oil prices have peaked, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer. ... One of the hottest trades of the year is over, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer. NEXT PRO TALK. …Author: Pippa StevensHe now says COP robbed RDS... last year he ripped the oil industry as evil and worthless with stranded assets... who can take him seriously? just a TV money manager, I not buying his facade"
"Don’t look now, folks....Zacks has bumped kmi up to rank #2, ‘buy.’"
Whooooo Hoooooo $$$$$$$
Wanna see how to get KMI below $17.... $17 seems to be holding as support rather well
"Starting to feel like KW disease may be effecting KMI shareholders. For those who don’t know, KW disease is a serious illness that affects ET unit holders and has aggressive symptoms similar to what occurs 10 minutes after eating a spicy 3-piece from Church’s Chicken"
Its only a matter of time before the midstreams start benefitting from the increase in energy prices.
"My expectation is that KMI will break $20/sh when we get some sort of winter superstorm. We all know something is brewing that will cause the US gas infrastructure to be bottlenecked, causing spot prices to skyrocket. We all know that states have been quick to retire coal power and shifted to natural gas. Investments in solar/wind doesn't do anything when you have a massive winter storm icing up turbines and covering solar panels."
KMI should be priced at under 5% vs. 6.2% imo. The street is still hearing footsteps from years ago and isn't paying attention to KMI's return to growth evidenced by its recent acquisitions. Buy.
Looks like you might get your order filled at the open Mr. Wiselama.
Al.... the board had KMI at a consensus buy at $15.50... you mocked it.. you missed out on 7+% in two days....Great call...
Good thing this pays a dividend otherwise there would be no reason to hold it. Still should be back over $20. Must be in an unloved index or something that I don't understand.
Headed back to $17
"Lots of short term traders seem to be getting out so maybe a positive for the stock. If one is holding long term for the divs, great time to add this week -- nibbled a bit late afternoon with some excess divs accumulated in Roth and HSA. I don't see energy dropping anywhere near as low as last year since there won't likely be the widespread closures/lockdown this time around."
Crossed over on chart 16.50+ close then onto 18-19
Are they merging with a company? $EXPI maybe?
Natgas use OFF the Charts! Huge gain for KMI recent storage acquisition
"Down on volume, carefully watch KMI’s cap ex budget."
What's with the spike in after hrs. price? Anyone with any insight?
When is ex dividend day ? Asking 4 a friend
"KMI always seems to fully participate to the downside but not the big up days -- for comparison, EPD was up 6% over the last two days but is down today less than KMI (which did not go up at all the last couple of days). Certainly some curious price action in KMI of late......"
"Ummm, natural gas is up 9% today, yes just one day."
Will never buy a KMI call again .. 16.50 they teased and teased them …. I’m out on the KMI calls now for good !
RNG pending permits?Another long battle situation ?
What a beautiful dividend 
NG 5.22 mmbtu and this mutt just sits at $16
"I love this stock, it will go up as soon as winter sets in!!"
"Gil,"
Where's the guy who sold at 15.70 because he got emotional?
"I guess KMI selloff yesterday before close is mist more option expiration manipulation by the large instit. A shame I thought since KMI is such a strong stable company they woudnt mess with it . For option purposes, I guess no stock is safe from the manipulation surrounding options. Was a clear breakout this week , or maybe they made it seem that way to sell then steal call premiums ."
They had some interesting insights about KMI on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Did someone send out a memo that KMI has THE LARGEST NG PIPELINE SYSTEM in the USSeriously... that has to be worth something at this time
What a beautiful long term dividend hold!
"Don’t buy KMI calls people , if you like it ONLY buy the shares . They will only steal your money , time after time"
"I was big into COP for the dividend but in 2014 they cut it by 2/3....2/3...2/3...I also hold WDC, the dividend appeared and disappeared in a three year period...Don't count on dividends when revenues are tanking year after year."
"Hey Wiseone....I hope your GTC order at 15.50 gets filled. If you lower it, I get it as I have been short the SP500 for the last 3 weeks and sold off all my non energy related stocks. I should be able to get more of these on the cheap and hold for 5+ years."

I am all in as of the lasts 4 days. .....
"Up 41 cents,,,,,,,,"
"The q1 billion gain, pay down of debt, increased dividend, the 25% increase in NG, ...The $16 share price makes no sense"
With Nat gas at $4.70 what is the hold up? Prices going down crashed the stock but prices going up don't raise it?Revenue will increase.
Still one of the worst holdings I have. Once they dissolved KMP I should have sold. Keeps going lower & lower.
if kinder keeps buying back shares....could this ever hit $40 again.....???
"I sold 10k shares about a 5 weeks ago at this same price. Unfortunately I sold the remaining 5k for 16.48 during beginning of the ""fake"" market correction. Should have bought back with the Wise one for 15.50. Oh well, good luck guys!"
Coco... now thats a funny GIF
"Not too many stocks go up, only in the trading range, this bull market is a hoax,"
Any one else wondering why KMI can’t get above $17 and keep going?
Hold on
"With the price of Natty well over 5 clams, KMI should jack costs to move products across their lines. You cant let the producers lick all the cream."
Up on volume. Another thing mr negative has wrong.
Solid $15 stock.Sell covered calls.Dividend growth single Digits. Stock could sell at 20 on a takeover.
Still weighing my options on exiting this position. Love the dividend but do not want to be holding if the Covid situation facilitates a 10% correction. If the market drops 10% do you think KMI will follow or will the dividend keep it from following the market all the way down?
Natural gas king KMI now breaking out. Buy all you want below $20.
"oke way upkmi idles, 1.08 was an anchor.kmi getting it to move would be like nixon trying to re-elected. rk=nixon"
"Did KMI firm up ER date, it shows tentative 10/19 on anything I am reading? Energy looks to be a good place to invest as oil prices are at 7 year highs......anyone else think $20 soon?"
Here is the Max Pain reality... when I checked yesterday... the KMI pain point was $16... and the ET pain point was $9...A sihtload of positions have closed in both...And it appears that both will close... close to yesterdays pain point...Both of those tickers moved towards the pain point late yesterday... and danced around it today
Motley Fool must have received a gift basket from Mr Kinder. Several recent articles from them in the past 10 days or so.
Natural gas prices are at $5.10 per BTU. This means producers will be producing and transporters will be transporting a lot of natural gas. Not to mention the storage that will need to be filled up between now and the start of winter. $15.50 is a great price to add KMI.
it's the kmi two-step. it's one step up and two steps back. okay i think you got it.
Kmi needs to raise dividends
almost every stock has low volume today.Apathy has set in
"Small acquisitions will be the only action from KMI in the next couple of years, no new-build large projects. No Canadian slop, LNG will be strong, NatGas will have a solid future as electricity takes over fossils (next 20 yrs). Oil has reached high tide. Water will be the next commodity piped to redistribute to drought zones. KMI will lead the way. It ain't political, its the future. Even Big Oil is reading the tea leaves. KMI will never breach $20 without a new catalyst. It is a pure dividend play. Doubtful any buyout happens in next few years, unless it gets a lot cheaper."
"Everyone knows energy stocks are going to head higher. Kmi will go up a little more slowly, but I’m hanging on. Over the long term, the dividends will keep being paid. With share appreciation, we’ll all do fine, despite the setbacks of the last few years. Bullish."
"There is a lot of momentum building here and earnings will be announced in less than two weeks. After a dozen of so ho-hum earnings releases, KMI needs to show something really positive. Perhaps a suprise dividend increase or Richard's death would help."
"Between the Arizona pipeline issues, oil and gas down and general market correction vs fed tapering, adding at 15.80 for a long hold in the Roth for the div looking like a good bargain."
My buy price of $16.21 definitely gonna hit today!
"I know it was 1 day before ex dividend but I sold 5000 shares at 17.98 today. It was just too large of a position and am left with 10,000 shares which is a much better fit. Plus I made some good money!"
Last week KMI price crossed 200 week and 21 week moving averages. A very bullish LT sign.

Rich Kinder just needs to take it private for $20 and put us stockholders out of our misery.
"When energy prices went down many oil and gas stocks went down a lot, now the energy prices have gone up double and stocks seem don't go up at all, this market is a scam"
Oh and Pete they bought back debt because they hit an iceberg named Junk Status as their CFO sat silent. But it paid off nicely as she got promoted for doing so.Pete makes it sound like they took profits and paid down debt cuz they are smart.In truth RK went on Mad Money and pushed something he couldn’t deliver on and didn’t admit it until he cut the div 75%+
Everything you sell I buy. I rather holding KMI instead of Paper USD
I'm out...

Can someone get Rich Kinder on the horn and tell him we capitulate and buy us out for $20
"Certainly $19 before end of year, possibly $20 but likely by Feb/ Mar. Any price gains after that will be short lived, but $20 should hold barring negative events."
I have a 5k share GTC @ $15.50 in for months... since the Q1 EPS...Im hoping it fills...
what is going on with the Dividend? When is KMI going to pay it. Shouldn't they have paid it in August?
Nice Seeking Alpha article out today by HFIR on Cheniere (LNG).......not interested in the company but like what the article says about the booming LNG market......

Does anyone know if KMI has started pumping oil from its small holding?
"On a roadtrip that had me driving through Iowa listening to the am radio stations, its amusing how obsessed they are with their ethanol sacred cow. It seems old joe and the Democrats with their push for electric vehicles pose a serious threat to their racket. If they can manage to kill off ethanol before they destroy the rest of the economy the greenies will have accomplished one good thing."
Whole oil patch is up.KMI just rising with the tide...
Consistently buying shares?Pete?Bought back their debt with YOUR promised dividend.For Pete’s sake!6% dividend. Hmmmm….for longs how does that .27 look vs .51 when RK promised 10% a year from his toll road that is I effected by oil prices?
When will I get this under $17

We need to disconnect from the price of oil as KMI profit is not impacted by oil price.

"In the last 12 months KMI insiders have sold 678,251 shares and bought 56,890. RK has made no buys in the last 12 months."
Glad I sold at 16.96 and 16.46. Still hold OKE and WMB and beginning to think OKE may be best of breed. Will still consider adding KMI back in the 14-15 range. GL!
time to sell?
I consider KMI a very solid holding. There is a great future ahead for this company.

During the big freeze in Texas last winter KMI recorded large one time gains due to the spike in natgas prices. Current gas prices are up quite a bit. Why won't KMI have a similar opportunity for gains?
KMI down -16% since mid June when it was a tad above $19. I’d say another buying opportunity is drawing near.
awesome stock :-)

Can someone check on Al? Make sure he's doing OK today.He's probably alternately engrossed in Thomas Paine readings and sticking needles in his Rich Kinder doll.
why over a million shares in premarket?
"Just sold out of my XOM to buy KMI today. KMI pays a bigger dividend, which is easily covered by free cash flow, unlike XOM, and unlike XOM KMI has a natural gas and alternative energy business which are likely to do much better under green legislation than big oil will. Not to mention, KMI is actually historically cheap right now in term of valuation."

Anyone see the $16.50 pre market trade... what was up wit dat?
"Relatively low(er) risk buy here at 16.00 imo. It's just that if overall markets tank, then everything gets a haircut. Good place to scale in or maybe add."
$15.50 who’s addin’ ?
I sure hope the Stagecoach 41BCF of natural gas storage is going to work out this Winter. Hopefully they don't have it tied to a 100% hedged contract with Consolidated Edison. If they don't then it is going to be a great year for KMI along with everything else tied to NG.
OH COME ON FOR CH$%&ST SAKES............so tired holding this for years and go nowhere.
"down again , imagine that"
"Guess who?A prime example of our thinking is our gradual increase in the dividends we pay our shareholders. I’ll remind you, we've gone from $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018 to $1 in 2019, and as promised, intend to pay $1.25 for 2020, and all of those dividends have been amply covered by our cash flow."
"It is true that this company is doing a great job.Following the price action, a double bottom appears to be forming in the zone between $ 16.90 and $ 17. If not, and continue to decline, it could reach the $ 16.2o area. There it must coincide with the 38% of Fibonasci and with the ascending Mobil Average of 200 periods that must act as strong support.I believe that where they are at the moment they should no longer be sold. For me it is already in the shopping area. I would divide my capital into 3 or 4 parts to make several purchases. If it falls more, then I buy more.This is just a comment. Everyone must do their own analysis."
Fast Money panel loving KMI. Najarian says it s/b where it was 7 years ago.
"NEW position in KMI today....$16 presents reliable support, see 1/2021 to 3/2021.So pulled back to previous base, held support at 200 day moving average.In most recent 13F filing, from 8/26 for Q2 largest shareholders increased positions. KMI now having bullish reversal off 200 day. Energy stocks, after healthy pullback poised to regain footing. with strong EPS, cash flow and sales bolstered by pinch on supplies. KMI also in the top 3 % of dividend paying stocks in S&P 500"
So with NG storage probably going to be at dangerously low levels come this winter... and production lagging here at the end of summer... with not all that mich time for production and overall storage to recover...Who thinks that North East storage for NYC and environs they recently bought will be a winner come January and February?
So what happened with all that blather about KMI getting bought out?KMI will do what RK says it will do.He called me the other night.He ain't selling. Yet.Just take the loot.
A move above the one-year closing high of $19.14 going into earnings next week would be a pleasant surprise.

Word must be out on block buster earnings
Really under $16
Beautiful dividend play
"Someone please correct my understanding, which is that KMI's share price is largely contingent on sheer volume of natural gas delivered, which in turn relies on forward demand for natural gas and the ability of suppliers to increase production. In other words, price of NG is only relevant to the extent that higher price = lower demand, thereby hurting KMI's earnings and share price. Then again, lower price of NG = lower production, which will decrease KMI's revenues. Based on this, what is the ideal macroeconomic scenario that long investors want to see for KMI to be successful?"
"prices up, prices down, Afghanistan collapsing, Covid rising, global warming, floods, fires, famines. However tomorrow the dividend goes into my account so I will tune it all out! Amazing what a few bottles of scotch and gin in the cabinet can do for one's mental health!Stay safe fellow longs!"
I think we will see KMI at $20 next year as the dollar drops.
pretty sure KMI going to the moon
Will see 19.50-20 after earnings
"$19 back in June, now with winter approaching and gas at $5+ and all time highs in Europe....this can't even get back to $19....."

Based on the numbers from several related carriers the price drop is not company specific. Most high prices occurred anout the 2nd week of June and has steadily dropped.KMI. 19.14. 16.48. -13.9%EPD. 25.26. 22.08. -12.6%PAA. 12.28. 9.61. -21.8%MMP 53.48. 48.05. -10.2%WMB. 28.23. 24.26. -14.1Just a sector that is out of favor until the US freezes this winter or the Russians cut off Europe.
"""protect the balance sheet""""the board will make that decision in December"" but i want to give you 1.25, we have the money etc...what else will we hear on the 20th ?"
Maybe Goldman's 15 target was correct.
Any predictions on how far the market will drop during this administration?
another day with strong volume and oil spiking.
IF we think back to end of Q1 or early Q2 KMI announced that they were going to operate an energy trading desk...Well any idiot buying oil and gas contracts back then should be able to show a $250+ Million gain on those contracts... (conversely anyone selling contracts has taken a beating) This may be one of the lights that may have gone off in the heads of the rocket scientists on Wall Street..

"This is Kinder Morgan and why I think their cap ex is going to significantly increase. Probably the reason RK hasn’t made a buy in over a year. He typically bought on a regular basis. The dividend will be dependent on how much cash is needed. A lot of KMI’s pipeline system is 70 years old and is at the end of it’s life cycle. This is also related to the El Paso pipeline explosion and the pipeline failure in Texas. “Kinder Morgan was also cited by PHMSA for the following safety violations in 2011:• Failing to maintain updated maps showing pipeline locations;• Failing to test pipeline safety devices;• Failing to maintain proper firefighting equipment;• Failing to inspect its pipelines;• Failing to adequately monitor pipelines’ corrosion levels.According to a September 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal, a small research firm called Hedgeye Risk Management issued a report that criticized Kinder Morgan’s maintenance record. Hedgeye Risk Management’s Kevin Kaiser accused the company of cutting its pipeline maintenance spending “to a minimum.” Kaiser also accused Kinder Morgan of using those funds to “boost the cash it pays to shareholders and to the general partner that controls the company.”“We believe that Kinder Morgan’s high-level business strategy is to starve its pipelines and related infrastructure of routine maintenance spending in order to maximize distributable cash flow,” Kaiser stated in the report.”"
