"From KMI's 12/3/2018 Press Release:"" As first stated in KMI’s second quarter 2017 earnings release, KMI expects to increase the declared dividend per common share for 2019 to $1.00 per share (annualized), beginning with $0.25 per share for the Q1 2019 dividend (which is paid in Q2 2019), a 25 percent increase from the 2018 dividend and a 100 percent increase from the 2017 dividend. KMI also continues to expect to increase the dividend to $1.25 per share (annualized) for 2020."""
"the T of pipelines never goes any where. too much debt but they keep running it up. forget raising the divi or buying back shares ,pay down debt is the only way out of this muck"
"In the last 12 months KMI insiders have sold 678,251 shares and bought 56,890. RK has made no buys in the last 12 months."
Especially with this company it’s important to study the financial statements and also review the pipeline map.
"May 03-- May 3--A subsidiary of Houston-based pipeline operator Kinder Morgan (KMI) has signed a deal that will allow it to supply greater volumes of natural gas to upstate New York.New York utility company Con Edison recently signed a new natural gas supply agreement with the Kinder Morgan (KMI)-owned Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.Under the deal, Tennessee Gas Pipeline would provide the increased natural gas capacity to Con Edison's distribution system in Westchester County, New York by upgrading its compression facilities outside of the Empire State.Tennessee Gas Pipeline already supplies natural gas to the rural county just north of New York City but the upgrades are expected to boost volumes in Con Edison's distribution system. Subject to regulatory approvals, the increased capacity could be placed in service by November 2023.Con Edison and Tennessee Gas Pipeline signed the deal a time when demand for natural gas has grown significantly in Westchester County, New York City and New England.The increased demand has been attributed to conversions of heating systems from oil to natural gas, as well as economic growth, with developers preferring natural gas in new buildings.Although the Marcellus Shale is the top producer of natural gas in the United States, New York State has blocked pipelines companies from building new natural gas pipelines or expanding existing ones within the state.In a statement, Con Edison officials said the agreement with Tennessee Gas Pipeline supports continued economic growth and boosts natural gas supplies without having to build a new pipeline.The deal also allows the utility company to lift its moratorium on new natural gas hookups in Westchester County.At the same time, Con Edison is providing $223 million of incentives to customers who are interested in alternatives to natural gas such as electric heating systems, upgrading HVAC controls, installing geothermal heat pumps or weatherizing their homes.""The increased gas capacity plan allows more time for technologies to advance, and for customer adoption to increase for alternative heating and cooking solutions,"" the company said in a statement."
it's the kmi two-step. it's one step up and two steps back. okay i think you got it.
"NEWS::::: Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), meanwhile, said its Products (SE) Pipe Line Corporation (PPL) serving many of the same regions remains in full service.PPL is currently working with customers to accommodate additional barrels during Colonial's downtime, it said. PPL can deliver about 720,000 bpd of fuel through its pipeline network from Louisiana to the Washington, D.C., area."
"Between the Arizona pipeline issues, oil and gas down and general market correction vs fed tapering, adding at 15.80 for a long hold in the Roth for the div looking like a good bargain."
When will I get this under $17
and down we go . every f'in day just keeps dropping #$%$
"I’m sticking with kmi. Again, I could have done better, elsewhere, but including all the dividends I have received over the last 7 years, I am well ahead. Cramer and all the other ‘analysts’ can say what they want. Thanks to everyone for their posts."
Spend your wad of buyback cash right here. What are you waiting for Kinder?
"2021-08-06 17:34:592021-08-06KMI Martin Thomas A VP (Pres,Nat.Gas Pipelines) S - Sale $17.08 -66,607 1,049,602 -6% -$1,137,648"
Cannot understand why KMI has not returned to pre pandemic share price. Their 50000 barrels of oil produced each day grosses 1.4 Billion a year at current prices. Why won't this push to over 21 where I can set a stop loss sell order at around 20.75.
"$15s again, go joe"
RK will be back adding shares once div is paid.To Cheap to resist!
"I’ve been buying KMI when it reaches 16 I just bought another 25,000"
KMI historically changes distributions on an annual basis; so look for that discussion in Q4's earnings report; we will know the direction of commodity markets much clearer by then.
"KMI following oil down here. Part taper talk from Fed, part Covid- Delta strain putting the kabosh on the recovery from the anti-vax crowd. No logic to be found. Good news is: Yield is up and price is down. Natty gas will still keep the lights on and the A/Cs running."
Nice Seeking Alpha article out today by HFIR on Cheniere (LNG).......not interested in the company but like what the article says about the booming LNG market......
"This was a great quarter and year for KMI. The after hours price action doesn't mean anything. I will be adding tomorrow and Friday. I strongly believe we'll be over $18 within a month. Here's why I think it was a great year & quarter:1. At the start of 2018 the goal was $2.05 of DCF / share and 5.1 to 5 times Net Debt to EBITDA with a possible rating upgrade2. KMI came in at $2.12 DCF / share and 4.5 times Net Debt to EBITDA and got the upgrade. Both are huge beats that somehow get lost it EPS nonsense. 3. They sidestepped the biggest risk with the sale of Transmountain.The fact they were able to generate $2.12 in DCF is huge considering they sold Transmoutain, ELBA hasn't come online yet, and they funded other projects with internally generated cash flow. 2019 will have no preferred dividends, lower debt interest, and ELBA should be fully online and GCX is scheduled to come online towards the end of the year. I expect $2.30 DCF for 2019 which would be slightly above their guidance of $2.20. They have incredibly stable cash flow that rival regulated utilities. A lot has to go wrong for KMI to affect their cash flow. They will have plenty of coverage to raise 2021 dividend to $1.50. Load up, get the dividend, write the calls, and keep it going!"
If nat gas prices keep going up what's going to be the impact to earnings. It used to be something like every 10 cents was 10 million in dfc? Should be in for earnings beat between the spot price and volume demand.
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

"On August 10, 2014, Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) announced that it plans to acquire all the outstanding equity securities of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Management LLC, and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP in a deal valued at more than $70 billion. The combined entity will further Kinder Morgan’s reign as the largest energy infrastructure company in North America and the third largest energy company overall, with an estimated enterprise value of about $140 billion. The Kinder Morgan subsidiaries collectively own an interest in or operate approximately 80,000 miles of pipelines and 180 terminals currently. Its pipelines transport natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, CO2 and other products, and its terminals store petroleum products and chemicals and handle such products as ethanol, coal, petroleum coke, and steel.Key DetailsOwners of subsidiaries’ units will receive either shares in KMI or a combination of KMI shares and cash; the KMI shares will be at a premium compared against a July 16 reference dateThe reorganized company, a C-corp, will abandon the financial structure known as the master limited partnership (MLP)Although the proposed combination will eliminate the partnership’s tax-free status, the arrangement will confer other tax benefits on the parent company, reducing income tax liabilities by about $20 billion over 14 years.Note that this figure is on corporate income; from the investor’s perspective, the consolidation counts as a taxable sale, which means they will owe approximately $4 to $25 per unit.The founder of the company, Richard Kinder, will likely receive a large payout (hundreds of millions of dollars) as a result of the transaction."
"WOOOOWWWKMI Has 37,000,000Shares still short ?Someone is asleep at the wheel Good size hurricane coming and the last 3 KMI was the biggest benefactor from storms .Seems ultra risky to me, considering how cheap KMI is, they have to cover even if they buy it all up to 17-17.50This thing is only trading 6-7m a dayTHOSE SHORTS better get on their horses SOON!"
Boinionioniong!
"We just went through a period where oil and gasoline volume plummeted by record level and oil traded negative. KMI was able to maintain and raise their dividend from operational cash flow. +6% yield and rising seems like a steal in an environment where new investment has dried up, yet thier infrastructure remains as vital as ever."
What a beautiful stock!
KMI debt in 2007 was 41BIt’s now 33B
"Energy in rally mode, did not see this coming!"
KMI has dropped about $2 over the last few weeks.Will it turn around ?
"If an higher XLE translates to a higher KMI, this should be a good day!"
Can anyone explain why the share price is so low when nat gas prices are so high?
"down again , imagine that"
Buy order in at 16.98
Hydropower production down sharply across the parched West. Some of that deficit will be supplied by KMI at market rates $$.
"This wasn't a terrible quarter and it will be by far their worst quarter as things improve. Here are my takeaways:They paid down another $150 million in debt this quarter, paid dividends, and funded capex all with internally generated cash flow. Despite lower EBITDA they will have less net debt at the end of 2020 and more cash on their balance sheet. They still generated .44 a share in DCF this quarter. They have lowered capex guidance which means more future cash flow can go to increased dividends, paying down debt, and buying shares back which have a cash flow yield of 14%. If KMI can get back to $5B of DCF, pay out $2.4B in dividends, fund 1.5B of capex, they will have an extra $1B to return to shareholders. Permian Highway is on track. This is good news.They updated their investor presentation to show 2020 dividend at 1.10 which reflects them paying .3125 in the 4th quarter. In April they had it at 1.05 for 2020 now it's actually in the forecast at $1.10 which gives me more confidence it will be raised to $1.25 annualized in the 4th quarter. They will not pay any federal income tax until after 2026. If tax rates go up they can go back to FERC and add that into their cost of service. Lower interest rates will be a huge tailwind for KMI for the foreseeable future. Interest expenses on the credit line is tied to LIBOR . They can pay off some of the existing debt that is maturing over the next few months with the credit facility and save tens of millions on interest expense. Natural Gas Volumes were up 3% year over year so natural gas is still moving around the country. This is their core business and makes up most of the backlog. Natural gas will be needed to power the growing demand for electric vehicles, industrial demand, mining, and LNG demand. Barrick Gold announced on their last conference call their Nevada mines will be powered by natural gas pipelines next year. If you apply a 14 x EBITDA number on just the natural gas segment you are in the ballpark of KMI's total enterprise value. The products segment was only down 30% in Q2 despite guidance from Q1 that it would be down 45%. This segment did better than expected and will recover as the economy opens back up. This segment is rebounding quicker than they forecast. Terminals was very steady and benefited by increase demand for storage. Warren Buffet just paid roughly 10 x EBITDA for natural gas transmission pipelines. This would make KMI's natural gas segment worth $46B if you apply the same multiple. The products segment would be worth $12 billion and the terminals segment would be worth $11 billion for a combine value of $69 billion or a little bit more than the current enterprise value of KMI. If CO2 segment is worth $5 Billion than KMI is currently 15% undervalue based on the current price. Despite the worst quarter imaginable KMI still generated tons of cash, paid down debt, funded capex, and paid out a 7% annualized dividend. I am buying more shares tomorrow."
Why didn't you ask US producers to increase pumping instead of OPEC?
"If as Wiselama says that all supply is fully contracted and price or volume doesn't matter, then where will any future earnings growth come from and does that mean share price is stuck here for the foreseeable future?"
"With the price of Natty well over 5 clams, KMI should jack costs to move products across their lines. You cant let the producers lick all the cream."
Word on the street: KMI earnings at 0.23. Vs est of 0.19
A great and wide-ranging 40 minute webcast with CEO Steve Kean for the Citi Global Energy and Utility Conference (5/11/21) can be found under Investors tab on KMI website.They have their act together in an impressive way with a strong eye toward both domestic and global opportunities in a lower carbon future. I confidently added to my position here after watching.
Fully contracted does not mean full capacity. We have plenty of room to earn more on the unexpected.
"KMI is now the third largest holding in the energy ETF / Index which means it will heavily impacted in the short run with this index. This can be seen this morning with XLE down 2-3% KMI going down on light volume but then recovering as actual investors / non index flows buy KMI. KMI is in much better shape than upstream, super majors, and refiners. They are 63% natural gas which has been and will be growing. 13-15% terminals which are 99% contracted. 13-15% products pipelines which are experiencing lower volumes now but will keep recovering as people start driving and flying. There is no price exposure on the products segment just volume. Lastly, there C02 division is almost 100% hedged this year at $55 per barrel. Next year they make take a bigger hit but this only makes up around around 8% of EBITDA. Their natural gas segment alone is almost worth the current enterprise value at 12 x EBITDA. Let's assume you assign no value to C02 and a 5 x EBITDA to terminals and products that's another $11B of value or 30% more in equity value based on the current market cap."
Accretive ESG move announced.
Not expecting major movement until dividend announcement and then earnings(beat hopefully!).
Q2 will further illustrate the increasing value of responsive storage amidst a grid susceptible to the intermittency of renewable power generation and extreme weather.Pending Stagecoach acquisition adds some nice responsive storage assets (with storage pricing at market rates).
Can someone tell me what caused this to go from over $19 back down to $16. I can't understand the swings for a company that is improving and has stable cash flow.
"My thoughts on earnings --- somewhat disappointed.Divi remains safe and debt is under control, BUT-- Taken aback by magnitude of asset impairment which is out of the blue. That blows!-- Lack of any quantified NET growth drivers is the problem. Earnings flat to slightly down for as far as I can see.-- Asset impairment suggests problems or at lest longer term concerns in their core operations in a key marketWas hoping for more positive longer term guidance.I change my opinion from buy to hold. Will remain for dividend as that is important to me, but not expecting much appreciation in share price Safe, stable, good income but a lack of growth prospects.An aside, I saw no indication of their buying any shares -- or did I miss something?Maybe they plan to engage this now and why year end debt targets are higher than I hoped?I am NOT a big fan of buybacks, but they do gain the divi cost for those shares acquired."
"natgas price is zooming, now at 3.93. exports to foreign countries doing very well. don't think covid is going to shut down businesses again."
"@Wiselama, whatever the media tells their flock."
"KMI fun fact of the day: fines since 2000: Penalty total since 2000: $1,748,759,738. Most of the fines are for energy market manipulation, but they range all over."
"More writedowns, getting to be like the banks. Can't ever predict an actual profit. I love this stock, but dam!"
"A great acquisition, demonstrating KMI's keen eye to the future. RNG is in very early deployment with lots of growth ahead and helps get fleets and businesses to net zero."
Demand and price of nat. gas going up and KMI stock is not?

"Whoever pulled the sell lever here is mechanized, or incapable of seeing the trees for the forest. Buy."
great buy . great dividend
"Here's the bottom line on KMI. DCF was good for the second quarter showing that the divi / distribution is being covered . Overall KMI financials are tracking solidly quarter to quarter. We can't expect an unusual bounce in cash flow as we saw in the first quarter.' So what is the problem? Generally I think it lies with the markdown of assets. Sure we bought two entities but in the end those were offset by the write down of assets. Yes the write down is considered a non recurring event, but if such write downs occur on a regular basis then it is in reality a normal part of doing business. we will see what happens in the future. The bottom line is you own this stock for its divi and don't expect two much in share appreciation. Share buybacks look like they have been pushed to the back burner for now. Debt to EBITA looks nice but remember that this ratio is impacted by the EBITA being increased buy the boost in earnings from the storm, so best to look forward to next year and expect it to climb back up to 4.5 as they have telegraphed."
It pays 6% dividend why is it dropping?
"I think KMI is not a bad place to spend 100,000 for a 5% return over five years I have about 3500 shares now and this is a place to bury money Wiselama what do you think?"
"Lots of short term traders seem to be getting out so maybe a positive for the stock. If one is holding long term for the divs, great time to add this week -- nibbled a bit late afternoon with some excess divs accumulated in Roth and HSA. I don't see energy dropping anywhere near as low as last year since there won't likely be the widespread closures/lockdown this time around."
"Instead of fantasizing about oil at $100, stock buy backs, earnings, KMI at $20, and Texas freezing, maybe people should spend time studying KMI’s financial statements."
Here is the Max Pain reality... when I checked yesterday... the KMI pain point was $16... and the ET pain point was $9...A sihtload of positions have closed in both...And it appears that both will close... close to yesterdays pain point...Both of those tickers moved towards the pain point late yesterday... and danced around it today
"Just sold out of my XOM to buy KMI today. KMI pays a bigger dividend, which is easily covered by free cash flow, unlike XOM, and unlike XOM KMI has a natural gas and alternative energy business which are likely to do much better under green legislation than big oil will. Not to mention, KMI is actually historically cheap right now in term of valuation."
"RNG from dairy farms, landfills, wastewater facilities, etc is considered carbon **negative**Watch the industry explode, driven by both economics and climate policyKMI will be smack in the middle, driving Company value higher via selective/solid return investments while returning excess cash to shareholders at a very attractive dividend rateBuy, hold and relax"
statistics are showing bears have been active in the past month. hopefully it is time for a turnaround.
"KMI is going to report strong numbers after the bell. Volumes up, prices up, interest rates down...this is how we do it!"
1 hour left to buy the dividend!
Max Pain $16 tomorrow... lets see how that pans out
What a beautiful dividend 
KMI services NG to the west coast. During the heat wave CA will be importing NG to run its power plants.KMI will rock in 3rd Q
"The q1 billion gain, pay down of debt, increased dividend, the 25% increase in NG, ...The $16 share price makes no sense"
Not the strong earnings beat that I had anticipated; but call was not too bad either. I trimmed my position a bit after hours.The Company remains a reliable cash-generating machine with well-covered dividend and I'll stay for the yield.
Time for KMI to be buying shares!

"The company, which gets most of its revenue from pipeline and storage fees, will seek to also gain from buying and selling petroleum products, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named because the plan isn’t public. In a job post on LinkedIn, the company is looking for someone with at least seven years of experience in marketing and trading refined petroleum products who will be “responsible for developing profitable commercial opportunities.”The shift means that one of the most powerful companies in the U.S. fuel business is poised to gain even more clout.

There is some bad info being g handed out by posters like Stephen. I think it is an intentional and sick thing to do. The exdividend date is 30 July NOT 2 August. You need to own it on 29 July or you will not get the divvy. Do your own due diligence.

"Someone please correct my understanding, which is that KMI's share price is largely contingent on sheer volume of natural gas delivered, which in turn relies on forward demand for natural gas and the ability of suppliers to increase production. In other words, price of NG is only relevant to the extent that higher price = lower demand, thereby hurting KMI's earnings and share price. Then again, lower price of NG = lower production, which will decrease KMI's revenues. Based on this, what is the ideal macroeconomic scenario that long investors want to see for KMI to be successful?"

From KMI website:Feb div = 0 % ROEMay div = 65% ROENo posting for upcoming dividend in August.ROE = tax free but lowers cost basis.
"During the weekend it looked like today might be a stellar day for the energy sector. Think again. Opec, shmopeck."
What’s going on with KMI after hours? E*TRADE is showing that KMI is up $1.01. This stock needs to stop playing with my emotions. Ha
"Own 22,000 shares. Looking for a bump to 20. Then selling half my shares and keeping rest for at least 5 years. gme, tsla, spce, this market is a joke right now."
Kinder Morgan (KMI) sees higher income in 2021 and raises it's dividend 3% to $1.08 per share (annualized) with a $450M share repurchase planned. 2020 net income for KMI was $100M due to large impairment write downs from pandemic demand reductions. Management sees 2021 generating about $2.1B in profit on core earnings of $6.8B and DCF of $4.4B. KMI expects to spend $800M next year on expansion projects and joint ventures. (Source: Reuters).
"I was big into COP for the dividend but in 2014 they cut it by 2/3....2/3...2/3...I also hold WDC, the dividend appeared and disappeared in a three year period...Don't count on dividends when revenues are tanking year after year."
Can someone check on Al? Make sure he's doing OK today.He's probably alternately engrossed in Thomas Paine readings and sticking needles in his Rich Kinder doll.
"Earning report after the bell. Miss, meet, or beat?"
So with NG storage probably going to be at dangerously low levels come this winter... and production lagging here at the end of summer... with not all that mich time for production and overall storage to recover...Who thinks that North East storage for NYC and environs they recently bought will be a winner come January and February?
"When they're telling not to buy energy stocks, load up."
KMI on the move 
"It is true that this company is doing a great job.Following the price action, a double bottom appears to be forming in the zone between $ 16.90 and $ 17. If not, and continue to decline, it could reach the $ 16.2o area. There it must coincide with the 38% of Fibonasci and with the ascending Mobil Average of 200 periods that must act as strong support.I believe that where they are at the moment they should no longer be sold. For me it is already in the shopping area. I would divide my capital into 3 or 4 parts to make several purchases. If it falls more, then I buy more.This is just a comment. Everyone must do their own analysis."
Next week
KMI's Oil Assets should be extremely profitable at these oil prices! LNG shipments should be maxed out!NatGas pipes are screaming throughput volumes.Should easily be $20 stock!
Good thing this pays a dividend otherwise there would be no reason to hold it. Still should be back over $20. Must be in an unloved index or something that I don't understand.
OH COME ON FOR CH$%&ST SAKES............so tired holding this for years and go nowhere.
"That means something different and fundamental has changed but is not yet fully understood in the NG market, it is fooling some great traders and their systems--Any ideas??"
Based on the numbers from several related carriers the price drop is not company specific. Most high prices occurred anout the 2nd week of June and has steadily dropped.KMI. 19.14. 16.48. -13.9%EPD. 25.26. 22.08. -12.6%PAA. 12.28. 9.61. -21.8%MMP 53.48. 48.05. -10.2%WMB. 28.23. 24.26. -14.1Just a sector that is out of favor until the US freezes this winter or the Russians cut off Europe.
"Relatively low(er) risk buy here at 16.00 imo. It's just that if overall markets tank, then everything gets a haircut. Good place to scale in or maybe add."
if kinder keeps buying back shares....could this ever hit $40 again.....???
Everything you sell I buy. I rather holding KMI instead of Paper USD
will be at this price forever
Rich Kinder just needs to take it private for $20 and put us stockholders out of our misery.
Maybe Goldman's 15 target was correct.
“To argue with a person who has renounced the use of reason is like administering medicine to the dead.”~Thomas Paine
$16 looks like a buy.
With Nat gas at $4.70 what is the hold up? Prices going down crashed the stock but prices going up don't raise it?Revenue will increase.
I see Permabear Al is getting more perky.
Cool trick - look up a stock on Yahoo Finance and one of the top three holders will be Blackrock. KMI included. Try it out.
Bought under $16

what is going on with the Dividend? When is KMI going to pay it. Shouldn't they have paid it in August?
What happened here. This should be over $20 not back below $18
Headed back to $17
Beautiful dividend play
"Is the coming ex div holding up KMI today. Funny, OKE with a much higher dividend also goes ex on Friday and it is getting slaughtered."
"I had a small position in KMI (200 shs) just added 800 more at $16.00 this morning..... I like the entry point ...,"
"To me, KMI has been under appreciated for years. It is back on the acquisition train and is getting into the gas trading space. Richard knows what he is doing. Natural gas will be the backbone of all electricity generation around the globe. I'm sitting here having my divvys reinvested and loving life."
"OK, it closed at $20.00....... great, especially for those who aren't long-term holders & have a cost basis well below 20.Hat's off to you guys. But forgive us long-term shareholders for curbing our enthusiasm until it gets closer to the highs in the mid 40's of about 4 years ago."
This is a good article on how stuff works...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reno-airport-sees-fuel-shortage-215757435.html
"KMI- didn't factor in the Texas storm, $70 WTI, $3.60 Nat Gas, gasoline demand back to precovid , and jet fuel 90% of precovid when they did their 2021 forecast. This is going to be a big year for KMI! LNG demand is also very robust! Does anyone know how their cost of service contracts work with inflation on their regulated pipes? Do they get to tack on the 5% CPI rate?"
Are the dividends good ?
Trumka passed. What a shame
Listened to entirety of CCKMI was prepared and demonstrated very effective technical management during Texas winter stormThey demonstrated very astute financial management during the storm as wellBalance sheet improvingAnticipated pipeline volume increases as pandemic recedes with the potential for uplift in contract pricingEnergy transition opportunities in biofuels and CO2 sequestrationGlad to have purchased a few months ago and will remain a long term holder given the solid dividend and anticipated share price appreciation
back up the truck!
"Bravo to KMI management (and regulators), taking fewer than 6 weeks! to close the Stagecoach deal.Cost synergies, relief of potential bottlenecks in the NE corridor and valuable responsive storage assets are the prize as discussed in the Alliance Bernstein webcast in early June."
So the disappointment in the report is those lower volumes that are being produced are what has NG up near $4...Yet even with that robust NG pricing... transporters are expected to do so at lower rates...
Still weighing my options on exiting this position. Love the dividend but do not want to be holding if the Covid situation facilitates a 10% correction. If the market drops 10% do you think KMI will follow or will the dividend keep it from following the market all the way down?
Really under $16
KMI down -16% since mid June when it was a tad above $19. I’d say another buying opportunity is drawing near.
"KMI got a credit upgrade yesterday - news article from brokers site but did not see elsewhere.S&PGR Upgrds Kinder Morgan To 'BBB/A-2', Off CW Pos; Otlk Stbl2:22 pm ET January 7, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintPress Release: S&PGR Upgrds Kinder Morgan To 'BBB/A-2', Off CW Pos; Otlk StblThe following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings:-- Diversified midstream energy company Kinder Morgan Inc.

Still one of the worst holdings I have. Once they dissolved KMP I should have sold. Keeps going lower & lower.
Been in for years but I must say it has been a real sow
Unbelievable! The company make a BILLION dollars more then expected and the market doesn't care.Huge reduction in debt in one quarter and a much stronger company going forwardCarbon capture has a lot of tailwinds with the current administration with current players having a big head startLong KMI!
"I guess KMI selloff yesterday before close is mist more option expiration manipulation by the large instit. A shame I thought since KMI is such a strong stable company they woudnt mess with it . For option purposes, I guess no stock is safe from the manipulation surrounding options. Was a clear breakout this week , or maybe they made it seem that way to sell then steal call premiums ."
"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan posted first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The strong quarterly earnings were aided by higher contribution from Texas intrastate systems and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline during the winter storm in February. Moreover, favorable conditions in the CO2 segment boosted the results.The company announced a hike of 3% in first-quarter 2021 dividend from the fourth-quarter 2020 level, as previously planned. The latest dividend of 27 cents per share translates to $1.08 on an annualized basis. The dividend is expected to be paid on May 17 to Kinder Morgan’s shareholders of record as of Apr 30.Notably, Kinder Morgan significantly raised its 2021 net income expectation to the range of $2.7-$2.9 billion. The company projects DCF for this year within $5.1-$5.3 billion. In 2021, the leading North American energy infrastructure company expects $900 million to be used in sustaining capital expenditures. The company further informed that its Louisiana Pipeline’s Acadiana expansion plan is expected to come online by first-quarter 2022. (Kinder Morgan Q1 Earnings Beat on Texas Winter Storm)"
"Don’t look now, folks....Zacks has bumped kmi up to rank #2, ‘buy.’"
"W, Cramer says the vaccine should be a mandate"
With 15K shares this is very painful!
"My largest holding, but stopped my drip. Will just sit on the dividends in cash for now."
"Earth to KMI investors. With not much effort I can find articles as far back as January 30, 2021 that state the dividend will be increased to $1.08. Yesterday was just the required legal board declaration with the statutory dates. So I am not sure why you were all expecting a boosts. Anyone half interested in the stock has known the new dividend for almost 3 months."
Every time I look at this it’s down more after hours. The only way someone could be surprised by the earnings report is if they thought Texas froze in June. The contract information was old news.
"Lot of natural gas shorts, good traders actually, who have been making a killing in recent years are now getting taken to cleaners the last two months! Out there beezwaxxxx??"
Perfect for buybacks. I expect them to be in the market now. 1.4 B authorized
Waiting for $16.21
KMI should be priced at under 5% vs. 6.2% imo. The street is still hearing footsteps from years ago and isn't paying attention to KMI's return to growth evidenced by its recent acquisitions. Buy.
"prices up, prices down, Afghanistan collapsing, Covid rising, global warming, floods, fires, famines. However tomorrow the dividend goes into my account so I will tune it all out! Amazing what a few bottles of scotch and gin in the cabinet can do for one's mental health!Stay safe fellow longs!"

"The Fed didn’t say they are taking the punch bowl away, just that after midnight they ain’t tapping any more kegs. The cheerleaders are having fun right now, time to make the move!"
Crossed over on chart 16.50+ close then onto 18-19
I'm out. Made 20K plus 2 dividends. Will reassess after correction.
what is the Dividend pay date
If most KMI pipelines are fully subscribe by contract and a large majority of the contracts are pay-whether-used-or-not .... it doesn’t seem the current situation would move the earning needle much. Due to much less gasoline consumption (refinery issues/roads with snow) less petroleum products to be moved and probably some hedging one could conclude there would be less of an effect to KMI price. Maybe there is a positive with less likelihood of a contract default by a customer. I think most of any move made by KMI would be (1) dividends and to a lessor extent (2) debt reduction. Unless there is a source of higher DCF per share this is a range bound stock. I could be wrong ... I couldn’t tell the difference between butter or Chiffon Margerine!!!
"A worthwhile watch:Bobby Tudor Keynote Presentation at Future of Global Energy ConferenceJun 30, 2021(available on you tube)The presentation focuses on Houston (KMI headquarters) as a global hub for innovation in a lower carbon energy future."
"If you think for one moment that the big oil and gas companies won't emerge with their own idea of energy's future, you need to get educated on how the real world works. It will lead to more demand for pipelines. Buy."
What I take from the report is new contracts are for lower volumes at lower rates...Its not a horror story but that is what they said...It also flies in the face of all those that keep implying that existing pipelines are worth more... because you cant build new ones...Well the impairment is proof that pipelines are valued by their cash flows and the infrastructure is worth less when less cash is generated...Additionally the impairment shows that production is way down which means less volumes (at lower rates) meaning there is plenty of available capacity.... which circles back to the fact that while its all but impossible to build new pipelines... new pipelines are not necessary because there is plenty of excess capacity at this time.Non GAAP results on opps were fine... but the report is gonna leave a metallic taste in your mouth... it enough to sustain you... but you certainly did not enjoy the meal...
Man....if anyone bought back around the end of 2014 and into 2015 in the $40 area they still would not be back to even after the dividend was reinvested. And then figure in the lost opportunity that could have been obtained elsewhere.
Just grabbed some more at 15.99
"Don’t buy KMI calls people , if you like it ONLY buy the shares . They will only steal your money , time after time"
LOL
It's a utility stock that has a range bound share price and good dividend.No share price appreciation over the long term.It's not a growth stock ....don't expect magic.
"Guess who?A prime example of our thinking is our gradual increase in the dividends we pay our shareholders. I’ll remind you, we've gone from $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018 to $1 in 2019, and as promised, intend to pay $1.25 for 2020, and all of those dividends have been amply covered by our cash flow."
"Interesting deal news re Berkshire and Dominion (Questar) pipe. “Dominion said it will seek an alternative buyer for Questar, with a target close of the end of 2021. Dominion executives said there were no U.S. antitrust findings against the agreement to sell Questar to Berkshire, but the process to complete the deal was taking too long, Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst Shahriar Pourreza said in a note to clients.“No anticompetitive findings and pulling of the process leads us to believe there could be another buyer, with likely better terms, in our view,” Pourreza said in the note.”"
Sell the news on earnings beating big oil is hammering the XLE and the pipelines with it.
Trading down in after hours. Report is ok but not like the last quarter
I have a 5k share GTC @ $15.50 in for months... since the Q1 EPS...Im hoping it fills...
Really thought a push beyond 18.50 was in the cards for today. Unfortunately it's an up tech down cyclical/oil gas day.
Heat wave in west usa is good for KMI.
Wanna see how to get KMI below $17.... $17 seems to be holding as support rather well
"13 Dec 2018 Toronto, December 13, 2018 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") upgraded Kinder Morgan, Inc.'s (KMI) senior unsecured rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and other rating per the below rating list. The commercial paper rating was upgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-3. The outlook has been changed to stable from positive. ""The upgrade to Baa2 reflects improving leverage, with debt/EBITDA declining below 5x in 2019 when Kinder Morgan applies its approximate $2 billion in cash proceeds from the Kinder Morgan Canada distribution to debt reduction"" said Terry Marshall, Moody's Senior Vice President. ""Kinder Morgan has been an early-mover amongst midstream companies in improving its credit profile, dating back to 2014 when it reduced its complexity through consolidation, followed by a significant dividend reduction, reduction of growth capex and reduced project risk from 100% via JV partners and, most recently, lowering its leverage target and reducing debt."""
Natgas use OFF the Charts! Huge gain for KMI recent storage acquisition
Markets are at record highs and KMI was $44.67 on 4-23-2015. Just a reminder.
"If the Jones Act tankers aren't turning a good buck, maybe they can be fitted for cruise ships.People can't wait to get back on those petrie dishes!"
IDK... with growth opportunities limited... KMI it appears will be using that FCF to buy assets on the cheap....Remember... KMI sold KMI Canada @ 13Xs TTM EBITDA in 2019.... (and thats a vibrant 2018ish EBITDA) we now see KMI make two transactions in less than 3 Months at 6-8Xs TTM EBITDA (2020 ish) that was already somewhat depressed by Covid... (these deals could be at 4-6Xs 2018/2019 EBITDA)Its hard to argue with the logic of what they are doing... but with no published #s we are in the dark as to the potential of this...If a rebounding economy lifts all ships... the strategy is rock solid...And dipping ones toe into green energy does not hurt
Cuomo is gone maybe we can get more NG into New York.
Just a great entry point for KMI! 
when's the ex-div date?
Some interesting hard stats for Tony because... he knows better..ET is 18% below its range before the Covid crisis hit...KMI is 7% below when the Covid crisis hit...ET was paying $1.22... and now pays $.61... a 50% hair cut...KMI was paying $1... and now pays $1.08... plus 8%...And yet Im told ET is outperforming KMI... I guess if we cherry pick dates... trading off bottoms he is right....But when the blinders are taken off... IF you were a KMI share holder in February of 2020 when Covid hit... you are far better off in KMI....
boo
"KMI down nearly 10% from July 9 to July 19. Big haircut.Guidance reduced for coming Qtr.If you're going to exit, it may plump up just before ex-div net week."
Pipeline stocks are dropping today because the FERC has dis allowed them from recovering tax credits on interstate oil and gas pipelines. That may not be 100% correct but look it up.
2nd qtr. was good. Keep in mind the economy was still locked down in the first quarter. The 3rd and 4th qtr.s will be stronger. The acquisitions will add value. We’re going higher.
I'm out...
