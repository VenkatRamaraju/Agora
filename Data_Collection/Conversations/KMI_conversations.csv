Unbelievable! The company make a BILLION dollars more then expected and the market doesn't care.Huge reduction in debt in one quarter and a much stronger company going forwardCarbon capture has a lot of tailwinds with the current administration with current players having a big head startLong KMI!
"Just prior to COVID, KMI traded around $20...........in July KMI approached $20 again but failed to hold. Why is $20 so very difficult to achieve, seems stuck here at $17. Any comments?"
"Down on volume, carefully watch KMI’s cap ex budget."
"The q1 billion gain, pay down of debt, increased dividend, the 25% increase in NG, ...The $16 share price makes no sense"
"Up 41 cents,,,,,,,,"
1 hour left to buy the dividend!
"Hey Wiseone....I hope your GTC order at 15.50 gets filled. If you lower it, I get it as I have been short the SP500 for the last 3 weeks and sold off all my non energy related stocks. I should be able to get more of these on the cheap and hold for 5+ years."

almost every stock has low volume today.Apathy has set in
"It looks like we will be stuck until you read the headline, ""Delta cases have dropped significantly"". Then it's back to 18+ in short order. The question is how low will this drop before that."
"The company, which gets most of its revenue from pipeline and storage fees, will seek to also gain from buying and selling petroleum products, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named because the plan isn’t public. In a job post on LinkedIn, the company is looking for someone with at least seven years of experience in marketing and trading refined petroleum products who will be “responsible for developing profitable commercial opportunities.”The shift means that one of the most powerful companies in the U.S. fuel business is poised to gain even more clout. Co-founded by billionaire Rich Kinder, the Houston-based firm operates about 3,000 miles of refined-product pipelines from Texas and California to Oregon and Washington.From Bloomberg: Notice ""One of the most powerful companies in the US fuel business is poised to gain even more clout"""

"It is true that this company is doing a great job.Following the price action, a double bottom appears to be forming in the zone between $ 16.90 and $ 17. If not, and continue to decline, it could reach the $ 16.2o area. There it must coincide with the 38% of Fibonasci and with the ascending Mobil Average of 200 periods that must act as strong support.I believe that where they are at the moment they should no longer be sold. For me it is already in the shopping area. I would divide my capital into 3 or 4 parts to make several purchases. If it falls more, then I buy more.This is just a comment. Everyone must do their own analysis."
"Did KMI firm up ER date, it shows tentative 10/19 on anything I am reading? Energy looks to be a good place to invest as oil prices are at 7 year highs......anyone else think $20 soon?"
Whooooo Hoooooo $$$$$$$
It pays 6% dividend why is it dropping?
Motley Fool must have received a gift basket from Mr Kinder. Several recent articles from them in the past 10 days or so.
"We just went through a period where oil and gasoline volume plummeted by record level and oil traded negative. KMI was able to maintain and raise their dividend from operational cash flow. +6% yield and rising seems like a steal in an environment where new investment has dried up, yet thier infrastructure remains as vital as ever."
boo
Don’t buy their calls. Only going to take your. Money. If you like KMI stick with the shares !
Can someone get Rich Kinder on the horn and tell him we capitulate and buy us out for $20
Can someone check on Al? Make sure he's doing OK today.He's probably alternately engrossed in Thomas Paine readings and sticking needles in his Rich Kinder doll.
"KMI got a credit upgrade yesterday - news article from brokers site but did not see elsewhere.S&PGR Upgrds Kinder Morgan To 'BBB/A-2', Off CW Pos; Otlk Stbl2:22 pm ET January 7, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintPress Release: S&PGR Upgrds Kinder Morgan To 'BBB/A-2', Off CW Pos; Otlk StblThe following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings:-- Diversified midstream energy company Kinder Morgan Inc.

KMI gives ESGs a more politically correct way to latch onto the energy boom. Buy.
What's with the spike in after hrs. price? Anyone with any insight?
Good thing this pays a dividend otherwise there would be no reason to hold it. Still should be back over $20. Must be in an unloved index or something that I don't understand.
"Relatively low(er) risk buy here at 16.00 imo. It's just that if overall markets tank, then everything gets a haircut. Good place to scale in or maybe add."
"13 Dec 2018 Toronto, December 13, 2018 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") upgraded Kinder Morgan, Inc.'s (KMI) senior unsecured rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and other rating per the below rating list. The commercial paper rating was upgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-3. The outlook has been changed to stable from positive. ""The upgrade to Baa2 reflects improving leverage, with debt/EBITDA declining below 5x in 2019 when Kinder Morgan applies its approximate $2 billion in cash proceeds from the Kinder Morgan Canada distribution to debt reduction"" said Terry Marshall, Moody's Senior Vice President. ""Kinder Morgan has been an early-mover amongst midstream companies in improving its credit profile, dating back to 2014 when it reduced its complexity through consolidation, followed by a significant dividend reduction, reduction of growth capex and reduced project risk from 100% via JV partners and, most recently, lowering its leverage target and reducing debt."""

If most KMI pipelines are fully subscribe by contract and a large majority of the contracts are pay-whether-used-or-not .... it doesn’t seem the current situation would move the earning needle much. Due to much less gasoline consumption (refinery issues/roads with snow) less petroleum products to be moved and probably some hedging one could conclude there would be less of an effect to KMI price. Maybe there is a positive with less likelihood of a contract default by a customer. I think most of any move made by KMI would be (1) dividends and to a lessor extent (2) debt reduction. Unless there is a source of higher DCF per share this is a range bound stock. I could be wrong ... I couldn’t tell the difference between butter or Chiffon Margerine!!!

Just grabbed some more at 15.99
Did someone send out a memo that KMI has THE LARGEST NG PIPELINE SYSTEM in the USSeriously... that has to be worth something at this time
time to sell?
My buy price of $16.21 definitely gonna hit today!
This stock should be 20 can not hold 18. Talk about out of favor.
annnnd another great day by the dog of dogs
"Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan posted first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The strong quarterly earnings were aided by higher contribution from Texas intrastate systems and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline during the winter storm in February. Moreover, favorable conditions in the CO2 segment boosted the results.The company announced a hike of 3% in first-quarter 2021 dividend from the fourth-quarter 2020 level, as previously planned. The latest dividend of 27 cents per share translates to $1.08 on an annualized basis. The dividend is expected to be paid on May 17 to Kinder Morgan’s shareholders of record as of Apr 30.Notably, Kinder Morgan significantly raised its 2021 net income expectation to the range of $2.7-$2.9 billion. The company projects DCF for this year within $5.1-$5.3 billion. In 2021, the leading North American energy infrastructure company expects $900 million to be used in sustaining capital expenditures. The company further informed that its Louisiana Pipeline’s Acadiana expansion plan is expected to come online by first-quarter 2022. (Kinder Morgan Q1 Earnings Beat on Texas Winter Storm)"
"This was a great quarter and year for KMI. The after hours price action doesn't mean anything. I will be adding tomorrow and Friday. I strongly believe we'll be over $18 within a month. Here's why I think it was a great year & quarter:1. At the start of 2018 the goal was $2.05 of DCF / share and 5.1 to 5 times Net Debt to EBITDA with a possible rating upgrade2. KMI came in at $2.12 DCF / share and 4.5 times Net Debt to EBITDA and got the upgrade. Both are huge beats that somehow get lost it EPS nonsense. 3. They sidestepped the biggest risk with the sale of Transmountain.The fact they were able to generate $2.12 in DCF is huge considering they sold Transmoutain, ELBA hasn't come online yet, and they funded other projects with internally generated cash flow. 2019 will have no preferred dividends, lower debt interest, and ELBA should be fully online and GCX is scheduled to come online towards the end of the year. I expect $2.30 DCF for 2019 which would be slightly above their guidance of $2.20. They have incredibly stable cash flow that rival regulated utilities. A lot has to go wrong for KMI to affect their cash flow. They will have plenty of coverage to raise 2021 dividend to $1.50. Load up, get the dividend, write the calls, and keep it going!"
I'm curious what October's numbers will look like.
"Everywhere outside the USA NG is $25 MMBTU +, NYMEX NG is $5 mmbtu +. US Majors should be printing $$$."

great buy . great dividend

"$15s again, go joe"
Cha-ching $$$$$$
Fast Money panel loving KMI. Najarian says it s/b where it was 7 years ago.
"There is a lot of momentum building here and earnings will be announced in less than two weeks. After a dozen of so ho-hum earnings releases, KMI needs to show something really positive. Perhaps a suprise dividend increase or Richard's death would help."
"Certainly $19 before end of year, possibly $20 but likely by Feb/ Mar. Any price gains after that will be short lived, but $20 should hold barring negative events."
"NEW position in KMI today....$16 presents reliable support, see 1/2021 to 3/2021.So pulled back to previous base, held support at 200 day moving average.In most recent 13F filing, from 8/26 for Q2 largest shareholders increased positions. KMI now having bullish reversal off 200 day. Energy stocks, after healthy pullback poised to regain footing. with strong EPS, cash flow and sales bolstered by pinch on supplies. KMI also in the top 3 % of dividend paying stocks in S&P 500"
I consider KMI a very solid holding. There is a great future ahead for this company.
I sure hope the Stagecoach 41BCF of natural gas storage is going to work out this Winter. Hopefully they don't have it tied to a 100% hedged contract with Consolidated Edison. If they don't then it is going to be a great year for KMI along with everything else tied to NG.

What a beautiful dividend 
"My broker just recommended this stock, he is getting some of investor money into this. He said with winter comming it could go up quite a bit."
So with NG storage probably going to be at dangerously low levels come this winter... and production lagging here at the end of summer... with not all that mich time for production and overall storage to recover...Who thinks that North East storage for NYC and environs they recently bought will be a winner come January and February?
"When energy prices went down many oil and gas stocks went down a lot, now the energy prices have gone up double and stocks seem don't go up at all, this market is a scam"
21 by year end 2021.Sit back and watch!
NATURAL GAS $6.198 +0.432 +7.49%Why is KMI flat???
NG 5.22 mmbtu and this mutt just sits at $16
Wanna see how to get KMI below $17.... $17 seems to be holding as support rather well
"I know it was 1 day before ex dividend but I sold 5000 shares at 17.98 today. It was just too large of a position and am left with 10,000 shares which is a much better fit. Plus I made some good money!"
Here is the Max Pain reality... when I checked yesterday... the KMI pain point was $16... and the ET pain point was $9...A sihtload of positions have closed in both...And it appears that both will close... close to yesterdays pain point...Both of those tickers moved towards the pain point late yesterday... and danced around it today
Time for KMI to be buying shares!
"Own 22,000 shares. Looking for a bump to 20. Then selling half my shares and keeping rest for at least 5 years. gme, tsla, spce, this market is a joke right now."
Really under $16
"Hey wiseone, looks like no fill for u yet!!!Your like a window washer in a wohre house!!! You can look, but they won't let you buy!!! lol"
Can someone tell me what caused this to go from over $19 back down to $16. I can't understand the swings for a company that is improving and has stable cash flow.
"down again , imagine that"
Just a great entry point for KMI! 
Up on volume. Another thing mr negative has wrong.
Looks like you might get your order filled at the open Mr. Wiselama.
"On a roadtrip that had me driving through Iowa listening to the am radio stations, its amusing how obsessed they are with their ethanol sacred cow. It seems old joe and the Democrats with their push for electric vehicles pose a serious threat to their racket. If they can manage to kill off ethanol before they destroy the rest of the economy the greenies will have accomplished one good thing."
Fully contracted does not mean full capacity. We have plenty of room to earn more on the unexpected.
"Lots of short term traders seem to be getting out so maybe a positive for the stock. If one is holding long term for the divs, great time to add this week -- nibbled a bit late afternoon with some excess divs accumulated in Roth and HSA. I don't see energy dropping anywhere near as low as last year since there won't likely be the widespread closures/lockdown this time around."
and down we go . every f'in day just keeps dropping #$%$
From KMI website:Feb div = 0 % ROEMay div = 65% ROENo posting for upcoming dividend in August.ROE = tax free but lowers cost basis.
Can anyone who owns KMI tell me if they issue a K-1 or a 1099 at years end? thanks
Crossed over on chart 16.50+ close then onto 18-19
What a beautiful long term dividend hold!
it's the kmi two-step. it's one step up and two steps back. okay i think you got it.

"Here's the bottom line on KMI. DCF was good for the second quarter showing that the divi / distribution is being covered . Overall KMI financials are tracking solidly quarter to quarter. We can't expect an unusual bounce in cash flow as we saw in the first quarter.' So what is the problem? Generally I think it lies with the markdown of assets. Sure we bought two entities but in the end those were offset by the write down of assets. Yes the write down is considered a non recurring event, but if such write downs occur on a regular basis then it is in reality a normal part of doing business. we will see what happens in the future. The bottom line is you own this stock for its divi and don't expect two much in share appreciation. Share buybacks look like they have been pushed to the back burner for now. Debt to EBITA looks nice but remember that this ratio is impacted by the EBITA being increased buy the boost in earnings from the storm, so best to look forward to next year and expect it to climb back up to 4.5 as they have telegraphed."
"KMI down nearly 10% from July 9 to July 19. Big haircut.Guidance reduced for coming Qtr.If you're going to exit, it may plump up just before ex-div net week."
Omg I just bought in today. Thats some Nancy Palosi level market timing there for me!!!
During the big freeze in Texas last winter KMI recorded large one time gains due to the spike in natgas prices. Current gas prices are up quite a bit. Why won't KMI have a similar opportunity for gains?
"I’ve been buying KMI when it reaches 16 I just bought another 25,000"
"Guess who?A prime example of our thinking is our gradual increase in the dividends we pay our shareholders. I’ll remind you, we've gone from $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018 to $1 in 2019, and as promised, intend to pay $1.25 for 2020, and all of those dividends have been amply covered by our cash flow."
What a beautiful stock!
Hey Al... you're smarter than me... you mocked $15.50 two weeks ago...Can you help me out here and tell me my return of $2.50 on $15.50?
When will I get this under $17
"@Al: thanks for your response to my post, yesterday. If folks want to make money trading, fine. I’m a long term holder, and am doing well when you include the dividends. I’m sticking with it. I have admitted before, more than just once, that I could have done better, elsewhere. This equity sure beats t-bills and money market rates. I’ll take the risk to get a little more. Thanks again for your post."

Its only a matter of time before the midstreams start benefitting from the increase in energy prices.
So Al... how are all those buys at $15.50 the board posters made last week...As you mocked and said $12 was around the corner...
what is going on with the Dividend? When is KMI going to pay it. Shouldn't they have paid it in August?
"I had a small position in KMI (200 shs) just added 800 more at $16.00 this morning..... I like the entry point ...,"
"Just sold out of my XOM to buy KMI today. KMI pays a bigger dividend, which is easily covered by free cash flow, unlike XOM, and unlike XOM KMI has a natural gas and alternative energy business which are likely to do much better under green legislation than big oil will. Not to mention, KMI is actually historically cheap right now in term of valuation."
"the T of pipelines never goes any where. too much debt but they keep running it up. forget raising the divi or buying back shares ,pay down debt is the only way out of this muck"
Lets hope they can talk up Elba Isle LNG in the CC...Even if its speculative expansion hype
"This wasn't a terrible quarter and it will be by far their worst quarter as things improve. Here are my takeaways:They paid down another $150 million in debt this quarter, paid dividends, and funded capex all with internally generated cash flow. Despite lower EBITDA they will have less net debt at the end of 2020 and more cash on their balance sheet. They still generated .44 a share in DCF this quarter. They have lowered capex guidance which means more future cash flow can go to increased dividends, paying down debt, and buying shares back which have a cash flow yield of 14%. If KMI can get back to $5B of DCF, pay out $2.4B in dividends, fund 1.5B of capex, they will have an extra $1B to return to shareholders. Permian Highway is on track. This is good news.They updated their investor presentation to show 2020 dividend at 1.10 which reflects them paying .3125 in the 4th quarter. In April they had it at 1.05 for 2020 now it's actually in the forecast at $1.10 which gives me more confidence it will be raised to $1.25 annualized in the 4th quarter. They will not pay any federal income tax until after 2026. If tax rates go up they can go back to FERC and add that into their cost of service. Lower interest rates will be a huge tailwind for KMI for the foreseeable future. Interest expenses on the credit line is tied to LIBOR . They can pay off some of the existing debt that is maturing over the next few months with the credit facility and save tens of millions on interest expense. Natural Gas Volumes were up 3% year over year so natural gas is still moving around the country. This is their core business and makes up most of the backlog. Natural gas will be needed to power the growing demand for electric vehicles, industrial demand, mining, and LNG demand. Barrick Gold announced on their last conference call their Nevada mines will be powered by natural gas pipelines next year. If you apply a 14 x EBITDA number on just the natural gas segment you are in the ballpark of KMI's total enterprise value. The products segment was only down 30% in Q2 despite guidance from Q1 that it would be down 45%. This segment did better than expected and will recover as the economy opens back up. This segment is rebounding quicker than they forecast. Terminals was very steady and benefited by increase demand for storage. Warren Buffet just paid roughly 10 x EBITDA for natural gas transmission pipelines. This would make KMI's natural gas segment worth $46B if you apply the same multiple. The products segment would be worth $12 billion and the terminals segment would be worth $11 billion for a combine value of $69 billion or a little bit more than the current enterprise value of KMI. If CO2 segment is worth $5 Billion than KMI is currently 15% undervalue based on the current price. Despite the worst quarter imaginable KMI still generated tons of cash, paid down debt, funded capex, and paid out a 7% annualized dividend. I am buying more shares tomorrow."
This is a good article on how stuff works...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reno-airport-sees-fuel-shortage-215757435.html
KMI needs to build a big square pipeline from the major ports to push those containers far inland to terminals. Infrastructure!
"Bravo to KMI management (and regulators), taking fewer than 6 weeks! to close the Stagecoach deal.Cost synergies, relief of potential bottlenecks in the NE corridor and valuable responsive storage assets are the prize as discussed in the Alliance Bernstein webcast in early June."
Look how high natural gas price is now and we're not even in winter yet.....
will be at this price forever
"From KMI's 12/3/2018 Press Release:"" As first stated in KMI’s second quarter 2017 earnings release, KMI expects to increase the declared dividend per common share for 2019 to $1.00 per share (annualized), beginning with $0.25 per share for the Q1 2019 dividend (which is paid in Q2 2019), a 25 percent increase from the 2018 dividend and a 100 percent increase from the 2017 dividend. KMI also continues to expect to increase the dividend to $1.25 per share (annualized) for 2020."""
Rich Kinder just needs to take it private for $20 and put us stockholders out of our misery.
"My expectation is that KMI will break $20/sh when we get some sort of winter superstorm. We all know something is brewing that will cause the US gas infrastructure to be bottlenecked, causing spot prices to skyrocket. We all know that states have been quick to retire coal power and shifted to natural gas. Investments in solar/wind doesn't do anything when you have a massive winter storm icing up turbines and covering solar panels."
Still weighing my options on exiting this position. Love the dividend but do not want to be holding if the Covid situation facilitates a 10% correction. If the market drops 10% do you think KMI will follow or will the dividend keep it from following the market all the way down?
"First Buffett enters the natural gas pipeline space, now Carl Icahn. Up we go!"
"prices up, prices down, Afghanistan collapsing, Covid rising, global warming, floods, fires, famines. However tomorrow the dividend goes into my account so I will tune it all out! Amazing what a few bottles of scotch and gin in the cabinet can do for one's mental health!Stay safe fellow longs!"
So what happened with all that blather about KMI getting bought out?KMI will do what RK says it will do.He called me the other night.He ain't selling. Yet.Just take the loot.
20$+ by EOY easily
"I sold 10k shares about a 5 weeks ago at this same price. Unfortunately I sold the remaining 5k for 16.48 during beginning of the ""fake"" market correction. Should have bought back with the Wise one for 15.50. Oh well, good luck guys!"
"Even with prices dropping, 6 month low + hostile administration towards oil & gas = Excellent return....carry the dividend and have a winner."
"My largest holding, but stopped my drip. Will just sit on the dividends in cash for now."
Under $17 thank you Build Back Blunder
Cuomo is gone maybe we can get more NG into New York.
Still one of the worst holdings I have. Once they dissolved KMP I should have sold. Keeps going lower & lower.

"Small acquisitions will be the only action from KMI in the next couple of years, no new-build large projects. No Canadian slop, LNG will be strong, NatGas will have a solid future as electricity takes over fossils (next 20 yrs). Oil has reached high tide. Water will be the next commodity piped to redistribute to drought zones. KMI will lead the way. It ain't political, its the future. Even Big Oil is reading the tea leaves. KMI will never breach $20 without a new catalyst. It is a pure dividend play. Doubtful any buyout happens in next few years, unless it gets a lot cheaper."
BIG volume today....not sure why....
"Between the Arizona pipeline issues, oil and gas down and general market correction vs fed tapering, adding at 15.80 for a long hold in the Roth for the div looking like a good bargain."
Natural gas prices are at $5.10 per BTU. This means producers will be producing and transporters will be transporting a lot of natural gas. Not to mention the storage that will need to be filled up between now and the start of winter. $15.50 is a great price to add KMI.

"I have been in and out of this stock the past couple of years. Currently, I am 75% cash and cash equivalents however, upon the anticipated correction of the Market, I hope to make a major purchase of KMI."

50 dma has a date with the 200 dma.No reason to buy/add shares here. Wait for it to break 15 before buying/adding.
"Fast Money- Fast Pitch - Pete Narajian pitches KMI and said KMI should be $20 soon, all the guest 100$ agree with him, stock pop to $18.40-$18.50"
"This is Kinder Morgan and why I think their cap ex is going to significantly increase. Probably the reason RK hasn’t made a buy in over a year. He typically bought on a regular basis. The dividend will be dependent on how much cash is needed. A lot of KMI’s pipeline system is 70 years old and is at the end of it’s life cycle. This is also related to the El Paso pipeline explosion and the pipeline failure in Texas. “Kinder Morgan was also cited by PHMSA for the following safety violations in 2011:• Failing to maintain updated maps showing pipeline locations;• Failing to test pipeline safety devices;• Failing to maintain proper firefighting equipment;• Failing to inspect its pipelines;• Failing to adequately monitor pipelines’ corrosion levels.According to a September 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal, a small research firm called Hedgeye Risk Management issued a report that criticized Kinder Morgan’s maintenance record. Hedgeye Risk Management’s Kevin Kaiser accused the company of cutting its pipeline maintenance spending “to a minimum.” Kaiser also accused Kinder Morgan of using those funds to “boost the cash it pays to shareholders and to the general partner that controls the company.”“We believe that Kinder Morgan’s high-level business strategy is to starve its pipelines and related infrastructure of routine maintenance spending in order to maximize distributable cash flow,” Kaiser stated in the report.”"
"Kinder Morgan says Arizona natural gas pipeline fire put out, 2 dead"
What a beautiful income stock opportunity below $16
"KMI following oil down here. Part taper talk from Fed, part Covid- Delta strain putting the kabosh on the recovery from the anti-vax crowd. No logic to be found. Good news is: Yield is up and price is down. Natty gas will still keep the lights on and the A/Cs running."
Beautiful dividend play
Demand and price of nat. gas going up and KMI stock is not?
"all we need now is a market correction and its down to 14 or less, plus it never comes all the way back up , worst #$%$ i ever owned, but thats managements fault, too many lies"
Whole oil patch is up.KMI just rising with the tide...
Maybe Goldman's 15 target was correct.
If Kinder won’t buy at $12 why do people brag about buying at $15?
Bought under $16
Been in for years but I must say it has been a real sow
"Someone please correct my understanding, which is that KMI's share price is largely contingent on sheer volume of natural gas delivered, which in turn relies on forward demand for natural gas and the ability of suppliers to increase production. In other words, price of NG is only relevant to the extent that higher price = lower demand, thereby hurting KMI's earnings and share price. Then again, lower price of NG = lower production, which will decrease KMI's revenues. Based on this, what is the ideal macroeconomic scenario that long investors want to see for KMI to be successful?"
"OK, it closed at $20.00....... great, especially for those who aren't long-term holders & have a cost basis well below 20.Hat's off to you guys. But forgive us long-term shareholders for curbing our enthusiasm until it gets closer to the highs in the mid 40's of about 4 years ago."
I'm out...
"Starting to feel like KW disease may be effecting KMI shareholders. For those who don’t know, KW disease is a serious illness that affects ET unit holders and has aggressive symptoms similar to what occurs 10 minutes after eating a spicy 3-piece from Church’s Chicken"
Does anyone know if KMI has started pumping oil from its small holding?

"Ummm, natural gas is up 9% today, yes just one day."
$15.50 who’s addin’ ?
Nightmare stock
A great and wide-ranging 40 minute webcast with CEO Steve Kean for the Citi Global Energy and Utility Conference (5/11/21) can be found under Investors tab on KMI website.They have their act together in an impressive way with a strong eye toward both domestic and global opportunities in a lower carbon future. I confidently added to my position here after watching.
Any predictions on how far the market will drop during this administration?
What’s going on with KMI after hours? E*TRADE is showing that KMI is up $1.01. This stock needs to stop playing with my emotions. Ha
"KMI fun fact of the day: fines since 2000: Penalty total since 2000: $1,748,759,738. Most of the fines are for energy market manipulation, but they range all over."

"I love this stock, it will go up as soon as winter sets in!!"
another day with strong volume and oil spiking.
Will never buy a KMI call again .. 16.50 they teased and teased them …. I’m out on the KMI calls now for good !
LNG arbitrage opportunities 500% USA to Europe. Turn on the $$$ machine.
I see Permabear Al is getting more perky.
Why didn't you ask US producers to increase pumping instead of OPEC?
Markets are at record highs and KMI was $44.67 on 4-23-2015. Just a reminder.

I am all in as of the lasts 4 days. .....
"KMI is now the third largest holding in the energy ETF / Index which means it will heavily impacted in the short run with this index. This can be seen this morning with XLE down 2-3% KMI going down on light volume but then recovering as actual investors / non index flows buy KMI. KMI is in much better shape than upstream, super majors, and refiners. They are 63% natural gas which has been and will be growing. 13-15% terminals which are 99% contracted. 13-15% products pipelines which are experiencing lower volumes now but will keep recovering as people start driving and flying. There is no price exposure on the products segment just volume. Lastly, there C02 division is almost 100% hedged this year at $55 per barrel. Next year they make take a bigger hit but this only makes up around around 8% of EBITDA. Their natural gas segment alone is almost worth the current enterprise value at 12 x EBITDA. Let's assume you assign no value to C02 and a 5 x EBITDA to terminals and products that's another $11B of value or 30% more in equity value based on the current market cap."
I'm out. Made 20K plus 2 dividends. Will reassess after correction.
Dutch TTP is 7 times Henry Hub
"I’m starting to lose a bit of confidence here. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not selling, but my buy-on-weakness program that has been in effect for well over a year, is officially ON HOLD."
"One thing is for sure,winter is comin and its gonna get cold!"
Any one else wondering why KMI can’t get above $17 and keep going?
if kinder keeps buying back shares....could this ever hit $40 again.....???
With Nat gas at $4.70 what is the hold up? Prices going down crashed the stock but prices going up don't raise it?Revenue will increase.
Ole’ shorts must be getting all torn up. Gonna git ya little greenie wiener.
"KMI always seems to fully participate to the downside but not the big up days -- for comparison, EPD was up 6% over the last two days but is down today less than KMI (which did not go up at all the last couple of days). Certainly some curious price action in KMI of late......"
KMI should be priced at under 5% vs. 6.2% imo. The street is still hearing footsteps from years ago and isn't paying attention to KMI's return to growth evidenced by its recent acquisitions. Buy.
statistics are showing bears have been active in the past month. hopefully it is time for a turnaround.
Not the strong earnings beat that I had anticipated; but call was not too bad either. I trimmed my position a bit after hours.The Company remains a reliable cash-generating machine with well-covered dividend and I'll stay for the yield.
I think we will see KMI at $20 next year as the dollar drops.
"Looks like CEO bought almost $500,000 worth of stock last week"
Glad I sold at 16.96 and 16.46. Still hold OKE and WMB and beginning to think OKE may be best of breed. Will still consider adding KMI back in the 14-15 range. GL!
Hurricane Ida will bump this up to $17.50 by end of next week.....

why over a million shares in premarket?
Everything you sell I buy. I rather holding KMI instead of Paper USD
"Theres gotta be more volume of products pushed through those pipes, with NG between 5-6$. Processing facilities should be redlining and storage facilities over flowing. Producers had to step up their game somewhat even with the lack of capX. Earnings estimates will get trampled and upgrade will come.."
Nice Seeking Alpha article out today by HFIR on Cheniere (LNG).......not interested in the company but like what the article says about the booming LNG market......
"Don’t buy KMI calls people , if you like it ONLY buy the shares . They will only steal your money , time after time"
KMI down -16% since mid June when it was a tad above $19. I’d say another buying opportunity is drawing near.
"""Over the past three years, we have used our cash for all of those purposes in varying degrees. We have paid off over $8 billion of debt and reduced our debt-to-EBITDA ratio into our targeted 4.5 level, and had our credit rating upgraded by both S&P by Moody's. We've raised the dividend for $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018, and reiterated our intention to increase it to $1 in 2019 and to $1.25 in 2020. We have bought back over $500 million worth of shares and we have funded our growth capital without leading to access external sources."""
"I guess KMI selloff yesterday before close is mist more option expiration manipulation by the large instit. A shame I thought since KMI is such a strong stable company they woudnt mess with it . For option purposes, I guess no stock is safe from the manipulation surrounding options. Was a clear breakout this week , or maybe they made it seem that way to sell then steal call premiums ."
Coco... now thats a funny GIF
"May 03-- May 3--A subsidiary of Houston-based pipeline operator Kinder Morgan (KMI) has signed a deal that will allow it to supply greater volumes of natural gas to upstate New York.New York utility company Con Edison recently signed a new natural gas supply agreement with the Kinder Morgan (KMI)-owned Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.Under the deal, Tennessee Gas Pipeline would provide the increased natural gas capacity to Con Edison's distribution system in Westchester County, New York by upgrading its compression facilities outside of the Empire State.Tennessee Gas Pipeline already supplies natural gas to the rural county just north of New York City but the upgrades are expected to boost volumes in Con Edison's distribution system. Subject to regulatory approvals, the increased capacity could be placed in service by November 2023.Con Edison and Tennessee Gas Pipeline signed the deal a time when demand for natural gas has grown significantly in Westchester County, New York City and New England.The increased demand has been attributed to conversions of heating systems from oil to natural gas, as well as economic growth, with developers preferring natural gas in new buildings.Although the Marcellus Shale is the top producer of natural gas in the United States, New York State has blocked pipelines companies from building new natural gas pipelines or expanding existing ones within the state.In a statement, Con Edison officials said the agreement with Tennessee Gas Pipeline supports continued economic growth and boosts natural gas supplies without having to build a new pipeline.The deal also allows the utility company to lift its moratorium on new natural gas hookups in Westchester County.At the same time, Con Edison is providing $223 million of incentives to customers who are interested in alternatives to natural gas such as electric heating systems, upgrading HVAC controls, installing geothermal heat pumps or weatherizing their homes.""The increased gas capacity plan allows more time for technologies to advance, and for customer adoption to increase for alternative heating and cooking solutions,"" the company said in a statement."
Max Pain $16 tomorrow... lets see how that pans out

earnings and revenue report for the quarter should be interesting. lots of possible ups and downs with results but overall should be favorable imo.
Anyone see the $16.50 pre market trade... what was up wit dat?

"WOOOOWWWKMI Has 37,000,000Shares still short ?Someone is asleep at the wheel Good size hurricane coming and the last 3 KMI was the biggest benefactor from storms .Seems ultra risky to me, considering how cheap KMI is, they have to cover even if they buy it all up to 17-17.50This thing is only trading 6-7m a dayTHOSE SHORTS better get on their horses SOON!"

"The EL PASO explosion with 2 deaths, no reaction?"
"Gil,"
"My thoughts on earnings --- somewhat disappointed.Divi remains safe and debt is under control, BUT-- Taken aback by magnitude of asset impairment which is out of the blue. That blows!-- Lack of any quantified NET growth drivers is the problem. Earnings flat to slightly down for as far as I can see.-- Asset impairment suggests problems or at lest longer term concerns in their core operations in a key marketWas hoping for more positive longer term guidance.I change my opinion from buy to hold. Will remain for dividend as that is important to me, but not expecting much appreciation in share price Safe, stable, good income but a lack of growth prospects.An aside, I saw no indication of their buying any shares -- or did I miss something?Maybe they plan to engage this now and why year end debt targets are higher than I hoped?I am NOT a big fan of buybacks, but they do gain the divi cost for those shares acquired."
OH COME ON FOR CH$%&ST SAKES............so tired holding this for years and go nowhere.
Can anyone explain why the share price is so low when nat gas prices are so high?
Where's the guy who sold at 15.70 because he got emotional?
$16 looks like a buy.
Kinder Morgan (KMI) sees higher income in 2021 and raises it's dividend 3% to $1.08 per share (annualized) with a $450M share repurchase planned. 2020 net income for KMI was $100M due to large impairment write downs from pandemic demand reductions. Management sees 2021 generating about $2.1B in profit on core earnings of $6.8B and DCF of $4.4B. KMI expects to spend $800M next year on expansion projects and joint ventures. (Source: Reuters).
I have a 5k share GTC @ $15.50 in for months... since the Q1 EPS...Im hoping it fills...
"With the price of Natty well over 5 clams, KMI should jack costs to move products across their lines. You cant let the producers lick all the cream."
Al.... the board had KMI at a consensus buy at $15.50... you mocked it.. you missed out on 7+% in two days....Great call...
awesome stock :-)
"Everyone knows energy stocks are going to head higher. Kmi will go up a little more slowly, but I’m hanging on. Over the long term, the dividends will keep being paid. With share appreciation, we’ll all do fine, despite the setbacks of the last few years. Bullish."
"Missed the jump, is it too late?"
