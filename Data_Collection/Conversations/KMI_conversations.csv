Earning will be good. They will announce they aggressively bought back stock and adding more funds to buyback program. Also will say they retired more debt with improved earnings Dividend increase will be teased. Commitment to doc increase size will be vague but an increase fir sure.
"KMI always seems to fully participate to the downside but not the big up days -- for comparison, EPD was up 6% over the last two days but is down today less than KMI (which did not go up at all the last couple of days). Certainly some curious price action in KMI of late......"
I am thinking of adding at $15 just for div.
The most disappointing investment in my portfolio... never fails to underperform.
gonna add more shares in the am tomorrow...I like the dividend and share buy back program. near guarantee in the dividend at 5.7% yield...I think the market is going to correct 10% after the earnings season with the exception to high dividend players like KMI...
KMI can't be this bad can it?
"Now would be time to buy, no??? The big earnings quarter is starting now as we approach winter. The demand for natural gas will be unknown (depends on the weather) but the price of natural gas and oil will be higher because of inflation. The economies of the world are opening up so oil should be good through the summer of next year, I think. I've been wrong before in life. I don't know what to think anymore. Any thoughts out there? Buy KMI or not???"
"Breaking news, KMI management resigns. KMI increases to $40!"
Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) reported quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share . This is a 4.76 percent increase over earnings of $0.21 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $3.82 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.26 billion by 17.30 percent. This is a 31.00 percent increase over sales of $2.92 billion the same period last year.
"""protect the balance sheet""""the board will make that decision in December"" but i want to give you 1.25, we have the money etc...what else will we hear on the 20th ?"
"Everyone knows energy stocks are going to head higher. Kmi will go up a little more slowly, but I’m hanging on. Over the long term, the dividends will keep being paid. With share appreciation, we’ll all do fine, despite the setbacks of the last few years. Bullish."
70% of yesterday's trading volume was shorting. Having trouble holding price down.
"From the balance sheet, it does not appear that KMI bought back any shares during Q3 which is a bit surprising. The stock traded as low as $15.50 which would have seemed like a great time to buy back a few shares."
"Prime example of share price manipulation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buy, buy and buy."
Its only a matter of time before the midstreams start benefitting from the increase in energy prices.
What an absolutely beautiful dividend stock
"Missed! Q3 earnings, but gain still up 43.21% YTD. $KMI"

"If VA governor election goes Republican, will send a strong message to democrats their direction/ideas/platform is failing to resonate with the American people. And if inflation continues to rise especially with a harsh winter, rocketing prices at home and at the pump....will administration reverse course?Anyone think we would re-open our energy here in US and will that help KMI?"
i have fallen and i can't get up :-)
"I’m thinking 20 after earnings, if the winter is as cold as they say it’s going to be 21 by spring!!!"
"KMI can't go over $20 just like PFE can't go over $50, Wall Streets scammers have programmed the stock price already, the whole stock market is a scam"
I consider KMI a very solid holding. There is a great future ahead for this company.
"This is Kinder Morgan and why I think their cap ex is going to significantly increase. Probably the reason RK hasn’t made a buy in over a year. He typically bought on a regular basis. The dividend will be dependent on how much cash is needed. A lot of KMI’s pipeline system is 70 years old and is at the end of it’s life cycle. This is also related to the El Paso pipeline explosion and the pipeline failure in Texas. “Kinder Morgan was also cited by PHMSA for the following safety violations in 2011:• Failing to maintain updated maps showing pipeline locations;• Failing to test pipeline safety devices;• Failing to maintain proper firefighting equipment;• Failing to inspect its pipelines;• Failing to adequately monitor pipelines’ corrosion levels.According to a September 2013 article in The Wall Street Journal, a small research firm called Hedgeye Risk Management issued a report that criticized Kinder Morgan’s maintenance record. Hedgeye Risk Management’s Kevin Kaiser accused the company of cutting its pipeline maintenance spending “to a minimum.” Kaiser also accused Kinder Morgan of using those funds to “boost the cash it pays to shareholders and to the general partner that controls the company.”“We believe that Kinder Morgan’s high-level business strategy is to starve its pipelines and related infrastructure of routine maintenance spending in order to maximize distributable cash flow,” Kaiser stated in the report.”"
Buying more tomorrow if it does not run up
"Movin on. If KMI cant beat estimates in an environment with record high gas prices and a world wide shortage, when can they. GL"
Did someone send out a memo that KMI has THE LARGEST NG PIPELINE SYSTEM in the USSeriously... that has to be worth something at this time
"Dividend locked in,,,,,,,,,I can't remember when I first started buying [and selling] but It was shortly after the big drop from 50 or so and I have collected dividends for all those quarters since."
Lets just hope that earnings dont cause a selloff... In the real world KMI was the first report the large 1X gain from the TX storm back in Q1... they reduced debt by $1.4 Billion....And the stock tanked.... they were wonderful results... and whomever was selling them as horrible....
Will be interesting to see if they release a budget for next year as they release third quarter earnings.
"When energy prices went down many oil and gas stocks went down a lot, now the energy prices have gone up double and stocks seem don't go up at all, this market is a scam"
"""KMI also expects to end 2021 with a Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.0""hey hey maybe they'll get books as clean as EPDs one day"
Great news!! We get a 6% dividend with 8% inflation. We only lose 2% of our investment per year!
Flushed over a years worth of income in 1 day!
Fast Money panel loving KMI. Najarian says it s/b where it was 7 years ago.
Fair value is here if mgmt doesn't think it worthy of buybacks after a $ drop!
Consistently buying shares?Pete?Bought back their debt with YOUR promised dividend.For Pete’s sake!6% dividend. Hmmmm….for longs how does that .27 look vs .51 when RK promised 10% a year from his toll road that is I effected by oil prices?
Russian pipelines and midstreams doing well. Thank you mr pres.
Very slow and steady w/o any dynamics is the program. The forth quarter should be great but now $20 is out of the question. Just can’t hit a quinella with this stock but 6% is ok.
"My expectation is that KMI will break $20/sh when we get some sort of winter superstorm. We all know something is brewing that will cause the US gas infrastructure to be bottlenecked, causing spot prices to skyrocket. We all know that states have been quick to retire coal power and shifted to natural gas. Investments in solar/wind doesn't do anything when you have a massive winter storm icing up turbines and covering solar panels."
"Kim Dang, ""Our hub facilities in Houston and New York, which are more driven by refinery runs, international trade, and blending dynamics, have shown less recovery than our rack terminals versus the pre-pandemic levels. In our marine tanker business, we continue to experience weakness. However, we've recently seen increased customer interest.""Really, Dutch TTF Natural Gas is 6 times Henry Hub, that is 600% more for the same natural gas. Henry Hub natural gas is up 100% from last year, so demand is up.Does the KMI clown show have a plan to capitalize on the current up tick in the market?Cause there results don't show that, they may have been asleep."
KMI needs to build a big square pipeline from the major ports to push those containers far inland to terminals. Infrastructure!
Wow. At closing price yield now slightly over 6%. Time to pick up a few extra shares if one is so inclined.
Special dividend coming?
Looks as if shorties are starting to cover
Solid Q. Div.will go up in Jan. Balance Sheet fixed..Cheerleaders may be disapointed but Investors should be ok with the results.
What a beautiful long term dividend hold!
"Time to kick the dividend up to $1.25 as promised, if my memory serves me well, several years ago0."
Is Keen RK’s son in law?
"Results not bad, but there is disappointment that there is no dividend increase. Management fails to deliver what is ""promised."""
"Certainly $19 before end of year, possibly $20 but likely by Feb/ Mar. Any price gains after that will be short lived, but $20 should hold barring negative events."
"Would anyone like my 8,000 shares at 18.00??"
WOW
Well this is an overreaction.
Been in KMI for several years.Love those dividends ! Stock is looking to go higher
NG down .02 cents. KMI will take a big hit tomorrow.
3.5 million shares short of yesterdays volume.
Maybe a short squeeze coming.
If gas prices hold here for another 6 months kmi can rapidly reduce shares debt. Read past earnings where they make projections based on price per barrel. They used to use $50 per barrel. So extrapolate out at current or even if drops to say $63 a barrel that s whole lot of profit. I would love someone to check the math and come up with a rounding assumption on this.
This was a long time Cramer FAVORITE all the way from $40 to $15
"Too big of run up to earnings = sell the news. Looking to buy back in the 15-16’s…wait another quarter. Next time sell before earnings release. In the meantime, collect your divvy…be happy. GLTA"
Oh and Pete they bought back debt because they hit an iceberg named Junk Status as their CFO sat silent. But it paid off nicely as she got promoted for doing so.Pete makes it sound like they took profits and paid down debt cuz they are smart.In truth RK went on Mad Money and pushed something he couldn’t deliver on and didn’t admit it until he cut the div 75%+
Short 2400 shares
KMI earnings usually set the tempo for the rest of the industry pipes and tanks. What is the consensus here on earnings?
During the big freeze in Texas last winter KMI recorded large one time gains due to the spike in natgas prices. Current gas prices are up quite a bit. Why won't KMI have a similar opportunity for gains?
"Like you, disappointed in no div. increase. My take, ""we would if we could, but we can't so we won't"". Cash flow positive so maintaining not a problem in near term. Longer term, pretty positive for stock and div. increases. The world believes in ""green"", me too, about 25 years from now."
this should be $20+ a share?
What's with the spike in after hrs. price? Anyone with any insight?
I think another of people were expecting a he explosion in the report but there is a bit of a lag with regards to recent developments
Big beat coming
Hold on
Omg I just bought in today. Thats some Nancy Palosi level market timing there for me!!!
Lets hope they can talk up Elba Isle LNG in the CC...Even if its speculative expansion hype
Back up the truck!Kmi will beat top and bottom.
"For the people thinking oil is going to $100. Around 2016 the US started to import an increasing amount of Russian oil, increasing to record levels. The US was importing as much oil from Russia as from Saudi Arabia. That contributed to US producers scaling back. It’s going to take a little while to reverse that trend. It’s not a faucet you can just turn on. The government is helping by encouraging US production, but they can only do so much. When US producers ramp up, oil prices will likely fall. KMI has other problems that will cause it to under perform that have nothing to do with the price of oil."
"Just prior to COVID, KMI traded around $20...........in July KMI approached $20 again but failed to hold. Why is $20 so very difficult to achieve, seems stuck here at $17. Any comments?"
KMI is wanting to RUN!
"$1.08/ share div equates to 5.9% Tell me where you can get a near guaranteed return like this? This is not a growth Stock. If you want growth, you are in the wrong stock."
"Fast Money- Fast Pitch - Pete Narajian pitches KMI and said KMI should be $20 soon, all the guest 100$ agree with him, stock pop to $18.40-$18.50"
"Added some at 17.85. It'll come back, and great dividend"
is this dumping because of ex-divy day?
This should be at $20
Short sellers do not get the dividend but they move the share price down enough to handle it.
"1.25 years of dividends evaporated. Yup, Richard Kinder is a genius."
"I am a little upset that someone, I posted a post on here today about Green Energy and I came later to see what others thought and my post was gone. I went to another of my post and clicked on it and pulled my other post and it was gone. Now why or who would decide that for whatever reason they would do away with my post,,,,,,,,,,,,,GO KMI"
small miss on earnings but big surge in revenues. looks like an overreaction. how about the divvy?
"It was mentioned that there is now more pipeline competition going to Mexico. It obviously affected us. Also, our backlog wasn’t that expensive, all small investments and we did have downtime due to the fire so our third quarter didn’t seem to great and Wall Street didn’t care for any excuses. Lastly, Wall Street has a long memory of the dividend fiasco and so do I. Bring on the cold weather and let’s see what management does."
"BTW, Yesterday the Energy ETFs were down close to 2%, the remaining 4% Kmi owned."
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
"FYI: Zacks has lowered kmi to rank 2, now a ‘buy.’ It was a ‘strong buy,’ at rank 1. Everyone needs to know that Zacks only goes out 3 months. If you are ‘long,’ recommendations from all Wall Street firms don’t apply."
I AM STAYING IN.
Beat Rev’s (crushed)Beat Earnings but missed expectations by 2 centsTaken to the woodshed for nearly 6%. OUCH!
Lost entire year of Dividend on 1 day!!!
gas goes up for months....KMI barely moves.....gas goes down 6% and KMI plunges....
I'm buying more KMI shares in the AH if they announce a dividend hike... I'm hoping the dividend goes above 6.75% as it will make it comparable to other dividend players in the commodities sector...
"Hey, Kim Dang when will international get better for LNG? Dutch TTF 6 times Henery Hub. Wake up little Kimmy."
"Dropped 6% and the ex-divy date is Nov.2nd?Some BIG $ is saying,,,""no thanks""."
"Record high price for gas, highest oil price in years and KMI misses on earnings. That’s a huge disappointment!"
Oversold...I think this will pop tomorrow.
"KMI has dropped over 10% in past 10 days, after a fairly decent run up. Is this mainly due to the 2c miss on their EPS, or other things, and if so what are they?"
KMI loves red 
"If I buy more today, do I qualify for the dividend?"
Wonder if CNBC talking heads still have any say on kmi going to $20 share price?
"With the increase in natural gas demand, KMI will be a money machine. Great time to pick up a few more shares. Will be a great ride."
Let me get this straight. KMI down over 6% because of a .02 cent miss. Nothing but short the hello out of it. Great buying opportunity!!!!!!!!!!!!
Management is not up to the task of running the company in these current times. Kinder and Keen should sell the company. I was surprise we did not get a dividend increase.
Down 6%. Now is time for the analyst do their downgrades.
Love this dividend play!
"Why keep so much debt with no major projects going on? Pay the debt down faster, and shift the interest from the debt to a special dividend. Total dividend could get to 10% or more. That would help boost the price."
Natural gas king KMI now breaking out. Buy all you want below $20.
Still range bound from $15 to $19.Probably has an equal chance of going to $16 or $18.Wouldn't buy or add any more over $15.50.
"I would say KMI soiled the bed here…I think they did such a poor job of managing expectations that they deserve the criticism they are getting. Results aren’t awful but everyone gets caught up in the cost of oil and natural gas, remember, KMI only moves the commodity, they don’t make a margin on it.Going forward, they don’t seem to have much of a plan to transition to a different business model and not investing in anything that will move the needle. Just a utility that moves commodities around the company and pays shareholders 5% plus . (“They are who we thought they were”…Denny Green)Clearly they mailed the results and cc call in this quarter ."
"Did KMI firm up ER date, it shows tentative 10/19 on anything I am reading? Energy looks to be a good place to invest as oil prices are at 7 year highs......anyone else think $20 soon?"
Two cent per Qtr raise.Bump to $1.16/yr. maybe $1.15.RK wants to redeem himself in Coco’s eyes.
Should be announcing dividend soon !!
"Gotta be long KMI. Still buying. Immediate and mid term is bright bright bright. Longer term too, money will flow to the Natgas transport businesses and kmi is well positioned."
"Missed the jump, is it too late?"
Politics are keep pipes down. Our leadership is keeping pipes down.
Last week KMI price crossed 200 week and 21 week moving averages. A very bullish LT sign.
Last day to buy and get that juicy dividend . Bought a few this morning.
"Will be $24 next week on good numbers , guidance and dividend increase "
"Just another in a long line of negative Wall Street reactions to an earnings report that’s really not all that bad. Short term looks good for this equity; long term even better. Staying with it. Let the short termers get flushed out. In the meantime, I’ll take the dividend. Oil and natural gas are not going away."
Did RK just signal taking KMI private???
RK should of offered Pelosi's stock and we wouldn't be seeing these price actions; like Tesla and vast majority of other California Technology Firms have!!!
Rails move a lot of gas and crude and share price shows it.
4.1% increase in profit.....is that a problem....
"By the comments I'm reading today concerning KMI, this stock is looking much more interesting. There will be some tax selling in November and December."
"I’m starting to lose a bit of confidence here. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not selling, but my buy-on-weakness program that has been in effect for well over a year, is officially ON HOLD."
"Theres gotta be more volume of products pushed through those pipes, with NG between 5-6$. Processing facilities should be redlining and storage facilities over flowing. Producers had to step up their game somewhat even with the lack of capX. Earnings estimates will get trampled and upgrade will come.."
Just under 12 million shares were short yesterday trading volume. Covering very soon.
"Our stable cash flows and guiding philosophy create a compelling investment opportunity, as we remain committed to funding our expansion capital opportunities internally, maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividend increases and/or share repurchases,""---------------""The company's business model including fee-based long-term contracts, in conjunction with its network of transportation and storage operations, helped propel Kinder Morgan's performance...""-------------""With North American RNG demand projected to triple during the next two decades, we see a great deal of potential growth here that dovetails nicely with our interconnected network of assets and strong customer relationships..""---------------""Kinder Morgan said it will continue to benefit from growing global natural gas demand because its assets are well positioned to serve growing domestic markets and LNG export destinations such as Mexico."""
My brokerage account says KMI dividend is $0.31 !!!!From 0.27.
"For what its worth, Zacks raised KMI to a strong buy today. Article shows on yahoo finance (for KMI) if interested in reading. Tried to post a link but got deleted by the yahoo police."
"We’re all glad to hear thatRich Kinder remains at the top of Forbes Billionaire list for Houston at $7B, a 35% increase from last year."
"Never got close in price to Pre Covid levels, even though Huge Debt reduction and improved cash flows.Today's Analyst's are all Woke Players; couldn't find a real deal if they fell into it! Sad what this country is becoming!"
"Five years ago KMI was $22+. Income was lower, Debt was higher, Natural Gas price was lower, Oil price was lower, and the dividend was half of what it is now.Today KMI is $17.54. Please explain."
Zacks yesterday: KMI likely to top Q3 estimatesZacks today: KMI Q3 earnings lag estimatesZacks tomorrow: Pay no attention. Added on today’s dip and continue to reinvest the dividends for the next 5-10 years and not stressed over each quarterly report.
"Between all the misses, Congress grilling oil execs, and x-div, does anyone think kmi gets drug down under 17 very far in the first hour?I smell a trade opportunity in the morn."
Could be $20 by this time next year.
"Latest earnings report stated a decrease in DCF.This is a negative indicator for future dividend increases.Since KMI is a dividend stock,it lost 6%.Seems like an over reaction since the current dividend is well covered?"
