Still range bound from $15 to $19.Probably has an equal chance of going to $16 or $18.Wouldn't buy or add any more over $15.50.

"If I buy more today, do I qualify for the dividend?"
"Like you, disappointed in no div. increase. My take, ""we would if we could, but we can't so we won't"". Cash flow positive so maintaining not a problem in near term. Longer term, pretty positive for stock and div. increases. The world believes in ""green"", me too, about 25 years from now."
KMI's div. is pretty good. See pps of Williams and Enterprise has mirrored KMI's price drop in the past 5 days and month. So seems to be an industry problem.
"$1.08/ share div equates to 5.9% Tell me where you can get a near guaranteed return like this? This is not a growth Stock. If you want growth, you are in the wrong stock."
"KMI has dropped over 10% in past 10 days, after a fairly decent run up. Is this mainly due to the 2c miss on their EPS, or other things, and if so what are they?"
"With the increase in natural gas demand, KMI will be a money machine. Great time to pick up a few more shares. Will be a great ride."
"If VA governor election goes Republican, will send a strong message to democrats their direction/ideas/platform is failing to resonate with the American people. And if inflation continues to rise especially with a harsh winter, rocketing prices at home and at the pump....will administration reverse course?Anyone think we would re-open our energy here in US and will that help KMI?"
"For the people thinking oil is going to $100. Around 2016 the US started to import an increasing amount of Russian oil, increasing to record levels. The US was importing as much oil from Russia as from Saudi Arabia. That contributed to US producers scaling back. It’s going to take a little while to reverse that trend. It’s not a faucet you can just turn on. The government is helping by encouraging US production, but they can only do so much. When US producers ramp up, oil prices will likely fall. KMI has other problems that will cause it to under perform that have nothing to do with the price of oil."
is this dumping because of ex-divy day?
"Our stable cash flows and guiding philosophy create a compelling investment opportunity, as we remain committed to funding our expansion capital opportunities internally, maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividend increases and/or share repurchases,""---------------""The company's business model including fee-based long-term contracts, in conjunction with its network of transportation and storage operations, helped propel Kinder Morgan's performance...""-------------""With North American RNG demand projected to triple during the next two decades, we see a great deal of potential growth here that dovetails nicely with our interconnected network of assets and strong customer relationships..""---------------""Kinder Morgan said it will continue to benefit from growing global natural gas demand because its assets are well positioned to serve growing domestic markets and LNG export destinations such as Mexico."""
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
"I am a little upset that someone, I posted a post on here today about Green Energy and I came later to see what others thought and my post was gone. I went to another of my post and clicked on it and pulled my other post and it was gone. Now why or who would decide that for whatever reason they would do away with my post,,,,,,,,,,,,,GO KMI"

KMI loves red 
"By the comments I'm reading today concerning KMI, this stock is looking much more interesting. There will be some tax selling in November and December."
"Results not bad, but there is disappointment that there is no dividend increase. Management fails to deliver what is ""promised."""
