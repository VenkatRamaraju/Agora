"Another quarter, another miss on Revenues (but they did beat earnings numbers). Also ratcheted down forward guidance. What in the World is going on with MHK???"
"In the 10Q last quarter, there seems to be a decent amount of insider buying. In particular 202,000 shares purchased by Filip Balcaen, who is a director in the company, between $100 and $109. https://sec.report/CIK/0000851968/Insider-Trades"
"I bought 10k with an average price of $74.50, happened to me a few days ago with NKLA, was down $35000 grand, and the next day I was up $10 grand and sold it yesterday if I would have kept it with today closing price, I would have been up $40,000. Take my word MHK going to be on fire tomorrow. low $80""s my prediction, it was completely oversold. Good luck to all longs"
"MHK seems a great company, but this surprised me, I suspect they are hit by 'supply chain' like everyone else. I also wonder how much of their product comes from China. I'm just not investing in those companies any more."
"In the last 3 months, 13 ranked analysts set 12-month price targets for MHK. The average price target among the analysts is $95.55. Analysts compare their price target to the current market price of the stock to determine how much potential upside or downside movement there could be in the stock price."
"Price pull back continues on good, old, MHK. No news to account for correction except rising interest rates. Looks like some support on the chart around 265. I won't buy any more until it stabilizes."
"Number 1 flooring producer, thousands of homes & businesses flooded including carpet stores and nothing but crickets here. Curious."
"Way oversold, 500 million dollar share buy back will greatly benefit the share holders."
"I've managed and owned flooring stores for over 2 decades. Mohawk is on a slow decline. I won't do business with them anymore, if I can help it. I'm in FL, and the reps are awful. I haven't seen my hard surface rep once or twice in the last 5 years. My carpet rep only comes in when he wants a stock order."
Mohawk Industries is down 5.07% to 188.96
"Here is one of the big shorts of MHK They happen to be long for their customers but it look like they have shorted it lower for themselves. Blackrock has shorted 600,000 shares the proof is on the SC 13 G the difference between shares they own and the voting power is 600,000 that is what they have shorted. Not sure I would give them any money to invest fhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/MHK/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8688&guid=13888861&type=316or me when they are working against their customers long position"
Bought 10k with an average price of $74.50 on Thursday and as I predicted MHK will go up on Friday sold it all my holding @ $ 78. This company would be extremely volatile for a while but great for day trading if you have the stomach. will see what happens on Monday.
"Looking at the stellar last quarter results and all the positive analyst coverage from JPM, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc., this should be trading in mid 200’s soon.Company is trading at a very low Forward PE compared to others in the S&P500. Fundamentals for the business could not be better."
It will be interesting to see how the Board of Directors of Mohawk react & respond
"Well when you dont have product ready when you promise your distributors "" in stock"" hence disaster! Need new management!"
Unbelievable price on MHK!! Sold in September for 190 and change after buying right after the earnings miss!! The stock is down an astounding 47% from last December's high!! Incredible!! Stock is approaching a 4 year low (148 and change set in early 2016!!). Is this puppy a BARGAIN or what??
"Why is the stock getting CRUSHED today?? Down about 6 bucks, even though they had a price increase by Wells Fargo to 135!! What in the world is going on with this sell off?? Sooooo GLAD I sold Thursday evening!!"
Raymond James upgraded to buy with a $180 price target.
Listen to their earnings call. They are building up inventories for the surge in demand... This stock is moving.... P.S. There is no housing market slowdown....
I just picked up a few shares at 180 and change (very close to 180). This sell off is WAY overdone!!
Channel stuffing does not result in fictitious sales and missing money over the longer term. I expect the books to be clean provided they did not engage in further accounting shenanigans. There will be a civil fine which was the point behind we have ample liquidity.
"With homebuilding, home remodeling both up and low interest rates - Analyst upgrades across the board. Goldman $196; Truist $220; Barclays $191 and JPM $203. Good luck to all longs. This will be rewarding this year with such strong fundamentals."
Any Buyers of MHK at these levels??
Is that # correct 50 bucks a share earnings?
We just had a Silver Cross develop on MHK!! That's when the 20 day crosses the 50 day average to the upside!! Very bullish!!
"""The company intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit,"" Mohawk said in the filing.Moody's Investors Service said in a statement that allegations of ""channel stuffing and intentionally overproduced product are credit negative and suggest aggressive business practices and potential corporate governance weaknesses.""""However, because the company has good liquidity bolstered by recent debt offerings and the allegations will take time to litigate,"" Moody's said, ""there is no impact on the company's Baa1 senior unsecured rating and stable outlook."""
How can they pay interest on big debt? Why so much debt?
"“The Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a Class Action against the company, claiming it engaged in a ""fraudulent scheme to fabricate revenues through fictitious sales of products that were not delivered to customers and to conceal from investors the true reasons for the company's ballooning inventory"" between April 2017 and July 2019.”"
"Business should be firing on all cylinders with homebuilding and home remodeling both up - Analyst upgrades across the board. Price targets have been revised high: JPM $263, Barclays $235, Zacks $211. Good luck to all longs. This will be rewarding this year with such strong fundamentals."
"Absolutely Kissing myself all over for getting out of MHK at 221 and change BEFORE the HUGE earnings miss: The Calhoun, Georgia-based company said it had profit of $2.62 per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses and restructuring costs, were $3.51 per share.The results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.88 per share."
Going north of 210 by June. Price increases held and there are more on the way. Earnings will beat again.
"Najarian on CNBC (big options trader), just said 5000 Call options just sold for Nov. at strike price of 200 bucks. Very bullish indeed for goog, old, reliable, MHK!!"
After Elections it has been historically bad should I hold or sell then jump back in??

Where is the bottom on this? 118 looks good to me for a buy.
great stock on sale.... tariffs will go into effect on all Chinese imports by the end of this year and this will make mohawk products more attractive AND don't forget $500B stock buyback program. Read this: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4215699-mohawk-industries-cyclical-value-territory
"Mohawk Industries (MHK -6.2%) trades lower after Deutsche Bank says fraud allegations could impact the stock if witnesses corroborate the allegations.The firm notes testimony included in the most recent filing was from a previous logistics business analyst at MHK, who alleged fictitious sales."
Looks like $152.98 is where it is headed....if rates break above 1.(0 SHORT UTILITIES and Home builders!!!!!! XLU rolling over today.
"Just dumped my shares in MHK at 190 and change (recently purchased at 180 and change). Decided to take profits for two reasons: 1. Needed to raise King Cash for possible Market correction/collapse., 2. MHK has bounce markedly from its post earnings meltdown (no need to get greedy)."
I bought shares at $70. I wonder if I should sell it EOD or hold it.
