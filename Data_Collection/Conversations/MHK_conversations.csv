A day traders dream
"Just picked up a few shares of good, old, All American, MHK!! Stock is totally Bombed Out, with a 61% correction from the top!! Double bottom is trying to form, with MACD showing increased accumulation by the Big Boys. Can it go lower?? Sure it could, but I believe downside is limited!!"
Mohawk reached a 52 Week high at 149.91
"“The Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a Class Action against the company, claiming it engaged in a ""fraudulent scheme to fabricate revenues through fictitious sales of products that were not delivered to customers and to conceal from investors the true reasons for the company's ballooning inventory"" between April 2017 and July 2019.”"
How can they pay interest on big debt? Why so much debt?
So disappointing to hear the news. So will they have to restate their earnings for all these years?
Silver Cross will occur within the next few days as 20 day average intersects 50 day average. Another Bullish technical formation with MHK!!
SCALPED Today ! This has Received a Real MOHAWK Haircut !(Snicker)
Cooking books is a federal crime. $50 by end of week
SEC WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUTTA THEM IF THESE RUMORS TRUE THINK $LK....... from 50 somthing to Otc gonna be ugly
PE seems off. My calculation is that is more in the 10 range from MHK own annual report.
Damn I am loving this stock today.
MHK reached a 52 Week low at 96.44
Mohawk is up 11.60% to 92.97
"Why is the stock getting CRUSHED today?? Down about 6 bucks, even though they had a price increase by Wells Fargo to 135!! What in the world is going on with this sell off?? Sooooo GLAD I sold Thursday evening!!"
"Looked at the long term chart (2 years), and decided TODAY was the day to start accumulating a few shares in good, old, MHK. Like the dividend and its prospects going forward. Chart indicates it has legs to about 230 (which would be a very nice return at current levels)."
Picking up 9/21 calls. Expecting a break out as flooring demand increases dramatically.
Channel stuffing does not result in fictitious sales and missing money over the longer term. I expect the books to be clean provided they did not engage in further accounting shenanigans. There will be a civil fine which was the point behind we have ample liquidity.
"Why is the stock down so much today?? Downgrade?? Lennar news?? Oh, interest rates going up, of course!!"
MHK reached a 52 Week low at 57.51
"Najarian on CNBC (big options trader), just said 5000 Call options just sold for Nov. at strike price of 200 bucks. Very bullish indeed for goog, old, reliable, MHK!!"

"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found http://tradenow.xyz. They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
MHK is down -16.06% to 182.45
"I bought 10k with an average price of $74.50, happened to me a few days ago with NKLA, was down $35000 grand, and the next day I was up $10 grand and sold it yesterday if I would have kept it with today closing price, I would have been up $40,000. Take my word MHK going to be on fire tomorrow. low $80""s my prediction, it was completely oversold. Good luck to all longs"
Any Buyers of MHK at these levels??
$500MM buyback announced!

MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at 204.62

Even up with OZSC or stay long here!
Mohawk is up 4.97% to 102.27
$MHK Maintains Raymond James Financial Strong Buy USD 235 » USD 240 Target Raised by RBC Capital Underperform USD 134 » USD 154
I’m starting to average down. I think there is no need to rush into the stock. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is another round of selling (perhaps tax related) but I think the price will move back into the 170s next year.
Going north of 210 by June. Price increases held and there are more on the way. Earnings will beat again.
great stock on sale.... tariffs will go into effect on all Chinese imports by the end of this year and this will make mohawk products more attractive AND don't forget $500B stock buyback program. Read this: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4215699-mohawk-industries-cyclical-value-territory
fraudulent companies can not sustain this kind of gains better sell it now then never it's going to go bankrupt
Where is the bottom on this? 118 looks good to me for a buy.
MHK is up 6.17% to $123.45
"I've managed and owned flooring stores for over 2 decades. Mohawk is on a slow decline. I won't do business with them anymore, if I can help it. I'm in FL, and the reps are awful. I haven't seen my hard surface rep once or twice in the last 5 years. My carpet rep only comes in when he wants a stock order."
"Sooooooo GLAD I bought last week. Not sure if the stock picked up an upgrade this morning or if this is just a technical rally (stock above 20 day moving average again), but I'll take it!!"
MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at 189.11
I bought shares at $70. I wonder if I should sell it EOD or hold it.

We just had a Silver Cross develop on MHK!! That's when the 20 day crosses the 50 day average to the upside!! Very bullish!!
"Raymond James just reiterated at ""Outperform,"" yet lowers price target to $195 from $215"
"A SAVAGE beating to MHK in AH trading (down 14.4%), as we speak. Only FB is getting CRUSHED worse as far as I can see."
MHK cracks back ABOVE its 200 day moving average for the first time since July of 2018!! Very Bullish!!!
MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at $163.58
"Wow, from bad to worse! Tough quarter.. you could sense the C suite frustration when citing price pressures, margin and inflation. I wonder if a resolution to the China trade dispute would bring any resolve.. What y'all think?"
Just losing a lot of business to Shaw and others?
Mohawk is up 12.68% to 103.92
"Okay, they beat on both earnings ($2.53 per share), and revenues (2.45 Billion). Also gave good guidance looking forward!! I think the worst of this company's problems are behind it!! Stock up a very healthy 4 bucks in AH!!"
I couldn't find any news that would warrant the sell off after earnings and a 14.5 PE. What's going on here?
wheres all the posts updates?
"Way oversold, 500 million dollar share buy back will greatly benefit the share holders."
"Just dumped my shares in MHK at 190 and change (recently purchased at 180 and change). Decided to take profits for two reasons: 1. Needed to raise King Cash for possible Market correction/collapse., 2. MHK has bounce markedly from its post earnings meltdown (no need to get greedy)."
How can they screw up so bad when their products are in so much demand due to all the natural disasters.

I expect some profit taking from yesterday's run-up. The indices are not holding up
"What bothers me is that the company has had to write off 1.3 billion of goodwill, much of it I assume in 2008 when they had a non-recurring loss of $20.48 a share. YET, the Cheef Exec has held the position since 2001 and the chief operating officer has held the position since 2005. What does it take to get fired?"
What a deal! Gimme more! 
MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at 218.85
Listen to their earnings call. They are building up inventories for the surge in demand... This stock is moving.... P.S. There is no housing market slowdown....

GUYS LOOK WHAT HAPPENED WITH LK COFFEE. SECTOR DOESN'T APPRECIATE A FRAUDULENT COMPANY

MHK is down 17.91% to $124.01

Still down here? I’ll be buying more soon.
"With homebuilding, home remodeling both up and low interest rates - Analyst upgrades across the board. Goldman $196; Truist $220; Barclays $191 and JPM $203. Good luck to all longs. This will be rewarding this year with such strong fundamentals."
Looks like $152.98 is where it is headed....if rates break above 1.(0 SHORT UTILITIES and Home builders!!!!!! XLU rolling over today.
Where did all the shorts go? Where is that sub $60 LOL!!!!!! This is fun ;-)
Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern has now formed (began in early May). This SUPER Bullish chart formation portends a very big move in coming weeks. Stay tuned...
"I was thinking about buying good, old, dependable, MHK a few days ago. The Market meltdown froze me DEAD in my tracks along with the collapse in the home builders and the bad housing number we got yesterday. Soooooooooo GLAD I did not get back into MHK!! They are getting SLAUGHTERD in AH trading after missing earnings big time and missing revenues as well!! Its absolutely STUNNING how this stock is down about 58% or so no from its high in late 2017!!"
I created an account to see where all my shorts are (throwing up)? Back to 85 we go :)

Mohawk is down 5.70% to 102.32
ITS BEHAVING LIKE LUMBAR LIQUIDATORS
"Price pull back continues on good, old, MHK. No news to account for correction except rising interest rates. Looks like some support on the chart around 265. I won't buy any more until it stabilizes."
The shorts are getting squeeze hard today.
"Looking at the stellar last quarter results and all the positive analyst coverage from JPM, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc., this should be trading in mid 200’s soon.Company is trading at a very low Forward PE compared to others in the S&P500. Fundamentals for the business could not be better."

"Well when you dont have product ready when you promise your distributors "" in stock"" hence disaster! Need new management!"
"Decided to take profits in good, old, MHK a few minutes ago. Nice almost 13 point gain in just shy of a month's time. RSI still not near a top (70 or slightly above). However, with the move this stock has made from the recent bottom it just made sense to take my profits. Still think it has legs to 225 or so before things peter out. Good Luck!!"
"Another quarter, another miss on Revenues (but they did beat earnings numbers). Also ratcheted down forward guidance. What in the World is going on with MHK???"
"Mohawk Industries (MHK -6.2%) trades lower after Deutsche Bank says fraud allegations could impact the stock if witnesses corroborate the allegations.The firm notes testimony included in the most recent filing was from a previous logistics business analyst at MHK, who alleged fictitious sales."
just opened a position. this foolishness has gone on too long.
"lawsuits are coming... CFO ""retired"" so to avoid jail. They will find him...."
MONDAY COMES AND WILL SEE 50S
Booming today 
"Looks like a decent report, not too optimistic. Looks like my strangle is good thus far."
Shorts have really gotten quiet LOL!!!!!
EPS 49.9 and the price is 120 !!What’s the wrong ?
They had some interesting insights about MHK on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Mohawk once sent me truckload of pad. Rolls are 6x45'. The entire shipment was 6' x 38'. They were severely shorting me on material. I had to file a claim. It doesn't surprise me one bit, the Mohawk intended to defrauded their customers. I don't buy much from them, if I can help it. Shaw and Dreamweaver are much better suppliers."
buy or sell after bad earnings
"Holy Toledo, yesterday's Fake Out hits shorts HARD with today's breakout!!! Didn't know the reason for yesterday's Fake Out, so I couldn't get back in!! Anyway, hats off to all who held on!!"

MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at $124.06
"I can see MHK hit the $60.00 mark…no management, confusion at the middle level since the good old boys managers are doing what ever they want (a lot of golf) and EMSER TILE is taking the market share."
"Not sure WHY MHK was downgraded but used weakness to reenter the stock around 245.70. MHK should do tremendous business during the next 6 months with MASSIVE orders for carpeting in Houston and SE TX, large portions of FL., and now Puerto Rico!!"
"Oh boy, this is probably just the beginning. Fictitious sales is a given here. And phony inventory on top of that. Just those 2 items will certainly mean redo earnings, on top of the other accusations. What the heck were they thinking."
"""The company intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit,"" Mohawk said in the filing.Moody's Investors Service said in a statement that allegations of ""channel stuffing and intentionally overproduced product are credit negative and suggest aggressive business practices and potential corporate governance weaknesses.""""However, because the company has good liquidity bolstered by recent debt offerings and the allegations will take time to litigate,"" Moody's said, ""there is no impact on the company's Baa1 senior unsecured rating and stable outlook."""
"As a retired Mohawk 30 year employee living in Florida, I have bought flooring three times in four years. Once due to Hurricane Michael. I have tried to buy Mohawk products each time, but they have very poor sales representation in a major city such as Tallahassee and dealers are not stocking their samples nor pushing their products to consumers. I am buying over $10k worth of engineered flooring this week, and three dealers are steering me to other products. Mohawk needs to look at sales leadership. Their once dominant name has lost it's luster."
"MHK seems a great company, but this surprised me, I suspect they are hit by 'supply chain' like everyone else. I also wonder how much of their product comes from China. I'm just not investing in those companies any more."
I just picked up a few shares at 180 and change (very close to 180). This sell off is WAY overdone!!
SELL IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE RETAIL INVESTORS
THEY WILL SUSPEND REPORTING DUE TO SECTOR INVESTIGATION
Obvious
Just got a nice tip from (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at 214.47
GOING TO THE RED ZONE.
Cooking books is a federal crime. $40 by end of month
Mohawk is down 5.27% to 112.32
strong competition from Floor&Decor...
"In the last 3 months, 13 ranked analysts set 12-month price targets for MHK. The average price target among the analysts is $95.55. Analysts compare their price target to the current market price of the stock to determine how much potential upside or downside movement there could be in the stock price."
Now need to look for any insider selling the past two or three years - clawback?What happens to the CEO and other insiders - incredible game playing?Also millions were taken out in salaries every year.
CRASHING AFTER HOURS DUE TO SECTOR INVESTIGATION
SECTOR INVESTIGATION. NOT A GOOD SIGN. WILL CRASH FURTHER.
Raymond James upgraded to buy with a $180 price target.
It will be interesting to see how the Board of Directors of Mohawk react & respond
"Absolutely Kissing myself all over for getting out of MHK at 221 and change BEFORE the HUGE earnings miss: The Calhoun, Georgia-based company said it had profit of $2.62 per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses and restructuring costs, were $3.51 per share.The results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.88 per share."
Bought Nov. 20 options at $80. Thoughts?
This stock is the canary in the coal mine for things to come in the overall market..Watch and see. This stock called the start of the 2007 drop around 6 months prior to the start.. I can't believe not many people see that.
MHK reached a new 52 Week Low at $149.98
Is that # correct 50 bucks a share earnings?
Unbelievable price on MHK!! Sold in September for 190 and change after buying right after the earnings miss!! The stock is down an astounding 47% from last December's high!! Incredible!! Stock is approaching a 4 year low (148 and change set in early 2016!!). Is this puppy a BARGAIN or what??
"Number 1 flooring producer, thousands of homes & businesses flooded including carpet stores and nothing but crickets here. Curious."
Mohawk is up 11.31% to 85.24
"Just unloaded it in AH at 136 and change!! I KNEW they would beat that low bar!! I would have held into tomorrow, but with the Trade Talk problems, AND the fact the SPY and IWM are still up about 14-15% off the bottom, we could see additional selling on Friday!! Also, AH trading can be quite magnified, so better to take your profits and go Home!!!"
"Wow, revenue is the same with market cap. so cheap, too bad no dividend for shareholders"
MHK reached a 52 Week low at 59.24
"Isn't this old news, already discounted?"
Mohawk is up 4.93% to 123.00

Mohawk Industries is down 5.07% to 188.96
"If this company can't shine in good times, what will happen when construction freezes ?"
Going to 20 dollars. lawsuits up the roof. small company like this can't survive this kind of pressure. sell and get out. i did. took a loss and moved on
"In January, the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a lawsuit claiming accounting fraud at Mohawk. The suit did not get a lot of attention at the time, but new filings submitted in late June add significant details about the allegations and have gotten Wall Street's attention.According to analysts, the filing includes testimony from a former Mohawk employee who claims the company has used fictitious sales to artificially boost revenue since 2017."
I think the bar is sooooo LOW on MHK they will handily beat on both earnings and revenues!!!
JPM analyst is smart... 1. Tell to underweight... 2. Buy at 3x P/B business which earns billions in profit... 3. Sell later at $250 per share....
Big change yesterday in management... new President of North American Flooring...
Sell
"""we've delivered results on the higher end of expectations...."" good!"
Oil has come down a lot. Transportation costs are probably under control by now. It's time to reduce the share count.
"Business should be firing on all cylinders with homebuilding and home remodeling both up - Analyst upgrades across the board. Price targets have been revised high: JPM $263, Barclays $235, Zacks $211. Good luck to all longs. This will be rewarding this year with such strong fundamentals."
Mohawk is down 9.25% to 87.56
"HUGE really today on good, old, All American, no nonsense, kick butt and take names, MHK!! Double whammy against those shorting the Market today: Tremendous over 300K jobs report, increasing hourly wages, and don't forget Fed Chairman (Uncle Powell), soothing Market fears this morning. Anyway, looks like the FINAL bottom has been put in on MHK. I could be wrong but My Lord how much lower could it go??? Chart looking much healthier then just a few days ago today!!!"
MHK is up 6.40% to $132.71
"I sold today not worth the risk for a loss ,I think it will test the 50 range then I may look at again so many more good companys, then a company with a lawsuit ,do not want to throw good money away for nothing"
Is Mohawk making Luxury Vinyl Tile. ( waterproof flooring )? It is very popular in my area.

MHK reached a 52 Week low at 80.43
After Elections it has been historically bad should I hold or sell then jump back in??
"Here is one of the big shorts of MHK They happen to be long for their customers but it look like they have shorted it lower for themselves. Blackrock has shorted 600,000 shares the proof is on the SC 13 G the difference between shares they own and the voting power is 600,000 that is what they have shorted. Not sure I would give them any money to invest fhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/MHK/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8688&guid=13888861&type=316or me when they are working against their customers long position"
"wow, usually these types of stocks are a sign of what's to come.."
Not good
Mohawk reached a 52 Week high at 155.93
stock has gone from $280 to $70 in 2-1/2 years. Does not look good for future investors especially with the directors and officers being charged with fraud. Sounds like another Enron on the way.
Mohawk is up 7.73% to 111.17
Stock is down nearly 20% from its high. Believe this is a good buying opportunity.
"MHK needs to start paying a dividend, PERIOD! An absolute blood bath with a quality stock. This is a joke!"
Bought 10k with an average price of $74.50 on Thursday and as I predicted MHK will go up on Friday sold it all my holding @ $ 78. This company would be extremely volatile for a while but great for day trading if you have the stomach. will see what happens on Monday.
"In the 10Q last quarter, there seems to be a decent amount of insider buying. In particular 202,000 shares purchased by Filip Balcaen, who is a director in the company, between $100 and $109. https://sec.report/CIK/0000851968/Insider-Trades"
Just learning about MHK now... reading a quick profile my main concern is what stops AMZN from simply producing an Amazon basics line to out compete MHK's products? Seems like AMZN itself could be their main competitor? If true in an antitrust scenario MHK could be an interesting play and of course companies like SHOP that have fended off competition from the mothership have done really well. Would appreciate thoughts/links on this.
