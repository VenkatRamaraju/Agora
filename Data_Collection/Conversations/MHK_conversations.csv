"Isn't this old news, already discounted?"
"Way oversold, 500 million dollar share buy back will greatly benefit the share holders."
wheres all the posts updates?
PE seems off. My calculation is that is more in the 10 range from MHK own annual report.
After Elections it has been historically bad should I hold or sell then jump back in??

"“The Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a Class Action against the company, claiming it engaged in a ""fraudulent scheme to fabricate revenues through fictitious sales of products that were not delivered to customers and to conceal from investors the true reasons for the company's ballooning inventory"" between April 2017 and July 2019.”"
"Sooooooo GLAD I bought last week. Not sure if the stock picked up an upgrade this morning or if this is just a technical rally (stock above 20 day moving average again), but I'll take it!!"
What a deal! Gimme more! 
Now need to look for any insider selling the past two or three years - clawback?What happens to the CEO and other insiders - incredible game playing?Also millions were taken out in salaries every year.
I just picked up a few shares at 180 and change (very close to 180). This sell off is WAY overdone!!
I created an account to see where all my shorts are (throwing up)? Back to 85 we go :)
Just losing a lot of business to Shaw and others?
MHK is up 6.17% to $123.45
stock has gone from $280 to $70 in 2-1/2 years. Does not look good for future investors especially with the directors and officers being charged with fraud. Sounds like another Enron on the way.
Just got a nice tip from (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"Not sure WHY MHK was downgraded but used weakness to reenter the stock around 245.70. MHK should do tremendous business during the next 6 months with MASSIVE orders for carpeting in Houston and SE TX, large portions of FL., and now Puerto Rico!!"
"Looking at the stellar last quarter results and all the positive analyst coverage from JPM, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc., this should be trading in mid 200’s soon.Company is trading at a very low Forward PE compared to others in the S&P500. Fundamentals for the business could not be better."
Where is the bottom on this? 118 looks good to me for a buy.
"Mohawk once sent me truckload of pad. Rolls are 6x45'. The entire shipment was 6' x 38'. They were severely shorting me on material. I had to file a claim. It doesn't surprise me one bit, the Mohawk intended to defrauded their customers. I don't buy much from them, if I can help it. Shaw and Dreamweaver are much better suppliers."
"What bothers me is that the company has had to write off 1.3 billion of goodwill, much of it I assume in 2008 when they had a non-recurring loss of $20.48 a share. YET, the Cheef Exec has held the position since 2001 and the chief operating officer has held the position since 2005. What does it take to get fired?"

strong competition from Floor&Decor...
"Stock Market WAY Overbought and Overvalued!! However, throwing caution to the wind and buying back into MHK (sold awhile back for about 250 or so). With housing stocks doing well, and businesses spending more bucks do to President Trump and Republican tax bill, MHK should do EXTREMELY Well. If correction does rear its head, will buy more MHK. Don't like these stellar prices but there is nothing else you can do (besides a split could be announced at ANY time)."
Reverse Head and Shoulders pattern has now formed (began in early May). This SUPER Bullish chart formation portends a very big move in coming weeks. Stay tuned...

"I can see MHK hit the $60.00 mark…no management, confusion at the middle level since the good old boys managers are doing what ever they want (a lot of golf) and EMSER TILE is taking the market share."
"MHK needs to start paying a dividend, PERIOD! An absolute blood bath with a quality stock. This is a joke!"
"Why is the stock getting CRUSHED today?? Down about 6 bucks, even though they had a price increase by Wells Fargo to 135!! What in the world is going on with this sell off?? Sooooo GLAD I sold Thursday evening!!"
Still down here? I’ll be buying more soon.

"If this company can't shine in good times, what will happen when construction freezes ?"
"Looked at the long term chart (2 years), and decided TODAY was the day to start accumulating a few shares in good, old, MHK. Like the dividend and its prospects going forward. Chart indicates it has legs to about 230 (which would be a very nice return at current levels)."

"In January, the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi filed a lawsuit claiming accounting fraud at Mohawk. The suit did not get a lot of attention at the time, but new filings submitted in late June add significant details about the allegations and have gotten Wall Street's attention.According to analysts, the filing includes testimony from a former Mohawk employee who claims the company has used fictitious sales to artificially boost revenue since 2017."

"Just dumped my shares in MHK at 190 and change (recently purchased at 180 and change). Decided to take profits for two reasons: 1. Needed to raise King Cash for possible Market correction/collapse., 2. MHK has bounce markedly from its post earnings meltdown (no need to get greedy)."
"I bought 10k with an average price of $74.50, happened to me a few days ago with NKLA, was down $35000 grand, and the next day I was up $10 grand and sold it yesterday if I would have kept it with today closing price, I would have been up $40,000. Take my word MHK going to be on fire tomorrow. low $80""s my prediction, it was completely oversold. Good luck to all longs"
Channel stuffing does not result in fictitious sales and missing money over the longer term. I expect the books to be clean provided they did not engage in further accounting shenanigans. There will be a civil fine which was the point behind we have ample liquidity.
Big change yesterday in management... new President of North American Flooring...
"Number 1 flooring producer, thousands of homes & businesses flooded including carpet stores and nothing but crickets here. Curious."
A day traders dream

Double whammy against those shorting the Market today: Tremendous over 300K jobs report, increasing hourly wages, and don't forget Fed Chairman (Uncle Powell), soothing Market fears this morning. Anyway, looks like the FINAL bottom has been put in on MHK. I could be wrong but My Lord how much lower could it go??? Chart looking much healthier then just a few days ago today!!!"
"recovery began. housing rates and starts, new products and factories and markets (not to mention any natural disasters like Katrina) will push this stock to $300+"

Oil has come down a lot. Transportation costs are probably under control by now. It's time to reduce the share count.

"Here is one of the big shorts of MHK They happen to be long for their customers but it look like they have shorted it lower for themselves.

"Stock hasn't been this low in 6 years. You would have thought this stock would have have held up better after earnings, especially since its been so punished in recent months. They need to pay some kind of dividend here!!"
Why is this dropping so bad?
SEC WILL MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUTTA THEM IF THESE RUMORS TRUE THINK $LK....... from 50 somthing to Otc gonna be ugly
They had some interesting insights about MHK on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
SELL IT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE RETAIL INVESTORS
JPM analyst is smart... 1. Tell to underweight... 2. Buy at 3x P/B business which earns billions in profit... 3. Sell later at $250 per share....
So disappointing to hear the news. So will they have to restate their earnings for all these years?

"""The company intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit,"" Mohawk said in the filing.Moody's Investors Service said in a statement that allegations of ""channel stuffing and intentionally overproduced product are credit negative and suggest aggressive business practices and potential corporate governance weaknesses.""""However, because the company has good liquidity bolstered by recent debt offerings and the allegations will take time to litigate,"" Moody's said, ""there is no impact on the company's Baa1 senior unsecured rating and stable outlook."""
Just learning about MHK now... reading a quick profile my main concern is what stops AMZN from simply producing an Amazon basics line to out compete MHK's products? Seems like AMZN itself could be their main competitor? If true in an antitrust scenario MHK could be an interesting play and of course companies like SHOP that have fended off competition from the mothership have done really well. Would appreciate thoughts/links on this.

Earnings, adjusted for pretax expenses and restructuring costs, were $3.51 per share.The results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.88 per share."

"As a retired Mohawk 30 year employee living in Florida, I have bought flooring three times in four years. Once due to Hurricane Michael. I have tried to buy Mohawk products each time, but they have very poor sales representation in a major city such as Tallahassee and dealers are not stocking their samples nor pushing their products to consumers. I am buying over $10k worth of engineered flooring this week, and three dealers are steering me to other products. Mohawk needs to look at sales leadership. Their once dominant name has lost it's luster."
