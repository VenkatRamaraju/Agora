"read this article in Marketbeat today....Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE:CLDR) Insider Sells $8,443,740.03 in Stock @ $21.41 / share....must be wrong...but math checks."
"Don’t panic , be patient. Expect a mini selloff in the morning from the weak hands then a uptick throughout the day. This will finish above 12 dollars at the end of the day. The company has Great fundamentals and balance sheet. Market Cap only 3.5x revenues, leaves huge room for stock price appreciation. The after hour downfall in prices was based on the CEO giving a very honest and underwhelming guidance which factored in the current pandemic climate. It was unfair for the market to punish this stock for that while a lot of other companies withdrew there guidance from the year and still got a bounce in the stock. Earnings will be positive by end of year and subscribers/ revenues have increased year on year."
I dont want to sell cldr this year due to taxable income. Possible to sell my shares next year?
What happened to the shares once its sold out. Will it be just sold as 16 and cashed out?
"Could Salesforce be interested in Cloudera? First Published: Nov. 30, 2020 at 12:48 p.m. ETBy Daniel NewmanSalesforce will need to add businesses if it truly seeks to increase its competitiveness as an enterprise platform.Microsoft, Google and Oracle, which are all staunchly competitive with Salesforce in different aspects, all offer one critical capability that Salesforce does not: A full-stack cloud infrastructure service that acts as the foundation for enterprise digital transformation.Salesforce still depends on third-party clouds for housing data and building connectivity to vast employee and customer data that lives outside its platform. Even deep integrations with cloud providers that are less directly competitive to Salesforce, such as Amazon’s AWS, don’t necessarily provide it with the same ability to control the entire user/customer experience the way its competitors can by using their own clouds to fully manage and control all data sources inside the organization and beyond.Salesforce will need to fully address the absence of a cloud infrastructure offering to stack up against Microsoft, Google and Oracle. The challenge will be a lack of quick entry options through acquisition, meaning the likely approach for Salesforce would be to build organically and scale by drafting off the larger infrastructure players.For instance, right now, Salesforce uses preferred cloud relationships for its various apps. AWS for its core CRM, and Azure for its Marketing Cloud. To maximize revenue, and overtime profit, Salesforce would be best served to build its own infrastructure, then scale out using third-party data center hosts such as Equinix to minimize build-out costs but maintain full control of the data and customer environment. This has been the approach of Oracle and IBM, and it wouldn’t be an overnight process.Still, it would be a critical step to fully compete with those that offer the entire cloud stack of infrastructure, platform and enterprise software. Cloud infrastructure is something that many would never have expected from Salesforce, but it’s potentially its biggest challenge and opportunity to unlock its next level of growth.Daniel Newman is the principal analyst at Futurum Research, which provides or has provided research, analysis, advising, and/or consulting to Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and dozens of companies in the tech and digital industries."
Thinking of the likely chance to see my avg @ 18 :)))
It is clear by the activity that there must be another bid above 16! Yay baby! Let’s go!
Good news is that I have now more than doubled my position lowering cost to $10.60/share on a weighted average basis. Second half will be exciting with new comprehensive product. All the weak hands have been washed out and so momentum will build after earnings are behind us and investors focus on future growth.
When's the new offer?
"The predicted price for CLDR in the upcoming period, according to Northland Capital is $45."

Cloudera falls after getting no other offers in go-shop periodJul. 07, 2021 9:46 AM ETCloudera, Inc. (CLDR)By: Josh Fineman, SA News Editor1 CommentCloudera (NYSE:CLDR) dropped 2.2% after disclosing that it received no alternative offers in its go-shop period after agreeing to $5.3B sale to private equity buyers last month.Cloudera banker Morgan Stanley reached to 17 parties to invite them to the go-shop process and all of parties indicated they weren't interested in a bid, according to a regulatory filing from last night. The go-shop expired at 11:59pm on July 1."
"SummaryShares of Cloudera have dropped ~25% from recent peaks notched in August.The company has executed incredibly well during the pandemic, with subscription revenues continuing to grow in the high-teens.Cloudera's high mix of recurring revenue gives it plenty of stability amid a pandemic that has been challenging for infrastructure software companies.The possibility of a Cloudera acquisition is another factor that will put a floor on the stock price.Shares look cheaply valued at ~3x forward revenues.I do much more than just articles at Daily Tech Download: Members get access to model portfolios, regular updates, a chat room, and more. Get started today »Cloudera (CLDR) has rarely been any investor's favorite stock in the software sector, but at current levels, the company's dirt-cheap valuation is just too cheap to ignore. Since its 2017 IPO, Cloudera has routinely failed to bring its market value back to the ~$4 billion it was worth when it was a private company - even after completing a rare merger of equals (something that almost never happens in the software sector) with longtime rival Hortonworks and creating a genuine leadership niche in the enterprise Hadoop space.Along with virtually every other software and tech stock so far in the month of September, Cloudera has suffered its fair share of losses in the month to date - never mind the fact that the stock was already cheap to begin with. Since the company's August peak at just shy of $14 per share, shares of Cloudera have technically entered a new bear market, with the stock down ~25%:ChartData by YChartsThere's no doubt that investors need a strong stomach to invest in Cloudera. This is a stock that has routinely disappointed and underperformed not only its peer SaaS stocks (while many of Cloudera's peers have doubled their stock prices this year, Cloudera is one of the few tech stocks that is actually down year to date), but even the broader market. Yet for investors who can turn a blind eye to the near term and invest in Cloudera for both its long-term value and its technology assets, this is a good low-risk way to maintain exposure to the tech sector without risking overpaying for overheated SaaS stocks.Investors should be aware of the following about Cloudera:Since June, Cloudera has been the subject of heated acquisition rumors. Nothing concrete has surfaced here yet, but whenever a unique and compelling technology like Cloudera is ""on sale"" as its current valuation suggests, there's bound to be window shoppers. The possibility of M&A, in my view, puts an effective floor on Cloudera's share price from sinking too low. Cloudera is an ideal target for a long-term, software-focused PE buyer like Thoma Bravo - a firm that specializes in taking on modestly valued, recurring revenue software companies and tightening their operations to create a profit machine.So far in the year to date, Cloudera has executed well in the pandemic environment. Many other infrastructure software companies are struggling to sustain their revenue growth during the coronavirus-impacted summer months, but Cloudera's most recent Q2 results (which we'll look at in this article) show resilience.Cloudera has recently released a new private cloud solution, named Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Private Cloud. Not every company wants to house their infrastructure in the cloud. Cloudera's new offering will help tp penetrate the market for hybrid/on-premise deployments.Big data and Hadoop are very topical areas to invest in. Cloudera's framework helps companies manage very large and complex datasets. With the corporate world continuing to view data as one of their chief assets, data management tools like Cloudera will become increasingly critical.At Cloudera's current share prices near $11, the company trades at a $3.29 billion market cap. After netting off the $565.4 million of cash on Cloudera's balance sheet (another reason to like Cloudera - quite an impressive and debt-free load of cash), the company's enterprise value is just $2.72 billion.Wall Street, meanwhile, has a $931.9 revenue consensus for the next fiscal year FY22, indicating 10% y/y growth. Against this revenue view, Cloudera trades at just 2.9x EV/FY22 revenues. Considering that Cloudera is currently growing subscription revenues at a mid-teens pace (and pre-pandemic, growth was in the low 20s), I'd say this is quite a bargain stock to consider investing in."
"This stock has a ways to go in my opinion. I'm looking for somewhere between 10 and 15 billion in the short term. Looks like growth is the main difference between this company and the likes of SNOW, DDOG, and DataBricks when comparing valuations. Growth is accelerating though and I don't believe the analyst estimates reflect that. CLDR currently has the most revenue and is the only company out of this group that is profitable. It will be interesting to watch these companies going forward. I fully expect CLDR to tighten the gap in mkt cap. SNOWMKT Cap 85BThis Year's Revenue $580MEstimated Top Line Growth 90%DDOGMKT Cap 34BThis Year's Revenue $831Estimated Top Line Growth 28%DataBricksValuation 28BRevenue $425MCLDRMKT Cap 5.5BThis Year's Revenue $864MEstimated Top Line Growth 10%"
"Beat Massively From Top to Bottom, Beat All Revenue sector estimates from Subscription Revenue to Enterprise Deal. Profitable at Non-GAAP at $0.10 EPS. Raised Full Year Revenue and Earning Guidance Significantly. This is one of best SaaS companies earnings reports I had seen this quarter, certainly the best quarter for Cloudera. Considering it is extremely undervalued stock before the Earning, the potential room for Stock Price Appreciation is enormous. There is a real chance the stock price would get some tailwind from a potential IBM or Oracle acquisition since Cloudera big data analytics model is what those Tech major are lacking and would like to add for their product package. I see this stock trading above $20s in month."
"I see that the person calling for a buyout of Cloudera to be announced this weekend and telling people to purchase Jan $15 calls for $.07 to make $6+ has deleted his posts. No need to be promoting fake rumors as the company will do fine without those rumors. All Cloudera needs to do is keep coming out with new products and services, beating their quarter earnings as they have for more than a year and they will be purchased eventually. Just a matter of time. CLDR is a $40 stock trading at a discount at $12.68"
"""Cloudera is a provider of cloud-based big data solutions. The firm delivers an open-source distribution platform that enables efficient and secure data management and analytics. Cloudera is also focused on being scalable across large organizations, and its client list includes Facebook.This stock has been a bit of a rollercoaster since debuting in April 2017, but a clear path closer to profitability and strong revenue growth make this look attractive right now. Per share losses are expected to improve 46% in the current fiscal year, and the company has a long-term projected earnings growth rate of 8%. Earnings estimates have also been revised higher recently, lifting CLDR to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).""And some weak hands were still selling? Learn to HOLD for bigger $$$ Profit!"
"Watched the demo of new hybrid (cloud & on-prems) CDP product, it is quite exciting. I would say that it is innovative, comprehensive, secure and performant, and has a huge potential as no other company offers this kind of product at the moment. I am pretty sure it will receive a lot of interest from its thousands of current customers that are using Hadoop on-prems. It will be available in late August, pretty much inline with new CEO onboarding. Will see a great success."
"I'll guess that $15.50 will be the bottom and we should see the SP creep back up as we approach the closing of the acquisition. If you buy at $15.50 you'll get a 3.25% return and will only have to wait a few months so I don't see Cloudera falling below that, at least not for long."
"I’ve held hoping for another offer but it appears that’s a pipe dream…. Anyone know the date the deal closes? For the few cents , I would just assume her my cash into something else if another offer is ruled out..,, ty"
"In June, I put my life saving into CLDR 20000 shares at 5.10. This is a long term play for me. I plan to hold for at least 5 quarters. All or none for me. No retirement, no 401k, nothing. I'm swing for the fences."
"Yes, CLDR has had a rough few days after reporting. However, CLDR is greatly undervalued. Here is some proof:Snowflake, Inc., the cloud-based big data company, revealed in its amended S-1 filing on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway agreed to take a stake in its class A shares in a private placement.The company said Salesforce Ventures and Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $250 million worth of its Class A common shares in a private placement at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price.Snowflake, which is taking the route of a traditional IPO, expects to list its shares at a price range between $75 and $85.“Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $80.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, each of Salesforce Ventures and Berkshire Hathaway would purchase 3,125,000 shares of our class A common stock,” the filing said."
"CLDR stock movement is testing the patience of longs. Up a little, down a little and today up and then down on a big positive day. Looks like manipulation, trying to get retail longs to lose patience and sell out. As for me, I added recently and waiting for one of a few positive catalysts. Thoughts."
"ClouderaFinding a company involved in the cloud that's valued at less than 10 times sales is practically impossible. The coronavirus pandemic demonstrated how important online and cloud access are for businesses, which coerced investors to pay insane multiples. But one intriguing name slipped through the cracks: Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR).The thing about Cloudera is that it wasn't always a cloud company. Over roughly the past year, it's moved away from its legacy data platform and has pushed its new hybrid Private Cloud and Public Cloud offerings. This ongoing transformation allows the company to generate cash flow from its legacy operations, while also transitioning these enterprise customers into higher-margin, cloud-native platforms. In the October-ended quarter, subscription revenue jumped 18% from the prior-year period.With sales growth likely to exceed Wall Street's expectations in calendar year 2021, and the company valued at just over 4 times forward-year sales, Cloudera has plenty of reason to rocket higher this year."
We have seen a steady improvement in the last couple of quarters. I am excited for the ER after hours after seeing the move from other software stocks after ER this week. I also saw a graphic on CNBC and shows the multiples of a few software companies. CLDR was relatively low compared to the other two. I expect good numbers and I expect a spike after hours and tomorrow and we will not see $11 anymore! Going out on a limp. God Bless and stay well.
"Low volume, slightly down, tennis match all morning, back and forth. Not the bump expected from great IBM ER. I always thought where there is smoke there is fire as it relates to the connection between IBM and CLDR, but I guess in this case smoke is just smoke. Disappointing for sure."
anyone read this article? excellent CNN Business Exclusive: 109 year-old IBM is planning to take on Amazon. Here's howI think CLDR is their target.
Don’t forget Cloudera is only trading at 4X sales. That is really low for this sector especially since Cloudera is also generating a lot of cash flow. That could look very appealing to a company looking to expand its footprint in the cloud sector.
July 1st isn’t necessarily the end of the Go Shop period. If a new offer is made Cloudera has another 10 days to finalize the deal. We could still get news of a higher offer several days after July 1st.
"This needs to go up another buck. One real positive note, these guys really don't have a ton of debt. This earnings will be interesting"
"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the enterprise data cloud company, reported results for its second quarter of fiscal 2021, ended July 31, 2020. Total revenue for the second quarter was $214.3 million, an increase of 9% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Subscription revenue was $191.5 million, an increase of 17% as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Annualized Recurring Revenue grew 12% year-over-year."
"Patience! Great company, sound fundamentals. Market cap of 3.5 billion, sales of $800 million + compare this to twilio that has a market cap of $28 billion and only does 50% more sales. Cloud is the new ERA...this will easily go to $15, today it’s just moving with the NYSE"
Someone please be kind to help me out. I bought 55 CLDR calls for Jan23What happens to these?
Is $16/share the final price before it is sold? Icahn has been known to come up with something unexpected even though he has indicated he is in favor of the deal. Any potential offer has to get his blessings. God Bless and stay well all longs.
"Morgan Stanley Lifts Cloudera's Price Target to $15 From $14, Maintains Overweight RatingSanjit Singh from MS was the first one to ask a question last night in the Q&A session off the earnings call. He also raised his PT another $1 from yesterday, based on the information he received last night. This guy knows Cloudera very well. Hold them shares and add more if you have the cash. Another upgrade in the $14 to $15 range! The floor is now set and the future is bright. Cloudera is keeping their large customers and adding several more. The number of customers who generate ARR greater than $1 MILLION grew from 154 to 164. This is a great news."
"IBM just reported excellent numbers. CLDR has a partnership with them and perhaps it bodes well for us too. Also, maybe the RHT integration is completed and they could be on the prowl for more synergistic cloud companies such as CLDR and NTNX. Thoughts"
"Looks like there is very little CLDR stock for sale. Volume is way down and earnings is early next month. This train could be like the NTNX one. Both these cloud plays did not participate in the crazy move up. Instead they went way down. This could have a bigger move than NTNX with more clarity, a beat in earnings, Icahn in play here, a new CEO or a BO. Get in before this train leaves the station. Best wishes to all longs."
A year from now $12/share will be in the rear view mirror. Now it's a temporary resistance.
"Is $CLDR the next $SNOW? According to CLDR on the latest conference call, $CLDR is launching new products similar to that of Snowflakes. CLDR's many clients generating $800 million annual revenue will gradually transition to Snowflake's native cloud business model over the next 12 months. This transition will make CLDR one of the biggest native cloud big data warehousing and data analytics companies in this space. If $SNOW is worth between $40 billion and $80 billion, then, CLDR is will be worth at least 1/5 of that or $8 billion to $16 billion. CLDR's stock price at $11.25 per share values CLDR at a mere $3 billion in market cap. Thus CLDR is worth at least $25 to $50 per share."
The buyer of CLDR is holding our money hostage! Pay up now or provide ETA! We now have our money tied up earning no interest. How is this BS legal???
"If you notice extremely high volume loads when when this is bottoming. Usually means its an attempt to force it down past a support point but seems like there is a strong hold around 13.98 or so. That is a good sign since Cloudera presents at Needham in an hour. The news may not spark a significant jump, but obviously it worrys the shorts"
"I don’t understand the negative reaction. Q4 revenue up 42% year-over-yearQ4 subscription revenue up 50% year-over-yearNet expansion rate of 136%PALO ALTO, Calif., April 3, 2018 -- Cloudera, Inc. (NYSE: CLDR), the modern platform for machine learning and analytics optimized for the cloud, reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018, ended January 31, 2018. Total revenue was $103.5 million, an increase of 42% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Subscription revenue was $84.3 million, an increase of 50% from the year-ago period."
hmm.. 1 mill shares just traded in a 15 min window. looks like we got a buyer today
Carl Icahn owns 52 million shares of CLDR.Vanguard owns 19 million shares of CLDR.Blackrock owns 16 million shares of CLDR.Smart MONEY understands this is HUGE.
"The last two product releases (April and August) means that the real earnings will not be had until 4th qtr. Ultimately tomorrow's earnings for 2nd qtr are very much past tense and do not reflect on the current situation. CLDR has the wind at it's back and is smack dab in the center of the cloud business growth trend and is working with the right businesses, ie. Red hat/IBM. CLDR may run up then sell off....whatever. All I know is CLDR is worth over $22-25 easily so as for myself I will be patient."
"Listen to the ER conference call. A few key points. These guys are confident about the future. You can hear it. Also, the lower guidance is part of a conscious effort to stop following a legacy model and follow instead a CDP model, marketing the hybrid public/private cloud. Guess what. CDP is a much better product than the one CLDR has offered to this point. Who knew? Well, they found out, because their customers have let them know. And those customers are quickly migrating to CDP instead of the on-premises subscription services provided by Cloudera to this point. The company is transitioning from prepaid services (subscriptions) to consumption, pay-as-you-use it, hybrid cloud from CDP. This transition is just beginning. Last quarter customer migration to CDP increased from 10 to 15 percent. And many more will follow. They think more than half of customers will be migrating by the end of the year. And the potential of revenue stemming from usage versus prepaid subscriptions is huge. The near-term lowered guidance is a snapshot of transition required and the ancillary lower anticipated revenue from prepaid subscription as the company moves to much higher potential of usage fees generated by customers using CDP over time. But it takes just that, a little time. And thus the near-term adequate, yet disappointing guidance we heard in the ER report just issued. There will be a lag, but usage dollars versus subscription dollars are going to power this country to a much higher level. Short-term lower guidance is the cost. I'm holding from here and will buy more if it drifts lower. I think it's probably one-two years away. But, you need to know that the company has only had the results -- or maybe the realization -- of CDP potential for a little less than two quarters. The eye-opener they've had is compelling and they are confident that purposely moving the company in a more lucrative hybrid cloud direction is the way to go. Listen to the call. You'll feel better about things. CDP isn't the goal. It's the answer."
"At current price level CLDR stock is an exellent long opportunity according to risk/reward ratio. Most of technical companies on the market are overhyped so there are not much options for investing into technical sector. Fundamentally, Cloudera is only starting to accelerate its business with CDP according to last two quarters reports. Need to mention that at Sep 15, Cloudera's top management executed their options into the stock at 11.08$ (SEC data from cloudera's official web site).Taking into account technical Elliot wave analysis: price range 10.5-10.70$ is the strong support level and in case if CLDR will hold it, then there are very high probability that wave #3(or C) will shoot up into 20's very quickly. Yes, there are another technical support levels around 9$ but it could happen only if overall market will crash to March levels and even in this case I dont think it would happen at least until election.In any case, probability that CLDR share price will rise 5-10$ significalntly much higher than it will drop 2-3$ in coming months."

So the only question now is do you hold and collect the $16 or sell now at a discount? I doubt shareholders will vote no and it will probably take a few months to finalize the acquisition.

Cloudera products are strongly integrated into IBM offerings so the news about new IBM cloud company may preceed Cloudera aquisition announcement. Moreover few days ago Cloudera announced NVIDIA collaboration. You can find article about CDP-NVIDIA integration on Cloudera web-site blog.

"This is right up Cloudera’s ally. The question is does IBM need Cloudera right now to compliment their existing cloud business?The multiyear transformation of IBM has focused on developing and expanding what IBM calls an open hybrid cloud platform.""IBM is laser-focused on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity,"" Chief Executive Arvind Krishna said in written remarks with the announcement. Krishna took the reins as CEO in April, succeeding Ginni Rometty.A hybrid cloud architecture means IBM can provide its customers with both a public cloud and a private cloud, which gives a company extra network security. They share data and applications between them.It's among the reasons IBM acquired Red Hat in 2018 in a $34 billion deal. Red Hat provides an open source, cloud software business.In the past eight years, IBM has invested more than $120 billion in remaking the company. This includes $29 billion in capital expenditures, for things like scaling its cloud operations and artificial intelligence offerings and bolstering security and services capabilities.""Now is the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best,"" Krishna said. ""IBM will focus on its open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities. The new company will have greater agility to design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world's most important organizations."""
"Let's make one thing very clear....During the IPO's of both PLTR and SNOW both companies admitted that they would be posting losses for at least 2-3 years going forward, thus qtr loss should be no surprise. CLDR is turning the corner from losses to profits by posting GAAP profits the last 2 quarters. CLDR should have been the $33 stock and PLTR at $18 if that."
Wedbush's Daniel Ives said in early June a hypothetical strategic buyer could be interested in buying Cloudera's properties as its combined assets (with Hortonworks) could be worth $9 to $11 per share. That's encouraging news. :)

"Can anyone here confirm this comment? It's difficult to trust anyone anymore.

Gartner PeerInsights has Cloudera outscoring Microsoft in multiple categories. note: CLDR is piggybacked on Azure also (shown on Stocktwits).
Why this company is not bought by IBM or Oracle i am amazed !
The new CEO has a history of selling his companies and jumping from company to company. Could itbe ICahn picked him to assist with packaging CLDR with a nice bow and sell it out? May be thehope that CLDR will grow to $100 is dashed for some investors ... the real growth potential is limited.The packaged growth as in the conference is unlimited to attract buyers.
Oh man! Havent seen such a humble stock for long time! This mathafaka is not moving at all! Dunno how I happen to get stuck @18!
"Bearden said he has spent the past two or three months meeting with Cloudera’s management team to try to establish the plan for the company’s 2021 fiscal year, which begins on February 1, 2020. “I just got very excited about the team itself, the momentum the company was building, and the reception of the new product across the customer bases, and just saw a huge, massive opportunity, and things just fell into place naturally,” Bearden said."
"The chart does not look good (and the chart indicates trend, which should never be fought). She needs to hold the 10.40 line or 50 day MA). I was encouraged yesterday when I saw buyers stepping up around that level, but we need more volume today"
"I have re-read the June 1st press release and it clearly states that July 1st is the 30 day deadline. So if the 30 days begin the day after the original announcement then tomorrow, July 1st, would be considered the final day."
Sure the deal is done......but today is the final day of the 10 additional days and this is CLDR. $16 is set though if nothing else.
Cloudera fell partly after a disclosure that the company's sale to private equity firms will require China approval.
CLDR is holding up investor money. they should set a date and pay the investors the $16 price so the investors can move on with it. investors do not want to hive any cents to the business... haha
"Cloudera Inc : Barclays raises price target to $19 from $14. So it’s really worth $25. When they release Earnings soon, we go to $30."
"While I was hoping for some news or even whispers of a buyout, I think this rise is simply due to future prospects and gravity of $20 calling out. Definitely adds to an interesting week."
"If we see a 4th quarter earnings report like the 3rd QRT, this stock will rock to $20 easily."
"I am still trying to understand why CLDR does not attract more attention. It is expected to be profitable this year, closing in on $1Bil in revenue, and 4 straight quarters of solid reporting. I know last years spring report was beyond a disaster and left a bad taste in analysts mouth but that seems long gone so what is holding CLDR back. Soo many companies in the cloud space have less revenue and negative earnings for years to come and a market cap multiple times greater. Take Mongo. I know its a different product space but their next years earnings are -.82, rev of 660mil, and a market cap of 11.5 bil. CLDR has +.37, rev 938mil, and a market cap of 2.5Bil. I just dont dollow the logic. You could say Mongo is in the DB sector which is massive and CLDR is in a smaller sector, but really????"
"Looks like somebody timed it perfect for a good attempt at getting those $11.50 and $12 put options! Strange how that works out.If MM’s have anything to say about it, by close tomorrow, they will push the share price above $12 to not have to pay out on them. Hopefully after the options expirations and the orchestrated downward pressure is relieved, we will see the price recover.More than likely it was a new institution late to the party wanting some shares without fighting the tape to get them. There are roughly 28,000 put contracts at the $11.50 and $12 price. That equates to 2,800,000 actual shares. If an institution tried to buy those on the open market, it would drive the price up very quickly. Using the MM’s to acquire them via options prevents that move up..."
I am happy and excited to be holding CLDR at this time. The stock price has stabilized and Icahn is a major holder who believes CLDR is undervalued. He will agitate for change and/or sale. The next earnings report will see the progress management and team have made pertaining to the merger. A good report and forecast will move the stock much higher. An announcement of a reputable operator as CEO will also be good. News of smaller cloud plays picked up by tech titans will also be hugely positive. Best wishes to all longs.
Help. I have calls that don’t expire for 6mo. What happens?
"Cloudera is still king in data warehouse, especially now with new product CDP. Cloudera price should be $18 based on with Fy21 revenue and profit forecast. The buyout deal will be quite interesting,"
"Since late last year and into this year so far, CLDR has traded in a range. There is a CEO in place and he should have hit the ground running because he used to be CEO of Hortonworks which CLDR merged with. So, with Icahn having board control basically, why is it where it is? Looks like Icahn is being patient and seeing how CDP and the team is doing. If ER is good with good forecast, the stock will rise. If Icahn is not that impressed, he may insist on selling the company. Either way it goes, I have been accumulating. Best wishes to all patient longs. Thoughts."

"This is going to keep climbing (with a few down days) for the next 2 months and will get to 25 easliy. This is one of cheapest value cloud stocks. Look at AI, SNOW, UPST, etc and their market cap. CLDR can add AI feature to their platform and you will probably see it in less than a year. Keep buying. Today is the day when you can see the big bounce and Robinhooders will pour in soon!!!"
Big boy volume yesterday! Someone was able to add 1-2m on sale. Could be the same large call buyer accumulating!
snow and cldr have a very different appeal. snow is a dw only. now it is adding data integration features and partners but its an isolated software with its own security and governance. cldr is an end to end edge to ai integrated platform. cldr appeals to larger enterprises and those really concerned with data governance. Its dw is not as good as snow and its kafka platform isn't as good as confluent. but in totality from an enterprise architecture perspective it has tremendous appeal. my concern is that they need to expand their customer base beyond fortune 1000. they've made it easier to use and manage with cdp and if that holds true then they expand customer base and demand explodes.
MDB Hitting almost all time high is a clear indication how the the OPEN SOURCE Big data technologies are progressing. The blip in accounting is is a short term issue. 1. They did not lose any customers because of the merger2. This is difficult to to the existing customers to move from what they already have (long term commitment)3. Open Source software companies can do better already established with IBM acquiring Redhat. No company under the Sun did a seamless transformation in the first quarter after the merger. I feel good about the future. I am not trying to pump. Selling or buying is purely my personal decision. BTW people who say that h this company will be zero by 2021 or 2022 need to know that this company still produces revenue close to a billion dollars. 3 Times the revenue at 3 Bil MC seems right. This is not in line with the other Software companies but I will take it. BTW Intel is still strong behind this company. They know something that the Wall Street analysts who change their recommendations by flip of a coin. If only I their target price estimates are right I would have retired a decade ago. Good Luck.
"HUGE buy 136,000 share BUY of CLDR @ 1:10 pm today. let’s go CLDR, $20. is getting closer day by day."
"Smart money , as future buyers, are shorting it, so they can buy it cheaper before earnings. Should earnings be positive indicating growth & great forward guidance, As well cost cutting based on the merger .CLDR may jump up to $18-20 level."
If interest rate rises impact high growth names most and value names tend to win out then CLDR should keep performing nicely because they offer the most value among Hybrid cloud/Cloud companies. 9 trading days left until earnings.
"Don’t forget this is all about COVID19 and NOT Cloudera fundamentals. Cloudera just reported great earnings and a reduced float willonly help. JMP Securities, which has a market outperform rating on the stock and a $17 price target, said the results showed “a dramatically improved financial profile.”Cloudera's stock “could double from here” as the valuation remains attractive, said JMP Securities, while the company is seeing continued “improvements in sales execution and renewal rates.”"
"Cloud computing and data warehouse leader Cloudera had decent move today, peaked at $11.42 up 3% at peak trading moments while nearly all Tech stocks were down -3% to -5%. The $SNOW IPO pump n dump goes into this week and next week, likely and logically we should see some big Cloud Computing investors cashing out from $SNOW and look to re-invest the Profit into some of the super discounted stock like Cloudera $CLDR which is currently trading at less than 1/20th of $SNOW valuation but generating 4 times more sales revenue at much better profit margin than SNOW."
"Deal was supposed to close on 25th but they keep silence. Hopefully a better offer is in the works! How about 80B SNOW acquires 4B CLDR and transfer customers over to their services. This way SNOW sales will quadruple immediately and it'll double their share price easily... The resulting enterprise value, according to wall street math, will be 80B + 4B = 160B $$$ "
too bad.. there is no other offer for this company.
Added even more shares. Now my largest position. Truly believe this is post earnings consolidation. This will be $15 at some point this year.
CLDR rose through the 50 DMA on 8/1. The 200 DMA is $9.94. If and when it get through the 200 DMA and holds the chartists and technical buyers will be adding shares.
Don't forget Icahn has invested $300 MILLION of his money into CLDR. He owns close to 20% and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. He also negotiated to have two of his people on Cloudera's board and I'm sure Carl will influence who is the next CEO. Intel also has a very large stake and they have been holding at a loss for quite some time. I believe the combination of Icahn and Intel will eventually reward the patient investors. This might take longer than many are willing to wait.
"q2 months 234, it maintained good revenue and eps. q3, there are more and more demand on its services, without much of expenses, and q3 should be up in revenues, then there is a high possibility it will beat eps impressive, and moreover, there will be the trend for cloud services...will be the most impressive week for cloudera, can not wait, cheers."
All the actions show....Another higher offer next week???
"Last Earnings report, CLDR reported earnings as 2 seperate companies. This time it will report as one company. I conjecturre everything will be more transperabt this time. My intuition telles me that $9.60 price print was the lowest it will ever reach.11.205, 221 shares changed hands. more than twice average volume. New money came in, old investors bailed out, hence the collaps today. This marks new healthy uptrend."

"I found this a good read. very optimistic and shows how cloudera is being priced from what it was, not what is has with CDP and its strategy.I have faith this will eventually course correct. stay strong longs.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377150-cloudera-skating-where-puck-will-be"
"CLDR is doing just fine on its own. Over the next 2-3 quarters, we will see some very impressive results both top and bottom lines, driving CLDR up to the $50 range. My thinking is that once IBM breaks up the company they will then make an attempt to buy CLDR in around mid 2021, they will need to offer a premium offer about 20% over the stock price as IBM will have to deal with competitive offers once the word gets out. CLDR holders, by end of 2021, you all will be very happy investor."
"jun 1 , Jim Cramer lightning round. ""I think you have a winner there with Cloudera."". for what ever that means. it will at least attract even more attention and volume today. A little over 2 weeks ago we were at $8. In january we were st 12.22. Last week i was going to be thrilled if we settled above 10 pre earnings.. Now im wondering if we can challenge 12 pre earnings. If earnings go well what color model X should i get?"
"From Zack equity research:CLDR currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.37. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 85.48, so we one might conclude that CLDR is trading at a discount comparatively.We will see price up to 22$ soon"
today we will close above 11. let's go longs. we need some good news
"This is a relatively old news (8 days ago), but is rather important.Annual growth rate for big data is about 10-15%, for AI/ML is 45-50%.In my opinion, CLDR is in a unique position to provide holistic big data and AI/ML in hybrid cloud solutions, with its 2000+ global customer base.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloudera-sets-date-announce-first-124500585.html"
"I honestly think this stock price is being manipulated to stay low. with last earnings and potential for CDP this stock should be much higher, at least in high teens.maybe Intel is looking to buy and is keeping price down. just doesn't make sense."
"I've cashed 26k shares and am moving on to DKNG. While I would like to say it was a fun ride, that would not be the truth. Just glad to get out on the positive side. I will probably drop off following at the end of July after rest of my positions hit 1 yr and are sold off. Take care everyone."
for those speculating about deal no deal and new higher price etc... go to investor relations page on their website. deal is done. black and white in the pdf
"It is my belief that Blackrock buying 400,000 shares recently and owning over 15,000,000 shares has put a floor on the price near term. Blackrock reps have the ability to talk to management, which every day Joes like us do not, therefore they must have been pleased with their conversations with management. While I may think that $14 sp from last earning is way to cheap given the value of data analytic cloud companies, we just have to let it play out on the market. CLDR is without a doubt a takeover candidate though."
It Depends …. My basis is $6.17 I’m fine with it
"totally agree, both Microsoft and IBM bought open source company, even Amazon/Google/Google might interested in cldrCloudera (NYSE:CLDR) tapping former Hortonworks head Rob Bearden as CEO could make a sale more likely, says DA Davidson.Analyst Rishi Jaluria: ""Bearden’s background is one of M&A exits.""Bearden was CEO of Hortonworks when it merged with Cloudera, served as COO at SpringSource when it was acquired by VMware, and was the COO at JBoss, which was scooped up by Red Hat.The analyst sees IBM, Microsoft, and PE firms as the most likely buyers for Cloudera.DA Davidson maintains a Buy rating and $14 price target. Cloudera has a Neutral average Sell Side rating."
Don’t forget this was a $13 dollar stock last Monday. Sometimes a pause is needed before the next leg up. We could also use a couple of sideways days to build a new floor.
"Imagine where Cloudera will be once COVID is no longer a threat. Rob Bearden was very upbeat which is unusual for him. He is normally very reserved and cautious. Hmm!For the January quarter, Cloudera sees revenue of $219 million to $222 million, with non-GAAP profits of 10 to 12 cents a share, ahead of the previous Street consensus at $215.7 million in revenue and per-share earnings of 10 cents.For the January 2021 fiscal year, Cloudera now sees revenue of $862 million to $865 million, ahead of its previous forecast of $839 million to $853 million, with non-GAAP profits of 40 to 42 cents a share, up from 32 to 35 cents.The company also announced a $500 million addition to its stock repurchase plan.""We believe that Cloudera has never been better-positioned to capture more of the rapidly growing data management and analytics market opportunity for hybrid multi-cloud solutions,"" Cloudera CEO Rob Bearden said in a statement."
Shares sell for 16.13 yesterday...over 900k shares traded premarket this morning. Do we have an offer coming?
"In a week of a couple down days in the market and chaos in the nations capitol, I'd say that CLDR has performed strong. Yes, there was a dip to $13.50ish but the sp has bounced back. In 7 days CDP users on Amazon and Microsoft will need to have a ""paid subscription"" to continue using, thus new revenue stream will be building now during the 1st qtr. CEO Bearden even said that those users are growing at a 30-40% clip so serious additional $$$. Looking forward to the day SP goes up $2-4 in a day for a few days in a row....2021 will be awesome!"
Looks like consolidation and money channeled more toward trade related stocks today. Long and holding strong. Best wishes to all longs.
now is the time for people to calm down. you don't sell at a low point. the market is down and impacting all stocks. I'm holding as it will come back as will everything else.
I bought last year at 13.27 share and within a few months was down 60%+  funny thing cloudera was alteady down 15% then and I decided to take a chance. Luckily it was only 3% of my portfolio.Looks like I have a chance to break even after only 15 months. My how fast things can change in this environment
"Once The Street sees CDP is working and that Hadoop is an ideology and not technology as Ralph Kramden would say to Alice, 'Zoom, boom to the moon!'"
"Hi, guys, anyone has any idea why CLDR bought back Intel’s all 26M stocks with a term loan? CLDR is not paying dividends, so what is the purpose doing so? Why Intel agreed to deposit its investment with a huge loss?—Intel invested about double of what it received from this transaction?"
"I just want to remind everyone that this stock was $4.76 earlier this year. I know we all think stocks increase 10 fold in 6 months but that's not reality. The longer we establish this base from $10-13, the better."
The silence here is deafening. Is $16 the final offer or are they negotiating a higher offer? Technically we won’t know for certain until the company makes a final statement and that might not occur for another week or longer. The Shop clause specifically states they have an additional 10 days AFTER July 1st to finalize another offer if they get one before July 1st. If we see a spike above $16 after tomorrow we’ll know a White Knight showed up just in time.
"Now with 25000 shares at $10.90 cost, I am looking forward to adding another 15000 shares on any weakness. BTIG analyst has it right with his latest update and checkup with partners/clients showing good progress. Merger with Hortonworks was a great feat, and I believe company will reap its benefits in calendar 2020.....at current prices Hortonworks is a freebie!"
"LONDON and BOSTON, Feb. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Privitar, the leading data privacy platform provider, today announced that it has achieved certification on the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP). Building on Privitar's existing partnership with Cloudera, The Privitar Data Privacy Platform now natively integrates with CDP, providing flexibility for organizations to safely use sensitive data for analytics."
CEO still not appointed .Is it a signal that acquisition is on the cards ?
"I don’t understand the muted reaction, this was a great quarter. This should trade much higher tomorrow."
It’s nice to see double digits finally after a long time. Hope it stands after ER. MS upgraded to $11 from $9 just 2 days before earning release. There will be lots of upgrade after earning and on Friday. They will beat earning without any doubt and guidance would be very positive.
Today's volume now 2 1/2x normal which is usually a very good sign. Is anyone selling into earnings? Sometimes even with a beat on earnings the stock falls with the announcement. I generally sell into earnings and have tracked it and it has been a good move even when companies beat the estimates.
"I use Hadoop daily, from Cloudera. This company has been seriously overlooked - I’m happy to see the sentiment shifting"
"Why does this stock get manipulated like a clockwork? Is it Icahn? It is in red hot sector (Competitor trades at 25 times valuation), has decent growth, bullish conference call, broader market on fire. Most companies in this sector are trading at bubble of the century valuations. I mean 4 billion is like a pocket change for these companies. This should be trading at at least 20-25 even considering normal valuation.I keep thinking this time is different, but no it is same sad story every single time. Stock loses huge chunk of its gains,"
Very much encouraging action today. If the lower lows gets higher in the next couple of days and it’s time to accumulate or even increase the positions substantially.
"Someone mentioned that Cloudera was not always a cloud company. They are correct. Oh, the irony-- CLOUDera. I would argue that they aren't necessarily a cloud company today. They have remade themselves into a data analytics company who happens to have a cloud offering.I worked in Cloudera support from 2015 to 2020. Many of the customers I supported ran CDH clusters in the cloud. So, the decision to leverage the cloud with the CDP offering wasn't that difficult of a transition. In fact, the transition was very fast-- due to a sense of urgency resulting from customers deciding to use AWS and Azure big data offerings-- not as good, but less complicated to deploy (Zero configuration... just push a button.) AWS, Azure and Google are still potential threats. However, CLDR smartly decided to partner with them. Things are good for now. However, the latent threat remains.Despite the speed in delivering CDP to market, a lot of thought went into developing the product. Further, the continuous feedback from customers allows them to shorten the patch, version and release cycles.The slick thing I like about CDP is that customers can move workloads between public clouds and still maintain the workload's security, access and governance, while avoiding ""vendor lock-in."" Further, customers can port workloads from on-prem, to the cloud, and back to on-prem. This gives the customer flexibility to house workloads on-prem, but leverage non-peak hours to leverage cloud resources to process workloads at a cheaper price.My take on whether to hold. I say hold. When the stock crashed in March 2020, as a former employee, it was a no-brainer to load the boat-- it wasn't a $5 company then, and it's not an $18 company today.I think the reason why the stock moves slowly to the upside is that most of CLDR shareholders (in share volume) are institutional investors, not retail investors investing on RH, and getting their investing advice from WSB.Just my 2-cents."
"You know, to acquire this much technical talent in one company at one time is really hard, and all the big companies like MSFT, GOOG, Oracle, INTC are always looking for amazing people. That asset is not fully represented on the balance sheet, and because tech is so hard, this is one of those unique mispricings that the market will give you from time to time. A great CEO would be a huge plus to keep this a stand alone company, but there is a lot of management talent out there--tech engineers, coders, and systems experts are much harder to find, train, and integrate. Terrific opportunity for someone out there to really hit one out of the park! Thanks and gl to all. (I just bought more shares, cut my basis in half, and think may be an amazing opportunity. Small part of the portfolio, but could really be amazing if it works out, and if not, oh well, it's a portfolio, and the only free lunch on Wall Street is diversification, because we all know--our crystal balls are crystal clear going backward, but forward, it's a little murkier!)"
I believe August 25th is the day to finalize the offer. Does anyone know if that is the case?
"This is not considered a cloud growth stock by the market anymore....they are buying SNOW and stocks of that ilk.....I think they are wrong, but the price doesnt back me up so far....very disappointing price action....mgt better get on the stick...hoping for uplift at next earnings report....or takeover, which I know Ichan is working on it...."
"I think this stock is incredibly under valued. Their mistake was not incentivizing their existing customers to continue renewals by offering incentives when they transition to the new platform. And they should have gotten some POCs on the new platform to help market its value, like GSK. They have built their entire Data Sciences COI on the Cloudera platform, stood up facilities on two continents to drive data through it. What a great POC success story to market! Leadership dropped the ball, and a new captain can drive this thing up in value. Stay strong !"
Cloudera has to wade through all the legal actions before it can complete an M&A. It’s employees have probably experienced lots of personnel scrambling at this point. If anyone there noticed HR people slowly peeling away — that’s you indicator.

if you own shares vote.....be careful....the wording is evil...and should result in a another law suit....thanks uncle carl....this is not over!
"There's something strangely wrong here, the stock price of CLDR is so undervalued based on other company values in the business. This stock should be selling in the $30 range. It want be too much longer that the sellers will be caught off guard and wished they have never sold."
The moral of CLDR employees within the company must be bad especially when they do not know what their future employment be like..
"Also, the redhat and ibm interview was interesting today. They seem to believe that the software/cloud hybrid is the future. that is good for Cloudera. Don't expect much movement untill a new ceo is announced."
When will we know that the $16 transaction happen? After the earning report date?
Earnings bump stock up ?
To bad we aren't still waiting on new deal news with the last few days of the 10 additional day period ending on Sunday....kinda miss the drama and possibility of a company offering more at the last minute. Have a great weekend.
"From my own research of Cloudera, Red Hat (from talk to acquisition) and tech majors like IBM, I see there is a real possibility for an imminent acquisition, possibly in two months. The following are the supports:1.) IBM, Intel and Microsoft had been known for engaging merge talk with Cloudera or express interest to acquire since April 2020 when Media first started speculating the possibilities.2.) If you look at when the Red Hat (Cloud Infrastructure, acquired by IBM in 2018), from Red Hat first become the subject of speculation to acquisition announcement date, it was around 8 months time frame, possibly because due diligence and rounds of confidential negotiation.3.) IBM announced the Red Hat acquisition on 10/26/2018, a little over a month after Red Hat released Better-than-expected Q2 (6 months ending 6/30/2018) earnings growth on 9/19/2018. Red Hat stock price, after Q2 earnings, counter-intuitively dropped -16% from $125 a share to $106 a share and bounced around the $103--$108 range for over a month after earnings, until IBM pulled the trigger to buy Red Hat and its price jumped to $158 overnight (+54% Premium). Most likely Red Hat's price had been suppressed (despite beat earnings) by the acquirer intentionally for the month before merge announcement in order to finalize on the deep discount.4.) IBM, Intel, even Microsoft are desperately trying to play a leading role in Cloud Computing and catch up with the Amazon Cloud which controls its own Cloud Eco system including: 1. Racks, 2. Data Centers/Virtualization 3. Hosting Solution 4. Big Data Analytics and Automation. IBM now has Racks (from Red Hat acquisition) and Data Center from its core business, IBM desperately needs Hosting and Big Data Analytics to complete its Eco System and to lead Cloud future, IBM has been long perceived as old computer maker and data center operator, it is now desperately try to move into Cloud and shift its image to a dynamic Cloud leader like Microsoft had done seven years ago. Cloudera acquisition will provide IBM Hosting & Big Data Analytics Automation, which IBM desperately needs to make transition and to compete,(5.) Cloudera is currently undervalued, comparing to its major competitors like SnowFlakes, Cloudera had 4 times more sales revenue and market than SnowFlake and Cloudera had just achieved NonGAAP positive earnings for the first time in Cloudera history in Q2 earnings, a true milestone, while SnowFlake Lost close to $200 Million in the same quarter. Cloudera trading at $11 a share or $3.3 Billion Valuation, SnowFlake trading at $70 a share or $12 Billion Valuation. Cloudera is at least two times undervalued at where its price stands today,(6.) Cloudera Q2 milestone had indicated Successfully tranistioning to Cloud and MultiCloud, and generated many hundred millions in cash flow, and forecasted aggressive future growth, that means it has begun to turn into a cash cow from 2020 and on..What can be a better time to acquire the Cloudera (cash cow in the making) that has the leading Cloud data analytic and automation niche at extra deeply discounted in price???? !!!"
"We finally have the date!Dear Cloudera Stockholder:You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the “Special Meeting”) of stockholders of Cloudera, Inc.

For purposes of attendance at the Special Meeting, all references in this proxy statement to “present in person” or “in person” shall mean virtually present at the Special Meeting.At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on (i) a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger."
CLDR has moat that DB and SNOW do not. Management focused on doing things the right way. A much better long term play. It's worth $75 no matter how you look at it - by cash flow or by industry EV multiple.
"Unnecessary Sell off, I am not selling my shares:Now what Cloudera management issued fiscal year 2022 guidance between $907 million and $927 million and earnings between $0.35 and $0.39. But analysts were estimating sales of $948 million and earnings of $0.48 per share. Despite management issuing guidance that's lower than Wall Street's expectations, investors may want to focus more of their attention on the company's strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2021 performance, rather than selling the stock based on analysts' future predictions."
Hmmmm... How high will they take this pre earnings? What are the chances of breaking $13 pre earnings?
Cloudera to announce 4Q results on March 10th at market close and CC at 5pm EST.
PE wins. There is no other deal otherwise CLDR would be committing an SEC violation for not telling investors by the deadline as having another bid to review would be considered material information. If any investors sold shares after the deadline and Cloudera announces a higher bid also after the deadline then Cloudera could be sued for lost profits.
"I have posted a study on data warehousing shown on Stocktwits twice only to have Yahoo delete the post. Go ahead and look for yourself the post is on 2/10 at 10:35am. Cloudera competes and outperforms the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Snowflake"
What a brutal week. Going from a positive breakout just over $12 and getting hype on CNBC to $10.69 in 2 days. No love for CLDR and management is not helping with their never ending silence. All the positive developments this year and management can't provide a positive statement at the very least meanwhile Snowflake bragging about Goldman relationship. Very frustrating.
"I have accumulated 21000 shares at $10.95 price, and want to keep adding to my position. Looking for intelligent exchange (both positive and negative). So pumpers and dooms-day folks stay away from this thread. Only those who can contribute new or substantial information are welcomed. Here is my thesis:CLDR is trading at 3X this year's revenues (using $825MM projection, using 279MM shares projection at year-end, subtracting about $500mm from excess current assets of cash, securities, prepaids, etc). I do not know of any large Cloud company that is trading at this valuation, while growing at 20%/year!CLDR is in position to generate cashflow of $100MM next year, and only reason for this year's shortfall is merger related accounting, systems integration, and overall combination related exercises. Once market believes this, the stock would have jumped to $15/share.CLDR comprehensive new product will be released in second half. This should create huge momentum, and institutional investors will start buying a month or so in advance of that, and the momentum should continue for another year.CLDR management and board composition is world class. We have a CEO who has sold previous companies to IBM, Redhat executive on board who understands synergies with IBM. Thus, likelihood of IB acquiring CLDR is reasonable next year around $20/share or higher. CLDR's high percentage of recurring revenue stream provides excellent backdrop for high margins to continue growing. Their services revenues as percentage of total revenues will continue to decline.Private Equity firms likes Vista and Thom Bravo are for sure looking at CLDR as a takeout prospect. They will approach the company around end of the year once integration is done, and growth visibility improves. This means company could touch $20/share next year.Downside to CLDR is of 5% or so from here...………..upside is of 100% within a year."
"Cloudera Surges as It Puts Estimates to Shameloudera Inc. (CLDR - Get Report) , a little-known small-cap cloud software company, blew earnings estimates out of the water, sending the stock up 9.06% to $12.64 a share on Thursday.The $1.79 billion market cap company reported a much narrower third-quarter loss than expected. Net loss per share was an adjusted 3 cents, compared to analysts' estimates of 11 cents, a surprise to the upside of 73%. The GAAP loss in the quarter was $26.5 million. Sales came in at $118.18 million, beating estimates of just above $113 million. ""We are pleased with our execution in Q3 and our progress on the strategic combination we have announced with Hortonworks,"" said CEO Tom Reilly. Cloudera announced in October it was buying Hortonworks Inc. (HDP) , another software company, for . ""Pre-closing merger integration planning is going well. And more importantly, we are very encouraged by the reception that our plans are receiving from customers, partners and the developer community,"" Reilly said. Cloudera issued guidance for the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31, saying it expects revenue of between $119 million and $122 million, representing a 17% year-over-year increase. The company expects a loss per share of 10 cents to 12 cents. Meanwhile, Hortonworks was rising 7.92% to $16.35 on its soon-to-be parent's earnings print. Cloudera stock, which has whipsawed around this year, has fallen 23.88% year to date.They will take notice eventually and longs will be richly rewarded. Be patient and add if you can."
Interesting price action today considering some here believe the Go Shop agreement has expired and $16 is the final price. If this were the case I would have expected selling pressure considering this to be dead money until the aPE acquisition is finalized. Anyone have an opinion?
When is the go shop period date over. This week I thought???Doesn't CLDR Legally need to disclose the results? Any attorneys out there?
Any ETA on cash out to?
"Pre-market and after hours last night after the CEO announcement, the stock price was up. After open it dropped and has stayed negative. I took it as a buying opportunity and added. I listened to the Needham's interview with the new CEO and I believe CLDR is in good hands. He knows what he is talking about and whether he is brought on to grow the business or to get it ready for sale, the stock should go higher. He mentioned AWS, MSFT and IBM in his interview and CLDR works with these titans so if CDP is what it is cracked up to be, the company will be a hot item. Best wishes to the new CEO and to all patient longs."
"Mario Mario Mario, I’m probably the only one who hasn’t muted your sorry @@. I told you how the Nasdaq index works these days right? It’s being driven from less than 10 stocks: TSLA, AAPL, FB, NVDA, GOOG, ANZN, Visa, MSFT, KLA. Which means the index has little to do with tech companies any more and isn’t being driven from smaller companies."
"This action reminds me to the latest BOX earnings, when all the technical traders and people who cannot read financial statements were shaken out after a good ER and next day it was bought up hard. Let’s see if this is the case here."
"CLDR is a MAJOR PLAYER a in the Cloud business, a MAJOR S/P is coming...Here’s is what they do:Cloudera, Inc. provides a suite of data analytics and management products in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The company operates through two segments, Subscription and Services. It offers Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub that allows companies to execute various analytic functions against a shared set of governed and secures data in public and private clouds, and data centers; Cloudera Data Warehouse, a hybrid cloud solution for self-service analytics; Cloudera Data Science and Engineering enables users to streamline, simplify, and scale big data processing; and Cloudera Operational DB that enables stream processing and real-time analytics on continuously changing data. The company also provides Hortonworks Data Platform, a data management platform that helps organizations to securely store, process, and analyze various data assets; Cloudera DataFlow, a data platform that collects, curates and analyzes data; Cloudera Data Science Workbench that enables self-service data science for the enterprise; and Cloudera Altus, a platform-as-a-service offering In addition, it offers Cloudera SDX, a solution that enables common security, governance, lineage, and metadata management for multiple analytics functions; and Cloudera Workload XM, an analytic workload experience management cloud service. Further, the company provides consulting, professional, and education services. It serves corporate enterprises and public sector organizations primarily through its direct sales force. The company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California."
"CLDR has risen 78% since Oct. 28th close. 78% in less than 4 months and at $17.11 still only has a $5.3 Billion market cap vs FSLY $113 sp, $13 Billion market cap. CLDR incredibly cheap."
Wouldn't pay too much attention in the short term whether down or up. It's the next qtrly release with forecast that matters long term.
"This is the same move that happened on August 20th. On the 21st and the few days that followed, they gave most of it back.If you look at all the companies on the bottom of all these posts that ‘People Also Watch’, they are all up mostly +5%, like I also noticed on August 20th. If those are all cloud service companies, this move you are seeing today most likely will be given back in the next few days. It is probably institutions buying into a broad swath of cloud service companies, not just specifically Cloudera. Although any additional institutional accumulation can only help our cause.Trade accordingly, as I believe we still have a few more weeks to go before any substantial and sustained move up on a confirmed buyout..."
"I’m still surprised that INM didn’t pick up CLDR, they just made sense I thought. Maybe with their top and bottom beat they will try an end around?"
"Cloudera delivered more than expected result this quater, much more than in fiscal guidance, and a long better future to come, there is no doubt. cheers, up huge after conference call soon cominf."
"Who is CLDR's biggest competitor? Amazon. Why? because CLDR was slow to provide a cloud-based big data platform. Amazon's EMR is easy to scale and deploy. Now Cloudera Data Platform will change competition landscape dramatically, scalability is not an issue anymore, deployment is fast and easy to use. Amazon's big data service is more for companies want to create and deploy something quickly with less cost. CDP have following advantage comparing with AWS to win global enterprise 2000:- Open source so enterprise can view and custom code to support more data format and troubleshoot issues.- CDP supports multiple cloud and AWS does not - CDP's security, governance, and compliance features are more powerful than AWS"
How can you compare companies in the same Cloud Business? Something drastically wrong here!!!SNOW Revenue $489.28M with a Market Cap Valuation of $109.76 Billion with a stock price of $387.70 PSCLDR Revenue $854.40M with a Market Cap Valuation of $.....3.88 Billion with a stock price of $12.41 PSCan someone please tell me why the most serious difference can be ignored by investors?
Intel owns 26.07 million shares. Ichan owns 52.33m shrs. BlackRock Owns 16.27 m shrs. Ride VLDR with these big boys. One day CLDR will be sold at a nice premium. Stay LT
The earnings would have gotten us back to 19. But someone felt that selling (aka ratting) us out at 16 is great idea. Scam
Why would anyone (without some NEW AND clearly INSIDE information) buy this for MORE than $16?? THE only public information is that it’s getting cashed out by PE firms at $16 in 3+ months??? People are dumb but not THAT dumb right? AND Its quite a bit of volume too?What is going on? Am I taking crazy pills?
Cloudera filed the proxy statement with the SEC so it looks like game over. https://newsfilter.io/a/8c904bf8cdaecb52b7275a2e415752c9
"I am excited about CLDR as a potential BO candidate. Why? Icahn is here to make money, typically short term. Legacy and mid size enterprise software companies are looking for revenue and growth. CLDR is undervalued. See the BOs from CRM and VMW just today. There is no CEO for acquiring company's management to share power with. Thoughts."
This is an Intel take down. Out of 5G smartphone chip market really has minimal to no effect on CLDR. But given the poor mgmt representation at the last conference call as much negative as possible is being reflected in the stock price. Very inexpensive acquisition looms for a larger company looking to expand in the environment CLDR already is. A good management team will see this.
"Carl Icahn’s Notable Q3 Buys/Increases:In the quarter, Icahn Capital’s other top buys were Cloudera (CLDR), Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ), and Caesars Entertainment (CZR).

CLDR seems to have held much more stronger than most other Cloud stocks in my portfolio.
Voted no this morning !!
"YOUR Appraisal Rights! Fair value about $ 35 !How you can get more for your Cloudera shares than the 16 $ bid!Read this.If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who continuously hold shares of Cloudera common stock through the Effective Time, who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and do not withdraw their demands or otherwise lose their rights to seek appraisal will be entitled to seek appraisal of their shares in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of Cloudera common stock who perfect their appraisal rights, who do not thereafter withdraw their demand for appraisal, and who follow the procedures in the manner prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL may be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of Cloudera common stock, exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any,"
I thought deal closes yesterday? What happened?
"I just checked and 80% of the company shares are owned by institutions, 4% by mutual family and 13.4% by insiders. Less than 5% appears to be owned by retail investors like us. Hold them shares because they will be very valuable when the fireworks start."
"CDP is gaining momentum.""We continue to execute well, delivering another strong quarter in Q4 on financial and operational metrics,"" CEO Rob Bearden said in a statement. ""I am especially pleased that we're seeing strong interest in CDP, with many customers across our base building plans for CDP Public Cloud adoption.""Cloudera launched its highly-anticipated Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) in September, nine months after finalizing its merger with Hortonworks. The enterprise data cloud company expanded the availability of CDP in the fourth quarter, bringing it to the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. In Q2 2021, Bearden said, the company expects to release CDP Private Cloud. ""I could not be more enthusiastic about the set-up for Cloudera as we enter the next phase of the market's evolution, helping our customers realize true hybrid and multi-cloud data solutions,"" he said. In the fourth quarter, subscription revenue came to $182 million. Annualized Recurring Revenue at the conclusion of the quarter was $731.2 million, representing 11 percent year-over-year growth. Customers with Annualized Recurring Revenue greater than $100,000 were 1004, up 27 from the prior quarter."
"I had every intention of getting out last week, had my plan b set and everything. Then got some negative info on plan b and decided to stay a bit longer. Today the market is up, led by tech, and this one is down. What a disappointment."
"Equally as important as the new CEO is the fact that the Icahn Capital board member is now the Chairman of the Board. This company is just a fraction of the value of the Horton Works deal. These two will be very motivated to drive shareholder value much, much higher...."
Bought 1000 shares today.Stock deserves more attention.Will snap up more shares on any dips. Its time to load the wagon on a great business.
"this past weekend I emailed a Goldman Sachs analyst about an article listing the top 12 Cloud companies for 2021. I pointed out that Cloudera was not listed then went through their $900 million revenue, GAAP positive and only a $4 Billion market valuation vs Snowflake having $600 million revenue, losses every quarter and for at least the next year or two and having an $80 Billion market cap. I let him know that CLDR could move from $14 to $57 and still only have a $16 Billion market cap.Lastly, I asked him Why doesn't Cloudera get any love from Wall St analysts? Not looking for a reply email. Just hope he considers taking a real hard look at Cloudera. Would be nice to a positive GS note especially if they agree on an SP above $40.....then maybe we can get a number $1-$4 up days in a row..."
Today is the first day since March 5th that we are above the 200DMA. Need to create a base above this and start driving the 50DMA closer and eventually cross over for a golden cross. I believe with the positive results and updated positive guidance for 2020 in the last earnings call will drive us higher. Had it not been for Covid hitting right at the last earnings call we would have been at $12 to $13 based on those results. I think the price trading in a narrow range is retail and funds waiting to see if they hold the guidance they raised last quarter. I think if they hold or increase guidance this should do well. If they lower guidance or don't guide we will drop. Just my humble opinion.
"Ibm is now focusing cloud business, it may buyout CLDR"
"Selling this business WAY below its fair value of about $35, is highly suspicious! Bonus and ""bonus"" ? If no higher offer is made, criminal investigation is necessary! Since the IPO, the company has made huge strides! If you factor in inflation, $16 is just the 2017 IPO price. What a disgrace!"
Just crossed the 200 day moving average with the 50 day moving average approaching golden cross pattern.
"Do not get me wrong. CLDR has made tremendous strides and the SP is incredibly undervalued. The CLDR story is compelling along with the technology, which is why I am as frustrated as anyone the Bearden is downtrodden when talking to analysts. The big money moves the stock not the little players like us here on the chat board. I believe that a good $3-4 in SP is missing strictly due to Bearden's tone and lack of enthusiasm. CLDR should be up past $14 not just on earnings but also due to Snow's IPO which placed a focus on the sector. If Bearden was more engaging with analyst during the 4 financial presentations over the past two weeks then Mario wouldn't be on this board spouting off. I am also disappointed that management never even address whether or not they have had discussions with interested parties. Management is never perfect but being open with shareholders and showing belief in the company you are leading aren't to much to ask."
Lots of tech stocks did well today. What happened to CLDR? Looks like Icahn sold some according to sec filings. His entities still holds the most shares at CLDR. Why did he sell some? We can speculate the reasons but I am still long either as a standalone or CLDR getting acquired because I believe in its value and the new management's ability to execute. God Bless and stay well.
Thumbs up if new offer comes / thumbs down if this is a done deal. Thanks!
"CLDR: THIS STOCK IS PRIMED TO DOUBLE UP...Digging into valuation, CLDR currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.37. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 85.48, so we one might conclude that CLDR is trading at a discount comparatively."
"Just listened to conference call and I am dizzy from all the jargon but my general feel is it was very positive but they kept hedging for Covid affects, signed up more customers for over $1 mill in spend this QTR than all of last year. Upgrades coming-the analysts have no idea how to value the company they were basically asking them how to value this versus a public cloud like Snowflake. Very interesting this is cheap is my original reaction. Long 2500 options and 20k shares so I pay attention to this stuff. I bet upgrades coming 17-20 dollar range. Buy out price would be 25-35 in my opinion but I don't think they want to sell."
I guess some investors still believe $16 isn’t the final offer. Nice volume this morning but I won’t get excited until I see the sp spike above $16.
"My price target for Cloudera assuming no major economic or new public health catastrophe1. $17 after next earnings in December if no acquisition news reported on or before October 23; $34, if acquisition announced in October or November2.) $32 a share in mid or late Calendar Year 2021; $48 to $55, if acquisition announcement next yearIn my personal opinion after reading everything I need to know on Cloudera and its competitors."
"Analysts price targets $20+, positive ratings and nice momentum last 30 days. If we cross $14.37 this week it should get interesting heading into earnings."
"I think this thing is about to moon if earnings reports on similar cloud companies are your guide. Also unusual options activity has been fairly heavy on this. I actually bought a few shares and options as a play into earnings thinking there could be a boost. As I've done more and more DD, I'm really liking the numbers here. The financial charts look excellent. EPS is up 40.6% and 68.3% the last year years. Projected to be up almost 300% next year. Revenues have gone up 29% and 65.5% the last 2 years. Cash flow has also gone up quite nicely as well! And no long term debt! I added more today. I really like this stock."
