The earnings would have gotten us back to 19. But someone felt that selling (aka ratting) us out at 16 is great idea. Scam
"FYI, Etrade stated that the money for my shares will be deposited in my account this weekend."
"Deal was supposed to close on 25th but they keep silence. Hopefully a better offer is in the works! How about 80B SNOW acquires 4B CLDR and transfer customers over to their services. This way SNOW sales will quadruple immediately and it'll double their share price easily... The resulting enterprise value, according to wall street math, will be 80B + 4B = 160B $$$ "
Thinking of the likely chance to see my avg @ 18 :)))
"Hi all, I just wanted to let people know I called my bank about the payout settlement and was told the deal is still in the preliminary phases. They suggested I call investor relations. Just letting you know in case you want to do the same. The bank seemed to think it could take a minimum of one month but could take several. Iâ€™ll see what the company says. Good luck everyone!"
Big move today! 0.00000000001 cents up!
"I didn't see any news, but it is gravitating towards that $16 closure number. Volume is much higher too.Somebody is trying to grab those last few cents. Is the closure imminent?"
In IB trading is closed why?
vanguard cancelled my trade because of a corporate action on Oct 8
When will we know that the $16 transaction happen? After the earning report date?
"I looked at recent filing. Based on departure of certain key executives, in between lines, it looks like they anticipate the deal will close before Thanksgiving."
Any ETA on cash out to?
CLDR is holding up investor money. they should set a date and pay the investors the $16 price so the investors can move on with it. investors do not want to hive any cents to the business... haha

What is wrong with this chart?
Thumbs up if new offer comes / thumbs down if this is a done deal. Thanks!
"Why this stocks graph look like horizontal line, since july?It is even daily look like that."
The buyer of CLDR is holding our money hostage! Pay up now or provide ETA! We now have our money tied up earning no interest. How is this BS legal???
"It was an odd ride with many weird feeling. Finally, this one has gone from my account with $16/stock. Thank you all for info. and sharing the ride."
