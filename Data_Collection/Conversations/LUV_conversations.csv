"Gary Kelly, Southwest Air CEO on CNBC now. Generally positive going forward. Right now only airline in the red. Won’t fire employees that don’t get vaccinated. Not being pessimistic but being realistic. Things will improve in business travel. Low cost, well positioned."

Told you. Just sold my DWAC stock. Will invest some in LUV Tuesday next week
"""Every single year for the past 5 years the airlines ETF Jets and other airline companies have ran up in November. This time there's also a massive catalyst on November 8th as the International travel ban is lifted in the US. Warning sent."" https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1453883632838402139?s=20$JETS $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $BA $ALK"
Southwest did more damage to themselves today than nearly any airline in recent history. No communication and canceled nearly every flight claiming “weather”. I regret to be a LUV owner over this weekend
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than LUV
"Southwest management needs to get ahead of this and stop blaming FAA and weather. Take ownership and tell the public how they are going to fix it and repair public trust,"
I wouldn't touch or hold LUV with a ten foot pole right now. This is just the beginning.
"The class action lawsuit filed by the pilots association against Southwest Airlines should have every one of you cheering and paying close attention. These pilots aren’t just collectively standing up fo their own rights - at this point they are representing all of us fighting for medical freedom. It is only one tiny step from mandates tor employees to mandates for passengers to mandates for all civil and commercial activities. Thank you to these brave pilots and the attorneys representing them in court. Link to the lawsuit is here - as well as the contact information for the attorneys representing. Send them a heartfelt thank you and if you’re so inclined, a financial contribution to the upcoming legal fees. A victory for these pilots would be a victory for us all."
"The risk to reward for airlines at these levels is amazing, incoming catalysts below:- Massive influx of demand on November 8th as international travel ban is lifted by the US- Holiday season demand will be higher than usual as many weren't able to travel last holiday season- Oil prices have peaked short-term and is beginning to downtrend a bit- As demand increases pricing power of ticket prices will combat elevated oil costs.$DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $JETS $BA"
"LUV isn't going out of business, but they will be losing money for another year. What's a good price to buy?"
"Key Points • Southwest Airlines reported a disappointing (but expected) loss for the third quarter earlier this week. • The airline giant is bracing for an even bigger loss in the fourth quarter. • Other airlines have proven more nimble than Southwest over the past year, making it hard to justify Southwest Airlines' valuation premium.For much of its 50-year history, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has been one of the most profitable airlines in the world. Indeed, from 1973 to 2019, the company put together a string of 47 consecutive annual profits: an amazing feat in such a volatile business. Most of its main competitors went bankrupt over that period (some more than once).However, Southwest Airlines has posted subpar results since the COVID-19 pandemic upended the airline industry last year. The carrier continued that trend this week, reporting a loss for the third quarter and projecting an even bigger loss for the current quarter."
"• Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfenningwerth downgraded Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) to In-Line from Outperform and lowered the price target to $48 (an upside of 0.51%) from $55. • Given his view of longer-lasting rebuild cost pressures and his opinion that Street expectations are ""overly optimistic,"" he sees muted valuation upside. • As a response to insufficient staffing and recent operational challenges, Southwest is ""logically"" slowing its growth rate in Q4 and Q1, but ramping hiring while slowing growth and increasing capital intensity makes it tougher to argue for the stock as a standout versus better executing alternative airlines, Pfenningwerth notes."
"time to short LUV ................. customer will avoid unvaccinated air carriers, fuel costs are rising, business travel remains low. Southwest's lack of courage around vaccine mandates will be very detrimental IMO"
LUV looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
Corporations that choose political sides automatically lose half of their customers.
