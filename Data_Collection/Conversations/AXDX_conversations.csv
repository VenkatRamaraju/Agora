"Volume just doubled the average. Even if it triples we still have 2 or 3 interesting weeks ahead, this is just getting started. AXDX was not deserving to be in the single digits, they have a unique product that can still surprise. Insiders would not be buying heavy otherwise"
Guys... its happening again. Saw this on the other board. Makes sense to me. 15.8 million shares short interest + 25 million share float + non-stop inside buying + accelerating product placements + 100% borrow rates + Buy-Ins + 15-20 short hedge funds running for a tiny little door + high likelihood of takeover = Doubling of Stock price in 2 Weeks! Greatest short Sqeeze starting to unfold! You heard it here first. Been trading this stock for 5 years! Made money on Every Squeeze just by watching the borrow rates...
"watch out for the next short squeeze, this has been trading down for 3 months then up for 3 months for th elast few years as another trader mentioned below. We have +50% interest and +100 day cover, the next short squeeze could be epic. Already has bottomed near march lows plus the company will keep making progress. Also look at the huge amount of buys by Jack W Schuler at higher prices than today. This year he bought 10 million in the open market, no free stock options from the company."
"Revenue growth is still a drag on the stock. Hopefully, they can give guidance to show acceleration of revenue..... No pun intended."
"Posted this comment on SA. The current paradigm of empiric therapy/ and pre/post culture tests can be hard to grasp. Appreciate feedback from all: And If you want quantitive evidence just look at their bacteria panel pivotal trial: https://www.t2biosystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/T2Bacteria-Pivotal-Trial-White-Paper.pdf 44% of BSI confirmed patients were on inadequate therapy - as in, their antibiotics were not treating the bug. Investors are really missing the boat on the clinical impact of the technology which is what is ultimately going to drive adoption. For some added context the impact is at the VERY LEAST as much as $AXDX and look at how the market values that company. I think AXDX has awesome technology but the discrepancy makes no sense to me. But here’s my take - AXDX’s main value proposition and what the company touts more than anything else is their rapid AST. If you look at their recent presentation on slide 5 it reads “...Study found that 84% of patient’s could have therapy optimized...” and they cite this study below it:https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2018/webprogram/Paper72523.htmlI don’t know where they get the 84% figure but let’s just take their word for it. Just to be clear this is 84% of patients with a positive blood culture or that have a BSI.Unfortunately, we don’t have a meta analysis yet of the bacterial panel looking at “optimization” of therapy. We just know 44% are on inadequate therapy. Instead T2 conducted a separate study to look at deescalation/optimization”: https://www.t2biosystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/T2Bacteria-Pivotal-Trial-White-Paper.pdfI believe the study included 23 patients and they found 36 opportunities to de-escalate therapy or in other words a form of “optimization”. Now we also have candida infections that represent 10% of all blood stream infections where hospitals have been finding missed infections and recently on a webinar a physician said T2 cut their hospital’s anti-fungal rate usage by 50%. Now this is just my speculation but taking all of this together on top of the 44% we know could be optimized I could see the optimization percentage easily in the 50-60% range at least and all occurring in the 3-6 hour mark vs the 20-48hr+ mark for AXDX....which again we all know being fast is the other key along with being right. This “optimization” perspective of looking at it is somewhat different but I think it provides interesting context because it’s how AXDX highlights their value proposition which the market treats a lot nicer. Ultimately, I believe T2 isn’t focused on presenting it this way because using clinical algorithms you get 90% coverage in the 3-6 hour mark which was part of genius behind the whole thing and ultimately getting the appropriate coverage is the thing that matters and what physicians care about.Also, to be fair there is more to optimization that just de-escalation. AST reveals the minimal inhibitory concentration which is more often like a spectrum than an absolute “this ABX will absolutely work or not”. However, this is the first time in history we are treating patients with verifiable BSI’s at very early stages thanks to T2’s ability to detect the presence of cells at such low levels. Also, this is precisely why the company is launching the resistance panel - to provide physicians with more data that would hopefully prevent the prescribing of certain ABX’s on a bug that is likely to have a high MIC for that drug (based on the presence of resistance genes).If you want to take the comparative analysis a bit further. T2s test is cheaper $150 vs $225 and in some instances the hospital is reimbursed under CPT codes for T2s test. And lastly I think the quick result timeframe is necessary for early Discharge/admit from the ED - something AXDX is claiming to hopefully be able to do in the future as stated by their CEO in his recent presentation."

Now up 20%. Any ideas about what is happening???
"I bought MAC which was also beaten down by the shorts. It climbed a little in November, but then did not do much for a month, finally today the squeeze started. AXDX is the next squeeze!"

If you own this dog you own DEAD Money. The company has never earned any net income over the last 40+ years in any of its numerous variations.
"After reading about this stock, I can't say that at this price it isn't a good buy. I'm gonna save it for a long hold."
anyone have a clue about today's action?

Yes today's action very rewarding. our company has an important machine or system to submit a blood test results within 7 hours after being admitted to a hospital. normally it would take 3 days to get the same results. So they can zap an infection immediately. Sounds good to me. let's be happy that we have another winner !
Check out after hours! Today it was just shaking off weak hands that decided to take a small profit when the huge gains are still ahead. $12 is still nothing for this company. It was beaten down so badly it now has a long run ahead. When it passes the 1B market cap many more investors will also take notice and push this further. Let’s talk again when it powers past $30
"Over 13 million shares short, todays volume is 1 million so far and much of it is investors getting on board for the ride ahead. Shorts probably still have over 12 million shares to cover over the coming days and weeks. GME effect is coming for you."
"It is not enough that your contact at the hospital/lab gives his nod to your best&bravest diagnostic instrument. What follows -and takes time- are different committees -each with their own top priorities- who have to nod as well. If you are lucky, 9-13 months later, the final decision makers will approve 2 out of the 6 systems which were requested. And back it goes for another round of negotiation... AXDX is fighting (and making progress) to cut the ""lag time"" from up to 13 months to 6-7 months, which would be great. All vendors of expensive (diagnostic) equipment will have to go through this cycle. Medtech companies selling therapeutic instruments, such as Robotic Surgery equipment, have am easier feat, since a) the benefit is more easily visible/palpable for the public and the doctors, b) surgeon (mostly) love to try out the latest stuff, and, more importantly, c) the hospital can charge a higher price, and d) there is often a very vocal ""public voice"" demanding the latest high tech Robotic equipment, ie hospitals cannot afford NOT to buy one.AXDX started marketing the Pheno System in March 2017, i.e. 9 months ago. almost per definition (see above) they cannot show big sales numbers yet by now. What is more important is the strong interest the labs/hospitals are showing in the PhenoSystem. Larry Mehren is not a guy of hyperbole talk, but when he says that based upon demand they have ""one hell of a business"" you have to listen. AXDX currently has 600 accounts interested in the PhenoSystem (& going to evaluate it or already evaluating it), with a sales potential of ca 1800 instruments (according to LM). Another interesting notion was, that in roughly 70% of those accounts evaluating the PhenoSystem, the System resulted in escalation or des-escalation of therapy, which is a surprisingly high number. According to LM those vendors providing fast ID only will just not cut it with those hospital committees which are focused on saving money. regardsDr John"
Two hours into the trading and it's up 13%. Could some good news be coming??
"someone could be closing a BIG short position, just a thought"
