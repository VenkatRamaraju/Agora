"I am starting to see what looks like actual buying rather than shorts daytrading to reposition. You can tell this when you see a size posted on the ask not scare the market down which I imagine a short would want to do and which indeed seemed to work weeks ago. For sure we are seeing hardly any selling as the stop losses have long been triggered and no longer play a role, Let the volume settle under 200K (giving us over 40 days to cover the short position). When Mr. Squeeze really comes out to play (and I imagine this will correspond to some bigger investment house getting involved followed by some broader institutional interest) it should be fun to watch this thing move. There is always a few hundred million dollars of daytrading money and much more with a slightly longer time frame that is ready to jump on anything that moves."
"The next 2 weeks should be interesting. At the very least we will get an update from the quarterly conference call. Hoping FDA approval comes prior to the call. Volume is anemic, while the stock pulled back 25%. Shorts look good right now, but this correction does not seem like it has a lot of conviction. Under 200k shares are being traded daily. Short days to cover is closing in on 40 days (based on my rough calculations). Could be a coiled spring!"
"As I have said before, this company has rarely earned a profit since its founding 38 years ago. There may have been a quarter or two with a small profit. They are currently loosing about $230,000 per day - 365 days per year. I thought the new management and products might make a difference, but it seems to be getting worse."
Well anyone wants to comment on my prediction I don’t know the future but it makes a lot of sense new device better faster and labor saving and most importantly it saves lives why buy slow labor intensive device it is like buying a 2010 honda for the price of 2018 honda it just don’t make sense
"As a physician I can certainly see the merit of rapid ID of infectious diseases. I did have a question but when I called support no one answered and got a voice mail. It appears that the unit 'Accelerate Pheno' and I might be wrong thus my question, can only process one individual's blood at a time. This is a huge red flag to me as I know how hospitals will have dozens and dozens of specimens coming through throughout the day. They would need an entire room full of these devices to take care of such processing. If they buy one or two do they just save it for the sickest patients? Then this becomes an ethics problem. If they have one device and they can process multiple 'units' at a time then there's something here."
"Squeal boy, squeal!"
Q2 Sales 1.7 million EPS -.43. Huge increase in contracts = future revenue.
$25 is a great entry point.
I have a feeling that something big is going to happen
This company over the last 30+ years has never made a profit -- maybe one of two quarters. Look at the negative retained earnings. The losses just keep getting larger.Why does this stock trade over $20?
"Volume just doubled the average. Even if it triples we still have 2 or 3 interesting weeks ahead, this is just getting started. AXDX was not deserving to be in the single digits, they have a unique product that can still surprise. Insiders would not be buying heavy otherwise"
down every day.

"After reading about this stock, I can't say that at this price it isn't a good buy. I'm gonna save it for a long hold."
hello
"Now he bought at 25.15. That was 2 days ago. What did he buy yesterday? We will know on Monday, near the close! Have a nice weekend. This stock is a slam dunk replay of Ventana from a few years back. Same players. Same investors. Same engineers. Same shortie getting hosed yet again? Borrow on the stock still 20% plus LOL. IMHO, AXDX will close the month at 30!"
"Hopefully they dont back down from this. Needless to say, we are looking forward to FDA approval, after which we plan on providing specific numbers on contracts and placements. I saw very little big prints on the tape; makes me think people are waiting till Monday night to get a sense of what they are willing to pay for AXDX , how much to buy, and what a reasonable valuation going forward is (exit strategy), How many times have we seen institutions and brokerages wait a bit before taking positions. Given that the CC is Monday afternoon that seems very reasonable. We should know in the after market....as someone will know whether its thumbs up or not as to whether there will be buying in the weeks to come including Tuesday morning."
so now they will distribute another companies instrument and test (if it gets FDA approved) somewhere in the future. More to come May 7th press conference

why is this stock going up even tho it hasnt made a profit? doesnt make sense
"Chief Scientific Officer (Humphries) sells all whooping 9,000 shares he has on June 22. That can’t be a good sign if you are a bull...."
Serious question Has the squeeze started already for this ?
"More big talk about sales and contracts, however looks like there missing 2017 revenue by over 20% of the low estimates"
"Seems top me Jack Schuler has bought $10,028,950.04 worth of the company since 10/11/17. I am sure he has it to spend but not sure why he would buy it unless he thought in the long run it would be a good investment. Unless he is unrealistic about his own company or is willing to risk $10 million at 5 to one odds to make $50 million. I am not willing to take that risk with my cash so right now I am holding what I have."
AXDX has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. if you guys have questions you should ask awesome-STOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
Two hours into the trading and it's up 13%. Could some good news be coming??
"Folks....The play in this space is AXDX for the longterm. Make no mistake about it. Research the company, the management team, and the boards track record with prior companies. (see Ventana) Constant insider buying, recently signed Mayo Clinic, AST, recently brought on Jack Philips whom was CEO of Roche Diagnostics. Who leaves a company like that to take on a position with a smaller, riskier company in Accelerate Diagnostics, in Tucson Arizona no less, unless they have conviction there is YUGE potential in the making. And he purchased $1 million worth of shares with his own $ upon taking position of COO. Not hating and not short TTOO but there's a reason it's fallen precipitously. If your going to be in this space, pick the right company. $AXDX is that company in my humble opinion. Good luck!"
"This is one of the most overvalued companies out there...half a billion market cap for $10 mill in revenue....this isn't new either. It's a great technology and saves lives, but it's just too expensive and reimbursement isn't there."
"really need to grow placements and revenue Thru 3 quarters have 167 placements for the year which is 19 per month and they think they are going to hit the low end of 300-400 for the year!! So now they will go from 19 to 44 instruments per month. Long term they will get their act together, close business and someone will buy them, not anytime soon"
This is what it sounds like when shorts squeal. -Prince
"Posted this comment on SA. The current paradigm of empiric therapy/ and pre/post culture tests can be hard to grasp. Appreciate feedback from all: And If you want quantitive evidence just look at their bacteria panel pivotal trial: https://www.t2biosystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/T2Bacteria-Pivotal-Trial-White-Paper.pdf 44% of BSI confirmed patients were on inadequate therapy - as in, their antibiotics were not treating the bug. Investors are really missing the boat on the clinical impact of the technology which is what is ultimately going to drive adoption. For some added context the impact is at the VERY LEAST as much as $AXDX and look at how the market values that company. I think AXDX has awesome technology but the discrepancy makes no sense to me. But here’s my take - AXDX’s main value proposition and what the company touts more than anything else is their rapid AST. If you look at their recent presentation on slide 5 it reads “...Study found that 84% of patient’s could have therapy optimized...” and they cite this study below it:https://idsa.confex.com/idsa/2018/webprogram/Paper72523.htmlI don’t know where they get the 84% figure but let’s just take their word for it. Just to be clear this is 84% of patients with a positive blood culture or that have a BSI.Unfortunately, we don’t have a meta analysis yet of the bacterial panel looking at “optimization” of therapy. We just know 44% are on inadequate therapy. Instead T2 conducted a separate study to look at deescalation/optimization”: https://www.t2biosystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/T2Bacteria-Pivotal-Trial-White-Paper.pdfI believe the study included 23 patients and they found 36 opportunities to de-escalate therapy or in other words a form of “optimization”. Now we also have candida infections that represent 10% of all blood stream infections where hospitals have been finding missed infections and recently on a webinar a physician said T2 cut their hospital’s anti-fungal rate usage by 50%. Now this is just my speculation but taking all of this together on top of the 44% we know could be optimized I could see the optimization percentage easily in the 50-60% range at least and all occurring in the 3-6 hour mark vs the 20-48hr+ mark for AXDX....which again we all know being fast is the other key along with being right. This “optimization” perspective of looking at it is somewhat different but I think it provides interesting context because it’s how AXDX highlights their value proposition which the market treats a lot nicer. Ultimately, I believe T2 isn’t focused on presenting it this way because using clinical algorithms you get 90% coverage in the 3-6 hour mark which was part of genius behind the whole thing and ultimately getting the appropriate coverage is the thing that matters and what physicians care about.Also, to be fair there is more to optimization that just de-escalation. AST reveals the minimal inhibitory concentration which is more often like a spectrum than an absolute “this ABX will absolutely work or not”. However, this is the first time in history we are treating patients with verifiable BSI’s at very early stages thanks to T2’s ability to detect the presence of cells at such low levels. Also, this is precisely why the company is launching the resistance panel - to provide physicians with more data that would hopefully prevent the prescribing of certain ABX’s on a bug that is likely to have a high MIC for that drug (based on the presence of resistance genes).If you want to take the comparative analysis a bit further. T2s test is cheaper $150 vs $225 and in some instances the hospital is reimbursed under CPT codes for T2s test. And lastly I think the quick result timeframe is necessary for early Discharge/admit from the ED - something AXDX is claiming to hopefully be able to do in the future as stated by their CEO in his recent presentation."
Mgmt knows the $$ and profit is in the test not the box just like the printer / ink razor / razor blade. They all came from Ventana
"Get ready, It’s coming!"
"This is a ""guest post"" from a T2 biosystems shareholder reacting to the recent controversy between the two companies, mostly caused by your CEO ditzing T2. I went back and listened to to the Accelerate CEO's 2017.06.14 Accelerate Diagnostics at William Blair and Company, and found him to be misleading and dishonest when discussing the competition. Here were my objections:1) The slide showing the competition places them all into a chart. The rows sort into faster/slower and the column sort into ID only/ID+susceptibility. My first beef here is that T2 is faster than all of the tests there, including Accelerate's, because it operates pre-culture. Mehren is being overly-generous to his own test to put it in the same speed category as T2. T2 returns a positive/negative result in 3-5 hours, before any of the other tests can even be started, if ever, given that blood culture has a 40-50% false-negative rate. T2 will be of great use in the emergency department, whereas the patient won't even be in the ED anymore when a positive BC comes back. Another beef is that Mehren mentions speeds of the non-T2 so-called ""rapid"" tests, omitting to mention that T2 is the fastest. In doing so, he tries to draw attention away from T2, which is evidently the one he fears the most.Furthermore, it is not even clear that T2 and AXDX are competitors. The tests do different things at different times. 2) Mehren states ""if you don't do susceptibility you don't get an intervention"".This is simply dishonest. The pathogens covered by T2bateria were specificly chosen to include species for which you have a substantial risk of death if you are left on emperic broad-specturm antibiotics. (E. Coli was included because it is common, however.) If T2candida shows you have a fungal infection and you are on a broad-spectrum antibiotic then your doctor will treat with an antifungal, because candida is not bacteria and is currently about 40% lethal. The choice & dose of the antifungal depends on the single or multiple species detected. 3) Mehren states ""... if you don't get an intervention you don't save money.""This is multiply deceptive. First of all, there have been customer reports at medical conferences of T2candida saving money by withdrawal of unnecessary antifungals above the cost of the test. This is a saving without an intervention. Candida is currently 40% lethal, so physicians treat many patients on tenuous suspicion of candida, for ""CYA"" purposes.Furthermore, T2 can also save money because earlier and appropriate treatment is cheaper than waiting until a patient has multiple organ failure, brain damage, and a long-term stay in the ICU.4) Mehren says ""physicials are loath to change treatment until they get a susceptibility device"".See (2) and (3) above. To be clear: I'm not trying to evaluate whether AXDX is a good investment or estimate how many lives it will save. Clearly, there is an urgent need for susceptibility testing. My point is just that dishonestly belittling T2 simply makes Mehren look bad, and it a testiment to T2's technology that Mehren must resort to deception."
parties over. Roche bought GNMK with real product and revenues
Everything came in on track. Sales are growing solid. R&D is continuing. Company is listening to customer feedback and developing variations of the product geared to specific needs. Looking forward to continued good news!
"it's incredible Jack and his boys buy a little bit, and in a month they have double the price after it got hit after pre announcement"
citron about to come out with new report. left is going to give it a right
Stock issue imminent. Annual burn rate 3x expected cash position eoy 2020.
down 5% everyday until $10.......then straight to $2 where I'll cover. getting ready for a blockbuster report on Melman
The company has been in existence for over 40 years. The company has never earned any profit in its numerous iterations. It never will.Research the history especially the B.S. around Y2k.
"Mr Shortie = Citron Research affiliates = Completely wrong thesis about AXDX fraudulent activity.Mr Squeeze = Billionaire Insiders made from a multiple Healthcare Medical Diagnostic Startups.Mr Shortie = big stock loan borrower.Mr Squeeze = major source of all stock lending inventory.Mr Shortie pushes stock downMr Squeeze allows this to happen like a fisherman feeding his target extra line.Mr Shortie has proven himself to have a lot of patience. Mr. Squeeze has even more patience and much more money.Who in their right mind would join the side of Mr. Shortie? Especially now? Some day in the near future, Mr Squeeze will recall all of his shares.The WS HedgeFund Gurus named Vinnie and Tony at major banks (it's a Staten Island Cabal) will do massive conversions and reversals in the options market to suck out more inventory (Sell forward stock by buying puts and selling calls and buying stock that they do not lend out... LOL). The $hit will hit the fan.Rebates will skyrocket t0 20+% per annum.Fails will occur en masse.Buyins will happen as per REG SHO.Clerks at banks will put buy at market order to cover fails. Chart breakout on volume attracts MOMO guys. Now imagine that this all happens AFTER the stock floats up to 30 so we have a clear breakout/breakthrough of multiyear resistance?This is going to be one major disaster for Mr. Shortie. He can probably afford to lose a couple hundred million but he won't be happy! The guy is obviously a Soros-type hedge fund to take a monster position in an illiquid little stock. Jack and John aren't Soros but they hold all of the cards. They have not shown themselves to be bluffing ever.This will happen in 2017. AXDX will hit everybody's radar. Just be patient and buy every dip."
Yes today's action very rewarding. our company has an important machine or system to submit a blood test results within 7 hours after being admitted to a hospital. normally it would take 3 days to get the same results. So they can zap an infection immediately. Sounds good to me. let's be happy that we have another winner !
"Right now all hospital Administration and Procurement are concentrating on is covid testing and instruments. Other instruments are not getting installed and validated nor are they signing new purchase agreements. So no new reagent flows, and no new instruments to create the future reagent revenue stream"
Axdx is the next. Easy 20 in 1 week
is this the old denver compaany?
"This company has never earned any money over the last 40 years. When one gimmick does not work, they try some other gimmick. They run out of money and then raise more money from naive investors. It all started with something to do with water in Denver. That did not work, so they tried something else. That did not work so they tried to Y2k B.S. The S.E.C. sued the company and management on that failure."
Any theories as to why the drop from $27s in September to $24s today? Are people just tired of waiting for FDA approval or is anyone aware of substantive concerns that would drive this drop?
"In the past month officers, directors, and friends have purchased about 3 million shares (range 17 to 21). Stock float (stock available for purchase ) has declined to about 20 million shares. Of this 9 to 10 million short: a short squeeze possible. If short advice cover now: if long be patient. mid 30s on horizon ."
"If you're short, strongly advise you to great out now - Walt"
"Very odd.... TTOO in the same type of business is valued at 100M with higher earnings ...While AXDX valued at 1,400M with lower earnings ???That is x14 times of VALUE"
One pin head holding the pps up for this. 13+ million shares held. Real head scratcher
"Revenue came in less than half of expected. I expect this stock to open lower tomorrow. It will be one of those famous ""buying opportunities."""
"There is no borrow! The last trade was at 100% The entire upside of being short the stock is now the annual cost of holding a short position! LOLOLOLOL. Glad I am not short! BTW, this is a cutting edge technology company. This is AI, Robotics and the future of MicroBiology all rolled up into one big short squeeze! We blast off AFTER we clear 30!"
"Mr Short meet Mr SqueezeMr, Squeeze: Hi are you the guy they call shortMr. Short: Actually it's Mac Short; Shorty for shortMr. Squeeze: Ok Shorty Mac Short Short what you gonna do now that Im buying bigall the info is out and the company is all set to capitalize on the approvals in US, Europe and the expert sales force they have in place. Already 4 orders within 30 min of FDA approval. You don't really think the stock is not going to break out above 30 really soon maybe this week? After that, this thing will light up every momentum trader's screen. I got lots of money, institutional money that is looking for a good medium term to long term play and a good entry. I am buying big before the momo crowd get's in.Mr Short: Well it's gonna be tough. Gonna try to short the rallies....keep them contained try to cover as I go.Mr, Squeeze: Gonna be tough. You tried that on the gap up. Over 400K according to the regsho data was short volume.Mr. Short: Yup that was me all right. Didn't do too bad. Managed to cover a little but ....Mr. Squeeze: You couldn't induce that much selling today and we ended up with that beautiful doji after the gap up and the downward action on FDA approval. That doji means...Mr. Short: yeah often that we have a reversal in the profit taking and shorting and a continuation of the general uptrendMr Squeeze: that has been more than three year in the making and has tried to cross 30 now 4 timesMr Short: Yeah gotta keep it thereMr Squeeze: Like I was saying time is not on your side. More and more people will learn of the company the stock and the technology. Like they said in the CC today this is not only faster than the competition but it uses the latest in a combination of science and high tech to give a ""99.7% positive predictive value on fresh samples in the clinical trial confirming that additional testing is.. not required...puts us in a unique position as we believe all other rapid systems require this additional testing"". I am buying now before the word spreads and everyone who knows anyone who will be working with the pheno will be talking about this. Got nothing to wait for and it's gonna be fun to see this take off.Mr Short: Umm what do you think I should do.Mr Squeeze: You cut your losses. Look for an opportunity to cover some profitable trades lately instead of digging an even deeper hole like you did yesterday. Cover right away even as I buy and you may be able to (re)sell into the rallies from the momo crowd at a higher price making sure that although you are getting a higher price you reduce your position.Gonna take you awhile and you better have some slack in your margin account..Mr Short: I got more than 8 million #$%$# shares to go...maybe I can wait till earnings and they will disappointMr, Squeeze: Larry Mehren made sure not to over promise and said consensus adjusted for FDA approval. Since approval came before the latest possible date that means some upside to the consensus but leaves it open to how much.Clearly from the excitement in his tone which he could barely contain and those 4 orders of full units (over $100K ) even that is probably under promise over deliver. Just cover and hope you can catch the momo crowd selling off to cover even more of your position. The more the delay the more you up the stakes..Shorty for short Mac Short.Mr Short: OK OK I get it..gotta hope for some lawsuit or something or that the machines break on them who knows something;;who am I kiddin'..just got to trade smart and get out of this mess starting tomorrowMr. Squeeze: Good luck Mac Short and see you at the bell. (I wouldn't cover in the pre market cause there is no liquidity and you better hope that the traders don't bid this up too high)."

"It is good that the CC is Monday. Analysts will want to consider coverage and construct revenue, income , and valuation models for the company. It appears the short position is unhedged though we can't be sure that some of the shorts have not boxed their positions. With likely revenues in the hundreds of millions and eventually in the billions there is no reason to be short the stock nor be neutral (assuming boxed).Look to price action after CC. This should be fun to watch. My fear is that I may sell too soon. In any case will keep some shares regardless of any temptation.New to this company check out the investor presentations: http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1QF4CQ/3952913510x0x896546/1C3814E3-9374-446D-853F-F810EC776589/William_Blair_Investor_Presentation_-_HiRes.pdf"
"Though I am not a physician, I am a long time investor and have listened to every conference call. The last conference call outlined a road map for AXDX to consummate sales. There's hospital administrators and clinicians and clinical directors. At no times, did they mention that individual physicians would be in their targets for sales. The physician does not realize that the intended purpose of AXDX Pheno is for secondary infections--that is, infections that are attained while in the care of a hospital. I believe that the physician is also mistaken regarding the size of the product. It is significantly smaller than the BioMerioux product that is much slower and is present standard of care."
No corona test this thing is getting crushed
Is this change on message boards permanent?
"TTOO is taking off. Things could not be worse for AXDX. It’s time to pull the plug on this one, hype can only get you so far."
At the very least
Now up 20%. Any ideas about what is happening???

"As the October 9,2016 date approaches which is 90 days after the file for FDA approval and with the stock appearing to break out on the upside technically, I would not feel too comfortable shorting the stock.

"watch out for the next short squeeze, this has been trading down for 3 months then up for 3 months for th elast few years as another trader mentioned below. We have +50% interest and +100 day cover, the next short squeeze could be epic. Already has bottomed near march lows plus the company will keep making progress. Also look at the huge amount of buys by Jack W Schuler at higher prices than today. This year he bought 10 million in the open market, no free stock options from the company."
"I am less than a novice on a FDA De Novo submission which AXDX submitted on July 11th but have researched the rules for De Novo. The following is a quote from a Washington law firm specializing in FDA approvals::""De Novo CriteriaThe draft guidance clarifies that the FDA will consider requests for de novo classification only if the following criteria are met: There is no identifiable predicate device. The device is of low to moderate risk, and general controls or general and special controls would provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. The known risks and benefits of the device can be explained, the known risks can be effectively mitigated, and the device’s effectiveness can be assured through application of general controls or general and special controls.De Novo ProcessThe draft guidance includes a discussion of the de novo process as well as a flow chart of the process at Attachment 1. As a first step, manufacturers will have the option to obtain early feedback from the FDA on the suitability of a device for de novo classification by requesting a presubmission review. Alternatively, manufacturers may simply submit a de novo application without obtaining this early feedback. Upon receipt of a de novo submission, the FDA will verify that another submission for the same device is not under review, will check to ensure that all required content is provided, and will conduct a classification review of legally marketed device types to determine whether an existing legally marketed device of the same type exists.Assuming that the submission passes this initial review, the FDA will conduct a substantive review. If the FDA determines that additional information and/or data is necessary to determine whether general controls or general and/or special controls can provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, it may issue an additional information (AI) letter. Once the FDA determines that the data and information demonstrate that the device meets the criteria for de novo classification, it will issue an order granting the request for de novo classification and specifying the classification of the device into Class I or Class II and whether the device is exempt from premarket notification requirements.The FFDCA requires that the FDA make a classification determination for the device by written order within 120 days of the de novo request.Content of a De Novo SubmissionThe FDA outlined the recommended content of a de novo request in Attachment 2 of the draft guidance. In addition to certain administrative information and supporting data, the draft guidance requests that de novo submissions include detailed information on the search for a legally marketed device of the same type (i.e., a predicate device). Specifically, the guidance states that submissions should not only include a list of regulations, approved PMAs, and/or product codes that may potentially be similar to the subject device, but they also should include a rationale for why the subject device is different from and/or does not fit within any identified regulation, PMAs, and/or product codes. Additionally, for devices proposed to be reclassified as Class II, the submission must include proposed special controls along with cross-references to other information within the submission that demonstrate that the device meets those special controls. Accordingly, manufacturers may need to determine the content of a new guidance document for special controls when preparing their de novo submission. Finally, the submission must list each risk, identify the reason for each risk, and identify a proposed mitigation for each risk.""As they mention the FDA has 120 days to respond. With a July 11 submission, the FDA would have to respond by Nov 11th, providing they had no interim questions which could further delay the response ."
"If AXDX get FDA approval , what stock price can we expect 1 year , 2 years , 5 years from now ? Anyone knows ?"
ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch... time to buy. time to cover shorts.
"@ Dan, I see his compensation stock options registered with the SEC, no purchase is stated.They will need a few years to turn this ship around and generate sales and positive earnings"
"Another $-64,000.000+ down the drain for 2017. This company has never made any money. Hype, hype, hype!!!!!!"
I listened to the conference call and what I heard the CEO stating is that management has been attempting to streamline the sales process. That they have overhauled the sales team and now have access to lots of potential customers that they haven’t previously had and that they expect sales to expand quickly. It appears they acknowledged under performance and a poor sales strategy and feel they have turned a corner. What am I missing?
You must be short?
"Very frustrating. I try to post, but as soon as I post a longer post, the system says ""temporary network/server problem, try later""... I guess, I give up for now...."
@ walt you are right. small float very controlled by a few people. they have taken this from $10.50 to where it is now in a couple of months. Imagine if they were actually hit revenue targets.
"So far this is looking like anything but a short squeeze. Longs waiting to get out is a possibility, Not that many traders have been in this so the relatively high volume should have taken them.There is lots of resistance where there shouldn't be any. So the other possibility is shorts doubling down. We should see in several weeks what has happened to the short interest.Let's assume the short interest is represented by one guy mr. short who has shorted 8M shares. Would Mr. short short 300K more to keep a lid on the momentum. I would think so.But of course Mr, Short is a fiction and there are lots of them. New ones today I imagine. However, the principle is the same. Of course if the fundamentals are there then these tactics of desperation by Mr. Short only buys him time. For traders with a short time frame this is a problem. For the others then it just adds more fuel to the fire. That's assuming the fundamentals are there. Let's see what they say in the CC next week."
Just got it above 18. Wrong time? Is this going down?
My superior sources tell me that FDA approval occurs within the next 30 days

"FWIW: I was quite amazed to see AXDX was in te top 10 positions (Nr 2, 2.42% of total holdings) of the CS Global Robotics equity fund (2017 performance so far: +40%). I scratch my head, why exactly AXDX is in a robotic fund, but then again why not....Dr John"
Looks like that market realist pr doesn’t keep up with the news. AXDX has already announced they are coming in 25% lower on revenue than there article posted today states. I would imagine all the forward estimates should also be revised.
"This is how the CEO ended the Q3 conference call....And then to our shareholders, without you none of this would be possible. Thank you very much. Together we're changing the practice of medicine. And this quarter confirmed that we got it nearly all right. We have the right product, generating high demand at good prices. And while the sales cycle is longer than we expected, we are confident that we are addressing this. And this confidence, I will tell you, is not hubris, rather it comes from working with the team that has faced much more significant roadblocks and has always knocked them down. We expect this to continue. Thanks."
The nightmare for Mr. Shortie begins! He has been played by the insiders all along!
Guys... its happening again. Saw this on the other board. Makes sense to me. 15.8 million shares short interest + 25 million share float + non-stop inside buying + accelerating product placements + 100% borrow rates + Buy-Ins + 15-20 short hedge funds running for a tiny little door + high likelihood of takeover = Doubling of Stock price in 2 Weeks! Greatest short Sqeeze starting to unfold! You heard it here first. Been trading this stock for 5 years! Made money on Every Squeeze just by watching the borrow rates...
$1.4B Market Cap and projected 2018 revenue of $21M-$30M - something doesn't add up?
"Can someone ask in the call: Why are they forcing hospital capital committees to purchase equipment up front as opposed to selling per test??

"Seeking alpha reporting rumor of buyout. Clearly no one is taking this seriously as the stock has dropped since the rumor was published, but the rumor is the Smiths Group is looking at AXDX. The source article is in the Evening Standard. While the article does not suggest a purchase price, the article notes that AXDX Directors would hold out for $35/share. The article also suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific is looking at AXDX. Full disclosure: I'm long AXDX so am hoping the story is true. I'd love a bidding war"

"As reported by Yahoo Finance today’s date 1-11-18 (Short % of Float 43.5%)To a few of you pumping this stock, things might get ugly soon with pending fda approval of ttoo device."

I believe this stock will start going down as TTOO gets closer for clearance
"It is not enough that your contact at the hospital/lab gives his nod to your best&bravest diagnostic instrument. What follows -and takes time- are different committees -each with their own top priorities- who have to nod as well. If you are lucky, 9-13 months later, the final decision makers will approve 2 out of the 6 systems which were requested. And back it goes for another round of negotiation... AXDX is fighting (and making progress) to cut the ""lag time"" from up to 13 months to 6-7 months, which would be great. All vendors of expensive (diagnostic) equipment will have to go through this cycle. Medtech companies selling therapeutic instruments, such as Robotic Surgery equipment, have am easier feat, since a) the benefit is more easily visible/palpable for the public and the doctors, b) surgeon (mostly) love to try out the latest stuff, and, more importantly, c) the hospital can charge a higher price, and d) there is often a very vocal ""public voice"" demanding the latest high tech Robotic equipment, ie hospitals cannot afford NOT to buy one.AXDX started marketing the Pheno System in March 2017, i.e. 9 months ago. almost per definition (see above) they cannot show big sales numbers yet by now. What is more important is the strong interest the labs/hospitals are showing in the PhenoSystem. Larry Mehren is not a guy of hyperbole talk, but when he says that based upon demand they have ""one hell of a business"" you have to listen. AXDX currently has 600 accounts interested in the PhenoSystem (& going to evaluate it or already evaluating it), with a sales potential of ca 1800 instruments (according to LM). Another interesting notion was, that in roughly 70% of those accounts evaluating the PhenoSystem, the System resulted in escalation or des-escalation of therapy, which is a surprisingly high number. According to LM those vendors providing fast ID only will just not cut it with those hospital committees which are focused on saving money. regardsDr John"

How do you come up with the day Oct 9th a Sunday?
"First of all let me say I'm a physician not an analyst I first heard of AXDX through a medical email of which I get more than a dozen a day. I frankly delete most of them unless the topic is of interest to me. I was intrigued with the rapid ID and read further as a clinician not an investor. It was after I learned more I thought that this in fact might be a good investment and decided to due further DD. I cannot comment on the T2 Biosystem as this is the first time I've heard of it. My thoughts are with an earlier post that over time the technology will improve significantly and a simple handheld device will eventually be available and be able to differentiate many more pathogens. This of course is years from now but it will ultimately come to fruition. When one speaks of superinfections, (a scary thought) we're talking generally about multi-drug resistant pathogens. hospitals generally don't advertise such but they do create a yearly report for admitting physicians in the community so we know what is occurring in the community and what works and what has been resistant. That being said in all honesty if a hospital reported a significant amount of superinfections I would be inclined not to go that facility if I was sick because of the increased risk of transference no matter their control procedures. Thank you all for your comments and wishing you all good health and prosperity."

"continued from previous post:Many articles referring to those ""50% negative BC"" usually cite a reference one of two review articles published in high impact point journals. either Lever's BMJ review of 2007, or Martin's NEJM study of 2003. Lever, in turn, refers to the Martin study of 2003. Now, Martin's study was an epidemiological study covering 750 million hospitalizations. The occurrence of sepsis from 1979-2000 was analyses looking at different CODES in discharge summaries. Martin et al state that ""specific organisms were recorded in 51% of discharge records over the 22 year period..."" Huh? Can we thus judge that 49% of patients had negative BC's?? I guess I am not the only one knowing that diagnoses and codes in discharge summaries often are poorly chosen, medicare at best and often wrong. So much on the value of improper referencing..."
"So, what's the big deal? How is this different than 2011 and the BACcel System? So far it seems this company just bleeds out money and makes no income. Sales of a few hundred machines is not impressive. If they sold 2 machines last quarter, then 20 the next, a ""1000%"" increase....so what?"

"Not sure who is buying today, but hard to imagine. Listen to the TTOO call regarding the BARDA contract and explain to me how this company plans to stay in business. BARDA is sponsoring/financing TTOO's development of a comprehensive panel that essentially make blood cultures obsolete - this makes AXDX's technology obsolete. Sure, you may have 5 years or so before this becomes a reality, but sooner or later the writing on the wall will be clear!"
Also the shorts are paying through the nose. Schwab is currently paying 18% and Pershing paying 25.4%

Yup 25 is an excellent entry point! Been buying here.

AXDX showing up on a top stocks for a short squeeze. GME game stop big squeeze was number one now everyone looking for short squeezes. SPCE is number 2. AXDX is number 10.
I think that we are getting ready for the next leg up. Everything that could go wrong is already priced in. We only need a small match to start the fire (Barda? Higher than expected sales? Buyout rumors?). Lets see if we can get a spike as we saw at the end of January but hopefully this time it goes higher and stays there once it reaches the top instead of coming back down.

Possibility of a short squeeze?
What’s up with this company ? Never makes a $$I wouldn’t hold over earnings. Might see $10
"Looks like we are about to get the big breakout soon. I think the previous all-time closing high was 30.56 a few years back. If we make a clean break of this level and spend a few days above 30, the Big Short is in Big Trouble! We are never going back! Remember, over 3 million shares were dumped onto the market at 28.85 just a few weeks ago."
"Last the very least we need to start a rumor that this system can help with Covid 19! LOL. That would rocket us back up, at least for a short while."
Have looked at the finra data on trading on AXDX and it is almost entirely short selling and short covering activity....way out of whack with any other stock I have looked at.
OK mr. squeeze just made his move. The large offer at 26 was eaten when it was clear it would induce no more sellers below 26. May hang out here awhile or explore who is willing to sell below 27. Stay tuned.
"Short interest slightly down, days to cover up due to weaker average net volume. What gives everyone the idea FDA will approve October or November (outside of the last company conference call)?"
This company has never earned a profit and never will. Look at its history. It has always been one thing and then another thing. Remember the Y2k fiasco and the SEC issues. It amazes me that the market never figures this out.
"Over 13 million shares short, todays volume is 1 million so far and much of it is investors getting on board for the ride ahead. Shorts probably still have over 12 million shares to cover over the coming days and weeks. GME effect is coming for you."

"Some thoughts on the TTOO-AXDX discussion:1. For Candidemia, TTOO has the fastest system for ID, being able to detect candida directly from the blood (with as little a 1CFU/ml), without the need of BC (=blood cultures). As we know, TTOO's system does not provide AST (Antibiotic susceptibility testing), but for the treatment of a fungus, such as candida, this is less of a concern, since there are only a handful of treatments available and resistance is less prevalent.2. While TTOO's system seems intriguing and has been FDA approved for candidemia, the buck stops there, at least for the time being. Test panels for bacteremia have run into technical problems and need more time until FDA submission (TTOO hopes, 2018 might be the year). It has to be seen if TTOO's technology works as well in the much more frequent cases of bacteremia. Just to name one problem: In bacteremia one deals quite often with <1CFU/ml, which according to TTOO's own indication is below their threshold for detection. What's more, TTOO's system also seems to ""diagnose"" dead bacteria. It is not without reason why all other systems/techniques (including AXDX) rely on BC as first step. 3. Some studies show that even for the diagnosis of Candida, TTOO's system has its shortcomings. In the 2016 poster of Dwivedi, Ordaya et.al. examining 200 high risk candidemia patients, 150/200 cases had negative results with both BC and TTOO; positive results in both BC and TTOO were seen in 11/50 cases, while in 39/50 cases positive results were seen either with BC or with TTOO, but not with both. Concerning this latter group, TTOO detected 22/50 cases which were BC-negative (=good) . However 17/50 cases were BC-positive and negative when examined with TTOO (=bad). In that study TTOO's system had an excellent NPV (negative predictive value) of 96% but a lousy PPV (positive predictive value) of only 33%. Therefore, let's not yet get overwhelmed with TTOO.3. Some posters on TTOO's MB continue to say that ""blood cultures are negative in 50%..."". What they want to say is, that in candidemia, blood cultures can be negative in up to 50% (therefore opening a great opportunity for TTOO's system). However when we deal with bacteremia (i.e. batteries, not fungi in the bloodstream) these ""50% BC-negative"" look more like 0.3-3% BC-negative, depending on the technique/medium used.4. AXDX' system is not without drawbacks either. One main problem comes with the fact that the test-panel provided by AXDX does not cover ""all"" bacteria, but only a pre-specified selection of the most frequent ones. While the Pheno-system seems to be sensitive and specific IN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE BACTERIAS PROVIDED ON ITS TEST PANEL, some bacteria are not being tested with the bacteremia panel and therefore cannot be diagnosed with the Pheno-system (the same applies to AST). As to AST, the Pheno-system, there have been reports that the Pheno System might become inaccurate when it comes to polymicrobial infections. However, overall the Pheno-System has very good sensitivity (>94% ) and specificity (>98%) concerning ON-PANEL-organisms, with a NPV of 99% and PPV of 88% . According to one study the Pheno-system OVERALL yielded ID in 92% and AST in 73% 5. Due to these results some authorities say that the PhenoSystem cannot just yet replace the SOC (traditional methods of ID and AST). 6. As to the huge gap in market cap bight between AXDX and TTOO: True, TTOO might be undervalued and AXDX might be overvalued. On the there hand, the market is more often right than not... and why should TTOO have to issue shares at a 20+% discount, if the future were so bright?regardsDr John(PS: long AXDX, no position in TTOO)"

Wow this has held pretty strong since the earnings release and the market in general.
"I find it very interesting to go back and read some of the MiMedx longs messages that are still posting on this thread. If you read what they said couldn't and wouldn't happen - has happened. Now, they are trying to convince themselves that the shorts lied and are continuing to lie, or the problems aren't as bad as they say. In addition, anyone who happens to take an opposing view is part of the so-called ""short and distort"" campaign against the company. Pete, Bill, Mike, etc are no longer with the company - FACT. IMO, this was Pete's company with his HAND PICKED management team and Board of Directors. Since the Board of Directors decided to release those individuals, then they must know the magnitude of the situation. The company seemed to sue everyone or threaten to sue everyone (ex-employees, Osiris, Joe Munda, Shorts, LR, etc.) - and then seal court documents (was everyone lying under oath?!?). I know Pete is still on the board, but why?!? Some think it's tied to the future liabilities and insurance. I don't know why, but we should find out soon.In addition, the main MiMedx Cheerleaders have disappeared. Ask yourself why?!? The 50+ million shorts aren't small time players. Good luck to everyone who continues to hold - you'll need it. $OSIR $MDXG"

As I said Mr.Short added to his position after fda approval. Mr. Squeeze is sleepin on the job letting shorty do his thing. Here's what he does every morning: Puts a short sell on the ask and unboxes his short position by selling the stock down after he might get a few bites on his short offer. He gets algorithms to sell along as well as triggering stop losses. Then he boxes his new short position by buying it up at a profit to the morning sells when the stock stops selling off. Now triggering buys he puts a new short on the offer. He now has a new boxed position he can unwind the next trading session. As long as Mr. squeeze is asleep he can do this virtually forever. When the price gets low enough Mr. Squeeze will wake up and reverse the process on our friend Shorty.Some news about new placements will give Mr. Squeeze some allies and put Mr. Short in his place. We can only hope.
Oh by the way the lack of sale is I believe due to TTOO system because it is better faster and much much more accurate
