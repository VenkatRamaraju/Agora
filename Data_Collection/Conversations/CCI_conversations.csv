Hoping it gets hit hard after earnings so I can add more.
Not a great report. They guided lower and missed on revs
Excellent Earnings. Raised Guidance and to stock falls Unreal
"I can understand a small pull back. CCI has had a great run so a little profit taking is expected. Although the ER was a beat across the board with the only caution being they much busier than ever handling the workload (understandably so). With that said, nothing but record growth and expansion ahead. IMO, one of the best positioned REITs as an infrastructure play and even more so for 5G/6G implementation."
"one of the directors just bought $1,500,000 in stock for himself and children and grandchildren at $130 a share. Seems like he believes in the long term story investing for kids and grandkids"
...at this point I'm in $AMT & $CCI to cover my 5G investments. anyone know the company that makes the component that makes the new 5G chips work?
BUY BUY BUY
"So, CCI inks what looks to be a big contact with Dish & yet the stock goes down."
"Looks like $200 is in the cards within a year,. Coupled with an upward adjustment to this year’s expected AFFO, 5G coming on, dominance in the growing small cell market and expected 7%-8% annual increases in the dividend for years to come, this stock is a keeper."
"Anyone knows the increase valuation today? Though i read about Elliott investment recommending fatter dividend. Any takeover rumor or other possible reasons, It has been one of my largest reit investment with the necessity of the cellphone in modern life n the the 5G future."
Down another $3 on a big up day.
Down on high volume today....does not bode well for Monday !
Some always buy the rumor and sell the news. Stay for the real growth and dividends!
Good ER !
Why has this stock been dropping so steadily?
11 weeks ago I bought in @ $125 and asked people to wish me luck 3 of you did.I added today @ $135 so will you please wish me luck again ? 
Long and strong
"With projected EPS of $1.23 this FY 2018, how is CCI paying a $4.20 dividend? Can one elaborate? Thanks."
"New to REITs but does their cash flow after dividends scare anyone especially considering their large amount of debt, or will the company continuously issue equity like they have done in the past to keep their cash balance stable, while bringing their debt down slowly?"

"LA: Do you NOW feel better, since you are up to date on analyst coverage of CCI?(curiously you deleted your post with stale data and hence my reply--well played!)CCI 12 Month target: 194.39Target prices range from perennially bearish Mstar's 110 (next lowest is Wolfe Research's 162) to a high of 224.Of course, price targets are just that."
"I really want to take a bite, but I am not at all sure now is the time. I have a feeling I may regret waiting. I'm just waiting for big hedge funds to sell. That's usually my ""all clear ahead"" signal. Almost every trade I take now is to fade the big money; that are never right, including Warren Buffett. Kraft Heinz? IBM? Lots of others too."
Hmmmmm.....Cramer's Investment Club sold out the rest of their position in CCI. Will be interesting to see if he ends up being right or wrong?
I have to be more careful which stocks I buy and sell that Kramer recommends.￼
thanks a lot Cramer for recommending this stock as a good hedge for the September sell off .. couldn't have picked a worse stock by using a dart board!
Very glad I chose to invest in CCI over AMT. I get a nice dividend in additional to capital gains. First batch of shares was purchased in the mid 90s. Haven't looked back since and will continue to add on the dips.
"The fact that he sold here rather than north of 200 tells me he isn't ""right""."
CCI conf call extremely bullish dividend over 3.5% buy and hold for 2022KeyBanc overweight this morning $204 price target
"At $126 if they were to increase the divi by the amount they've committed to (7-8%) the yield would be pushing 4% at 3.87%.This......... Due to the elongated construction timelines, we now expect to deploy approximately 10,000 small cells in 2019, which is at the low end of our prior expected range of 10,000 to 15,000, but approximately 30% more than what we delivered last year. We expect the increase in tower activity, offset by longer small cell timelines, to generate higher expected AFFO per share growth of 8% for 2019, up from our prior Outlook of 7% growth and at the high end of our long-term growth target.""...............................is a temporary blip in a positive long term trend."
Just buy it and hold
I'm seeing a 10% increase in the dividend. Am I missing something?
$1645-$167 I'm a buyer
Jefferies cut the price target from $231 to $223. Still a strong upside percentage from here.
What's going on with this...Why the downward slide?

"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has launched the 5G Fund for Rural America, putting up $9 billion over 10 years to expand high-speed wireless broadband coverage in the US. The FCC plans to hold multi-round reverse auctions in two phases to bring 5G coverage in areas that lack it, and to close the digital divide in the US. The FCC fund's approval follows its April proposal to make $9bn available to bring 5G to rural areas that would probably not be delivered 5G broadband. Regardless of who wins this election, the gov will invest in 5G infrastructure to compete with China"
Similar bump in the div as last year (and greater than the year before that): 1.33 from 1.20 or 10.5% increase.
"This company is a hidden Gem.As of today the price is 156.,Lets see how it will be after 6-9 months."
Hmmm- from down 2% then the CC & up 1%. something nice must have been said.
Argus has a sell rating with 174$ price target! Any thoughts on why?
