"Massive buying opportunity in the country's largest natural gas producer. Do people understand that the company is not offering shares in this offering ie no dilution. After nearly a decade of natural gas being sub $3, it is not over $5 and much of the world is already reporting a shortage before the winter heating season has even begun. Coming from this industry is very significant experience in the cost to drill Marcellus an Utica Shale wells, they are largely un or marginal economic at sub $3 gas. At $5 gas, the returns sky rocket, they are not linear due to high fixed costs."
EQT is closing in on 52 week high and there are 20 million+ short shares that will need to be covered.
Buy CTRA forget all the other heavily hedged Natural Gas stocks. Hedges will drag on their earnings ..... CTRA is unhedged and profiting fully from higher prices .....
This company “hedged away” most of its gas price “upside” for 2021 and 22. If you betting on current gas prices either holding or increasing into next year there are better companies in this space. Antero has a IR presentation slide showing “who has what exposure” to below market hedges.
"listened to conf call from Q2 earnings. seems they r trying to restore the balance sheet to become investment grade. Analysts see PT $24 - $30 / +17 tp +40%. With peak season around the corner, supply low n demand high....IS NOT EQT A STRONG BUY? Im no expert in NG, just seems like natural upside....What do you guys say?"
"PLUG Energy used dilution and market timing to dilute share at opportune times and invest in amazing projects. They have an unbelievable war chest that will ensure their existence. EQT smartly did the same. In just a day or two, the shares will recover"
Charts for 39 on this. Grab before next run starts.
"Slim, hold on. Natural gas is the bridge fuel. EQT will get past this share dilution and surely someone will take the checkbook away from MR Rice before he buys Gulfport!!!!!"
"Today, 10/25/21, was a good day for EQT. It was up more than 5%. And that rise was just 2 days before the release of earnings. Maybe somebody knows something. Lol."
"One day, essentially 30 million additional shares are traded - to me that is dilutive. Doesn’t matter where they came from - the date the shares hit the market, my shares were diluted 9% or so. And the day they hit the market EQT was down $1.34 while similar companies like COG was up $.94. Also showing the dilution. And the marketing department at EQT should really love their jobs. Selling their gas for sub $2.50 when it’s over &6. It is their job to know the market and they failed miserably on their hedges. Miserably. They should be looking for work."
"The total sales volumes hedged is proving to be an issue now. Assuming they could increase Q4 volumes by accelerating the remainder of the 2021 program (maybe by bringing on a couple of temporary non-electric frac crews) without significantly impacting 2021 capex, how much unhedged volume would they have to accelerate in order for it to really impact the bottom line? I don't think there's enough to make a difference.There would obviously be a penalty if they had to stand-down frac crews in November/December to keep the total 2021 capex and frac count even(ish)."
EQT looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
Wow.... Range Resources RRC now almost has the market cap of EQT
"Nice offering of Alta people for $20 a share. Very interesting that it is trading above that. I would hope to add below 20, would not pay even 1 cent above that..."
"It’s really quite sad. ~ 80% of next years natural gas is hedged at sub $3. Rice admits he was wrong. That and six bucks will get me a cup of coffee at Starbucks! Rice held the former CEO accountable and pushed him out. And nothing he did affected the worth of our shares like the horrible hedges Rice has put in place. And we will be affected for the coming year. I don’t expect marketing to lock on the absolute top dollar but sub $3 - people have to be held accountable. Starts at the CEO. If MR Rice was playing MLB and hitting 180 with zero home runs, he would be out of a job. These hedges, swaps, collars, etc is like hitting less than 180 for over two years. Work with end users to drill additional wells along with EQT’s budget. Lock in $4.50/$5 price for five years. Surely your Land department has permits ready. Stop whining and do something. Lennon said’”There are no problems, only solutions.” Fix the problems or get out of the way. I’m very serious in this - my dog Milton and I can run this company better."
EQT just formed today a bullish Continuation Diamond chart with upside rise possible to $27 - $28.50 over the next 5 months.
"EQT Executives , please talk to us. Explain your hedging strategy. Explain the two acquisitions during the past year that raised your debt but don’t appear to be assisting earnings. I have held this stock in spite of leadership as I wagered on natural gas prices hitting $5 and I wanted the resulting windfall. Well I won. Price is $5. And EQT share price hasn’t rewarded me. MR Rice, why? I’m so confused."
"here's some price history on EQT : .55 when started in 1979, $38 in 2008, $58 in 2014, $7 2019, 20.62 today.Could it match it's all time high, probably not. Could it reach 1/2? That would be $29 and that's what analyst have as it's price target. Has some nice charting action, the world's supply is LOW, winter is coming.35% - 40% upside is reasonable and expected."
I can't believe EQT can't hit new highs with spot price over $6.20 and SO MANY SHORTED SHARES.
The 2 main issues for EQT Corp I see is that Equitrans is behind on the MVP pipeline and natural gas price curve looks to have set in a clear top and now is deflating. Positive thing is the stock is very cheap due to doubts about its guidance relying on the MVP pipeline coming on midyear 2022. Will be interesting to see how this pans out.
