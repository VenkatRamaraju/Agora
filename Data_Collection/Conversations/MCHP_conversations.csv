"I am starting to doubt the adequacy of these analysts, today UBS gave 154$ target... Is it ok that prices are halved now? Or how should we read it?"
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."
"Big 142.55K share profit taker around 3:30p. Still involved with $MCHP, good to roll."
"Interestingly, they downgrade further 1 day before the split. They will have to change price target again in 1 day... Recently there were very positive webcast presentations at microchip's website especially citi's conference - now all are gone, wonder why is that."
One of the underradar stocks I’m holding
"MCHP to Present at Credit Suisse ConferenceMicrochip will present at the Credit Suisse 23rd Annual Technology Conference on Wednesday, December 4, 2019 at 8:00 a.m. (Mountain Time). Presenting for the Company will be Mr. Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. A live webcast and replay of the presentation will be made available by Credit Suisse and can be accessed on the Microchip website at www.microchip.com. The replay of the webcast will be available for a period of 14 days following the presentation."

"read an article today: ""analysts see ample upside in microchip""... Mentions 155$ and 154$ price targets and 115% upsides. And the price has spiked up already... Automatically generated articles for automated trading systems... based on robot analysts with indian names. Investing circa 2021."
"Strong fundamentals, less supply chain issues compared with non-fab competitors and cleverly responded to chip shortages with a (PSP), which, back in Aug accounted for around 50% of scheduled production. I think one can safely assume that percentage has gone up. To increase production in the face of the recent flood in demand￼ MCHP has brought packaging in house [ArgusAnalysis, Aug 5th 2021]. An effective, low cost way to get product to customers￼￼ faster. In addition to the added manufacturing capacity acheved ￼ in the acquisition/integration of Microsemi back in 2018, the debt from that acquisitionIs is fast becoming a thing of the past￼ & their investment is beginning to pay off. …and as far as that downgrade from Wells Fargo? Garry Mobley just doesn’t like company’s affected by systematic risk. Good luck finding any of those in today’s market environment!￼ So yeah, as you can probably guess by now, Me like! It’s going to take a place in my portfolio, alongside INTC￼, which got there through￼ similar (but not identical) reasons. (Your thoughts? Criticisms?)"
Morgan Stanley gave 95$ target. At least they know about the split.
"don't worry about $TXN slow down. It is exposed to several categories, like analog chips, which already weren't growing. $MCHP $ADI $NXPI."
Why are the financials so hard to locate? Pass
"Split works, it is growing better than peers. How primitive these markets have become..."
"Why do they downgrade... Have they listened to the most recent conference?! 60 weeks lead times in some products, upcoming split then again."
"Well I do understand downgrade but I don't agree with it. The thing is that there will be 2 very positive quarters now it is sort of given and then they probably expect things to return to normal + Q1 is not the strongest quarter seasonally overall. So in other words they expect a normal kind of cycle here. But I think it is not a normal kind of cycle - did you hear before about production halts due to semiconductor shortages? While other firms like $MRVL, $MCHP, $ON forecast very strong demand for 2022 I am sure business will be booming here as well, because firms are reluctant to increase their production capacity significantly - not to get into overproduction when things improve - instead they try to outsource production for the time being where possible. Then again next year will have a significant momentum in consumer PCs and servers because of rotation to DDR5 and new processors, mobile also should be strong because of further expansion of 5G, cause many people still haven't rotated to a 5G phone."

I'm in!
"I have opened a position here. While I think $MCHP is a better play for this particular cycle, this company seems to be better positioned long-term and cheaper than ADI + Maxim."
Does anyone know on the day of the actual split what the price was? I am new at this and I am trying to figure out after they announce a split what happens? I guess the price on announcement day means nothing? The stock splits and on that day the price is just cut in half? Please help me undertstand.
Bullish on the earnings. MCHP did pre-announce and hope they will have a spectacular outlook as most semicons are. MCHP lots of potential as the most diversigied semicon supplying across various industries. Did my dd here and really expecting a good ER tomorrow.
