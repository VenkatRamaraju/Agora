Time to rise
I just got in this company. I hate their products but they sit heavily on market and are greedy as hell.
Wow. I am puzzled....but I will continue hold and the worse will be over!
on sale
"What happened at noon today? ADSK rose big time, both price and volume."
Probably close at 305 today. Earning reports is extremely bad.
"Soon it will bounce back to 330+. Great company fundamentally, dominant in AEC industry, and 50+ PE is not high at all compared to peers"
$ADSK Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 266 » USD 269 Target Raised by Barclays Overweight USD 335 » USD 340 Reiterated by Canaccord Genuity Buy USD 330
"The way it dropped yesterday I knew it had to be some kind of news. So, today we see Morgan Stanly down grades it. Now we know what happen. Morgan Stanley cut Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) price target from $334 to $324. Autodesk shares rose 0.3% to $304.20 in pre-market trading.The support I see is $277, good luck to all."
ADSK sports a huge level and a huge PE ratio. Expect it to drop significantly more.
Why does this not provide a PE?
Well it is 2:40 PM they claim they are going to pass the Infrastructure bill today!! Keep your fingers crossed!Would be nice to see DC doing something the country needs!
"my son who is in high school convinced me to buy this stock! when he's done, he will have had 4 years of Autodesk tools training. i hope they keep educational tools free, great long term enabling. great long term subscription model. Why is this stock so volatile? it's not like anyone is going to ask for a refund on their subscription on a down day... or huge signups on a good market day... but if any part of that infrastructure package passes, i think this would be a huge catalyst. the recent pullback i think is just indicative of how shortsighted the market is, they basically just gave themselves more net revenue."
Goldman's is not aware of the new administrations $1.3T Infrastructure/Construction plan?
"ADSK may have close to a 50 PE, but the idea that it is expensive is quite untrue when you compare it to its long term growth rate of 35 percent. This is actually growth at a reasonable price folks. There are massive returns ahead for those who are patient, in short."
ADSK is risky and going to the path of dropping.Be caution.Drop now!
This dip is a welcome buying opp. This company has complete dominance over the A/E/C industry with no real competition.
"Well from $347 to around $285 pretty good hair cut, depending on the market tomorrow it could be a good day to buy. If the market goes down big on the down side I will load the truck with 1/2 of what I'm prepared to use for this position. Should be a good entry point! It may take a few quarters to gain back the drop but 6 months will go by pretty fast for a good gain. Becoming bullish."
150 today
ADSK has been oversold for far too long. I expect a bounce back this week. Hopefully it can recover above $310 in the next few days and begin upward climbing back towards $340+. Autodesk products are the standard in their industry....especially as more licenses for their software grows over the next year with more remote workers than ever. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Today is going to be bad
"May be a tad early, but I'm a buyer on this pullback."
"When blocks over 10,000 shares are getting bought, you want to be buying on this blip of a pullback under 310. Keep buying. Keep holding."
"Autodesk had a great quarter. They are set for explosive growth and have very little true competition. They have an excellent management team. Their growth willcontinue to accelerate for years. Review the last quarter for yourself. Aside from the fact that it is a great company perfectly positioned for bulletproof earnings growth, look at the 1 year chart. It’s oversold and landed on the bottom of the trend line. It’s good for a 5% bounce in the short term anyway. Then it will continue its steady climb up. This fall from 340 is a rare gift. At these prices it’s a no brainer. The fundamentals of the company and the technicals of the chart scream buy now. Even the newly reduced price targets are up in the 300s. This little crash today should have finally washed out all the folks getting margin-called from last week. The nimble money managers will start biting tomorrow by 1030. The more conservative bigger guys will wait until after the long weekend when it’s a little safer and start moving in. Make no mistake, it will not stay under 300 for long."
I have no position in ADSK but I am a customer that is being ripped off by them and am very happy to see them hurt here.
"Autodesk did a great Subscription model transition. $NFLX is the proof this IS the next financial model for IP. Right now $ADSK is spending a huge amount of money to get on the Cloud. There is no competitors to their softwares in the Construction, Autocad/Revit, and the entertainment industry, 3DsMax/Maya. The new Cloud platform is name FORGE. Please keep shorting, and I’ll keep buying more, been using Autodesk products for over 28 years now, they have their own issues, for sure, but they know where it’s going ;)"
Autodesk reached an all time high at 229.93
"As someone working in the designing and machining industry for 20+ years, I see Fusion 360 becoming the industry standard for CNC programming. Affordable and extremely capable for its price."
"For the entire month, this stayed at 287-293 area. Shiaaat"
"To better support our customers facing the new reality of working remotely, we’ve introduced a special Extended Access Program for several of our cloud collaboration products, including BIM 360 Docs, BIM 360 Design, Fusion 360, Fusion Team, AutoCAD Web and Mobile, and Shotgun.

Nice ! $302.00 . There will be some taking $$ off the table but this stock has had good results.
Love the product but .49 cents a share book value is not something I like.
Very strange. I heard the earnings call and management was bullish and was on target to meet full year guidance. 1 st qtr is variable but full year was good so this seems as overreaction. Buying opportunity
"WOW and good day, looks like we held at around $278, now if we can build a base and add a little more; after todays gains it will be higher for sure. I did not see any news today, maybe they decided it was over done to the down side. Also up in after hours. Fingers are crossed."
"ouch, earnings was not kind to them"
"Not too much room to go up, but lots of room to go down. Earnings were good, but not quite good enough for where it’ stands with valuation, expectations for growth, and the current technical situation"
Started my position at 286. Let’s go

Entry point
"Every architect and engineering firm in the US uses this software. Every student of architecture and engineering learns their software in school. It'll have its ups and downs, but it will not be displaced as the go-to software for an entire industry. Long and strong here."
have they been buying back shares?

"As expected, buying up shares under 310 was key. Once 314 is broken, this will close in 320s today. Keep buying. Keep holding."
My short order 146.22 just got executed.
Opened my initial position today. This company has no other competitors and the products with new subscription model are solid cash cow. Infra bill is still drifting but this company will benefit from the digitalization of construct industry too.
Doubling my position in ADSK under 290. Extremely oversold. Keep buying. Keep holding.
"OK, this could be a little Bold..!! Can we call the bottom here?? Lets all hope so!"
I bet we open $-26 and immediate spike up and will end the day down maybe $-10
Not even “down $100” yet this week
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"Somebody just dumped 240,000 shares at the mkt... timberrr!"
They had some interesting insights about ADSK on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"ADSK's support line is at 285, and there's no chance of a market reversal with such a solid company. This is the perfect time to buy."
"How is a company with $2.5B revenue and negative earnings for half a decade command a $32B market cap? There was a time when this stock was well worth it's price, but not in this decade."
"Wake up.....this is the tech slide. Happened to crm, to vrw, now adsk"
"Besides being the leader in software for design, drafting, visualization for architecture/ construction/engineering, and 3D software/prototypes, they also have a fast growing software division for VR/3D Animation/Motion graphics for gaming industry. https://www.autodesk.com/industry/media-entertainment/game-design-and-development"
Huge beat !
Mommy!
"Still the leader with a wide moat:Autodesk’s flagship product, AutoCAD, has been available since 1982 and is undeniably the granddaddy of CAD. To word it better, AutoCAD is to CAD what Photoshop is to photo editing.The program comes packed with an array of features that make it a versatile tool for several industries, including graphic design, engineering, architecture, and project management. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that AutoCAD is the go-to product for professionals, hobbyists, and students."
This stock is on fire!
$320 to begin the year $280 now this could be the only tech stock down 10% this year 2021; congrats  if you are short
9.05% ABOVE 200 DMA - Looks like / feels like a bottom is forming for next leg up - Cheers!https://finviz.com/published_idea.ashx?t=ADSK&f=082721&i=ADSKd121098699i
what is happening to this stock? Dumping...
What a BUBBLE!
will hit 400 after ER
"I am not surprised by this decline. I work in an engineering firm and with the subscription model companies do not require as many licenses as before. In a firm that had a 1000 engineers and designers before every computer had to have the software installed. Now licenses are shared so a 1000 person firm my only need half of the licenses as before. Analysts don't understand the dynamics of this and think they will have as many licenses sold on subscription as they had in loaded software on a computer before. Engineering firms are also getting really good about managing those subscriptions to make it such that they buy only as many as they need, which is less.I was going to short this going to earning but did not and have no position as of now, but that may change as this is really overvalued."
"My favorite stock in the whole market.... $ADSK SUPER BULLISH SHORT TERM, MEDIUM TERM, & LONG TERM"
Only crashed 15% this week and people are complaining not bad at all 5% more ADSK will be in her own Bear  market
Bubble stock that hasn't made profits for ages. How can a company cannot show earnings selling a needed product?
The stock is bouncing all over the place...Anyone on the call?
buy buy buy buy opportunity. 300s in coming weeks.
"Some notes from Jefferies, dated 9/02/21We attended ADSK's investor day and came away incrementally positive on the growth prospects of construction mgmt. software.. Construction Cloud Represents Massive Opportunity To Drive Sustainable Long Term Growth. ADSK highlighted in its investor day presentation that Construction Cloud represents a $16B TAM.The bottom line is that the TAM for construction software is huge. Furthermore, data from Deloitte's Global CIO Survey in 2018 indicates that the construction industry lags other industries in digitization and will play catch up over the next few years. ADSK mgmt. highlighted that the Construction Cloud grew mid 30s in F21.International Expansion. ADSK noted a 20% increase in specialized partners specifically in Latin America and APAC to serve the international market. I need to point out this one comment = ""That TAM for construction software is huge."" Note TAM = Total addressable Market My son is a full partner in a asset management company he sent this to me yesterday.Good luck to all longs!"
It seems some people lost money here! Thats why short strategy doesn’t work sometime. Just call it a day and the stock is not gonna go down after the amazing report and will hit $141 in matter of a few days. Many analyst increased the price target as well.
shorted 500 @ 124
"Autodesk is like Adobe, strong strong presence in entertainment it’s not gonna change either, these are the Pepsi and Coke"
What is with the after-hours drop another $5 bucks???? I guess Congress is going to increase taxes by 500% on the working class!!Both parties need to be eradicated! Time to start over!! Also Term limits!!
"When you look ADSK’s almost 40 percent earnings growth rate over the next 5 years, all of a sudden the 150 PE doesn’t seem unreasonable."
"Very simple here, longs: autodesk has no rivals in the A/E market. Students are spoon fed the software and firms use the same software. Anyone who thinks that there is a real reputable rival is blowing smoke. Believe me, I’ve been using the software for 25 years. It’s THE industry leader"
Booyahhh!! Bought 200 shares at 132.20. Just unloaded. Nice quick $1000. Almost up for my foot locker $38 buy on Friday.
Lets hear this earnings calls in 30 minutes
$ADSK has been consolidating nicely and is slowly changing momentum back up as more buyers move in. Keep buying under 312. Keep holding.
The company has posted fictitious numbers through accounting tricks!
ADSK $344 to $280 in a few weeks is down 20% bear market crash
"Sold some stock at 330 over a week ago....Talk about an implosion of mammoth proportions... wow, 58 points in 7 days! What is happening here?"
"Who is long ,here"
Berenberg raised Adsk price target to $370 from $310.
I’m holding tight to my puts contracts. This stock is going down beyond 274 if there’s any downgrade .
"300 PE ratio, no growth, no innovation, just claims to have a monopoly on autocad, which will go away someday. How anyone can buy or hold this valued at $40+B when rev is 2B and profit is 200K is laughable."
A yummy dip buy god bless fickle people
"Bought this stock at $289.21 on 9/2, and still waiting. The recovery from August 24th's 52-week high has been slower than expected, but this stock is only going up from now on. Expect a huge 14%+ boost after the spending bills pass in Congress."
"Great Company, Stock is way overpriced; Wall Street too optimistic. Needs to come down 25%."
Why are analyst's growth estimates for the next five years so high (Next 5 Years (per annum) 35.58%)?
And this is why you sell both the put and call together. Stay above 130 and below 170 for another 2 weeks please.
bought in
"New highs going into earnings, very good sign."
ADSK beat on earnings...
"3 day rule, maybe pick some up tomorrow at $300"
"They underestimated forward guidance. The selloff was unjustified, they will continue to grow and the reopening of the economy will only speed this growth."
ADSK set another all time high today. Will it hit $350 per share any time this year?
Buy as much $ADSK as you can afford under 310. This is a bargain. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Awful earnings report!
Expect the down trends continuation tomorrow.
I hate to say it but looks like support is $277. Hope it holds there and stops this slide!
"My post 2 months ago:“Got into this stock just four years ago at $33, therefore it owes me nothing. My reasoning was that it was a stock which had a moat around it and that still applies. In its field it’s like a monopoly. Down to $142 from its high of $170+. It may drop a bit more, who knows, but it will be a steady gainer over the longer term. It may have dips along the way but there is no company anywhere near to compete with it. IMO don’t be distracted by negative comments. DYOR”A nice 20% gain.This will continue to steadily climb for a long time ahead. Architectural practices working on projects of hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars want the best tools and the cost of Autocad is “a drop in the ocean”. Moreover ADSK have teams of proven software specialists and will bring new and successful products on board."
Looking at $360 by January
there we go to $20
$320 to $280 in 2021; employees are hard enough to come by especially when your stock never goes up 
"What the shorts don't know is that ADSK is transforming the Construction Industry the same way ADBE transformed the creative industry. Autodesk is building tools that in the the future, will significantly reduce design costs for construction. Imagine an engineer designing the HVAC system and then immediately fabricate the ducts for installation. This is not the future, this is now and Autodesk is making it happen. They will reduce costs through 4D construction and any company who doesn't have it will not be able to remain competitive in their industry. AutoCad/Revit is at the forefront and leading the way."
Any predictions on how the stock's gonna be tomorrow after the report?
"I work with it everyday and there simply isn’t another product like it in the 3D modeling world. It’s applications span from robotics to (primarily) construction. BIM 360’s architect-engineer integrated consulting views has the potential to disrupt the way buildings are designed for the foreseeable future. (I don’t own ADSK, just a genuine fan of the product)"
What is going on with this stock. Is Bentley Systems or some other competitor eating their lunch? I knew I should have sold back at $335.00
"Looks like we hit a floor, several days we have based out around $287, barring a complete market melt down we should be good to go. A lot of shares traded around these prices. Time for a talking head to mention this is over done."
I'm working software to compete with Autodesk and revolutionize the building industry. Wish me luck boys.
On the bottom line this is a loosing company. I don't understand why people are willing to pay more and more for this and similar companies.
Release the Hounds!!

The dropping is caused by the target lowering.
"Looks like the dummies in DC are going to fail on the infrastructure bill!! It is a needed piece of spending!! The country needs work on Roads and Bridges, also the Power Grid. DC has been talking about for years, but the left wingers are going to kill because they can't get their Social spending bill passed. The 3.5 trillion Social spending bill is nothing but a waste. They better pass what they can, give up on the Social waste bill!!I have to think this is what is going on with ADSK for the last few days."
Another revenue stream for Adsk: https://adsknews.autodesk.com/news/introducing-flex
"Off to buy 5 shares! My SIL, a civil engineer, was interviewed for their Blog / Newsletter and is such a cheerleader for ADSK. My daughter was even consulted and asked for imput on improving the Build Program when they absorbed PlanGrid."
Strong buy from here. Easily 320 before the next earning. Accumulate.
The time is with the shorts. Be patient!
"Best way to take advantage of this bogus market with limited risk to loss moneyShort $QQQ, Long $SPY. When Spy Hit 220 again QQQ will 150 because this time only reason SPY go down because big giant tech suddenly find that corporation who bleeding money and getting closer to bankrupacy suddenly cancelling all those must have subscriptions and limiting cloud usage.When that happen (Most think never going to happen, I think must happen unless all those company suddenly get business back and start making money) expect $AMZN to trade $1200, $APPL to trade $180, $MSFT to trade $100, $NVDA to trade $100, $ADSK to trade $80, $OKTA to trade $50, $NOW to trade $100, $TWLO to trade $100 and list will go on."
"There are numerous alternatives to Autocad, even some being sold by ADSK. Revit and Inventor, for example, are used as substitutes for Autocad. Outside competitors such as Solidworks and SolidEdge are mopping the floor with both Autocad and Inventor. Low-cost Autocad clones such as Bricscad and ZWsoft are rapidly gaining Autocad marketshare. ADSK's costly acquisitions of non-CAD analysis tools such as Moldflow, Nei Nastran, etc. all have slumping sales with key developer departures. The overemphasis on Autocad shows ignorance. Autocad sales probably account for half or less of ADSK sales these days.Bottom line is AutoCAD stock is trading 13X sales with no profit and slow to no growth in revenue during a booming engineering bull market."
Big win today.

"Can anyone explain this: not just for this stock, why don’t analysts know better and adjust their estimates more timely what companies they follow are doing? Big surprises like this indicates that they are pretty clueless. What are they being paid for??"
Time for ADSK to pay a dividend.
"@D I don’t understand your remark, “ADSK has a product that several other companies also provide.” AutoCAD is software which any architect worth his salt uses. It is a product which has a “moat” and cannot easily be challenged without an amount of expenditure on competitive software creation and selling costs that could never show a return. Still a lot more upside to this stock, albeit maybe at a slower pace than the past five years but one to tuck away for a long time to come.The only danger is that the BOD do not harm this cash cow by looking at ways to repeat its last five years at the same growth rate."
Nice....every other company with ER today killed it! Well done
For some reason at about 3:00 pm the bottom fell out!Any News??

Just got an email from ADSK saying that my subscription pricing is going up ~3% a month starting next month. Glad i've made more than that with the stock!
It’s too expensive. It will probably close at 286 today.
Great buying opportunity for a great company. Simple as that.
this stock is gonna pop 8% tonight after ER
