Wow. I am puzzled....but I will continue hold and the worse will be over!
"Above 50MA now, bullish!"
"OK, this could be a little Bold..!! Can we call the bottom here?? Lets all hope so!"
Doubling my position in ADSK under 290. Extremely oversold. Keep buying. Keep holding.
"As expected, buying up shares under 310 was key. Once 314 is broken, this will close in 320s today. Keep buying. Keep holding."
What is with the after-hours drop another $5 bucks???? I guess Congress is going to increase taxes by 500% on the working class!!Both parties need to be eradicated! Time to start over!! Also Term limits!!

"ADSK's support line is at 285, and there's no chance of a market reversal with such a solid company. This is the perfect time to buy."
Started my position at 286. Let’s go
"Bought this stock at $289.21 on 9/2, and still waiting. The recovery from August 24th's 52-week high has been slower than expected, but this stock is only going up from now on. Expect a huge 14%+ boost after the spending bills pass in Congress."
To the moon...
"Autodesk had a great quarter. They are set for explosive growth and have very little true competition. They have an excellent management team. Their growth willcontinue to accelerate for years. Review the last quarter for yourself. Aside from the fact that it is a great company perfectly positioned for bulletproof earnings growth, look at the 1 year chart. It’s oversold and landed on the bottom of the trend line. It’s good for a 5% bounce in the short term anyway. Then it will continue its steady climb up. This fall from 340 is a rare gift. At these prices it’s a no brainer. The fundamentals of the company and the technicals of the chart scream buy now. Even the newly reduced price targets are up in the 300s. This little crash today should have finally washed out all the folks getting margin-called from last week. The nimble money managers will start biting tomorrow by 1030. The more conservative bigger guys will wait until after the long weekend when it’s a little safer and start moving in. Make no mistake, it will not stay under 300 for long."
"Looks like we hit a floor, several days we have based out around $287, barring a complete market melt down we should be good to go. A lot of shares traded around these prices. Time for a talking head to mention this is over done."
Release the Hounds!!
I hate to say it but looks like support is $277. Hope it holds there and stops this slide!
I’m holding tight to my puts contracts. This stock is going down beyond 274 if there’s any downgrade .
If we can stay above 308 today.. going to 319 next week.. otherwise falling down to 301

"my son who is in high school convinced me to buy this stock! when he's done, he will have had 4 years of Autodesk tools training. i hope they keep educational tools free, great long term enabling. great long term subscription model. Why is this stock so volatile? it's not like anyone is going to ask for a refund on their subscription on a down day... or huge signups on a good market day... but if any part of that infrastructure package passes, i think this would be a huge catalyst. the recent pullback i think is just indicative of how shortsighted the market is, they basically just gave themselves more net revenue."
"Sold some stock at 330 over a week ago....Talk about an implosion of mammoth proportions... wow, 58 points in 7 days! What is happening here?"
Opened my initial position today. This company has no other competitors and the products with new subscription model are solid cash cow. Infra bill is still drifting but this company will benefit from the digitalization of construct industry too.
"Well from $347 to around $285 pretty good hair cut, depending on the market tomorrow it could be a good day to buy. If the market goes down big on the down side I will load the truck with 1/2 of what I'm prepared to use for this position. Should be a good entry point! It may take a few quarters to gain back the drop but 6 months will go by pretty fast for a good gain. Becoming bullish."
Nice come back today!! Now we are talking!
$ADSK has been consolidating nicely and is slowly changing momentum back up as more buyers move in. Keep buying under 312. Keep holding.
ADSK has been oversold for far too long. I expect a bounce back this week. Hopefully it can recover above $310 in the next few days and begin upward climbing back towards $340+. Autodesk products are the standard in their industry....especially as more licenses for their software grows over the next year with more remote workers than ever. Keep buying. Keep holding.
Looking at $360 by January
"WOW and good day, looks like we held at around $278, now if we can build a base and add a little more; after todays gains it will be higher for sure. I did not see any news today, maybe they decided it was over done to the down side. Also up in after hours. Fingers are crossed."
"Some notes from Jefferies, dated 9/02/21We attended ADSK's investor day and came away incrementally positive on the growth prospects of construction mgmt. software.. Construction Cloud Represents Massive Opportunity To Drive Sustainable Long Term Growth. ADSK highlighted in its investor day presentation that Construction Cloud represents a $16B TAM.The bottom line is that the TAM for construction software is huge. Furthermore, data from Deloitte's Global CIO Survey in 2018 indicates that the construction industry lags other industries in digitization and will play catch up over the next few years. ADSK mgmt. highlighted that the Construction Cloud grew mid 30s in F21.International Expansion. ADSK noted a 20% increase in specialized partners specifically in Latin America and APAC to serve the international market. I need to point out this one comment = ""That TAM for construction software is huge."" Note TAM = Total addressable Market My son is a full partner in a asset management company he sent this to me yesterday.Good luck to all longs!"

This dip is a welcome buying opp. This company has complete dominance over the A/E/C industry with no real competition.
"The way it dropped yesterday I knew it had to be some kind of news. So, today we see Morgan Stanly down grades it. Now we know what happen. Morgan Stanley cut Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK) price target from $334 to $324. Autodesk shares rose 0.3% to $304.20 in pre-market trading.The support I see is $277, good luck to all."
adsk set to take off above 310.15
"I've been very bullish on $AFRM and $SOFI for a few months as they both have been gaining market share at various websites I'd visit. So the $AMZN partnership announcement on Friday was no surprise. I sold my $AFRM over $100 this morning for over 45% gain and moving it to $SOFI and adding even more shares of $JWN under 29....Nordstrom will be back above 38 in the short term in no time. I have also added more shares to $ADSK, which I expect to be back above 340 also in the short term.Keep buying $JWN, $ADSK, $SOFI. Keep holding."
"May be a tad early, but I'm a buyer on this pullback."
"Soon it will bounce back to 330+. Great company fundamentally, dominant in AEC industry, and 50+ PE is not high at all compared to peers"
"Off to buy 5 shares! My SIL, a civil engineer, was interviewed for their Blog / Newsletter and is such a cheerleader for ADSK. My daughter was even consulted and asked for imput on improving the Build Program when they absorbed PlanGrid."
Why are analyst's growth estimates for the next five years so high (Next 5 Years (per annum) 35.58%)?
Well it is 2:40 PM they claim they are going to pass the Infrastructure bill today!! Keep your fingers crossed!Would be nice to see DC doing something the country needs!
Entry point
"When blocks over 10,000 shares are getting bought, you want to be buying on this blip of a pullback under 310. Keep buying. Keep holding."
