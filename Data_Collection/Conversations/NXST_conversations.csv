Sold out in early Aug but looking to get in again on any market weakness. Think the gambling deal and ad revenues ahead of next years mid term election could be great Just hope i get a chance in the lower 140area
"The announcement of the buyback program is interesting occuring a month before earnings are released. The guide is already set for a monster quarter. If NXST were projecting a miss or a lower forward guide, it would have made sense to save that buyback program news. The stage is set for another great year."
"Some of my takeaways from the call:1. They indicated they will repurchase around $500M shares this year, assuming there are not any acquisitions out there.2. Very little mention of News Nation3. Some local advertising markets like NY are still lagging. Automaker advertising is also lagging4. They made a mention of a recent double upgrade from the S&P, but I'm unable to find that information publicly5. In general a solid quarter with $500M on FCF, which is unheard of for a $6B company"
"sold out my position , did very well with this stock but was not comfortable holding a 150 dollar stock with vague growth opportunities in this type of market. Wish all of you best luck with it"
"SportsGrid Network equals $$$$, good timing by Nexstar to partner & enter the sports betting and fantasy sports industry. ""SportsGrid Network will be distributed across nine digital subchannels licensed to Nexstar in nine major U.S. markets."" Good luck & great investing!"
BOUGHT IT AGAIN at 149 hope i didn't screw up
Is this a monopoly
"Nexstar Media Group, the No. 1 owner of local TV stations in the U.S., topped Wall Street’s first-quarter forecasts as advertising momentum before the coronavirus carried the company to a 177% surge in net income.Total revenue in the quarter ending March 31 was $1.09 billion, edging consensus estimates for $1.07 billion. Diluted earnings per share of $3.30 easily beat analysts’ expectation for $2.86.Advertising revenue shot up 87%, boosted by political spending, to reach $472.7 million."
"Can't wait for their earnings with all of the political spending. This company is so well run, signing carriage deals almost monthly (Youtube TV, Vidgo, Hulu, FuboTV). That NBC deal getting extended is a risk taken off the table. As a company, they have 400% revenue growth over the last 4 years, P/E of under 10 (with that kind of revenue growth?!), Forward PE of 8, PEG of 0.16, great analysts’ ratings, etc. NXST should benefit as the economy reopens and with Olympics this summer, there are some serious advertising tailwind."
"Referring to an article titles, ""Supreme Court Hints It Will Let FCC Relax Media-Ownership Limits"" from BloombergIn late June we will hear the fate of these cases. This would be huge for NXST both increasing the changes of them getting acquired, but also allowing them to continue to expand to smaller local markets. I'll be curious if this changes their FCF allocation over the next 6 months."
"Sell at your own risk! Earnings from $3.24 in 2017 to $7.50 projected for 2018 and $8.20 projected for 2019. The historical PE is 18. Also, Apollo has approached NXST about a buyout. NXST will be rising in the next few weeks it appears to me."
"Solid report. Short term stock price meaningless. Keep printing money, growing revenue and buying back shares and it’ll all work out in the end. Great job management."
"Great management, terrific earnings and the stock trades at a 7PE . Investment community sees little future growth . Future ad revenues face severe competition from large Tech digital platforms. Cable agreements will decline and be less profitable. Where will future growth come from?"
"$SBGI $TGNA $AMCX $VIAC $DISCA $SSPFollowing trade press reports late last week, the WSJ says big advertisers are now set to exercise cancellations options for Q3 network ad spending. Kantar Media shows weekly ad spend was down ~40% y/y throughout April. We think the upfront process is unraveling, and as we reported yesterday scatter pricing is also down considerably and could put advertisers in a position to push for 2020-21 upfront pricing that's down y/y and/or below scatter. The WSJ says marketers remain concerned about the economy, and about future programming (likely including both entertainment and sports). The article says new ad contracts will include more flexibility around easily cutting spend if a new wave of coronavirus impacts economic activity."
Political ad revenue will drive profit and revenue through the roof
"nxst earnings were great, stock even after today's move still has an 8pe. At conference no one asked about stock split or why they feel buying back more stock would be in the best interests of shareholders. with an average cost of 80, i sold 200at 140and will hold my remaining 600 shares to see what happens"
The acquisition of The Hill is a great move. The Hill is a great publication and has tons of synergies with NewsNation.
Political spending will be $10.9 BILLION this year up from 7 billion in 2016. A big part of this is going to TV ads. Really bullish for NXST. NXST will rocket higher at earnings Nov. 5.
WGN was added to YouTube TV on Tuesday
"While no longer a holder of NXST i still keep a close eye on it hoping for a chance to get back in . This weeks Barron's has a feature article on Gray Television in which Nxst briefly mentioned. While Gray is a much, smaller co. they do operate in a similar environment."
