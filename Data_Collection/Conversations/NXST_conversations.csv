NXST is the best acting stock in my portfolio. Wonder if it is too late to add more at this time.
All of these broadcasters seem like absolute steals right now. NXST with a forward PE of 7 with expanding EPS and top line growth.

"On fire today, roaring back to 130."
"Low key forgot I was long on this but that's the kind of approach you must take to NXST haha, trust in the all knowing God of technical analysis and worship at the alter of Chartism and forget you own it for a few months to a year. Hopefully we get good earnings, and hopefully it responds well to that. Impressive comeback with decent potential going forward. Wish everyone good luck!"
Apollo has approached NXST about a buy out is what I see now.
why does this stock sit there like a value stock when it is not at all !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NXST is up 12.30% to 56.99
"Great management, terrific earnings and the stock trades at a 7PE . Investment community sees little future growth . Future ad revenues face severe competition from large Tech digital platforms. Cable agreements will decline and be less profitable. Where will future growth come from?"

Thank you dish network for removing Nexstar stations. Nexstar is way out of line and perhaps should be broken up.

"Wow. The family is watching antenna TV on Thanksgiving. A day to relax, spend time with you family, not watch politics, or any of our cities burning, and Antenna TV runs ASPCA commercials with the dreary Alyssa Milano crying about mistreated animals. If you want to help more animals, fight for lawful restrictions on pitt bulls, so that dogs that do not fight, or dogs that bite their owners, do not flood the kennels. This one breed is responsible for 90% of the costs. If the ASPCA warned people about buying cute little pitt puppies, that often turn on their owners, the ASPCA would have more than enough to take care of mistreated animals. People who are well funded defend this breed, and instead of defending it, they should be paying the ASPCA for the overload they are helping create."

With such a small amount of shares held by the general public it is difficult to buy or sell the stock without moving the price .Even a trade of a few shares can result in a sizable change in price. I don't know why they don't split the stock and make a more marketable investment for the average investor

"Some of my takeaways from the call:1. They indicated they will repurchase around $500M shares this year, assuming there are not any acquisitions out there.2. Very little mention of News Nation3. Some local advertising markets like NY are still lagging. Automaker advertising is also lagging4. They made a mention of a recent double upgrade from the S&P, but I'm unable to find that information publicly5. In general a solid quarter with $500M on FCF, which is unheard of for a $6B company"
Nexstar Media reached a 52 Week low at 67.32
"Solid report. Short term stock price meaningless. Keep printing money, growing revenue and buying back shares and it’ll all work out in the end. Great job management."
"$SBGI $TGNA $AMCX $VIAC $DISCA $SSPFollowing trade press reports late last week, the WSJ says big advertisers are now set to exercise cancellations options for Q3 network ad spending. Kantar Media shows weekly ad spend was down ~40% y/y throughout April. We think the upfront process is unraveling, and as we reported yesterday scatter pricing is also down considerably and could put advertisers in a position to push for 2020-21 upfront pricing that's down y/y and/or below scatter. The WSJ says marketers remain concerned about the economy, and about future programming (likely including both entertainment and sports). The article says new ad contracts will include more flexibility around easily cutting spend if a new wave of coronavirus impacts economic activity."

I hope to never watch a Nexstar station again. It has been off the air where I live for almost two month and I am getting used to not watching the local CBS station.
"Nexstar Media tonight LOST ALL Las Vegas DirecTV customers while demanding outrageous price increases.... as if there were 300% inflation. Reaction by most DirecTV customers is BYE....c ya, there is better programming elsewhere. PIGS get slaughtered."

Political spending will be $10.9 BILLION this year up from 7 billion in 2016. A big part of this is going to TV ads. Really bullish for NXST. NXST will rocket higher at earnings Nov. 5.
sell！
Why has this stock taken off??
Let the upgrades roll in. $120 next step up.
Cup and handle formed?
NXST is up 5.08% to 77.50
Back to 130 very soon.
"""Nexstar Broadcasting Group (NXST) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.13 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.42 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 66.41%.....""Forecast:""The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.02 on $1.05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.42 on $4.35 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year......."""

This thing just keeps going
NXST reached a 52 Week low at 59.57
this is a joke
"Don't understand , last week up 12 bucks with one day trading over a million shares. This week by mid Tues it already lost over"
got an HD antenna. got all my local channels back. 56 dollars... including ABC
Election is going to a blood bath. Political TV advertising will shatter records with virtual conventions and limited pandemic rallies. Donors will empty their pockets to get their candidate the only exposure they can.
"Sell at your own risk! Earnings from $3.24 in 2017 to $7.50 projected for 2018 and $8.20 projected for 2019. The historical PE is 18. Also, Apollo has approached NXST about a buyout. NXST will be rising in the next few weeks it appears to me."
So no one cares that the News Nation network is and will be a bust and a complete financial drag on this company for years to come? Cause it seems like NXST is in it for major long term. Sell the network and make money now before cable dies even more.

Political ad revenue will drive profit and revenue through the roof
Why is it down today?
I wonder what Ironman thinks now...............
"The announcement of the buyback program is interesting occuring a month before earnings are released. The guide is already set for a monster quarter. If NXST were projecting a miss or a lower forward guide, it would have made sense to save that buyback program news. The stage is set for another great year."
Sold out in early Aug but looking to get in again on any market weakness. Think the gambling deal and ad revenues ahead of next years mid term election could be great Just hope i get a chance in the lower 140area
WGN was added to YouTube TV on Tuesday
5 aug. report! It will be :rocket

What's the story for Nextstar after the election? I think the market is judging it to be negative. Is that accurate or no?
"TV political advertising is going to be a massive spend this year with huge profits for Nexstar. No face to face rallies etc., the only way to get to the electorate is TV."
"finally catching a sustained bid, hope this is the beginning of the re-trace to $130+"

"Nexstar Media Group, the No. 1 owner of local TV stations in the U.S., topped Wall Street’s first-quarter forecasts as advertising momentum before the coronavirus carried the company to a 177% surge in net income.Total revenue in the quarter ending March 31 was $1.09 billion, edging consensus estimates for $1.07 billion. Diluted earnings per share of $3.30 easily beat analysts’ expectation for $2.86.Advertising revenue shot up 87%, boosted by political spending, to reach $472.7 million."
"John Muse is a Sick and Greedy Low-Life trying to gouge the American people by removing a lot of tv stations from Direct tv and Dish network and Cable companies trying to force them to pay $1 Billion Dollars to air the TV stations like Fox 46, the name of his Company is Nexstar the other company is Apollo. All of this is going on during the Pandemic. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOUR PRIORITIES! JOHN MUSE YOU SICK LOST SOUL probably a LIBERAL MINDED DEMOCRAT THAT SUPPORTS NANCY, AND AOC, AND MOST LIKELY HAS BEEN TO EPSTEIN ISLAND.....WITH BILL....."

"NXST is losing DirecTV customers big time, a huge loss of ad revenue"
"Per DISH, Nexstar seeking 100% rate increase for the local NBC channels. BOO to NXST!!"
"The 2 year chart shows a perfect cup and handle. I am not a big chartist, but it is hard not to see it. Any ideas when we might hear something about the buyout talk?"
That PAC money is gonna come in big.
"nxst earnings were great, stock even after today's move still has an 8pe. At conference no one asked about stock split or why they feel buying back more stock would be in the best interests of shareholders. with an average cost of 80, i sold 200at 140and will hold my remaining 600 shares to see what happens"
"This message from AT&T to all DirecTV customers with blocked stations due to Nexstar's demands: To our TV customersWe’re grateful we’re your TV provider. We want to offer you the best TV experience at a value that also makes sense to you.Nexstar wants to nearly double the retransmission fees we pay, which we cannot accept while still providing choice and value to you. We’ve spent the past weeks making multiple good faith proposals, but Nexstar is still trying to force us to accept an unreasonable price point, knowing that it could directly impact you.What’s more, Nexstar claims that it offered us an unconditional 30-day extension. That is not true. Nexstar’s extension would have required us to accept a proposed fee increase and even apply that increase to a period of time that has already passed. We will continue to meet with Nexstar this week.The Nexstar playbookNexstar pulls or threatens to pull their stations from the customers of TV providers to increase fees for stations far beyond their value. They’ve done it to Cox Cable, DISH, and Charter Spectrum, and now they’re doing it to us.The four major broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC) have together lost about half their primetime audience over the past few years. Despite this, Nexstar is demanding the largest increase that AT&T has ever seen from any content provider.By asking us to pay even for viewers who choose to receive Nexstar stations for free over the air or through other means, Nexstar is also reducing consumer choice. For a company seeking to become the largest broadcaster in America, this is behavior that should not be rewarded.We’re fighting for youYou’ve sent a very clear message that you don’t want to keep paying for channels you don’t care about. We agree that you deserve more choice over which channels you want to pay for, and the freedom to decide where, when, and on what device you can watch shows you enjoy.We appreciate your patience while we work this out with Nexstar. These types of disputes are often resolved quickly, and we hope that will be the case this time. We’ll continue to provide updates here to keep you informed about our progress."
"Referring to an article titles, ""Supreme Court Hints It Will Let FCC Relax Media-Ownership Limits"" from BloombergIn late June we will hear the fate of these cases. This would be huge for NXST both increasing the changes of them getting acquired, but also allowing them to continue to expand to smaller local markets. I'll be curious if this changes their FCF allocation over the next 6 months."

The acquisition of The Hill is a great move. The Hill is a great publication and has tons of synergies with NewsNation.
"I'm a DISH customer, and we just lost our local NBC station channel because Nexstar, owner of local NBC station, wants a 100% rate increase, and DISH is not agreeing to pass along unwarranted increased rate to customers. The hell with Nexstar's ridiculous price gouging attempts. I'm going to get my local stations by antennae and not rely on DISH providing local stations and not pay increase sought by Nexstar."

"Can't wait for their earnings with all of the political spending. This company is so well run, signing carriage deals almost monthly (Youtube TV, Vidgo, Hulu, FuboTV). That NBC deal getting extended is a risk taken off the table. As a company, they have 400% revenue growth over the last 4 years, P/E of under 10 (with that kind of revenue growth?!), Forward PE of 8, PEG of 0.16, great analysts’ ratings, etc. NXST should benefit as the economy reopens and with Olympics this summer, there are some serious advertising tailwind."
