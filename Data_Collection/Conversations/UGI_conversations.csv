"this company has been around since 1883, first dividend payment in 1886, i own over 2k shares, i am really unhappy with what is happening to this company, the managment even moved the annual meeting ans time to make it harder for shareholders to come. i guess they didnt want to hear gripes, one good thing, many of the options that the CEO's pay is tied to are worthless. i hope john feels the pain."

Are insiders buying or selling? What is Marvin and Bort up to?
Does UGI ISSUE K1 at the end of the year
a good marriage for UGI would be with PP&L. it would be a marriage like Aqua America buying Peoples Natural Gas.
yesterday I got sick and tired of holding my nose owning UGI after being a APU partner for YEARS !sold and took my LOSS !!I hope someone is very happy.
"UGI up 18% YTD, and up 68% in one year! Div hike coming again next Q, divs paid since 1884... #1 propane in the US and Europe.. what's not to like? %^)"

I smell a stock split in UGI's not-to-distant future. We'll see.

What id wrong with this dog? Price goes down every day.
"AmeriGas will do well this Fall, Winter, Spring as outdoor dining only for restaurants will need to provide portable heat at outside tables. Buy some UGI stock, and get an extra cannister or two for yourself before there is a shortage."
Complete garbage
When is UGI going to finalize APU stock holders? Are they waiting to make money on interest to help them pay? SEC should have a rule to make these deals done within 24 to 48 hours!
We must interpret a bad temper as a sign of inferiority.

"When I consider all the dividends over the last few years of APU, I've made out as a bandit. Now will relax for the next few weeks and see what UGI has to offer. GLTA"
I'm now by force a UGI stockholder. I voted AGAINST the merger...……..Any of these board members recommend this stock?
This is not good. Down 2.75% the day before earnings
"yowza, UGI is bangin back today.. I've been buying it on the drop, because it is a div rock like few others...div paid since 1885!, increased for 34 years straight, at a 5yr.DGR of 7.7%.. the payout ratio only 50%, low for any utility. They've got LNG locked up in the USA and Int'l., #1 brand here and Europe. Plus midstream NG, electric and HVAC for more diversification. Divs are a paycheck for me in early retirement... I need it constant, reliable and increasing. UGI fits the bill baby..."
"UGI is up >20% YTD, and 60% in one year, not counting divs.. not too shabby %^)"
A new all-time high in a huge down day in the market. Impressive. Hopefully they will declare a stock split and/or a huge divy boost.
"another acquisition, another hit to the stock price"
i am tired of reporting being done by NON-GAAP measures. that tells me the accepted accounting is not being done.is it smoke and mirrors? i say yes.
Best stock to own the next years...
"Looks like I hit this one out of the park. Very bad earnings report, stock down over 7% in the AH session. I only wish I had shorted more than 400 shares, but still, a nice wallet fattener. I'm holding this short until late afternoon tomorrow. Stock should go down even more tomorrow, anywhere from 10-20% below my Short Sale price of $46.25. Been on a winning streak lately. My next big earnings play is DHI to the long side, expecting a very good earnings report and a rise in the stock price, tomorrow morning."
UGI is now up 15 consecutive trading days! Up >120% from the low of the Covid crash... heading to the Big L %^)
UGI is down 5.16% to $54.00
You would think the early cold weather would affect the stock price. Not here.
"I'm glad to see the price drop today- I sold a JUL$50 CC a while back, but I don't really want to sell what has been my best performing utility by far, up ~150%, not counting divs. My thinking was now that I'm newly retired, and use IRA divs as my paycheck, <2% div for a utility is just to low. If I can keep the shares, I can just write another CC higher, for more income."
"Dividend coming 01/01/21, hold on everybody. 2021 is the turnaround year for this sector. All aboard!UGI Corporation (UGI) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for December 14, 2020 - DEC 11, 2020 9:00AM ESTUGI Corporation (UGI) will begin trading ex-dividend on December 14, 2020. A cash dividend payment of $0.33 per share is scheduled to be paid on January 01, 2021. Shareholders who purchased UGI prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. This marks the 3rd quarter that UGI has paid the same dividend. At the current stock price of $35.45, the dividend yield is 3.72%.The previous trading day's last sale of UGI was $35.45, representing a -22.45% decrease from the 52 week high of $45.71 and a 62.99% increase over the 52 week low of $21.75.UGI is a part of the Public Utilities sector, which includes companies such as Enbridge Inc (ENB) and Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

Zacks Investment Research reports UGI's forecasted earnings growth in 2021 as 7.12%, compared to an industry average of 2.4%."
"Wow, fantastic report!"
"Gonna sell this Short going into earnings. I expect a bad earnings report, poor guidance, and a drop in stock price to the low 40's. I think I'll do 400 shares, this baby is looking weak and the chances of an EPS beat of the consensus estimate is very low, IMO."
"I'll say it again. What a dog. The market is up 250 points now, and this dog is down a stick. Come on management, you gotta do something here."
What a dog. The market is up huge this year and UGI has gone nowhere.
"I was going to sell after the merger, but decided to hold. I like the idea of no cut in dividend during 2008-2009 time period. Also, I think NG and Propane will rise in the future."
"I owned a good amount of $APU stock. INDEED, ""owned""--past tense. Any of you that also ""owned"" $APU stock most likely feel the same as I toward $UGI. You probably also know that $APU and $UGI had the SAME CEO and ""shared"" the SAME Address.Presently, I have Z-E-R-O faith in this ""company."" Now, attempt to convince me WHY I should feel differently."
"According to the slide presentation, they forecast $4.05 for 2023. There is a lot of integration savings and cost given the acquisitions. For 2019. Some good news, EBITDA was only down 4.2% even though EPS showed poor Y/Y comparisons. Nowadays cutting a forecast results in computers just dumping. I have owed this stock for a long time. They are aggresively transforming the company which is a good thing. That means they are paying attention. If they earn $4.05 in 2023 and it sells for 16x in 2022, our compound return will be 19%. I am willing to hang in and add for that kind of risk/reward."
propane is not the same as NG
Hilarious to see UGI website- they offer Scratch n sniff brochures!! Now that explains everything!
"Zacks said up 1.5%. From when they stole my Amerigas stock, gave me 2/3 worth of cash and the rest in this looser. When I was given UGI it was at $53, but I could only sell for about $20 and change. I've held hoping that it would go back to $53 (the price of the UGI given shares at 1/3 the cost of Amerigas funds). Looks like a looser to me at the current price."
earnings come out tomorrow. i wonder if they will declare a stock split. 2 for 1 would be nice.
UGI reached a 52 Week low at 37.95
UGI reached a 52 Week low at 33.00
Done with UGI. I along with other Amerigas holders that was duped into buying for a guaranteed distribution and then totally screwed with a cheap buy out and then get stuck with another bad trade with UGI. Took my loss and will never buy propane from either company again!
"yowza, UGI is banging back up again..."

"UGI up again! It's heading to the big L and more, nearly 3X the return of S&P500 YTD, with >2X the div yield, diamond rock solid divs, increased yearly, another div right ahead. Not too shabby..."
Fantastic dividend stock!
"mu-hah-huh, looks like my plan is working.. I made an earlier post about selling a 21July$50 CC. I don't really want to sell shares, but it is overvalued and yield would be <2%- for a utility that's too low. My guess was that $50 would be a short term high. Looks like that will stand. So I got the premium, and prob keep the shares- to sell CC again at a higher strike price. UGI has been vely good to me..."
"Lost over HALF of my dividend income with the merger with UGI. I'm supposed to feel good about this? I was dead-set against this merger. Unless UGI raises its dividends back to what APU was paying, I got screwed!!"
UGI is up 4.95% to 36.06
"UGI up big on a big down day for utes. It is still waaaay below it's historic avg.P/E (FV). The Dividend King of Kings, rock solid divs paid out without fail since 1885!, and raised yearly for 33 straight years. Works for me in my early retired increasing div paycheck IRA ports.. %^)"
"Been a shareholder for a month due to the method or their prorated conversation. Asked for all cash, got 32% in cash and UGI shares. Sell order has been riding at the cash conversion price which may ar may not be reached (it is lower than the UGI 52 week high). UGI paid their increased dividend today $.32/share, but only to Shareholders of record August 8. No converted UGI shareholders receive this. This whole buyout smells bad with APU and UGI managements reaping the rewards.The vote was a given due to UGI corporate and both managements control. Any info on class action suits?"
New all-time high. Well done UGI!
get ready for a stock split soon
I made a comment on underground gas lines installed by AmeriGas. It was removed. Just wondering why? Is Is it ok to not do the right thing?
I hope it does not split. If it does the 2 options to get .50 shr or .63 shr for each APU share at the sale would be a very bad deal.

"yowza, picked up more @39.75 this am, 2 days before ex-div with $.33 locked in ...works for me %^)"
"yowza.. I'm up 27% in ten months, plus a 3.97% div yield.. on a rock solid increasing div machine that's put out divs for >100 years, and raised them 25 years straight, with a 5yr. annual avg. DGR of 8.1%. PR still <50%. Works for me! %^ )"
"At this point, UGI should have a stock split. It's gone high enough."
Buy here on the drop. A stock split & a big divy increase will happen soon. JMHO.
Why is other stocks are now going back up this morning. UGI keeps wanting to screw the stockholders over. Hate this company!!!!!

"WHY is John Lawrence Walsh Jr. still around? After RIPPING me off by causing my $APU stock to get absorbed into this $UGI (Pronounced UGLY) company, I haven't even seen anything close to recovery of my LOSS. In my opinion this man and his bunch of PARROTS that are on the BOD's with him are dishonest. John Lawrence Walsh Jr. was the CEO of both $APU and $UGI at the SAME TIME and both so-called ""companies"" had the SAME ADDRESS and SAME PHONE NUMBER. As usual, it's ALWAYS and FOREVER the small investor that gets RAPED."
UGI is up 8.67% to 30.85
"yowza, UGI is returning to FV, it's still way below.. Dividend king of kings, paid a div for 136 years straight!, and increased it for 34 years without fail. 5yr average DGR is 7%.. works for me %^ )"

"Limit buy set for $35.20. That would be a 3.75% fwd yield, increasing yearly.. that would work for me %^ )"
The price of propane is out of control. This stock should go up to $45 when earnings for this Q are announced.
I agree totally Rick. I too had a large holding of APU. Got screwed on the merger big time. Now this mess. What next? Chapt 11
UGI is down 5.12% to 32.27
UGI is up 6.62% to 34.46
"yowzah, up almost 10% today... I was buying it down last Friday and through the Covid-crash no fear... a co. that just jacked the div for the 33rd straight year, and paid it for >130 yrs. straight.. I think we'll still be cookin with gas.."
"They announced the dividend, where are the earnings?"
I got out of UGI at 50.20 today. So overall with the merger and dividend I made out okay. GLTA.
I got some UGI shares and some cash as part of the conversion - I noticed the cost basis changed and it's much lower than what I paid for APU... does anyone know what's the tax consequence of this share conversion?
"UGI is proving to be the dog of my portfolio. I'll be lucky to break even, after all is said and done."
"Using cash plus stock to buy Amerigas! Hmmm, don't see where they would announce a split but they likely will dilute current holders to pay APU holders. See them add to the float!"
"I don't like what I see in the numbers and time to dump all my shares. Loved Amerigas, but not UGI."
Wow!
Does anyone else think that 2.36% yield a good thing? It's still the dog of my portfolio!
UGI is down 7.67% to 24.06
Just remember some of the board members are the same ones that allowed APU share holders to lose a lot of money by not looking out for their best interests. They will probably have their own self interest in mind in the future. Don’t have much trust in them.
"As a propane user, I like to check various supplier prices and reviews. looking at Amerigas, it looks like they have some problems with customer relationships. Look at the fees for rental, and for using enough gas during a year, and disconnection fees if the tank is over 5% full, etc etc. Rented tanks require minimum yearly usage, or you get an additional fee. It looks like everything is spelled out, but whats spelled isn't all that great. How about that 7.99 fee for calling and asking for a delivery. Looks like UGI wasn't making decisions till recently, but propane is not a utility. people can change suppliers. Hate to see UGI be like that.https://www.amerigas.com/terms-and-conditions"
"Personally, I'm getting tired of these ""so-called legal"" MANIPULATIONS by what my opinion sees as GREEDY CROOKS bending any and all rules to screw the investor. $UGI did to me and my $APU stock what ArcLight Energy Partners did to me and my $AMID(American Midstream Partners LP) stock. $AMID's CEO was ""kindly"" given a good position with ArcLight Energy Partners. How precious!!! In $UGI's case, $UGI and $APU have the SAME CEO---how convenient!! Should have been illegal. Again, in my opinion it appears that the SEC is in bed with these people, and the small investor is, like always, left ""holding an empty bag"", while the ""top-of-the-pyramid"" group dance, all the way to the bank. Again, I experienced the same ""apparent"" scheme, because $DRYS also did pretty much the same thing, ""internally"", while its CEO party'd. All I share in this post is just my opinion, and I was LONG on these three companies. Am I the only one seeing this?"
"Up scope on UGI, $40 and beyond.. dividend King of Kings, paid out divs every Q since 1884, increased yearly for 35 years straight..5yr. avg annual DGR >8%.. rock solid inflation smashing div income works for me %^ )"
"yowza, up >5.5% today alone! sweet...."

Where's the stock split?
"I sold a APR$25 put for $135.. that's >10%APR on my secured cash...not too shabby. I'd take the shares @$25, with a rock solid 5.25% yield, no problem."
UGI is up 6.31% to 26.94
I wonder if UGI will split its stock soon
"Come on UGI, go down! No I'm not a short, I'm a shareholder but sold a $50CC and the shares were bought. I'd like to get in at a lower price. UGI has been my best performing ute, by far."
"You guys are all correct. I believe most of the unit holders of APU got a bad deal. Not only did we loose a good source of dividend income, we were taken for a unwanted ride. I knew the all share deal would be a bad deal so I opted for all cash at the cash rate of 35 and some cents, but only about 32% of my units were cashed, rest was went through share conversion. Now I have no idea of how long we got to wait for UGI to go up. Who ever is not interested in holding the shares will keep selling and that will put pressure on the share price. I feel really bad for everyone who are affected by this transaction."
"Rock solid always increasing divy, with price up 18% in two months.. what's not to like? It's a keeper.."
"Definite buy here while it's red, before earnings.HUGE pop off planned for us on Monday. I'm really here inside this thing. pretty confident."
Can only wish those who still own to get out of Dodge. Sinking faster than the Titanic.

I see no one is happy with ugi . - so glad I cashed out before the merger. Someone is now making a very healthy income ~ and it’s not the investors. So sad every time I see Amerigas cylinders at Home Depot. Was such a great deal for investors and employees with stock shares. Greed won. Glta
"UGI surely heading to >L, div just hiked for the 34th straight year, div payday July 1. There isn't a more rock solid dividend in the stock universe. it's a keeper..."
UGI is up 4.93% to 38.34
"For all you investors who had AmeriGas and now UGI. Remember way back when AmeriGas was hit with a class action suit in W. Virginia? It was about the depth of underground gas lines. I believe the suit cost them $20-25 million. Not small change. Well, it might be happening again. I have brought this issue to there attention in NY and their arrogant attitude by refusing to address, forces me to reach out. Any class lawyers out there?"
"lol.. looks like this is the Joe board, so I'll say yowza, UGI up again.. steady heading to L.. div hiked again this Q.."

"Well, the deal is done. Hope they can make it works out & continue boosting the divy."
"UGI is the parent company of Amerigas, turns out Amerigas has dropped non national accounts for service. Terrible communication, left all the small independent stores out in the cold and hasn’t communicated that this has happened. That should be sued. I’m sure UGI doesn’t even know."
picked up a couple @3% fwd yield today...
