"Director Dosch just bought 10,000 shares of UGI. Here's the filing that just came out:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/884614/000120919121008821/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"
"Been a shareholder for a month due to the method or their prorated conversation. Asked for all cash, got 32% in cash and UGI shares. Sell order has been riding at the cash conversion price which may ar may not be reached (it is lower than the UGI 52 week high). UGI paid their increased dividend today $.32/share, but only to Shareholders of record August 8. No converted UGI shareholders receive this. This whole buyout smells bad with APU and UGI managements reaping the rewards.The vote was a given due to UGI corporate and both managements control. Any info on class action suits?"
"Definite buy here while it's red, before earnings.HUGE pop off planned for us on Monday. I'm really here inside this thing. pretty confident."
"I was going to sell after the merger, but decided to hold. I like the idea of no cut in dividend during 2008-2009 time period. Also, I think NG and Propane will rise in the future."
"UGI 2 million equity offering is called Dilution sellout to preferred holders, plus they get 10% Interest and we get nothing. Going to $33."
Joestradamus predicts: new 52 wk high before ex-div...
"According to the slide presentation, they forecast $4.05 for 2023. There is a lot of integration savings and cost given the acquisitions. For 2019. Some good news, EBITDA was only down 4.2% even though EPS showed poor Y/Y comparisons. Nowadays cutting a forecast results in computers just dumping. I have owed this stock for a long time. They are aggresively transforming the company which is a good thing. That means they are paying attention. If they earn $4.05 in 2023 and it sells for 16x in 2022, our compound return will be 19%. I am willing to hang in and add for that kind of risk/reward."
"UGI up seven straight trading days, div just hiked for the 34th year straight, divs paid continuously since 1884(no typo). Not too shabby cookin with gas! %^)"
picked up a couple @3% fwd yield today...
"Done, out of UGI completely. Good luck to those old Amerigas friends who remain. Hoping Shell continues to rise and pay it's dividend. Have a Happy and Healthy New Year to all!"
"yowza, UGI is bangin back today.. I've been buying it on the drop, because it is a div rock like few others...div paid since 1885!, increased for 34 years straight, at a 5yr.DGR of 7.7%.. the payout ratio only 50%, low for any utility. They've got LNG locked up in the USA and Int'l., #1 brand here and Europe. Plus midstream NG, electric and HVAC for more diversification. Divs are a paycheck for me in early retirement... I need it constant, reliable and increasing. UGI fits the bill baby..."
I see no one is happy with ugi . - so glad I cashed out before the merger. Someone is now making a very healthy income ~ and itâ€™s not the investors. So sad every time I see Amerigas cylinders at Home Depot. Was such a great deal for investors and employees with stock shares. Greed won. Glta
When is UGI going to finalize APU stock holders? Are they waiting to make money on interest to help them pay? SEC should have a rule to make these deals done within 24 to 48 hours!
"UGI surely heading to >L, div just hiked for the 34th straight year, div payday July 1. There isn't a more rock solid dividend in the stock universe. it's a keeper..."
"Using cash plus stock to buy Amerigas! Hmmm, don't see where they would announce a split but they likely will dilute current holders to pay APU holders. See them add to the float!"
"this company has been around since 1883, first dividend payment in 1886, i own over 2k shares, i am really unhappy with what is happening to this company, the managment even moved the annual meeting ans time to make it harder for shareholders to come. i guess they didnt want to hear gripes, one good thing, many of the options that the CEO's pay is tied to are worthless. i hope john feels the pain."
"AmeriGas will do well this Fall, Winter, Spring as outdoor dining only for restaurants will need to provide portable heat at outside tables. Buy some UGI stock, and get an extra cannister or two for yourself before there is a shortage."
"You guys are all correct. I believe most of the unit holders of APU got a bad deal. Not only did we loose a good source of dividend income, we were taken for a unwanted ride. I knew the all share deal would be a bad deal so I opted for all cash at the cash rate of 35 and some cents, but only about 32% of my units were cashed, rest was went through share conversion. Now I have no idea of how long we got to wait for UGI to go up. Who ever is not interested in holding the shares will keep selling and that will put pressure on the share price. I feel really bad for everyone who are affected by this transaction."
You would think the early cold weather would affect the stock price. Not here.
"yowza, UGI is returning to FV, it's still way below.. Dividend king of kings, paid a div for 136 years straight!, and increased it for 34 years without fail. 5yr average DGR is 7%.. works for me %^ )"
