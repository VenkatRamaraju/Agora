Shorts are in big trouble today & over the next few days
"One final piece of homework news- Chinese stocks perform best between September-December!! Yes it’s well documented and you would know that already if you did your homework instead of listening to perma bears and talking media heads run there FEAR mouths!! Man, I sure wouldn’t want to be holding a short position or long puts especially on margin!! Good luck with that no thanks!! Go Baidu!! "
"BIDU has been losing its search engine ground to byte-dance, and that is why the stock is in such discount. But the company knows this and is trying ti switch to AI an cloud business. Its cutting edge Apollo AI smart driving system is in testing and may soon be released to electrical car manufactures. if it succeed in this direction the stock could be multifold but all depends. BIDU is also now the largest private cloud space provider in china."
"Another great day for Baidu!! Most of the stocks gave back their big gains from earlier this week, but Baidu held!!! Why? Because it’s insanely discounted!!!! Stock should be easily 1000/share"
moved all my assets from BABA to BIDU and JD and so far so good!JACK MA will be arrested soon!
What a strong trading day. Digested the gains from yesterday and then slowly went back to unchanged at the end of the day. I only wish I had added this morning.
A lot of money moving over from Baba!! Bidu is the jewel of China stocks
Baidu up in HK again!! Let’s go
Going to 165 then 175
"We're in an environment where every regulatory headline out of china affects all of its stocks. If you look at the recent headlines, they don't affect the earnings potential of the company and so if you believe they will have good earnings the fear should be ignored."
Baidu just raised debt in USA market. Investor interest and confidence is there. Also focused on “hard tech” ev ai and semis design which ccp wants vs platform economies like WeChat tencent where all the regulation (although minor and common sense) is focused
Beautiful intraday chart after buying on the dip. Closing at the high of the day???
One year target $1667.00. Wow ..
"Buy now, dont regret later when the train has left."
We all know that if baidu were an American company it would have a trillion dollar MCAP!!! The company has incredible innovative products hitting the market!!! I’m here for the long haul!!
FYI. There is a $5bn share repurchase program in place. https://ir.baidu.com/news-releases/news-release-details/baidu-upsizes-share-repurchase-program-us45-billion
"Bought more BaiduI bought another 180 shares of Baidu at $152 per share. This brings my total up to 300 shares at an average cost of $174 per share. This is a long-term investment into their AI future. For more info on why I’m bullish on Baidu see the Introduction header to the Silicon Investor Baidu message board, linked below.https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=55838Cheers,Frank"
Bidu the jewel of the stock market!!! Such an incredible company!!!
I heard about BIDU the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"It's such a tiny fraction of Baidu does, but the fact it's Smart Speaker business Xiaodu is valued now at 5.1 Billion in it's Series B financing and the fact it is even more popular and more sold than Google's smart speakers just shows how insanely cheap Baidu stock is... When you add up the sum of it's parts (Search, Ads, Cloud, AI chips, AI services, Autonomous taxis, Autonomous buses, Autonomous cars, OS for cars, streaming services, streaming short videos, etc) I just don't see a way this doesn't become a trillion dollar company within 5 years even with the all of the China govt headwinds..."
Any good news of china cooperating w the us and it sends this soaring imho
Bidu is up 7.58 % in Hong Kong144.800 +10.200 (+7.58%)As of August 24 11:59AM HKT. Market open.
Bought another 5000 shares today. Great company!!
"This was somewhat expected. The way hedge fund and big bank crooks operate is they create bubbles and burst them when it is convenient for them. if you remember the huge upward movement in Chinese stocks earlier this year, that was a just setup to lure investors into buying Chinese stocks. Of course hedge funds sold at the top, then start spreading fears about Chinese stocks by blowing every news out of china out of proportions. It seems though major media outlets, hedge funds are all connected and acting in tandem. News always seem to support whatever the hedge funds are doing at the time."
Baidu is the Best company in the world!!! It’s a combination of Google/Tesla/Apple all in 1!!! Trading at 25x less than where it should be!!! $3000+/share
Jeez I put over 50k in calls this morning on Bidu and baba Let’s go!
Baidu announces new chip and RoboCar!!!! Wow!!! In a normal market this stock would be up 20-30 on the news.
"Bloomberg continues to pound the China story, they have no other news to report on."
"NVDA hit 550 billion today, and BIDU likely has a better AI chip than NVDA and it's only a very small part of it's products... BIDU will be a multi trillion dollar company eventually. Ignore all the noise and just collect shares."
Broke down and bought 100 shares today. Best deal out there.
"This whole ""China (CCP) cracking down on Chinese stocks"" narrative started with DIDI, rushing its IPO without fulfilling all the user data requirements imposed the Chinese government, similar to the rules in the US. Considering US Hedge funds made billions from the resulting sell-off, could the whole thing with DIDI IPO have been planned to justify the sell off so Hedge funds can make billions from short selling?"
I think it’s a fair statement when I say that Baidu is the cheapest stock of a profitable company in the entire world..
weather people like it or not china is the future of technology and the power house of money
"Sick thing about baidu, if this were an American stock is would be valued somewhere between Tesla and Google!! So I would say 1.5trillion valuation which is 30x higher than where it’s currently trading giving it a 4290/share price"
This long term is your best Chinese investment. The government has clamped down before but if they want to be the worlds greatest power they can't destroy the best in the class technology.
"Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon (MAGA) is nearing a 10 Trillion market cap now (2.5 trillion market cap average per company)... Baidu is only valued at 50 billion and it is 1 of only 4 major tech companies in the 2nd largest market in the world that makes up BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiomi). This is a ludicrously low valuation, and BIDU will be valued well over a trillion within 5 years. It remains the best value on the planet. until it's 1000/share or higher it still will be the best deal on the planet."
Baidu is the #1 stock to own in china!!! A lot of money coming in from baba investors
$BABA $HUYA $BIDU Cathie Wood betray us! Those trust her since 2021 probably down over 50%..
"Just some quick fun comparisons:BIDU vs NVDAMarket cap: 50B vs 550B. Baidu 1100% cheaperRevenue: 20B (2x) vs 20B (25x) (Baidu 1500% cheaper)Profits. 7.5B (PE 7) vs 9B (PE 70). (Baidu 1000% cheaper)Book Value: 1.4 vs 25 (Baidu 1800% cheaper)..Growth rate: 20 to 30% for bothSo, there you go. The current China discount is somewhere between 1000 to 2000%.. I love the odds China tech will outperform American tech in the next 10 years."
"Don’t care what articles are out now, this is done on purpose, bidu can’t be brought down from here, seller at 200"
