"Mass liquidation of Chinese stocks has resumed. China will go through a decade of stagflation. Deteriorating fundamentals from here. If I have access, I would short Chinese real estate with increasing size."
3-4% Gap up tomorrow. See you then.
it held up all day were it opened .market dropped 450.. lets see what happens over night
I just bought 10 more and parked it for 10 yrs long.
"Bloomberg continues to pound the China story, they have no other news to report on."
It’s incredible how Facebook and Google continue to hit new highs as US regulators are cracking down on data useage!!!! But China does it and their stocks drop 60%!!! What a scam!!!
strong buy
A lot of money moving over from Baba!! Bidu is the jewel of China stocks
Wallstreet crooks bought Call and Put options with higher portion of put options as well as common shares. What they are doing is they are selling the common shares to decrease the value and increasing put option values significantly. The net gain on these transactions are significant. Pure manipulation. Let these manipulators do this until they run out of gas.
My call bought last week is up 25% guys! I may make $20K on this if BIDU hit $150!BIDU Nov 19 2021 140 Call
Baidu set a share offering ... making 1 Billion USD for the company ... does anyone know the average share price ?
What a great day this was why u ask??? We just shook off alot of paper hands and we still moving up 
"Trading at a current PE ratio of 7.5!!!! Lmaooo best value in the stock market if rn!! Don’t believe the China noise, this is just wallstreet coming up with another way to get u to sell ur shares cheap to them."
weather people like it or not china is the future of technology and the power house of money
guess who is shorting these stocks ... hedge funds where is the MEME team when we need them.
"I am adding on every 5% drop toBABABIDUTCEHYJDMOMOHUYABILIPPDDIDIChina, as much as I hate CCP, is the second greatest economy. USA will NEVER be independent of Chinese products. Question: Can Apple or Amazon or Walmart survive without China?"
"For anyone long, short, sideways? on BIDU I encourage you to watch a recent interview Li did with Bloomberg last quarter.17:30: Innovation and tech is at center of Chinese innovation 18:15: Li supports anti-trust focus of govt19:30: Li supports open source platforms and discusses BIDUs open source approachDespite all of the negative press and news about Chinese stocks Li is saying and most importantly doing the right things- investing in technologies and capabilities which will fuel the next wave of economic growth in China- AI, autonomous, chips. His interview highlights his rational and practical approach to the situation which is exactly what you want in an exec. Xi is cleaning house and so far, BIDU has been relatively unscathed apart of the delisting concerns. No major fines or impact to BIDUs business. In fact I believe that China and Xi are actually doubling down on companies like BIDU that are truly game changing and have huge implications for the Chinese market and economy.I believe we will eventually look back at today's valuations of BIDU as opportunities to enter or average down. This company has so much going for it whether they get delisted or not. Long BIDUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g332_cRrr_M"
"BIDU has been losing its search engine ground to byte-dance, and that is why the stock is in such discount. But the company knows this and is trying ti switch to AI an cloud business. Its cutting edge Apollo AI smart driving system is in testing and may soon be released to electrical car manufactures. if it succeed in this direction the stock could be multifold but all depends. BIDU is also now the largest private cloud space provider in china."
I pray I can break even within a couple of years.
"More than a year back, it was well below $100. Anyone still remember? But it still. Managed to pick up as high as $350. Now history is repeating itself. I believe near $100 is a good buy after all. Stop with all the BS and rumors about delisting Chinese companies. This will NEVER HAPPEN. CHINA MARKET IS TOO BIG TO IGNORE. Institutions and big investors will come begging their way when big tech Chinese companies are back to the right price again. This is simply transitory!!!"
"Just some quick fun comparisons:BIDU vs NVDAMarket cap: 50B vs 550B. Baidu 1100% cheaperRevenue: 20B (2x) vs 20B (25x) (Baidu 1500% cheaper)Profits. 7.5B (PE 7) vs 9B (PE 70). (Baidu 1000% cheaper)Book Value: 1.4 vs 25 (Baidu 1800% cheaper)..Growth rate: 20 to 30% for bothSo, there you go. The current China discount is somewhere between 1000 to 2000%.. I love the odds China tech will outperform American tech in the next 10 years."
At a $57B market cap this is either going to sit here or rocket tomorrow. HOW in the world can it get cheaper? Margins are getting BETTER. AI investments are coming to fruition! We dropped 25% in the last 2 months on nothing related to Baidu itself!
Note that ark has not been selling bidu.
"You see here a crisis, I see an opportunity"
"going to be a big bullish from now until the end of August, 160$ easy target. write my words."
"Going to break $150, and then 140. Nothing changed at all !!"
Does anyone know the time of day BIDU will report earnings?
"This is all I have to say - when covid became the narrative the sky was falling and the market dropped 30-40%, then it recovered to crazy heights. Same story here with China, sky is falling and then one day it’s not and bammm!!!!! All China stocks are popping…save this post"
I am also long 225 $152.50 weekly calls wish me luck need to recoup some losses
Any hint of easing of restrictions from China and this flys along with babba imo
Unless we get a market correction I see $155 as a bottom based on improving fundamentals as several have pointed out. $145 would be major support where previous resistance would become support in a market pullback.
We all know that if baidu were an American company it would have a trillion dollar MCAP!!! The company has incredible innovative products hitting the market!!! I’m here for the long haul!!
Ok so from $350 to $145 in 6 months. Who says WS isn’t a casino?
This looks like a gorgeous BUY!
Any good news of china cooperating w the us and it sends this soaring imho
Some updates on $doyu https://youtu.be/drbWqlidK3E$huya $bidu $baba $iq
BlackRock calls for investors to lift allocations to China’s markets...BlackRock’s research unit has said China should no longer be considered an emerging market and recommended investors boost their exposure to the country by as much as three times.
"Well I think bottom is here! Cramer jumped on board in his usual fashion. Sell sell sell after a 50 percent drop, buy buy buy after 50 percent gain! I watched him do that with Apple for years. Sell sell sell at bottom buy buy buy at top. Thanks Cramer keep them”great analysis coming!"
Will it close green?...
Baidu is the Best company in the world!!! It’s a combination of Google/Tesla/Apple all in 1!!! Trading at 25x less than where it should be!!! $3000+/share
"EPS of $19.49 - at a 15 multiple the stock should be trading at $292. At a GOOG multiple of 30, BIDU would trade at $584. I could be wrong, but I think the China regulatory malaise with pass and fundamentals will drive this stock again."
"We're in an environment where every regulatory headline out of china affects all of its stocks. If you look at the recent headlines, they don't affect the earnings potential of the company and so if you believe they will have good earnings the fear should be ignored."
Good posts today John!! Glad to see a few bulls left holding court!!! Lol . The markets trying to chase away all the bulls while it successfully rounds up all the bears to be slaughtered. I Definitely agree with your post today!!! Go Baidu!!! 
"Lol The P/B of BIDU is at 0.20. TSLA is at 28. At P/B of 28, BIDU should be priced at $21,385 per share. Lol. Is this some kind of joke?"
"You all need to stop looking at BIDU and other 'quality' Chinese equities through a microscope!! So much complaining and what is really happening is that you are missing an opportunity!! When things are going horribly and the share price is getting crushed (in quality companies)....is that a buying opportunity or a good time to get out?? Were you someone who was selling last spring? If so, you don't get it. Always rebalance your portfolio to what you are comfortable with while keeping a position in cash for 'opportunity'. If you are getting to much opportunity with your stock positions you should consider your buying practices. Do you run out and buy b/c you heard something on CNBC or from a friend? If so....you need to rethink your those practices.Just to give you a look at BIDU from the fundamental point of view....and it will trade on fundamentals at some point;Total Cash - 25BCash/sh- $74.45Total Debt- 12.8BTotal Debt/Equity 5.3Book Value- $105.40/shThis is what you own and if your whining about it at 160s/sh then I don't know how to help you."
"Remember- Wall Streets main objective is to take as much money from you and fool you most of the time. Sounds like a casino right!! Do your homework and make good rational choices and sit tight. Baidu’s going higher there’s know doubt about it, but don’t expect the games to stop or get any easier. They will fool you and temp you to make the same mistakes over and over. Look at how many have sold and became bears overnight and now are sitting there saying now what the hell do I do!! Don’t try and time the market and don’t jump in and out. Your either a Baidu investor or your not-don’t lose your money and cry later!! Go Baidu!! "
Up huge in HK!!!!!!!!!!
China news so overblown!!! US Congress has been making fb google ceos testify about how they gather data!! Same stuff is going on in the US but media not blowing it out of proportion!! regulations are good!!
$141long loving it waiting on any dip to buy more best time to be alive baby
"Herman Yu (CFO but now going to be Chief Strategy Officer) is obviously being groomed to take over as CEO by Robin Li. Yu seems more than capable to take Baidu to the trillion market cap... Very sharp, and I can tell from the conference calls he is going to be great on the execution of AI, autonomous driving, cloud etc. while still maximizing profits on both the Core and Non-core sides of business..."
"China reporting on $BIDU had only positive things, even reporting that Covid was a boon for their business. Improving business and social value.US reporting on Baidu would make you think the company was going to die. What is going on?$BABA $JD $TCEHY"
Just seems to me that this media manipulation has gotten out of hand!! Print some articles when they have loaded up on puts to drive down the stock price. Sick how oversold this stock is rn.
Thank Jack Ma for this mess.
Do Google and apple drop when The US says that college will be free ? Does TSLA tumble when Uber end Airbnb get regulated. Yet BIDU plummets on every negative story out if China.
The hammer from Supreme Commander Xi will resume its descend today
I'm still sitting at loss lol ...   
How many here have an Avg price of 220 or more? Thoughts on future pricing? Shorts can stay 
Najarian on half time report is buying calls on the Chinese stock ETF. He said people are pouring into those calls now. Maybe the selling is over and we head higher now.
"Encouraging news from Baidu this evening. They are raising money via debt. First, they are growing and management is willing to invest in R&D and new business opportunities. Second, they are using Goldman, among others. Like or hate Goldman, but they are the preeminent investment banking firm. Third, they are issuing debt not equity. If management thought their shares were over priced or due for a significant drop because of US or Chinese regulatory bodies, they would issue equity and tons of it."
"China is going to work with USA on the audit Policies !!! Chinese stocks will soar Today Bidu , Nio ,Xpev !! Let's Go !"
"Cathy Wood (ARC) sold 3M shares of bidu recently, at a loss, so while i am long, but i think i am on the wrong side of the market. This stock has done nothing for months , i feel more pain to come. I hope i am wrong, Charts are indecisive."
"this board wants to ignore for example what the sec said today. "" That chinese stock delistings is a clicking clock. Just a matter of time. I love the company but I dont love the stock. So, you want to be th musical chair when this things gets delisted and that is a distinct possibility. I made a comment and no one responded. Did anyone pay attention to the dilution from 8 shares to 1 to 10 shares to 1. That is adr's. They just diluted you and you say nothing here. Wake up"
"This may be as undervalued as other Chinese stocks, but because of the only 57B marketcap, is can easily double easier than a Baba or Tencent"
From July 2011 to today the share price did nothing .. 10 years of absolutely nothing omg
what a nightmare. When will this horror end?
All Chinese Stocks are in bear   territory. 11 negative trading days. bidu and baba can go up 10 to 20% easily on any trade easement or positive news.
"Honk Kong is liking what there seeing!! Big AI event, hello people that’s Baidu’s future growth and where Robin Li and Herman Yu is taking your company!! The rest is just FUD!!!! Go Baidu go!!! "
"Shares of Baidu Inc. $BIDU slipped 0.8% in premarket trading Thursday, after the China-based internet search engine reported second-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations, driven by strength in the artificial intelligence business, but provided revenue growth outlooks in which the midpoint of guidance was below forecasts.I’m only 4 months into trading, once I started with https://stockhaul.today/August-Test-Drive and actually listening to the regulars on here , my performance almost doubled! It also lets you search to find unique stocks with relative strength outperforming the markets."
"hey someone! Baidu why not buy back its shares at this price? they have a lot of money, they can do it, and they would also reduce sales pressure. It would be a rational move, why not?"
To the moon 
Nothing fundamentally wrong with BIDU. Just market noise! Be greedy when others are fearful. With due diligence of course. That's how big fortunes are made in the stock market
Baidu just raised debt in USA market. Investor interest and confidence is there. Also focused on “hard tech” ev ai and semis design which ccp wants vs platform economies like WeChat tencent where all the regulation (although minor and common sense) is focused
One thing that really stinks is the fact that baidu world day was last week!!! Imagine the pop we would have gotten if it were today :((
Wake up children. It’s going to a ten P/E and that will put the stock price around $74
BIG BUYERS MOVING IN.... wow big moves
"no comments on the dilution of ads shares from from 8 to 1 to 10 to 1, real dilution. Can someone respond please on this board."
Buy when there is blood in the street. This stock has been cut in half. Way overdone.
"Most of the options being bought are puts, so i am of the view we will see a big down side come option expiration. most of the long like Cathy are losing money, all adrs are being punished, I doubt if BIDU can escape this onslaught. Having said all that Charts are beginning to show upside trend, need the trend to continue for a day or two for positive confirmation."
Pe under 7 lolll this is stock market comedy hour
"Beginner investor question: does the current P/E ratio of Baidu present a distorted picture, because of the spike in earnings of the last quarter? Since the earnings of the quarters before last earnings were a lot lower, the P/E ratio would’ve been higher at that time. Is that correct?"
There isn't a point selling at these levels. Recovery will happen eventually !#BuyAndHold !#HODL$BIDU $BABA $XNET $DOYU $HUYA $NIO $XPENG $TCEHY $TME $IQ $BB $ZEPP $MOMO $YALLA $PDD $TAL
BIDU has $46 billion in cash divided by the market cap of 146 billion = 30% cash￼. $20 per year earnings. Worth $350 per share
This long term is your best Chinese investment. The government has clamped down before but if they want to be the worlds greatest power they can't destroy the best in the class technology.
"Don’t care what articles are out now, this is done on purpose, bidu can’t be brought down from here, seller at 200"
"Buying great businesses like $BABA $BIDU on the cheap is what this game is about, I hope the prices drop so we can buy more. Volatility is our friend, she brings us low prices for solid businesses. 2-3 years from now we will be thanking her for the dips she generously gives us!"
"IMAGES.Baidu: Implied upside of 141%In spite of a recent crackdown by the Chinese government on a host of tech stocks, Wall Street remains largely undeterred that China-based internet search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) will head higher. In fact, based on the high-water analyst price target of nearly $395, Baidu could offer gains of as much as 141%."
One year target $1667.00. Wow ..
"RSI of 26.3, one of the lowest I have seen in my life. Incredible!"
"Revenue beat + earnings beat = stock drop  blame it on guidance, which happens to be projected at 25% yoy growth "
"According to @business, China’s securities regulator convened a virtual meeting with executives of major investment banks on Wednesday night, attempting to ease market fears about #Beijing’s crackdown on the private education industry.#China #stocks https://t.co/aHwTvXpYGe$BABA $BIDU $HUYA $XNET $MOMO $IQ $DOYU $NIO $XPENG $LI $BILI $ FUTU"
That was a strong day and very bullish close!!! This should continue towards 170 shorty
I expect a huge bounce soon$WIMI $NIO $BIDU
"This whole ""China (CCP) cracking down on Chinese stocks"" narrative started with DIDI, rushing its IPO without fulfilling all the user data requirements imposed the Chinese government, similar to the rules in the US. Considering US Hedge funds made billions from the resulting sell-off, could the whole thing with DIDI IPO have been planned to justify the sell off so Hedge funds can make billions from short selling?"
1 trillion dollar company trading at a 50billion MCAP!!! Sickest thing I’ve ever seen
It is too late to sell
"SERIOUSLY?!! down 4% on an already beat down depressed stock... top & bottom line beat. Solid guidance growth. Analysts blame possible COVID resurgence as a concern..... really? $55B market cap, $10B net cash, this is way beyond punished."
Xi understands capitalism better than the SEC. he knows wallstreet isn’t about to foregoAll the money to be made on China IPOs. Xi is just brilliantly calling their bluff so he can negotiate the next terms with the upcoming agreements on China ADR stocks. He figured he would let his CCP allies make some money shorting while he played.
Just bought some more for the long-term account.
"An unique opportunity for me, strong buy.The same baba and tencent"
Even Cathie wood lose big money in bidu.. She load up Bidu from Dec 10 to Feb 26 ($160 to $280) She sold it all in May around $180 range..
"Starting look like the most dangerous short in the market, this can go up in hurry"
Bought it at $137 having a awesome feeling
"Out of all the Chinese stocks, Bidu to me is the most attractive one. Took a flier on this one yesterday and added more on the dip at 140!! Good luck"
"Ok now Im feeling like I am getting scammed. I just read that Baidu changed there capital structure with instead of onw share of Baidu being 10 shares of the ADS, its is now only 8 shares. This effectively is diluting us and foreign investors. Can someone please explain why the board is not more in an uproar over this. I loved Baidu the company and feel that it could be a 10 bagger from here without outside interference and the risks of being delisted. I don't know what to do so I liquidated after making double my money on this stock. I want to come back in but I am not sure if this is investable.Can someone help explain to me if Baidu can keep diluting the ads shares and is it worth going back in the stock? Thanks in advance"
"$BABA $BIDU:If you are curious, check out Laurion Capital Management and what they are holding and doing. They have bought Alibaba put options worth of $931 M, Alibaba common shares of $688M and Alibaba call options of $377M. So obvious they are dumping common shares while making multiplied profits from its put holdings. Manipulation at max."
FCF/Sale >5% is a great stock.Revenue $4.9BFCF $1.1BFCF/Sale 22.4%You be the judge.
"Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU and HKEX:9888) on Thursday announced the launch of Apolong II, a new generation of multi-purpose autonomous minibuses that are being rolled out in Guangzhou Huangpu District"
Trading at a 2000% discount right now!!!! Just buy as much as u can
"Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon (MAGA) is nearing a 10 Trillion market cap now (2.5 trillion market cap average per company)... Baidu is only valued at 50 billion and it is 1 of only 4 major tech companies in the 2nd largest market in the world that makes up BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiomi). This is a ludicrously low valuation, and BIDU will be valued well over a trillion within 5 years. It remains the best value on the planet. until it's 1000/share or higher it still will be the best deal on the planet."
"HK it was up, it will pop up in US shortly!"
"It’s never shocking to hear all the negative news about China stocks now at 52 week lows, they love them at highs hate them at lows, you have admire Wall Street"
Rsi of 14 on hourly. So so oversold
"Don’t be shocked if it closes higher from the open, nothing wrong with earnings, buy the open"
BIDU back at 2020 pre-covid prices think about what has changed other than PE=7 lol
"Sold that one @300 but now I’m back in. Following the earnings, I feel that true value is much higher than the current price."
In the paper this stocks is way way under value but that’s not the point the point is this Chinese stocks super risky and as you can see tons of investors got burned
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Pick-stocks.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Shorts are in big trouble today & over the next few days
Just sold my positions with 10% loss. I believe in Bidu but nobody knows how this stock will fall again. I will buy back later
Jeez I put over 50k in calls this morning on Bidu and baba Let’s go!
"Man Baidu is running hard in honk Kong!! Honk Kongs Market didn’t stay in bear territory long did it!!! Wall Street lead all these bears into the slaughter house-suckers fell for it again!!! SMH They deserve it for not doing there homework. But let’s thank them-, because if it weren’t for the perma bear/FUD spreaders we would not have had a chance to buy our stock so dam cheap. So thank you Bears!! Yes they will say it’s only a short term bounce, but us real investors know what Baidu’s worth and it’s not just numbers bouncing around a screen all day!! Stay long and go Baidu!! "
This stock will be up 25-30 points in no time just stay long
What a strong trading day. Digested the gains from yesterday and then slowly went back to unchanged at the end of the day. I only wish I had added this morning.
"NVDA hit 550 billion today, and BIDU likely has a better AI chip than NVDA and it's only a very small part of it's products... BIDU will be a multi trillion dollar company eventually. Ignore all the noise and just collect shares."
All Chinese stocks is a great buy at these prices WE ALL WILL 2x by next year guarantee ps Kweb is the Chinese etf ￼
"I now own only 1 Chinese stock……Baidu. This is despite all the regulatory risks, China bashing, and the whole kitchen sink of negatives! Baidu has $45/share of cash after paying off debt; this means at current price of $162, you are paying $117 for nearly $10 of current year’s earnings. This translates to PE of 12x current year earnings, with zero value given to Apollo AV unit and zero value given to IQ holdings of Baidu which is generating negative loss. In fact, excluding non-core businesses the multiple becomes even cheaper…..meaning forget getting any value for them, they are penalizing the value of Core business itself. My bet is that when all the dust settles and when all the Chinese stocks get thrown out, if there is just one stock whose value would be much higher in 2023 I would place the bet on Baidu. In the event I am wrong, and it keeps on getting even cheaper I will consider adding to it after 3-4 months."
Cloud growth 71%. Cash equivalents. Nearly $28B .. no brainer!!!
Bought mine at $137 I love the comments thanks all ; )
Man Bidu is doing well against all other major Chinese stocks!
"I am very optimistic about the GDPR. Once it's passed, BABA BIDU DIDI TCEHY JD PDD BILI HUYA ,.... will fly. China is interested in foreign funds and investment.Chinese stocks are 500% more attractive in valuation and 150% riskier.Make the comparison and get the math right."
will close today at 158$
"Tomorrow should be interesting.. Really the only number that matters is the Guidance on the Revenue Growth. If it's 20%+ the stock will skyrocket. If it's 10% or less the stock will go sideways a little longer. Either way, Baidu is at least 200% too cheap."
"$BABA, $BIDU saw their shares turn around from early losses today and head north in the wake of Beijing passing a sweeping new data-privacy law. Early Friday, China's state media outlet Xinhua said the new regulations are aimed at ""prohibiting the excessive collection of personal information and big data-enabled price discrimination against existing customers,"" and will go into effect on Nov. 1. This free service can be helpful if want to find the best opportunities to trade and assemble your watch list ahead of the opening bell https://tradepicker.today/tt37tb"
So Bidu been trading on the us market since 2005!!! Not worried about the noise!!! Loading up!!!
"Investors have little trust for communism or socialism. The peoples democratic socialist republic of China needs to rebuild trust. I think it will go up, but not like it once did. Will always trade undervalued. Slightly bullish to $200 over next 6 months assuming the Chinese Government backs off."
Lol… at what point is enough?
"Ok, this has been funny. I started buying yesterday and continued today. The earnings are off the chart and they have plenty of cash per share. This is going back to $200 soon."
Bidu exploding higher in Hong Kong!!!!!!
Baidu not part of China crackdown!!! They are doing a bond sale right now!!!! Would have gotten ccp denial if they couldn’t operate under normal conditions!!!! Full speed ahead!!! Permission to come about captain!!!!
going up from here 160 to 165 to day
RoboCar Ev!!!!!!! How da fk is this trading at a MCAP of 50billion and NIO is 59Billion MCAP?????? sickest thing I’ve ever seen. Baidu is the Google Tesla apple of China all rolled in 1!!!! Buy as much as u can!!!!
"Lots of short sellers last week. Price action doesn't make sense at all, so we'll see the rebound eventually.Either from this level, or when KWEB hits 40s"
"It's such a tiny fraction of Baidu does, but the fact it's Smart Speaker business Xiaodu is valued now at 5.1 Billion in it's Series B financing and the fact it is even more popular and more sold than Google's smart speakers just shows how insanely cheap Baidu stock is... When you add up the sum of it's parts (Search, Ads, Cloud, AI chips, AI services, Autonomous taxis, Autonomous buses, Autonomous cars, OS for cars, streaming services, streaming short videos, etc) I just don't see a way this doesn't become a trillion dollar company within 5 years even with the all of the China govt headwinds..."
Bullish close at the top of the range near $142.50Short term bottomBack to $146-150 tomorrow!
I heard about BIDU the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Sick thing about baidu, if this were an American stock is would be valued somewhere between Tesla and Google!! So I would say 1.5trillion valuation which is 30x higher than where it’s currently trading giving it a 4290/share price"
"Bought another 1,000 shares around $148.5"
"KeyBanc Capital Markets, BofA Securities , CitiGroup and Oppenheimer All reiterated BUY today!"
This would be a classic time for those WSB guys to get involved in a stock like this!! Instead they waste their time with GameStop and AMC!! I am going to call on the Reddit squad!! See if they will come
$BIDU Target Lowered by Oppenheimer Holdings Outperform USD 355 » USD 320 Target Lowered by Benchmark Buy USD 370 » USD 357 Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 332 » USD 270
$BABA $HUYA $BIDU Cathie Wood betray us! Those trust her since 2021 probably down over 50%..
Seriously the most innovative company in the world right now with this AI RoboCar!! Tesla looks like it’s a Ford compared to this!!!
How does a company with 30% annual growth sit with a 17 PE amd decking for six months
Bidu closed strong!! That’s a good sign for the rest of the week!! I would not want to be short right now
This market is incredible irrational. I'm over here seeing companies that make no money and companies that are dinosaurs going up in value while a highly profitable company with a great balance sheet and first-class AI technology is constantly in the red. When will this madness end?!
"In general, the western will deny any growth of China (e.g. company growth - $BIDU). but, time will tell if China will influence global market with its power and become more stronger than U.S. in economy, and match military power with U.S."
Bidu was at $157 in Hong Kong mostly this morning. It should return to that by close today. Ergo. It’s a screaming buy to just pick up a couple of bucks.
$26B Cash on hand$1.1B Free cash flow$53B MC
revenues climbing ... stock price falling ... technically this is a bargain for us ... I adding some more!!!
"One final piece of homework news- Chinese stocks perform best between September-December!! Yes it’s well documented and you would know that already if you did your homework instead of listening to perma bears and talking media heads run there FEAR mouths!! Man, I sure wouldn’t want to be holding a short position or long puts especially on margin!! Good luck with that no thanks!! Go Baidu!! "
WOW Tuesdays futures don't look Good! How much further will this stock drop?

This is your company (If your an investor) and AI is the future watch Baidu’s event like everyone watches apples events here in the states. The Number one thing you should be is PASSIONATE PASSIONATE PASSIONATE about the company you own shares in-if not your just treating it like a one night stand!! Passion for your company is key (Always)- if you aren’t passionate about the company you own shares in then move on to another company!! Go Baidu, Go Apollo and Go AI!!! "
I am convinced $165 for baidu is the best bargain on the market right now
"Carl Just like the stock market was going to collapse because of covid….same story, keep pounding it!! I will keep adding. Nothing lasts forever, eventually just like covid, investors get numb to the issue and stocks recover"
Hang Seng getting destroyed down over 700 points. Bidu trading 134.6 hong kong which is roughly 138 here. So showing some strength.
"Nothing to do with the fundamentals, very sound. Its just that , well, it is a Chineese company, so punish them!"
Yes ! Now we can buy BIDU for what we paid 6 years ago - !! This is great - ! Right ?
"Let's relax just a bit, please. Whenever I invest in a stock, like Baidu, I first go over the fundamentals carefully... then, buy the stock... and, then FORGET about it for a few years. If you have a different time horizon, you will get cranky and VERY irritable. Some of the posts in this forum demonstrate that clearly. It's counterproductive to make yourself unhappy. So, why get excited and angry? Why worry about being taken advantage of... or being manipulated by... whatever. Over time, all types of fluctuations will even out. The basic reassurance of a long-term investor is that nearly all quality stocks will GROW in value. The problem for day/week traders? They think that they can time the market. Fact check: That's NOT possible. Even the best paid analysts get it wrong. But, if you are patient, you usually win. Baidu, in my opinion, is solid. It has a very nice and steady growth rate. It's future, I believe, is solid, too. CCP is just cleaning house right now just like we did here with Big Tech like Google, FB last year. Ignore the temporary dips. Sleep better by going LONG."
I’ve watched apple investor day and baidu just put apple to shame!!! The highlight of apples day in the spring of 2021 - we are offering a new cool Purple color to the iPhone!!!!! Ahahhahahahhahahaha
How much have you lost this week on Baidu?
Bidu.. needs urgently to buyback or give a special dividend to stop this irrational selling.. this company should value more than triple.. and more than five times if compare to google.. just the physicologycal factor is determined the actual situation..
Baidu is the #1 stock to own in china!!! A lot of money coming in from baba investors
"If baba is up, makes no sense why Bidu is down!! Pure manipulation!!! 7PE here!! Comical"
"Baidu World Congress will be held on August 18. The congress will fully display the latest achievements and applications of Baidu's artificial intelligence in the fields of travel, life, industry, independent innovation, and technology."
Is $BIDU P/E really 7.5!? That can’t be right!? If so massively massively undervalued even for a Chinese stock I will start a position soon!
"Watching the baidu event, it’s awesome "
"This is getting long in the tooth, needs to start heading higher the news coming out is pure bull"
Probably a 20% squeeze coming across all Chinese equities in the next month
Bidu is up 7.58 % in Hong Kong144.800 +10.200 (+7.58%)As of August 24 11:59AM HKT. Market open.
All the Chinese tech stocks should just delist and convert the ADRs to shares on Hong Kong exchange
Lotsa money moving in for long term holding.
If you’re a day trader you need to be using (http://trademarketview.tech). Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers and is extremely well researched. I don’t start trading without reading their email each morning!
Amazing beat and growth forecasts the only thing holding this down is that Chinese stocks are greatly out of favour right now. I expect this to change very soon and undervalued stocks like BIDU are going to reverse very quick just make sure you don’t miss the train
"Bought more BaiduI bought another 180 shares of Baidu at $152 per share. This brings my total up to 300 shares at an average cost of $174 per share. This is a long-term investment into their AI future. For more info on why I’m bullish on Baidu see the Introduction header to the Silicon Investor Baidu message board, linked below.https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=55838Cheers,Frank"
PB at 0.21 PER 1.91 as one of the largest companies in the world = HUMILIATION. The market is irrational and in panic. Time to load and accumulate.
9888.HK is up 5.75% to 154.60
Hanging tough
Alibaba should buy Bidu at that market cap
Won't have any growth. PE be 8-9. Fair value $82.
Weekly options chain is very low volume and open interest. Good to see that. Hoping for No manipulation or pinning.
"What I find comical is that Cramer is so late to the party, saying avoid China stocks after they dropped 30%+….. where was this recommendation 2 months ago? Now he makes a statement and pours fuel on the fire."
"If they have so much cash, why no dividend? I tell you, they will never pay you, they came to US market to get free money and never need to pay back."
Bidu mc should never be less then at least $150B. Buy Bidu Baba JD Didi and you will rich by mid next year.
Going to 165 then 175
27% YoY growth yet stock is flat. Maybe they’ll increase the buyback. Can’t wait for the call
"Enjoy the ride back up (yes there will be some bear head fakes along the way), but they left a lot of hints on the way down. We have 5 gaps to fill back to 200 and yes they will be filled. Go Baidu!! "
Remember everyone short must cover and buy back shares. Not sure what they’re waiting forAt $138 we are worth less than the assets of the company
"Ugggh!!! I hate that my hubs was right. He warned me not to buy any more China stocks even at 180 when I was convinced it wouldn’t go down further! Didn’t take his advice. Now I feel like I’m getting mocked everyday. Patiently waiting for the day this shoots back to 250 and I will do my happy dance  Stay strong, fellow longs! "
Especially future of baidu is in core tech ai+ autonomous vehicles. Geely(owns Volvo) + baidu few.
"Cramer said avoid China stocks, the bottom just got a lot closer folks"
"Nearly, nearly time to sell put and buy shares!"
"Guys just ride the downtrend! I cashed out on my $150 puts today, 70% up! Been shorting this since it was 186, and added 25% to my position today. Support should be around 125! So we have 15% more profits to make!!"
The only thing that has been accomplished this past week or two is the bulls ran for cover and the bears were lead in like sheep!! The bulls (weak hands) will miss the rally (because they sold and were scared out of a great company) and the bears will be left holding the bag (because they were over confident and got cocky)!! Go Baidu-The best is coming for those who do there homework and sit tight!! Lastly go read if you can’t watch Baidu’s AI event for goodness sake before you get all freaked out about Baidu’s future and growth!! There giving it to you in plain site-Go read. Still don’t get it move on!!!! 
This Chinese government capitulated!!! They realized they dont have nearly enough liquidity to support all these huge Chinese companies listed in the US! This is absolutely going to fly tomorrow! 20 bucks up by end of day.
"Normally I don't comment on stocks I don't own, but there is a ton of posters on BABA, JD, BIDU and all the way down the line screaming fundamentals. Look the fundamentals look great on paper, however there is two gigantic problems. The first issue is these results are not audited by any reputable firm. They can completely lie about numbers like so many other Chinese companies before. 2nd part is the Chinese government on what they are going to do. They could easily shut off all these American stock listings then what are you left with ? Whenever you have a government that can do pretty much whatever they want why invest in that company. It's so unpredictable with number that are not even properly audited. I recommend anyone watch the chinese hustle if you still don't understand .."

All The Key Announcements Made By Chinese Search Giant At ‘Baidu World 2021’ https://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=33466698
"NBC...China bans online gaming for 17 yr, old's and younger Monday thru Friday. I don't know how much of Bidu's revenue comes from gaming especially from teens,"
"The big lesson today was??????? Sit tight or you?ll be sitting on the sidelines watching the big gains pass you by!! Bears are cocky and overconfident thinking it was heading to 100 and below ????? SMH lol (below book value come on guys do your dam homework) yet so many listened to these clowns and have now had to watch from the sidelines Baidu return 15 percent in just 2 days!! The perma FUD bears will be quick to say it?s just a one day bounce it?s heading lower Blah Blah -nope sorry not with a 10 million share day that?s big money and conviction coming in buying up cheap shares (if the big money was concerned about the de-listing fears and China government BS and all this other propaganda fear that?s been spread there would be no day like today ever and definitely not over 10 million shares-use your brain ?????)!!! ?This will race to the 170?s quickly and leave all the bears crying and poor!! Unfortunately the weak handed bulls who were quick to jump ship can only watch now, because they don?t listen and sit tight knowing that Baidu?s best days are coming!! Nope instead there trying to time the market and make market predictions- sorry that?s a losers game and now you feel like #$%$ because you new better, but got scared away anyway by all the nonsense FUD!! Use this lesson as a learning experience!! Follow the fundamentals and be rational and use logic and don?t listen to the nonsense and maybe one day you?ll make the big money. Go Baidu!! ???????"
What bidu will do in 2022?
Regardless of the CCP bs this should still be at least $200
I feel the pain of long term investors..but with everything overpriced at the us market. And the panic all over Chinese stocks…if Baidu ain’t cooking the books this is a gift…Extreme opportunity
"BIDU is waaaaay oversold... so I bought some... not gonna bet the farm though. One of the greatest market truths ever: ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."""
Will run hard tomorrow pre earnings.
What did investors expect management to say about next earnings? They would be great? BIDU’s management has two audiences: investors and regulators. Regulators are more important at the moment. They had to provide a conservative forecast to try to keep the regulators off their back. Bottom line: investors have overreacted. Next quarter’s results will prove it.
"This was somewhat expected. The way hedge fund and big bank crooks operate is they create bubbles and burst them when it is convenient for them. if you remember the huge upward movement in Chinese stocks earlier this year, that was a just setup to lure investors into buying Chinese stocks. Of course hedge funds sold at the top, then start spreading fears about Chinese stocks by blowing every news out of china out of proportions. It seems though major media outlets, hedge funds are all connected and acting in tandem. News always seem to support whatever the hedge funds are doing at the time."
"There are thousands of profitable, well regulated, American companies where one can make good money by investing in. I don't need or want a Chinese hammer or car or computer or company stock. Communism and Capitalism are not totally compatible. Too much politics causes too downside which you may not see coming."
"Please keep selling, would love to buy more under a buck fifty. However one thing, when this black cloud that has persisted over China stocks goes away Bidu will jump like like a scolded dog. Way oversold based on fundamentals and growth potentials."
What does it mean that BIDU is now selling senior notes to raise money ? BIDU HK down to $139
$157 all day Thursday and today in Hong Kong equates to $150-$152 in USA. Insanity b
buy when other are fearful
Baidu up in HK again!! Let’s go
"Baidu robocar, semiconductors. This is the area ccp wants investors. Not platform economy WeChat"
Anyone know why Baidu is up 4% in Hong Kong tonight?
"Buy this open as well I am calling a short ten bottom, I’m buying so make fun of me if I’m wrong"
"Another great day for Baidu!! Most of the stocks gave back their big gains from earlier this week, but Baidu held!!! Why? Because it’s insanely discounted!!!! Stock should be easily 1000/share"
"Lesson learned -doesn't matter how great a company is, how much money they have, how much profit they make, how innovative they are, how smart they are. You can still lose your shirt unless you are here for 5 years. If you are unable to park your money in a stock for 5 years then be ready to lose it. I made a fortune in the market over the past 10 months and lost it all in just 4 months with this great stock, this great company, I made fun of Cathy Wood but she was smart to start selling at $350.You cant blame the CCP.This thing started to drop from the fake US delisting news story, that was generated from a bill from 2020Then Cathy sellingThen ArchegosThen Delisting againThen Cathy selling againThen CCPThen DIDIThen TALThen Covid? Really??I can not wait to see what is the next thing they will use to knock it down more"
Bought some yesterday at around 152. I don't think it will fall much more..
Don't know about yall but I'm buying more and more as it dips~
Baidu announces new chip and RoboCar!!!! Wow!!! In a normal market this stock would be up 20-30 on the news.
All I’ve heard for the past four months since it crashed to $220 was how undervalued Bidu was as I’ve watched my investment shrink more and more day by day by day. Now it’s down $55 per share from $220 and zero end in sight. CCP want to own all these companies on the cheap and they will have them.
"$EDU rising 9%+ in HK, and thanks to China's SEC hosting emergency meeting to calm investors, HangSeng rose 2.7% and Chinese indices all rose 1-2% so far. Tomorrow likely another good day for Chinese stocks including $EDU, $TAL, $BABA, $BIDU, $PDD, $DIDI, $LKNCY, $DAO and many more."
"Worries of delisting and the continued crackdown is causing more anxiety for everyone, but at some point it just becomes funny when you begin to see negative enterprise values of certain cash cows begin to emerge. I'm not saying to double down, although, there seems to be long term entry points forming. It was interesting to see Luckin Coffee climb up lots on the OTC after it was delisted for a company with poor fundaments. Now imagine the bounce of a cash cow? But, what are the odds of non-GAAP financial measures leading to delisting ( when you have the likes of Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai stepping in with Alibaba) ? Plus, that's three years from now and lots can happen in 3 years. Or, could tensions between China and the US cause more turmoil in the markets? I hope mr. market keeps spilling blood in the streets because this is definitely creating opportunities. Best of luck everyone and hold on for this crazy ride."
Chart on Baidu is simply amazing. 140 to 355 then back down to 135 in just over a year. The one year chart looks like a scary ride you would seen at Disney World. I love the company but it may take some time for new investors to pour into the stock again.. Fundamentals are amazing. I’m holding my shares while BIDU hopefully buys back a bunch of stock. I think downside is getting fairly limited from here on out....
FYI. There is a $5bn share repurchase program in place. https://ir.baidu.com/news-releases/news-release-details/baidu-upsizes-share-repurchase-program-us45-billion
"$KWEB $TME, $HUYA, $DOYU $BILI $TCEHY $BABA $BIDUBe ready for a 20-50% spike in these stocks' prices - There will be a fast V-shaped recovery$IQ, which has lost the most value - even though it has not been hit by regulation - stands to launch straight up to 17+ 18, 19, 20+ targets are incoming.Everything China will fly like a phoenix."
"I hope investors bought the dip and are sitting tight. That’s why you don’t make the big money trading in and out of stocks. You miss the big rallies because your sitting on the sidelines after being scared away by perma bears and FUD Spreaders- like this benjo clown!! His crystal ball is broke again!! I feel sorry for those that follow these clowns and then wonder why there account hasn’t grown only to see the stock they were scared out of triple or more!! Do your homework and be rational!! Baidu’s a great company with great fundamentals-now if you can sit tight you’ll be greatly rewarded in the future!! Go Baidu and I repeat for the hundredth time THE BEST IS COMING SO SIT TIGHT OR MOVE ON ALREDY, because we’re all tired of the constant whining and perma bears predictions!!! "
"There are a lot of Ai companies, but the future of this industry will be decided by a few global titans with vast technological and data advantages over rest of the landscape. BIDU is one one of those few. I would not describe them as an absolute lock with competitors from Sohu and Google, but most of the others are total longshots. And Tencent could present disruptive competition.The other risk being that they become too powerful for the Chinese government's liking. But in Ai race, the Chinese have had their foot on the gas for awhile and remember, there is risk in all other alternatives anyways."
And the reason for the further selloff after a good earnings report is Sell the news?? I'm not getting it.
"$BIDU generates much higher revenue and profit than $NVDA BUBBLE, but BIDU Market value is only $47 Billion vs $500 Billion NVDA Tulip Mania BUBBLE! WHY? Because NVDA Tulip Mania BUBBLE is registered in the US..."
moved all my assets from BABA to BIDU and JD and so far so good!JACK MA will be arrested soon!
With BV at 101#$%$ is starting to get close to the point where you go to the bank and take out a personal loan to use for shares !!!!
Beautiful intraday chart after buying on the dip. Closing at the high of the day???
"$BIDU, and $IQ of who Baidu is the parent company of, have been the most compliant with CCP regulations.$BABA recently became compliant. $TCEHY is improving and had a huge buyer sweep in in Hong Kong Yesterday despite going down.All those stocks, and $TME, $HUYA, $DOYU and $BILI and the $KWEB ETF are overdue for a huge bounce.It will come very soon. Within 4 weeks.Every single stock will be higher than it was end of June by the beginning of September. Raging China bull is among us."
"Bidu has a eps of $19 .....and a P/E of 7 !!! I have Never seen that before the eps is higher than the P/E ? This stock long term HAS to gravitate back up when the smoke clears .... it's trading at $142 ...down from $350 , 1 yr high .... There's now way this stock is at it's value , they are making money every day , even 10 yrs from now they will make money ...it's one of the Biggest companies in China ! One of the best futures too ,"
Broke down and bought 100 shares today. Best deal out there.
"I've recapped $BABA $BIDU $HUYA and $DOYU earnings, plus collated all the latest news to do with China here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og7ccmpZyO4 (the news also apply to $TCEHY $JD $YY etc.)I was bullish on China last month, but the evidence strongly suggests that the market is going in the opposite direction. 5-year plan, SEC warnings, bad Chinese economy results. We've seen a lot of legal restrictions put in place and everything suggests that it will get even worse. I'm out of any Chinese stocks for the next few months, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the situation. Thoughts?"
Carl I can’t wait for this to turn and then u will vanish from the board loll
We will close 142
One things for sure one you see to many people bullish that usually means a market top doesn’t it??? We’ll we sure the hell have a lot of bears (all the sites/feeds out there not to mention Bloomberg and CNBC- dam do they love promoting fear and FUD)!!!! Now with so many people Bearish- I say keep them coming because just like to many bulls usually signals a Market top too many bears (like we have now-just look at the bulls vs. bears chart) signal a market bottom!! I sure they hell wouldn’t want to be holding a short or long puts knowing this could riphigher at any minute!! Go Baidu best is coming for sure!! Beijing Olympics here we come great PR moment for Baidu to showcase it’s innovation and technology’s￼!!! 
"Of course Baidu is ripping in honk Kong- they know and see what Baidu’s doing they can see and watch it everyday!! I think john said it or maybe Baidu 2500- either way if Baidu was a US company there stock would be easily 5 or 10x what it is now!! But don’t worry in the long run the market is a weighing machine and Baidu’s stock price will be weighed according-count on it if you can sit tight and think for yourself!! And no Baidu’s stock isn’t going to 100 or below it’s book value price (shut up already) all these dam perma bears/FUD spreaders always saying it’s going down, it’s going down-run run run no matter what!!! Now all of a sudden they all have PHD’s in Asia and US relations and pretend to know how to predict the future from there bed or couch!! All they do is sit around and watch Bloomberg or CNBC spread FUD and then repeat it!! There just trying to make money shorting the stock by making you run from your 5 or 10 bagger!! Go Baidu go!!! Nobody’s chasing me away from my company!! "
Bought my first 100 shares of BIDU today.
I bought BIDU/BABA/XPEV Nov 19 2021 calls this morning and they had been all in red until now - FYIHope Chinese stocks did hit the bottom today
Baidu announcing some of the most exciting developments!!! Once the dust clears out from the ccp we are going straight back to 300
Heading side way showing support great  153 is strong  when they scare you buy
Shorts are being falling the trap by Xi Jinping??? Yeshe has made Chinese stocks like falling from the sky so Chinese folks and the government can load them at so cheap!
"Shorts - Covid crippled the world and we recovered higher than ever and we still have covid!!! This China news is so overblown, u will learn an expensive lesson!!! I’m not buying every Chinese stock but will buy Bidu and a few others!! Bidu is like apple/Tesla/Google/amzn rolled up in 1"
With this price action a short squeeze is sooner or later inevitable.
Back to 180
"I’ve got $5000 in Baidu calls for the next 2 weeks! See you at $180-185+ tomorrow. If not, I don’t mind! More shares for me ;)"
Increased my position by 50%
This is a stronger buy here!
"$57B market cap for a company that generates over $3B profit, flushed with $10B+ net cash, leader is all China search, and growing fast in 3 disruptive businesses, ai, cloud, autonomous 35 analysts have a $300+ average stock price target  They beat both revenue & profit estimates. For guidance, they project solid 20% yoy growth.Stock is in doghouse "
why are they raising debt with all that cash on the books?
"I mean, I understand people’s hesitation here but man o man if this China thing resolves, this stock is going to explode lol"
This company is worth way more than $50bn. At least $100bn. Probably 5x if a USA company
China squeeze this afternoonHold onto your shares!
I am doing the opposite of what Cathie Wood does: buying low instead of high. I think I am the genius here 
The people that missed BIDU the last 10 years have a once in a lifetime chance. Don't cry later if you didn't buy it now.
Bought another 5000 shares today. Great company!!

I think it’s a fair statement when I say that Baidu is the cheapest stock of a profitable company in the entire world..
Bidu the jewel of the stock market!!! Such an incredible company!!!
Am I seeing this right up 10 percent 
Looks like some money rotating out of baba and into here
Baidu Core revenue growing 27% year-over-year accelerated by non-advertising revenues with AI cloud growing 71% year-over-year in the second quarter
Oversold and short covering expiration= Bounce
For the life of me I can't understand why China is doing this to their great companies. Thoughts?
US markets like a one party system where someone tells people to sell Chinese stocks and everybody has to obey. The only difference between the US and China is that in China CCP makes decisions openly and announce to public while in US the decisions are made behind closed doors by the ruling elite.
Yahoo Finance BIDU: Bearish pattern detected Fair Value Undervalued 34% est. return.
Time to turn this ship around and head north
"Is anyone buying more, adding to positions?"
At What price do we see a big gap up?? This was so oversold!!
I am starting a position now!
"Bidu P/B is at 0.2. TSLA P/B at 28. By normalizing BIDU P/B to 2, not even 28, which is ""reasonable"" for a tech company, its share price should be $1,373.3 per share. When there is uncertainty, the price tends to fall more than expected, it is time to accumulate this until the risks become certain. By then, people will realize they were panicking over nothing significant and will rush in to buy this gem."
"Watch the squeeze today. All Chinese stocks so oversold, time for a mega rebound"
Anybody think once it’s over 150 next is 175-200 range
"Buy now, dont regret later when the train has left."
Alphabet inoffiziellere China……a batrgain.For me a century opportunity. I am buying like sorros.
