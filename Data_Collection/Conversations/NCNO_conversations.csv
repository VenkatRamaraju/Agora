long term great stock with wells Fargo deal. profit taking is possible tomorrow.
"I don't get it. This is a cutting-edge software company trying to disrupt the entire banking industry. This is exciting stuff, yet there are 264 posts on this board, very little news to find, and the stock has little volume to speak of."
How you like them apples?
Beat on top and bottom number and bringing in Wells as a new customer. Tell me why we shouldn't return to all time highs?
I've stuck with nCino all the way down to -30% and while I'm still in the red I hope this is a turning point. It's not that it's undervalued - it's that it's completely off the radar. Hopefully this Wells Fargo news put's it on the Radar and makes everyone else realise the potential for this company.

"Asking for help. I'm considering investing in nCino, as everything I've read about the company seems to say that it has a very bright future. The only thing that scares me is the valuation. Is this a good time to enter, or is waiting for a pullback the wiser decision? Thanks for any insights."
Expect a run to 80$ in a month.

"I think NCNO is finally getting noticed now... with 2/4 US big banks under contract, it can only gain more street cred... now IF we can add either C or, less likely cuz they tend to do their own thing, JPM, we're set for a long time... GLTA... holding for a long-term investment, esp with CRM as a venture capital investor..."
