"I got out last month @ $90.50 or so i believe... Was holding 2000 shares... I have been buying back ever since at every $2.00 drop, 200 shares each time.... $82 is a great entry point for anybody out there that wants a great company at a great price with a decent dividend yield... $80 to $100 should be the trading range..."
What happened after closing today?
"Check out the HF Shorts on the message board talking down AEP, it is a well organized campaign when the shorts target a stock. They might get more resistance than they bargain for w/ this company. It's well run and good dividends, steady eddy."
time to sell ????
"With coordinated short selling, there is a multi pronged approach to drive the share price down. It usually starts with negative press, and Pundits talking down the SP. In my opinion I believe that's what's happening with AEP . If this is the case, I think they've bitten off a little more than they can chew. We'll see where the share price goes, but Hundreds of millions $$$ of share value is at stake ."
sweet! who doesn't like a raise?.74 to .78 :)
"Increase on dividends next quarter, enjoy! I'm a very happy retiree"
"AEP is being targeted by HF Shorts, but fundamentals are positive. Great dividends and earnings. I bet they get burned."
13 red days in a row that is almost unheard of
Action required BOD
Has to be the most overpriced utility at the moment. They need to diversify towards renewables. They aren’t even trying it seems
"12 days of sell off. I get the few days when the entire market was down. I listened to the last two earnings report. Overall looks ok, something about SEC and AEP submitting whatever they asked for."
"""I can also share that we expect that the sale(Kentucky) will be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive in 2022""From the CFO"
"Yes it is, HF Shorts manipulating the SP, they use their vast amounts of $ to sell down the SP.and usually involves dark pools w/ synthetic shares. Is there a difference between someone holding a gun or a man in a Pinstripe Suit w/ a bag of cash to steal your investment ?"
Is robert the only guy in this forum?
"All it would take for a share price rebound would be for management to announce a share buy back, and this would throttle the short selling. Millions have already have been wiped of capitalization in the last several days ."
Won’t the rise in natural gas price (highest since 2014) increase cost for AEP and reduce profits?
Smart move by AEP to sell Kentucky Power. It is the least profitable of all the AEP operating companies. The $1.45B net proceeds will eliminate the need for a new stock offering in 2022.
"Ah, dividend increase. :)"
Why the big jump after hours?
