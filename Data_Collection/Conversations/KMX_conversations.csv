Shakin the tree to buy low shares. MM know the algorithms.It will end up higher than yesterday and Dow will be lower
how it this now down under $80 already.. Wow hardly no money 1st quarter
"@Chad-Yep, I too gave up at the exact wrong time sadly. When something becomes irrational you don't know how long it can stay that way or how much more irrational it will get. Funny how I don't seem to see what seemed like the daily KMX pump from Barrons on Yahoo Finance anymore (which was really just click bait for a Barron's subscription). And didn't Cramer fall in love wih KMX for like a day or something. I hope this melts back up in the short term for another shot at it. Take a look at URI. It is another stock that wont stop melting up. It has had the hurricane bump, the tax bump, the infrastructure bump, etc. but at the end of the day it is just a tool rental company. At some point its all priced in and its a long drop back to the 40's where it was not that long ago. Even to $100 wouldn't be bad. But the more irrational it gets the more people pile in (Cramer just had CEO on),"

"Price target raised and Overweight rating maintained by Morgan Stanley, I'm hoping this can give my weak-looking Baby a boost today, and maybe we can get back a few percent, at least to the $95/shr level... December 22, 2019 4:43 PM ESTMorgan Stanley analyst Armintas Sinkevicius raised the price target on CarMax (NYSE: KMX) to $112.00 (from $107.00) while maintaining a Overweight rating."

"This morning KMX was down below 60, now I check and it's 64+. I don't see any news. What caused that?"
"Huge inventories of vehicles (at CarMax, Hertz, etc.)...sales sucking...growth plans for new stores being slashed...operations cut to the bone AND the stock is trading near its 52 week high. Maybe the sellers that drove it down to $37 were wrong. Maybe everyone else is a bit optimistic?"

I expect record profits. The government is using our children and grand-children's tax money to give to unemployed people today due to the virus. Many of them will buy cars.
"With the rising prices in used cars +10% in April and +7% in May I decided to sell my third car that I paid 13,400 for in 2017. A Kia Optima, I tried out the process on 3 sites. Carvana offered me $14,966, Shift offered $13,900+200 bonus = $14,1000, and Carmax offered me $14,100.Carvana could come pick my car up in a month on July 9th or I could take it to nearest location (1,000 miles away).Carmax I have to take the car to the closest location (50 miles).Shift they can come to my house in 4-hours and pick it up or I can take it to the nearest location (50 miles).As I shareholder I like the margins Shift $SFT would give the company (don't like that I get less) as the car I have is listed for about $17,500 on all 3 sites with close mileage. I also like the service Shift offers vs Carmax $KMX of coming out to get it and even in my case same day. Carvana $CVNA offered the best price which means less margin for the company, and the same luxury of not having to leave home. I was blown away that they would come so far to get my car (but again, that eats at their bottom line). Now, I chose to sell it to Carvana because I don't need a quick sell and can afford to wait. So Carvana will ultimately get the product and be able to sell it. So, if they do huge volume in the end Carvana would be the winner by stealing all the cars from Shift or Carmax by paying better? Just some things to think about.I would say from my quick experience, and if my area where SHIFT is and CARVANA isn't I would rate them 1) Shift 2) Carvana 3) Carmax."
may go back below $80 now. states shutting down again get out while you can people. i mean that in the nicest way dont hold the bag...

KMX reached a new All Time High at 78.43
Seaport Global buy TGT 113-if they announce online it should spike to the 100S.
"KMX had a an Analyst Day a couple of weeks ago.....nothing new but they are clearly worried that this ridiculous stock price and out performance versus other used car companies cannot last. So analysts had to say some nice things about them afterwards (that is how the game works) but there appeared to be no new news (Omni channel blah blah blah, data as a service blah blah blah, reconditioning cars blah blah blah)."
No brainer! KMX@120 by 01/08/21.
KMX back to almost all time highs......so guess what.........yep.....you got it......Cramer pumping it right now. Cramer told everyone for 8 weeks not to buy....it was a fake rally......raise cash. So if you listened to him you missed one of the biggest rallies ever. But now he says buy. Cramer loves buy high and sell low.
Let's Rock
$105 tomorrow?
Smart money sneaks in next stop $140+ very soon
I don't get it. Beat on earnings and revenues. Increased same store sales. And down???? Why
Can someone explain where 0.23 EPS came from?? I am not getting that number
Buy the dip! KMX will be back up around $100 pretty soon. Good buying opportunity!
"Kmx current quarter will be huge ... stay invested, cheap stock compared to peers"
"On a great day like this , how does KMX go in the opposite direction?"
What just happened today? no news at all
Will this drop once it hits 76?
"Ok, I just took a short position at $94.19. Lot's of potential profit, not much downside. Trading at pre-covid nosebleed levels. I live next to a massive Carmax in Vegas, and I bought two cars from there back in 2018. Was in there the other day, they are dead dead dead dead. Lots of inventory needing written down too. Horrible financials. Another Hertz"
Looks like a buying opportunity
KMX reached a 52 Week low at 48.88
Hey KMX treasury! It's ok to buy when the stock is low. No need to wait until its high again.
Loading up!!!
Just a little tip Sales are up 125% at my location. Business is still great.
"Started a small position today at $93 and will add to it on further pullback. CarMax is doing well and have been upping there game with new focus of online, curbside and delivery options. This should be well over $100 per share by next year and probably before even year end."
If your here because of the momentum then your here for the wrong reasons. I suggest if your new to $UXIN that you go study the $KMX chart.
$86.5 call for 09/27 at $2.88
Crushed it!
KMX to rip higher with new car prices race higher.
"Why did they crash last report? From what I'm seeing, they absolutely crushed expectations."
Even Carlotz goes public! We know how accelerating used car market in economic down-term now and the next 5 years! This is the only cheap value stock out there! It’s going expensive soon! 
"Are you selling 18 X as many vehicles today, as November 2008 when this stock was under $8 ?No ? Well, well, well, how do you support the $16 billion DEBT load ? With depreciating inventory ?"

"Very weak day for KMX, not happy with the action at all. If this was a normal trading week I would definitely close out my position this afternoon and move on to my next play, But...Christmas week is lacking in good earnings release plays, and I think this baby has bottomed out just above $89, so I will stay with her for tomorrow, and MAYBE until Thursday morning at the latest.

"how does KMX even be trading higher than pre covid? with many out of work and some regularly working from home, is there a reason to buy a car now? or how about Htz bk? how will that affect KMX? irrational exuberant ey?"
KMX will post a huge beating ER next week!
KMX implemented a very strong online marketing campaign along with wholesale and other marketing tactics which resulted a very strong quarter. Summer is almost here and lot more people will be buying cars that will translate to even stronger than expected profit in next quarter. That could possibly push the KMX shares price up over $100. Good luck to you all.
Earnings on Friday morning. How we looking?
KMX is up 9.71% to 77.95
"KMX and other used car dealers (Carvana) will see a significant revenue decline in the next 6-9 months not because there is a lack of demand, but lack of supply. With automakers reducing supply because of chip shortage, new car dealers will not provided trade ins to auctions and wholesalers because they will be selling less too. Rental car companies will do the same and hold onto any and all cars. KMX and Carvana rely heavily on the new car dealer and auction houses. KMX and Carvana will still sell cars at record profit per unit, but number of units will be reduced significantly by year's end. This will not hurt KMX as bad as it will hurt Carvana because Carvana still has not turned a profit and hoped that more volume would eventually push them to a profit. Enjoy this Qtr, but I would sell before Q3 conference call on Sept/Oct."

"Just sold a put at $50 strike; I'm hoping it continues down enough to assign and I'll get the shares a little cheaper (if not, I can't complain too much about keeping the premium).I think overall this economic pain will continue for a while.

I think the auto parts stores and their suppliers will also fare well in the recovery as people try to keep their current vehicles on the road."

"Out KMX at $88.87 for a substantial loss. Time to ditch this baby and move on. Tried to Sell Short NIO as an Earnings play, but no luck. Broker wanted a huge hard-to-borrow fee and I never pay those. So I went with my backup, a valuation/technical play of SINA Long. SINA is extremely undervalued right now, and over the next few days could pop up significantly, as China and the trade deal are likely to be in the news frequently. I think SINA has short-term upside potential to the mid 40's. I jumped in with 1700 shares at $38.54. I might hold this one for a few days, as my next likely earnings play, LW to the Long side, does not report until January 3rd. Good Luck to All! :-)"
Why up in after hours?
Come on KMX management......buy back more of your over priced stock! BURN some more shareholder money.
So they beat fake earnings estimates by a penny.Look at y.o.y scary bad!
"Cash $388Mm, debts out of this world!Worst value! Do your homework! Wait for 40% drop fir fair value!"

"Just a little tip/insider. Im an employee at carmax. Carmax is opening brand new stores by next year in different states. They’ve been selling more cars than ever during the pandemic. They’re also most likely more profitable than caravana & have better quality too. Each car goes thru varies inspections, they get detailed, painted if needed, dents removed. To the best of my knowledge caravana doesn’t fix defects on their used vehicles. They also have multiple side businesses too. They buy older vehicles & auction them off. They sell customers extended warranties for their cars. Carmax is a great company & is doing great business. That’s why I invested in them. Overtime they should be worth more than caravana."
"Hi, I have no position in $kmx and $cnva, but want to ask this hypothetical question:Q. If there all of sudden economy shoots up and people start buy used cars like crazy, then which of the two will be able to efficiently and successfully satisfy their customers: $KMX or $CVNA ?"
"share-based compensation is unpredictable. It added $19 millions. Otherwise, the EPS at least meet or slight beats."
BEAT top and bottom line trading down=== makes a lot of sense for WS
"One Analyst downgraded the stock yet raised tgt price, did not make any sense. Check out how all other analysts raised target price on KMX. Go long and KMX share price will go up to $90 in a short time."

"KMX CEO sold 86,762 shares worth over $7.0M on 6/25/19. Isn't the company doing a massive share repurchase program? So they are buying back stock using shareholder money which runs up the stock and at the same time the CEO is selling HIS stock. Ok.....got it."
Unemployment will be record highs. People won’t be buying any cars. People don’t want to test drive used cars and catch the virus. How much debt do they have??? Easy short on this headfake rebound.
KMX is the next tesla. companies with massive unsustainable debt are now better than gold due to the fed's active buying of junk bonds. Strange but there is no risk for investing in companies that go deeply unprofitable.
So they have over 15 BILLION in debt and NEGATIVE cash flow? https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KMX/key-statistics?p=KMXWhat could go wrong? ;)
KMX is a great buy now on this dip! Buying opportunity!
not looking good 
The article below tries to explain why KMX is down.
RBC raises price target to 108. It should below through that on earnings tomorrow.
CEOs who borrow money during a rising interest rate environment so that they can buy back their own stock at ALL TIME HIGHS just to boost their own stock options should go the same way as Elon Musk. In a few years when this stock is at $20/share they wont care one bit as THEY got rich. What a tremendous waste of money and destruction of true shareholder value.
"Why the hell is this only trading at $93 and that pile of dog excrement Carvana is trading at $240 today?Carmax is a solid company, well managed, and will pick up the leftovers when the ""tech"" car companies go bust next year. I guess KMX doesn't pay the sell side analysts."

Will drop today
"KMX is oversold at this point. Strong support here around the $93-$94 range. Seems it has bottomed around here, and should begin to climb back up. Good luck all!"
"Carmax reported selling more cars than ever this year . Which makes sense considering the fact that a lot of Americans received stimulus checks and unemployment payments. Some people I talked to managed to save 10k or more, resulting in the opportunity to finally buy themselves a car. They’re also opening new stores in different states. They’re taking a more aggressive approach to competition. This company is definitely a buy. If you review the chart you can see their revenue has increased substantially every year. There will also always be a market for used cars. What separates Carmax from the competition is their willingness to professionally detail and restore their inventory of cars. I once bought a car from a dealership only to realize the headlights were oxidized, not to mention the salesman tried scamming me significantly. I always thought that was a myth lol until I saw how everyone at the dealership only saw a $ sign instead of a customer. Anyways Carmax has a building dedicated to fixing these cosmetic and serious issues. They have dedicated mechanics, professional paint departments and detailer a. I’ve Also seen reviews of carvana on YouTube and it appears to be the norm to receive a car with defects. I’m definitely putting my money on carmax when it comes to the business of used cars. Every other competitor is trying to reach the level of carmax but will fail to do so. Carvana is a complete joke when you think about it. I won’t go into details but they will most likely go bankrupt in the future. The smart way to buy a car definitely goes to carmax and when people realize this, this stock will be highly valued. That’s why I’m long on this stock. Can’t wait for the reports coming up!"
Today’s chart is steadily beautiful!
What happened at end of day today? Large short covering their position pre earnings to be safe or did something leak?
Hey I’m new around here. Looking for a good entry point in Carmax I certainly believe the used car market is going to be hot for the next 2-3 qrts. Was thinking $129. Anybody think it’s going to go lower than that?
With a good earnings call should turn green today
"Went Long on KMX a few hours ago, 650 shares at $98.57. This is an earnings play, I expect tomorrow morning's earnings release to be very good, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with upward Guidance. That should result in a nice pop up in stock price. I am looking for the $108 level. This stock is fairly valued, which is why I chose to play her instead of NKE, which was and is overvalued. I like the sector, and financials are solid."
Once market opens it will go back up
"These companies weren’t worth this Pre-Pandemic, but now somehow today, with no business, they are worth more? Lol! I guess they could double from here. Inflation is upon us. Your dollars will be worth half or less so who cares what the stock price says. I guess we should all just start going long. It makes sense, don’t fight the Fed. Unlimited money supply."
Reversal to $140.
No volume-free to fall-need a solid report DEC.
They need a BLOW OUT report DEC-the debt is high-need to announce on line program-internet.
"This things headed for the crapper. Almost out of cash, loan defaults, lower sales and pricing....Run Forest, Run."
"Are the cars KMX sells made of solid gold or something? LAD reported and tanked. Other car/auto companies have done the same (gone down). This thing just keeps going up to all time highs, day after day......Congress absolutely needs to stop share repurchases. When this all blows up, there will be hearings led by all of our worthless politicians about this topic and how a few CEO's got filthy rich as they essentially looted the company's balance sheet to buy back stock at ridiculous prices."
"If earnings are not a total home run, then this turd should tank. Auto Nation reported a profit, $KMX hiring 3,500 new salesmen this year. If they're still losing money given this? Sheesh, what can the paid pumpers possibly say now?"
Why is this red? They beat on EPS and the revenue plus better guidance
What’s going on with Carmax?
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
So what is the thesis here that keeps driving this stock up when everyone knows the auto cycle is rolling over AND there are lots of problems in sub prime auto leasing? Is the used car cycle supposed to be better when new car sales are weak?
gonna bust through the $150 price point pretty soon
Pay $58 a share for used car salesmen that pays no dividend?
Will end the day Down this going below $90
Ship will sink tom 
So now that it isn't going up every day Barron's stopped pumping it non-stop. I remember when Barron's represented responsible value type investing. They sure lost their bearings.....
Where are the analysts? They should upgrade this stock to strong buy. This whole thing is a joke. 120 is the near term target in my book.
"The Virus will truly SLOW the market for New & Used cars. Who is going to venture out to car lots and purchase a large ticket (and depreciating) item during these several weeks.?? Not Me.! People will 'hunker down"" until the virus clears-out. Prices of cars will be LESS, and financing will have near zero interest rates."
"Years ago I woke up to the news a large fund had sold KMX & the stock was at 1 5/8. I bought what I could and sold it weeks later for $ 4-6.Tom Gaynor was smarter, he waited till in was over $ 100"
"Buy some KMX shares, then just sell some covered calls against your shares while you wait for this to rebound. Win-win!"
Nice gain today. I believe this will continue to rebound back up from here. It shouldn’t be too much longer before this is $100 plus. Good luck all!
They report good numbers but still early to go long ..
Potato Stock
BK baby!!!!
"Has Carmax ever made an announcement that they appear to have partnered with Rocket Mortgage's ""Rocket Auto"" used car sales and financing business? Looks like many of the cars listed on Rocket Auto are actually Carmax vehicles. This may help Carmax in the competition with other online used car retailers like Carvana who probably aren't on Rocket Auto (although they might be too)."
any insight about this upcomming earnings?
If Harley Davidson $HOG had great earnings then $KMX should do well too.
"Even toyota $TM is up 15 percent in the past week or so! Every car stock will dominate the world. Nobody wants used cars any more. They all want new new new . But still, used car stocks like $KMX are ON FIRE!!! Used cars are red hot. All autos are red hot. Everyone is staying at home because of covid but autos are the hottest investments since sliced bread."
It’s going back back to 89.

Guys should I buy this today
It’ll be below 100 by Friday!
"Haha, short sellers are totally got squeezed. So good to see KMX going up and up. In no days it will back to $80. This is a very Well run company and it just returned the government loan. God has mercy on us. Summer is coming and the virus will leave us soon as it’s witnessed in lot of places in the world. We will slowly go back to our normal activities. Ppl need cars to go back to work especially used cars as working ppl don’t have too much to spend. Used cars can be easily wiped down with disinfectant wipes, If there are virus they will be killed. God Bless America."

KMX is down -4.92% to 60.64
I see a bright future for the co.
They will probably change their name to CarBlockchain. That will give them a boost.
If you love KMX why not jump in UXIN @ $1.40. They are the KMX of China and used car sales are ramping. The risk is low at $1.40 and the reward is huge---looking at 10+ by year end.

Glad I bought KMX yesterday. This should go up to all-time high $81.67. But $72.36 is my target. Hope I do well with it.Good luck to all and congratulations to longs.
Used car prices continue weakness with lots of cars coming off lease. Not good for KMX as the value of their inventory decreases every day. Lots of resistance around $60. Good spot to get short.

"Read the numbers stock should be under $70net earnings plunged to $5 million, or 3 cents a share, from $266.7 million, or $1.59 a share, in the comparable year-earlier period"
AN has half the shares as KMX and doesn't make the money KMX does.
"UXIN the China Vroom got there $... better hurry, came from from 9..back to it!"
I guess the next upgrade and raise of price Target will bring a bigger sell-off
Picked up some 91.90 AVG 93S-sit wait for DEC report.
short .period.
Chad sounds like he has missed the run up in the market
Will this stock ever go up again?
Glad I sold this dog with a decent gain.
Negative cash flow from ops last 4 years and laying on $5B of debt. That is not the right direction for metrics. Dangerous level of debt as we head into recession next year.
Come on car max.
Will be back in 40s next week and retest and break through the low the week after.
"Still long 650 shares of KMZ at $98.57. Earnings report did not go my way, but gonna stay patient for a day or two, see what happens Monday and Tuesday. We might see some bargain hunting and technical oversold factors result in a price rebound, although I doubt we can go Green. Researching some pre-earnings plays this weekend, and CMC is looking very good to me for upside potential over the next 10 days, leading up to earnings release on January 6th. I might play her on Tuesday, probably not to hold all the way through Jan 6th, but looking for a 4%+/- pop before the actual release. Good Luck to All!"
11% rise on mixed earnings? Lookout for profit takers the next few days.
Hyped on Bloomberg radio yesterday and today ... ... ...
Worst stock ever. Doesn’t have volume and purposely announced earnings on Friday.
CarMax is down 9.52% to 62.60

Carmax really is a great company.
Earnings 12-22 should pop into 100S

Why are we down today? What do you guys have against this stock? Enlight me
How is this stock green after that guidance?
"Honestly, this is the exact sign of a fraud...just keeps going up. The entire market should be valued at half. Instead, they will run this thing to news highs, raise prices at the stores, pay you the same wages and tell you your doing so great. Calling it now, 35K DJ before end of the year...the rig is in my friends. Just go along and stay Long! Free money!"
This stock will do nothing but grow
"KMX will drop back to the $40s. Two problems here. Demand is minimal. People aren't driving much. People also don't want to go out in public and a used car lot sounds like a great place to catch a virus. Second problem is the price of cars is significantly dropping. All that inventory they have on the lot will need to be revalued. Their margins will erode. Ah, forgot the third problem and fourth problem. People are now expecting to get very cheap financing. And finally with what will end up being 20-30M unemployed people, a ton of people are going to default on their loans for cars they previously bought at KMX. This is a perfect storm."

I sold a call at 1100 strike expiring in June I bought a September 1000 put and sold June 1000 put. I expect earnings in July going to disappoint.
"I have to ask a question and just want honest answers...so here it is...Take away the “Earnings and Revenue Analyst estimates” and read that report, would anybody be surprised if this thing went to $50ps?$100ps? Lmao!This business model is dead. There is no way for omnichannel to work long term, not enough employees or too high of an expense for this business. Dead in the water in this environment and NOBODY wants a used, germ infested car when they can get a brand new one at the same rates. Dead I tell ya, dead!Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but say goodbye to this business as we know it."
"Looking to get out of KMX today at $90.00 with a significant loss. Time to move on. Thing is, this Bad Baby is still trending down. I'm looking at NIO as my next big Earnings play, to the Short side. They report pre-market on Monday and that stock is looking very weak. Terrible financials, and everything points to a very poor earnings release that fails to meed consensus estimates. Huge Short interest on NIO, broker says I have to have 200% margin for the short, but I think I'm still going to play her, unless she goes down a lot from her current level."
"Positive sentiment by Morningstar after the poor earnings release:We See CarMax in a Strong Position Despite Stock Selling Off on Third-Quarter Results2:28 PM ET 12/20/19 | MorningstarCarMax's stock fell over 6% on Dec. 20 after it announced fiscal 2020 third-quarter results that missed Refinitiv's consensus of $1.16. EPS declined 4.6% year over year to $1.04 despite strong same store unit growth of 7.5%. This same-store sales performance along with our belief going into earnings that the stock was overvalued is why we are not changing our fair value estimate. We expect continued strong demand for used vehicles in calendar 2020 as vehicles coming off-lease are projected to be similar to the low 4 million unit levels the U.S. saw in 2019 and the lending environment does not suggest a major pullback in credit availability.Elevated SG&A spending hurt CarMax in the quarter with CarMax's stock rising contributing to a $0.09 EPS hit in the quarter. SG&A increased $75 million year over year, or 18.3%, and stock compensation expense contributed $19 million of the increase. Advertising also rose 38.8%, which management planned for due to a new national advertising campaign and to advertise the omnichannel digital and brick and mortar experience CarMax now offers. The company has also opened 19 stores since the start of third-quarter fiscal 2019 and these newer stores are often a SG&A headwind until they scale up. Management guides to comparable store unit sales growth of 5% to 8% to leverage SG&A. Continued investment that leads to profitable growth is not a problem to us and another reason we are not changing our fair value estimate.We also think omnichannel investment is the right move to keep CarMax competitive in the digital age versus upstarts such as Carvana. We also find it interesting that in May CarMax increased its standard limited warranty to 90 days from 30, which we think may have happened partly to rival Carvana's standard 100-day limited warranty. About 40% of CarMax customers have access to omnichannel, a majority will have it by the end of fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2021 will see the rollout completed."
Buy WTW is going up
Only hope for share price today will be very strong guidance for next quarter.
can someone can explain to me why the stock is consistently going down ?
I did some growth comparisons on some of the stocks that people have mentioned on Carvana conversations board. And Carvana stands out as the best growth stock without any doubt. Carvana has done an astonishing exceptional job in the past year growing at high speed through the pandemic. This is the comparison:$CVNA revenues grew 41% for the past year$VRM revenues grew 14% for the past year$CARG revenues declined by 6% for the past year$KMX revenues declined by 7% for the past year$PAG revenues declined by 12% for the past yearLooks like Carvana is taking market shares away from competitors very aggressively. The Carvana management has really done a very impressive job!
I expect $100 by the end of the month
"overpriced ridiculous stock. Used care prices are CRASHING and the Big 3 are giving new cars away. Good luck with this overpriced turd. I'd be a seller up here. PE of like 70, OMG."
Looks like lots of people were looking for a reason to sell. Volume in first 30 minutes exceeds daily average. That’s BAD. Anyone hear anything about guidance?
KMX is down 10.33% to 48.27
"This last 5 min tick looks like a reversal...The earnings were good. this is just some profit taking that is all... back up soon, or now."
What's the morning price look like here?
How tricky is it? They bought up at the last second! LOL
