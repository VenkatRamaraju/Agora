I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
$5 billion in stock buybacks and no dividend. This is not a growth stock. So why no dividend.
"Carmax reported selling more cars than ever this year . Which makes sense considering the fact that a lot of Americans received stimulus checks and unemployment payments. Some people I talked to managed to save 10k or more, resulting in the opportunity to finally buy themselves a car. They’re also opening new stores in different states. They’re taking a more aggressive approach to competition. This company is definitely a buy. If you review the chart you can see their revenue has increased substantially every year. There will also always be a market for used cars. What separates Carmax from the competition is their willingness to professionally detail and restore their inventory of cars. I once bought a car from a dealership only to realize the headlights were oxidized, not to mention the salesman tried scamming me significantly. I always thought that was a myth lol until I saw how everyone at the dealership only saw a $ sign instead of a customer. Anyways Carmax has a building dedicated to fixing these cosmetic and serious issues. They have dedicated mechanics, professional paint departments and detailer a. I’ve Also seen reviews of carvana on YouTube and it appears to be the norm to receive a car with defects. I’m definitely putting my money on carmax when it comes to the business of used cars. Every other competitor is trying to reach the level of carmax but will fail to do so. Carvana is a complete joke when you think about it. I won’t go into details but they will most likely go bankrupt in the future. The smart way to buy a car definitely goes to carmax and when people realize this, this stock will be highly valued. That’s why I’m long on this stock. Can’t wait for the reports coming up!"

"Has Carmax ever made an announcement that they appear to have partnered with Rocket Mortgage's ""Rocket Auto"" used car sales and financing business? Looks like many of the cars listed on Rocket Auto are actually Carmax vehicles. This may help Carmax in the competition with other online used car retailers like Carvana who probably aren't on Rocket Auto (although they might be too)."
"Read the numbers stock should be under $70net earnings plunged to $5 million, or 3 cents a share, from $266.7 million, or $1.59 a share, in the comparable year-earlier period"
gonna bust through the $150 price point pretty soon
"Never buy PEAK, greed hurts"
"New car chip shortage, means increased demand for used cars. Increased demand during reopening means higher profit margins. Expecting a blowout ER"

"Are you selling 18 X as many vehicles today, as November 2008 when this stock was under $8 ?No ? Well, well, well, how do you support the $16 billion DEBT load ? With depreciating inventory ?"
"Went Long on KMX a few hours ago, 650 shares at $98.57. This is an earnings play, I expect tomorrow morning's earnings release to be very good, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with upward Guidance. That should result in a nice pop up in stock price. I am looking for the $108 level. This stock is fairly valued, which is why I chose to play her instead of NKE, which was and is overvalued. I like the sector, and financials are solid."

"With the rising prices in used cars +10% in April and +7% in May I decided to sell my third car that I paid 13,400 for in 2017. A Kia Optima, I tried out the process on 3 sites. Carvana offered me $14,966, Shift offered $13,900+200 bonus = $14,1000, and Carmax offered me $14,100.Carvana could come pick my car up in a month on July 9th or I could take it to nearest location (1,000 miles away).Carmax I have to take the car to the closest location (50 miles).Shift they can come to my house in 4-hours and pick it up or I can take it to the nearest location (50 miles).As I shareholder I like the margins Shift $SFT would give the company (don't like that I get less) as the car I have is listed for about $17,500 on all 3 sites with close mileage. I also like the service Shift offers vs Carmax $KMX of coming out to get it and even in my case same day. Carvana $CVNA offered the best price which means less margin for the company, and the same luxury of not having to leave home. I was blown away that they would come so far to get my car (but again, that eats at their bottom line). Now, I chose to sell it to Carvana because I don't need a quick sell and can afford to wait. So Carvana will ultimately get the product and be able to sell it. So, if they do huge volume in the end Carvana would be the winner by stealing all the cars from Shift or Carmax by paying better? Just some things to think about.I would say from my quick experience, and if my area where SHIFT is and CARVANA isn't I would rate them 1) Shift 2) Carvana 3) Carmax."
Ship will sink tom 
Smart money sneaks in next stop $140+ very soon
Where are the analysts? They should upgrade this stock to strong buy. This whole thing is a joke. 120 is the near term target in my book.
Looks like a buying opportunity
