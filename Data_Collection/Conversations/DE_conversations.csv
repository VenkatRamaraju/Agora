Pension plans have disappeared in the US decades ago and have been replaced by 401Ks. John Deere union members are living in the last century.
Deere tractors are too expensive anyway. Unions can bust another US company if they wish. I sold my shares.
"I never liked Unions. But they are paying people during a global supply chain shortage. Share holders make money, Deere makes money, employees will get lesser deal in the end (unfortunately). The Union will get less and less willing to listen the more they pay strikes."
On the picket line for Christmas...a gift to Deere as it hires cheaper replacement workers.
"Strange the stock goes up so much when the judge just limits the number of pickets,,, union drivers are still not going to cross the line!"
Workers seem unconcerned if DE manufacturing goes offshore like so many other companies.
I’ll buy a few hundred shares if we see a pullback because of the strike.
De has more pricing power than cat IMO. Less competition. I prefer de to cat
Running full out with salaried workers. Maybe they can manage quite well without those union guys. Imagine the improvement in profit margin.

'bout time for some upward movement! Hopefully it will hold after Powell's speech.
"Like a Deere in the headlights or an early morning striker, this stock is bound to get run over"
I wonder how many of the strikers were around during the late 90s when the company kept workers cleaning and painting while there were no orders to fill?

"Grandpa: And that my grandson is why John Deere decided to leave the United States way back in '21.Grandson: And before that, there were things made right here? In our country?Grandpa: Yes.Grandson: I wish I could see something being made.Grandpa: I will take you to Mexico when you are 10.Grandson: Yay. Grandpa, what's a Union?Grandpa: A Union helps big companies to move out of our country.Grandson: Can I see one?Grandpa: Well, there aren't any here anymore, but when we go to Mexico, we will ask.Grandson. Yay."
"""The company expects to see solid double-digit growth in production rates for crop care products in fiscal 2022. While government support is expected to decrease this year, total crop cash receipts in the United States will likely be up 19.7% on higher commodity prices, primarily soybean and corn. The U.S customer sentiment has gone up over the last few quarters with elevated exports to China. Considering these factors, Deere projects the fiscal 2021 net income in the band of $5.7-$5.9 billion, up from the prior guidance of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion."""
DE might just replace workers with robots. 5-6% increase in salary with enhanced benefits isn’t bad. I wish I got a 6% raise this year.
"More than 10,000 Deere & Co. workers went on strike Thursday after ""the company failed to present an agreement that met our members' demands and needs,"" the United Auto Workers union said in statement. Down 2.5 % in pre"
Greedy Deere union workers have a better deal than General Motors workers and they want more. The UAW was shocked they voted down the generous negotiated contract that they and Deere put forward last week.
guess which DE employee got a 160% raise this year.
Fast food is looking for workers and might just consider hiring a former Deere union worker after they are replaced by immigrants.
PE: 19.25EPS: 17.24 1y Target Est: 400.82Market Cap: 102.891BThose are Ken Griffey Jr. career numbers!
I guess this should move up when the strike is over
What took so long? Was hoping it would dip today. Grrrr...
"de can reach $700 in one year, because demand strong at least 5years,"
They have not had a strike in 35 years. The union employees know they have a better deal than CAT employees who pay for health care.
John Deer still builds parts in the USA? Who are the workers from across the border? Union stewards and higher up union bosses?
"For anyone bashing unions: I got my 25 yrs. in with the Teamsters. Without ANY representation, the boss CAN and will get rid of you at his whim! One time I had a delivery to the ""Wrigley Bldg"", I was polite and went to the security man on the street level who gave me a badge and said to go to the dock. I did and brought the material to the customer in good order. The ""security man"", there called my boss and said, I STOLE a badge as he did not check me in! I was called on the carpet when I got in like I robbed a bank. People have attitudes out there. Your UPS driver is on a schedule, I worked a Christmas hitch @ UPS and liked the professionalism, when Carter was Pres. but could not get back, as there was a recession, remember those years?"
UAW fails to properly explain to workers that buying and owning stock will allow workers to better experience profits (and losses and risks) than just working at a Deere plant.
"A union workers works at half speed, not very smart. they are legends in thier own mind and slow motion is thier moto."
Banks upOil uptech uponly CAT and DE down....whats the market theory? Why so much bearishness on these 2 stocks by the hedgies?
terrible corporation treating their workers like that
$126 to $340 in 2 years. This stock did nothing for years and then went on a tear. Its about time it corrected. Great company but it's still not a buy even at these levels.
"UAW fails to inform more than 10000 John Deere workers that 1) 401K plans have largely replaced pension plans across most industries, 2) a reversion to pension plans is just about as likely as a 30% raise and, 3) across the board zero deductible health plans are associated with increased absenteeism."
Chances are very high union votes no on contract Sunday ..
50 day moving average crossed the 200. Maybe it will get back to $400 in a few years. This is overpriced.
"Negotiators from the union returned to the bargaining table on Monday to thrash out a new deal, but have not reached a new agreement yet. A strike deadline of 23:59 CT on Wednesday (0459 on Thursday GMT) was set by the union."" If they walk the price drops and I will scoop up lots of cheap shares. Short-term pain for the company, but it seems horns are now locked!"
"Buy this stock! The quality of Deere equipment is in the toilet. The life expectancy of the company’s equipment is one third of just a few years ago and sales are still very high. Plastic had increasingly replaced steel. Faulty sensors have become common. Unreliable computers are used in every machine. However, the competition is even worse. 1) The current United States emission standard Tier 4 engines have one third life of Tier 3 engines of a few years ago. Planned obsolescence will ensure high future sales.2) All manufacturers face similar emission requirements and have produced equipment that performs as poorly or worse than Deere equipment. Our company is the best of a bad lot.3) Used equipment is being shipped overseas at record rates ensuring sales of new replacement equipment remain relatively high in the US which remains the most important market for Deere. 4) Engines that do not meet US emissions standards may not be sold domestically but may still be manufactured by Deere and sold overseas in countries that have fewer or no emission laws.5) Compared with former equipment the current generation has a fraction of the steel. This stuff is built light to save material cost and lower useful life. 6) Deere and the competition are in a race to the bottom. Deere is more financially capable than any of the competition to prosper. Expect a surge in John Deere sales. It’s not truly about pollution or sustainably. Its about making money."
"Tentative agreement made for the workers, should be bullish news!! No strike"
