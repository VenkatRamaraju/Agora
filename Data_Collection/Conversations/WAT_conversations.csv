"Given the coronavirus impact, WAT is likely to trade around $200-$215 in the near future, before its quarterly earning release.However, if Q1 2020 results were poor, then WAT can kiss $200 good bye."

"WAT has completed its $2.5 billion stock buyback program in 2019 (its biggest ever buy-back). Now, its Debt/EBITDA ratio is ~2.0. In 2020, even if WAT wants to buyback stock, it can probably only afford to buy back ~$500 million.WAT's earning has not been growing. Without the big buyback supporting its stock price, WAT is likely to fall below $200 / share in 2020."
No love for waters?
"Sell, sell now and ask questions later on...."
My guess is that WAT is due for a pullback in the short-run. the other week awesomeS-TOCKS alerted this company i think. google them .
Waters reached an all time high at 286.74
"WAT is attempting to make a big move up today. Probably some short squeeze. Significant resistance at $208 (50 day moving average). So, the stock is likely to be trading in the range of $180-$205 in the next 30 days."

This thing can easily go to 200+ ...soon.
So the CEO is voted out. What a disaster for a company already starved of new product and innovation. Competition will feast on this.

"US-China trade deal likely to be postponed, following Trump's signing of ""Hong Kong Democracy Bill"" on Thanksgiving eve. The deal delay might force Trump to raise tariff on China on Dec. 15... China is WAT's second-largest market (behind the US), so this is not a a good news for WAT..."

Will drop more before close!.....
Will there ever be a stock split in the future with Waters?
Waters is up 7.66% to 213.25
"Yesterday, WAT's 2020 guidance was below consensus. In particular, the revenue growth (a number, unlike ""adjusted earning"", is less subject to manipulation) is only 1%-3% (midpoint 2%). That is awful for a stock with high PE!WAT indeed bounced off its support to close @$219. The company still has ~$100 million / quarter of stock buyback plan in place to support its stock price, so I suspect WAT will hang around $220-$225 for a while."
Waters is down 4.93% to 187.03
"WAT is approaching $200/share again. In the current environment, $200 should be a pretty strong resistance level for WAT. My recommendation is to take the profits right now, wait on the sidelines, and wait for its upcoming quarterly earning results to decide whether to take a position (long or short) on this stock."
WAT is down -8.16% to 192.49
Waters reached a 52 Week high at 255.35
Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on WAT? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesomeS-TOCKS.
buyout coming!!!
way way way over sold.
WAT reached a new All Time High at 209.42
Glad I sold WAT at $254.20.......I thought the earnings were starting to git watered down
WAT has big exposure (18% of its revenue) in China. Not a good sign for its sales in 2019...
Waters reached a 52 Week low at 163.01
Buy and hold!
High % short on this one.
"10 messages, all spam. Yahoo has really messed up their boards."
"WAT is very exposed to Asia, as its sales in Asia is even larger than its sales in the US. This uses to be a ""good thing"", but in 2020, with China Pharma struggling, it is now a headwind."

"My take on WAT Q3 results:1) Big miss on sales: Very bad news. Even worse is that the geographically, the sales miss is due to weakness in the US, the home country. Instead, China/Asia held up relatively well. 2) Earning meet -- no big deal, every CFO has a few accounting tricks to manipulate earnings for a quarter or two... 3) Lowered FY outlook. Now WAT basically has NO Growth in 2019 (vs 2018)! That is horrible.Lastly, the company repurchased another $0.5 billion of its own shares in Q3. Given its latest balance sheet, the company's stock repurchase program, which provided significant support to its stock price, will be winding down significantly (probably to ~$150 million/quarter). That is another negative sign."

"Looks like WAT used some of its 2020's $100 million/quarter stock buyback money to support its stock in last couple of trading sessions. If we believe WAT does stock buyback @$190/sh, then $190 is likely a moderately-strong support in the short-term. Look for the stock to trade in the range of $190-$210 in much of March."

"WAT indeed plunged in the last few days. For traders, I would suggest that not to buy until WAT drops to $218 support level. Then, it might be worthwhile to do a trade to catch a short-term bounce. Nevertheless, this stock's overall trend is down."

"High-probability events: (my guess, based on historical experience, only time will tell).1) WAT will report a very poor Q2 earning. (The CFO will throw out all the hidden garbage on its financial book).2) WAT stock will therefore take a dive.3) New CEO will be announced4) During the transition period (O'Connell to the new CEO, which is the 2H of 2020), more poor results will be reported, as the new CEO will clear out all the garbage before he/she fully takes over.5) In Q1 2021, WAT stock hits its 12 month-low. Then, WAT will slowly move upwards, to benefit the new CEO (as his/her stock options are linked with the price gains in his/her era ONLY)."
"Wow. Trading below $190! Looks like WAT plans to ""kitchen-sink"" the Q1 2020 results, trying to find a bottom for its stock price, then build a base for the stock for the rest of the year."
A take over candidate?
expensive and no dividend. margin may be too big hence revenue is very low
