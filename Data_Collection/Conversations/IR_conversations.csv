"Mr. Buffet, take a look $ir, its quite possibly better than ketchup!Plug may not meet all of Mr. Buffets requirements. Plug may seem like the next big thing which is a temptation Mr. Buffet stays away from, but is Plug after 20 years and hydrogen as a newly proven commercial energy source just another ""next big thing"". No, its more it seems, and the inflection point seems like now. 1 billion dollars could go a long way at this juncture.https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/d-character-sitting-top-books-climbing-over-wall-stack-which-allow-him-to-climb-90064787.jpg""How unique are the products sold by the company?Buffett considers companies that produce products that can easily be substituted to be riskier than companies that provide more unique offerings. For example, an oil company’s product – oil – is not all that unique because clients can buy oil from any number of other competitors. However, if the company has access to a more desirable grade of oil – one that can be refined easily – then that might be an investment worth looking at.""Do you want to wait until the earnings are positive, or pu$h hydrogen and Plug over the top?If you invest in Plug, hydrogen will find its catalyst and the ITC and California will be quite bright.Like the trio with JP Morgan / Amazon / Berkshire = medicine disruptionThink of Plug / Amazon / Berkshire = energy disruption but mutually beneficial to solar as in hydrogen solar fuel.Why now ?30% ITC Tax IncentiveHydrogen Economy - new fuel base with super growth potential: Progen engine applications, H2 supplyCalifornia leading the push to H2 infrastructure - so goes the nationHouse hold name brand customers:Nike, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon, Mercedes, BMW, Carrefour, Lowes, P&G, Bridgestone, Coca Cola, CVS, Fedex, Honda, Kroger, Nestle, Sysco, Winco, etc."

Nice stock
"businesses will want retro fit HVAC systems to increase air flow to remove particles out of the air. Watch revenues surge next earnings call. Companies will start to advertise Clean Room Classification to show their business is safer.Ever been in a clean room, you can smoke a cigarette and the person next to you wouldn't be able to smell it."
I'm cashing in my profits here. Buying APPN cloud computing... beats earnings estimates and short squeeze coming. A quick pop-up $50+ easily today.
