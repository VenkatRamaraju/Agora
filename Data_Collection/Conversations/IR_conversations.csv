Wow! Hello SpamBot Sarah! Glad to see you.
40% of their pay in equity. That doesn't suck.
12 days & no news?? How can this be?
I use to own this stock back in the day before they were bought out. Was one of my favorite names and stock to own. I did very well but didn't even realize it was trading again until today. I wonder if it’s the same company. From what I read the last 2 years has not been going to well. Plus this stock is too tied to the price of oil. Always has. Anyone buying and how much upside do we have?
All you folks who thumbs downed my comment saying IR is a solid investment....30 plus percent higher since I said that. Suck it shorts.
how many believe that the ticker symbol for Ingersoll Rand Inc. is GDI ?

"Mr. Buffet, take a look $ir, its quite possibly better than ketchup!Plug may not meet all of Mr. Buffets requirements. Plug may seem like the next big thing which is a temptation Mr. Buffet stays away from, but is Plug after 20 years and hydrogen as a newly proven commercial energy source just another ""next big thing"". No, its more it seems, and the inflection point seems like now. 1 billion dollars could go a long way at this juncture.https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/d-character-sitting-top-books-climbing-over-wall-stack-which-allow-him-to-climb-90064787.jpg""How unique are the products sold by the company?Buffett considers companies that produce products that can easily be substituted to be riskier than companies that provide more unique offerings. For example, an oil company’s product – oil – is not all that unique because clients can buy oil from any number of other competitors. However, if the company has access to a more desirable grade of oil – one that can be refined easily – then that might be an investment worth looking at.""Do you want to wait until the earnings are positive, or pu$h hydrogen and Plug over the top?If you invest in Plug, hydrogen will find its catalyst and the ITC and California will be quite bright.Like the trio with JP Morgan / Amazon / Berkshire = medicine disruptionThink of Plug / Amazon / Berkshire = energy disruption but mutually beneficial to solar as in hydrogen solar fuel.Why now ?30% ITC Tax IncentiveHydrogen Economy - new fuel base with super growth potential: Progen engine applications, H2 supplyCalifornia leading the push to H2 infrastructure - so goes the nationHouse hold name brand customers:Nike, Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon, Mercedes, BMW, Carrefour, Lowes, P&G, Bridgestone, Coca Cola, CVS, Fedex, Honda, Kroger, Nestle, Sysco, Winco, etc."

I bought today. Like I said I use to own this stock back in the day before they were bought out. Same symbol too lol. I did very well with this stock. I think it represent good value here. But oil prices need to go up to see this stock move past $30 over the next 12 months.
