This thing is pricing like it is going bankrupt...$71B in revenue company..the prices on the these big integrated oil companies look like they are priced for armageddon
I heard about E the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It's looking like an interesting play.
"This is very interesting, Eni (E) is the biggest Italian oil company, bigger in market cap than any Canadian oil company. It is the exact size of the American EOG. This Eni stock (E) is going up every day, and yet there is zero, zero interest in this stock. It goes to show you that there are still lots of undiscovered gems in the market."
when did the divvy change? I saw 2.18 at other platforms
Best Italian stock real undervalue fair value price is 35/35.5$
Our debt is half of what most of the super majors have on their books we are in wonderful shape
"Facciamola facile, barile a 50$ Eni a 10,5 euro. Dividendo che vola a 0.6 dividend yield pazzesco e voi comprare la schifosa nikola. Che caz, guys!"

"I’m definitely bearish on this stock, renewable energy is the future, you should all know."
"when do they give up? Obviously, they can't sell their assets."
"Eni S.p.A. reported that it has been awarded two new exploration blocks in the eastern part of the sedimentary basin offshore Ivory Coast.The blocks, part of a group of 20 blocks that became available late last year, are located approximately 19 miles (30 kilometers) offshore and encompass a total area of approximately 352 square miles (911 square kilometers), Eni noted in a written statement emailed to Rigzone early Tuesday. The two new blocks include:Block CI-501: a 198-square-mile (512-square-kilometer) block approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Ivory Coast’s capital, Abidjan, at a water depth ranging from 328 to 7,874 feet (100 to 2,400 meters)Block CI-504: located roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of Abidjan, the 154-square-mile (399-square-kilometer) block is located in 3,281 to 7,710 feet (1,000 to 2,350 meters) of waterEni noted that it will operate both blocks and hold a 90-percent stake in each, with state-owned firm Petroci owning the remaining 10 percent. An identical ownership breakdown exists in Block CI-205, acreage that Eni already operates and adjacent to the north of the two new blocks."

"Overlooked stock, perhaps US investors don't know about Eni (I'm from Europe)Perhaps no overwhelming potential for the share price, but should give stable dividends. Well managed company.ENI is also a good diversification if you otherwise mostly hold leveraged companies (money won't be free forever...)"
E reached a new 52 Week High at 35.32
"You dear shareholders will love the spin off Eni Gas e Luce Renewables, yeah it’s coming and with it more buyback more debt cut or extraordinary dividend. Pay attention  Eni is the cash cow   "

"No interest in E... that's good, small investor moths are always attracted to the bugzapper stocks ;)"
