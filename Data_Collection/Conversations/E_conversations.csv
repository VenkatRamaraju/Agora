"This is very interesting, Eni (E) is the biggest Italian oil company, bigger in market cap than any Canadian oil company. It is the exact size of the American EOG. This Eni stock (E) is going up every day, and yet there is zero, zero interest in this stock. It goes to show you that there are still lots of undiscovered gems in the market."
Eni is up 10.31% to 16.38
E reached a new 52 Week Low at $31.80
"when do they give up? Obviously, they can't sell their assets."
"Overlooked stock, perhaps US investors don't know about Eni (I'm from Europe)Perhaps no overwhelming potential for the share price, but should give stable dividends. Well managed company.ENI is also a good diversification if you otherwise mostly hold leveraged companies (money won't be free forever...)"

"Have watched this company for several months, bought some shares yesterday. Looks like it is down some more today. The main reason I bought into E, I think they are well positioned in the global market to be suppliers of NG, LNG and chemicals. I believe that NG and LNG will increase in use and the price will increase to where it will be profitable for companies with the infrastructure in place to grow. I know that their income is down at the present time, so is all the oil and gas companies, large and small. Just my thoughts, anyone care to comment on this company?"

The two new blocks include:Block CI-501: a 198-square-mile (512-square-kilometer) block approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Ivory Coast’s capital, Abidjan, at a water depth ranging from 328 to 7,874 feet (100 to 2,400 meters)Block CI-504: located roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of Abidjan, the 154-square-mile (399-square-kilometer) block is located in 3,281 to 7,710 feet (1,000 to 2,350 meters) of waterEni noted that it will operate both blocks and hold a 90-percent stake in each, with state-owned firm Petroci owning the remaining 10 percent. An identical ownership breakdown exists in Block CI-205, acreage that Eni already operates and adjacent to the north of the two new blocks."
