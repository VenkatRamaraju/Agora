"Eni S.p.A. reported that it has been awarded two new exploration blocks in the eastern part of the sedimentary basin offshore Ivory Coast.The blocks, part of a group of 20 blocks that became available late last year, are located approximately 19 miles (30 kilometers) offshore and encompass a total area of approximately 352 square miles (911 square kilometers), Eni noted in a written statement emailed to Rigzone early Tuesday. The two new blocks include:Block CI-501: a 198-square-mile (512-square-kilometer) block approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Ivory Coast’s capital, Abidjan, at a water depth ranging from 328 to 7,874 feet (100 to 2,400 meters)Block CI-504: located roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of Abidjan, the 154-square-mile (399-square-kilometer) block is located in 3,281 to 7,710 feet (1,000 to 2,350 meters) of waterEni noted that it will operate both blocks and hold a 90-percent stake in each, with state-owned firm Petroci owning the remaining 10 percent. An identical ownership breakdown exists in Block CI-205, acreage that Eni already operates and adjacent to the north of the two new blocks."

"Have watched this company for several months, bought some shares yesterday. Looks like it is down some more today. The main reason I bought into E, I think they are well positioned in the global market to be suppliers of NG, LNG and chemicals. I believe that NG and LNG will increase in use and the price will increase to where it will be profitable for companies with the infrastructure in place to grow. I know that their income is down at the present time, so is all the oil and gas companies, large and small. Just my thoughts, anyone care to comment on this company?"

"Disney+NetFLIX Partnership ""MAKE$ SEN$E""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--Netflix is already a great friend of Disney, in fact, Iger has repeatedly acknowledged how they are in part responsible for Netflix’s success. Disney continues to sell more and more content to Netflix spanning movies and television series, while at the same time struggling to get their own direct-to-consumer content business off-the-ground in the UK.While we have been quite skeptical that ESPN can go direct-to-consumer, if ESPN were bundled in with Netflix — it would give Netflix the one form of content it does not have in its march to replace linear TV — “live sports.” Combining Disney and Netflix effectively recreates the best of the legacy video bundle, removes the distributor, packaging together great content with best-in-class technology spanning all devices consumers love to use. But the really exciting aspect for Disney, would be to bring in a visionary CEO, who understands the future of content and video programming in Reed Hastings. For Netflix, they get permanent access to the content creation of the world’s most prolific studio."

"This is very interesting, Eni (E) is the biggest Italian oil company, bigger in market cap than any Canadian oil company. It is the exact size of the American EOG. This Eni stock (E) is going up every day, and yet there is zero, zero interest in this stock. It goes to show you that there are still lots of undiscovered gems in the market."
"Facciamola facile, barile a 50$ Eni a 10,5 euro. Dividendo che vola a 0.6 dividend yield pazzesco e voi comprare la schifosa nikola. Che caz, guys!"
"From The First Press Release : "" To our knowledge, two companies have first-to-file status and may be in a position to launch on November 1, 2016, although we cannot be certain of that date. Our intent is to launch these strengths after FDA final approval following expiry of the other companies’ exclusivity period(s)."" So 2 More Advanced Bigger Competitors Already Have Exclusive Rights On This Drug !!!! That Means IPCI Can't Even Start Selling Their Versions Until Way Into 2018 At THE VERY BEST If The FDA Even Gives Them Final Approval !!!! How Many More Competitors Will Already Be There With Approvals ALREADY BY THEN ? Hello ? Truth / Facts Are Making These Press Releases Sound Not Very Meaningful !!!! Look At What Happened To The 2 Focalin Doses With PAR / ENDO For A Clue As To How This Will Go Down !!!! THAT Was With Exclusive Rights On Those Focalin Doses TOO !!!! How Much Money Have They LO$T Since They Got Approval ? Its A HUGE Amount Of LO$$E$ !!!! Look At Revenues For Next Quarter Its Worse Than Last Year !!!! They Don't Have Anything To Sell Except The 2 Focalin Doses Which They Cannot SELL For A Profit !!!! This Is A CA$H INCINERATOR Company !!!!"

"Overlooked stock, perhaps US investors don't know about Eni (I'm from Europe)Perhaps no overwhelming potential for the share price, but should give stable dividends. Well managed company.ENI is also a good diversification if you otherwise mostly hold leveraged companies (money won't be free forever...)"

"YHOO Email Held Hostage-Ransom/""554 Error Message""Email Held Hostage By YHOO-Ransom Demand: Anyone else have their email account flagged for ""554"" error, only to find they continue to receive email, they simply cannot reply, or send, email from their Yahoo account?I've noticed more and more Spam coming in, so I've changed my passwords, as recommended, only to find any email I tried sending on Labor Day was bounced back with some generic message about suspicious activity found on my account, then have NO WAY IN HELL to find a solution to the problem on their worthless webpage.I've noticed a lot of other users expressing frustration with the same problem, and no one seems to have found a solution, other than waiting for Yahoo Help to get their heads out of their a$$e$ and push the magic button to reactivate the account.Yesterday, Labor Day, I called Yahoo Help to address the issue, then was transferred over to their ""Network"" specialist to try and resolve the problem. The network specialist, John, went on the longest sales pitch to tell me, and showed me when he gained access to my computer remotely, how my IP address had been hacked by some geniuses in Nigeria and some other 3rd world, God-forsaken location, were active on my network and were the ones using my Yahoo email address.The information was informative, but John kept pressing the issue how I ""needed"" to protect my network before Yahoo will reactivate my email account. He went on to tell me I ""needed"" to subscribe to 1 of 3 services that provide an ""IP Blocker,"" which will prevent the 3rd world'ers from gaining access to my network again. The ""BEST"" deal tossed to me was a ""Lifetime"" protection plan by AAKA for $500. WTF??? I may have been born at night, but it sure as hell wasn't last night, so I told ""John"" I had a real estate appointment I had to keep in 10 minutes and would call back to ""explore"" the AAKA proposal.John wanted nothing to do with waiting, and told me he could install the program while I was away. I told him I wasn't comfortable leaving my computer open with him having access while I was gone, then proceeded to close our conversation, when I noticed John trying like hell to interfere with my keystrokes to close our connection. John actually tried accessing my HKEY command from the ""Run"" prompt, whereby I immediately hit ALT, CTRL, DEL to cancel John from pulling anymore stunts with my PC.My daughter-in-law is an expert in computers and contacted her immediately after the conversation with Yahoo and was told emphatically NO that I did NOT need to at $500 for IP blocker and the whole sales pitch was a SCAM.I called Yahoo back a little later, told them about my ""554"" problem, and was immediately told I needed to speak with ""John"" again. Spare me, Jesus!!!!I told John about my daughter-in-law's comment, and was then told Yahoo could reactivate my email account for a $100 ""technician"" fee. GFY, John, AND YAHOO!!!!!!!I've watched the absolute deterioration and destruction of Yahoo over the years and can't wait for Verizon to drop the axe on this worthless group of green cards, send them back wherever the hell they came from, and will transfer all of my email to Gmail.Those poor, incompetent CSR's at Yahoo must be really trying to destroy what's left of this pathetic POS.GFY and KMA YHOO"

"The science will win in the end. I'm really excited at the prospects for these patients. I have a neighbor that is in his 80's with a severe case of Parkinsons. It's turned into high degree dementia. He walks all over the place with no real destination except he thinks he's going home. I have another one just 3 doors down, 49 yrs old with beginning stages. It's a crippling disease with no discrimination. Shorts can bash all you want. This is the first time there's something real and our Gov't finally got off their A$$E$ and passed a bill that will help us. BIIB isn't testing the compound cause it's fun to do. I think this thing ends up in a bidding war before phase 3 starts"
