Wth is happening? I don’t own this stock but why is it going down this much?
Thank you for the shares. 2160 shares around $107. In the red for now but just a matter of time.
Check out the SEC filing. Lots of insiders buying at $206. You know what's up!

Read this Report and yes I agree 100%https://moxreports.com/dillards-upside-perfect-storm/
"I can’t believe this didn’t get squeezed, or the data on the short interest and float are inaccurate"
$60 in few minutes
Retail spending rose in August. I can definitely see the Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2...
2021 is probably going to be a record year for Dillard’s.
Market got knocked down. DDS is consolidating after a well over 150% rise from its May 14th low of $21.5. Still a significant upside remains. This is why the big boys are betting on it not for the short term price swing. I am long on this.
"Remeber JCP used trade at $70, now $1"
Highlights of the Fourth Quarter 2020: Very encouraging:Earnings per share of $3.05 per share compared to net income of $2.75 per shareNet income of $67.0 million compared to net income of $67.7 million for the prior year fourth quarterRetail gross margin improved 171 basis points of salesInventory decreased approximately 26%Operating expenses decreased $122.8 millionEnding cash of $360 million with no outstanding borrowings under the Company's $800 million revolving credit facilitySequential improvement in comparable store sales which decreased approximately 17% in the 4th quarter following a 24% decrease in the third quarter
"Just for all to know, historically Q1 and Q3 always reports the weak number. Q2 and Q4 always post strong numbers. So if Dillard’s can post 7.25/share in Q1, It will be higher for Q2 and rest of year. I’m a strong believer that it will hit 200s after Q2 earning and 300s by year end."
"Just another stock day. Just wait till Q2 earnings get released, that’s when 200s will happen."

"Summary of retailer bonds, which is a tell for the equity:- Macy's bonds are rated BBB-. The 2027 maturity with 6.8% coupon is trading at 73.- JWN bonds are rated BBB+.

The bond market is the one that matters for the equity, longer term."
DDS drops 10%. what is happening?
"A lot to digest in this report. Obviously a new culture of surviving and thriving by controlling cost is taking hold. This is great for the company on its longterm journey. Also significantly lowered short term debt eases pressure and strengthens liquidity. Also great was the share repurchase at an average cost of $32.5 Per share (already showing over $9mill profit on those 600k shares). Management clearly believes shares are undervalued. With the kind of insight they have on company direction, who could argue on this buy backs. I would not be surprised if shares double from here."
Back to $75
"Again I’m not fazed by ups and downs. I’m an investor. Y’all just make noises for no backings . Also in SEC, Dillard’s are buying up shares...."
I am vacation and funny enough I went to Dillard’s in Ft. Lauderdale store Just to see how it is operating. I’m telling you guys it was packed! Q2 is going to be crazy good! This is a comeback year for department stores!
I think the big money is starting to flow out of DDS and will continue to do so over the next few months. A year ago is when it started to flow in so makes sense to lock in the massive gains at long term capital gains rates as they time in. The investment thesis and risk/reward doesn’t make sense at this level. Better places to put money to work.
What happened today causing a $10 drop in share pricing?
"Give me a break. a .15 cent dividend. Then buy 500 million shares back, If they can buy them back. That just means they want to buy them back. And when a company pays out a crapy 15 cents and says its going to buy back 500 million shares instead of paying the share holders, that tells me they will pay their CO,EXO, and their family out the shares in bonuses. Check out who owns most of the stock and who their officers are. Get with it. A 15 cent dividend for a 125.35 a share stock. I gave you BX, KMI, Tons of others for way less money and way better returns on your investment."
its gonna jump. big time. just watch. They own all of their stores they have clearance stores. they have 350 million dollars in cash. almost 3/4 of a billion dollar credit line. they have over 5 billion in real estats. they've been selling like crazy on line during covid. they pay dividends. They own the company that builds their stores.. Load the truck up..
I got family that runs a store. Dillards has there %$#& together. but take some profit. got out round 35. congrats longs. awesome
"So, where does Dillard's inventory come from?"
I just thought you all might want to hear that Dillards is closing a minimum of 200 stores by this years end. I am not a share holder or a shorter. I have no puts or calls on this company. At $183.27 last Fridays close. I did not look at the after hours price. What is your opinion on this company. I will watch it Monday 8/2/2021.Looking for advice on this.
DDS is going to have to make a big move if we’re going to 350 by the end of Q3!!
"Short squeeze of the century right here. Almost $300 million of cash, basically an untapped $800 million credit facility. It will take 16 days for the shorts to cover. This stock is a coiled spring getting ready to skyrocket."

"The short sellers are using lot sell tech with intentionally decreased each small lot of share price to drive down the share price in the open market. It is legal but folks don't get fooled by their trading technique. Let us load it up! With 90% floating are being shorted, it takes time to cover their positions. Let us buy the shares"
Bought another 15 Aug20 $160 contracts earlier today. If anything this is a good hedge for my long bets. If the overall market corrects DDS drops much further by %.Mostly I feel SP drops considerably after ER.
Seasoned managers not able or capable of using their complicated systems a sure sign that systems is antiquated.
the big boys are scaring you so retailer don't think of making this or any other shorted stock into gme. but they won't succeed. load more when they short more...
A lovely raise in price but this is still undervalued. We will get used to seeing 3 digits In share’s price in this company.
Companies starting to send people (professional people) home to work at home . Not good for  brick and mortar.
"Their careers website says they offer a retirement plan. There are many hard working people who have dedicated the majority of their lives to this company, and will lose the retirement plans/pensions they were no doubt planning on if the company goes down. Hedge funds shorting this only see the dollars they'll put in their pockets when they drive it into the ground. I'm buying more of the stock."
7 weeks ago and you can go check on this board I said dillard will jump big time get ready. so here you go...

"DILLARDS is the second most shorted stock, should we buy it? Also it is shortet by melvin capital"
"I hate doing this but I am going to go against the shorts here :) Bought 180 shares prior to close. 80% of the float was bought over the past 3 trading days. Once the last 1-2MM shares are traded, this should fly like GME with 90% of the float shorted. The extremely low float (5.5MM shares) and the current stock market environment should help this to rise even faster than GME. Not that it matters much, but their revenues are about the same, DDS will show a profit next year (unlike GME) and GME has a market cap of 8 x DDS as of right now. Will probably add more tomorrow before the real lift off starts..."
"So many negative comment it's unbelievable. Makes me think there is a group intentionally making what has been a successful effort to pull pull this stock down. Dillards is well positioned, comparatively lower debt and ownership of assets to whether the COVID-19 storm. This stock is a bargain at the current price. Has been stagnant due to shorts and in my view to this negative board. Who would want to invest with all of these negative comments. People remember why you invested in the stock in the first place. Longs we will prevail!"
"as long as shorts not covering, I am not giving up.... I averaged down from 95 to 90.."
"JWN had more stores stay closed for longer, because so many are in California. I’m guessing that created a lag with the stock price. Will $JWN catchup to $DDS?"
Stock constantly goes up because it’s constantly shorted. Can we get JWN to do this?
not sure who you think will be selling this...einhorn just bought a large stake he's not selling and insiders aren't selling and there is a big buyback..and a big short....I woulndt want to be short here
"they have 350 million in cash, 850 million line of crediit. over 5 billion in real estate, own the construction company that builds their stores, has clearance stores just like tjx and was selling out of stores through a online sale the entire time we were on lockdown. er should be interesting. its undervalued because its not sexy but they definitely are not jcpenneys."
"Just announced .15 dividend and all stores to open this week. Took all write offs last quarter and people want to shop , let’s hope things get back to normal and market realizes how cheap this stock is!"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
For all of you desperate long holders that keep insinuating that a short-squeeze is imminent take a look at $DDS this is a modern day squeeze for sure. Driven by an upgrade and stock buyback programs - wow and to think I almost layered a short position yesterday.
"Earnings Strength is VERY NEGATIVEFord's earnings momentum measures the acceleration or deceleration in trailing 12 monthoperating earnings per share growth. The downward curvature of the plotted points in the graphon the right indicates that while Dillard's Inc.'s earnings have increased from $-4.73 to anestimated $20.04 over the past 5 quarters, they have shown strong deceleration in quarterlygrowth rates when adjusted for the volatility of earnings. This is an indication of weakness thatcould lead to declining earnings."
Since it hit 180ish I have been posting to these kids here sell sell sell buy something actually worth it. This will be $100 the fair market value by end of year. Keep making money for the owners by holding!
DDS has such low float and it will be lower through stock repurchase plan. Honestly I wouldn’t be shocked it breaks over 300 this year.
After hours buying stock manipulation nice round figure 
"My analysis estimate for DDS EPS in Q2 Low $4.30 High 9.10 EPS Mid 7.20If it’s low, it will shoot to low 200sIf it’s mid, it will shoot to 250-260sIf it’s high, it will shoot just below 300"
"I noticed this morning Zacks went from a 3 to a 5. No need stopping by 4, I guess.https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/DDS?q=DDS"
8.81/share EPS!!!!!! Holy Moley!!!!!! I knew it!!!! This baby will fly!!!!!
"$DDS short int is $548mm; 9.20mm shs shorted; 99.46% of float; 25.10% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +617k, +7%, over the last month as its stock price rose +8% & up +183k, +2%, over the last week. Shorts are down -$13.1 mm in Sept mark-to-market losses,down -$36.9mm year-to-date"
"What are these shorts waiting for? with the holiday season upon us and vaccines around the corner.. not to mention the continuing shrinking of the float.. again, for the life of me I don't understand the rationale!"
"My question from Twitter Land I'll post here, too:$JWN (Nordstom's) 52-week low during lock down of $12.24...Today hit $12.74 again. $DDS (Dillard's) low of $21.5 and is now $31.5$M (Macy's) low of $4.38 & is now $6.35$TJX (Tj Max) $32.72 low & now $53.88$ROST (Ross) $56.3 low & now $90.62What retail is on sale?"
DDS best positioned retailer. Solid balance sheet with at least $40 share in tangible assets. Many of their stores in suburban locations little affected by covid. All are back open I believe. Great opportunity to buy this stock trading at the same discount as their airlines and cruise lines. Unreal.
Dropped it $15 on a few 100K shares? Shorts trying to make hay while GME and AMC come back to earth by shorting even more - possibly naked shorting. DDS is the next ticking timebomb for them and they very well know it.
Look at that tiny volume. The float is almost locked. What happens when there is no supply for the momo crowd who want to buy for the ride and for the hedgies who want to start covering next week? The manipulation to shake out the weak was done from the fall from $127 to $80 over the past 2 days. Not many sold - in fact more shares were probably bought and locked away. This should be glorious! I see DDS passing GME's high mark in the next 2-3 weeks. Patience is all that is needed...
"So I shorted yesterday, not the best trade I've ever made."
Bahahah everyday red till it goes down to $100 which is what it’s worth. Do your research pay for the premium on your horrible gambling Robinhood app kids and you still understand a thing or 2. Thanks for the money!!
Company will have all stores open next week and appears to have a game plan for future sales. Stock had the worst possible earnings already priced in it. Those shorts should be covering tomorrow and Dillard’s is financially solid
"with the vast improvement in margins, big players entering the space, and a significant short interest, this stock could go to $100+/share. this happened previously under a similar scenario back in 1Q of 2015 when the stock reached $135/share."
I've seen this dance before. It goes up and down then BOOM it soars up 50-70% in next few days. I look forward to that day :)
"Instead of messing with stocks that have already shot to the moon and returned back to earth (somewhat) like $GME and $AMC, why not the ""legion of boom"" target the next moonshot like $DDS and $LGND with over 100% of the float shorted and still on the launch pad? Interesting dynamics.."
"Company bought 600k shares at an average price of $32.5. It said it will continue buying as it believes it is worth much more and making float smaller by the day. Unless general market conditions deteriorate and we enter bear market, very risky to short this stock. There other justified short candidates on the market. This still has a lot of upside potential left in it. Remember, this is holiday season and they will have sold a bit to increase liquidity and profitability. Though they still have a lot of room to improve on their online traffic, it has been a pleasant outlet for access to the market. It does not hurt having owned a bulk of their operation locations as well."
"Why I sold Dillard's stockAs speculative, heavily shorted stocks surged in recent weeks, I sold some of my investments long before I had planned to do so. Less than two months ago, I flagged Dillard's as a stock that could be primed to soar in 2021.At the time, Dillard's stock traded for less than $50. Earlier this week, the stock blew past $100, reaching a multiyear high before surrendering some of its gains. Importantly, Dillard's hasn't released any newsworthy information during this period. The stock doubled purely due to speculation and a short squeeze.DDS ChartDILLARD'S STOCK PERFORMANCE, DATA BY YCHARTS.Dillard's stock remains heavily shorted, which could pave the way for further share-price gains in the weeks ahead. But any such gains would likely prove ephemeral. Dillard's faces plenty of headwinds in its core department-store business. Moreover, after the recent surge in its stock price, the company's real estate value no longer provides much downside protection. With the risk-reward balance worsening, I sold all of my Dillard's shares on Tuesday."
I will definitely short this Monday... free money
Congrats longs
Don't yell my wife but I have accumulated 48k shares over the last four weeks with 8k of those today. A bit risky? Yep. Can I afford the stick to drop a point or two and then panic sell? Yep. Do I feel that will jasper? Nope.I have two other investments with similar $ amounts invested. $AMC and $DDS Put contracts expiring at various dates beginning in September.The rest of my investments are blue chip.Thoughts?
Can someone explain in laymens terms what is going on? I bought shares months ago @$ 24.50. It's been a crazy ride but I have no clue what it all means.
"Dillard's is like an old classic car that's been restored on the outside, but the inside is still old and outdated especially when it comes to executive management. They need to revaluate moving forward."
"waiting on the company buy back announcement. as of February 20, had purchase 500,000 at $68 and still had $256 million authorized left to purchase. could easily buy back 5 million shares. there is a 6 million shares short and company employees own 7.2 million shares out of 19 million in total. BUY this company, it's a pure real estate play. Each store cost $20 million to build."
Somebody made a lot of money in DDS. Did Berkshire buy DDS at some point?I am long DDT 15 years or more. Do not own DDS.
Just shaking off weak hands. Insiders bought this in at 185 and 206. DDS got excellent earnings better than M and JWN.
"Announced today. Dillard's will get a completely new store in Midland Park Mall, Midland TX. In an announcement from Simon Properties of an addition of 2 more restaurants on the Mall pad areas and another national full format retailer not previously in Midland Tx. For those not paying attention to the Permian Basin, you should. Permian Basin is THE major oil producing area in the United States. Growth in all sectors of the Permian Basin economy continues at a rapid pace. Having Dillard's participation in this growth underscores the growth. I challenge everyone to follow the Permian Basin and be involved in this very exciting period."
"LGND this says it all. Short % of Float (Dec 31, 2020) 106.50%Still hasn't moved much. Get in on the bottom before the big move up."
Strong balance sheet. Owns 95% of its real estate. State-of-the-art inventory systems. Family-control enables strict control of costs. Finally penetrating the on-line space. What's not to like? Last time around short-interest drove the stock to $130+ a share. Could easily happen again with good news for quarters 3 & 4.
"All you need to know to make a fortune here:---------------------------------------------------Float 5.55M% Held by Insiders 26.28% % Held by Institutions 94.73%Shares Short (Dec 31, 2020) 4.44MShort % of Float (Dec 31, 2020) 104.85%"
"Company owns most of its stores. As far as valuation is concerned, not only their main bread and butter of retail is at play but a strong and a much appreciated real estate as well. With the vaccine now reaching to the arms of Americans, I would not be shorting this equity. You may add to that the effects of millions of shares repurchased and increased liquidity due to cost saving and holiday shopping activity this past quarter. It will definitely reach triple digits soon in my opinion. Many over valued short candidates out there if you would like."
"So how long can this stock defy its fundamentals? Eventually it will join the department store waste basket and sell for a 9 or 10 PE on forward earnings. This year's estimate is $3.50. Can anyone say $35 price. Short covering will keep it up for a while, but eventually it will crack."
"I don't own DDS but MG dead money really? The company made nearly three dollars a share in the first quarter of the year, a time that is traditionally retail's weakest quarter, I think that is far from being dead."
"Rating: 2.6> CEO approval rating: 37%> Employees: 40,000> Industry: Department storesFounded in 1938 by William T. Dillard, Dillard’s department store chain has nearly 300 locations across 29 states. Despite going public in 1969, Dillard’s is still something of a family business. Currently, four of CEO Bill Dillard II’s siblings work as company executive officers, and William Dillard III, the CEO’s son, is a senior vice president.While the Dillard family may be happy with their jobs, the typical Dillard’s employee is not. With a 2.6 job satisfaction rating on Glassdoor, for the fifth consecutive year, Dillard’s ranks among the worst companies to work for. Dissatisfied workers frequently cite unrealistic sales quotas and poor management practices. Not only is employee morale suffering at Dillard’s, but it seems business is as well. In keeping with a nationwide trend among department stores, profits are down. The company posted net income of $269.4 million in its fiscal 2015, down from $331.9 million the previous year."
I cannot believe what I'm seeing. It just keeps dropping and dropping.
"My prediction, it go up and down based on market’s roller coaster but at end it will continue upwards to 150-160 in next month or so. Once the Q2 earnings come out, it’ll explode upwards to breaking 200s."
"Very Pleased with DDS. I bought it last year and sold it for a great gain. Too early but still pleased. I see it trading up here, and I am baffled. It usually trades at a much lower PE, and if you check the 10 or even 20 year chart this is the nosebleed price. They really are not growing with any significance . No major store builds in the pipeline. The earnings growth is simply a post Covid event. I think it may be a nice short here. Maybe a blowoff top today. Closed down $16 from the high. I have not shorted yet, but thinking about it."
This  will be back to $100 by end of year
Someone’s short position was margin called over at GameStop. Dillard’s and other high short interest stocks all popped around the same time. What madness
"Propped up on shaky stilts, amazed at how long it can keep its balance. These institutions sure do have some interesting tactics."
its hilarious because it pops out of nowhere. Once the short margins start you see it go to 120 and so now is the time to get in and buy buy buy. I can see a short squeeze coming here.
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373555-buy-dillards-stock-not-for-core-business
What's up with DDS today- dropping on heavy volume? Perhaps manipulation by desperate shorts?
Here we go! Bought yesterday early and sat through some pain. Was just early. Let’s Go
"Why is DDT still languishing at $16? The company bought stock back in the first quarter, and they just announced they will pay the dividend on the common stock. I already own way too much DDT but I added more this morning. The company has never missed a quarterly interest payment since inception, and the interest must be accrued if not paid. Now that they are paying the dividend on the common, they have to pay the interest on DDT. What am I missing here?"
Dillard’s is perfect for Walmart. Both are Arkansas companies and Walmart will have upscale retail with real estate for not too much dollars.
Shorts roasted. Lesson is when you have money do try to invest in / help small companies that bring a bright future to you and to our society by helping a dream (or new product) come true.
Sounds Like shorts really took a lose on this stock.
Check out Macy‘s with better than expected numbers today. Huge catch-up potential.
And there it is again 186 after hours manipulation
will be marvelous when the bottom falls out of this
Very cheap with $31 earnings !!
"Hey Shorty! The only money that is drying up is your investment portfolio. Before you make another irrational investment, research the top brass at Dillards and compare to the rest of the industry."
I have been bullish with this company for over a year and it paid off. I still think that it has a strong performance to keep going go. Still holding.
"Well, it looks I called that wrong. I'll lick my wounds and sell the Puts at the best opportunity IMO before 9/17. Some investment calls work out while others don't. That's investing."
"But in all seriousness, which short should I add to: $AMC or $DDS?Serious qiestion."
"The Article of Story is written by,Audrey Kyanova, at Yahoo. This is what she wrote. Dillards is closing down 200 stores. The department store woes as Chain Store Age called it, have a lot of factors behind them. Though retailers like to blame online shopping, that isn't the whole answer. Rising Rents, delayed effort from the recession, changes in spending habits and over-expansion are also the culprits.Retail Dive stated that another possible reason for the Demise of Dillards was the downside of tradition.Dillards attracted a more traditional clientele, and younger consumers under the age or 40 often didn't find anything for them there. As younger consumers are a large part of the retail market, Dillards failure to include them hurt the company. This is the source and the article I read on Sunday August 1st, 2021. Look it up."
I can't hold much longer. It traded at 65 range for years. They are profiting about the same now that everything has opened up. Not sure why it is being valued so much higher than $65. I will hold for 1 more day hoping for 1 more pop. It has far surpassed where I thought I would sell. Good Luck.
"This was expected,but thought it would come sooner. The money is drying up stores panicking doing unplanned additional sales. Dillard's down the highest percentage wise amongst it's competitors for today."
"Facts: 1) DDS is currently grossly overvalued and will fall back <= 100/share 2) DDS real estate is not desirable and not worth that much, it is located in low grade locations 2) DDS operates a low margin business where revenues will continue to decrease as ecommerce chips away at market share and they continue to close stores 3) purported DDS insider buying has actually been options grants designed to enrich (greedy) DDS execs 4) as reality settles in more DDS insiders will start to sell, just like James Freeman (former CFO and board member) sold 60K shares in late May 5) institutions will continue to sell, just like Newport Trust sold 620K shares in March...next round of 13Fs available in Aug will be interesting indeed."
"Dillards has the luxury of last man standing environment. Many big box retailers have disappeared. People for the most part want to touch, feel and try on clothes to get the right fit before buying. Amazon drives people crazy with all that shipping back and forth. Dillards has a clear growth path for 3-5 years."
Why is the bid price $28 below the stock price? That’s a huge drop.
Ouch 
I do not have any pity in these funds who pump and suck retail investors and dump the same.Same day they go long and short by sucking blood of innocent peopleThey have to get punished and these SEC guys are joke. If retailers trade with honesty and integrity they will not tolerate.The Big boys can do the same without any problemWatch how many stocks will have short squeeze and these funds go Bk soon$AMC $GME $BB $BBBY $DDS $KOSS $EXPR$NOK
Can anyone please explain to me why this stock has doubled over the past two weeks?
Healthy pullback after amazing rally yesterday. Expecting another small pullback before it springs over 200 after the earnings! Let’s go Dillard’s!
Not selling till it hits $400.
Dillard’s bought up lot of shares recently a week before the earnings get released....sounds like they know what’s up....better cover your shorts soon....
"9 straight days of upward movement. Can I say momentum here. With share repurchase and improved sales since the pandemic along with a foothold in online traffic, the upward movement is to continue given a healthy underlying market Condition."
DDS is down -5.94% to 68.67
sold all my positions in $DDS They have stores closing in Iowa not looking good for them even if things do recover
Earnings out before the opening tomorrow.A beat and there should be some panic shorts.
"Charles Schawb upgraded their stock grade on DDS to A from B, performing better than 91% of the competition compared to only 82% last week.Zacks upgraded the stock from 3-Hold to 1-Strong Buy and has listed the department as the #1 retailer in the US.Barchart has increased the short-term bullish strength of DDS to 100%, the maximum possible.Tipranks has upgraded the stock from 3-Underperform to 6-Neutral. Even a small upgrade is better than a downgrade.This stock sounds like a real winner."
"Dillard has all of the characteristics of a potential short squeeze The current short interest as at Jan 31 was 7,511,400 which represents an amazingly high 70% of the float. It also equals 14 days of the average trading volume. Earnings are due Feb, 27 with consensus of $1.77 up from $1.64 30 days prior and $1.56 60 days prior. Expect a beat with 2 analysts at $2.00.It looks like the action has started to-day."
"If everything is so great at the company, why does the director sell his shares for a week?)"
It is something to take notes that Yahoo Finance are saying that DDS is at a fair value. I've scanned through hundreds of companies and Yahoo always says overvalue on them. It's a rare sighting and do you know what that means? It means it will continue to be the bull for couple years!
How does this stock go up over 5% every week  I was in around $30 and I cannot fathom how this is still going up
Seen this song and dance before. People crowding in to buy and shorts getting nervous. Not a pressure cooker yet but will pop off to $230-240 by friday. Making money with DDS is like shooting fish in a barrel.
Wonder how much longer I will be talking to myself. Holding 3520 shares now. Target $500. If management announces a 5:1 forward split and raises money to pay off their remaining debt - we will go much higher.
"my source is Yahoo Finance if you look at it today its posted along with Lowes, J.C. Penny and a number of others that are having store closers. Follow down on the finance page and its the first listing along with a list of others that are closing some of their stores.This company DDS was the first and the most closings on the list"
"Charles, read financial statements. Not articles. That’s how you make investments."
"Anyone working in a reopened dillards?If so, Please, if you can, let us know how sales are compared to last year.I have to believe that dds has a larger percent of their locations open than M, KSS, JCP, or JWN.I'm sure that sales are down from last year but what is more important is the sales trend since reopening. any info would be helpful. Thanks in advance.Long at 24.5The whole sector moved today, I attribute the move based upon M able to raise 1.1 billion (secured) in a tough market. They haven't released the final pricing or interest rate but I assume the offering went well and the stock rallied all day long pulling the rest of the sector along with it.The fact that they could raise 1.1 billion from 35 box locations and 3 standalone locations and their distribution centers should give a good indication what DDS Real Estate would be worth in the current market. M secured refinancing was at 50% of the appraised value, the same discount from appraised value was given for the secured loans/bonds that JCP did about 7 years ago.DDS has about 43mm sq ft of owned real estate. The land alone without the stores should be worth about $40.00 a share. The stock is nearly as cheap now at $30 as it was back in 08-09 when it was $5.00.Only 1/3 the shares outstanding and debt a few hundred million lower.Good Luck"
DDS balance sheet is the most sound among all the retailers.
"Lmfao, it’s a game. It’ll bounce back."
Below average volume again let the sell off continue.
Daddy running out of money 
Technically 154 is very important. If it holds or fails we could see a significant break either way.
"DDS is planning to announce new store closures and a strategic shift to online, abandoning some markets. I buyback is over. was a coordinated short squeeze. Back to $25 or low $20s now"
"Shorts are desperately trying to keep this under wraps so that alerts don't get activated in the WSB/reddit community. Look at the shorting volume over the past few days (Source: Fintel) although over 100% of the float was already short on Dec 15. Delicious metrics....------------------------------------------------------------Market Date Short Volume Total Volume Short Volume Ratio2021-01-29 186,675 844,300 22.112021-01-28 297,356 1,579,000 18.832021-01-27 417,382 2,509,300 16.632021-01-26 237,193 1,261,000 18.812021-01-25 471,634 1,916,803 24.61"
 so many negative posts. Lots of people soooo upset with their puts and shorts. This thing is definitely going to 200s by end of Q2. It’s no brainer 7.25/share in Q1 and 500 million share repurchase! This GREAT news lol. I’ve been right there whole time since.
This is value investing stock. The intrinsic value is higher the current value. It’s a safe bet that it will continue higher.
"Slowly but surely business is coming back, but Dillard's is not ready. Management has had a year to improve the way they do business, and have done nothing. Highly paid store managers and management are counting clearance signs, and reporting their count to corporate. This is a testimony to the sad state of systems at Dillard's"
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Companies that post this high EPS Like DDS have share prices in range of 450-550. I am now a true believer that it will go over 350 by end of Q3.
91.03% of the float still remains short- hold on to your shares!
"Barron’s posted about this stock today. 91% short interest, low float... I did some follow up DD and found solid fundamentals, I can’t help but think these will only improve as vaccinations and stimulus increase. People will want to get out of the house again.I just bought in 10 shares after hours as a an initial position for speculative long term investment."
Round 1 of the massive short squeeze on the horizon!
Why would Yahoo allow a report on its home page with a list of stores that are closing if its not true
"According to SEC filings, Dillard’s acquired more shares recently."
Can't break resistance..... Watch Weschler and other executives
"What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. This is more relevant than ever when it comes to $JWN $DDS"
Do it for yourself. You’ll see all the great points. Closing stores means they’re cutting off low performance stores which is healthy. It cuts the costs. They also opens news stores. You’ll see that in F/S. Read that for yourself.
I'm not bothered by the dip. They’ll post profits In Q4. It's grow back organically.
A lot of people taken profit... Even company owned shares. Sweet money off the back of the very company you helped pump. Comes with the territory
That round figure there after hours buying minipulating price yesterday 173 today 176
Soon... the Q2 earnings will be released. I can’t wait! Infrastructure bill might super charge this.
Up 85% since a May 14th low of $21.50 and it is just warming up.
Business is booming in southern states!

Been saying this is going downhill since the $180 now $155 next $130 then back to $100. They take all your money and this dbag is saying “ best company in the world” right buddy thanks for the money!
"The younger generation is interesting.. they don’t need fancy silverware to impress friends, polo shirts, nice shoes, or much luggage ( many are minimalist), and since they stay in their rooms.. on the internet they don’t use much cologne or perfume. Most all things Dillard sales.. no wonder Trump has to pass great corporate tax relief so that most companies can post a profit during time of lost REVENUE. Did I read it correctly down 10% lost rev? Now the new gen has a reason to buy less in the coming months.. even lower tax refunds to consumers. The 9% less refunds reported by the IRS includes high incomes too.. actually the refunds to people making under $70K is down by 34%... i.e. it doesn’t look good for any retail....."
"Johnny boy Dillard's does have a rare opportunity to secure a niche, but because of their old-school with an emphasis on ""old"" management it will slip away."
"Selloff over, happened yesterday between 9:00 and 11:00. Those that had good profits, and those that thought it was too high got out on NEWS. Selloff now over. DDS should grind higher (about 240.00) in next few weeks.Company continues to repurchase shares. Even though shorts covered most of their positions over the past year, the number of shares available continues to shrink. Only about 4mm shares float after you subtract Dillards trust children shares and employee trust shares Should also move higher on Telsy upgrade this morning."
And first of all there’s no article. I don’t see it. I even typed that person’s name and the date. I don’t see it. Stop playing.
dds will miss earnings. insider scoop. departments are dowm millions from 4th quarter oct-dec 2019. if they beat earnings it will be a miracle. not sure how they are goona pull it off. nothing to gain or lose. just passing the info along. i sold my dds last june.
If Target has lower EPS than DDS and yet they are in 200s. Dillard’s are more profitable than target so you know what’s coming up in next few months.
Below average volume sell off
Would rather sell for peanuts or hold for a bigger profit? This thing will go to $300s
Short interest up to 1.4mm from 1.3mm.Company repurchased another 250K shares in May.Float now only 5.128 million.float was calculated as total shares less shares held by newport trust (employee plan - wd& company - insiders). Shorts now 27% of float.Company repurchased over 700k shares since proxy material waas sent 3/18/21.
"A lot more juice left in this one. A great consolidation taking place. With earnings just about a little over a week left, a perfect storm is forming. Volume is quiet as investors await earnings and guidance if any. If the last Q is any indication and holiday shopping up on us, I believe it is going to gush out of the gate"
"i see float of Shares Outstanding 5 17.99MFloat 5.55MWhatever difference meansAnd short is currently 4,440,000almost 100% of the float??? I would attack DDS like GME."
"Look at the last “financial crisis” in 2008 and see how the bullish run continues for 6 years. It went up 3,500%.... however this is not the reason why I’m investing. I invested in Dillard’s because the management are smart with cash inflows and outflows compared to competitors. Also, the nature of the retail boom will last through 2021 and 2022. We humans are social creatures and we want to make up the lost year with the pandemic. Still holding it strong."
"John, your real estate value per share is half the real value of $200-240 per share. 300 stores @ $20 million each = $6 billion. inventory is enough to pay off all the liability. 25 million shares and shrinking that's over $225 per share. am I missing something???"
"The Steele vs John battle rages on. LOL. None of us know where this is headed. Very unpredictable. Looking at 10 year charts this is trading very high, however we are in the middle of a retail boom. The market will look 6-9 months forward as it always does. That is the ticket here. How long will the boom last. It will drop signifcantly when things settle down. It may have more room to run short term. The key is to bail when the ""retail bricks and mortar is dying"" arguement takes hold again."
"This company is definitely going to be 150-200+. They doing better than Nordstrom that is valued 3x more and on top of that they own real estate. This is a no brainer, it's gonna go up!"
$300 stock by end of next year! Shoulda..woulda..coulda..still buy the dips!!
"Look at Yahoo EPS. It’s 20.31. Take that number time 15. That’s is the fair share price. You can see it’s at a discount. Don’t forget, Q3 and Q4 is going to be amazing!"
Who said brick and mortar are dying? Amazon are building department stores and Target said the online sales slowed down as more people shop at the stores. We love touching and feeling the product before we make the purchase. Dillard's are here to stay forever. They will continue to make money. Let's go Dillards. We got this.
"Every time I've visited a Dillards store in the past two years, the stores were empty. Just because someone who works for Buffett bought shares, it's up 37% today? It may be time to take the other side of this trade."
We are the 99%There’s a lot more of us then them.
"Over reaction due to Corona Virus fear. Company is doing good, Dividend is good.Hopefully should be ok in long run. $M has way better P/E than competition. On management now how fast it handles loss making store closings and then turns it around. I am long. Similar stocks $JWN, $DDS,$ KSS etc.in the same retail category are down."
My source is the Yahoo Home page not the finance page. The story has a ALDI store picture at the start and if you open it and go in DDS came up on this page of closing 200 stores. Thats why I asked for advice on this.
"the real estate value is worth $6 billion or $300+ per share. a typical store is approximately 167,000 sf plus the parking lot. $20 million a store x just shy of 300 stores. inventory at cost pays off all debt."
will move up close to earning. this earning will be a blockbuster and good guidance
"Yield to maturity is another way to look at the unsecured bonds of similar retailers, which show strength/weakness in the equity... DDS bonds have YTMs right around 6.4% for those maturing over the years 2023-2028. JWN bonds maturing in that range carry a YTM of 7.0%. Macy's bonds in that range are yielding around 12%. The bond market is willing to pay a premium price (lower yield) for DDS bonds because they are more likely to actually be paid off, in the market's eyes. This is even though DDS has the lowest credit rating of the three (BB+). So go figure that. The equity value of each is down about 50% since the start of the year. So even though the equity casts these as the same, the bonds are telling a different story."
Dillard’s also realized the importance of internet shopping. They’ve expanded the dropshipping program and continues to increase their footprints in that world.
Here Comes 60
"Well, congratulations to Johnny boy he called it...it happened nothing left to be said"
Nice action today! Still undervalued though!
"Dillards increases their quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.20, a 33.3% increase."
"DDS earned $.1.43 per share!!! Fantastic. Let this soak in. Most wanna be tech companies unable to make a penny and they may never make any profit. Yet, DDS a - undervalued, less than $50 stock - in the slow Q3 made $1.43. This is not even the holiday season. Sure, sure ""but COVID-19""..so what? We know it is just matter of time and it will be over. DDS is a long term gold mine!"
"Besides the fundamentals, that could probably support the current price even without the impending squeeze, the technicals are looking ripe for an explosion. I hope management makes hay while the sun shines. Just announce a 5:1 stock split first and a ""new online"" strategy. Then, let the stock run up 400% on the short and gamma squeeze. Finally issue shares and pay off the $600M in debt. It can even run up to a $20B market cap with a GME/AMC like situation. But my target is $500 or $10B."
The September consumer spending rose modestly. Overall Q3 is better than Q2. Here’s my EPS prediction for Q3. Low 7.50Mid 9.00High 10.50The SP will be 285.
"Up 6.5% on now news this Friday. Nice! Their store was busy last weekend too. This stock can double in a year or so. No hyped tech stock can do that anymore, they are already overvalued. Buy, Buy, Buy"
"Short Squeeze possible. Pass this info on to reddit.Float Percentage of Total Shares Outstanding = Float Shares / Total Shares Outstanding= 4.24 / 22.00= 19.26%Company Market Cap (M) Short Percentage of FloatDDS Dillard's Inc $ 1,847.81 146.36%"
"This is me 2 months ago. “My prediction, it go up and down based on market’s roller coaster but at end it will continue upwards to 150-160 in next month or so. Once the Q2 earnings come out, it’ll explode upwards to breaking 200s.“. It looks like I’m wrong, maybe it explode close to 300. "
How much money did you lose while shorting this? 
"Dillard’s have reached 130/share before at the valuation of 5 billion in 2012-2013. Since Dillard’s has been buying up shares, therefore it makes it more attractive. If it reaches the same market cap as it did before, we’re talking about 250/shares because of fewer outstanding shares. I can see this range from 130-170 by Summer."
Good news. Dividend will be paid. Time to buy
"Spring is here, everyone is getting vaccinated and ready to travel. That mean everyone will be out shopping for fresh new clothes. Great business for Dillard’s."
These analysts' earnings estimates for Dillard's are lazy and make no sense. They already earned $7.25 in Q1; and the low-ball estimates for Q2 and Q3 are 0.58 and 1.44 respectively. The full year estimate is for $9.55. So what are these analysts trying to say? That they expect DDS to earn 0.27 for the Christmas quarter?
"Market is all green, only gabbage down Gme dds amc and all the genius stocks"
Oh boy what happened?
"Went thru $40 like a hot knife on a butter. Next resistance at $42.09 according to Barchart. No doubt it will cut thru that to. 3Q could only be better. With better online footing and Holiday season around the corner, it takes madness to hold a short position on this one. Let’s see how far it could go"
company has been buy back it stock. large short position as insiders and company pension plan has over 10 million share out of 23 million outstanding as of February 20.
“Opportunities multiply as they are seized.”Sun Tzu
Any positive expectations on earnings next month?? Think it'll be a blow out??
How does it look like with the new but back for the stock price tomorrow bullish it’s bearish any thoughts??
Owning a piece of company that’s based in southern states are best thing ever when you have logical governors unlike mine in NY.
"I'm trying to rationalize the inordinate short position on DDS.. Short % of Float (Sep 15, 2020) 4 146.36% I don't know much about this stock, so admittedly I could be wrong but I don't see any rational to justify this lopsided short position! Am i missing something? I don't see this company going bk any time soon, so can someone please explain to me in layman's terms how does this make any sense?"
Good earnings- I think we're prime for a nice up day in SP tomorrow!
"Seems $DDS is basically a primary SPAC vehicle for Chan Heng Fai (about 30% owner of shares... for those that don't know). High risk, but he as a track record of buying and spinning companies. I originally invested 3 years ago because they have some good IP patents. I have averaged down and trade around enough to be in a fair position, but on the fundamental side it is a bit of a flyer speculative play. Company revenue growth on the document security side seams less the focus than acquiring various companies to flip or spin. Based on several acquisitions last year, I am looking forward to the Q4 report (which is always late)."
"It’s stock, it goes up and down. At the end it will be higher. Nothing ever goes up everyday, don’t let couple down days make kids like Steele think he is an expert. "
Dillard’s is a healthy value investment. They aren’t going anywhere.
Volume way to low to get this Spruce Goose off the ground can't make it to the end of the runway. $200.00
