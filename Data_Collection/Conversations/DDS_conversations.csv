Where’s Silky and “Give me a break” guy?  can you offer your expertise advice so I can do opposite what you said?
Would rather sell for peanuts or hold for a bigger profit? This thing will go to $300s
"I’m proud of you DDS, keep it up. Your management team did really good job!"
Technically 154 is very important. If it holds or fails we could see a significant break either way.
Dillard's reached an all time high at 220.36
"Selloff over, happened yesterday between 9:00 and 11:00. Those that had good profits, and those that thought it was too high got out on NEWS. Selloff now over. DDS should grind higher (about 240.00) in next few weeks.Company continues to repurchase shares. Even though shorts covered most of their positions over the past year, the number of shares available continues to shrink. Only about 4mm shares float after you subtract Dillards trust children shares and employee trust shares Should also move higher on Telsy upgrade this morning."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Great run! Taking big $$$$ ! time to go for me!
Very cheap with $31 earnings !!
"Well, congratulations to Johnny boy he called it...it happened nothing left to be said"
Check out the SEC filing. Lots of insiders buying at $206. You know what's up!
Not selling till it hits $400.
Who said brick and mortar are dying? Amazon are building department stores and Target said the online sales slowed down as more people shop at the stores. We love touching and feeling the product before we make the purchase. Dillard's are here to stay forever. They will continue to make money. Let's go Dillards. We got this.
Dillard's reached an all time high at 228.81
"The cryptographic money market is presently worth more than the world's most significant organization after bitcoin and a few driving altcoins flooded in cost. The worldwide crypto market cap is currently $2.37 trillion (£1.73tn), overwhelming the $2.33tn market cap of Apple, coming to above $58,000 to surround its record-breaking high of $64,000.

"Dillard's is ridiculous at this share price. Stock is limited, supply chain issues, etc. They're no different than any other retailer, same problems. It's going down! Just go to the store and look around, you'll see."
DDS is going to have to make a big move if we’re going to 350 by the end of Q3!!
"DDS has never traded above $100 per share. I am amazed to see it at $200! When the market drop comes around, I will get back in toDDS. It is a super company, but much too expensive at this price."
"Lmfao, it’s a game. It’ll bounce back."
This is value investing stock. The intrinsic value is higher the current value. It’s a safe bet that it will continue higher.
I think the big money is starting to flow out of DDS and will continue to do so over the next few months. A year ago is when it started to flow in so makes sense to lock in the massive gains at long term capital gains rates as they time in. The investment thesis and risk/reward doesn’t make sense at this level. Better places to put money to work.
"Johnny boy Dillard's does have a rare opportunity to secure a niche, but because of their old-school with an emphasis on ""old"" management it will slip away."
Just shaking off weak hands. Insiders bought this in at 185 and 206. DDS got excellent earnings better than M and JWN.
"Earnings Strength is VERY NEGATIVEFord's earnings momentum measures the acceleration or deceleration in trailing 12 monthoperating earnings per share growth. The downward curvature of the plotted points in the graphon the right indicates that while Dillard's Inc.'s earnings have increased from $-4.73 to anestimated $20.04 over the past 5 quarters, they have shown strong deceleration in quarterlygrowth rates when adjusted for the volatility of earnings. This is an indication of weakness thatcould lead to declining earnings."
I've seen this dance before. It goes up and down then BOOM it soars up 50-70% in next few days. I look forward to that day :)
And there it is again 186 after hours manipulation
Nice action today! Still undervalued though!
Dillard's reached an all time high at 231.84
The September consumer spending rose modestly. Overall Q3 is better than Q2. Here’s my EPS prediction for Q3. Low 7.50Mid 9.00High 10.50The SP will be 285.
After hours buying stock manipulation nice round figure 
"Dillards increases their quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.20, a 33.3% increase."
That round figure there after hours buying minipulating price yesterday 173 today 176
"So, where does Dillard's inventory come from?"
Companies that post this high EPS Like DDS have share prices in range of 450-550. I am now a true believer that it will go over 350 by end of Q3.
"Dillards has the luxury of last man standing environment. Many big box retailers have disappeared. People for the most part want to touch, feel and try on clothes to get the right fit before buying. Amazon drives people crazy with all that shipping back and forth. Dillards has a clear growth path for 3-5 years."
Seen this song and dance before. People crowding in to buy and shorts getting nervous. Not a pressure cooker yet but will pop off to $230-240 by friday. Making money with DDS is like shooting fish in a barrel.
"This was expected,but thought it would come sooner. The money is drying up stores panicking doing unplanned additional sales. Dillard's down the highest percentage wise amongst it's competitors for today."
Retail spending rose in August. I can definitely see the Q3 EPS to be higher than Q2...
"Charles Schawb upgraded their stock grade on DDS to A from B, performing better than 91% of the competition compared to only 82% last week.Zacks upgraded the stock from 3-Hold to 1-Strong Buy and has listed the department as the #1 retailer in the US.Barchart has increased the short-term bullish strength of DDS to 100%, the maximum possible.Tipranks has upgraded the stock from 3-Underperform to 6-Neutral. Even a small upgrade is better than a downgrade.This stock sounds like a real winner."
"Hey Shorty! The only money that is drying up is your investment portfolio. Before you make another irrational investment, research the top brass at Dillards and compare to the rest of the industry."
