"There are two gaps on the chart that needs to be filled. One is $89.25 and the other is $99.70. Gaps almost always get filled. I thnk WYNN could very well get back to $100 by year end, where the next big resistence is."
Great time to add..
"Just short another 200 shares today, this is the best way to hedge my portfolio."
This is no longer an investment......China holds all the cards and they have a Royal Flush.
"Cramer and his Goons started buying casino stock a few weeks ago. Then the CEO for LVS was on Cramer and another random analyst popped up and said that MGM was a great buy. Expect the short interest to show up in a few weeks. Seriously? Casinos? Inflation rising, cost of oil rising, supply chain backed up, China, and everything else under the sun... and the solution is Casino's??"
We going back to the 100’s. Keep buying
BREAKING: Macau's government announces that they'll allow many in Hong Kong to visit Macau for the first time since the pandemic began. GGR is going to get a massive boost September onward.$LVS $WYNN $MGM $MLCO
Institutions are dumping shares!
Well done Bulls. Well done!!
"The news that is circulating is that the Macau wants to appoint people to oversee the casinos. They are worried about the money leaving the country and money laundering. No down this make sense to for China regulators but it will not impact the overall picture.You have to ride this one out because in the end, these casinos are all doing really well and will continue to run hard. Don't get shaken out of the market. Use it to buy more or sit on your hands while the dust settles.I am going to buy more as I believe this whole sector has considerable upside."
"Total profited shares proportion for WYNN is 47%if you want to know what is happening in macau, just look at Wynn Macau Ltd stock(1128.HK)it dropped from $9 to $6 in last 2 days, lost over 30% of total price.people in macau take it way more seriously cuz they can see the real situation.$86 under china crisis? still overrated."
Time for WYNN to shine!
"Another Green Day, Look at that Pop!"
"Wynn is awesome and there is nothing China can do to it , that the leftists in the US havent already tried."
Maybe Wall Street bets will back this stock since it’s being heavily shorted now
20 years of Wynn Macau and it couldn't pay for itself.Not even close. The debt is actually CLIMBING at WYNN!!!
I was trying to short this at 83 and afraid I made terrible mistake! TIME TO RECOOP MY LOSSES AND GO LONG! SHORTS WE NEED TO COVER! 100+ INCOMING!
"WYNN, LVS, Chinese internet, and cruise line stocks are the best buys."
Nothing has changed in Macau. people still gamble and spend lots of money on entertainment.
Hong Kong reopens their border today to mainland China and Macau without any type of quarantine needed. Decreasing restrictions whether it’s outgoing or incoming always benefits travel in both directions. Positive development for Macau.$LVS $WYNN $MGM $MLCO

Says something to be holding on and even slightly up when market getting crushed today.
$125 to s coming by the end of this month.Like if you agree and I believe in this stock; i was in this LV and this hotel is very very busy
You gotta love waking up in the morning down 8%. This is another time to buy this one down. I am going to continue to load up on WYNN because I now the underlying business is growing rapidly.
Bought PENN. If one is going to play any casino buy into a domestic one like BOYD or PENN. Outside the US is extreme risk and not for me.
"Macau casinos are down on 2 developments that are being misinterpreted and bulls should take advantage.1. Covid outbreak in Fujian province: This is a province that barely impacts Macau's average daily visitors, as long as it's controlled GGR shouldn't be impacted significantly. 2. Public consultation of Macau's gaming law: This was expected for months and is the first stage in the process to renew or extend Macau's casino licenses. This is a good development that tells us we should get an answer in late October or November.$LVS $WYNN $MLCO $MGM"
"Game over for WYNN.... Time to fold!With 70% of revenues depending on Macau and half of that has disappeared due to COVID, today's announcement from the Chinese government is the biggest blow for WYNN. The stock can easily drop 50% from here since there is no other growth story for Wynn in the next 2 years. Game over and time to get out quickly!"
"WYNN, (Trade) has been reiterated by Morgan Stanley as a overweight at 113.0."
Will most likely consolidate to 70-75 range before moving back up to 100+ after commotion dies down. People are acting as if Macau will have zero earnings moving forward.
"This is the best tweet I've found so far that explains the Macau casino situation, share this bulls.https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1437818402068893702?s=20$LVS $MLCO $WYNN $MGM"
The fact that it's not going up with the rest of the market...ouch
Fire sale. Yum yum.
Wynn was in a bad shape ever since the majority stockholders/owners fought 2 years ago during their divorce. Now it will practically be run by Chinese government with changes being proposed. Smart people should take the small loss and get out while you can....$80 is still a great price in light of the latest developments.......... Or wait until it hits $40 in next few weeks!
WYNN is a 100+ stock period. Bought the dip yesterday .....will let it ride long back to 100+ .....LFG!
"Wynn needs to release a statement to help calm down investors. Either way, long term, great buy point"
This stock is in an oversold situation.
Back to $120-$130. 
Lots of people sold when the stock recovered to 100. No doubt it is good to take some money off the table but I would encourage everyone to hold WYNN for a few more quarters. It was way oversold and the business is recovering much faster than the stock would indicate. Holding this one will be very rewarding.To the comments of the travel numbers below. Vegas has seen a significant increase in visitors. Group business is coming back strong and people want to get back to some of the activities that drive business and pleasure.I believe this stock will reclaim recent highs. We just need to be patient.
"Can you imagine the FOMO investors will have when the Golden Week Holiday GGR numbers come out from Macau in early October? Analysts are expecting October to have the highest GGR number of the year. This is the easiest swing in the market, I prefer LVS and WYNN.$LVS $WYNN $MGM $MLCO"
China wants total control of MacauWynn gets 70% of its revenue from Macau Las Vegas being packed means nothing
Short squeeze coming!
I am NEVER following Jim Chamos into a short position/ trade EVER AGAIN!! After listening to the Cramer interview it's clear Wynn will bounce back and my short was a HUGE MISTAKE! Congrats I guess to the bulls.. You won this time...
Tough week for the 'ole WYNN. Down 20% for the week. That's rough in any language.
"Hello Everyone Thanks for all insightful comments.Simple question from someone who doesn’t understand much about politics and economy WYNNBUY, HOLD or SELL…?"
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SH6K
"Bullish new data from Macau’s Secretary of Economy/Finance- Over 30,000 visitor arrivals last Friday for the first time since July.- Between September 3 to 9 there was a total of 168,300 visitors and a daily average of 23,400, that’s 82.2% higher than last month’s August average.- The Secretary said that Golden Week will bring in more visitors to Macau and they’ll invest more into promotion/advertising to show that Macau is a safe place to travel.$LVS $WYNN $MLCO $MGM"
"So why this ""could be"" cheap is on a ""humming"" basis back in 2018/2017 WYNN was doing $6B in Revs. So you back out most of Macau (15%) of biz...so maybe they get back to 5B so it's 2x sales...but what kind of a grower?????"
"You can find out how Macau casinos are doing from the Macau Youtubers, business is dead because the new Covid Variant is spreading. The Golden week coming in October will be dead."
The withdrawals from Wynn start on Sep 23 when visas renewed. Patrons will be pulling out billions. The line of credit was provided only to make the Chinese government a secured creditor in the Macau sub bankruptcy.
Way over valued! Traveling is dead now that there are no staff even if folks are will to pay MORE FOR WVERYTHING!F Sip!
"Cash $2.8BB, DEBTS $12BB, insane value, over bought"
"glad we got that gap out of the way, now lets test the top of the range around 250 per share by next month"
At what price does WYNN jump off the top floor of one of his casinos? That’s capitulation day.
Any reading to recommend?
I'm out. Good luck to longs but China is becoming more unpredictable. Dangerous situation all 'round.
"Read about Xi's goals regarding gambling in Macau: supervised by government officials, local ownership, monitoring of deposits, and most importantly, entities will mandate local ownership. Then tell me if Wynn will continue to attract billionaires that gamble mainly to get money out of China. In my opinion, with all of the trade war and tensions with nuclear submarines nearby, Wynn's license will not be renewed. Kiss 80% of your EBITDA good bye, but you get to keep the debt."
LVS and WYNN were already discounted before the panic of the sheep 2 days ago. Way overdone.
"I live in Vegas, the WYNN is packed. Don't listen to the media, they have been misleading throughout this whole pandemic hype."
"""... continued fears of tighter regulations on casino companies operating in Macau, China."" Translation: More skimming and bribes."
WAY OVERSOLD HERE ! TIME TO GET MORE. Mr Wynn WILL DO HIS OWN MAGIC WORK AND WYNN WILL BE TRADING IN TRIPLE DIGITS NEXT WEEK!
Nice reversal for WYNN!! Overdone on the downside. Sold Puts at $85 for Friday.
I’m buying and will be selling for a solid gain in a month
This is priced at when we had no vaccines and the world was coming to an end.
A Rocket Ship from 101.70…..seems institutions are interested in the channel checks …..both LV & Macau are ready to explode.
I am buying every day. This is so very nice.
china is going to nationalize these casinos. Why give westerners 50% of revenue in macau. Can be 100% china
Manipulative shorts are getting desperate..

I bought wynn in year 2014 from a bank. At that time i only have 700 shares plus $100+ balance return to me from a sum of $200k. Thereafter the shares keep dropping. There is no way i can recover my lost. I fell sick after seeing what happen to wynn last night.
$30 is the bottom. Check BABA & PE. This isn't better with slowing Chinese economy and Xi roaring with questions n oversight !
How low will go?
"The only people I see worried about Delta are the people on CNBC. The rest of the world, or at least what I see of it every day, has moved on. Airports, bars, malls, restaurants are all packed."
cover your short heading strait up
Have a buy order in for 200 shares at $90.
Love making money with someone else's money...LOL thanks Chanos!!!!!
Congratulations to those who bought @89 . Ignoring the shorts was not difficult apparently.
Heading to $60
"On the chart, need to get through the 50 day moving average at $92.48. Then close the gap at $99.70 and then the 100 day is $105.03. By year end? Looks like we could get through the 50 day today."
All I see is what Danica mentions and that BlackRock sold its WYNN shares from two different funds their advantage SMID cap fund & Advantage global fund.
Another great sign for longs are the shorts/bashers are here in full force now. Seems they are nervous now. We'll see.
China is preparing for war with the United States when they take over Taiwan in the next few years. Right now they are taking steps to separate themselves financially from the US financial interests in China￼￼. WYNN is an American company whose gambling clientele is mostly Chinese. So what I think is that the CCP is going to do is let the Chinese gamble but gouge into WYNN’s profits. I was looking to buy a position in WYNN but as soon as the Chinese government got involved I’m out. Keep an eye on Nike and the NBA (both US business that have turned communist) -that will tell you what is going to happen to WYNN per the dictates of the CCP.
Stay long on the market and WYNN. I am a net buyer today.
"This is a sinking ship. China will do what they want to their advantage and restructure the whole Macau gaming agreement to squeeze more money from the owners. By next year, this will be a $50 stock."
"There are some cities locked down in China right now, the new Delta Variant is spreading fast in China.More locked down is expected, Macau Casino will not make any money for next few months because their major income is from the Chinese people . This stock is going to $60 next month."
China doesn’t need Americans with all our cultural issues nowadays. They have become the number 1 power. They will slowly weed out any American investments in their country.
Solid interview on Cramer tonight which gave much more clarity for the future! Back to 100 we go!! Shorts need cover before it’s too late!!
under 140 the price of not being able to have a license in macau is already priced in. we are now at 80dollars .. waw! thats some real fomo
"WAY OVERSOLD!!!

"Market cap 10 Billion,. Value of company 20 Billion plus!! Great buy with the addition of online sports gambling!!"
All depends on how the CCP rolls. Thinking they will gradually ease up.
The panic is has reached a high for the day. Oversight by China is going to be directed to money laundering and taking money out of the country. As long as WYNN and LVS are not trying to profit from those illegal activities then this will have no bearing on the true value of these companies. China is creating a massive buying opportunity and the most likely outcome is that these companies thrive with increased tourism and improved demand. Unfortunately the selling is not going to be done overnight. You will need to wait it out to get rewarded.Blood is now in the streets.
"$WYNNMacau’s recovery from its latest COVID-19 setback appears to be underway with gross gaming revenue said to be 55% higher in the week from 16 to 22 August than during the seven days prior.According to brokerage Bernstein’s weekly channel checks, average daily GGR increased from MOP$78 million to MOP$120 million (US$10 million to US$15 million) during the most recent week, aided by the gradual relaxation of travel restrictions across mainland China. Visitation from 14 to 18 August was also up 168% on the week from 6 to 12 August although still down 42% from July’s daily average.COVID-19 cases in the mainland have passed 1,200 since an outbreak was first detected in Nanjing on 20 June but have since plummeted, with no new local cases reported nationwide on Monday."
So chanos comes on CNBC to pump his short on WYNN. Now you know why it has gone down. I am sure he will start to cover soon and has/will use this opportunity to start the cover. Love how it is legal for them to go on CNBC and pump or short a stock and then watch it move based on their lying lips.
"I hope we get more negative news and uncertainty. Even a sell off in the broader market that affects WYNN would be great. The lower this stock goes the better the risk profile when buying more shares or adding call options.This is a gift, I just wish the gift could turn into more of a winning lottery ticket :)"
"Wow, so buy now and it will be back over $100 by end of year. That is over 18% in less than 3 months. Yep, I am in with stock, call options, and writing puts. Buy my puts that I write."
Looks like we are headed down to close that gap on the chart from last November at $80. Probably a good buy there.
New covid 19 infectious cases has led to drop in the share price. Lots of cancellations for bookings for theGolden week
"Wow what a buying opportunity, thank you panic sellers!"
"At this price it trades as ifMacau revs are zero, which isabsolutely not true. All of theseconcession and license renewal talk have to do with the massive money laundering that takes place there. They want officials at the local level on the gaming floors to heed illicitactivity much like Atlanta and Vegas already do. WYNN CEO was just on with Cramer and says he is ""very bullish on Macau!"" I mean how can you not be buying this dip!?"
I would not be surprised if it opens $90 + tomorrow.
"Don't catch the falling knife, this is a $40 stock by end of the year. China policy is so unpredictable right now."
"I just don't see how wynn gets out alive. I suspect they might abandon Macau before China seizes all properties. This goes to 30-40 where chanos said, then they can focus on vegas and a dying Boston property"
Wynn resort = 75% macau + 25% us20year casino license ends June 2022
Hedgefund is dumping Wynn Resort
"Wynn is safer play than lvs, it still has las vegas, and boston casinos, lvs has none in usa."
Congrats to all longs and everyone who bought the dip during the sell off! 100 here we come!
Read / watch CEO's interview with Cramer. He said these regulations are healthy and will make Macau as reugulated as Vegas. WYNN is going back up!!
vegas property selling for half valuation here. Wynn is basically overvalued by over 50% chanos is right
Why?

"Buy now. Stock will get a boost from FAST MONEY, CNBC, with the HYPE the panelists will utter. Coming up."
"Always three days. Mid day tomorrow up,it goes. I finally just bought a large amount. Lvs is the better stock but Wynn will be fine. Heading out to Vegas in a few weeks. I’ll straighten things out. "
"Way undervalued, should be trading at $120 levels."
Reading the shorts/bashers on here is entertaining. Next they are going to say men from Mars are coming to bankrupt WYNN at the tables.
RSI almost below 30 now....
"Today this closes green. That is my bet and I bought stock, wrote puts, bought calls."
Cramer gonna buy

Worked here for 15 years. Don't buy it.
"This dip is oversold and the funds that are out with a hold rating are actually buying hand over fist. Funny how they tend to do this all the time....like miss the sell or hold when it is high. They only come out after the stock has tanked. Should be illegal, but wallstreet protectes it's own feltchers."
I got some a little earlier. I’m bullish on WYNN. Open up time coming soon.
China is trying to figure out how to get their cut....
It will be back above $110 by the end of October.
This is a nothing but an re-run of a few weeks back. That was the easiest trade of all time back to the 100 plus range. About to replicate again.
I think it’s illegal to have people like chanos speak during days like this. It’s like Ackman speaking during the height of covid creating a scare and pumping his oil
"Just as I have blogged, you can't invest in anything involving China, governed by that DICTATOR XI.The investor playing any Chinese stock just can't plan for anything positive, particularly long term.AVOID ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES CHINA. It's a MARXIST country led by Marxists/Dictators."
I would like to thank all the shorts in advance for when they have to cover call their position. 
This stock is not a buy until China renew their license.
The Macau casino stocks have sure made a lot of 'investors' look very FOOLISH. This includes the so called 'big boys'.
Based on cosmo sale wynn is a 300 dollar stock. Chanos better cover
"Very, very good interview by Cramer today with the WYNN CEO. Google it. Everything is fine, lot's of false things being pushed by the shorts and future is very bright. Cramer loves the stock."

The market is due for a huge crash and US stocks will be down 50% by the end of the year. Biden wants all of us to stand in line for food."

A lot of paid pumpers on this board assisting hedge funds EXITING their positions!
I just love how CNBC puts all the shorts on shows when the market is already down over 2%. CNBC just loves to DUMP and PUMP markets on a daily basis.
"Wynn holds 1 of the 3 original concessions that were selected in 2002 public tender. The others (sands China, mgm China, and Melco) were sub-concessions. These sub-concessions are where the problems are arising from. Macau doesn’t want sub-concessions in the next round of public tender. Wynn has a strong foothold here and already has finished the plan on the Crystal Pavilion extension in Macau, a huge attraction that will only boost Macau’s tourism and leisure sector. Wynn also has the confidence of renowned Linda Chen who has navigated these waters since the Steve Wynn days. I am confidently buying the dip here."
Fearful selling volume is drying up. Folks that now casinos are packed and will continue to be packed are buying big here. It will be a good sign if it closes over $84.50

"I love how suddenly we have all these great investment advice from people about how WYNN is terrible, gaming is gone forever, younger people don't gamble, etc. I really appreciate all of this great free advice you guys are providing. The fear of China hit this stock awhile ago. The big money left it for dead in the recent selloff. If you are in it then you are going to ride this one out and profit from the overreaction. China is going to do the things that benefit the country. Destroying businesses is possible but the more likely outcome is to control businesses that have a potential to launder or move money out of the country. That oversight is not going to destroy the company.Having said all that, this stock will take time to heal. Keep buying these dips. It is only a matter of time before this story flips to positive."

Also, the fact that they will be regulating casino profitability is biggest hit for Wynn. With 70% of their business coming from Macau, Wynn can easily drop 50% from here. Time to fold and cut the losses!"
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Look at $WYNN from a different perspective. the selling from 143 to 80+ the first time was the smart money that had to get out. The move back to 106 was based on earnings and the strength of the business. Now we are back to Macau shutting down which has pushed the stock back to 79. If you have been scared out of the stock, you have already soldIf you have valued this stock lower, you have already soldIf you are the smart money, you have already soldIf you are short the stock because you think it is going lower, you have already soldAll this to say.... the risk has been calculated to this point. You need to decide what China will do to buy or own the stock ahead of knowing the future.The bet is China tries to control fraud and money leaving the companies. They also want to prevent people from getting hurt by gambling too much, etc.The only way the stock does not go up is if China makes earnings in Macau go to 0. That is what is factored in here."
"Chinese government regulation is no joke. If the government can regulate how many hours of games young people can play per week, what do you think it can do to regulate adult gambling?"
"If you noticed the drop in the last hour it was because of Jim Chanos, renowned short seller, who just hammered the stock. Said it is worth 'south of $50 a share'. He is shorting the stock, of course. Very negative on Macau stocks and WYNN'S positioning in on-line and physical sites in U.S. is way over valued."
Looks like this is consolidating around $84. Expect it to go up next week.
"All of the Macau casinos stock are down, customers are cancelling the reservations for the Golden week vacation."

I heard about WYNN the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Cramer thinks oversold based on his sum of the parts analysis of various scenarios. He is holding.

"This will be a $60 stock by next month, China government will not renew the casino license for American owned casino. Another lock down in China might happen next month because the new variant is spreading in China."

Price target 140!!
"China will do a full equity wipe, Wynn will lose 60% in market cap, but finally we can move on"
$75 by end of the week.... Should stabilize at $65 until the 45-day period is over. This stock is still pricey at $65 as there is zero catalyst for price support.

"What a gift if you plan to hold this through Macau coming back, maybe a few more months. Macau, Vegas, online gambling, cost cutting proven by last quarter's numbers, this is back to the 130's - 140's in 3 to 6 months."
"Wynn Resorts said in a filing it obtained a $1.5 billion credit facility from Bank of China Ltd. as it and other casinos that operate in the Chinese enclave of Macau face tighter government control over the industry. Wynn (ticker: WYNN) said the credit line will be used to refinance debt of Wynn Macau and its subsidiaries, and also to “fund ongoing working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.”"

"There is no question that this is tough situation because China is unpredictable. They have started to clamp down on things they consider damaging to their culture, society, etc.I am in big on WYNN as I was buying while it fell the first time. I did not sell when it recovered back to 105 and that was ultimately a bad decision. I am currently adding to my position simply because I believe that China is not going to destroy these businesses. They are going to try and control things but not to the point where they reduce the revenue significantly. My bet is that they add oversight to eliminate any fraud and money leaving the country.The alternative is to close casinos altogether and not have them as a part of their society. I don't believe they will do that for a multitude of reasons like losing control and gambling moving underground/online.The best outcome for everyone is to allow companies to prosper and maintain control. They are big on control and I doubt that changes."
CEO MADDOX couldn't say Wynn is sold out for Golden Week. Just mumbled about it being historically strong. Lol !!
