"If you noticed the drop in the last hour it was because of Jim Chanos, renowned short seller, who just hammered the stock. Said it is worth 'south of $50 a share'. He is shorting the stock, of course. Very negative on Macau stocks and WYNN'S positioning in on-line and physical sites in U.S. is way over valued."
"i dont see how people can be bearish in the long term. wynn is a great company, good returning income. it was hit last year for covid reasons and its dirt cheap.i mean really, do you think the rate of visitors will go up or down next year and the years after?"
Back to $120-$130. 
"This is the best article I've seen regarding the Macau regulatory situation, he breaks it down objectively.https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2021/09/16/opinion-irrational-panic-wipes-26-us18-4-billion-off-macau-operators-market-cap-yesterday/$LVS $MGM $MLCO $WYNN"
I believe that Asia is still going to be under pressure. US operations will remain hot and carry the company until new year. Asia needs to pick up early in 2022 to help push this much higher.
Congrats to all longs and everyone who bought the dip during the sell off! 100 here we come!
Asian stocks are skyrocketing . Meituan got fraction of the fine. WYNN is going higher!
"Cramer and his Goons started buying casino stock a few weeks ago. Then the CEO for LVS was on Cramer and another random analyst popped up and said that MGM was a great buy. Expect the short interest to show up in a few weeks. Seriously? Casinos? Inflation rising, cost of oil rising, supply chain backed up, China, and everything else under the sun... and the solution is Casino's??"
"On the chart, need to get through the 50 day moving average at $92.48. Then close the gap at $99.70 and then the 100 day is $105.03. By year end? Looks like we could get through the 50 day today."
"There are two gaps on the chart that needs to be filled. One is $89.25 and the other is $99.70. Gaps almost always get filled. I thnk WYNN could very well get back to $100 by year end, where the next big resistence is."
LOOOOOOOOOVVVVEEE WYNN. A HUGE buy at 89.00 and an easy profit at 125.00. OVER and over and over again. #wynn
Cramer club just endorsed and bought more shares in this per the newsletter. I was feeling lucky and decided to buy some as well.
Very few visitors in the Golden week in Macau reported by Macau Youtubers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySYmwMaBbHs&t=13s
"Wynn is safer play than lvs, it still has las vegas, and boston casinos, lvs has none in usa."
$125 to s coming by the end of this month.Like if you agree and I believe in this stock; i was in this LV and this hotel is very very busy
Looks like Jim Cramer's BUY on Wynn is having some difficulty after hours!
Read / watch CEO's interview with Cramer. He said these regulations are healthy and will make Macau as reugulated as Vegas. WYNN is going back up!!
Great time to add..
"Way undervalued, should be trading at $120 levels."
"I live in Vegas, the WYNN is packed. Don't listen to the media, they have been misleading throughout this whole pandemic hype."
