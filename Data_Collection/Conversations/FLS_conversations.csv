If we are to go off the RSI then you could argue that a pull back next day or so could occur on FLS before rallying up. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesom-eSTOCKS.

"Ratings seem to be all over the place from ""Reduce"" by ""Research Team"" to ""Long"" from ""Market Edge"" and ""Hold"" by ""The Street"". The catalyst that I'm focused on is still at least a year off which is Tellurian (TELL) building that massive new LNG facility down in Texas. Along with the plant there's also a whole bunch of pipeline that's going to be part of the deal and while I'm not a super-duper expert on LNG, I'm pretty sure that FLS's efforts to standardize a once fractured industry (through acquisitions over the past decade) they will likely be the most likely supplier of a lot of equipment for that new facility/pipelines. I could be full of shxx too... those contracts have almost certainly not been awarded yet. Still, that's my bet/gamble."
Read Barron's report on 4-24-2020. They have FLS ranked a buy. 1/2 off from their highs. This is a good stock to day trade. Look at today's action. After hrs. ran the stock up to open higher only to come crashing back down.

Downgraded I see this as someone is wanting to buy. We all know they use up/downgrades to take advantage of the markets. Flag pattern with a nice consolidation. Charts don't lie.
