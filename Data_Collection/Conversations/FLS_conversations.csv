So why is this tanking with the results it produced
FLS is down -4.92% to 40.76
"Earnings beat or miss? Company has a lot of debt, not good if and when interest do resume rising."
"Ratings seem to be all over the place from ""Reduce"" by ""Research Team"" to ""Long"" from ""Market Edge"" and ""Hold"" by ""The Street"". The catalyst that I'm focused on is still at least a year off which is Tellurian (TELL) building that massive new LNG facility down in Texas. Along with the plant there's also a whole bunch of pipeline that's going to be part of the deal and while I'm not a super-duper expert on LNG, I'm pretty sure that FLS's efforts to standardize a once fractured industry (through acquisitions over the past decade) they will likely be the most likely supplier of a lot of equipment for that new facility/pipelines. I could be full of shxx too... those contracts have almost certainly not been awarded yet. Still, that's my bet/gamble."
Going back to 35 by Summer.
Do you think the dividend is safe?
Read Barron's report on 4-24-2020. They have FLS ranked a buy. 1/2 off from their highs. This is a good stock to day trade. Look at today's action. After hrs. ran the stock up to open higher only to come crashing back down.

"They could build vetilators. They have the knowledge in their pharmaceutical segments, pumps, etc."

"This is a old company 1912; it makes 1/2 it's money repairing it's own valves. It's 99% owned by institutions and 85% by the top 20. If you have this in your portfolio and your not a money manager, your doing something right or maybe you should be, few will even see this post ."
FLS reached a new 52 Week High at 52.12
not that im complaining but the manipulation of this stock is crazy. In a 1 minute candle this jumps from 26.61 to 26.75...no prices in between and on very little volume.
Whoever sold this yesterday at $24. just saved themselves 9 div. payouts of 20 cents. Nice move.
