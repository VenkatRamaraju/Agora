Why is kansas selling. Seems like a pretty good business.
"As a longtime share holder in KSU I am opposed to the merger with CN. I don't believe it serves the best interest of the KCS especially its employees. The KCS has always been a unique railroad and profitable one despite its small size. A CP merger just make more sense. While the CN offer was higher the CN will be in debt and that is a major concern in the longterm. The CP offer allows growth in both combined railroads so the longterm is bright because there will be fair competition and the railroads can grow and expand. The CN sees that, why do you think the late bid to outdo the CP aggrement to purchase KCS? They see the competion, they know a CP-KCS merger is a threat. So they used their larger buying power to outbid. This is a modern day Morganization of a railroad. They basically can eliminate 30% of the NA rail system. Reason if the KCS-CN merger allowed the CP only alternative move is to be abosorbed by another mega railroad, it has no other choice. Thus CN eliminates its competion, that is Morganization. This is why I highly doubt the STB will approve this merger. I have always respected the KCS management, it has run this railroad the right way over the years. Mike Haverly got the KCS back, he brought on the Souther Belle passenger train, that is pride. Pride means a lot. Pride is good for investors and rail employees. Today I question managements decision here. As I wrote to the KCS board in May just because CN's offer is higher doesn't make it the right decision. They are risking our investments. If they would of accepted the CP merger agreement in which they had a gentlemans agreement on, the KSU stock would be booming by now not dropping. They now risk it even further by awaiting a STB approval to even continue the process. Then what after a year the board can and will in all likelyhood not approve it which will plummet the stock. This is gambling with investor money. You may as well go to the racetrack. They are wasting precious time, the CP merger would of been easily approved and shareholders reward but now you have to wait and hope and you've already seen what has happened to the stock. I can't wait to August to vote my NO to the CN merger, I urge all of you to vote NO, we need to take the CP offer. This is just my opinion but I believe it makes the most sense for longterm investors."

Wow. Right to the final minute. Tx STB way to look out for public interest
If you bought this stock 10 years ago you are banking on a 5000% rise. Wow
"I have people in Uganda my mother land who have gold and who want to trade in America,can Kansas City be in position to help me transport it within America’thanks"
Will KSU shareholders be given CN shares or cash??
"This doesn't like a very good deal. When I did the math, I come out ahead, but by not that much. I think that the bad part of the deal is receiving less than half a share for every KSU share owned. Receiving $90 is nice, since that is what I paid for my shares, but after that, the deal doesn't sound so exciting. I would vote 'NO'. They need to raise their price at least another 10% for me to change my mind. Another thing: the $90, is this USD or Canadian dollars? Regardless, it is still a NO."
$277 Monday. You can’t buy for the price listed now. Within 1 minute of before market or after hours trading it will shoot up.
"This thing is nuts. I got in at $130, but I should have mortgaged my house and borrowed from relatives to buy more stock."
I knew the STB wouldn't let the CN buy out happen. Competitive disadvantage. Now let's talk to the CP. They will let that by out occur.
Excellent buy in here. Usually when volatility strikes the RR's are pretty solid. And with the recent ER and outlook this little jewel looks like a bargain.
"No doubt your self-serving board is on the phne with Blackrock. Trying to scare up a better bid, and saving their own jobs in thep rocess. Just remember this: With Blackrock, or any other private equity buyer, you get your money and you're done. With the CP offer, you would continue to be equity owners......of the best-run, and sole North America-wide railco. Just ask former BNSF shareholders what their biggest regret is. Their cash payout was spent long ago, their dividend checks stopped, and Buffett has laughed all the way to the bank."
congress has to approve any change to nafta. that's not going to happen.
"I am surprised that KSU had to 'front' the $700m payment to CP?? I would have thought CNI would have covered that breakup fee when paid? If the KSU shareholders vote down the merger with CNI, does KSU still get the $2B penalty from CNI? Sounds like a stupid question, but, this deal hasn't smelled right to me since the announcement? Under what 'no go' outcome for the merger, is the $2B owed? Under what 'no go' scenario (if any) can CNI avoid the $2B penalty? If there are any conditions where CNI avoids the penalty, management owes the KSU shareholders an explanation prior to completion of the voting! Anyone seen the full agreement?"

"Here are some excerpts from a story today about the railroads from right here on Yahoo: Kansas City Southern’s carloads Kansas City Southern (KSU) is the smallest Class I railroad in the US. In the seventh week of 2018, KSU hauled 23,800 railcars, which was ~5% lower than the 25,000-plus railcars moved in Week 7 of 2017. KSU’s decline in carload traffic was much higher than the 0.6% slump reported by US railroads (GWR) in the seventh week of 2017.Kansas City Southern saw a 1.0% loss in overall railcar traffic in 2018’s Week 7. This was in sharp contrast with the 3.2% growth posted by US railroads (IYJ) in that week."

"Trading on Trump - If we have learned anything during the 100 days it’s that President Trump has no qualms about pivoting on almost any position that he so strongly took on the campaign trail. This is merely his way of setting the opening salvo in his negotiations. Donald put a big chip on the table in his game with Mexico today in drafting an exit strategy from NAFTA. Traders dumped KSU on the news but the trading is really about how protracted the dealings with Mexico become. If KSU continues to slide on Trump Trading, the buyers and holders will be rewarded when everyone’s cards finally hit the table."
this is a total gift right here. more buying. more buying.
Kansas City Southern is down 4.94% to 197.09
The two buy out offers for the KSU were mentioned at the Berkshire hathaway annual meeting. Warren mentioned that the KSU deal with Mexico ends in 2047. What happens after that?
A very sad day to be bought by another country! Glad it is not the OTHER ones!
Is it still possible to buy KSU stock? Decent purchase at the moment?
"I am just as happy to take a CP deal for my taxable account. A greater payment in shares (in kind) means less capital gains tax on the cash portion of the transaction. Plus, as KSU is relatively larger in a CP deal when compared to a CNI deal, maybe CP will have more share price upside, post takeover, if they nab KSU."
this has started its run hold on this will be $350 next week shorts will have to cover

"I could kind see this happening, but didn't buy when I could. A big miss on my part. Hope a deal goes through, as a North-South merger makes a lot of sense."
Go Kc Southern! All the RR are chooing along

"I find it a little strange that CNI states over and over that KSU is not a 'competitor' but they plan to break up and sell off the parts of KSU that they compete with! HUH??? Sounds like they want to dismantle a competitor?? Why do they need to do this if there is not an issue, there? I know we get more compensation for our KSU stock, but, CNI proposal doesn't pass the smell test! Not sure this is where I want 'my' railroad to go to these folks! Good luck fellow longs! Just my opinions!"

'tis many a slip.............
Question.With the CN offer of 33.7 billion and KCS outstanding shares of 90.93 million. That should equal $370.6 per share. Anyone know why KSU is trading way too low for this strong of offer.This has incredible over whelming support. I believe it's going to happen forsure.Please let me know What am I missing?Thank you
KSU anyone? No posts here for 6+ weeks now. Yahoo Finance updates do not count. Any KSU employees on this MB?
"Just spitballing here......What's the chances that CN offer has a quiet little, undisclosed 'understanding' buried inside it ? One that might make the executives at KSU a lot more ""personally"" interested in seeing CN win ?CN would benefit greatly from having current KSU management stick around for awhile during a transition. After all, CN was likely not prepared to do this deal at this time...they were pushed into bidding as a knee-jerk reaction to CP's first move. These CN execs. have no skillset at integration. CN and KSU have very different corp. cultures.....hell, they literally don't even speak the same language! French isn't the 'language of business' anywhere, and certainly not in Mexico! I could easily see CN offering certain KSU executives 2-, 3-, or even 5-year contracts....real lucrative ones.....to stay in their jobs while CN figures out what it has and what it's doing. Such 'deals' don't show up in any transaction documents...if they did, they'd then become awkward and suspect ""conditions""....instead of the standard *wink wink* among greedy, self-serving gentlemen. CP, on the other hand, is (and was) totally up to speed on every detail about KSU. Internally prepared to hit the ground running after the takeover. A culturally much better fit. And Keith Creel's M&A integration hesume is very impressive.....he wouldn't even WANT any holdovers form KSU. At all. So....KSU shareholders might want to keep that in mind when they hear ""their"" management tell them to vote for the CN deal. Best for you? Or for them?"

"I just read an article, where the groups interested in acquiring KSU have supposedly sweetening their offer. Of course this is just speculation, but if true, it shows that KSU directors are trying to get as much money for the railroad as they can, which is good for us shareholders."
Took profit here - there is little upside from here and major potential downside as regulation issues are now filling the rumor mills. Won't be an easy deal to get done. Great profit. Not giving it back. Good luck!

Isn't today (Aug 31) the deadline the STB self imposed to announce a decision on the 'voting trust' issue for CN?
Is Derek a paid actor by CP to undermine sentiment for the CN deal or what is going on here? Wouldn't be surprised by CP to go that low.

What will it go for in buyout? I say 180 to 185 by UNP
"KSU stock is very interesting because its market cap of $20 billion is attractive for takeovers. The management just rejected a bit at $208 which means they believe they can get more. The might get just a bit more from a deal perspective, but they might get much more from a stock price perspective if they keep up the buyback activity. I would say they will sell it for $23 billion but the stock price will be $250. All explained in the KSU stock analysis. https://svencarlin.com/ksu-stock-analysis/"

"Hi folks. Longtime CP shareholder here. Hunter Harrison, and now Keith Creel, have made me a LOT of money (shout out to Bill Ackman for saving the company from the garbage bin in 2011). I can appreciate that some of you might not be happy, and have concerns about the future of the KCS name and its employees. If I were a betting man, I'd wager the HQ of the company eventually ends up back in KC. Not to be glib or insensitive to the great history of KCS, but this outcome was an inevitability. And you have won the merger lottery. CP is the absolute best partner to have, on a very short list of possibilities. Congratulations, welcome aboard, and CPKC is going to do great things for shareholders and for the economy."

"The latest CP merger with KSU will give KSU shareholders 2.884 shares of CP + $90 Cash. Assuming $68/share x 2.884 + 90 = $286/share. Current KSU price is $280/share. I would buy KSU now just because of this and that you would get CP which is a much better railroad system (2000 miles of rail) between US and Canada. Also, CP/KSU merger valued KSU at $300/share... in the short term, this will go up towards that point. These are my thoughts."

"NOTHING BUT UPSIDE- It surprised me that KSU has not rebounded to its pre-Trump level. The only thing working against this stock is fear. The fundamentals are as good as ever, the management is as good as ever, the rail-load prospects are favorable , and if Mr. Trump is to be believed, KSU will benefit from and enjoy increased rail loads with more coal coming out of Wyoming. We should remember that KSU was trading in the high 90s at a time when coal was nearly dead. I took out a large position on this stock. It is my Lock for 2017. Buy it before everyone catches on that the NAFTA nonsense is"

CN is probably just stirring trouble to tempt a higher offer from CP and make it more expensive for them.
"Fun facts, vol. 53: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CP made it's original bid for KSU on March 21. STB upheld the 2001 KSU waiver provision re: CP on Apr. 23STB approved the CP-KSU voting trust format on May 646 days ; 2 critical regulatory decisions completed, both in favor. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CN made its offer on Apr. 20STB ruled AGAINST the 2001 KSU waiver rule re: CN on May 17.STB has NOT yet ruled on the CN-KSU voting trust format. 123 days (and counting); 1 critical regulatory decision completed, in opposition."
"Lets hope the CP deal is the successful (and last) merger bid! Not sure how KSU board ended up losing $1.4B when they received two separate buyout bids from two different railroads that wanted to combine with them! Not sure we shareholders can afford any more of this nonsense? Why would they agree to 'pay off' CNI , when CNI assured them the merger would happen!"
"And on the 133rd day, the STB rested. And saw that it was good."
"As expected, this is all getting more political and less of a decision by STB what should be done for the rail industry in general! Only the politicians know which way it will go?! Either way, KSU shareholders should be just fine? As for KSU and it's employees, not so clear! Best of luck to all stakeholders!"

Good Bye KSU - Riding into the sunset.
"I bought KSU around 2005 @ $25/share, as I expected a take over. It took 15 years for the market to see the opportunity. It's been a good ride, as I multiplied by over 10x my investment. That being said, it would be nice the have a white knight so KSU is fully valued before being taken out. Good bye KSU."
Anyone know WHY the HUGE 5 dollar surge in KSU this morning?? I'm not seeing ANY news to justify it!!
"Jim says ""bye bye"" - Let's see..."
"Great SA article on why KSU is only choice to play this buyout. Great discount on CN if this goes through plus $200 cash. If it doesn’t go thru CP will have to up $275 offer because CN required to pay KSU $1B fee if trust not approved. Add the billion and CP would have to offer $300. Not many win wins in investing but this seems to be one. Personally, I like both CP and CN so happy with shares of either post merger. Think CN gonna get it tho. Happy 4th of July"
"I would just accumulate shares as a long-term investment. It has a certain floor because of the dividend. So, I'd say no matter what happens, it won't drop far below $130... and it could return much higher."

why is tanking?? suppose o be 270.
"This haircut in the KSU stock price makes no sense. Regardless of which company buys KSU, the yield to the stockholders is still significantly above the current price?"
KSU is up 5.63% to 121.00
Kansas City Southern is up 4.92% to 192.46
bye bye
Valued at $275? Can someone explain this?
Any one have an idea what the odds are the CN KSU deal will go through ?
KSU is down 5.62% to 112.00
Hurricane Ida might have something to say.
Remember STB has to approve this acquisition
KSU is up 8.18% to 132.37
Kansas City Southern is up 6.25% to 166.49
"As both a CP and CNR shareholder, I would recommend taking profits for the following reasons:1) Regulators will not approve CNR-KSU in the end2) CP will not raise their bid3) KSU mgmt talked the talk with CP leading me to believe the Board will reject unsolicited offer by CNR.. It is just a matter of time until KSU comes out and rejects CNR’s offer. In my opinion, the synergies proposed by CP are superior to those of CNR and will benefit KSU shareholders over the long haul. The two smallest and most efficient railroads are the best deal for increasing competition amongst L1 railroads."
new offer? stockholders should let the battle continue
Monday markets go boom boom
Whats for sale here?
More than likely this Deal will never go thru. Hasnt been but a few years since they tried to Buy CSX and then NSC. They have ALOT of hurdles to go thru before it will even be feasible. I sold all my KSU stock this morning @257 and a litttle change
"Hello, any reason for the sudden pop this morning?"
"CN begins bargaining off jobs to complete sale. CN is taking on to much debt. CN KCS merger would be a cluster, you know what!"
I am sticking by my 180-185 I have been saying for 3 months...still say UNP too...
"the most recent analyst downgraded the stock after the ""rumor"" came out.. and gave a 162 PT"
KSU is up 6.25% to 116.15
"As a railfan, if the merger does go through I really hope CP lets KSU keep their paint scheme. The engines are much better looking than Norfolk and UNP locomotives. CSX, BNSF, CP, and the previously publicly traded Genesee & Wyoming locomotives."
All I know is that these rich people are making me rich and soon I won’t have to work for them!!

"Under NAFTA, if it was still in place, that agreement would have made it possible for the canadian railroad to operate trains to and from mexico without using U.S crews on the trains. Nafta would have made it possible for the Canadian railroad to entrain sleeper cars within the consist of a freight train utilizing Mexican rail crews to operate the trains to and from Canada. The only requirement would have been that a Mexican engineer would have to have a 'pilot' engineer familiar with the the particular territory he was traveling along with him the first time he traversed that particular main line. After that he'd be gold to travel the 12 hours allowed at any one time trading off with a fellow Mexican engineer who likewise had been approved in the same manner. Don't think this will not happen. It will. In a short time you'll have no American crews on these trains. And the Mexicans will work for cheap. Now that was NAFTA. But I wouldn't be surprised if our new NAFTA style deal doesn't allow it to happen."
Does anyone know if this goes through will it be a forced sale that we will have a taxable event ? Or will we just be issued new shares?
KSU is down 10.23% to 114.55
"Take a look, this company is owned by wall street, that's why its being treated so favorably. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KSU/holders?p=KSURev's are just about flat and earnings are poor. A very expensive stock. https://www.kcsouthern.com/pdf/press-release/Q4+2019+Press+Release.pdf?language_id=1"
I’m fortunate that I bought in at $252.00. I am getting out of this much easier to make money elsewhere without the waiting and wondering

"Does anyone know what is going on with KSU? It crossed 200, and is continuing to hit new highs."
is it to late to buy in
Kansas City Southern is up 5.18% to 194.77
KSU is up 6.57% to 107.15
JP Morgan gave a price target for $275
If CN jumps in this stock will soar
"I could be way wrong, but I figure that the ILWU will put plenty of pressure to kill any merger. Their biggest fear is that ships will dock in Mexico instead of the U.S., and this deal favors docking in Mexico. Those guys have plenty of bucks and political muscle, maybe the most powerful union in the world."
So.....does KSU wait to see if CN is interested in tabling an amended offer? Or does KSU take the $1B and crawl back to CP on its knees?
"""Driverless Tesla Model S crashes in Texas, killing both passengers""Clearly, zombie transport trucks are the imminent, ""next big thing"" that will make the economy really hum along. So just keep blocking those rail mergers, STB.Drive safe, folks...."
$20B bid for a almost $3 B revenue company is very rich. Hope management has shareholders in mind with this rejection.
"I don't know much about buyouts, but if you take the number of shares outstanding, and divide it into the 21 billion rumor, it works out to over $220 a share. I think the action the past few days are the short sellers running to cover, shorting it again, and covering it again."
I bought KSU thinking it would be a take over target my another railroad someday. Now I think KSU may never merge with another class I railroad. UNP owns 26% of Ferromex which probable prohibits them from taking a stake in KSU. BNSF is owned by Berkshire Hathaway. They have plenty of cash to buy out KSU but they will not bid up on anything. NSC and CSX are more likely to be purchased than to be a buyer. Maybe one of the Canadian railroads but i don't know if their regulators would go for it.
