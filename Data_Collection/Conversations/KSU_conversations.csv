"I'm curious what shareholders prefer, a CN or CP deal?"
"Today's selloff appears to be overdone? Feels like STB may not approve CNI deal and someone has leaked some insight? In any case, KSU is worth more than the current trade! IMHO"
"Psssst, Ottensmeyer...your ex-fiance at CN just got the boot. He'll tell everyone at his neighborhood dive bar he's over you, but you know....."
new offer? stockholders should let the battle continue
"As a longtime share holder in KSU I am opposed to the merger with CN. I don't believe it serves the best interest of the KCS especially its employees. The KCS has always been a unique railroad and profitable one despite its small size. A CP merger just make more sense. While the CN offer was higher the CN will be in debt and that is a major concern in the longterm. The CP offer allows growth in both combined railroads so the longterm is bright because there will be fair competition and the railroads can grow and expand. The CN sees that, why do you think the late bid to outdo the CP aggrement to purchase KCS? They see the competion, they know a CP-KCS merger is a threat. So they used their larger buying power to outbid. This is a modern day Morganization of a railroad. They basically can eliminate 30% of the NA rail system. Reason if the KCS-CN merger allowed the CP only alternative move is to be abosorbed by another mega railroad, it has no other choice. Thus CN eliminates its competion, that is Morganization. This is why I highly doubt the STB will approve this merger. I have always respected the KCS management, it has run this railroad the right way over the years. Mike Haverly got the KCS back, he brought on the Souther Belle passenger train, that is pride. Pride means a lot. Pride is good for investors and rail employees. Today I question managements decision here. As I wrote to the KCS board in May just because CN's offer is higher doesn't make it the right decision. They are risking our investments. If they would of accepted the CP merger agreement in which they had a gentlemans agreement on, the KSU stock would be booming by now not dropping. They now risk it even further by awaiting a STB approval to even continue the process. Then what after a year the board can and will in all likelyhood not approve it which will plummet the stock. This is gambling with investor money. You may as well go to the racetrack. They are wasting precious time, the CP merger would of been easily approved and shareholders reward but now you have to wait and hope and you've already seen what has happened to the stock. I can't wait to August to vote my NO to the CN merger, I urge all of you to vote NO, we need to take the CP offer. This is just my opinion but I believe it makes the most sense for longterm investors."
"130 days (and counting) If you were in a casino, and you had your hard-earned money sitting on the table......and the croupier just kept shuffling and shuffling and shuffling the cards, instead of dealing you your hand....at some point you'd get the feeling something's just not right."
Will buyer of KSU also being owner of Panama Canal Railway?
Hurricane Ida might have something to say.
takeover battle over?
"The latest CP merger with KSU will give KSU shareholders 2.884 shares of CP + $90 Cash. Assuming $68/share x 2.884 + 90 = $286/share. Current KSU price is $280/share. I would buy KSU now just because of this and that you would get CP which is a much better railroad system (2000 miles of rail) between US and Canada. Also, CP/KSU merger valued KSU at $300/share... in the short term, this will go up towards that point. These are my thoughts."
"This haircut in the KSU stock price makes no sense. Regardless of which company buys KSU, the yield to the stockholders is still significantly above the current price?"
"Fun fact: That ""Sammas"" yokel has posted 162 comments on Yahoo Finance. ALL of them (before yesterday's insightful addition here) on GE. So....yeah. A real winner."
Isn't today (Aug 31) the deadline the STB self imposed to announce a decision on the 'voting trust' issue for CN?
Cnr was better
"300 proxies for sale. Drop a reply, we can go private."
"Well, it's an ill wind that blows no good. Thanks to KSU accepting the utterly mindless bid of CN, their management is now staring at a shareholder revolt...a pot that had been simmering for quite some time. So...thanks for cranking up that burner. She's boiling now!"
Do any of you work for KSU.......or in the rail industry at all
I knew the STB wouldn't let the CN buy out happen. Competitive disadvantage. Now let's talk to the CP. They will let that by out occur.
"Just spitballing here......What's the chances that CN offer has a quiet little, undisclosed 'understanding' buried inside it ? One that might make the executives at KSU a lot more ""personally"" interested in seeing CN win ?CN would benefit greatly from having current KSU management stick around for awhile during a transition. After all, CN was likely not prepared to do this deal at this time...they were pushed into bidding as a knee-jerk reaction to CP's first move. These CN execs. have no skillset at integration. CN and KSU have very different corp. cultures.....hell, they literally don't even speak the same language! French isn't the 'language of business' anywhere, and certainly not in Mexico! I could easily see CN offering certain KSU executives 2-, 3-, or even 5-year contracts....real lucrative ones.....to stay in their jobs while CN figures out what it has and what it's doing. Such 'deals' don't show up in any transaction documents...if they did, they'd then become awkward and suspect ""conditions""....instead of the standard *wink wink* among greedy, self-serving gentlemen. CP, on the other hand, is (and was) totally up to speed on every detail about KSU. Internally prepared to hit the ground running after the takeover. A culturally much better fit. And Keith Creel's M&A integration hesume is very impressive.....he wouldn't even WANT any holdovers form KSU. At all. So....KSU shareholders might want to keep that in mind when they hear ""their"" management tell them to vote for the CN deal. Best for you? Or for them?"
"To quote a very smart rail CEO from 4 months ago: ""Value not achievable is value not believable"". KSU management was warned. They ignored that advice, turned their back on a solid deal, and hitched YOUR wagon to a pipe dream."
"on October 19 KSU posted a big miss yet stock goes up what's wrong with this , manipulation at its finest."
"I have had a change of mind on KSU. If the board is purchasing shares, which would make it more difficult for anyone to buy the company (hostile or friendly alike). If the railroad wants to add value, perhaps it can find some smaller railroads, whose purchase would expand the reach of KSU, and add to KSU's profits. That would be a win/win situation for the company and the shareholders."
Question.With the CN offer of 33.7 billion and KCS outstanding shares of 90.93 million. That should equal $370.6 per share. Anyone know why KSU is trading way too low for this strong of offer.This has incredible over whelming support. I believe it's going to happen forsure.Please let me know What am I missing?Thank you
So.....does KSU wait to see if CN is interested in tabling an amended offer? Or does KSU take the $1B and crawl back to CP on its knees?
KSU blinks again. Delays vote.
"In as much Mr Elon Musk has aided in the current liquidations,it's unavoidable,the market had it coming,time when traders and investors will be able to contain leverage positions. But considering the fact that crypto is the future it's also inevitable that another speculative growth is coming soon."
"No doubt your self-serving board is on the phne with Blackrock. Trying to scare up a better bid, and saving their own jobs in thep rocess. Just remember this: With Blackrock, or any other private equity buyer, you get your money and you're done. With the CP offer, you would continue to be equity owners......of the best-run, and sole North America-wide railco. Just ask former BNSF shareholders what their biggest regret is. Their cash payout was spent long ago, their dividend checks stopped, and Buffett has laughed all the way to the bank."
"As a railfan, if the merger does go through I really hope CP lets KSU keep their paint scheme. The engines are much better looking than Norfolk and UNP locomotives. CSX, BNSF, CP, and the previously publicly traded Genesee & Wyoming locomotives."
"I am just as happy to take a CP deal for my taxable account. A greater payment in shares (in kind) means less capital gains tax on the cash portion of the transaction. Plus, as KSU is relatively larger in a CP deal when compared to a CNI deal, maybe CP will have more share price upside, post takeover, if they nab KSU."
"Per my previous assertion about deaql values:""......[Corporate Proxy advisory services company] Glass Lewis noted the ""difference between the two offers has narrowed,"" and said ""some investors may consider the CP offer currently has materially greater certainty with respect to regulatory approval, and they may reasonably be of the view that the probability/risk-adjusted values of the CN transaction and current CP proposal are effectively equal at this juncture.""..."
"well KSU shareholders, what ya gonna do? as a pba investor we recently walked away from a deal to buy INTR pipeline and recieved $300m break up fee. Brookfield got the merger but we got cash. Ball is in your court now..."
"CP buys KSU for $ 31 billion ...... !!CP has agreed to acquire KCS in a stock and cash transaction representing an enterprise value of approximately $31 billion, which includes the assumption of $3.8 billion of outstanding KCS debt. The transaction, which has the unanimous support of both boards of directors, values KCS at $300 per share, representing a 34 percent premium, based on the CP closing price on Aug. 9, 2021, the date prior to which CP submitted a revised offer to acquire KCS, and KCS' unaffected closing price on March 19, 2021"

"Dear KSU shareholder:Do you vote yes on a deal that is looking more and more likely doomed to fail?Or do you vote no, and let your Board know that it should turn its attention back to the deal that CAN go through, AND an offer which is now better than the one they they judged was ""fair and full"" to begin with ? Have your say....vote."
"Lets hope the CP deal is the successful (and last) merger bid! Not sure how KSU board ended up losing $1.4B when they received two separate buyout bids from two different railroads that wanted to combine with them! Not sure we shareholders can afford any more of this nonsense? Why would they agree to 'pay off' CNI , when CNI assured them the merger would happen!"
Genese Wyoming was taken private about nine months ago. Always figured KSU would be bought or merged into one of the other railroads at some point most likely BNSF or UNP.
Why would I buy this stock? The company made $1.32 a share last quarter.
Anybody else feel like their being robbed by being forced into business with an inferior company??
"Fun facts, vol. 53: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CP made it's original bid for KSU on March 21. STB upheld the 2001 KSU waiver provision re: CP on Apr. 23STB approved the CP-KSU voting trust format on May 646 days ; 2 critical regulatory decisions completed, both in favor. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CN made its offer on Apr. 20STB ruled AGAINST the 2001 KSU waiver rule re: CN on May 17.STB has NOT yet ruled on the CN-KSU voting trust format. 123 days (and counting); 1 critical regulatory decision completed, in opposition."
Is Derek a paid actor by CP to undermine sentiment for the CN deal or what is going on here? Wouldn't be surprised by CP to go that low.
