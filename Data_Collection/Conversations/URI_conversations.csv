Geez - where is support?
"I love buying cheap stocks, watching them increase quickly by 20% and then still being considered cheap. This is way too cheap still."
Numbers outBeat by .41
URI reaffirms guidance. Will be completing 1.25B repurchase.
"Good news - United confirmed earnings release date and time. When done early, that means good news. If bad news, they would have taken longer to figure it out."
Sure looked like a bottom today. The way it snapped up on such a negative day.
buy at the open cuz this is going up tmrw
the grundle sweat oscillator indicates a short-term oversold condition in URI
"Market makers could be trying to hold it down to expire all options from 150 on up as they all have had heavy volume the last 2 days, then rally it next week. Total manipulation"
"Look, I'll say what I've said before. Great company, great business plan. I am a customer of theirs. That said, THEY NEED TO PAY A DIVIDEND. These 20 and 30 point swings from week to week show their exposure to even the HINT of a slow down. They need a dividend to dull this bouncing as well as pay people (like me!) to wait thru the bad times and be rewarded. Thoughts?"
"RSI got to $80 today. This will pull back to close the $147.17 gap. Blowoff top today. I like this company a lot, however, it will have a 5% pullback off of that $155xx high"
Just added to my position
I guess people have mixed views on earnings? Looked pretty good to me. Good yoy growth
URI business is booming! Great earnings report!It will be green tomorrow. IMO
I have enjoyed the wonderful experience of value appreciation on URI share prices. Especially the SP doubled since the start of the pandemic. It would have been nice to see some dividends as well but no complaints!
"URI hosting analyst week this week, look for a move up on rosy outlook"
"This and HEES (another I follow) being ludicrously punished for uncertain economic outlook. Times are still good (rental rates rising, utilization rates high) while tariff impact is unclear at this point. I am adding to my position at these levels."
Stock always has big gaps up and down. I suspect this will fill the gaps at $154 and $150 in the next couple weeks. Then the other ones below that soon after. Up $25 since filling the gap from $134 in like 10 trading days! Up $10 this week alone but it won’t continue
I really hope this $117-$119 range is the bottom this time so I don't have to liquidate my position.....
Article about huge insider selling. I have sold out but do not see any significant stock price reduction. Anyone?
It's a great company. Indeed!! I will be keep adding it to my portfolio.
@Sherry- so everything you say is true but at some point it has to all be priced in. This company nor any other company is not worth infinity. So at what point is this fully valued? And how do you come to that #?
Really need to keep closing above 123.75 to stay on track for the technical rally that will take URI to the 150's.
"Cup and handle pattern has formed. That usually indicates an uptrend is starting. Surprisingly decent construction numbers yesterday is a tailwind. Although this stock has slid the last few weeks, I opine it has reversed and will start its upward trend. Not huge daily gains, just slow and steady like a leader in a mature industry. I plan on riding this up to earnings release before reevaluating."
Up 15 points easy thurs/fri
https://discord.gg/emdwPmNN
When is the earnings released?I see analyst have average price of 172
LOVE this stock.....still so undervalued and that after a huge run up over the last month. Timing is everything....
"Who has this as a top holding? It is my 2nd largest behind CVS, bought in Dec then more in early February. Expecting to get out anywhere in the 200s if it has become a long term gain. Just rooting for EPS of 20 in 2019 with any PE over 10 to make me very happy on this holding."
This happened last quarter. Immediate selloff in the morning then climbed the rest of the day. I am going to buy and take the same ride again for a day trade.
Priced for a $7.75 move... lets hope it stays well within that range.
"The low ""Float"" can give you big swings in stock price, but they had great numbers in a tough quarter, the next quarter should be a block buster!!"
"I have seen nothing on these posts that would call for the beating that this one got today. I even listened to and read the conference call. I must say that the conference call was rather confusing, but all in all it is still an earning beat, revenue beat and guide higher. How in sam hell can this happen? What am I missing?? They started the call of by saying they had another ""strong quarter""."
"Sadly this can't break or even hold 158. This is the third time with in the past month or so. Though it would pop but down again as of now. We need something from mgmt. to make this pop and get rid of the shorts, and hedge funds."
"I recommend caution today. Tuesday, October, 2019, green pre-market. Reminds me of the opening scene from Jaws."
"Turn is in process, time to back up the truck"
Congrats to all who knew this was undervalued and uri would continue to perform
160’s coming
This is way under valued. Look the PE ration and earning per share.
"No worries. The earnings look good. Any further price cuts would because of the small increase in revenue and slow growth outlook. But the stock is still undervalued, look at the latest CFRA charts."
Construction still goes on even during COVID-19 times for URI and other construction equipment companies. URI and HEES are oversold.Watch for MASSIVE rebound on earnings and a catapult up afterwards after signing of $2T infrastructure bill!
"United Rentals resumed with a Hold at Deutsche Bank analyst Chad Dillard resumed coverage of United Rentals with a Hold rating and $158 price target. Since late cycle concerns took hold in April, the Machinery sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by 15% and is approaching valuation lows last seen during the 2015 energy and 2008 global financial crises, Dillard tells investors in a research note. He resumed coverage of eight stocks in the Machinery sector, with two Buy ratings, one Sell rating and five Holds.So URI is approaching valuation lows and this analyst now puts the infamous Hold. Where was he when the stock was 40% higher."
I should add this is my lottery ticket to buying a South Beach condo if it hits 300-400 in the next 3 years.
"I think URI would not test the 180.00 to 190.00 level until infrastructure is in the government agenda. Fundamentals in URI is great, and with increased income caused by hurricane Florence and increased construction in California due to the wildfires this company should not have drop ten points due to the acquisition. Hope 160.00 hold and we get a great earning report on the 16th of this month. Does anyone have another idea?"
Largely discounting a recession at these prices IMO. Seems like URI has been over-penalized over global macro concerns given its largely domestic exposure.
I am asking a question and don't understand why it keeps getting deleted?
Any thoughts on why this dropped in AHs? Looks like all positive news.. and appropriate/conservative guidance
I take it they buyback 8% of the shares in 2019 to finish off the buyback. Usually the analyst are hesitant to put buybacks in EPS estimates meaning they could earn $20 in 2019 even a 12 PE would put it at 240 and make this a 12 month double.
"URI hit a major air pocket the last few sessions but the drop is overdone.With lower interest rates and no China revenue, you would think URI is in good shape. The latest proposed round of tariffs is largely consumer based, not impacting most of URI's capex, making the latest price decline even more confusing. The issue I see is that URI seems to be viewed as a proxy for cyclical stocks, so if the economy is seen heading down, then the cylicals will get hurt. URI's guide down from the last earnings call doesn't help either.The reality is that construction can be delayed but it doesn't go away. URI will get past this air pocket and that initial turnaround will likely be explosive. It is more of a buying opportunity for strong holders than a reason to sell."
"Market on the rise, pre-hours. That is good news for URI."
"looks like it's setting up a base to the uptrend, TA has it going to mid $170's-$180."
Even Cramer thinks it’s cheap telling people to sell Caterpillar and move into United Rentals stock
"Unless people believe economic meltdown is imminent, this is very cheap at these levels. And if you believe meltdown is imminent, you shouldn't really be in any stocks. Seems like a screaming buy?"
"Hit $130 today, which means $150 is not a puppy dream"
HRI hardly downMight be fund that got crushed on AMZN and TSLA sold their winner in URI to cover margin
"It’s hard to say, this went down to 90$ with the panic in December. Then the worry was that high rates will make it hard to handle its debt load."
Raises outlook and stock drops?
"PE of 10 and Infrastructure bill, seems to be a no brainer so what am I missing?"
https://stocktwits.com/Jockne40/message/254454829
2018 expected EPS=$14.9 P/E=15 Target Price = $223 by the end of the year. 31% upside.
way way oversold
"URI beat on every measure, and raised guidance. And the stock is down, don't figure. I'm sure some wonder boy money runner is behind this insane action. He more then likely can't balance his check book.Hope the CC tomorrow fixes this mess!"
This should $142-$178 - what gives? How long until that happens you figure?
Fastenal results give me pause here about buying before earnings
"Why is this off AH? News? This company has a long way to go before it's ""expensive."""
Careful. Profits will be taken at $130.
It is frustrating following J Cramer advice and see the stock going lower like this. But I’ll not sell ! I’ll wait for the short to cover (3 Days ) max and see what happen. Stay calm
Macquarie target now $99 - means it will trade between $80 & $90 ??? Cramer REALLY messed up here.
$URI Real nice earnings. Long and strong from $100. Not worried one bit.
Businesses are mostly shuttered until June. Listen to the earnings calls. Too much uncertainty and to little consumerism!
Opening gap up filledTime to buy
"If previous trading patterns hold, we are about 8 points away from a V shaped bottom back to 130."
"Folks URI had a great quarter even with ""Bad Weather"" all over the east cost and else where. This quarter coming up is their strongest part of the year, and there is a huge ""Backlog of work""!! I know we are trying to build a house and the contractors are 4 months behind because of the ""Rain"", they can't pour concrete to get started. At some point weather is going to go back to normal and these guys are going to bust as hell!! Going higher, take it to the Bank!!Good luck to all longs!!"
"""...the company also repurchased $420 million of common stock under its current $1.25 billion repurchase program, reducing its diluted share count by 2.1%.

"what is the big concern? there is no reason for this stock to drop below 120. barring a halt in Nationwide commercial construction, this is way indervalued"
This should be at $130s. Way overvalued and traded higher last week for no reason. Several business outlets pointed out URI as overvalued when it went higher last week. Good time to short.
might make a new support area today above $137. we've been hovering at $135 for quite a while
i think we will reach 245 the first week of december i have 125 shares long at the moment
Anyone buying at this level (127)?
"When the infrastructure package goes through, this will fly within 7 days!"
"Maybe the problem is organic revenue growth, absent the Baker acquisition, is viewed as being light based on expectations."
jumped in at $130 then more at $119 to average out.....
"Don't be patient. Take this drop/gift of 150.00 and buy. I picked up 3,000 more after hours. URI is the top company in an industry with a tremendous outlook."
"BTW, URI P/E may look good now, but wait until we seen earnings!"
Bought in today @ $153 when URI got my attention. Now we need Trump to announce his much ranted about infrastructure build-out. An oil price hike wouldn't hurt things for URI either. Wish we'd get off the illegal immigrants kids news rant.
"Infrastructure bill coming, guidance raised. Seems like an overreaction."
nice
"Just received a Jefferies report from my broker, they have a @10 price target and a lot of good comments about their earnings report!!"
"On Thursday the man on ""Fast Money"" recommended URI, saying it would go to 190. It was down the next day, and it's only up 50 cents in a good day today. Goes to show how much they know."
"#uri What are we expecting for Q2 revenues and earnings, they likely will be down, what are analysts expecting and any potential for a beat? Should I sell now into strength, or hold?￼"
Crushed Earns Beat by .82 EPS and Beat revs by $50M
Wouldn't surprise me if some conglomerate offered a bid to take this private. Something like $175.00would make sense. Way too cheap as she trades today.
URI has managed to close above the 111 head and shoulders neckline now for the last 3 sessions. The next hurdle is to break above the downtrend line in place for the last year. That will happen around 123. A close above 123 that is held could signal a move up to at least 153.
The 7% of short positions will scramble to cover tomorrow. Good to be long!
Can someone explain how the enterprise value is calculated by Yahoo Finance? I ask because for URI their is a tremendous difference between enterprise value and market capitalization. One would believe the difference supports the hypothesis that this stock is extremely cheap right now.
"Folks this Tariff stuff is far from over and United Rentals is a ""Tariff proof stock"" and ""China Proof"".With steel prices going up maybe by 25% thanks to Tariffs building contractors will be renting more heavy equipment as the added cost for a mid size Bulldozer will go up by $120,000 for a new one. Heavy Equipment is just a big lump of heavy steel.Tariffs will hurt the sales of all heavy equipment, so the next best thing ""Rent the stuff"". And wait for the tariffs to go away and that could take years!! By the way construction is booming and we are in the sweet spot of good weather for the next 6 months. For sure 2 good earnings report by then!! This stock is a no brainer!!"
"Nice upward momentum for uri during down day for market. Investors want in for er next week. Uri has a tendency over last 4 quarters at least to beat. Expanding profit and stock buyback should make eps increase nicely and bring in new money. The charts show a cup and handle, spike above 50 dma and coming 50/200 golden cross. We have a real gem in the works"
"looks like they either beat or missed depending on the accounting method used... Fidelity shows an 8 cent miss, but all articles show a beat!"
"URI has formed a head and shoulders pattern. The question now is whether it will go lower like the typical result of a head and shoulders pattern. Volume is very low, so nothing is guaranteed, but if it does, we could see stock price dive down 105. The good news is that should this happen, a buying opportunity occurs when the price moves back up above the 111 neckline, and the target price could then go to 148."
Deal or No Deal URI @ $108.00?
anyone have an explanation?
Huge accretive merger announcement this morning!
expect a beat on revenue and earnings. Guidance should also look good.
URI always trims this quarter just a hair in case of hurricanes in third quarter
"It’s a meltdown, there is an entry point somewhere down here."
Numbers I see look great don't figure on price action. I can't find what the problem would be. Tomorrow they do the Conference call. Should pop back up!!
"If equipment is going to be more expensive because of tariffs, won't more people be renting."
"This is just too funny. The company beats top and bottom line, also reports a great guidance and then the stock looses 12%!!!!This is shorts playing it. Just bought 3000 shares. The shorts will need to cover soon before close."
URI would be good buyout target for foreign equipment maker wanting into US market for equipment leasing and sales. Stock way too cheap
"Just a heads up for anyone looking at the financials on yahoo. EBITDA shown on yahoo is after deducting for rental fleet depreciation. So it's not the same EBITDA that analysts look at (which adds back rental fleet depreciation). For 2019 analysts are projecting EBITDA of $4.4 billion (vs the $2.5 billion or so on this site). In addition, if you look at the valuation on yahoo (8.6x LTM EBITDA), it's really a free cash flow multiple because again it includes rental fleet depreciation as a cash expense."
Nice reports .50 increase in EPS 
"Insider Selling at United Rentals (URI) Continues with Significant SaleDecember 18, 201910:18 PM ETPublished December 18, 2019 10:18 PM Eastern TimeMT Newswires10:18 PM EST, 12/18/2019 (MT Newswires) -- There was a significant sale of shares of United Rentals by an insider today, as revealed in a form 4 document filed with the SEC.

Would you sell now or hold on and ride it out?
Long time holder of URI. This stock usually moves up anytime there is a natural disaster. URI benefits fron all the rebuilding of homes and infrastructure. Not the reason i bought this stock. Just my observation from owning URI long term.
"Stock price is heavily influenced by institutional holders, I look for them to come in and buy on any weakness here"
United Rentals reached an all time high at 252.35
I live right next to this company sad I'm broke to afford a share
"The infrastructure bill has bipartisan support, especially the ""real"" infrastructure part, like roads, bridges, etc...That is where URI comes to play, not on the ""social"" infrastructure side. The democrats might force the full bill through anyways this month. If they fail, the ""partial"" bill will go through early next month, with much the same financial benefits for URI anyways!I hope all you shorts have this in mind as well..."
"The company should be trading at least close to that of CAT's PE. Even if it trades at PE of 9 the stock price should be well above 165. Short of severe economic downturn or geo political turmoil, the stock should have very little downside and significant upside (also management reaffirmed financials per recent earnings conference call)."
"A copy and paste from a UBS report, on July 12th....United Rentals, IncURI looks attractive post-BakerCorp & pre-Q2;Reiterate Buy $196 target price.URI still has capacity to do more deals; Buy thesis intactWe upgraded URI to Buy on 6/22 as we believe the stock selloff since URI’s Q1 earningsreport is overdone (down ~16% vs. S&P down ~3%). Our Buy thesis reflects ourexpectations for continued end market strength and improved margins with inorganicgrowth and capital deployment driving EBITDA upside. The $715m BakerCorpacquisition that URI announced on 7/2 is consistent with our thesis, and we expectadditional deals over the next 18 months"
$KPLT is the massive opportunity in this space. Partnerships with $AFRM and $APPL. Trading at 70% discount because of small miss of Q2 targets. Huge rebound potential. Much better P/E ratio then $PRG $URI $AER $AL or $RCII
"In 2008, rental companies were hit hard by the economic downturn and lack of construction. These companies are a first indicator of clouds on the horizon."
Earning calls are not usually positive for URI stock price initially. Stock is performing like it did a year ago. Many people have owned the stock along time and they want to take some profits. I think we will be up over 170. This year and probably even higher.
Finally a breakout above 154. It would be nice to see more volume.
Beats by .23 even with an debt adjustment of .30Revenue beat by 20 millionAll great numbers
Be patient
"Whats with this action down $3 bucks?? They report earnings this week. Expected to be good or what is going on???This sign seems counter to what the ""Analyst"" and sooth sayers have been preaching.Any news out there today??"
"Well once again they beat earnings this makes 4 beats in a row; what does it take to prove the bashers are wrong??Great numbers, lets hope some two bit negative so called Analyst doesn't cry like a baby because he is short.Also I notice someone at Yahoo changed their numbers on the EPS just a few hours ago. When they announced the numbers the EPS yahoo showed was a much lower EPS, wonder who paid for that tactic. So, they make up numbers after the earnings.This good well run company gets less respect then Rodney Dangerfield!!Lets hope their hard work and good management gets paid off!"
Buy at 94... you’ll thank me later!
$500 if the DEMS win...
"Expecting good results from URI the rest of the year. Second quarter headwinds, Blueline integration and bad weather, should be made up in second half of year. Those issues do not reduce demand, only delay it. Third quarter will likely be blowout. MGMT did on the call what good MGMT does, underpromise so they have a cushion to overdeliver in the future."
"I wanted to raise cash yesterday and was thinking of selling because this has been a loser for me, great mgmt, cheap PE, but still a loser. First the market hated its debt when rates were to increase last year, then it's the threat of a construction play in a recession, this stock selling off daily. But I just couldn't dump it. I bought right after Trump elected at $84. I look at the valuation and listen to Buffet on moats and understandable models, on his recent multi billion acquisition that didn't happen and think this is his kind of investment...so why not mine? Yes, big under performance...in price, not mgmt. Watch them turn to stock price and mitigate that next. I'm NOT selling this cheap. We're easily $50 undervalued even with small recession, even without infrastructure legislation."
This stock so sensitive to tariffs. Not sure why it should be more sensitive than any other sector that imports from China.
170’s next target
"Too many investors have tunnel vision for tech stocks. Well, sometimes the smart money finds real value with old style blue collar apparatuses. URI is ridiculously oversold."
Added 10% to my position at $125 today. Love this stock...
"Morgan Stanley has a buy on URI with a price target of $175. In contrast, look up the Maquarie analyst on TipRanks. He has a 27% success rate, an avg return of -12.3% and is ranked 4,627 out of 4,912 and has a star rating of 1/4 of a star out of 5. So I'm not surprised that he is (or will be ) all wrong about URI."
$5.96 v. 5.53 24% higher growth and 17.6% higher revenue $2.49 billion
I want to know who is the analyst that has a $46.00 price target on URI.
"$hees Losing patience. What should I do with my long shares? Hold and wait for better days even though the stock trades poorly, hold and sell covered calls (is there really any decent money to be made; plz share sample call trades), exchange for $uri or $spy?"
With latest acquisition done in cash and likely accretive to earnings and company maintaining its stock buyback along with looking for more acquisitions we should see major beat and increasing earnings forecast. With earnings of 17.00 stock should be in minimum 170’s
Always intrigues me how two analysts who are supposedly looking at the same facts can be at such polar opposites. Jefferies upgrade this morning to $165 while UBS downgrades to $118. They will probably have good quarterly numbers but the fixation will be on the full year and future outlook. I'm long but not surprised if they temper expectations due to not knowing where the economy is going right now.
"URI is within a sweet spot with today's economy. Many firms are not willing to make capital expenditures with new equipment. However, will lease in a heart beat if more equipment is needed."
Smaller cap stock. Subject to games by hedge funds and others.
Why is it down
https://www.unitedrentals.com/our-company/press-room/press-releases/detail/united-rentals-announces-first-quarter-2019-results#/
I guess I am holding long term already down 20/share.
This quarter URI is set up the opposite that it was last quarter. Last quarter stock was setting at high end running up into earnings and even though they beat big it dropped like a rock. This time around it’s setting at lows and will beat big again. I’m expecting the opposite to happen with a huge rally up on earnings
Anyone do the math on the refinance? The net benefit eps?
This is a sleeper About ready to take off.
Touched moving average and backed offLook for another run at it
"I’m a long term investor of URI. URI is a well run company, in fact the new CEO is the best pure rental guy they’ve ever had. They made smart moves and developed deep relationships during 2008 when it went down the tubes. The rental business is a fantastic business and URI have the best people in the business. I’ve owned this stock at $8 a share and to see it now at $300.!!"
Watch stock open up strong tomorrow
"Maquarie cut target price to $99. I am a gluttton for punisment, as I just purchased URZi stock for the very first time."
GREAT BEAT!!!! Report is out! Income $4.72 Vs. $4.25
This stock should be $165 for fun!!
Lots of tax noise in the numbers - real results a problem?
This stock is like Rodney Dangerfield... it gets no respect!!
Have said for years that it's a total waste of capital to but back shares. All they're doing is making it easier to beat and inflate EPS. Think about all the buying of shares then months later the share price is less than when shares were purchased. This is why you have to look at gross revenues. Sometimes companies will not recognize a sale until the quarter they wish to.
Looking for a continued run up toward April 18th call.
110 buy number hit. make the purchase
"I am surprised by the drop as well considering the results and the slightly upbeat forecast. But it could be because of the 8K that just posted....they talk about the BlueLine acquisition for $2.1BILLION...of which $1.0BILLION will be with a term load....and the balance of $1.1BILLION ""with other Debt instruments""....the market could be fearful that this is all with newly issued shares of stock resulting in dilution....though the additive earnings should offset some of that... otherwise, I have no clue as to why the drop"
50 day SMAVG dropped below the 200 day SMAVG. I can’t find any other news to understand this drop. Also a huge increase in volume at the close on friday. People selling off of the gains earlier in the day and continues into monday. This stocks is completely UNDERVALUED. Look at the metrics even compared to its competitors. So cheap at this price
William are you okay ..
Watch for upgrade to buy here in next days as we go into earnings which will blowout estimates again. 160’s
"Unless you know that performance at expectations and outlook raised, you wouldn’t invest in this stock right before ER. So keep you eyes open for late volume."
"URI surpassed 2 big hurdles, closing above the 111 head and shoulders neckline and above the 1 year downtrend line at 123.Should those hold, the next hurdle is to close above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from the December to May run, that target is around 133. The trajectory to 153 remains intact."
Bears trying to shake out the weaklings then come in at a better price when the BULLS wake up in the morning.
URI is a leading indicator stock and the dominant trend now is DOWN. Funds are embracing this concept.
Looks like a beat on Rev and EPS to me. Why the selling?
Still need a dividend from this one. 5 yrs ago we were at this exact same spot. Not a friendly long term investment
"great presentation....with great guidance....this stock is so oversold...Co sees FY18 (Dec) revs of $7.89-7.99 bln vs. $7.96 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; adj EBITDA of $3.815-3.865 bln and sees FY19 (Dec) revs of $9.15-9.55 mln vs. $9.15 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus; adj EBITDA of $4.35-4.55 blnAdditionally, the company announced that it will resume its $1.25 billion share repurchase program this month. The program was initiated in July 2018, with approximately $210 million of shares purchased through September 30, 2018. The Company subsequently paused the program on November 1, 2018 to focus on the integration of the BlueLine acquisition. The company intends to complete the program by the end of 2019."
Downgrades to follow.. chart overextended.. pullback to 135 area coming shortly.
"As usual, the market favors industry leaders that have invested wisely in growth. Tangible assets + strong cash flow + smart acquisitions + growing profitability + stock buyback = 160+ this year."
"Tax bill a huge plus. They will pay less since their reported tax rate is 30%+, but more important with 100% first year writeoff of equipment purchases the company probably will pay minimal cash taxes for at least the next five years. Look for higher dividends, more stock buybacks, debt reduction, and acquisitions which will not require debt or stock issuance."
"It is now becoming clear why a large fraction of minorities and low income people are reporting that they won't get the vaccine. By continuing the COVID crisis, they are getting free-rent. It is legalized stealing that a short-sighted government encourages. It buys a large number of votes because there are far more freeloader renters than there are landlords. The dem party is manipulative a travesty."
Here we go boys.... The drop was all manipulation! This will be green soon and will jump BIG tomorrow!
Cramer recommending buying URI tonight
Crazy this is so cheap todayUndervalued on many levels
Cramer likes rental stocks.URI has much lower PE ratio than HRI
this will be up tomorrow
"This is one of greatest equity stories out there. Huge catalyst with infrastructure bill, fragmented industry with a double-digit CAGR where they are the largest player with ~13% mkt shr, still extremely undervalued considering how much cash flow they generate. Not selling until they dominate the space."
Down to a 6 PE on this year's earnings. A bounce to an 8 PE would take this to almost $130. Even if the bear market contunues that kind of bear market rally seems likely.
"Heavy call buying in Jan calls, we’re heading up next"
HRI earnings were pretty impressive. Hard to see how URI misses?
URI. Well run company. Hoping for a dip so I can buy it back. Stock often moves independently of company performance.
"Conference call starts now if I looked at the news right!!!Ok, guys time to add some bright shiny color to these great Earnings."
"If they can survive their massive debt load, their product should be in great demand. Companies will not be buying anything new in capex as it will hurt their balance sheets more than they already are."
The stock trades at just about 9 times it's expected earning...what a bargain...I can see smart money managers picking this up soon.
"under the circumstances.. this report is stellar. I would think that they will hold their own in the current environment.. work will get done. bizzes will put off cap equipment purchases and favor rentals, imo.. if large scale govt projects are done to reign in unemployment, uri will benefit as well.. this could be their low point for the yr.. q wise"
"The trim on revenue guidance is a rounding error! Just a slight change on upper end, doesn’t justify the drop"
Upgrade out this morning to buy and 180 target
"this stock is a major holding for me. Its at the right spot on the charts and just getting hurt with the transport etf,s selling off"
Likely a big beat in earnings this quarter and big jump up
"Despite solid growth in earnings and revenue yoy,stock is down after hours. However, 2.488 billion in revenue vs 2.5 billion estimate, and $5.96 per share net income vs expectations of $5.46.The problem may be that the traders saw the 5.08 earnings per share, but that is after taking a reserve of 119 million for income taxes. So, should the 5.46 analyst estimate be compared to the 5.08 which has the taxes provisioned, or the 5.96 without the tax provision?"
Closing in a week. It’s been a nice run but I found a better company.
"If the market slows, they will slow down Capex and as a result generate tons of free cash flow. It's one of the odd things about these businesses - they generate lots of cash in the down market and in the up market they tend to expand the fleet."
Surprised to see this down today
I didn't see this coming today (Friday). Especially with no news and after what it did yesterday....ugh
Super heavy call volume again today on options up to 160’s for this week
"Guess that Macquarie no name guy was right. We are almost at $99. Once we get there, he'll probably but a BUY and $150 target on the stock."
Cramer recommended URI ????
My friend works with them and mention they merged/ took over another company and used up some capital. he said it will come back soon
Numbers forecast are stellar
Hold or sell?
"I don't have a position in URI right now, but I'm trying to find future opportunities. I think the credit markets are going to fall apart. Many companies that are highly levered will have terrible debt/equity , interest coverage and current ratios which makes it next to impossible to get bonds through or loans from banks. I think URI is a direct beneficiary in the years to come. Not sure I want to catch any falling knife right now, but food for thought in the weeks and months to come."
Target price Jefferies had is $210. slip of the key board.
Good or bad restructuring of debt?
Who is selling ? Company offered 1+ buyback. Must be option traders manipulating the share prices.
How does a co make a billion pay no dividend and net book value go down. Interesting
$170 looked so pretty lol casualty of a Trump tweet ...market instantly lost 100 points
Can't believe the market maker can't keep the stock flat
Karen Finerman of CNBC Fast Money show talked about URI being way oversold tonight.
Given that we had outside interest in URI we should continue to see share price growth. Target at $150!
buy buy buy the dip.this stock has a good runway for at least 1year
"Why is no one on this board? Overreaction in the market today. Infrastructure stimulus will come, eventually."
"I'm a technical trader, 25yrs experience, This is EXTEREMLY oversold. It's going to bounce minimum back to 130 fast in next day or two."
URI a stock to buy in the 70s and look a year from now at very nice gains.
Come on baby - break $118 by Tuesday...and stay above $111 today
Chart shows nice inverse bottom or W bottom formedAll bullish
"I assume the drop is for the loan to make the resent Buy-out they just did.To buy BlueLine Rental in a cash deal valued at $2.1 billion from private-equity firm Platinum Equity. It was a cash deal, so it makes sense they would need to get a loan for the deal!The street loved the buy-out they made, so, looks like much to do about nothing!!"
"great business model, decent valuation, construction spending still going strong. Points to a buy!!!"
"If Dems win the house, infrastructure bill becomes even more likely? They will want to find an area to work together."
medium term target 150
in at 112 and change....have ridden this down to this point. Looking to add now any info you may have would be appreciated. Only thing I see is China trade delays. Am I missing something.
looks like team grundle is on board
bottom was 145.45. Here we go.
my company was one of first acquisitions in 1998 and we got URI stock at 37 dollars a share LOL thanks
Within an hour of each other Goldman Sachs upgrades from neutral to buy and previous Zacks downgrades from hold to sell
We will look back on this as a gift- very happy to get in under $100. This is a quality company and great value here
Stay long. this should trend toward 168 over the next quarter. Should fare better than the broader market through trade war.
Problem is no dividend.
Moving up in AH 156.32
#URI overreacting every time when market is down!
Why no dividends from a mature company that generates $3.5 billion of cashflow annually? I don't trust the management or BoD of this company.
URI buying back 10% of its shares in buyback with its excessive free cash flow should rally this back to highs. HRI a competitor is only off its high by 10.00 where URI is off its high by 37.00
The other comment I would make reiterates something already said on this board: a beta of 2.6 and being held in portfolio of index funds makes URI a stinker. A dividend would help!
"Down almost 7%, overall market down 2%. That's what they call Beta. Takes a strong stomach this one."
"great earnings report, good luck all. reaffirmed 2019 as well. let's take a ride up!"
My question is if they pay no dividend and have no share buy back plan. What are they doing with all the money they are making.
The company will be optimistic about forward earnings as they just bought out a big company and don’t want to sound like they bought at top
URI had really good earnings and now this drop on no news. The weakness makes no sense.Solid business with a beat on EPS and raised outlook!! A real puzzle??
Didn't it do this last ER in July? I seem to recall it being down similarly in after hours trading back then and when it opened in the morning it was up rather well.
Looks like the MM's trying to pin $120. Lots of calls & puts options at $120.
huge beat 
"Upgrade out by UBS on URI:United Rentals – The equipment rental company was upgraded to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" at UBS, which said cyclical and cost concerns surrounding the company are overdone."
"What's controlling this market are logarithm computer programs. Stocks not in the foreseen right at the moment hot sectors are getting crushed. Balance sheets of really good companies like URI are being ignored and treated like value traps. Well, this too shall pass. Many firms are not willing to buy new with capital expenditures with looming economic slowdown but will lease in a heart beat."
$11.0 BILLION in debt. $60M in cash. Approx. $600M a year in interest expenses. No debt maturities in the near term which seems to be the best thing you can say about their current financial situation. A lot of debt and hardly any cash. Anyone know what kind of discount the bonds are trading at???
Finally well deserved...great value play ...more buy backs coming soon
"So if you look a the charts, this stock is tracking $CAT which is WRONG because its business is basically the same as $URI and $HRI. Will be corrected at some point."
URI will recover as well as its founder Bradly Jacobs new venture XPO. Both good opportunities.
and now we r green. all is right with the world
Right on longs lets smash through that $160 level ...yet another great acquisition
Market coming up quickly only less than 100 now
This closed on October 8th at 109.20 I think the right thing for the analyst to do is say well if it goes to 150.17 by Nov 8th the time will be right to upgrade the stock. Please explain under what universe this is a better value up 40% in 1 month.
"Dropping 5.5%, no news, why? Anybody knows?"
What’s up with after Mkt price drop!!??
super cyclical but also super cheap. my grundle is sweaty with excitement
"4 investment firms (Stifel, Merrill Lynch, CFRA, and UBS) reiterated a Buy on URI today with price targets in the range of 150-180. I don't see any downgrades. Conference call was generally very positive."
"Anyone else excited for earnings ? $160 in a week ,$170’s in a couple months ...let’s go people"
