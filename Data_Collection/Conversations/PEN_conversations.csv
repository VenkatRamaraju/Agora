Why on Earth would you guys listened to a party that has interest in shorting the stock? If they don't make the money when the stock drop then might give them some credit. Look at ENPH a few month ago... and look at where it is today.

"I think the last few hours before Christmas and low volume evaporated the support and resolve of some owners of this stock. I suspect the options volume for puts and calls over some clues but the end of the quarter the major holders will report their ownership updates. will be interesting to see if positions by some holders have increased or decreased, and if there is an increase in option activity for the large owners."

This stock is solid! it's a bargain at this price imo.
PEN is up 6.20% to $123.02
How does a company growing at 2 to 3% a year that just had it's flagship product recalled and which will soon be hit with dozens of wrongful death suits (their product liability insurance is probably void due to fraud) and which will have a lot of trouble getting anything through FDA in the future (because of the fraud) rate a PE near infinity?
This sure is a quiet board. I'll be watching (maybe the only one here) but had to jump off this rocket at 153. Not for any good reason...and now it's up another 0.50. With such low volume and no news - maybe it was insider buying. Which argues against a buyout but we'll see. Good luck to anyone still on the ride here.

"if you are in this company, get out, big litigation coming against them, it isn't going to be good for this company."
It is selling off gradually with low volume. Not much support but enough interest from small retail buyers willing to cash in a few dollar rise. don't think we will se a collapse for a week or so but looks likely given the company's silence. This seems to easy not to address the concerns directly and very dangerous given the holiday season.

After reviewing all the evidence of the short seller PEN looks like it is going down the path of a complete Fraud stock. My bet is this moves 10 to 20% down in the morning! The Media is going to have a field day with this story and Wall Street doesn't like healthcare companies that kill people.

"Penumbra confirmed this morning using the named ""Antik Bose"". ""Penumbra confirms the papers rumored to be attributed to Antik Bose are in fact attributed to Dr. Arani Bose."" Why wouldn't they just say the author was Arani Bose? Why insert this Antik fake character with the fake pictures? They then said in the next sentence in the press release, ""To imply that Dr. Arani Bose's peer-reviewed research, co-authored with a large cohort of his peers, was ever or would ever be attributed to anyone other than Dr. Arani Bose is inaccurate and conspiratorial."" That sure doesn't make any sense. Again, why this Antik character. It's all very fishy."

MAUDE Database Death ReportsThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database has already listed 12 entries of deaths occurring in 2019 and 2020 where individuals suffered from harm after operations involving the JET 7 Xtra Flex catheter. The MAUDE database reported that these complications occurred as a result of either the catheter expanding or the device’s distal tip fracturing. Eight of the 12 death reports mentioned that at least one arterial rupture occurred. Many of the arterial ruptures that occurred were in the internal carotid artery which provides blood to the brain and eyes. Found this posted but cannot find MAUDE data base? Can anyone help? Update?

"Anyone pay any attention to PEN? One of my fav med devide plays...::Penumbra ($PEN), one of the top devicemaker IPOs last year, unveiled its latest thrombectomy product to the U.S. market.Dubbed the ACE 68 Reperfusion Catheter, the vascular device uses the latest tracking technology to extract blood clots in acute ischemic stroke patients more quickly and safely, the company said. The device, which is part of the company’s Penumbra System, was designed with a new tracking platform from hub to tip, and features a unique coil winding geometry along 16 transitions to deliver an optimal tracking profile.The announcement, along with supporting data, was made Monday at the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery’s 13th Annual Meeting in Boston.“The ACE68 provides an opportunity to reverse strokes faster and with less expense,” Dr. Adam Arthur, a professor in the neurosurgery department at the Semmes-Murphey Neurologic & Spine Institute in Memphis, TN, said in a statement. “The larger lumen seems to allow better clot capture, which may reduce the need for adjunctive devices, simplify the procedure and reduce procedure cost-- important considerations as hospitals look to expand stroke services.”"

"I actually read the report and I have NO position but wish I did now... I've never seen a situation where there can be no 'grey'.

"I was reviewing the institutional ownership and there are a lot of institutions that opened a position above this price. Now I don’t think they will sell at a lost instead they will likely average down on this dip. I’m not sure how long the recovery will take but from looking at earnings I can see exponential growth and solid long term fundamentals. They beat earnings delivering .15 vs .03. They also RAISED their outlook/guidance for 2018. And they increased their margin 270-basis pints year-over-year. I also see that they have no debt; therefore they shouldn’t have any solvency issues. And lastly they added to their cash equivalents (now at $57.9 million). This was a great quarter for them. By the way 70% institutional ownership means that institutions are the ones who decide on the PPS. It is very possible that an institution(s) sold blocks of shares at a discount to another institution(s) and caused some algorithmic selling. All in all, I think this dip is a bit oversold. The RSI on the hour chart is oversold, but the RSI on the daily tick chart is 36.15 which is slightly above oversold (has to be under 30). I got in near 125. If it drops more I will likely to add to my position."

"The company never really answered the basic charge that their product is dangerous and should be recalled.Neither in their written response or in the Bank Of America interview.I think it was a mistake to go after the fake persona and research material because it muddied the water on a charge that is pretty straight forward and important.The company decided to spend all their time answering the fake persona charge which they acknowledged was true.They still have not answered why they have not recalled the product.It apparently is banned in Japan and Europe.So, it seems there is something to the claim."

"Quintessential is trying to convince you that all the peer-reviewed papers with ""A Bose"" listed as an author is a fake internet profile Ankit Bose and not Arani Bose the real Chief Innovator/Co-Founder of Penumbra. If you search on pubmed (pubmed.gov, the gold standard in biomedical search engine) Arani Bose you will see legitimate articles listing A Bose as an author. If you search Ankit Bose you get nothing. There are zero articles published by the fake persona. Quintessential is so ignorant and/or unethical that they are using Researchgate (a commercial social networking site no legitimate scientist in the world uses) to investigate. Anyone can create a profile on researchgate which is exactly what the fake Ankit Bose did. Quintessential is the only person in the world being duped by this fake Ankit Bose. The researchgate profile is as easily faked as a fake linkedin, facebook, pinterest.... Pubmed cannot be faked. Quintessential shows NO EVIDENCE linking the fake Ankit Bose profile to Penumbra. The simpletons at Quintessential cant see the obvious or are manipulating the obvious: some dork with no life created a fake internet profile to get friends or girls online. They chose a first initial and last name same as Arani Bose so they could use A Bose references as their own.It is true that neuroradiologists are concerned about the catheter in question and Penumbra has been losing market share to competitors. Full disclosure: I've never owned PEN until today. When I saw it drop for no good reason I bought at 185 and sold at 200. If idiots still believe the short seller and the price drops again I'll buy again. I am a medical doctor."

Your short seller garbage added a distortion to what's best for patients decision making.3:out right lies the whole antik bose nonsense you and those liars at quintessential capital was utter fabrication.

The company would not do this voluntarily.2 - PEN rejected all of the comments by the short sellers. It wasn't until the FDA forced them to recall the product that they responded properly. BTW - if the data was so misleading, why did the FDA support the recall?3 - The CEO admitted to faking the research supporting the products (which he supplied himself - not an unbiased third party) and admitted to using a fake persona.

"Anybody can build a short seller argument - i.e., no medical instrument is perfect and mis-application of medical instruments is always a possibility. Making up fake photos and fabrication statistics can be done by anyone these days. This is a typical short seller argument to drive the stock price down over a day or two. you'll probably never hear from the short seller again regarding this stock once he covers his short position. Just my opinion. Might be worth taking a long position right now to take advantage of the short term rampage on the stock. Buy a good company that is hammered by short term bad news. I've done very well doing that very thing for some time now. Give another day or three to get the stock to equalize and wring out the remaining weak hands; take a position, dollar cost average down, set an aggressive stop loss; and then wait. if it does not recover in a reasonable amount of time (few months) - check out , go find something else. There now you all know what to do. You're welcome."

"Resources Investment funds and groups entering the U market!First. Remember, the total uranium sector market cap today is only +-17 billion USD. That's a very tiny sector!!To put this into in perspectif.The entire market cap of uranium sector (17 billion$) =- 2% of the market cap of Tesla (810 billion$)- 40% of the market cap of Barrick Gold (42 billion$)- 34% of the market cap of Newmont (50 billion$)- 8% of the market cap of Exxon Mobil (205 billion$)- 9,5% of the market cap of Chevron (180 billion$)- 14,5% of the market cap of Boeing (117 billion$)In 2011 (not 2007) the total uranium sector market cap was 150 billion USD in USD of 2011.In 2007 the total uranium sector market cap was much higher then the 150 billion USD in 2011!!!Add to this the inflation between 2007 and today, and you have a easy multi-bagger sector here!Second. It's a mathematic fact that the global uranium supply and demand needs a sustainable 60+$/lb U3O8 to get back in equilibrium in the long term.At 30$/lb U3O8 only 40% of global annual U3O8 demand can be met by uranium miners!!==> This is not an IF question, this is a WHEN question!Third. There are multi signals that the uranium sector fundamentals are getting the attention from professional resources investors now.Some signals:""Soon we'll be sending private letters to many natural resource investment funds and groups, globally. Our letters, to new groups who might not be aware of the uranium supply debacle, will outline the broken status of the uranium business and the key points for them to perform their own work to see if we reach similair or differing conclusions. We'll offer each group networking opportunities and ways that we believe they can most effectively participate in recapitalizing a broken mining sector and supply chain"" Andrew Weekly, CEO SmithWeekly ResearchLarry McDonald on uranium:""I am also looking for financial players to get more serious about throwing weight around in this sector. A group with decent capital at a multi-strat HF or a medium sized fund could allocate a few hunderd mill and create their own reality in this sector, IMO. The order of operations would be to buy up positions in call option like U miners, then buy the U trusts trading at discounts and then hit the spot market hard. I think you would make money on all legs of that if you committed a few hunderd mill to it""==> An other investor spending a lot of time in macro and micro due dilligence work on this sector like me, ""intercepted"" a strategic chats a few weeks ago between professional traders of different financial institutions talking about preparing themself to come in action in the uranium sector. And like Larry McDonald saying to first buy the uranium company stocks and related financial instruments, second buying the U trusts (Uranium Participation, Yellow Cake) and then buying Uranium in the spotmarket (Professional investors with 3000000 million USD (100000lb x 30$/lb) on hand can buy physical uranium --> the minimum buying is 100000lb U3O8!)In the meantime the uranium etf's need to buy more underlying uranium company stocks and issue additional etf shares to keep up with the demand from investors ==> That's a big upward pressure on all those underlying uranium companies in which those etf's invest today and in the coming months (and couple of years).For instance:- ""Investors were piling into 100% Pure-Play ""North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF"" $URNM on NYSE yesterday, adding another 175,000 ETF shares - Now at 1,325,000 & AUM US$60.3M, over 20X higher than its US$3M inception just over a year ago""- ""Global X Uranium/Nuclear ETF $URA on NYSE added another 300,000 shares yesterday to bring their issued to 17.1M with US$276M in Net Assets - A 160% increase from its March low""Conclusion: A lot of money is coming into a very tiny sector to invest into. Multi-bagger moves higer coming.Be prepared and be patient.Don't try to swing trade uranium stocks. If you do, you will miss the biggest part of the bull trend$PEN.AX $PDN.AX $BMN.AXDenison mines, Nexgen, Fission Uranium Corp, Forsys Metals, UEX Corp, ...Energy Fuels, UR-energy, Cameco, Paladin Energy, Deep Yellow,...Cheers"

That is the toughest question on an otherwise collegial call. The entire thing is worth a listen if you have a position here, it is under events on the investors tab at company website. Analyst downgrades are sure to come based on uncertainty of future products (few answers were given because CEO said giving info would be a competitive disadvantage). There will also be concern about litigation, and lack of confidence on the part of both medical providers and shareholders. Meanwhile, short sellers claim to have yet more information to discuss tomorrow at 11am."
