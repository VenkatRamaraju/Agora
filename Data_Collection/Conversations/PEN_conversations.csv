Quintessential Capital Management@QCMFundsPenumbra's vascular division: Lightning already malfunctioned 86 times in handful of months. One source estimates a failure rate at about 10%. How long until injuries show up? Quality control anyone? We are looking into research and associated payments $pen @AlderLaneeggs
Wayne Heili@HeiliWayne·11hMy friends and quality advisors here on Twitter have inspired me into action. Pleased to intro the $PEN $PENMF new official profile @PEN_Energy Follow Peninsula Energy for the latest on our #uranium production ambitions.
"Tomorrow should be an interesting day, we have Penumbra CEO meeting with Bank of America for discussion. Then later Marc Cohodes is doing another Periscope. Interested if Penumbra or BoA bring up the jet 7 during the meeting and what they may say about it."

"Quintessential is trying to convince you that all the peer-reviewed papers with ""A Bose"" listed as an author is a fake internet profile Ankit Bose and not Arani Bose the real Chief Innovator/Co-Founder of Penumbra. If you search on pubmed (pubmed.gov, the gold standard in biomedical search engine) Arani Bose you will see legitimate articles listing A Bose as an author. If you search Ankit Bose you get nothing. There are zero articles published by the fake persona. Quintessential is so ignorant and/or unethical that they are using Researchgate (a commercial social networking site no legitimate scientist in the world uses) to investigate. Anyone can create a profile on researchgate which is exactly what the fake Ankit Bose did. Quintessential is the only person in the world being duped by this fake Ankit Bose. The researchgate profile is as easily faked as a fake linkedin, facebook, pinterest.... Pubmed cannot be faked. Quintessential shows NO EVIDENCE linking the fake Ankit Bose profile to Penumbra. The simpletons at Quintessential cant see the obvious or are manipulating the obvious: some dork with no life created a fake internet profile to get friends or girls online. They chose a first initial and last name same as Arani Bose so they could use A Bose references as their own.It is true that neuroradiologists are concerned about the catheter in question and Penumbra has been losing market share to competitors. Full disclosure: I've never owned PEN until today. When I saw it drop for no good reason I bought at 185 and sold at 200. If idiots still believe the short seller and the price drops again I'll buy again. I am a medical doctor."
"awfully quiet here... looks like it's all funds holding. QCM's short report is a must read, this company should be under investigation any day now."
Beat earnings and dropped 15%? Is this a good entry point?
Hi I bought 100 share price $95 but I sold 1 call strike price $90 price 11.20 now what can I do now I can’t sell share I stuck with call please I’m advise me
"Looking at top institutional holders, and looking at volume, doesnt appear they have even BEGUN to sell off, unless its OTC or in option form, the volume is not good, if I were institutional holder the open market wouldnt be an option to me, really what's the hedge? Try selling 500k"
"Hi NavAs I said----“Penumbra confirms the papers rumored to be attributed to Antik Bose are in fact attributed to Dr. Arani Bose. To imply that Dr. Arani Bose's peer-reviewed research, co-authored with a large cohort of his peers, was ever or would ever be attributed to anyone other than Dr. Arani Bose is inaccurate and conspiratorial.”"
"Resources Investment funds and groups entering the U market!First. Remember, the total uranium sector market cap today is only +-17 billion USD. That's a very tiny sector!!To put this into in perspectif.The entire market cap of uranium sector (17 billion$) =- 2% of the market cap of Tesla (810 billion$)- 40% of the market cap of Barrick Gold (42 billion$)- 34% of the market cap of Newmont (50 billion$)- 8% of the market cap of Exxon Mobil (205 billion$)- 9,5% of the market cap of Chevron (180 billion$)- 14,5% of the market cap of Boeing (117 billion$)In 2011 (not 2007) the total uranium sector market cap was 150 billion USD in USD of 2011.In 2007 the total uranium sector market cap was much higher then the 150 billion USD in 2011!!!Add to this the inflation between 2007 and today, and you have a easy multi-bagger sector here!Second. It's a mathematic fact that the global uranium supply and demand needs a sustainable 60+$/lb U3O8 to get back in equilibrium in the long term.At 30$/lb U3O8 only 40% of global annual U3O8 demand can be met by uranium miners!!==> This is not an IF question, this is a WHEN question!Third. There are multi signals that the uranium sector fundamentals are getting the attention from professional resources investors now.Some signals:""Soon we'll be sending private letters to many natural resource investment funds and groups, globally. Our letters, to new groups who might not be aware of the uranium supply debacle, will outline the broken status of the uranium business and the key points for them to perform their own work to see if we reach similair or differing conclusions. We'll offer each group networking opportunities and ways that we believe they can most effectively participate in recapitalizing a broken mining sector and supply chain"" Andrew Weekly, CEO SmithWeekly ResearchLarry McDonald on uranium:""I am also looking for financial players to get more serious about throwing weight around in this sector. A group with decent capital at a multi-strat HF or a medium sized fund could allocate a few hunderd mill and create their own reality in this sector, IMO. The order of operations would be to buy up positions in call option like U miners, then buy the U trusts trading at discounts and then hit the spot market hard. I think you would make money on all legs of that if you committed a few hunderd mill to it""==> An other investor spending a lot of time in macro and micro due dilligence work on this sector like me, ""intercepted"" a strategic chats a few weeks ago between professional traders of different financial institutions talking about preparing themself to come in action in the uranium sector. And like Larry McDonald saying to first buy the uranium company stocks and related financial instruments, second buying the U trusts (Uranium Participation, Yellow Cake) and then buying Uranium in the spotmarket (Professional investors with 3000000 million USD (100000lb x 30$/lb) on hand can buy physical uranium --> the minimum buying is 100000lb U3O8!)In the meantime the uranium etf's need to buy more underlying uranium company stocks and issue additional etf shares to keep up with the demand from investors ==> That's a big upward pressure on all those underlying uranium companies in which those etf's invest today and in the coming months (and couple of years).For instance:- ""Investors were piling into 100% Pure-Play ""North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF"" $URNM on NYSE yesterday, adding another 175,000 ETF shares - Now at 1,325,000 & AUM US$60.3M, over 20X higher than its US$3M inception just over a year ago""- ""Global X Uranium/Nuclear ETF $URA on NYSE added another 300,000 shares yesterday to bring their issued to 17.1M with US$276M in Net Assets - A 160% increase from its March low""Conclusion: A lot of money is coming into a very tiny sector to invest into. Multi-bagger moves higer coming.Be prepared and be patient.Don't try to swing trade uranium stocks. If you do, you will miss the biggest part of the bull trend$PEN.AX $PDN.AX $BMN.AXDenison mines, Nexgen, Fission Uranium Corp, Forsys Metals, UEX Corp, ...Energy Fuels, UR-energy, Cameco, Paladin Energy, Deep Yellow,...Cheers"
"Anybody can build a short seller argument - i.e., no medical instrument is perfect and mis-application of medical instruments is always a possibility. Making up fake photos and fabrication statistics can be done by anyone these days. This is a typical short seller argument to drive the stock price down over a day or two. you'll probably never hear from the short seller again regarding this stock once he covers his short position. Just my opinion. Might be worth taking a long position right now to take advantage of the short term rampage on the stock. Buy a good company that is hammered by short term bad news. I've done very well doing that very thing for some time now. Give another day or three to get the stock to equalize and wring out the remaining weak hands; take a position, dollar cost average down, set an aggressive stop loss; and then wait. if it does not recover in a reasonable amount of time (few months) - check out , go find something else. There now you all know what to do. You're welcome."
Any opinions about who is correct?
How does a company growing at 2 to 3% a year that just had it's flagship product recalled and which will soon be hit with dozens of wrongful death suits (their product liability insurance is probably void due to fraud) and which will have a lot of trouble getting anything through FDA in the future (because of the fraud) rate a PE near infinity?
Shares of Penumbra slid about 17% on Tuesday after short-seller Quintessential Capital Management released a critical report on the California-based medical devices maker. The stock was halted shortly after 2 p.m. ET for news pending.
"I actually read the report and I have NO position but wish I did now... I've never seen a situation where there can be no 'grey'. The shortseller makes some serious claims and backs it up with proof but if it were untrue then the company could EASILY disprove it by simply showing the real person that the report targets, is actually alive and not a fictitious profile.When this reopens for trading I""m going to look at buying Calls and Puts because it's a binary situation... this stock either goes down 50% or up by 50%."
"Jet 7 catheter has been recalled, congrats all the people who shorted. Longs got what they had coming."
"$URNM $UUUU $URG $PEN.AXThe only 3 companies (imo) that can deliver U3O8 to the US uranium reserve in 2021 that is mined in the USA are:- Energy Fuels- UR-energy- Peninsula EnergyBased on a source: ""The requests for proposal are send to the different US based miners in February 2021""Cheers"
"Hi NavTo answer your comments:1 - You may be right about the level benefits but that doesn't mean that level of failure is acceptable. No one wants them to discontinue the product - just fix it. The company would not do this voluntarily.2 - PEN rejected all of the comments by the short sellers. It wasn't until the FDA forced them to recall the product that they responded properly. BTW - if the data was so misleading, why did the FDA support the recall?3 - The CEO admitted to faking the research supporting the products (which he supplied himself - not an unbiased third party) and admitted to using a fake persona. So none of this material was in error."
"Arani Bose was the co-founder and primary developer of the Penumbra system. Prior to founding Penumbra with Adam Elsesser they founded Smart Therapeutics which was sold to Boston Scientific. Arani was a well known vascular interventionist who's work has saved thousands of lives, these short sellers are the ones that should be investigated and sued by Penumbra shareholders. Can't say how I know all of this other than to say I've known the parties involved on the company side for the better part of 20 years and they've been nothing but honest, ethical and incredibly focused and hard working. I remain 100% confident in the current Penumbra team."
