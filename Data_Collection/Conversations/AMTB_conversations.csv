Looks like IPO price made few people super rich and few people supper #$%$. If the market is expecting this to reach $60 then I am willing to take chances with my 20 shares. Hopefully this will start to rebound. It may also go down a bit more but I think at this point all the longs are holding and shorts have gotten out. Trading is flat throughout the day. May see some green soon.
