"average analyst price guide is $79 with a high of $100 - also, every quarter Ken says its going to collapse and has been proven wrong every single quarter for the past 2 years. 100% wrong, 8 times. 500 shares or BTC to whoever tracks the troll down."
"By the looks of todays sales trades, it is probably one of Evan Spiegels prescribed share sales days - what he needs another $200 mn payday for is beyond me though. Thoroughly oversold and will gap up today and tomorrow"
To give you a perspective $SNAP has almost identical revenue and EBIDTA with less money in the bank.It’s market cap is 20 times $WISH. Don’t let the CEO’s placid conference call phase you. He sold 100 million shares at 20$ per. I’m sure he plans to buy a hundred million back but might as well drop the share price a bit first. What does he care. Just means more money it the future. The company doesn’t need money or to please it’s investors.
$FB and $DATS making all time highs....LFG $SNAP!!!
"Credit Suisse analyst Stephen #$%$ increased his price target for the Snapchat parent company's stock from $90 to $110, and he reiterated an outperform rating."
"My goodness. You guys had another nice day (on top of a nice YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year runs). So strong.Can't help but to be grateful for shorts who have no families. Been rough existence for the kids.#wealthaccumulation"
BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!LOLOLOLOLLL!!!
I’m beyond impressed. Snap is incredible
"My goodness. If there are any shorts left, they sure have had a rough week and year. Heck, a tortured 3 years actually. There used to be this kid. Alias Boy they called him. Tried to short from $9 to $19. I think he took his medicine all the way up to $39 before bailing. Went by all kinds of names. Dan, d, Slick, Max, Big e, Investorwise, Ken, Real Dan, etc. Anyway, hopefully the kid found something he could succeed at. It wasn't pretty to watch.#snapwins"
SNAP is IBD's stock of the day!They are saying to buy at this point for a breakout.Does anybody have experience with IBD's stock of the day recommendations?How do those stock of the day perform after being recommended by IBD?
Wow. $5/7% intraday drop! VERY large volume. Straight down after the 1st 15 minutes (as ALWAYS). Hard to come up with a witty quip right now. Unless you're short of course.
SNAP would be about 125 if was in S&P 500 - time to get some voting rights to shareholders.
Hard to believe this was ever $80 - ever again either.
The big redness is good? Just more of the insiders sellings? Day before earnings?? WHY!!???
Just as I feared. The drop to $47 has officially beun. Just like last time they stunk up their earnings report. Atrocious.
"When snap was trading inside of $5, I reminded folks to buy snap hold snap and accumulate more on the dips! I received a lot of flack for that!Here’s the next big turnaround, RESN! But it hold it and accumulate more while cheap! You can thank me later"
This day/week just keeps getting more depressing. Can't wait till 4PM. The ship certainly has sailed on this stock. Zero buying interest remaining. ZERO. But then comes Monday....expect steady deterioration to sub $50 - like last time. Remember? $74 to $47 - almost over night.
Looks like we're headed back to hi $40's just like after last earnings unwarranted rise. This stock has burned a lot of people this year - A LOT.#seeyouatfortysevenagain
Remember when Ken said this was headed to the teens?
ouch - another face smashing day for the incredibly hopeless shorts who Constantly lose money on this stock month after month. Thanks guys for the free money
"Just took a glance to admire snap's YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year charts. The steady climb has been very impressive. Sadly I guess, novice shorts were decimated along the way. Some nice pre market action again. Cresting.#scoreboard"
"the relentless beating down of shorts over the past week, month, quarter, ytd, 12 and 24 months isn't a shock to anyone who understands media markets, performance advertising, DAU growth, partnerships or digital marketing and financial markets - of course if you don't understand these important factors that probably explains why you've shorted this and consistently lost money. Shorts - be better at what you do, go short some China stocks - you'll probably do better than your buddies who have lost over $2.5bn in the last couple of years trying to outshine the longs"
NWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!LOLOLOLL!!
"The pattern of Shorts is always the same.They compared $SNAP, $ETSY, and $SQ to $FB, $AMZN and $PYPL and said they would no longer grow.Think about it. When you sell stocks, Hedge funds are buying."
"Good question but there were so many of the fake names the kid used. Dan, Real Dan, d, slick, max big e, ken, investorwise, Gacy, etc. etc. The kid started showing his lack of knowledge in 2018 and we all had lots of laughs at his expense before I simply had to mute them all. Kid didn't want to learn. Wonder what stock he is losing with today?#unteachablecretin"
"Well folks - the usual 9:45 AM peak, then straight down 7% like a ton of bricks. With no attempt even at a partial comeback. This is SNAP's MO forever now. Yet newbies get duped every single time. Shorts sure played this one beautifully (again). And there's nothing witty to be said about that."
"I know. You see kids like Alias Boy trying to short a winning stock for years and you wonder just how underdeveloped were his parents? Any offspring who falls for the banana in the tailpipe so often has to be genetic miss of sorts.At any rate, continued prosperity to you guys. A great YTD, 1-year and 2-year story.#snapwinning"
The 6 Best Up & Coming Stocks To Buy Right Now! For details https://youtu.be/UyYUmQW9WJU
Ha ha ha ha. $110B market cap but never made a profit and huge debt. Snap’s net loss narrowed 53% to $152 million in Q2. Total Debt (mrq) 2.57B. This bubble is big.
The news? Even worse than expected? Dropping like the dead flies. The normal for this now?
$ROKU had become my largest holding and I needed to trim a bit. I will also be selling off about 5-10% of my $SNAP. I have seen massive profits in both companies and both are great stocks to own. I held onto 650 shares of $ROKU and will not be trading those shares. My portfolio currently stands at about a 20% cash position and I will be deploying about 1/2 of that over the next three months. I will be adding to $BRKB and continue to establish a core in $DKNG amongst others. I will also put on some trades in $ROKU if the opportunity presents itself. GLTM
I told you guys this is going back under 73 eventually. A 73 dollar stock with a 10 dollar gap in the charts from 63-73 is going to fill. Just give it time.
I am still excited about the report negative or positive. I will keep adding. I feel good about it.
Another good day for you longs after a choppy week in the markets.Cream rises. The rest takes care of itself. #scoreboard
Hyper growth social media stock..
"BOught 10000 Shares at 51 in May-2021, Should I sell and Lock-in Profit right Now ? Any advice ?"
Do they have cash or going to do stock pledging or dilution to pay employees ?
43M volume and no ones selling. Millions of puts expire this week and shorts are bleeding premiums meanwhile we beat earnings by a long shot. Never bet against SNAP
Its will breakout any time soon 80$ and beyond
All kidding to one side - can't find why this is getting clobbered yet again. And on a record setting day for the markets no less. Something going on with this. Will report back shortly.
"looks like ""get me in on a 45 deg. angle"" a big hitter is out there and buying every day.probably a hedge fund? imo."
Snaps own digital coin for AR commerce?
Great stock right now. This stock will be at 100 in no time.
SNAP should mark the lowest price at closing time to wait the rebound power.I think this is $72.0Hope it could mark at the closing.
Dropping another dollar plus in the last 20 minutes of the day (on huge volume) tells you all you need to know about the rest of the week.#andstillplummeting
Poor short cover now and count your loss before be more loss 
"$84-86 Price range in the near term, eventually $95-100 in 6 months"
Super long on this… I don’t need to state my conviction why. Snapchat alone has taken over the phones of most 13-30 year olds. Constant communication. Extreme long with shares in mid 40’s I hope to get them cheaper one day bring my cost average down. Made bank off 7/23 calls today. Really love this man. Don’t underestimate this one. remember they turned down facebook
Fear of stimulus full of the market
What - 50% value growth YTD? 51%? You guys are crushing it.
After a week like this I always find it best to crack open a Miller Lite and try to forget it. Need a lot of Lite to wash away this week lol. Best of luck next week to all longs. Cheers!
uhhhh yall see the volume on next week's $75 strike??
"all snap shorts have are desperate pleas for a market correction that isn't going to come, as analyst after analyst keeps upgrading the stock due to the continuing series of good news coming out - actual investors keep making real bank, whilst the shorts on the chase to a zero credit score- are forced to close their positions and pay their debts. Couldn't happen to more deserving people"
The stock market has become one big ponzi scheme. One where MM's use algorithm machine trading to keep stocks range bound. Taking money from longs and shorts. Stocks no longer trade on value. Only momentum. The SEC is worthless.
Futures looking pretty rough. SNAP will probably be gapped down in the morning and drop even more at open.
"This $7 to $70 rocket is the results of hard work. India strategy, strategic partnerships, user growth, AR leadership, ethical business practices and innovation. Evan & Co. have been exceptional.#longswinning"
ATH coming here. Too much positive activity in the economy to ever see red again. Thinking a war in Q4 combined with widespread foreclosures should be the next bullish catalysts.
See you next week...
I.B.D. buy point lol. makes good reading. when reality changes like tik/byte getting banned what do you think will happen? you can add an immediate 20 pts on for starters.
................. will happen watch
Remember November of 2019 or March of 2020 when we were sitting on $4 to $6 range. These little ups and downs don't effect me much at the $70 level.
What happened to 15 Gap Peter? you replied. That it will come down. It may bounce between 72 and 77. As usually it used before another 10 dollar leg up before next earnings. not going back to 60 until market crashes or some bad news comes. it is going dances here for a while and slow inch up.
My goodness. What another strong day for Evan & Co - and of course you guys. A rough 3+ years for shorts. Just bad luck I'm sure.#scoreboard

I dont have a position in SNAP. If I had it would be a short position. This is not growing fast enough to be in 100billion. Not even close. Only thing stopping me to take a short position here is the brain malfunction of so many for so long that it does not make any sense. These things dont have the lifespan of coca cola company…
"Even $76 is set as the new ground, very very strong to fly now.Buy it now, friends.Big discount"
"Dora is obviously shorting this and is starting to worry about her position as the stock hasn't really dropped from its earnings lift, the Ave analyst still has a high 80's target attached to it and for the past 10 earnings results - the stock has closed at or above the high end of the analysists figures. Listen to Dora only if you want her not to keep bleeding, personally that's her problem not mine, shorts have lost $3bn trying to short this stock over the past 2 years - more fool them - take advantage of today's discount"
See you there 80 85$ enjoy..
Seems nothing can stop this from continuing its' fall off a cliff lol. Laughing not to cry my friend. Not to cry.
"Is so nice for us. The up. The $73. Mmmmmm. Yes. Mmmmmm.Not so nice for paid short troll Mr. E, Mr. Kin, Mr. EL. And Ms. Fern. Always with the wrong. It wears its dented helmet.

"Buy calls in the late day, sell calls early in the trading session. Rinse, repeat. So good."
The gap has closed. Bye Bye Shorts….
"tech bottoming, pretty please"
Why the big drop back today? The insiders scheduled profit taking again?
Lower highs and lower lows every single day . 14% drop in 3 days!! Sheez Louise - when will the carnage stop?!
"In at $10.00, 100 shares long and strong.Have a enjoyable weekend Shorties!"
Shorts certainly own this. It's not just Evan's non-stop dumping.
ALWAYS THE GIVE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"facebook may claim to have more users but they dont. they have stagnant users. Kids dont like facebook. Pin, ETSY advertizing money is coming to SNAP because that is what kids want. With china crackdown on the online everything, tik tok will get their turn in the juicer. SNAP will be the big winner. 1T market cap within 2 years"
Last 3 Positive ER Stock Price is same $$63. This is going to fly tomorrow. It will cross $70 and even more. Mark my word.

There is a bull flag that has formed on the chart. It is holding above resistance. Big institutional investors are buying up the stock. We are going higher boys and girls.
.. 80$ again ....
"weak China figures, Afghanistan problems and a question of the fed taper coming to an end have brought some bargains up across the whole tech sector, I've just bought another chunk of SNAP as it's been so oversold this past week and especially today. Looking forward to the same levels of profit I got on my last buy in in the $50's - I was proven right then and I'm right again now"
"inflation jitters have affected all the growth stocks today, this one has been oversold on low volume - but I bet those institutional buyers who picked up stock in 800k, 500k, 400k etc tranches are going to be holding way past $100 expectations. Looks like we're in for some big upgrade news soon - I wonder when BofA will announce they're back in"
"According to reports, the US social media service Snap became the first top technology company to launch augmented reality glasses, entering this new generation of computing platform before Facebook and Apple."
BWAHAHAHA!!LOOLL!!

Looks like more pain with this today. Oh well at least we longs are used to it. Am I right lol? Laughing not to cry of course.

"Little Kenny learned a new word. ""Meme"". It's like a kid with a new toy. He sprinkles it in every post about 3 or 4 times."

Getting crushed again as expected. No enthusiasm for this anywhere. Look for a steady decline into next earnings. Hi $40's by then. Like last time. Sigh
"oversold as most of the tech stock has been today on barely any volume, should pop on any decent numbers on Monday- looking forward to seeing it in the 80's very soon. Congrats longs - strong week behind us and a stronger one ahead"

What’s the Apple and snap news?
@Peter it has hit lower B band. It should bounce back now any day.It may go down until 58.50 around. Other wise start bouncing up to 65 or so. if it crosses 65 then it will be upward trend to 70 and above. May be max to 90. then fall back again to mid 75. I am looking at the charts and talking from charts point of view.
Leading in AR and Social media. Next leg up 115-125$

I took a deep dive into the earnings report. I believe that I've found the source of the share price collapse since earnings. SNAP only rented out 6 bassinets last quarter. The number was expected to be 10 lol. If you're not laughing you're crying my friend. Not laughing - you're crying.

Why the big drop to the close? Insiders scheduled dumping again?
3rd time. check my post market price prediction. 72.80
"SNAP was $50 a share to start the year and now stands at $75 a share. 50% increase. Bashers /Shorts like to post comments about an underperforming company with no future to support their position, but they never reference the share price climb. I only referenced the YTD rise, the increase is greater if you go further back. The share price is not an opinion, it's a fact."
"Thinking about the prosperity Evan & Co has brought to their workforce, users and of course their investors. A tremendous success for all. I guess the fine print of this amazing story is the thinning of the herd that has occurred along the way with snap shorts. Steady devastation for what, three years now? #trailoftears"

Very soon watch 80$.....
"and as the market turns, so does snaps share price, which is cast iron proof that this recent drop in price was market driven rather than SNAP specific. No indication of price downgrades anywhere in the future, in fact looks like we are moving back up to 80+, glad I managed to pick up some more in the dip"
It's the humongous volume to the downside that concerns me the most. People are queing up to dump this at whatever they can get. Really something to see actually. Ouch
Nice work longs. Held up green on one of the reddest days of the year
100$ By end of the year
"$SNAP market cap = 119B , Revenue =2.5 B and $WISH has also 2.5B MCDo you really think Wish SP gonna stay this low ?"
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!LOLOLOOLLOLL!!!
80$ comming
IBD buy price @77 is resistance not a breakout point IMO
advertising will be the first thing on the chopping block as companies look to cut costs in an inflationary market...snap derives 100 percent of its' revs from advertising.This is a $120 billion fad company on a website where people exchange photos and videos.1.6 billion shares outstanding...this company will fail. Timetable to the start of its' demise is likely 3-6 months...no rush to get short...yet.
"Ken as always doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. SNAPs attrition rate against IOS 14 was negligible, showing exactly how engaged SNAPs users are with not only the product but also sharing data with it. No wonder FB has trust issues - Zuckerberg is a toxic entity and has about as much trust as Ken does amongst any credible audience. SNAP will continue upwards as the audience is happier interacting with it rather than FB/IG's users"
Here we go..
"lil'lyin'loserkenny is polluting the board with his desperate posts yet again. SNAP's producing massive growth, an incredibly loyal and interactive audience, huge amounts of content, new and improved partnerships and great new ad revenue streams, that's why it keeps on getting upgrade after upgrade and large price hikes. Well done to those investors who are capitalising on this innovative growth tech firm. shorts - you were told, keep handing your money to your betters"
will be better than $SNAPhttps://www.datchat.com/
"snap may close positive today . if it does and the markets are done selling here for now , it will lead any and all 'social media plays' and head to 105 by mid Oct."

"One app, advertising making up majority of revenue, and limited time on public market: hard to picture this stock in five years. It could be the next Facebook growth story, it definitely caters to the more growing younger generations than older folk ($FB). I do not doubt the staff, rejecting the Facebook buyout must have taken guts: I'd carefully weigh your risks before investing."
Please tell me that you didn't buy near $80 this morning? Oh my. An apparently endless stream of dummies out there. The near daily 6-7% intraday drop - like clockwork. If you are a short you don't even need a GED to get rich here. Guaranteed to drop every time. Sweet lord above.
Is snap coming out with its own digital coins to support AR commerce?
AH seems to be running in SNAP's favour - investors looking at the low bounce rate that SNAP has vs IOS 14 indicates that SNAP has become the overall trusted social site vs FB/IG. I imagine that PINS will also do well against this metric
"Tech down but snap gets a little green kick again and cresting $75. Good stuff. Always nice when folks who put in the work get rewarded. Congrats to you, longs. Well done.#rewardsforthelearned"

Looks like more pain for longs today. Poor saps can't catch a break lol.
I bought into SNAP for my daughter. I bought in at $41 and will keep waiting. I saw something a while ago (could of been a conspiracy and something not take seriously) .. basically it was kind of showing that SNAP is part of an elite cabal and they have been chosen to succeed in the NWO.
"SNAP is one of the great purchases I made, I'm glad I added more before the spike. Yes I averaged up but who the heck cares, I made more money! Do the math! The other superstar I bought at $68 is Moderna baby! Let's rock and roll!!!"
It's a fair question but I don't know why a kid would post about three years of losses attempting to short a wildly successful stock. My sense is that looking at the parents would tell the story.#geneticflaws
SNAP is going to dominate the social media market and soon the artificial reality scene. Look for $85 after 3rd quarted and to top $100 after year end.

Been doing it since the stock was $8, will be doing it when the stocks $150 - what a zero cred joker.

Yes few stock can drop 2-3% as quickly and reliably as this does. Easy $$ for shorts. Too easy.
"5 day chart shows a huge gap from 63-74. $11 gap, it will probably get filled this week, down to mid 60s then the week or 2 after make the bounce back up into the 80s. Good short play, and good long term play, buy those gaps up."
A little deep digging: apparently SNAP will fall short on bassinet rentals. They will rent out 3 this quarter. Whisper # was 5. Hence the 6% huge volume drop today.
"Great price action today & good future for SNAP stock. But to think that after a roughly 25% one-day increase will continue to rally, you're letting greed override common sense and experience. Gap-ups like that are retested all the time. Next week will pull back some, probably into the upper 60's for a small amount of time before it gets its next legs. For long-term investors, who cares, you're in it for the long haul. But for traders, not taking profits on a 25% day (or more if you got in before today) is sloppy, greedy trading and the Bears will eat your lunch in the short-term."
Nice board with real Peter banned. Mute Greg and very enjoyable experience now.
Feel good to get real Peter fired from board. His contributions were zero here Just mean spirit.
It's a good question and one we don't have the answer to. How many shorts have been destroyed along the trail of $7 to $70? Thousands? Countless. So difficult to say.#trailoftears
Congrats on a positive week SNAP longs
$snap HUGE beat in earnings!-Revenue up 116% to $982M-Net loss up 53% to $(152)M YoY-Adjusted EBITDA up 223% to $117M YoY
BWAHAHA!!!LOLOLLLOLLOLLL!!!
Leading in AR and Social Media. Snaps taking over. Next leg up 110-125$
"Good point. There may not be a slower ""investor"" than snap shorts. Genetics can be tragic.Remember that kid Alias Boy? Used to post here every day for years. Excuse after excuse after excuse...#trailoftears"
..........we are there just hold your shares
Looks like the floor held. Up we go.
"I’m sure $SNAP bag holders weren’t too happy when it gapped down 17% to 5.70 a share in 2018 after ER. Has the story changed for $WISH? If the story hasn’t changed fundamentally, there is no reason to sell."
Nice day for tech. Well.....you know....#mosttechanyway
"Another nice day yesterday and today cresting nicely.You guys have had a tremendous 3+ year run. Sadly for Team Cretin & the Shorts, they have been destroyed.#scoreboard"
"Just glancing that even with the markets pulling back you guys are still cresting $73. Very nice run. YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year charts a thing of beauty.#scoreboard"
My goodness. Just took a peek at the snap charts. Up 54% ytd? 1-year and 2-year charts a thing of beauty too. A shame Alias Boy and Team Cretin had to be trampled along the way. The kid never wanted to learn.#teachablemoments
$zm $docu $snap $NFLX all proved re-opening is not negatively affecting their growth. $Nvda proved gaming industry is soaring. Why T F is everyone so afraid of this company not exceeding expectations?? Forward p/e under 15. This is a joke and an outright buy!
Another crash into the close. Near the LOD. As markets all finished strong. And on high volume as well.#notwhatyouwanttosee
Got a feeling that $90.00 by end of the year is possible.
"The new Wall Street hustle. Identify meme and meme-like stocks that have a low budget retail investor base and cult following. Pin the stock so it's range bound. Pump the stock and collect option premiums. Finally, when this no longer works and the stock falls out of favor with its irrationally exuberant retail investor base. Allow, the stock to tank via its own record of financial disappointment and short it on the way down. Happened with GRPN, GPRO, DDD, FIT, and countless other cult stocks. Where the majority of the hype was coming from retail investors hoping to hit big off a minimal purchase of shares. Those holders (most holding 100 or fewer shares...) like SNAP share holders saw the highs. Then, watched their gains diminish. With the majority thinking the stock would make a comeback like they had been lulled into believing. Effectively being hustled by the same crooks that have known what they were doing since the beginning. This is why none of the so called longs here will debate SNAP's market cap and lack of profitability."
Another great day for SNAP.
Crashing pre-market. Looks like another bad one today.#dontbeafool
"open wide...Mike, smallPeter/Pete, Fern, etc"
as the analysts have stated - average price expecation runs cool at $85 and more realistically towards $115. Added benefit is seeing those silly marketdumb shorts getting torched
"It's a good question. I've always been an advocate of high school level investing courses to provide kids the fundamentals. Without some guidance, you see some of the lesser thinking kids make poor decisions like shorting snap for 3 years straight and draining their parents accounts. Fresh stimulus checks - poof.#edcuateouryouth"
Just pondering the financial ruin of snap shorts who rode the $7 to $70 train of destruction. Three disastrously unfortunate years for the kids who sadly never wanted to learn.#trailoftears
Congrats on another great day SNAP longs. You guys sure know how to pick the undervalued stocks
"another shortcrushing day, well done longs, anyone who has been listening to the short troll with all the aliases - sorry for your losses but thanks for your cash, it'll go alongside the other $2.5bn that shorts have bled over the last 2 years"
Remember $snap movement a couple years ago. Holding tight and sleeping like a baby at night
Sounds like SNAP is eating FB’s lunch after Facebook earnings. To 100 by end of year!!! Let’s go!!!
Buying
"anyone heard from Kens 3rd most incorrect alias EL? he usually says the stock is going to single figures about now, then Ken rolls out bigDumbE to back up why he bought FB in 1956 and has never sold a share in his lifetime and never will. So much fun"
More of the insiders scheduled crushing of share price? WHY???!!! STOP!!!!
Very strange price for a company that has never earned a net profit.
You heard . Round 2 will be stronger 
The grill is fired up so how would you longs want your short steaks? Well done!
How is this staying above $70? Amazing!
It May touch $65 today around high $64. If Volume increase then it will go above $65.
$SNAP 2018... 1200% upside...
I have to agree. This steady stream of red days is getting tiresome indeed.#gettingcrushedyetagain
Pummeled from $7 to $70 has left only the slowest short still standing. Genetics aren't always kind to the human race. Or to a fresh water eel.#shortpaindaily
Where's $80??!! Where's the $70's??!!! WHAT HAPPENED HERE???!!!
"Snap never made actual profit, not enough to pay staffs, they issue stock award to pay themselves.I bought 20 put options earlier, did great today. Couples of $KBe careful falling in love, or investing in hypes of fast growing tech, I think this is almost mature business, and it can slow growth by the time pandemic is over. The big Wall street players know it, and they are pumping in AM and dumping at PM, they don't want hold them over night.No hard feeling.Just my different opinion, and we are all here to make some money out of Wall street casino."
New LOD. Just as you'd expect with the news out. A couple of bucks drop every single day as has been happening for days now and we'll see that $47 very quickly.#nobottominsight
They had some interesting insights about SNAP on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!LOLOLOLL!!!
What happened to $79? $78? $77? $76? $75? WHAT HAPPENED??
Why the late collapse? More Evan dumping? STOP!!!!!!
I bought this way back at 17.75 mainly due to an acquisition they made in AI. I'm holding forever.
why the brutal action today sirs? earnings were off the charts. right? weren't they? ty sirs#spotonindeed
Yep - 3-4% drop in share price each day adds up very quickly. Please tell me that you didn't buy this morning near $73? Please.
"Yep. $7 to $70 train is no lie. Longs accumulate wealth. Shorts accumulate stimulus. ""It's a lifestyle""#scoreboard"
"Just so happy for you longs. An outstanding 3-year run for you guys with an even better forecast.Well done again, longs. Well done.#shortsareamusing"
Social network stocks always not affected by the stimulus factors.No fear here.
You heard we back ......
"Always fun to be on the right side of the deal, even better if there are shorts being crushed at the same time"
It's the massive volume of these daily implosions that most concerns me. Sheez Louise
"Overall revenue skyrocketed by a very impressive 116% from $454 million a year earlier to $982 million, which is its strongest growth rate yet. That's faster than even that of Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB)."
this is so overvalued imo. the revenue is no where near its market cap
Congrats to all buyer under 70$

It's the huge volume that most concerns me. a collapse is a collapse. But a big volume collapse signals real danger ahead.#dangercoming
Welcome to Seinfeld’s Bizzaro World. Only is this market can $CLF make more money in quarterly profit that $SNAP brings in quarterly revenue. $CLF 800 million in profit and 1.33 per share vs a $SNAP 1 cent loss. $SNAP up 20 percent $CLF down 1 percent. Showing profit is so 1999!!
"Well technically snap has more than double the amount of active users than Twitter and is now nearly even with Instagram, it’s only after q1 earnings we learned snap had passed 500million DAU, well assuming average revenue per user remains constant we should have a nice beat…."
BWAHA!!LOLL!
"How to spot a snake oil salesman (i.e., GRACE) 101. They try to compare every non profitable company they're peddling (e.g., SNAP) to AMZN. As if every company winds up being arguably the greatest company EVER."
I know. And I get it. I've received no joy watching shorts get scorched from $7 to $70. Most shorts want to learn and do better in life. Learn. Live. And then there are kids like Alias Boy. Kids that never wanted to do the work.#lostyouths
Guys let’s keep selling
Looks like your Friday momentum will continue. Cresting $73 nicely.
target price is anywhere between $85 and $115 - congrats longs on the latest upgrades- looks like we are going to smashing the shorts lives for another 12 months at least
"Remember who told you to buy snap hold snap and accumulate more on the dips? Well here’s another one to buy, Resonant! Buy it hold it and accumulate it while it’s still cheap! You can thank me later"
"Just glancing at your YTD, 1-year and 2-year charts. Exceptional performance. Fueled a bit by short fails I guess.Always enjoy facts on a stock's performance. Congratulations, longs.#scoreboard"
"Goodness. The $7 to $70 train aside, even the YTD is so pleasant to the eye. 49% ? Well done, snap longs. Well done."
can't believe people still buy this every morning. #getabrokerdummies
Keep it coming. Been in since $12
"Ethical business practices, user growth, A/R leadership, India strategy and executive team excellence. The rest takes care of itself as we see.Cresting pre-market nicely.#snapwins"
Most undervalued stock on the NYSE
12% drop in a couple of weeks. Steady and consistent in one direction. Straight down. Shorts played this one beautifully - as always.
Remember who’s been telling you to buy snap hold snap and accumulate more on the dips for the past 3 years? Now you know why
"so we should see a $10-$15 uplift over the next week or two, congrats smart investors"
I know. A human tragedy how that Alias Boy tried shorting snap from $7 to $70. Can't make up that kind of dull wittedness.#scoreboard
I get it. Shorts like Alias Boy have been riding the financial ruin train from $7 to $70. This while longs and basic investors have been accumulating tremendous wealth. The kids didn't want to put in the work. Simple as that.#scoreboard
<5m volume - has averaged less than 23% of the hourly volume since 10.30am - a flat day that will allow a quick bounce back tomorrow and next week- as I said last week - we'll be revisiting $80 soon
Try INTC 20 billion revenue per quarter and 3.5 billion profit . Stock down 5% and worth only 2x with 30x the revenue of snap. Bizzare is understatement. INTC employs 100k employees and most high tech semi factories. Vs snap which is what glorified text messaging from basement ?
... watch and learn this week...
Still highly undervalued. Leading company in AR and Social media. Very bright future for this company
as long as the broader market stays green I believe we'll top yesterday's high
Impressive! $SNAP EARNINGS vs. estimates:- EPS Beats $0.10 Adj. vs. ($0.01) Est.- Revs. Beat $982M vs. $846M Est.- DAU: 293M vs. 290M est.
"not sure what I am missing here ""shorts""...it launched from the 50s into the 70s and it has been holding essentially a 50% upswing so yeah keep whining lolwake up, Apes, you are going to get smoked again if you think this is going to fold in half going into a historically strong September quarter with user/ad numbers firing on all cylinders"
I like snapchat but at a 115B market I can't justify buying... I'd actually consider shorting. what do you guys think?
Imagine the powerful earnings report will keep all but the slowest of shorts quiet for a few weeks.Cresting $73 nicely pre market.#evanwinsagain
