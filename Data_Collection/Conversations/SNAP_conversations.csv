"weak China figures, Afghanistan problems and a question of the fed taper coming to an end have brought some bargains up across the whole tech sector, I've just bought another chunk of SNAP as it's been so oversold this past week and especially today. Looking forward to the same levels of profit I got on my last buy in in the $50's - I was proven right then and I'm right again now"
this is a future $SNAP.. get in before it goes big!
Yep - looks like I was correct as always. Getting crushed right out of the gate - again.
Looks like more pain for longs today. Poor saps can't catch a break lol.
100$ By end of the year
Always gives it back! ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tom Lee says melt up in the Market September. Shorts are dead.
Its will breakout any time soon 80$ and beyond
"open wide...Mike, smallPeter/Pete, Fern, etc"
Congrats on another great day SNAP longs. You guys sure know how to pick the undervalued stocks
"I’m sure $SNAP bag holders weren’t too happy when it gapped down 17% to 5.70 a share in 2018 after ER. Has the story changed for $WISH? If the story hasn’t changed fundamentally, there is no reason to sell."
I like snapchat but at a 115B market I can't justify buying... I'd actually consider shorting. what do you guys think?
ouch - another face smashing day for the incredibly hopeless shorts who Constantly lose money on this stock month after month. Thanks guys for the free money

The stock market has become one big ponzi scheme. One where MM's use algorithm machine trading to keep stocks range bound. Taking money from longs and shorts. Stocks no longer trade on value. Only momentum. The SEC is worthless.
"Cresting nicely again pre market. It's been said snap charts are worth framing as beautiful pieces of artwork for longs. Sadly, worthy of tombstones for the unwilling to learn shorts.#scoreboard"
Another good day for you longs after a choppy week in the markets.Cream rises. The rest takes care of itself. #scoreboard
SNAP is IBD's stock of the day!They are saying to buy at this point for a breakout.Does anybody have experience with IBD's stock of the day recommendations?How do those stock of the day perform after being recommended by IBD?
"Just glancing at your YTD, 1-year and 2-year charts. Exceptional performance. Fueled a bit by short fails I guess.Always enjoy facts on a stock's performance. Congratulations, longs.#scoreboard"
My goodness. What another strong day for Evan & Co - and of course you guys. A rough 3+ years for shorts. Just bad luck I'm sure.#scoreboard
$FB and $DATS making all time highs....LFG $SNAP!!!
"Remember who told you to buy snap hold snap and accumulate more on the dips? Well here’s another one to buy, Resonant! Buy it hold it and accumulate it while it’s still cheap! You can thank me later"
target price is anywhere between $85 and $115 - congrats longs on the latest upgrades- looks like we are going to smashing the shorts lives for another 12 months at least
"snap may close positive today . if it does and the markets are done selling here for now , it will lead any and all 'social media plays' and head to 105 by mid Oct."
I.B.D. buy point lol. makes good reading. when reality changes like tik/byte getting banned what do you think will happen? you can add an immediate 20 pts on for starters.
"Just had a moment to check in on your performance. YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year charts so very lucrative for you guys. Undeniably strong performance. Congrats on hitching to this green wagon.#scoreboard"
Cybersecurity breakthrough within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Price ready to pop really big!

"My goodness. You guys had another nice day (on top of a nice YTD, 1-year, 2-year and 3-year runs). So strong.Can't help but to be grateful for shorts who have no families. Been rough existence for the kids.#wealthaccumulation"
Hard to believe this was ever $80 - ever again either.
They had some interesting insights about SNAP on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Good point. There may not be a slower ""investor"" than snap shorts. Genetics can be tragic.Remember that kid Alias Boy? Used to post here every day for years. Excuse after excuse after excuse...#trailoftears"
Remember $snap movement a couple years ago. Holding tight and sleeping like a baby at night
12% drop in a couple of weeks. Steady and consistent in one direction. Straight down. Shorts played this one beautifully - as always.
Never holds the gains! NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!LOLOLOLL!!!
Nice day for tech. Well.....you know....#mosttechanyway
"all snap shorts have are desperate pleas for a market correction that isn't going to come, as analyst after analyst keeps upgrading the stock due to the continuing series of good news coming out - actual investors keep making real bank, whilst the shorts on the chase to a zero credit score- are forced to close their positions and pay their debts. Couldn't happen to more deserving people"
I dont have a position in SNAP. If I had it would be a short position. This is not growing fast enough to be in 100billion. Not even close. Only thing stopping me to take a short position here is the brain malfunction of so many for so long that it does not make any sense. These things dont have the lifespan of coca cola company…
will be better than $SNAPhttps://www.datchat.com/
"Thinking about the prosperity Evan & Co has brought to their workforce, users and of course their investors. A tremendous success for all. I guess the fine print of this amazing story is the thinning of the herd that has occurred along the way with snap shorts. Steady devastation for what, three years now? #trailoftears"
