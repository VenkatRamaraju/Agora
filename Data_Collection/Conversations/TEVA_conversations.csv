"Based on current CF in 6 years, the company will be able to buy itself!"
It isn't every day you get the opportunity to buy into a great company at a price so close to the book value.
"You might remember when we were getting hammered by TEVA's decline, the trading pattern would be up in the am and then closing lower into the close. Today it is up in the am, then going lower, and then gaining strength in the pm going into the close. I believe the pattern will continue until we see a definitive result on the opioid lawsuits in Ca and NY. A day traders dream"
They are still forecasting $2.50+ eps or less than 4 PE. This is a $25+ stock today!
"Seems like the drop in share price started near the end of the Tel Aviv market, which I believe coincides with Novartis’ earnings report release which included the 20% drop in their US generics market which they state was impacted by COVID. So perhaps this is a temporary situation that should get back to normal soon."
"What a bad companymarket cap 10.4B ( only $ 9.10)sales 16B+earnings 2B+ (about $2+ EPS)free cash flow 2B+wait until yahoo updates quarterly statements, and 3 quarter 2020 impairment for litigation cases disappear, soon you will see instead of -3.97 EPS, a whooping $2+ EPS to see how this will skyrocket to to orbit (phase 1)After settlements happen, skyrocket to the moon nonstop (phase 2)yesterday and today many shorted the stock, but it can't go much lower for long time. We have an ultra coiled spring, ....waiting to be released.........tic, toc, tic, toc......"
Same story on 11 aug and 10 jun look like someone make profit with some algo trades and investor fears
"Let me repeat myself in another way. Can TEVA sell $4 billion of bonds if there is a major opioid overhang?Obviously they have something positive to say about that issue, which they will no doubt share with potential purchasers. In theory, those purchasers will then have ""inside information,"" and thus won't be able to buy stock. But that never quite keeps them from stepping out, or ""telling their friends.""So I bought another 20,000 in front of that.Just my opinion, but think about it. Who would buy debt if there is a potential for a negative outcome re: opioids?"
200k share buy tonight.........pray for me
Near a 52 week low. Opioid cases closer to settlement over 700 Mil in free cash flow over the last 3 months. New Drugs on the verge of getting approved. Market is a little off base.
I like those bots posts of 'TEVA looks like it is about to drop'it is a good sign.
"say all you want, bottom line is disappointing. lost 12% in 2 days over nothing. very weak."
Generic drug sales will be a disappointment due to pandemic. Hopefully we get some positive information regarding the litigation.
"October 28, Anda's Letter to NY Court Concerning Deposition Testimony of Former Employees Anda submits this letter to address the objections raised by the Plaintiffs to the admission into evidence of VIDEO deposition testimony of two former Anda employees, Michael Cochrane and Robert Brown. As explained below, both depositions of these key former Anda employees are plainly admissible under CPLR 3117; and the only questions are whether (1) the witnesses are greater than 100 miles from the court or out of state; and (2) whether their absence was procured by Anda. Here, both questions are easily answered in Anda’s favor. Both witnesses reside out of state in south Florida, a distance from this courthouse that far exceeds 100 miles. Further, the termination of Mr. Cochrane’s and Mr. Brown’s employment with Anda and their residence in Florida long pre-date the Counties’ suits against Anda. Clearly, Anda did not “procure” their absence from the Court’s jurisdiction, which typically requires evidence of threats, intimidation, improper inducements or chicanery to prevent the witness from appearing to testify.*Mr. Cochrane - Anda’s Executive Director of Regulatory Compliance until October 2016*Mr. Brown - Anda’s Director of Compliance until January 2017. Plaintiffs in the In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (“MDL”) Track 1 cases sought the depositions of Messrs. Cochrane and Brown in the fall of 2018.To avoid needless duplication, those depositions were imported into this action by operation of Case Management Order (September 5, 2018)Anda made clear as early as March 2020 that it intended to call these former employees to testify at trial by deposition. Mr. Cochrane and Mr. Brown were so listed on Anda’s initial trial witness list served on March 4, 2020, and in every subsequent witness list Anda has provided in this case.In their case-in-chief, the Counties indicated that they intended to introduce deposition testimony from both witnesses, and submitted the designated testimony to the Court for rulings on objections in August. Because the Counties decided not to present these witnesses’ testimony to the jury, the Court did not issue rulings. Anda submitted the same designated testimony to the Court for rulings on October 26th, which prompted Plaintiffs’ ill-founded objections."
I'm guessing $ENDP and $TEVA are both down because yesterday a bankruptcy judge declined to pause litigation in the JNJ talc cases in which it is attempting to move the assets to a separate company that is going to file Chapter 11 to force a settlement. This tactic is being watched closely by all involved in Opioid litigation as it offers more pressure for settlement if it works for JNJ.
Reaffirming all guidance for 2021…excellent
"The European business is worth 15 billion $ (Ratiopharm in Germany alone can be sold immedialtely for 5 billion). Austedo will make 2 billion in sales in 2 years with a profit of 1.8 billion. Austedo could be sold for 10 billion. The research pipeline is valued at zero. Teva is worth 11 billion on the stock market. So it‘s a worthwhile target for an activist shareholder if the share price doesn‘t move up soon (by the way: Buffet has not sold a single share). Whether there is a settlement or an activist shareholder, the stock will go to 30 $ in either scenario. So be patient."
I pray that we will not see single digits ever ever again
Analysts linked Teva's fall to disappointing generic sales from Novartis today.
I have a good feeling about a settlement announcement today or tomorrow
"A trip down memory lane with Erez Vidogman, August 4, 2016. Actavis purchase for 40.5 billion, market cap of Teva now under 10 billion:Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA will remain in the hunt for more acquisitions after completing a deal to buy Allergan's AGN.N generics business for $40.5 billion this week.Teva expects to generate free cash flow of more than $25 billion through 2019 from the integration of Actavis, $5 billion of which will go towards dividend payouts.“The rest will be divided between paying down debt and entertaining attractive specialty deals,” Erez Vidogman, Teva’s chief executive, told a conference call of analysts following the publication of second-quarter results."
"The simple truth is that without a catalyst (i.e settlement, continued debt paydown, top line growth) the market will not change its discount rate on the value of future cash flows. The present discount rate fall somewhere between 8-12% while other drug companies have around a 3-6%. When the risk gets factored out of this stock it will be re-priced."
in the next week 10$
"J&J announced a $297M opioid settlement with Texas and its subdivisions today. With this agreement, the Company is removed from the pending Texas state and subdivision litigation, including two bellwether trials scheduled for early 2022.The $297 million settlement with Texas is consistent with the terms of the previously announced nationwide opioid settlement agreement. The dollar amount to be received by the State is the pro-rated share it would have received under this agreement, which will be deducted from the all-in settlement amount. This settlement is not an admission of any liability or wrongdoing and the Company will continue to defend against any litigation that the final agreement does not resolve."
"Just bought in.. highly undervalued stock, profitable and defensive, people need meds. The merger a few years ago was a con but we have new mgmt and bod and opioid crisis is behind us. The debt is very manageable"
Tomorrow Teva reports earnings. The market is giving negative sentiment to the earnings reports tomorrow. Nothing to do with the trial. The market could be right or could be wrong. But 6% down is way too negative. Imao.
TEVA=Organized manipulation
Missed on earnings missed on revenue I guess this leaked out yesterday here we are at Teva bag holders again.
"TEVA is the pride of Israel and the World's largest Pharma supplying 3500 drugs yet its Market cap is only $11 B. SOLANA is a made up crypto currency, with no assets to back it up, yet it has a Market cap of $60 B.What a joke !"
"Teva Announces Launch of $4,000,000,000 Offering of Sustainability-linked Senior Notes"
"Have lots of TEVA- Yes, I am humble and readily admit it's another haircut. Painful - No doubt the shorts won the day. With that said, I'll hold thru the storm. Won't sell a single share. Iv'e learned it's usually never good to sell into any panic. So, I'll see what the next 12 months bring. Awful morning for people like me. GLTA D"
"10/11/2021 - Opposition Of Teva To Plaintiff’s Motion By Order To Show Cause in NY(excerpt)On October 1, the State of NY filed a meritless Motion by Order to Show Cause (“OTSC”) alleging that Defendants failed to comply with certain discovery obligations by allegedly (1) not disclosing discoverable documents relating to certain DEA” inspections, (2) not producing certain documents in the custody of their parent company, and (3) not disclosing information produced in ongoing litigation in the Court for the Northern District of California. With all due respect to the State, it should have more carefully and diligently reviewed the discovery record before lobbing the shrill and unfounded accusations it made in the OTSC. And, after having done so, it could have and should have addressed and resolved any remaining questions it had through a professional meet-and-confer process. But such collaboration never seems to be of interest to the State, which consistently seems to prefer casting dramatic aspersions to engaging in professional dialogue. In short, had the State met even the most basic requirements of conferring with counsel, this unnecessary imposition on the Court’s time and resources would have been avoided. Further, the State is not entitled to take another belated bite at the apple by trying to bring Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Israel) into this case. (by alleging that some doctors were paid by Teva, Ltd. ""Israel"")Once either the Court or Justice Maltese has the opportunity to cut through the State’s unnecessary hyperbole and assess the actual facts, these issues will lend themselves to prompt resolution. This case does not need another sideshow intended by the State to divert attention from the material facts at issue.Defendants fully satisfied their discovery obligations by producing the documents to which the parties agreed. If the State did not like its agreement and wanted to renegotiate the scope of discovery, it should have – and could have – endeavored to do so long before discovery closed in New York. The State cannot – at this late hour – now endeavor to alter the terms of its unambiguous prior agreement based on some notion of “buyer’s remorse.” That is especially true given that the State has been well-aware since long before this trial began that Defendants made sometimes voluminous productions in other opioid cases around the country. Accordingly, the State’s complaint about a lack of notice of discovery in other opioid cases rings false.This litigation continued under the parties’ Discovery Agreement for more than two years. Now, 15 months after the close of discovery and over four months into trial, the State claims that it is entitled not only to more than what it agreed to accept, but also to specific notice and disclosure of all documents produced in every one of the multitude of opioid cases throughout the United States. Defendants honored their discovery obligations and agreements in this case. The State needs to do so as well.In the end, the only record that the State points to that it claims should have been produced under the Discovery Agreement is a single 2005 email.The State’s allegation is frivolous and, if not an oversight based on a failure to search the discovery record, appears to have been deliberately manufactured in an attempt to create an issue where none exists.The State not only waived its right to discovery from other litigations when it made the Discovery Agreement with Defendants, but also waived any argument to the contrary long before filing its OTSC. The State did so by sitting on its hands for years fully aware, and taking full advantage, of the discovery about which it now feigns ignorance."
"A funny gift for our fellow traveler, Michael (aka ""why does Kåre not hold a daily press conference?"") : Suffolk County Legislator Arrested in Pills for Sex StingSuffolk County Legislator William “Doc” Spencer (D-Centerport) was arrested on October, 2020 for attempting to trade oxycodone for sex.Spencer, 53:- has been a legislator since 2012 and serves on the county’s opioid task force.-is married and has three children.-is an ordained minister, Spencer serves as the Pastor of Willow Manor Fellowship in Centerport.-was the chief of otolaryngology at Huntington Hospital. -is also Associate Clinical Professor at Stony Brook University Hospital. -runs a private practice, Long Island Otolaryngology & Pediatric Airway in Huntington.Spencer, was in a Suffolk County vehicle at the time of the arrest, allegedly planned to meet a prostitute in the parking lot of a Goodwill store in Elwood to trade sex for the pills, which were reportedly oxycodone, a legal form of an opioid. Authorities had arranged a sting operation.Spencer, who had two oxycodone pills in his possession at the sting operation, is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony.Prior to his arrest, Spencer had been involved in several legislative efforts, including to combat the effects of the opioid epidemic. Spencer proposed a resolution that passed unanimously to make Narcan, which reverses the effects of narcotics, available to policy emergency responders in the Second Precinct.Spencer had sponsored 35 resolutions, with close to 1/3 of them related to health and safety, including prohibiting smoking at county beaches and county parks. Spencer’s bills include a 5-cent fee for single use plastic bags, which stores started charging in January, 2018.During his time in office, Spencer had worked to ban the sale of powdered caffeine to minors, raise the age of selling tobacco products, helped pass a measure to stop companies from manufacturing energy drinks to youth and led a ban on flavored e-cigarettes."
started the debt restructuring. that means they have ~accurate estimation of the final settlement value?
Raymond James says to ignore this stock. So today will mark the bottom.
"Here's my prediction for tomorrow.Teva will hit the numbers, possibly even exceed the adjusted EPS number. And the conference call will mirror what the CFO said about the cost of the opioids. People who sold today will kick themselves so hard their feet will break; people who bought will be laughing.Hasta manana."
Talk about illegal information leak yesterday. How many people knew the earnings were weak when the stock was selling off yesterday. What B>S>
"Why don’t we do Reddit type trade of our own? Let us all buy Teva which is unfairly undervalued and manipulated 16.4 billion revenue, 2.3 billion fcf trading at just 8.7$? Cant be anything but manipulation"
"Still negative sentiment in premarket. Share price reflects lower. No rebound at all. Everyone praises Kare. Kare reduced debt which is a common practice by all CEOs and CFOs in restructuring a debt ridden company. After that he has actually done nothing. Shareholders are hurting. Kare received a raise in his compensation. Basically paying him with additional collateral loses by the shareholders. I ask time and time again, why doesn’t he accept compensation based on pay for performance method. It could be worth a lot more in the long run if he fully believes in his strategy. Why does he not purchase any shares in the open market if he truly believes in his strategy in this company. It would show confidence to the shareholders.Everyone on this praises him for keeping the share price to 20-25 year lows.As a Controller myself, I believe he took us strategically as far as he could. We need a management shakeup. A CEO who is more aggressively to defend against the daily negative sentiment. At this stage, lawyers are attempting to negotiate strategic settlements in Opiod litigation. The plan is intact. What harm is a management shakeup. We need to do this to avoid Berkshire Hathaway selling off their position. If WB sees the opportunity loss so far in Teva and does not see a near end, it may happen. Then Teva will be far below 25 year lows"
"bought more today to bring average cost down. don't see any negative fundamental change' only the opposite. now holding 20,000 at about 12$.Long and holding. believe I'll see a positive return in 2 months, and significant upside after. but waiting is becoming frustrating....hope for news about settlement or positive CA trial outcome soon"
Here's the key: they are doing a debt offering. That wouldn't be possible if the opioid overhang were truly onerous. This is muy importante.
"I too cost averaged today. it looks like a long road to recovery...maybe 2-3 yrs, but I'm prepared to wait."
"Short term driver (between now and the end of 2021):An interim CA court decision by Judge Wilson can move TEVA up or down in a significant way. So if you think TEVA (and other pharma) will receive favorable ruling from Judge Wilson, then there is no reason to worry."
The ship has come out of the storm. Clear sailing ahead.
"TEVA just lost in a tax trial in Israel that potentaily would cost her houndreds of millions NIS.apperantlly they were using ""locked earning"" that enjoy tax benefits in their foriegn company equizitions they made in the past. The court said that this tax benefit was given in order to invest those earnings inside Israel, and since they were used for aquisitions abroad, TEVA shoul pay the tax...."
"Teva's consensus eps last 4 quarter's.  green, green , blue = met, Red  = miss. "
"I recommend reading the interview with CFO Eli Kalif from July 28.Teva's CFO: ""There is no indication that the cost of the settlement will be higher than $ 900 million""I will try to summarize the article in the comments since I cannot post the link on Yahoo."
"I am sure investors are spooked and feel this is dead money however, upon opioid settlement at any point this is at least a 40% turn from here. I’ll take that in the next 5 months?"
"Well you all wanted volume and you got it. Someone leaked something, tomorrow will be interesting"
If Mr. Market is wrong about tomorrow's earnings we will see this stock bounce 10% easily.
waiting to buy more shares. this company is strong and healthy. read all recent reports with both eyes open and understand the numbers. it's an extremely healthy business and the market will acknowledge that at some point (i couldn't care less about the opiod lawsuits. they will pass at some point). for me i just hope to collect more at 8 or even below
I bought 90k shares at the close for $9.03 so we shall see how that goes
"To all shorts and stock holdersnear Teva's 52 week low of 8,24 year achievementsits net debt about 2B lowerits ebitda about 2B betterall about $2 per sharesettled some states, others are willing to settle (even Kare will always say they are 12 month away, they are much closer)better in every aspectit is NYSE best bargain"
cutting debt=good. not spending money you don't have=good. increasing free cash flow and margins=good. how many companies do you know with 16 billion in sales with a share price under 9. most people whether they know it or not are currently or have taken a teva generic. Americans and Europeans only getting older and needing more drugs. I'm accumulating at these prices and confident in my conviction.
I would love to see TEVA reverse course and allocate several billion for stock buybacks
"From Barrons, Oct. 27, Teva CEO Says He’s Still Hoping For a Nationwide Opioid SettlementSchultz said that the company could come to more state-by-state settlements. “It doesn’t hurt us to do it,” he said. Still, he said, the company is continuing to work toward a national settlement. “We’re still in very active dialogue with both the [attorneys general] and the plaintiff’s lawyers,” he said. Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson ‘s move to declare bankruptcy of a subsidiary created to hold its liabilities in the ongoing consumer litigation over its talc-based products raised questions about whether opioid defendants might try the same maneuver. Schultz said that Teva hadn’t considered it.“I’m still optimistic that we can reach a frankly nationwide settlement,” Schultz said. “Such an initiative… is not really needed or relevant for us,” he said of the maneuver Johnson & Johnson is trying, known colloquially as the Texas Two-Step due to its reliance on a particular Texas law.“I don’t know whether it could be done in theory, but I think you do that if you’re facing theoretically unsustainable levels of…cost,” Schultz said. “But that’s not the case the way I see our situation.”"
Today we make back yesterday losses + and tomorrow we close above $10
"Sandoz blamed a ""weak cough and cold"" season -- because so many people are wearing masks. Even if this affects other generic companies -- all the stocks are down on this result -- it's temporary.I took advantage of this stock going to the pivot, and added another 12,500.What a deal."
"Seems a lot of focus is on volume of shares traded daily. Let’s say today 10 millions shares were traded, would that be significant, or 16 million. No, that would only be 1.6 % of shares outstanding. The message is most shares traded daily is day traders. No one is selling their shares because the feel it’s a bad investment. All just needs to wait for this to unfold. When you see 100 million traded, you will know something has happened and shares price will swing significantly."
When the time comes this stock will triple in 1 week that is why you own this stock and don’t trade it. My guess is that it will happen between now an 6 month but don’t buy option buy shares.
"The pre and post ER move down is largely mistaken, ER was OK, steady as she goes."

"October 15, 2021 - Notice Of Motion of Teva for Order to quash the NY State's Subpoenas for records custodians""On October 13, 2021, 19 months after the close of fact discovery, 15 weeks after the start of trial, and 15 days after the State rested its case--in-chief, the State issued two subpoenas to appear on October 18, seeking the testimony of Records Custodians from Cephalon and Teva “pertaining to the storage and collection of the parody videos”. (A Few Good Men, Pain Lingers, Glengarry Glen Ross, Austin Powers)The contents of the parody videos are not facts, they are jokes. And in the context of a trial, where the jury is being asked to weigh evidence from dozens of sworn live witnesses, hours of designated depositions, and extensive corporate records, it is inherently misleading to present these jokes along-side sworn statements of fact and ask the Jury to not conflate the two. Indeed, as this Court correctly recognized, the videos are parody, which is, “defined as a literary or musical work in which the style of an author or work is closely imitated for comic effect or in ridicule.”The only potentially relevant facts regarding the parody videos (i.e., facts about who created them, what purpose were they created for, how, when, where, and why were they used, etc.) are facts that could only be established through a witness with personal knowledge of their creation and use, which the State admittedly, and purposefully, failed to even try to procure in more than four years of discovery.If not offered for their truth, and if not offered alongside testimony concerning their purpose and use, the videos have no relevance.Even if permitted, the record custodian testimony sought, at most, would establish authenticity. It would not suffice to establish the requisite foundation to properly introduce these documents into evidence. Put another way, the videos may be authentic, but they are still subject to the requirements of foundation, which require a witness who can testify as to the context, meaning, purpose, and general relevance of the evidence."""
I do see motivation for the company to continue to hide earnings until the settlements are in place. I am not an accountant so dont ask me how. I own shares and have leaps. I would love to see the blow away earnings and win their litigations but I expect middle of the road. It is oversold making a good opportunity for those with patience and long term outlook.
Just entered 400 shares will add another 400 over the next 2 weeks and maybe another 400 in jan if prices can stay this low. If I get an annual bonus this year I’ll add another 1000 shares

"I hold this stock for years now, always waiting for a big turnaround, when Kare was elected in 2017 I was certain this company would be as strong as it was, now I can say I was wrong, it’s hopeless, now only waiting for a miracle.

"bought alot more today, up to 20k shares now. one thing in cc that got my attention is the long lasting respirodal injection, one month or three months. I know first hand how expensive the long lasting antisychotitc meds are and am guessing this will be meaningful addition to the Teva portfolio. also. first time heard CEO on the cc in action. since like rock solid exec. just what Teva needs to continue executing on big long term turn around. given sales, cash flows and everything else. - and factoring opioid litigation overhang, at this price seems very good risk reward profile."
I also have a 1000 shares of VIAC. Same amount of disappointment. I am more concerned about VIAC than TEVA but they are on par as far as losses.
"Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) is scheduled to announce Q3 earnings results on Wednesday, October 27th, before market open.The consensus EPS Estimate is $0.65 (+12.1% Y/Y) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $4.05B (+1.3% Y/Y).Over the last 2 years, TEVA has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 50% of the time."
It will turn green by close. Nobody short wants to be holding over the weekend. I would love to hear that settlement is done right after closing today. Shorts would be fried on Monday

"Teva’s earnings underperformance again, again with Kare’s non inspirational conference Call and interviews allowed Teva to take 3 steps back in share price, again! But he gets paid his 20 million annually nevertheless"
Someone with deep pockets is driving this down. No reason for this much pressure unless the opiod settlement is going to be much larger than expected.
Dropped nearly two percent in a green market on 600k volume
Who cares about earning its all about a settlement that is coming very soon
Anyone investing in Teva should just drive down the highway and throw their money out the window. Same rate of return.

"What has happened with me so many times is I buy stocks cheaply only to sell right before they finally (after a year or two of waiting) rally and I miss the whole thing. This happened in oil and gas and I literally gave away $800K in profits by selling in Q4 of last year. I can't forgive myself for that and never will.Teva is another animal. Someone here suggested that they want that share price suppressed. It would not surprise me one bit. The insane manipulation in all things these days is not conspiracy but truth.I am going to hold forever at this point and maybe one day, I can give up this addiction."
"J&J just announced opioid settlement in TEXAS. Perhaps J&J coughing up money rattles some TEVA holders. The settlement wasn't terrible, but money was paid and nobody likes to hear that!"
Also for everyone who thinks this is insider trading is wrong. Novartis's generic unit underperformed this quarter and someone sold off speculating that teva would face headwinds this quarter based on those results.

i am long TEVA but losing my patience with this #$%$ the last 5 days changed my mind. horrible stock.
TEVA will be the first locally produced major pharma to be awarded the contract to produce the major drug ingredients in both EUROPE and the U.S.
I believe that ENDO's price action is a proxy for TEVA and if you want to look at the ENDP chart you will see what I mean.
"In addition to the important appeal of the Oklahoma trial where JNJ lost with the amount of $ 465 million, there is another appeal that has gone unnoticed,It is I believe the only current opioid lawsuit to be dismissed by a judge, and is currently being appealed in the Connecticut Supreme Court (SC 20313). The outcome of both appeals is imminent."
So someone ask me to sell my stocks for 8.69 i told him the stocks value is 24This is what we have in the last daysStop thinking why this is the game
Call started
Bought additional 1200 shares of TEVA at $8.98. Thanks short men
You are kidding yourself if you think there will be an earnings run up- wall street doesnt care to hear teva barely beat earnings and a settlement is around the corner for the 12th quarter in a row

"JERUSALEM, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it was highly doubtful the company would co-produce COVID-19 vaccines or drugs to treat the illness, its chief executive officer said on Wednesday.“When it comes to new antivirals, we don’t have plans to do research there. Of course, once they come off patents we will be doing generics ... but we have no plans of doing innovative R&D into COVID” treatments, Schultz told Reuters after issuing third-quarter financial results. “We have had no discussions on COVID-19 blocks.”When asked whether Teva was interested in buying Sandoz, which may be on the block, from Novatris, Schultz said Teva “doesn’t have any money so we are not in the market for any companies” and “there is quite an overlap between our biosimilars portfolios.”He also said Teva intended to rapidly pay down its more than $20 billion debt until it reaches $10-$12 billion, which at the current pace should be around 2025"
over $15 once the opioid settlement is coming down. just be patient.
Last chance buying opportunity for those who want to get in under $10
The stock price will hover around $10 until the legal issues are resolved. Why anyone thinks differently is not logical at this point. JMHO

"Chicken out before the earning tomorrow. Let wait and see, don't act too soon."
"Snagged some more shares today, still my second largest holding. Stay calm investors, still VERY bullish."
I am long Teva and very bullish of the restructuring FY 2023+. The negative sentiment from the call yesterday from my perspective is the hard realization of many that the opioid resolution is probably 12 months away as opposed to several weeks. The company’s pipeline is strengthening. Revenue diversification is strengthening. Recurring revenues from new products strengthening. Margins strengthening. Free cash flow strengthening. Debt reduction in line with plan - reduce debt to less 3x ebitda by end of 2023. Ceo will not make acquisitions until debt is less than 2x EBITDA (not in formal plan). Yes I see this stock at $42-$52 by end of 2023 / 2024 if not acquired immediately post resolution of opioid litigation. Good luck!
"What is everyones average and how many shares? 4000 shares, $10.2 average."
"Earning $0.59 for the under $10 stock, not that bad in overall. As of 09/30/2021, the debt was $23,746 millions compared $25,132 millions as of 06/30/2021. Great achievement by TEVA managements and employees."
Nice that they explained how their generic portfolio is different than sandboz and is less effected
"no news to justify this drop,so with no apparent reason - manipulation."
i think we are going lower after maybe a bounce. the weakness and depth of sell-off is signalling another shoe to drop
Full year 2021 business outlook reaffirmedNet revenues of $16.0 - $16.4 billionAdjusted EBITDA of $4.8 - $5.1 billionEPS of $2.50 - $2.70Free cash flow of $2.0 - $2.3 billion
A slight miss in one quarter during a pandemic where many TEVA customers were in lockdown is not a negative.
"North America Gross Profit""Gross profit from our North America segment in the second quarter of 2021 was $1,040million, a decrease of 5%, compared to $1,090 million in the second quarter of 2020. Thisdecrease was mainly due to lower gross profit from Anda and COPAXONE""so only 5% down compared to 20% of Novartis US genericsWell done."
Interesting sell-off prior to earnings. Not sure if something is up here. Just patiently waiting on eventual settlement...but it might take a lot longer than planned. Have been holding a long time already.
"Added another 35000 shares at $9.44 now total 420,000 shares double in less then 6 months settlement is coming very soon"
"I love the so called analysts who tell me the past, they downgrade the stock when it has already been decimated, not when the stock was trading in the 30's.Analysts told you that retail stocks are dead in the water (in 2020) in the area of Amazon,when Macy's last year was trading around $6 we were told it's going to $2, a year laterit's around $26 + dividend."
Am I missing something? Kare is the savior but it is not reflected in the earnings reports. He wanted a raise and got it awhile back.
"The world’s largest generic drug company needs to recapture its former greatness. Where there’s the will, there’s a way. GLTA"
Maybe manipulation to allow the shorts to cover before good earnings tomorrow??
Great looking price action today. Probability is very good that TEVA goes higher tomorrow as it tries to break through that $10.25-10.45 overhead supply
Looks like $9 TEVA may be over. Sure was fun while it lasted.
"October 17, 2021 - CORRESPONDENCE (from Teva) TO JUDGE""After sitting through 13 weeks of Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief, including their presentation of 31 witnesses and more than 600 exhibits, Plaintiffs waited only 6 trial days (3 of which were consumed by Plaintiffs’ cross examination of Defendants’ very first witness) to begin complaining of “cumulative” evidence in Defendants’ case. The Plaintiffs’ hypocrisy is stunning. And, as explained below, it is also consistent with their larger strategy of interfering with Defendants’ case through gamesmanship and hollow complaints. We begin with the hypocrisy. Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief was cumulative, unwieldy and disorganized from the start. For example for Cephalon, Plaintiffs:-Called 7 different witnesses just to testify about Cephalon’s sales and marketing practices -Introduced testimony regarding misdemeanor guilty plea through 4 different witnesses -Displayed the same 3 exhibits to 4 witnesses (2005 Marketing Plan, a single sentence from a 2008 Fentora sales training module, and an APF Guide to Chronic Pain).-The centerpiece of Plaintiffs’ own case was a cardboard demonstrative on which they asked 6 different fact witnesses the exact same questions. Distilled to its core, Plaintiffs’ case is built upon very few pieces of evidence about which they elicited identical testimony from multiple witnesses.Evidence is not “cumulative” merely because two different witnesses testify regarding the same set of facts or document. For example, counsel for Nassau County objected to testimony regarding NY Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement practices and policies as “cumulative”, since Plaintiffs had called Josh Vinciguerra in their case. This completely ignores that Mr. Vinciguerra was the State’s 11-f designee and a clearly hostile witness to the defense. He was extensively prepared by Plaintiffs’ counsel before his testimony. Defendants have every right to present evidence from other BNE employees (not 11-f designees) regarding their personal knowledge of the same or similar subject matters about which Mr. Vinciguerra was questioned. Plaintiffs may not properly deem a witness to be “cumulative” merely because he or she testifies about a subject area that has been previously addressed by another witness. The jury has every right, and is indeed entitled, to hear differing viewpoints on the same or similar subject matter. Such evidence is not “cumulative”.Although the determination as to whether evidence is cumulative rests with the discretion of the trial court, the misapplication of that discretion may be grounds for a new trial. While it is evident that Plaintiffs do not like that the jury is hearing evidence that is detrimental to their case, they have no right to control the manner or means by which Defendants present their defenses, nor is it proper for them to attempt to comment on the nature of the evidence by suggesting to the jury that it is “cumulative”. Plaintiffs also have no right to dictate that a given witness be presented by video or read-in deposition. Defendants certainly did not have that right during Plaintiffs’ case-in-chief.In addition to the improper “cumulative” objections, it has quickly become clear that Plaintiffs’ intent is to interfere with the Defendant’s presentation of the case as much as possible through frivolous, collateral attacks rather than on the merits of the evidence which they know is unfavorable to them. For instance, Plaintiffs have been independently corresponding with all of the settled defendants regarding the use of deposition testimony from their employees, in what appears to be a transparent effort to encourage those settled entities which are no longer parties to this case to intervene. Defendants also have reason to believe that Plaintiffs have independently contacted the DEA regarding the Defendants’ use of DEA depositions and clearance under the Touhy regulations for use of same, despite Plaintiffs having already used DEA testimony in their own case without first seeking or being granted such DEA clearance. All of this is transparent and improper gamesmanship."""
Very painful to hold this stock over period of 1-3 years. Testing everyone patience levels...
I really thought the rolling over of near term debt would be a big plus for the stock. Apparently not.
I am long TEVA. Missing expectations is never fruitful on the stock side. There are several key strengths - product portfolio diversification both on revenue and pipeline is strengthening. Debt reduction. Restructuring plan is on track. The stock will take several weeks to stabilize. It will be in the range prior to reporting when it does. Sure we might dip below $9 but focus on what is taking place long term and the forward trajectory to determine if the next several days present an outstanding buying opportunity. Good luck to all longs and be balanced on how you digest the messages on this board - I reckon most are well intentioned - but are handicapped by lack of experience and reality. Good luck to all longs.
"Soooooo frustrated with this...and even though I hold a lot of this my average buy-in is 9.02 and it 's been a long almost 3 years.....but I don't need the money for quite a while, and ultimately this will pay off....and well....PATIENCE. PATIENCE. PATIENCE."
