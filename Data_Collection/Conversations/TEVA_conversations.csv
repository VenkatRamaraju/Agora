"To all shorts and stock holdersnear Teva's 52 week low of 8,24 year achievementsits net debt about 2B lowerits ebitda about 2B betterall about $2 per sharesettled some states, others are willing to settle (even Kare will always say they are 12 month away, they are much closer)better in every aspectit is NYSE best bargain"
Someone with deep pockets is driving this down. No reason for this much pressure unless the opiod settlement is going to be much larger than expected.
"Let me repeat myself in another way. Can TEVA sell $4 billion of bonds if there is a major opioid overhang?Obviously they have something positive to say about that issue, which they will no doubt share with potential purchasers. In theory, those purchasers will then have ""inside information,"" and thus won't be able to buy stock. But that never quite keeps them from stepping out, or ""telling their friends.""So I bought another 20,000 in front of that.Just my opinion, but think about it. Who would buy debt if there is a potential for a negative outcome re: opioids?"
"Why don’t we do Reddit type trade of our own? Let us all buy Teva which is unfairly undervalued and manipulated 16.4 billion revenue, 2.3 billion fcf trading at just 8.7$? Cant be anything but manipulation"
"Loaded hard last 3 days. I hope everyone else did too. Remember everyone were all on the same team, whether you bought 1 share or 100,000 shares."
"A trip down memory lane with Erez Vidogman, August 4, 2016. Actavis purchase for 40.5 billion, market cap of Teva now under 10 billion:Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA will remain in the hunt for more acquisitions after completing a deal to buy Allergan's AGN.N generics business for $40.5 billion this week.Teva expects to generate free cash flow of more than $25 billion through 2019 from the integration of Actavis, $5 billion of which will go towards dividend payouts.“The rest will be divided between paying down debt and entertaining attractive specialty deals,” Erez Vidogman, Teva’s chief executive, told a conference call of analysts following the publication of second-quarter results."
"From Barrons, Oct. 27, Teva CEO Says He’s Still Hoping For a Nationwide Opioid SettlementSchultz said that the company could come to more state-by-state settlements. “It doesn’t hurt us to do it,” he said. Still, he said, the company is continuing to work toward a national settlement. “We’re still in very active dialogue with both the [attorneys general] and the plaintiff’s lawyers,” he said. Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson ‘s move to declare bankruptcy of a subsidiary created to hold its liabilities in the ongoing consumer litigation over its talc-based products raised questions about whether opioid defendants might try the same maneuver. Schultz said that Teva hadn’t considered it.“I’m still optimistic that we can reach a frankly nationwide settlement,” Schultz said. “Such an initiative… is not really needed or relevant for us,” he said of the maneuver Johnson & Johnson is trying, known colloquially as the Texas Two-Step due to its reliance on a particular Texas law.“I don’t know whether it could be done in theory, but I think you do that if you’re facing theoretically unsustainable levels of…cost,” Schultz said. “But that’s not the case the way I see our situation.”"
"I love the so called analysts who tell me the past, they downgrade the stock when it has already been decimated, not when the stock was trading in the 30's.Analysts told you that retail stocks are dead in the water (in 2020) in the area of Amazon,when Macy's last year was trading around $6 we were told it's going to $2, a year laterit's around $26 + dividend."
"Still negative sentiment in premarket. Share price reflects lower. No rebound at all. Everyone praises Kare. Kare reduced debt which is a common practice by all CEOs and CFOs in restructuring a debt ridden company. After that he has actually done nothing. Shareholders are hurting. Kare received a raise in his compensation. Basically paying him with additional collateral loses by the shareholders. I ask time and time again, why doesn’t he accept compensation based on pay for performance method. It could be worth a lot more in the long run if he fully believes in his strategy. Why does he not purchase any shares in the open market if he truly believes in his strategy in this company. It would show confidence to the shareholders.Everyone on this praises him for keeping the share price to 20-25 year lows.As a Controller myself, I believe he took us strategically as far as he could. We need a management shakeup. A CEO who is more aggressively to defend against the daily negative sentiment. At this stage, lawyers are attempting to negotiate strategic settlements in Opiod litigation. The plan is intact. What harm is a management shakeup. We need to do this to avoid Berkshire Hathaway selling off their position. If WB sees the opportunity loss so far in Teva and does not see a near end, it may happen. Then Teva will be far below 25 year lows"
"Teva and the German MODAG will collaborate in the development of a cure for a rare disease of the nervous system Under the agreement, Teva will receive an exclusive global license for the development, production and marketing of the drugs."
"I just bought 19 Kshrs more. I am now somewhere over 100K Shrs. My cost basis is under $9.90I am solid in my conviction that this is worth FAR more than the current price. Yes, do the multiplication. That's how much I have invested in this."
"Bought another 1000 shares today @$8.56. Again, earning $0.59 for stock trading at this price, I don't think we will have many opportunities like this."
"bought more today to bring average cost down. don't see any negative fundamental change' only the opposite. now holding 20,000 at about 12$.Long and holding. believe I'll see a positive return in 2 months, and significant upside after. but waiting is becoming frustrating....hope for news about settlement or positive CA trial outcome soon"
I am long TEVA. Missing expectations is never fruitful on the stock side. There are several key strengths - product portfolio diversification both on revenue and pipeline is strengthening. Debt reduction. Restructuring plan is on track. The stock will take several weeks to stabilize. It will be in the range prior to reporting when it does. Sure we might dip below $9 but focus on what is taking place long term and the forward trajectory to determine if the next several days present an outstanding buying opportunity. Good luck to all longs and be balanced on how you digest the messages on this board - I reckon most are well intentioned - but are handicapped by lack of experience and reality. Good luck to all longs.
"Looks like the bottom is in and the buying has begun. TEVA will pop when they reach a settlement, and I believe a settlement will come. TEVA is such a big supplier of cheap generic drugs, the world can ill afford to put them out of business."
I am long Teva and very bullish of the restructuring FY 2023+. The negative sentiment from the call yesterday from my perspective is the hard realization of many that the opioid resolution is probably 12 months away as opposed to several weeks. The company’s pipeline is strengthening. Revenue diversification is strengthening. Recurring revenues from new products strengthening. Margins strengthening. Free cash flow strengthening. Debt reduction in line with plan - reduce debt to less 3x ebitda by end of 2023. Ceo will not make acquisitions until debt is less than 2x EBITDA (not in formal plan). Yes I see this stock at $42-$52 by end of 2023 / 2024 if not acquired immediately post resolution of opioid litigation. Good luck!
"I am long and have a large position and added more on Thursday(not a lot)...why, because these prices are just so low and the company keeps executing. I know revenues were soft but even with those soft revenues, FCF was 700 million for the qtr.... Also I just don't get why the refinancing through this bond offering did not get more positive attention...also the executives tried to get the analysts to focus on margin and not revenues and tried to explain how their generic portfolio is different than sandoz"
cutting debt=good. not spending money you don't have=good. increasing free cash flow and margins=good. how many companies do you know with 16 billion in sales with a share price under 9. most people whether they know it or not are currently or have taken a teva generic. Americans and Europeans only getting older and needing more drugs. I'm accumulating at these prices and confident in my conviction.
"bought alot more today, up to 20k shares now. one thing in cc that got my attention is the long lasting respirodal injection, one month or three months. I know first hand how expensive the long lasting antisychotitc meds are and am guessing this will be meaningful addition to the Teva portfolio. also. first time heard CEO on the cc in action. since like rock solid exec. just what Teva needs to continue executing on big long term turn around. given sales, cash flows and everything else. - and factoring opioid litigation overhang, at this price seems very good risk reward profile."
Bought additional 1200 shares of TEVA at $8.98. Thanks short men
