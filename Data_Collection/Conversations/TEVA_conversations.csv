Nice mid day volume.
This is fantastic news. More to follow in the same long term payout which is minimally harming. Their future looks great.
stock action indicate mediation going on
I very much like that closing without the usual sell off
1 month endo return 53%1 month teva return 4.41%Gives us hope... They settled NY
Really really small volume no needed to matter
Frustrating day but it make senseAll Teva is about these days is news on the state of legal extorsion and if there are no news then anxiety sets in.
TEVA CEO Kare Shultz expects to see some significant growth after 2023. It doesn't let me add the link so just find it on Google: Kåre Schultz- Serial Problem Solver
"Watch the TA for short term changes...RSI at 67...highest its been in 6 months...Longe term this stock is all about the settlement, short-term...with no more news will likely start to chill for a bit....as for myself...long and holding"
Teva just gave their appeal in a patent despute against Cort and it didn't go well which is why Teva is giving up gains.
"Markets are set to go down.Until 7:00 almost zero pre trading, which means Teva investors and potential Teva investors are in wait and see mood. I believe that if Teva goes down it will pick up during the day or it just might edge higher. anything is possible based on legal rumor's drip drop. Will see how Teva will hold."
"This decision proves that this was just a political issue from the very beginning, Even though this is a small sample of what to expect from the rest of the process I would risk saying that Teva should be heading much higher now."
ENDP settled in NY for 50 million....they marketed and sold a branded drug...TEVA did not....sold generics...this is potentially good news for TEVA...but again...not a global settlement
"As we know, Anda, owned by Teva, is also a defendant in the opioid lawsuits.Again, to share with you the despair of the plaintiffs in NY, I present to you Dr. Keyes, the main (and only) witness against Anda. As an additional fact, Anda was also part of Allergan and now as a bad mother she denies her daughter. September 26 - Motion Requesting to Strike TestimonyDefendant “Anda” writes concerning the testimony of Dr. Katherine Keyes. Dr. Keyes offered impermissible, highly prejudicial opinion testimony concerning Anda that was both undisclosed and without foundation. On recross, Dr. Keyes admitted the following: 1. Dr. Keyes knows only that Anda is a distributor in this case and “nothing” else about it. 2. She does not recall ever considering any Anda-produced document. 3. She did not assess Anda’s contribution to the opioid supply relative to other distributors.4. Dr. Keyes has “absolutely no idea” of the quantity of opioids Anda distributed into Nassau and Suffolk Counties. (Anda is not charged by NY)5. When Dr. Keyes told the jury that Anda caused the opioid crisis, the sole basis of her opinion was that Anda is a distributor, despite admitting that there are legitimate uses for opioids, and disavowing any opinion that every pill shipped caused the opioid crisis. Given that Dr. Keyes testified that there is a legitimate medical use for prescription opioid medications, and that the cause of the opioid crisis is actually the oversupply of these medications (as opposed to the fact of their mere existence), it defies logic for Dr. Keyes to assert that Anda’s distribution of opioids, in and of itself, contributed to a crisis. Her admissions indisputably demonstrate that any purported expert opinion as to Anda lacks the requisite foundation to render it admissible. Dr. Keyes cannot credibly testify that Anda contributed to an oversupply with absolutely no idea of the quantity Anda distributed, and her testimony should be stricken.*****6 Oct - COURT NOTICE concerning testimony of Dr. KeyesThis Court declines to grant a mistrial or strike the testimony of Dr. Keyes. The weight to be accorded expert testimony is a matter for the jury.""A jury is not required to accept an expert's opinion to the exclusion of the facts and circumstances disclosed by other testimony and/or the facts disclosed on cross-examination .... Indeed, a jury is at liberty to reject an expert's opinion if it finds the facts to be different from those which formed the basis for the opinion or if, after careful consideration of all the evidence in the case, it disagrees with the opinion."". This all goes to the weight of the expert testimony, not its admissibility. This Court has already directed the jury that although it will, from time to time, hear testimony concerning Manufacturers or Distributors generally, such evidence must be connected to a particular defendant before that defendant may be found liable.The denial is without prejudice to Anda seeking an appropriate jury instruction at a charging conference."
"The Louisiana settlement infers a settlement with the rest of the other states of 900 million to 1.5 billion, my assumption is based on states like New York or California will require settlement substantially higher. Regardless it appears the settlement will be more than manageable over an 18 year period. Think TEVA is sending a message that they are willing to pursue reasonable settlements but also ready to aggressively defend with states that have greedy lawyers or AG’s trying to obtain political gain for themselves."
"Teva separates from about 200 employees in Kfar Saba: ""Business circumstances are binding""The pharmaceutical company notes that most of the employees who leave will receive early retirement conditions, and moreover, compensation packages will be granted ""above and beyond the requirements of the law and collective agreements"".From globes. The cost cutting continues"
"For the past week Teva is holding on about 10.2$, Waiting for a new piece of news, where is the legal extortion is heading to, if nothing comes I assume it will slide down a little or flow with the market until the ER.On real big new Teva will pop a lot (13-15) and on some little good news trickle it will edge to 11 until ER."

California judge questions counties' opioid case against drugmakers at trial's end
BIG RED DAY AND TEVA IN THE GREEN 
PIMCO manager Bill Gross says one of the biggest threats to an investor is the emotional roller coaster of watching the stock market on a daily basis
"Added substantial today, think conference call is going to be the long awaited continuous uptrend in share price. Could be wrong, but do know time to buy at these prices is almost up. When Kare came on board we’re in bad shape, after we saw he had a plan to pay down the debt, we were at 26pps, then the opioid problem. Now debt has been drastically reduced. and with the first settlement obtained and more to come. Once the street can see the end of the tunnel,, this will easily be back at that 26 pps and beyond."
As I stated after the LA. News….if there is no others news TEVA would driftI have owned this stock for 4 years…I know it wellIt’s not moving above 10.45 unless there is more significant news…period
nice plug for Teva:https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/10/08/5-warren-buffett-stocks-to-buy-for-fourth-quarter/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo
"Teva has reached an agreement in principle with Louisiana on the settlement of the lawsuit in the opioid case Under the agreement, Teva will pay $ 15 million over 18 years and donate $ 3 million in painkillers."
"Adjusting for the Louisiana population, it would imply a global settlement of $1.3bn. Thank you shorts."
hard to imagine who's still selling at this point. Certainly seems like an asymmetric risk profile to be short.

Low Friday volume but still green We need some new piece of good news next week to keep the momentum
"No sense at all. Price that is trading at now.. During the second quarter of 2021, the company brought in $3.9 billion in revenue and $625 million in free cash flow -- roughly unchanged from last year's quarter. However, it's important to note that whatever bad news investors expect is already baked into Teva's stock price and then some. In fact, you could buy shares for as little as 3.6 times forward earnings and 0.6 times forward revenue."
Going up with low volume but I will take it just the same.
"How many companies with improving metrics have a PEG ratio of .79 and are selling for more than half a buck less than book value? This stock is a no-brainer if you can wait for it. I expect it to soar when they reintroduce the dividend, but concede it won't be until uncertainties get cleared up."
"Teva share price is an absolute steal at this level, if you ignore 2 basic problems : opioid litigation and debt.a) Regarding opioid, Teva will likely have to pay about $2B payable in 18 years which although bitter is manageable.b) Regarding debt, Teva is paying down its debt in an orderly manner, making the rollover of outstanding bonds very possible. Besides less debt means less interest payment that go straight into profits.By 2023 Teva will have most legal problems behind it and be a lean and mean operation making an attractive profit, also likely paying a dividend."
"""Teva’s generic drug business excites Miller with the company only trading at 7x earnings and an expectation that it will spike when a settlement is reached in the pharmaceutical space around the opioid crisis""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbisnoff/2021/10/04/value-investor-bill-miller-makes-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-names-stock-picks-at-forbesshook-top-advisor-summit/?sh=1dbf838c1646"
"Aside from the fundamentals, TEVA has formed a double bottom that is noticed by technicians. The buy point for a double bottom occurs at the inflection point that connects the two bottoms. It appears to me that this point is around $10.25-30 and that the $10.45 price point is clear of the overhead supply."
Excellent news…hopefully more to come
Someone try to shake out weak hands? Two more news this morning and they are good news and the stock drop? Please take this back down to 9 or below 9 so I can buy more shares.
"TEVA can reach a global settlement in the upcoming weeks. Once there is a global settlement for the distributions & JNJ, and there are settlements made with other companies that can be used as a work-frame for a global settlement with all states (such as ENDP recent settlement in the NY trial), it's achievable at any day. The NY trial won't less for long when only AbbVie and TEVA are left."
"Once you start to see the “going to the moon” crowd talking up a name, to me means going down in short term."
"Approaching 100K volume in pre trading, the most since 28-Jul-21 (post ER 12% jump day) which was 223K,so according to pre trading volume estimation, today may be a 3%-6% up.Again, no rules, any thing can happen in a specific day, up or down."
MarketEdge Second Opinion Weekly upgrades TEVA to LONG from Neutral on 10/01/21. There always have a light at the end of the tunnel for the 100 years old company.
"Nice. early premarket trading in any volume and green is a good sign. There is rarely any trading in TEVA this early. We are also on the Yahoo trending list (I know who cares) but news and trading interest may force some shorts to cover, keep this recent uptrend moving."
So Teva bounced off the 20 day EMA exactly today and for now formed a doji signaling selling pressure is decreasing. We will now see tomorrow if it is the same turd Teva going all the way back down or if it is now forming a new uptrend. If it is a new trend it should put in a bullish engulfing candle tomorrow into the $9.90's
10.20 was a slam dunk sell area as it was previous resistance in Aug. Gonna buy it back on a backtest of $10 and especially because of the weekly options expiring tomorrow at the $10 strike
it is going up now
"Schultz comes with the package. I believe he is looking long term. so his strategy is clear. reduce debt. solve litigations, either by settlement or by trial, reduce cost and keep alive Teva. (In his strategy, I dont see short term stock price)So if you like this package, welcome. If not there are many stocks all aroundSo far has done a good job"
"UnitedHealth shares up premarket after earnings beat estimates, raises guidanceUnitedHealth Group Inc. shares jumped 1.7% in premarket trade Thursday, after the health benefits company beat earnings estimates for the third quarter and raised its guidance. The company posted net income of $4.086 billion, or $4.28 a share, up from $3.172 billion, or $3.30 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $4.52, ahead of the $4.41 FactSet consensus. Revenue rose to $72.337 billion from $65.115 billion, also ahead of the $71.347 billion FactSet consensus"
"How Teva is still below 10 after the Louisiana settlement is beyond me. They got little cash, stretched out payments and drugs in lieu of cash. I predict global settlement quickly as the state's prosecutors know what they can realistically get."
What is going on with New York? Everything has been quiet since big three and endo settlement....no news on trial either?
"Option manipulation revisit. I notice decent volumes for 10 and 10.5 call options today. Teva is being set up to close either at/near 10 or 10.5 by EOD tomorrow (Friday, 10/8/21) and it all depends on market makers’ positions on these 10 and 10.5 call options."
Great news and this is only the beginning.Go TEVA !

"teva to pay 15M over 8 years, additional 3M donation"
I think that clearing the $9.65 level is a big step but there are around 200mm shares traded between $10 and $10.20 that must clear out before a great run can occur.
The business keep getting more profitable As Teva announced they kick 200 employees at Kfar Saba
Well i like when i see articles against investment in teva And also a manipulation in pre market
I believe we can see a 11 dollars Before earnings and after 12-13$
Some one just bought 1M stock on 9:49same thing happened the day before
"Google ""Alvotech Beats Back AbbVie’s Trade Secrets Lawsuit"".... probably reason it's up today"
"Pre trading volume for 5:30 is 32K, like the 28-Jul-21 volume for that time, 38k,that day ended up 12% and during the day reached 15%.So up 5-10% is not a bad volume guided guess, but there are no rules, anything can happen.But anything can happen, there are no rules."
The volume and drop is driven by algo on the bloomberg news released one hour ago:Teva Recalls U.S.-Made Drugs Following Contamination FearsFDA probe finds water-leak damage and relaxed safety protocols at California factoryIt should have close to zero impact on the stock imo.
12 opioid defendants now down to two including Teva. No way this will go on for months. Everyone wants it over with and done. I'm convinced news of a settlement is any day.
https://www.law360.com/articles/1429531/teva-gets-bayer-s-cancer-drug-patent-invalidated-in-uk
Double digits do look nice.Still a ways to go before the big final settlement imho but things finally seem to be getting interesting again.
i think next settlement will involve couple of states
"Last week option and its potential influence on today share price. Since TEVA held up nicely (16 cents over $10 call strike price) by EOD on option expiration 10/8/21, my guess is those traders and market makers who exercised their call contracts @ 10 over the weekend will then sell their newly acquired shares into the open market today for some profit, and such action could create a downward pressure on the share price. Will this downward pressure exist momentarily or for the whole trading day today?"
Tomorrow we close above $11
I believe Global settlement will be after December. I read where State Attorney Generals have till December 31st to make decision. It is in everyone's best interest to have Global Settlement. From Teva last quarterly report sometime next year Global Settlement should be complete. TEVA can give little cash but free medicine is their gift to Global settlement. TEVA will be last because not giving cash. After all companies giving cash settle then TEVA settle. Free medicine is a huge gift. Next year I hope is TEVA turn to the moon! 
Teva will continue to be biggest pharmaceutical company 
"I own lots of TEVA---Been at this game a long time. NOT a day trader. My advice- Ignore all the ""experts"" /Analysts / CNBC gang / Internet stories- etc. It's a bit obvious what is eventually going to happen here. I can't tell you if it will be tomorrow or in 6 months ( I'm guessing within the next 3 months ). The settlement will be reached. When that happens the elephants will have already taken their spot in the room- Sure, you will be able to get TEVA but likely will have to pay a huge premium. Eventually it will double or triple and will happen fast. Again, this is a park money and wait deal. For those short, no problem, short away. I'm patient and am going to wait this out. Between now and the settlement the MM will do what they can to shake out the weak hands and continue to accumulate- They are experts at creating fear and doubt. D"
wow now that is a deal 15 mil over 18 years all states will follow easy double very fast
3 years from now teva will be $50 stock with 5% dividend
Great holding today bravo !
"Once again, there is absolutely no way in a civilized society that Teva should be held liable for public nuisance."
Volume 3 million in first hour of trading. Hmmm…
"Good starts for TEVA today! Other good news will follow, $15 can be reached soon."
"Where's poor Saully, who bragged about selling at $10.20 so he could buy back at $10?"
Good bye 9 hello 10s
$25 after statewide settlement
What makes people think a global settlement is imminent??Kare said it could take up to a year at the last CC..
"The market goes down, TEVA goes down. Makes sense, right? But then when the market bounces back, TEVA is still down. The only explanation is that without volume or news related to the legal issues, it is just too easy to manipulate the stock. And then you can find it drops 10% in a week while the markets are up 5%. What has changed since Jun 10 when the stock closed at 11.53$ ? 1. SP 500 was up 10% 2 .Kare Shultz said in a rare statement that there is no chance there won't be a settlement in the upcoming year. 3. Teva reaches a $925K settlement with Mississippi in a price-fixing case while estimates were for 1-2 billion fine for all lawsuits! Assuming other states will follow this settlement, TEVA will end up paying less than 50 millions ! ! !Yes, 50 million instead of 1-2 billion. The good news is that it doesn't really matter if the stock goes down or up in the short term. If you believe that after settlement and reducing the debt, fair value is 40$, you just need to stay tight. The bad news is that if you follow the stock market day by day, it will be very difficult to keep holding till the settlement or it will just drive you crazy. My advice: try to follow the news, not the stock."
Markets end the day red but Teva is green. that is a good tell sign for market sentiment and perhaps for things to come.
Listen to me guys THIS IS SO UNDERVALUED haha i mean 9.8-10.5?This is a big stone and a back for all the longs same as me i hope i can help u and get your eyes clearThis is way way cheap than it needs to be GLTA LONG TEVA
"Enough with festivities !There are people that their cost was above 15$ (not me) and Teva long is 20 - 30 $ company. 10$ for Teva is no big deal, It is actually an insult."
Not get excited the volume u will see when we reach settlement will be huge!!!
FYI - for the CA opioid trial the oral closing arguments are slated for this Thursday/Friday per Judge Wilson's original schedule. Not sure if it will be live-steamed.
Teva is the wors stock ever
"Judge to the procesution: ""whats the evidence, whats the evidence?""but says that he has to infer that it WAS the marketing that pushed doctors and patients to prescribe the opioids. there isn't evidence."
"So far there isn't much activity for 10 and 10.5 call option (Friday exp. 10/15/21), but currently there are 13623 and 7925 open interest for 10 and 10.5 calls, respectively. TEVA is currently at 9.80. Does anybody want to guess TEVA's closing price by EOD on Friday, 10/15/21?"
Rise!
"Facebook faces Legal Risk similar to Tobacco or Opioid IndustryFB has been under pressure following a series of reports that made allegations covering Instagram’s impact on teenagers’ mental health, whether its algorithm encouraged social discord, and how it moderates elites.An analyst at London-based technology industry research group, wrote Sunday that “while we have been skeptical that past revelations would lead to government action, we think this time is different and as a result, we think Facebook may now face a similar challenge from increased litigation as tobacco, or more recently, OxyContin.” Levin served as chief of staff to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission in the 1990s.The analyst said that while the facts and damages are different for Facebook than those faced by the tobacco industry or Purdue Pharma—the maker of opioid medication OxyContin—the fundamental legal framework is the same.There is a product with problematic consequences for many people, management knowledge of such, and actions by management “that not only failed to mitigate the harm but arguably increased those problematic consequences,” Levin said.While FB has faced scrutiny before, there is far more attention on the company this time, in part because of the role that harms to children plays in the recent allegations, Levin noted.“Discovery is likely to yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook, and the dynamics create an opportunity for a settlement that would address the issues more quickly than legislation,” Levin said. A company whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Journal also testified before Congress last week.BARRONS - 1 Oct"
only 23 million shares short but that is 2 days of volume. let's hope for the good news to continue
"The agreement is contingent on confirmation from the state by November 2, 2021 that all political subdivisions will release Teva as part of the settlement.Under the terms of the settlement, Teva will pay Louisiana $15 mln over an 18-year time period and will provide an additional donation of lifesaving medicines to aid in opioid addiction and recovery, valued at $3 mln (wholesale acquisition cost). Teva continues to negotiate a national settlement and remains open in parallel to pursuing opportunities with individual states such as the deal announced today, as long as it is consistent with the nationwide approach. The Company will continue to defend itself in court in states such as New York and California where we have not reached terms of a settlement agreement.Teva believes that today's settlement with Louisiana is a positive step forward in getting life-saving medicines to people suffering from opioid addiction."
if you are long don't even think of believing this stock manipulation. it's so transparent/obvious... don't buy the down trend they try to falsely show you. just keep some cash on the side and be ready to buy more when it gets below 8$ or 7$ or less. buy in small portions on every transaction (so you stay with more bullets/cash if it keeps sliding). and most important stay strong  and patience. stick to the fundamentals of this company which are really really good (and that's most important)
Does CA tenative judgement just get dropped on public in some form.... or do they give notice and announce with notice? Oklahoma took 30 days from closing arguments... we are around 14 days currently in CA.
"The LA agreement is a huge deal to benefit TEVA and shareholders, imo. I would expect the future settlement agreements to be similar in form and scope: relatively small. The company did not have any marketing campaign back in the days of relevance to the negotiations as per my recall of the comments in a long past conference call.Good luck to all!"
"From 14:30 to 15:30 4.5 Million stocks traded on the up move,That is relatively serious movement.I don't see how this can be attributed to the Fed talk so we are left with effect of index moving up and / or anticipation for settlement or a sentiment that we have reached a bottom."
A run up in sp with high volume makes you think that something is brewing.
Well I just bit the bullet once again. (I don't normally bite thou). I just bought 10K shares at 9.67Now I have close to 80K shrs. go ahead and run up to $20/share now !!
"JASPER pharma just doubled in one DAY. TEVA, the World's largest pharma should be $30.00 right now and it has 32 plants producing 3500 drugs locally."
"Ok, I did not get a chance to listen to the end on friday. Are the final statements done? How did the judge end it. Did he say any timeline of court events in the future. (issue a judgement or ask for further info etc) ?Thanks to the other people on this board that listened in. I had spent some time but could not attend all day."
"The time is ripe for a bombshell announcement, do not expect Kare to preempt the joint announcement,that's the professional way."
without news teva is headed below 9.
the day ended with 300K sold on the last two minuets of trading. that was also the trend of the market.
"As far as I can tell, Louisiana had more than average deaths from opioids, coming out # 22 in death rate. So this is a very good looking settlement, to my eyes.I own too much of this to be wrong! LOL"
"On one more piece of good news Teva can go to 11, Just a hunch for today, sideways Friday on low volume."
Short coverrrrrrre 
Break $10.25 and good to go
"For value investors with a high risk tolerance, pharmaceutical stock Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) could be the perfect discounted Buffett stock to buy hand over fist in September.Just how cheap is Teva? Based on Wall Street's consensus estimate, which is derived from Teva's own adjusted earnings guidance, shares of the company can be bought for a multiple of 3.7 times this year's earnings and 3.5 times the consensus forecast for 2022. For context, the benchmark S&P 500 has a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.4 and a 151-year average P/E of 16.Teva is so inexpensive because it's working its way through a number of operating and legal issues. It grossly overpaid to acquire generic-drug maker Allergan, which ballooned its debt levels, has paid fines tied to foreign bribery allegations, and is facing a slew of lawsuits concerning its role in the opioid epidemic. Clearly, Wall Street is concerned about the company's near-term performance.However, some of these concerns may be overblown. Since taking over as CEO, Kare Schultz has worked wonders. Teva's annual operating expenses have been slashed by billions of dollars, and the company's net debt sits at nearly $23 billion after topping $34 billion when he took over in late 2017. At the current trajectory, Teva should have less than $15 billion in net debt by the end of 2023. This will improve its financial flexibility and allow the company to make larger investments in brand-name drug research and generic-drug development.There's also a realistic chance that Schultz orchestrates a settlement to the ongoing opioid legislation in most U.S. states. Teva is trying to avoid a large cash settlement and would prefer to supply select generic drugs free of charge over the coming decade as part of its fine. If Schultz can broker an agreement with the prosecuting states that doesn't involve a large up-front cash fine, Teva's valuation could soar overnight. There's obviously a risk to this not happening, but at less than 4 times this year's earnings, it's a calculated opportunity for value investors."
Miller’s comment on teva is an upgrade for the stock

This morning is your last chance to get in under 10 (JMO)
"Teva's ongoing court cases leave a lot of room for uncertainty regarding the company's ability to generate cashflows in excess of the risks. That is why we should keep in mind that even though the fundamentals are good, a lack of certainty may be putting pressure on the stock price.On the flip side, if the company secures favorable settlements and continues paying off debt, stockholders might be in for a large upside - barring, of course, any future risky litigation.sourcehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-reason-why-teva-nyse-090510239.html"
People knew already yesterday
I have been in this for 4 years my cost average is about 12.45 . I understand Kare’s strategy of minimal optimism as the more he pumps up the sentiment the more the greedy lawyers feel they are entitled to get. But at the end of the day a significant portion of my life savings is in this stock and the lack of movement is making me despondent. :( I even tried calling lol Orange County superior to ask when judge Wilson is giving his verdict
I believe we will get a positive verdict from California in the next couple of weeks. It could mark a major turning point
"things seem to be moving to a resolution, they better do as i am bored stiff!"
"As I have always stated, Teva is in no hurry to engage in a 18y or 20y payment schedule. Even if they go as nicely as in the Louisiana final settlement. . Other states will follow in a similar fashion.This was all a political-bureocracy issue.. Imao"
I predict based on these legal battles that we will see teva at around $13 by year end. They can’t keep the lid on this company much longer. Their settlement will be positive for a long term recovery in my opinion. Their business model is positive and strong for the future.
i like those 100 k blocks guess whos buying them
No Volume........
Don't be Saully mistaken. This stock is not going lower.
Can we stay above 10 for a Foundation... Then Rocket to 20.... WSB....

"The CA trial resumed today. In order to address the issue of public nuisance (CA trial), the Judge needs to see EVIDENCES, particularly the appropriate prescription vs. inappropriate prescription numbers and the documents that can point to the defendants’ faulty promotional/marketing attempts. Well, the plaintiff representing the People was NOT able to provide to any evidences or documents at all. Instead of providing EVIDENCES that can assist the Judge, the plaintiff cited Conagra case (in lead paint litigation) and other legal theories to advance the plaintiff public nuisance perspective. The Judge politely praised the plaintiff for doing a nice job of presenting the legal theories, but he also told the plaintiff that this is not a legal question, but it is evidentiary question. Since the plaintiff was not able to provide evidences or documents, I think it would be best for the State of CA to settle this case, and I would think the defendants don’t want to settle, but if they do, the settlement would be on their terms."
"The $.15 to $.25 differential in the opening price of TEVA and the low caused by the differentials offers a perfect day trade opportunity. I bought 20k shares this am at $9.48, sold 10k at $9.58 and put a trailing stop on the other 10k. I currently have 112k including the 10k that I still have from. this am trade."

The outcome of both appeals is imminent."
Tomorrow is huge. Traders will have had time to digest the LA settlement and see if it is possibly a precedent for other states. We need follow-thru one volume and price!
Yesterday was a bigger volume Just tradingWhen big news will come u will see the volume
TEVA mentioned on Fox Business this PM giving it some national exposure. Analyst said it would be a buy above $10.45 and that makes sense based on the chart.
Any thoughts about TEVA reinstating dividend?

"A funny gift for our fellow traveler, Michael (aka ""why does Kåre not hold a daily press conference?"") : Suffolk County Legislator Arrested in Pills for Sex StingSuffolk County Legislator William “Doc” Spencer (D-Centerport) was arrested on October, 2020 for attempting to trade oxycodone for sex.Spencer, 53:- has been a legislator since 2012 and serves on the county’s opioid task force.-is married and has three children.-is an ordained minister, Spencer serves as the Pastor of Willow Manor Fellowship in Centerport.-was the chief of otolaryngology at Huntington Hospital. -is also Associate Clinical Professor at Stony Brook University Hospital. -runs a private practice, Long Island Otolaryngology & Pediatric Airway in Huntington.Spencer, was in a Suffolk County vehicle at the time of the arrest, allegedly planned to meet a prostitute in the parking lot of a Goodwill store in Elwood to trade sex for the pills, which were reportedly oxycodone, a legal form of an opioid. Authorities had arranged a sting operation.Spencer, who had two oxycodone pills in his possession at the sting operation, is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony, and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class B felony.Prior to his arrest, Spencer had been involved in several legislative efforts, including to combat the effects of the opioid epidemic. Spencer proposed a resolution that passed unanimously to make Narcan, which reverses the effects of narcotics, available to policy emergency responders in the Second Precinct.Spencer had sponsored 35 resolutions, with close to 1/3 of them related to health and safety, including prohibiting smoking at county beaches and county parks. Spencer’s bills include a 5-cent fee for single use plastic bags, which stores started charging in January, 2018.During his time in office, Spencer had worked to ban the sale of powdered caffeine to minors, raise the age of selling tobacco products, helped pass a measure to stop companies from manufacturing energy drinks to youth and led a ban on flavored e-cigarettes."
After a settlement this will trade around $25 it could be this week this month next month no one knows the exact time but it will be this year .
"So, the high volume on Wednesday and Thursday were a kind of inside information."
"Watching Kare's legal strategy play out, I've added 25,000 more this week.It's literally a no brainer that this stock trades mid-20s in the next twelve months."
Expect another announcement of a settlement this week $12 by Friday
Is this the day we break above $10 on volume and hopefully hold and onward upward for the rest of the year?  
"Bank Hapoalim, the largest Bank in Israel, gives TEVA a price target of 16$. Yaron Friedman, director of the stock desk at Bank Hapoalim's research unit, wrote in response that ""last night the optimism to end the saga increased."" Friedman mentions that the most obscure issue about Teva in recent years is its involvement in the U.S. opioid painkiller sales case - drugs that led to a deadly addiction epidemic of hundreds of thousands of Americans, and which Teva ""received as a dowry"" in acquiring Actavis. "" In the context of the quarterly conference call, it was possible to understand that there is a high probability of a compromise as early as 2021. "" According to Friedman, ""If the current arrangement is indeed a first swallow towards further arrangements, as we estimate, this is likely to remove a very heavy weight over the company's stock already in the medium term, as evidenced by the sharp positive reaction in the company's stock last night. ""With all the plaintiffs, and what will be the total cost of such an arrangement, but as such arrangements are signed, the high risk that characterizes Teva and its share will gradually decrease.""

Wow. Why the drop?
Watch all the positive analyst comments and upgrades come in now post this settlement
Still ways undervalued
"Ted Cruz, loves his Teva sandals."
Will be over 20 next year
my only green stock today
"This settlement only costs Teva $18 million. It is much cheaper than expected. So if all the other States settlements are similar then it will be in the range of $1billion or less and payable in 18 years? They mention NY and CA, so those two are the biggest states and the bellweather. If either one of those states settled the rest will follow. Keep our fingers crossed. Hold long."
Bought some more. There is not much left in the market at such prices
After listening yesterday I changed my mind... I don’t think teva settles in CA.. unless I’m missing something the prosecution had zero evidence to support case. I feel yesterday was bigger then LA settlement but big money did not see it that way.
"The main thing about this agreement is that it signals the future of Teva . The exact numbers in the settlement will become less important than the ability to work on future growth , make plans and execute them. start to grow income and develop. Actually , i see it as they were playing defensive only for the last 4 years , now in 2022 there will be again a possibility to try offence and score a new success ."
Solid move higher on heavy volume. I like it. Maybe they are making progress on a settlement both sides can live with. Good luck!
huh... that temporary plant closing doesn't look like it's affecting the price at all. >>> good.
SP is pushed down on low volumeProfessional work
An agreement in this style with 2-3 more states and the market will most likely be very aggressive with this stock
"I expect TEVA to resolve price-fixing claims very soon. Why? Teva reached a $925K settlement with Mississippi in price-fixing case already in June. From that day TEVA worked to ""replicate these results"" through ongoing settlement discussions with other states. The Mississippi settlement proved TEVA did nothing wrong and with the lack of evidence, I don't find any reason for other states not to follow. TEVA dropped from 15$ to 8$ after the price-fixing case was first published. It will bounce back after settlement. All eyes are at the Opioid case but a global settlement in the price-fixing case will be a game-changer for TEVA."
Any particular reason for the move from 9.68 to 9.82 ?
"Kare Shultz interview to YNET:https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-6001647,00.html""The stock's low market cap has a potential to break out and reach a ratio between the share price and earnings per share as it customary in pharmaceutical companies, 3-4 times higher than the current one."""
"Volume of 625k stocks in the last 5 minutes, and finishing on the day's high. Seems like a bullish trend is cooking up"
"Everyone saying high volume, but looks like we may finish just under average? Would love to see a settlement this year."
0n 7:09 423K volume on -1.4% I dont think that in 2021 there was such volume at this time
None trivial green volume for 14:2330k on 1.53% up
"Not sure if any of you look at cafe pharma. But it appears teva has done some restructuring on the neurology and respiratory sales forces. I’m not sure how many cuts were made, but neurology is somewhat surprising as those reps sell Ajovy and Austedo. I won’t speculate what that could mean about sales of both products, but I do know these two were supposed to help ease the copaxone decline. Something they will talk about on next earnings call hopefully."

Inflation is helping TEVA reduce its debt with inflated dollars.
Good results on copaxone new study showed no effects on breastfeeding babies
Decent Volume change in the last half hour... Last time it did that we had Louisiana settlement next day. Glad to see it not give back Louisiana gains from last week. 22 days til earnings .... We traded so bad prior to last earnings.... this is starting to feel different.
smelling settlement
Just crossed the 200 day at 10.04 with no news 12 to 13 before earning with a settlement double
"Given the California judge says there’s a “dearth of evidence” supporting the counties’ case, why isn’t there a more positive reaction in the stock? Thoughts?"
"""what document exists where the companies told the doctors to issue more scripts due to ""pseudo addition"" ?? (false addiction.)"
Can't you just feel settlement news any moment in your bones?
TEVA is about to run every day now
stock acting like something big coming
$12 to $13 before earning after earning $15
I am thinking that TEVA's strategy is brilliant as the CA and NY results will certainly pave the way for a national settlement if TEVA's strategy is correct. CA judge has already questioned the plaintiff's evidence and the NY trial has a jury that can look through the plaintiff BS. So let's see how TEVA fares against ABBV.
Today’s action means nothing….RSI was 32 yesterday and market up hugeJust traders
"Let break $10 and go to $12 this Friday. No question, TEVA you can do it. I'm loading up 1000 shares more today."
"Hope this holds. My God, we need some good news. Thank you Teva."
"0.6M volume post trading, have not seen that in a long time."
Low volume (relating to previous two weeks).market sentiment depresses the buy action but there is not much selling too.
"Like I said last week, all the momentum indicators are flashing Green, gotta buy now. On the rise"
"I filled my position in TEVA a couple weeks ago and normally have a rule to not add to a filled position unless I’m down 10%. I just couldn’t help myself today. Didn’t exactly nail the bottom, but loaded again at $9.79. It’s just too darn cheap under $10 to let it go. I have decided to resume buying on a daily basis if TEVA continues another SP decline. This is a Once in a lifetime opportunity to aquire dirt cheap shares in a company that is destined to, (at the very least), double our $ in the coming months. I have nothing but time, and suggest that everyone load up at current levels. My entire investing network of friends and family all own shares of TEVA. I think sub $10 SP time is running out. Grab as much as ya can."
Soon we be over 50 again 
"Same as the day beforeOn hold, but volume up a little."
Did you load Michael at 9 ?
hmmmm Cali news soon? this is what happened with Louisiana
This is undervalued!
New York or California settlement would take us to 12... All state settlement to follow would take us to $16.. Continued debt pay down slowly to 25. One of the big states need to fall first. Debt will drive ship and not give us the immediate $20 a lot are calling for. Kare is managing the debt.. .The settlements are needed to boost bond ratings and allow them to push out the debt that is maturing in the next couple of years. All seem possible.
Nice to see it holding up so well.. Think FOMO is here finally... I believe TEVA will push it only so far in CA and NY but not let a judge decide it.. The real fight is with Allergan and who is paying what... That is where the fight is..
Anyone one see an update on the NY trial? Is it near closing arguments?
Very painful to hold this stock over period of 1-3 years. Testing everyone patience levels...
Signing Sarah Michelle Gellar to promote drug initiative should have been worth at least a buck a share
"10/11/2021 - Opposition Of Teva To Plaintiff’s Motion By Order To Show Cause in NY(excerpt)On October 1, the State of NY filed a meritless Motion by Order to Show Cause (“OTSC”) alleging that Defendants failed to comply with certain discovery obligations by allegedly (1) not disclosing discoverable documents relating to certain DEA” inspections, (2) not producing certain documents in the custody of their parent company, and (3) not disclosing information produced in ongoing litigation in the Court for the Northern District of California. With all due respect to the State, it should have more carefully and diligently reviewed the discovery record before lobbing the shrill and unfounded accusations it made in the OTSC. And, after having done so, it could have and should have addressed and resolved any remaining questions it had through a professional meet-and-confer process. But such collaboration never seems to be of interest to the State, which consistently seems to prefer casting dramatic aspersions to engaging in professional dialogue. In short, had the State met even the most basic requirements of conferring with counsel, this unnecessary imposition on the Court’s time and resources would have been avoided. Further, the State is not entitled to take another belated bite at the apple by trying to bring Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Israel) into this case. (by alleging that some doctors were paid by Teva, Ltd. ""Israel"")Once either the Court or Justice Maltese has the opportunity to cut through the State’s unnecessary hyperbole and assess the actual facts, these issues will lend themselves to prompt resolution. This case does not need another sideshow intended by the State to divert attention from the material facts at issue.Defendants fully satisfied their discovery obligations by producing the documents to which the parties agreed. If the State did not like its agreement and wanted to renegotiate the scope of discovery, it should have – and could have – endeavored to do so long before discovery closed in New York. The State cannot – at this late hour – now endeavor to alter the terms of its unambiguous prior agreement based on some notion of “buyer’s remorse.” That is especially true given that the State has been well-aware since long before this trial began that Defendants made sometimes voluminous productions in other opioid cases around the country. Accordingly, the State’s complaint about a lack of notice of discovery in other opioid cases rings false.This litigation continued under the parties’ Discovery Agreement for more than two years. Now, 15 months after the close of discovery and over four months into trial, the State claims that it is entitled not only to more than what it agreed to accept, but also to specific notice and disclosure of all documents produced in every one of the multitude of opioid cases throughout the United States. Defendants honored their discovery obligations and agreements in this case. The State needs to do so as well.In the end, the only record that the State points to that it claims should have been produced under the Discovery Agreement is a single 2005 email.The State’s allegation is frivolous and, if not an oversight based on a failure to search the discovery record, appears to have been deliberately manufactured in an attempt to create an issue where none exists.The State not only waived its right to discovery from other litigations when it made the Discovery Agreement with Defendants, but also waived any argument to the contrary long before filing its OTSC. The State did so by sitting on its hands for years fully aware, and taking full advantage, of the discovery about which it now feigns ignorance."
