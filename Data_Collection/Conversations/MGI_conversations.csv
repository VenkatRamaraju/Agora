just price correction! all log investors will be happy!
"With the dramatic shifts in the global economy, digital payment services are playing an increasingly critical role for people worldwide. Today’s crisis highlights the need for the digitization of cash, access, speed and reliability—especially for those sending money home to loved ones. Across the globe, digitalization has increased rapidly: as much as 80% in Italy, for example. Global digital payment growth is accelerating too, with e-transactions increasing over 40% and digital remittances spiking for several payment providers, including Western Union and MoneyGram International.Digitization of global payments can’t come soon enough. The underlying infrastructure is siloed and complex, leading to significant delays and high transaction fees. To speed up this process, financial institutions pre-fund accounts in destination currencies—but this is a costly endeavor that ties up assets and exposes companies to currency risk.........................."

This will continue to expand the network & improve top line. Debt refi & positive cash flow will reflect in 3rd & 4th ER. It’d be even nice to give one time divy early next year with some of those cash.
"History lesson for you all – Way back when the dinosaurs roamed (1995) First Data Corporation who at that time owned MoneyGram acquired First Financial Management which was the shell company that owned Western Union. One condition that the Federal Trade Commission required for the acquisition to take place was that First Data needed to spin off MoneyGram as its own company for anti-monopolistic reasons. Western Union combined with MoneyGram was deemed too much a monopoly for the Government to allow. MGI as a stand-alone company was born. Since the announcement or leak (whichever it was) of the news that WU was looking at MGI was a few months ago now, makes you wonder if they are having difficulties pushing the acquisition of MoneyGram by Western Union through the regulators. Although many folks on this board seem to think that MGI can stand on its own, it has a decades long legacy of losing a bunch of money including at least 97% of the stockholders money. My thesis is that if the acquisition is not approved for the same reason Govt would not allow MoneyGram and WU together previously, or as some pundits say is put off due to negligence of current management, the pitifully low stock will be crushed once again. If both the Govt approves and the management sees the light that their is power in unity and that the old-school model companies need to join together, you’ll make some money. Good luck."
Breakout. Its ready !!!
considering the promises of blockchain for cross border payments & payments in general...MoneyGram is kind of obsolete IMO. If migrants in USA figure out they can use crypto to instantly transfer value to Lupita back home...why would they waste time with MGI.
One thing we have learned time and time again ... buy when market is panicking ... buy when everyone is selling ... this is the time to buy ... from q4 this year they will start generating profits/positive eps.... it will at least be 20 by next year ... and if by any chance the wallstreet doesn’t realize it’s potential ... Alex mentioned they will consider other ‘optionalties’ like selling/segment reporting etc ... buy
"I say $325M - $328M on revenue with 0.03 to 0.05 earnings, beating Wall Street on top line and on EPS. More importantly, the forward guidance they give on EPS after cost cutting and debt refi. That will drive the next leg up for the stock."
"Over on stocktwits, several postings regarding Order Flow Distribution...lots of large lot buys on Friday while sellers were smaller orders. That is also consistent with options market, where Sep $12 calls remained at a premium and were actually up on Friday (instead of dropping in a normal sell-off). IMO, this means Friday was a headfake to get buyout rumor traders and smaller retail investors out before the next leg up. It was a great earnings report for a company that has had all the legal expenses of a DPA and interest expenses related to debt dragging down bottom line EPS for years."
"I have been investing on Mgi since it was around $1.40 and have increased my position since then, as their fundamentals and goals solidify. I invest on already established companies with high value low priced stock with a great upside potential. Two other companies on a turn around that are looking very good that have some issues but have a big upside future are GE and Sprint. But my main focus is on MGI due to its immediate upside potential."
Breaking Twelve again! Higher Highs!Hang on!
"Finally, weak hands and short-term profit taking (buyout rumor buyers) looks to be wrapping up. Increased institutional accumulation prior to 4Q earnings. Largest volume of option contracts are for Jan and Feb 2021 $10 Calls, which means top investors putting this in double digits soon."
"This is unusual trading, something is going down"
"Total revenue of $329.3 million, 0.01 earnings (impact of one-time cost cutting/debt refi expenses). No impact of WU being in Walmart stores. Revenue for digital (MGO) increased to $47.0 million and 33% of all transactions. Solid numbers and impressive momentum in digital."
This will get bought out
"There is a lot of understood fear out there beacuse of a possible recession. Mgi is part of Nasdaq. Nasdaq is been around for 48 years, the Dow for over 100, and S&P for arround 90 years. There have been arround 47 recessions in the USA alone, dating back to the Articles Of Confederation. The stock market always rebounded. In times like now, when the markets are down is when history tells us to step in and buy into the market, a time when prizes tend to be cheaper. Everyone has their own goals, some, short term quick profits, some longterm stable big profits. Ones have to believe on what you are investing into. The forum here is great, but do you own research also. MGI is at a support level as it can be seen on charts, it moves a few cents up and down from around $4 current prize, which to take note is the nearing prize target from most professional analyst following on this stock, a level tha we hit a few weeks ago. With all respect no one knows, but I personally dont believe this stock will go down to $2.50 like someone here mentions. Keep in mind what is being happening since last earnings report. We are nearing another ER from this company which we know overall is going to be better than last. I strongly believe the stock is closing in on an upside to 6 and beyond with eventual pull backs that can be gauged by studying the charts for bearish or bullish sentiment. MGI is been arround for a long time and is held perhaps the highest stock prize than any other company of its kind. They are coming back arround and stronger."
They will get bought out most likely it seems
"These dips at market open are a complete joke. Tried to buy Aug $13 Call Options on the dip at open and orders did not get filled. I moved bid up a couple of times, but no fills. Finally just cancelled order."
All the companies are dipping even after good earnings ... all be prepared for MGI dip this Friday even with better earnings ... it will be temporary though ... I am looking forward for earnings and future story rather than short term stock price ...
"10 trading days until earnings. They already gave us multiple hints that this is going to be blow out 4Q and that will boost 2020 numbers into solid positive EPS. Then Analysts will jump on board and issue ""buy"" ratings. My model has them at close to $200M cash in the bank by 4Q close, which will help a lot with refinance on the debt, since interest rates at all time lows. I've said it going back 6 months and I'll repeat for newbies...MGI and WU will be at the same share price in 2021. This is a successful company transformation well underway, regardless of M&A activity."
"This stock is locked and loaded ! It takes very little buy pressure to go up ! The cup with handle is a beautiful chart. IF this get to 13 or so, look out !"
"Here come Western Union and their war chest!Western Union Chief Financial Officer Raj Agarwal told Karen Webster that it’s the right move for the business right now. Goldfinch and Baupost are good buyers for the business, he noted, and the sale will add nearly a billion dollars to WU’s sizeable war chest to invest in and focus on “the things that we're really good at,” which is enabling money in minutes between senders and receivers anywhere in the world."
"I finished crunching all the numbers from the Q2 report and I'm disappointed that MGI didn't focus more on the high expenses (historical recurring and one-time) in Q2 and emphasize the expense reductions / savings going forward. For example, It appears that MGI paid at least $32.8M in Q2 for interest and early extinguish fees on debt deals. When I plug in their lower interest payments going forward with the Revenue/EBITDA projections given, it appears to give them $20M+ free cash flow quarterly going forward. I've found that FCF is an outstanding leading indicator for stock price when a company is executing a turnaround. I also get $14 a share based on same multiple as WU (legacy remittance) with the lower expenses and higher FCF."
Stock is a #$%$ if and when we get a rally I dump
"Simple wall street article on MGI: Relative to the current share price of US$9.1, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently."
so boring without news
"That was fast: In less than two weeks, MoneyGram completed the ATM Program by selling $99.8 million, or 10.4 million Shares, at an average price per share of $9.56, resulting in total net proceeds to the Company of $97.6 million. As of June 17, 2021, MoneyGram had 90,530,779 shares outstanding, which includes the shares that were sold pursuant to the ATM"
"Global money transfer transactions increased 2% year-over-year, with international transaction growth accelerating to 9%"
"This Walmart move seems a lot like when Facebook announced Libra crypto...regulators jumped in pretty quick. Even if it does move forward, seems years away since they haven't built anything...my guess would be late 2022 if they have build the platform/app.Key language in the PR...""Walmart did not share the name of the new company or say when its services will be available.""""Walmart said it may acquire or partner with other fintech companies.""What fintech is more undervalued than MGI? Potential partnership or acquistion makes sense, since Walmart renewed the money services deal with MGI."
Stella ..non profit currency exchange its pushing the tranfer envelope..very original to curb inflation and have little guy have options..so whats its gameplan with mgi...enigma concept but they got global backing.sounds risky count me in...looking up and forward steward ship world play...seems to be nonprofit goal with mi in mix...GO FUGURE..
"Amended 13D on Moneygram Investor Site, looks like 11 days of selling by Ripple, 3.5M shares, and they drove the average daily sales price down from $7.47 at the start to $5.74 at finish. The way I read it they are done. ""As a result of the transactions described in Item 5 of this Amendment, the Plan terminated pursuant to its terms upon the Financial Institution’s sale of the Maximum Amount.""Should be good week and remainder of month. Hopefully, we'll get some idea of why Ripple unloaded all of this within few weeks, since they could've spread out the sales through Spring."
the daily chart tells the entire story.. the stochastic is embedded… on 80. a magical number. todays candle is larger and higher than the last 8 days . and the volume is exceeding the previous days. unless something bad happens tomorrow should be near 4.00. You can’t buy a better chart. Amazing position to be in
market sell off....we need to be strong next 1-2 month!!!
"I'm a numbers guy and when I look at institutional buying vs retail selling on this dip, I see MGI coming out of this with only 20M shares available in the freely traded float. To me, that sets up a coiled spring effect and when positive news hits and we hit volume of 8m - 10M shares traded on a big news day, this stock will fly. There are several potential news items from now through May that could trigger this kind of climb;1. SEC and Ripple settle / courts toss out class actions suits.2. DPA final payment to DoJ gets reduced or waived completely.3. Debt gets refinanced with CDX help, reducing interest expenses which are impacting bottom line.4. Multiple FinTechs/VC's come forward with M&A interest...this possibility increased significantly with triple digit app growth and return to profitability. The cash that MGI has added (near $200M) directly reduces the purchase price (Share Price + Premium + Debt)."
Let's hope for more clear sailing up until earnings release and BTW it would be nice if ER date were announced with no further surprises. I think that would help stabilising the stock
"A decent merchant acquires paying little mind to advertise variances, I began putting utilizing mr Brian platform in June of a year ago, he shared his business strategies and assisted me with accomplishing my objectives and now the benefit rate is outstanding. TeIegram> @Brianfxtrade"
"My take from the earnings call- Positive EPS in Q4 (not in Q3 as I had expected)- Walmart competition will cost MGI quite a lot in profit (my guess 5-8 mill USD). I can figure out what 250 bp means and it's not very clear, but at least we got the number on MGI Walmart business- The 400 million loan that we hadn't heard about when it comes to interest rate, is a floating interest loan (they didn't mention how much), and they can repay along the way. But if interest rates go up so will their expenses- There's a lot of growth and confidence in the callI think the stock price was pushed up ""artificially"" by MM exploiting retail investors once again. We saw exactly the same thing happen last quarter. We're easy prey ..."
"You guys know what it means when a stock is quiet and low volume, right?It means that some form of big news..good or bad is coming up.Hopefully it’s an offer to buy the company."
"I find these stories buried but MGI continues these deals and seems to do nothing for the stock.IME Digital's users to access MoneyGram's technologyGlobal payment heavyweight MoneyGram, the world's leader in P2P payments and remittances, has partnered with IME Digital to let its customers access MoneyGram's platform for digital payments via the IME Pay mobile app.Thanks to this collaboration, IME's customers in Nepal will be able to send and receive funds using their mobile wallets.MoneyGram expects that, after this cooperation gets going, millions of IME clients in Nepal will be able to make their lives easier by accessing the technology via RippleNet.At the moment, the remittance flow in Nepal is evaluated at $8 bln. Aside from that, this country is one of the crucial markets for the remittance giant in South Asia"
"Trying to shake loose some cheap shares before blowout 4Q and 2020 earnings report. The options market is still betting on share price increases, the puts are barely moving on this news. Still 500% more calls for Feb than puts. Don't sell shares cheap based on a Walmart move several years away!"
MoneyGram is paying down debt and the use of XRP cuts cost and adds speed and accuracy in exchange rates. Even if no buyout MoneyGram will heal on it's own. Expanding into the Philippines will add value.
"As expected, back above $9. This is a crucial level. Hopefully we can hear some positive guidance from Q3 as we head towards the end of the year."
"""Following a record-breaking July, we continued to see remarkable momentum in our digital business in August as we reported triple-digit year-over-year cross-border transaction growth for our direct-to-consumer digital business for the eighth consecutive month,"""
Totally misread this one I guess everyone caught on to the digital Bitcoin fast transfer realize there's a lot of money in it they got existing areas of Interest so it's going to be tougher everyone's getting the same type of app and Bloomberg is is wrong and no more news so what do you do you buy it if it gets lower
"For people on the fences about investing in MGI, the competitor Western Union is currently valued at 11.34B. Let that sink in for a moment, the second largest in the money transfer space is MGI valued at 143.1M. The mobile money market is expected to grow to 112.29B by 2021. MGI is extremely undervalued. My 2 cents"
"You can trade this but as an investment it's basically a bet against crypto at this point, good luck with that."
Congrats to all longs..never too late to buy or add more... better days are coming... this stock shouldn’t be trading below $30.. smart investors are accumulating now as they know the real value of MGI.. I wouldn’t sell a single stock below $30 and maybe I will increase my target price in the future depends on the business performance

"Guys I have a question, I got in at $3.43 and my sell target is between $15-$20.00. This is not my ""get rich"" stock, Im relying on my crypto holdings for that which includes XRP. My question is, how high do you see MGI going? Should I not be a seller around $20.00? Now that they are using XRP and forming a Visa partnership could we see higher or even a higher buyout (if MGI is still for saleI)? What is your strategy? You guys are awesome! Thank you!"
did anyone post.. a couple days ago there was an analyst upgrade with a $7 price target
Told you it would happen a long time ago! Stellar is the Best!
"I need some feedback from some of you. I bought a thousand shares a couple of days ago for the long haul.Here's why: I bought Moneygram to get exposure to Ripple and that new Ripple money transfer platform that a lot of banks seem to be adopting. I had been trying to figure out a way to invest in this new Ripple platform and, low and behold, this Ripple/Moneygram thing popped up on my radar. So I didn't exactly buy Moneygram for Moneygram, I bought it to get exposure to Ripple.Question: Am I the only one thinking this way, that this is an investment in Ripple money transfer platform technology ?Thanks for any feedback."
I sent a comment yesterday to not panic with the correction today because it is due and I was called a newbie.I own 100k shares of mgi since 2.10 and and been trading for 20 years. I’m in for the long haul.Relax and stop checking the price every minute
Pretty strange price action near the end of the session today. Not sure if that is good or bad. After a hard dip it seemed to recover fairly well. Next week might be very interesting. If the weak hands got flushed out we may move higher now. Time will tell.
$5 stock
$15-20 stock here based on growth. Earnings comes out to match and we could see $50 here. Market cap is the key!! U can’t look at stock price. If the stock is $50 they have a market cap of 3.6billion which is reasonable with 1.4-1.5billion in sales and profit of 50-100million
Stopped everybody out. Buyout Monday IMO.
"Seems that WU came in with a lowball offer and when that didn't work, they may have indicated they could take control. It's likely they have accumulated shares with folks handing them cheap shares, but still below the SEC filing levels (which would trigger a huge run up in share price). MGI probably knows the digital platform growth will lead to much higher stock price than the low offer. Great earnings report will force WU to up their bid...it may also bring other big industry players into a bidding war. If the digital platform is growing 100% YoY, then the stock will likely ignite without a buyer."
I love setting new lows on great news. Buy baby buy
$25 here we Come!Hasn’t even been priced in yet?Wall Street now running around! 
"Debt has been restructured. Cleaning up the books is the first step of the buyout. Buyer will look to unlock the value, take what they want and spin off the rest..as a stand alone Fintech over Crypto transactions."
"There are 300% more August Calls ($12 and up) than August Puts ($11 and below). Last time we had that kind of imbalance we were around $5.75 - 6.50 range and the Calls were predicting $7, $8, $9 move."
"Ripple can start converting their warrants as long as the price stays above $6.40.

But to me it's pretty obvious.As defined in the SPA, “Termination Event” means the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the Commercial Agreement (as defined below) is terminated by the Company or Ripple due to a material breach by the other party, (ii) the Company files for liquidation or bankruptcy or is declared insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction, (iii) an event of default occurs under the Company’s first or second lien credit facilities (or any successor facility) that is not cured or waived within 45 days, (iv) the Company experiences a material adverse regulatory action that prevents or impairs the Company from providing money transfer services in key corridors and is not resolved for a period exceeding 45 days or (v) the Company undergoes a change of control."
Pre/market looks promising
My guess for Q3:- More impact from Walmart competition than expected- Lower revenue than expected due to people in US not being vaccinated- Maybe a new round of layoffsPrice target: 6.7 which will hopefully be the bottom this time around
"MoneyGram has announced that is partnering with the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit organization, to enable cash funding and payout in local currency for consumers using U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC), along with almost instantaneous back-end settlements, according to a press release.The partnership will let customers convert USDC to cash or vice versa, which will boost utility and liquidity of digital assets, the release stated. It will also allow more consumers to access the digital economy.“At MoneyGram, one of our top strategic priorities is to pioneer cross-border payment innovation and blockchain-enabled settlement, and we’re thrilled to now work with the Stellar Development Foundation to further our efforts,” said MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes in the release. “As crypto and digital currencies rise in prominence, we’re especially optimistic about the potential of stablecoins as a method to streamline cross-border payments. Given our expertise in global payments, blockchain and compliance, we are extremely well-positioned to continue to be the leader in building bridges to connect digital currencies with local fiat currencies.”Settlements with MoneyGram will now happen in near-instant with USDC, which will improve the collection of funds, boost efficiency and decrease risk, according to the release.Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director Denelle Dixon said in the release that the partnership shows “how blockchain technology and stablecoins bring new opportunities to global customers and enhance the existing financial system.”She said a new swathe of cash users will now “be able to convert their cash into and out of USDC,” which will help them get faster, more nimble digital asset services, per the release.MoneyGram has been a target of takeover interests as it has moved further away from legacy services. In July, Stellar and private equity firm Advent International were mulling the acquisition of MoneyGram."
$51M added to bottom line from DPA exit and debt refi actions. That's more than $0.50 per share annually going forward.
"I think we're stuck in this range until MGI shows some EPS gains, hopefully in Q3, definitely in Q4"
Bleeding like it's been stabbed.
"What I like about MGI is the insider transactions. I see a lot of management purchasing shares. None of them are selling. If i'm a manager in a company that is in the process of making a comeback and that company is producing, of course i'm going to buy shares in it. On the other hand, if I see that the company is going to fail, I'm going to sell every share that I own. MGI management has been buying!"
"cash machineBesides transferring money from party to party around the globe, MoneyGram itself is a cash-printing business. The company, worth a hair more than $1 billion on the market, did nearly $300 million in adjusted EBITDA last year and nearly $180 million in levered free cash flow. Its debt load is manageable and demand, in the near term, should keep things healthy for the business and its stock.MoneyGram management reportedly wanted a buyout price in the mid-$20s per share -- at least a 25% premium to its"
Could we get a bidding war with several interested parties jumping in? They're getting $1.3B revenue / $272M Digital Revenue / $220M EBITDA trading at $900M market cap which is ridiculous in fintech. HUMBL is near same market cap and has $198K in revenue.
1st step then full merger. Making sense now?
I travel frequently. Currently in San Ingancio Belize. MGI is everywhere and all the locals use to transfer money and according to local contact they have a banking feature. They are in almost every city I visit. I think they have a bright future.
climbing fast big profits in the next earnings reportanalyst should report this as a strong buy soon
This is a minimum $16 stock all day long. No problem being patient during all the noise...
They missed but...remember bleaker times...its in headlights for not hitting est..so what do they know ...came in lower then projections did no loose money and debt cleard up and maybe sale sign.up .might raise price...talley ho
Been buying every time under $9Tia!Fiona
"Sentiment doesn't seem great these days. In the long timeframe maybe another buyout rumor will pump this again. For now, I am not sure what moves this up."
Twitter and Strike can now process money transfers anywhere in the world for free. Put a fork in it done! Crypto eats another one
very good press release even if it goes down since there's some profit-taking early I'm staying the course with the possibility of a merger or buyout and the did you do a platform that they use it's it's transfer friendly hold until relieved and if it goes lower I'll nibble again I'm up beat it could have been some big losses tally ho
This is a nothing Burger
Sold some MGI just before the newest takeover rumor at $10.18. Now the price is below that number. Is this not considered a bona fide offer???
"New Position - Capital World Investors - As of the 13F-HR filing on 11-14-19 Capital World Investors has taken a new position of over 2.6 million shares. Anyone knee deep in the investment community knows that Capital Group is the big dog on the block holding dozens of other funds like Wash Mutual, ICA, IFA among dozens of others. They have the long term rep of being the cadillac of investment advisors who think extremely long term. Huge development."
"We all know that Central Banks will be issuing their own coins, so just need the blockchain platform (Stellar, Ripple, Ethereum, Cardano, any will work) to transfer digital funds and make the foreign exchange and settlement. MGI getting out ahead of the regulation and not trying to pick a specific coin because many could be declared securities. Ripple could be tied up in the SEC lawsuit for years and then it's too late, winners in this race will be decided in coming 12-18 months."
"How can this be at $800m market cap only? It amazes me, I’ll hold but this should be trading at least 5 x this."
And why are we down today?
"oof, this isn't good i don't care how you spin it, shoulda bounced after this fall not fell off a cliff"
"MGI just gave everyone a huge clue that 4Q earnings are going to be stellar. I have been analyzing their 2Q and 3Q results to try and model digital growth impact on revenue over the next few quarters. When I put in those kind of growth numbers, I easily get double digit share price after 4Q earnings are announced. I also get cash on hand of over $200M, so servicing the debt is not an issue. As long as earnings stay on this upward trajectory, I get WU and MGI at same share price in 2021."
Sold my final stake today (9-29-2021) at $8.215. Will closely monitor with an eye to jumping back in.
"Institutions will buy every single share sold on this dip. This is best FinTech investment by far (30X on 2020 Pandemic revenues), I mean competitors are trading at 50X - 200X+. Also, OTC players without a single customer (just website with future app) are trading at $5B market cap."
Buyout at $18?
"MGI being a very volatile stock, with a a small amount of stock available to the public for trading (30 million float) makes it a prime candidade for manipulation by large institutions with the goal to instill fear and force other traders to sell their positions for someone else to grab at a much cheaper price. Remenber for every seller has to be a buyer and vice versa in the trading world, this is why it is important to hold your position and stay long if you believe in what you are investing. Technically no one loses on a drop unless you sell your position. MGI stock will come back as seen since the beginning of this year. Stocks with a small float tend to be very attractive since they can move up good distance even on small volume, and if volume increases due to some good news we can see spikes of 100% to 400% in minutes, which is something we wont see on companies with a large cap and float. Perfect examples of these kind of companies with a small float that have performed well are beyond meat and Euronet World Wide. I firmly believe MGI is heading that way too."

"If everyone is confused… the fast jump from $9s to $12 was due to buyout talk. CEO says he doesn’t want to sell now so we went back down. It’s going back up but will be more gradual and in line with continued company performance (ie multiple quarters), unless of course a new buyout offer comes along which could happen any day…"
Will explode on upside close to 25$
Can someone with better knowledge give an opinion regarding pre-market activity in MGI. Since last week some days during pre-market price jumps 5% 8% or like today up to 10%. However opening flat and not much action during the day
Who thinks XRP will partner with MGI after the SEC suit settles?
CEO of MGI now on CNN. Revenue jumped by 20%. Refused to comment on Stellar rumor but said he is not surprised due to amazing growth of company.
He didn’t say he wouldn’t sell. He said he and the board have no motivation to sell right now and want to put their strategy forward which they are “just getting started.” He made that point very clear in the face of the Stellar rumor.He also said he would sel for the right price (i.e. likely much more than what Stellar and Advent are talking about).That would be great for us assuming someone comes along willing to throw that money at them but no such talk yet.Personally I believe if anyone’s coming along with $5 billion it’s SBI Japan.
Strong fundamentals. Looking forward to end October results
"Looking at loans again. So if they sell for 100 million US$ stock in the coming months. They should be able to save 13 million per year in interest if everything else stay equal. If they are able to get rid of that 13% second lien loan and replace the remaining with f.ex. 6% as the first lien is the savings will be:- 100 million payed off = 13 million- 150 million saving 7% per year = 10.5 millionTotal savings 23.5 million or 5+ million per quarter. This is actually less than they got from Ripple showing how profitable that arrangement was for MoneyGram. This will translate into 5 cents per (diluted) share per quarter.""As announced today, Bank of America, N.A. has arranged a second amended and restated first lien credit agreement including a $35 million senior secured three-year revolving credit facility that may be used for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate principal amount of $35 million, which matures September 30, 2022, and a senior secured four-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $645 million. Additionally, a second lien credit agreement provides for a secured five-year term loan facility of $245 million.The interest rate for the revolving credit facility will be LIBOR plus either 6.00% or 5.75% per annum depending on the Company's First Lien Leverage Ratio, and the interest rate for the first lien term loan facility will be LIBOR plus 6.00%. All term loans under the second lien term loan facility bear interest at a rate of 13.00% per annum."""

Here is my analysis on earnings ... q3 quarter the eps was expected to be .06 and they surpassed it by by 176 percent .... q4 quarter the eps is expected .07 and they will still beat it by 175 percent because December was its highest transaction ever month ... before that it was July ... when the earnings was announced institutions started loading shares on 30 the October until ripple dumped ... I suspect this earnings more institutions will pile on starting 19th all the way till March because of consecutive positive net income and beating eps by stupendous margin ... 20 dollars by March I am suspecting ... very realistic ... pile on now trust me it’s not late at all ...

Hold strong to your shares. Ignore the bears posing as bulls. It will recover. Stocks goes and down as you know. Just be patient.
"Paraphrase Alex on Q&A - ""We can unlock value through being sold, going private, or a spin-off...we're not against any move that unlocks the value of this company"". ""I have a responsibility to consider any offer that is real and at the right valuation""."
SQ just bought an Australian company for 29 billion
Looks like the rug was finally pulled :(
Let’s see how the market reacts to the edited earnings transcript. It’s all positive.
"If anyone follows Fintel, you should see that they also confirm that GS conversion is completed. The site shows a 77.8 mil shares out standing today. Compared to the 60 sth million yesterday. Where will this go from here? 1. If GS conversion is to prepare for the hostile takeover / BO, we should see it shortly (weeks) 2. Let's say the worst case is GS conversion is to dump their shares (which I doubt as selling preferred is much less of a hassle); it's also a great news for MGI. Why? They will save on a huge interest payment for GS (if my memory is correct, it's around $11 million a year)Again, very very unlikely that GS dumped the share, but it's still good news regardlesshttps://fintel.io/so/us/mgi"
"let's talk a few facts for the newbies here:1. MGI share price at $3.3 is less than 50% of its 52-week high 2. 110% grow of digital channel in May proves that it will strive and will win in this pandemic3. Its today market cap is less than 50% of Hertz, a bankrupted company4. Significant buying of insiders, outside big investors like Ripple, Brink, etc. 5. Partnership in over 70 markets, Uber, CVS, Walmart and a market leader in key remittance markets like Philippines, India, etc. 6. Strong interests from multiple buyers in the past. The Chinese offered a buyout at $17. Euronet offered at $20. All were received in the past 3 years8. The rumor of a Western Union buyout is from Bloomberg. Their M&A accuracy is 80%. 9. With entries of so many fintech, not doing anything will lead Western Union to lose for the next 20-30 years and eventually become the Best Buy of money transfer. I'm not saying that the buyout is tomorrow. But it can be any days now. That's how the news got leaked. Because it reached a certain stage when 1 party has to pressure"
"One insider selling is not concerning. If we start seeing a trend then yea, i'd be concerned."
"As a result, we're one of the biggest, fastest-growing Fintechs in the world. * Largest component of our digital business, MoneyGram Online, or MGO, our direct-to-consumer digital channel delivered 143% year-over-year cross-border transaction growth in the fourth quarter* We delivered an impressive 215% year-over-year increase in transactions through our leading app in 2020.* In 2020, we saw 122% increase in the monthly average number of customers using either our app or our website. * This growth rate is over triple the growth rate from 2019.* In December, we were either the first or second company in app downloads in most of the largest digital send market. * We are now in a digital annual revenue run rate of $200 million with incredible growth rate."
"MGI's Technology is a Winner. Here's why...1. MoneyGram reported 100% year-over-year digital transaction growth last month.2. 80% of online transactions was effected via smartphones, reflecting the popularity of handheld devices to make money transfers.3. Q1 2020, digital transactions surged 57%.4. Digital growth skyrocketed 107%, 92% and 156% year-over-year growth from MoneyGram Online, Digital Partnerships and Account Deposit and mobile wallet.The reason they didn't take off sooner is that they were working through changes from physical locations to a digital online experience. It takes a few quarters to work through the old way to the new way.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moneygram-mgi-gains-traction-may-171905835.html"
"Just bought more at 7,99"
"we are crushing any new fintech in terms of revenues and soon in EPS, and growing fast. Alex frustrated with sell side analysts for not recognizing the progress that company has made so far and given facts that those same analysts give competitors much higher multiples despite their growth slowing and moneygram's accelerating, think they miss the fact that prey becomes a predator and can not only fight back but to take their projected digital share.for a comparison, $MGI trades at 4.5 multiple to EBIDTA, has $815M debt$WU trades at 7. multiple to EBIDTA, has $4B in debt.$WISE trades at x23 multiple to revenue, 0 debt?$remitly has $5B valuation (could not find their metrics)Global money transfer market is $600B estimated, plenty of room for MGI to grow their digital business as 60-70% of that market is still legacy walk in."
slow bleed down; back to 5 dollars?
Volume really low today... Probably a short term bottom here
"The Zacks story today clearly demonstrates why there is an early mover opportunity here...even after stating there are strong positive estimate revisions, Zacks rates a HOLD. Once 4Q turns 2020 positive with annual report and 10K, then analyst will be allowed by their firms to issue BUY recommendations...they are stuck because of trailing negative earnings from last full annual report.Quote from Zacks article...The company has seen three positive estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved higher over the past few weeks, suggesting that more solid trading could be ahead for MoneyGram. MoneyGram currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is 0.00%."
This is huge!!! Less go longs
Well bloomberg got steller right..wont soar up till the experts figure out the path and union fevelops .imho its a shot in thevarm
Rumour it will be takeover soon .don’t miss the boat
"As Moneygram is now a partner of Facebook to send and receive money using WhatsApp Pay expect this stock to explode with or without WU’s takeover bid.. now MGI compares to digital payment companies such as square, PayPal etc.. such a comparison guarantees a multi -billion valuation for MGI.. this stock needs patience.. digital payment is a multi-trillion industry and MGI will definitely benefit from the industry’s significant growth potential.. Facebook partnership is alone a strong indicator of the promising outlook for MGI, without taking into consideration the digital transformation of MGI through its own app that is witnessing massive growth"
"International Money Express(IMXI) has a market cap over $400 million, but it only generated over $270 million in revenue. Moneygram(MGI) has a market cap of $100 million, but MGI did over $1.3 billion in revenue. Yes. MGI has a heavy debt load, but it has over $120 million in operating income and increasing revenue vs IMXI's operating income of $3 million. MGI can manage its debt load and can meet its debt obligations. I believe that MGI can easily be acquired for more than $10 per share, which explains what XRP's CEO saw in MGI when it bought into MGI at a price of more than $4 per share. Thus, MGI at $2.5 per share today is truly a gift."
LOL - So the whole thing about releasing a monthly PR regarding digital growth was just to pump up the price for the 100 million offering and securing best possible rate. Now they don't give a damn. And they are not selling either since Alex has this fantasy about fintech evaluation. BTW forget about any offer. Nobody is willing to pay 60+% about current market price. See you next spring maybe for another pump ...
Stellar XLM up 12.53%
Some weird volume here... what's going on?
"Alex Holmes quote on Axios this week, ""We try not to hold crypto on our balance sheet, we try not to be long investors in crypto,"" Holmes says. Why would anyone with knowledge of the financial and tech industry (BS in Accounting, Masters in IT) say this at this point in time? Especially when 20% of all US Dollars circulating were printed in 2020. Just demonstrates that MGI still doesn't understand the full disruptive nature of crypto and what is happening in the financial industry as 32 publicly traded companies now hold BTC on their balance sheets."
Adding more on this dip…I feel that negotiations are taking place but they won’t undervalue their position. No reason for this dip but I won’t pass up the discount.
"it could double but who cares? shoulda just bought btc, long term this is like investing in an undervalued VHS company 10 yrs after DVDs came on the scene."
Most undervalued stock I own
This should be around $15
Why it is tanking? Volume is above average? Is any sale off?

"Big surprise for me was MGI still paying $92M interest expenses per year on debt, that must be a double digit interest rate. They did discuss refinance of debt during Q&A portion and indicated it could not be done before DPA settlement with DOJ (May 2021). That's possibly a lender requirement, so we know the last DoJ payment is May and we know that refinance should be the #1 priority for MGI in May/June timeframe (only 2-3 months from now). Full year interest expense currently represents $1.27+ per share annually and could be one of the quickest ways to boost bottom line EPS and share price in 2021."
First time below $9 since late May and it hardly lasted more than a day.Support has been found.
"I wish MGI Board would approve and announce a 5M share buyback to offset the selling pressure from Ripple. Would only take $25-35M...they have the cash and would put a floor under the stock price. I'm normally not a fan of buybacks, because it shows the company has limited future vision for investments that would produce greater returns than stock, but in this case would be beneficial to demonstrate strength to the market."
Somebody bought a bunch of Sept $15 calls !
Why on middle earth would this drop after such great results and potential buy out that the owner has no apparent interest in given how well the co is doing 
"Never saw such a silent Yahoo group even when things are heating up. I guess MGI doesn't have a lot of retail investors. Did anyone get something out of yesterdays filings?""On June 3, 2021, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, dated as of July 28, 2020, by and between the Company and Equiniti Trust Company, a limited trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, as Rights Agent (the “Rights Agreement”). The Amendment will terminate the Rights Agreement by accelerating the expiration time of the Rights to 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on June 3, 2021. At the time of the termination of the Rights Agreement, all of the Rights, which were distributed to holders of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, pursuant to the Rights Agreement, will expire.The foregoing is a summary of the terms of the Amendment and the Certificate of Elimination of Series E Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company.

"No news creates insecurity. Has digital stalled? How about their B2B solution? We here nothing of new partnerships. Nothing about anything. Only news was an insider sell, and positive effects from refinancing will only materialise in Q4 ie. in the end of January 2022.This will continue to dump until we here positive news from the company which probably aren't there (or they would have been made public).What bummer investment jumping the hype in July. Nothing to do but to wait it out."
"According to the release, Brink’s management intends to continue its strategy of “aggressively pursuing accretive acquisitions in its core business while also implementing its internal organic growth initiatives.”So now to connect the dots:An accretive acquisition increases the synergy between the acquired and the acquirer. The term ""accretive"" is the adjective form of the word ""accretion"", which refers to gradual or incremental growth. Brinks stated that MGI is going to support there plans for SP2, so if this is the initial investment like previously mentioned then we can hope to see more investments being announced June 1,2020 during sp2. Brinks has lots of reasons to synergize with MGI.But as someone stated below, the most important take away is that they see VALUE. Other companies will see it too. This is why it is a grossly undervalued stock; Stay long friends. I am confident this post will age well. Just the way I was preaching stay long when price was 1.4 and mooned to 6..."

Trying to figure out what need the solution is covering. Is it for people with USDC coins in Stellar wallets who can cash these holdings out at MG locations or what is it good for? Also - In what way does MG benefit? Will it add fee paying customers directly?

"It’s a turn around & shorts beginning to cover. The complete melt up of the market will continue. It’s caught shorts, even many hedge funds didn’t see this mammoth melt up coming. Everyone is playing catch up. Some of these stocks will be brought back to life! MGI is one stock that was so raided by shorts there is plenty of room to run for all to make money. Having the crypto exposure is like MJ to the pot stocks companies, total new markets & ready to go “higher”! Keep stacking this one for sure. GL"
When is stellar going to buy this?
"one of these law firms suing MGI had the ""official complaint"" link on their website. So I download and the PDF file had only the address and phone of a lawyer to contact. I contact and ask if they can please provide a copy of the official complain so I may understand, as an investor in MGI for the last few years, what is my situation. They answered not a single one of my questions and simply responded: ""how much did you lose?"". Luckily I lost nothing since I started buying most a year ago @ $1.44. Is it possible this is some sort of shake out attempt prior to a merger / acquisition? I see so many law firms piling on but the details of the complaints are sketchy and unclear."
Another wild card is that they are somehow in negotiation thats tanking or it's a sale by people that were interested in now dumping I've seen this before especially when they start to buy back shares
Valuation is usually based on future value. Why is the potential revenue stream not reflected in the price? This should have been hoovering much higher with the VISA and other partnerships.

"MoneyGram Expands Ripple Partnership with $11.3 Millionhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/moneygram-expands-ripple-partnership-with-113-millionFeb 26, 2020 2:24 AM -05:00• 0The blockchain-based payments firm gave millions to MoneyGram over two quarters in 2019.According to filings through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), money transmission network MoneyGram has gained over $11 million from the blockchain-based payments firm Ripple Labs.In a press release by MoneyGram, the company stated it had received funds from Ripple divided over two quarters: in the fourth quarter, $8.9 million, and $2.4 million in the third, totaling $11.3 million. Its revenue for Q4 was reported to be $323.7 million.""MoneyGram continued to expand its strategic partnership with Ripple as the first money transfer company to scale the use of blockchain capabilities.""Nothing in the SEC filings state what Ripple’s investment will be used for. However, MoneyGram’s agreement with Ripple has previously allowed it to use XRP and its blockchain product ODL(On-Demand liquidity) to facilitate cross-border payments.""[MoneyGram] is compensated by Ripple for developing and bringing liquidity to foreign exchange markets, facilitated by Ripple's blockchain, and providing a reliable level of foreign exchange trading activity. The Company expects that this partnership, at scale, will reduce our working capital needs and generate additional earnings and cash flows."" History of partnerships between MoneyGram and RippleMoneyGram already had financial ties to Ripple. The two firms announced a partnership back in January 2018 for MoneyGram to integrate XRP into its payment system. In June 2019, the two entered into a partnership to collaborate on cross-border payments and foreign exchange settlements with digital assets. Ripple followed through with a $50 million investment, completed that November.Despite this close working relationship, not all money transfer methods are being handled by Ripple. Most recently, MoneyGram unveiled FastSend, a service allowing real-time money sending based on Visa.Share This Article"
Moon boys thank you for keeping the stock IV high. The premium has been great.
"I really like MGI's business model. They have good partnerships with Walmart and Visa. They have good growth prospects, mobile app downloads up 46% in Q1, transactions up 200% over past six months, active users are up 40%. Also from the most recent earnings call, they have the ability to reduce up to 100 million in expenses, meaning they can be more profitable. The also have a benefit from Ripple Labs that allowed them to save 12 million. They also have a lot of potential suitors including 1) Ant/Alibaba (a financial deal that broke down - ANT paid MGI a 30 million penalty when deal failed. Remember this was an $18 cash offer), 2) Western Union, or 3) even perhaps Ripple Labs, a company that may go public in the next 12-18 months and offers a synergistic technology that allows for the settlement of foreign currencies in seconds.So I think MGI has really good prospects going forward and think that eventually they will be bought out.I am BULLISH on MGI."
"Let’s forget about any buyout offer and focus on evaluating the digital money transfer business alone by comparing MGI to PayPal and Square. As indicated by the Management in the earning call, MGI’s revenues from digital business represents 20% of total company’s revenues, representing around $240 million on an annual basis based on current financials. PayPal and Square are currently trading at around 10 times their revenues, which will lead us to a current valuation of around $2.4 billion for MGI digital business alone. Not mentioning that MGI’s digital platform gives users more options for sending and receiving money (much better than PayPal and Square) such as digital to cash and cash to digital in over 300k locations and in more than 200 countries in the world. Also I would like to add that the management might be thinking of spinning off the digital business in the future and selling it separately in an IPO say 60/40 (i.e. a separate fintech company that is 60% owned by MGI). This way, MGI can pay all its debt from IPO proceeds and save millions every year from paying interests, while remaining a major shareholder in the new fintech company that has huge upside potential. Already the management in yesterday’s earnings call mentioned that the digital business is worth billions compared to its peers such as PayPal or Square. Based on the above, MGI should be valued at least at $30 a share. Another hint, the management provided shareholders the right to buy the share at $15 (as a dividend), meaning they see the market price at much higher value in the future. It’s a matter of time before the price explodes. Always do your own research and DD before investing and don’t count on my above analysis as it is based on pure estimates and personal views. Good luck longs"
"Last month, we announced that MoneyGram began using On-Demand Liquidity for payments to the Philippines, and we’re excited to support MoneyGram’s further expansion into Europe and Australia. Digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to make a tremendous impact on cross-border payments - MoneyGram and Ripple is an example of that,” said Brad Garlinghouse, So Ripple being used in 4 corridors, plus 20million investment. I hold long!"
"MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI) introduces a new service through which consumers can send money to their friend's mobile phone number via the MoneyGram website and mobile app.MGI rises 4.8% in after-hours trading.Called MoneyGram FastSend, the new service is supported by Visa (NYSE:V) Direct rails.To use FastSend, customers log in to the MoneyGram app or website, enter the receiver's name and phone number, and select FastSend. A text is sent to the receiver notifying them that they have funds available for deposit. The receiver then logs in, adds their debit card, and the funds are transferred into their bank account within minutes.The service costs $1.99 per transaction from debit cards and has a $10,000 limit per transaction."
The fall today is about trading and manipulation after a big rise. It only opens a new opportunity to get into a company that previously was 200.00plus. The revolutionary new age method of micropayments and the using of xrp by moneygram will propel money gram into a intonanleagie if it’s own. Moneygram has not yet broken into that level of profitability but it is absolutely that very special place that MGI is set in motion to be well over 10.00 in the near term. This is the most advanced digital payment savings position that will be a river of money to moneygram

If we only had a good mkt this would have really rallied today
have there been any updates in regards to stellar buying them out?
"Based on the recent MGI comments (or lack thereof), has this stock has lost its mojo???"
Super technical but we're testing the .618 fib retracement level as well as the .236 fib channel level while currently in a descending wedge...Mid term euphoric price target with the right news could get us up to $30+ and I want to say that is me being conservative.GL

"MoneyGram jumps after announcing extension to Walmart relationshipOct. 6, 2020 9:13 AM ETMoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI) announces a three-year extension to its relationship with Walmart, through March 2024.MGI's service includes Walmart2World, white label money transfer service, are available in over 4,700 Walmart locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as through the co-branded digital platform."
The slow rise towards the anticipation of 3rd Qtr earnings. Hoping for a significant increase in digital revenue.
"Deep in red but not selling. It may well drop again, but there's no way I'll give up my shares. I have learned the lesson"
"My take on MGI's recent price rise and future price action boils down to this: Prior price run-ups were mostly due to actual takeover offers (Or rumors of such). As we know, none panned out. The most notable was China's Ant Financial offer of $1.2 billion. The stock price plummeted after U.S. government officials blocked the sale in January 2018. THIS time however, I believe MGI has risen due to an embrace of digital transactions (Which tend to be more profitable). The most recent earnings report would back this up, and indicates that MGI is outperforming its competitors (And doing a lot of things right). I'm hopeful for further appreciation. My disclaimer is that I'm no wizard at this, and been wrong plenty of times."
KPLT( Katapult Holdings) Thank me later!
Anyone think this will hit $9.50 this week?
"The stock sale makes perfect sense. I think I mentioned it as an option for the company some time ago, I had a hunch ...They already have a seizable cash position, so I guess this will give MoneyGram a lot of leverage in the negotiations with lenders and they should be able to get a much better rate on the refinancing.All money from the possible sales will be used to pay off debt so I guess price/book value doesn't change?And - The offering is modest. Of course short term it'll could keep the stock price in check, but when a hopefully successful refinancing is announced together with a great Q2 we could be on the move again. And who knows what more good news they have in the pipeline ..."
1.2 billion is their last year annual revenue because of bad 1st 2 quarter (pandemic hit) ... it generally ranges between 1.5 to 1.6 billion ... if we double it 3 billion market cap gives it a share price of 40 dollar ... if we make count it as 4 billion it gives a stock price in 50s... but for that they have to give positive net income quarter after quarter and lower/refinance their debt ... which is clearly their strategy ... one road block is q3 results of 2021 ... where they have to pay 55 million for closing dpa with doj ... that quarter will have negative eps ... we will see a dip ... but in general ... I clearly see it stock price to 50 dollars by 2022 ... people have to be patient and understand it’s a recovery stock ... which could give as good as return as a growth stock ... this is the most conservative estimate ... I am not talking speculations on merger ... or pay pal buying or ripple winning lawsuit ... I am talking about clear fundamentals based on balance sheet and macro trends ... if you want a 4x to 5X stock by next year ... load it up today and keep buying the dips ... that’s what I did in last 2 years ... one last thing if you see senior management of a company loading up its own company shares that’s a clear sign that they believe on future of a company ... please go and check out moneygram investors relation sec page ... cfo and directors have acquired consistently companies shares in last 3 months ....
Stellar XLM will control peer to peer! Billions or transactions! Instantly! MoneyGram already does $2 billion a year! With Stellar? $6B and if Advent merges another company with them? Which is the plan! $100 to $500 Billion Transactions a year!
"Every single time we get a bunch of posts warning us about this plummeting, it catapults us to the new higher level. If we listened to these folks at $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...many of us would not be sitting on 450% gains. If they did even a few minutes of research they would see (1) triple digit growth in digital, (2) earnings and free cash flow accelerating, (3) brick and mortar expenses being slashed, (4) VISA and other partnerships exploding around the globe, (5) additional stimulus means more record transaction volume, (6) potential crypto tie-in with Ripple/XRP or other platforms/tokens, and (7) increased institutional accumulation."
Is there anyone on this board who has a reasonable prediction for a possible buyout price? <$15? $15 - $20? >$20?
So all you posters who went bananas up to earnings. I guess you have learned your lesson. I hope not too many newbies got burnt from all the hype on this board.
"Ripple announced a partnership with International Money Express Inc, yesterday. IMXI has market value over 20x that of MGI, and is months behind in opening ODL corridors. Means 2 things:1. Competitors to MGI agree on the best disruptive strategy to seize their portion of the settlement market2. Competitors are months behind MGI in this strategy and technical development 2.1 - Notice how MGI has announced strategic partnerships in the top remittance countries globally (India, Egypt, Philippeans etc..) most of these are exclusive. MGI got there first, everyone else will be chasing for scraps.IMO, LONG MGI"
"My understanding is the partnership with Ripple has opened up a giant market for MGI- to go after financial institutions instead of individuals-- moving large amount of dollars, instead of the previous consumer market where it was lots of nickels and dimes. Does this sound right? Like MGI would have a professional sales team calling on institutions that move volume cross border- and using Ripple technology, they can do this cheaper and faster? This would be ""disruptive"" to the old business plan-- they conference call eluded to plans but they wouldn't say what anything was. If this is the plan though, this company is really undervalued here.... if it works out. I do know Ripple has a bunch of money to throw at this to make it work."
"The continued triple digit growth rate announced by MGI puts them on track for over $60M in digital revenue and approaching $375M+ in quarterly revenue for Q4, according to my model. If expense line holds steady, we should see solid EPS surprise and cash balance approaching $200M."
I wanted to see MGI do a deal with Ethereum (like VISA) after the XRP meltdown. ETH is on fire after the London hardfork!
Unlimited upside for Stellar! And IBM news isn’t even out too! More news!
"Wow, great earnings report and DPA/Refi savings going forward and this is getting beat up worse than when we had so-so reports and the pressure of Ripple selling shares. Fintel showing 74% institutional ownership, which shows accumulation. Probably just consolidate in a range between $8.34 and $10.70 until next earnings report or some kind of positive news."
"Somebody came in with a market order of like 160,000 shares!"
Me thinks this was a major dump to shake out weak hands and acquire shares cheaper by those interested in this buyout talk! Anyone else feel the same? Down fast and fizzled out!
Thomas Lee Partners holds the largest block of MGI institutional shares at around 24 million. A distribution of 18.5 million of those is huge. Who got them ? That is the million dollar question. Is Ripple or Visa involved somehow ? We'll know soon. Exciting.
"Equity Investment in MoneyGram InternationalDuring the quarter, Brink’s invested $9 million in MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI) common stock through open market purchases equaling approximately 4.95% of its outstanding shares. Brink’s and MoneyGram are in discussions to develop a long-term strategic partnership agreement that has the potential to yield significant commercial benefits for both companies. MoneyGram is one of the largest money transfer companies in the world, with 350,000 locations in more than 200 countries. In the fourth quarter, Brink’s recorded a non-cash charge of $3 million or $.05 per share related to a decrease in the fair market value of its initial investment."
I'm with Letitgrow. I'm 100% comfortable right now...
"Think about it....Brinks moves physical money from point A to point B. They are being strategic and moving toward a business that is embracing Crypto to move money using the Internet of Value (IoV) and specifically Crypto - XRP So I'm grabbing me some Brinks, MGI, and XRP...woohooI'm pretty sure they don't want to miss the evolution that this technology is bringing to the world. Like the telecom companies missed the Cellphone industry and stayed with Payphones way to long. HAHA!"
Ripple investment in Q4 looking good.XRP on a roll

"In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per one share of Common Stock.I'm surprised that none of you seem to read what was on the 8K. Let me break down the maths for you here:I have 60K common shares as of Aug 7th. The 60K shares = 60K Rights. Each right give me the option to buy 0.001 preferred share at $15 per right. Let's say I'm feeling rich and exercise all rights. I bought 60K rights, costing me $900K. Now, here comes WU coming with a 1:1 offer, $24 per share for WU, and $4 per share for MGI on that day. My 60K common shares give me a profit of that day at ($24-$4)*60K = 1.2MBUT that's not ALL I will get. My 60K rights bought at $900K will also give me a dividend at: (60 preferred share * 20*1000) = another $1.2M. (300K profit)Wth does a company put such useless clause in the 8K? To preserve the carrying tax benefits? Gimme a break. Also, ask around, everyone is talking about a 1:1 offer from WU. The issue is MGI is wanting even more than the 1:1"
will come some Year when mgi get better revenue? :)
Breakout imminent!Shorts are done! $15 coming:
"The San Francisco startup has also released a quote from MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes, who says the company is expanding its use of ODL.“One of the core strengths of MoneyGram is our global liquidity and settlement engine that enables our customers to send money in over 200 countries and territories.
