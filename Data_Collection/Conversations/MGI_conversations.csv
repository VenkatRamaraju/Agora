Probably would make more sense spin off MGO & unlock greater value. MGO alone can easily be $1B company. Very much undervalued here.
seems like a great Q3 report...so I bet the price tanks tomorrow :()
"We should get earnings announcement within the next 10 trading days. Looking to see what leadership is doing with the extra cash. Regardless of Q3 report, market will react mostly to Q4 guidance."
"Bought a lot of MGI during the summer of 2020 based on a simple observation (From $2.75-$3.5). I sent money to Mexicali, MX, and the recipient told me the wait at the store was 1 1/2 hours and the line stretched out to the street. Of course the stock off. Though the pandemic is still lingering, those lines are now completely gone. Is this decrease in brick and mortar action the reason the stock has pulled back? I don't know, but MGI has tried to stimulate business by lowering their fee to $3.99 (Great for consumers, maybe not so for MGI)? Anyway, under $6 feels like a steal."
Wait now the shorts are empty soon the rise will begin
finally a sparkle!
Am i the only one here thinking MGI will beat earnings?

Shorts are trying to force a selloff. It will bounce back.

Gonna continue buying it
Where is the huge bag holder Index . May not here from that JO again.
"MoneyGram has announced that is partnering with the Stellar Development Foundation, a nonprofit organization, to enable cash funding and payout in local currency for consumers using U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC), along with almost instantaneous back-end settlements, according to a press release.The partnership will let customers convert USDC to cash or vice versa, which will boost utility and liquidity of digital assets, the release stated. It will also allow more consumers to access the digital economy.“At MoneyGram, one of our top strategic priorities is to pioneer cross-border payment innovation and blockchain-enabled settlement, and we’re thrilled to now work with the Stellar Development Foundation to further our efforts,” said MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes in the release. “As crypto and digital currencies rise in prominence, we’re especially optimistic about the potential of stablecoins as a method to streamline cross-border payments. Given our expertise in global payments, blockchain and compliance, we are extremely well-positioned to continue to be the leader in building bridges to connect digital currencies with local fiat currencies.”Settlements with MoneyGram will now happen in near-instant with USDC, which will improve the collection of funds, boost efficiency and decrease risk, according to the release.Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director Denelle Dixon said in the release that the partnership shows “how blockchain technology and stablecoins bring new opportunities to global customers and enhance the existing financial system.”She said a new swathe of cash users will now “be able to convert their cash into and out of USDC,” which will help them get faster, more nimble digital asset services, per the release.MoneyGram has been a target of takeover interests as it has moved further away from legacy services. In July, Stellar and private equity firm Advent International were mulling the acquisition of MoneyGram."
"So what is cooking at MoneyGram International?Why haven't they announced an earnings date yet? That is not normal. Will they do a preliminary release or is it too late for that already?It is probably a complicated quarter due to refinancing but still. They should be able to announce a date very soon.The SP price from now and the next few months could be anything between 6 and 9 USD. Hype from digital transformation is gone, and it seems that they won't and can't ride that horse anymore. So then what? Revenue was a positive surprise in Q2, will they be able to maintain that?"
Will we get a 20+% run up prior to Oct 29 earnings like Q2 (target $8.50 - $9) or possibly a 60+% run after earnings like Q1 (target $11+)? Strong earnings guidance for Q4 would certainly help ignite a post-earnings climb.
Totally oversold
I think Street will like these numbers and strong Q4 guidance. Should be last time we see these one-time debt refi expenses and inflated interest expenses pulling the bottom line down.
"The last 10% drop seemed to be due to the news about Facebooks Novi could be an existential threat to MoneyGram and Western Union. It's not quite there yet but it's fast approaching. What's not to like about using Novi that offers transfers free of charge around the globe? Only weak spot I can find is the off ramp fiat converting the stable coin to local currency, and even cash. MoneyGram needs to partner with someone big to counter this, or?"
"About Novi and crypto (from CC):""Myself I loaded $1,000 to Coinbase the other day. And the first thing it told me is that you've loaded a $1,000. Thank you. And it says you can get back $28 today if you want, or you can get a $1,000 back in seven days. So they've definitely tied up the money. And once it's in, you can buy and sell crypto and it's pretty easy. But the first thing you noticed is that you pay 1.5% to 2% to buy your crypto.And then once you own it, there's a lot you can do because now you're on chain. You can move it around, you can send it to people, you can do a variety of things, but then you decide, you want to get your money back. You push, sell the coins are sold. Do you want that into some Fiat currency? It costs again, 1% to 2% to convert it back. And it's going to take you a couple of three days to get the cash. In fact, if you do a domestic transaction on Novi right now, you can easily move money through USDP, but it'll tell you, it's going to take you three days to get your cash back. And for those of you who understand our industry and understand most financial transactions waiting three days, seven days in the case of getting your $1,000 back out of your wallet is really not a timeline that's acceptable. I mean, our entire industry exists for the sole purpose of moving money instantly in real time.""""And so, this is idea that you can move money through crypto rapidly fast, it's easy, it's seamless. And in a lot of ways, that's true, but you can do the same thing in the Fiat world today.So the question becomes the interoperability and the question becomes the speed at which you can settle that. And so what we've done is integrated with Stellar through USDC. And so anyone who wants to convert their crypto into USDC and then ask for that cash out, they can receive that cash instantly to the MoneyGram network. And that's pretty remarkable and transformational because most crypto is in essence, stuck on chain and getting at off chain is incredibly expensive and slow and complicated. And so for us, it's a very straightforward. Effectively, we can turn USDC into a money transfer for purposes of the consumer collecting those funds effectively time and instantly the way that we send money today, right.""I like to read that sort of stuff!"
Time to load up!! Easy double. I have no problem being patient.
"I had a dentist appointment, so didn't catch the call. Looking at the slides, the digital business looks incredibly strong and free cash flow at $24M per quarter to add to the $154M in bank. VISA Direct is killing it, so I wouldn't be surprised if VISA comes to the table with a premium cash/stock offer for MGI."
"Wow never expected this, had to add some more at these levels"
"Like clockwork....Conference call scheduled for Friday, October 29 at 9 a.m. ETDALLAS, Oct. 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- MoneyGram International, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGI) will announce its third quarter 2021 financial results on Friday, October 29, 2021."
This chart is what manipulation looks like
"Fintel reporting that more than 72% of MGI stock now held by institutions. That doesn't leave a lot of shares in the float. If we get a Q3 beat or even positive Q4 guidance, this is primed for a big move."
Wow - No interest at all in this company. What a miracle that they could offload 10 million shares in July at around 10 bucks. Huge mistanke by the buyers
Let's say you're a wealthy hedge fund. You buy all the 10 million shares offered by MoneyGram in July. Then you at the same time short another 10 million shares and then slow starts to sell your real shares over the course of a few months pushing to the already ongoing sellof. Leaves you with a healthy profit in the end where you can nice and quitely cover your short. Ok one single entity can't hold 10 million shares without disclosing but there probably exist work arounds on that
Fundamentals is good growing and revenue is up what’s not to like worst case buy out loading at basement prices
1st step then full merger. Making sense now?
Maybe they should change the name to MetaGram International and keep symbol MGI?
If Alex don't get this slide under control it may be the end of the road for him. Only thing saving him is the lack of an activist investor like Carl Icahn as well as the lack of separation between the CEO and Chairman role.
"Benzinga news: ""MoneyGram US Patent & Trademark Office Abstract For Co.'s 'Systems and method for providing a data security service"". Anyone knows what this is about??"
"Fintech competition:""If you spend a lot of time on the Wise website, one of the things that they do is they put a list of who their price is better than and MoneyGram is not on there anymore. It used to be, but it's dropped off and we're not on there anymore because we're extremely price competitive with what they're doing. And I would argue that most of the prices that Remitly is doing other than their first transaction, which they give a big discount on and by the way, they put into their marketing expense is, other than that, our pricing is super competitive. So I feel very, very good about that.""When the market discovers what MoneyGram has done, it's too late to do catch up"
Trying to figure out what need the solution is covering. Is it for people with USDC coins in Stellar wallets who can cash these holdings out at MG locations or what is it good for? Also - In what way does MG benefit? Will it add fee paying customers directly?
Pre market looking promising. Let’s hope the dip is over and start heading back towards 13$ with tomorrow’s earning call
Down 45 percent in 30 days not bad
Sold some tsla before for my second position way way back. And now recently sold some more tsla to add to my third position & plenty more ready to go. Ranting chris kid has no idea. He wants to act big with his 3000 shares. His mother forgot to teach him humility. Lol.
"Ya know, big brother aka Western Union for the last year is up -8% as of today while MGI is up over 50%! Biggest mistake WU ever made is to not buy MGI!!"
The stock is up 16 cents on a very good day for the mkt and index ahuge bag holder (his words not mine) thinks he hit lotto. Can't make this stuff up.
