"Great time to add to your Long positions here folks. If you can just stop watching the price daily and come back in 3 years, you will likely be rewarded"
"""If investors back out multiple years, they'd see a company growing its user base well within its historic range.What's arguably far more important is that Pinterest continues to see its average revenue per user (ARPU) soar, even as its MAUs retrace a bit. Global ARPU was up 89% in the June-ended quarter, with 163% ARPU growth from international users."""
this is like a parallel world to the Nasdaq..slowly im losing my patience
See you guys at 80. I have bought enough for now but will add more if we drop below 52... Happy Investing
Boys I could get this stock to go higher if you want...all I would need to do is open a short position. Always seems to make things go higher :)
"Just read article on economy and covid surge. If there is widespread restrictions in the 4Q, or 'shut-downs' whether they be outright by edict or even just in effect, PINS is going to get a boost from that. If the Co. shows further ARPU growth on the November Call, AND there's a surge in covid, it's going to be a very Merry Christmas for PINS' Longs."
$200-$300 is the 5 year target. Buy @$50/$40 really makes no difference. Can't time the market.
"Market down, this is up. I’ll take it. Things bode well, especially long term."
Good progress today in a tough market for an oversold company..onwards to 60s next week
Still holding from $15. Just hold folks.
"From recent MF article:""Looking at MAUs in more detail, Pinterest lost 24 million MAUs in its fiscal Q2 from Q1. What made it worse was in those totals, 7 million MAUs were lost from the U.S. Why is that important? Users from the U.S. bring in multiples more in revenue compared to international users. Indeed, the U.S.'s average revenue per user (ARPU) was $5.08 in the most recent quarter, compared to $0.36 internationally. Therefore, losing one user from the U.S. is equivalent to losing 14 million internationally. Expanding on the thought further, MAUs from the U.S. brought in an ARPU of $18.86 over the last four quarters. So if you multiply that over the 7 million MAUs it lost, it highlights a potential loss of $133 million in annual revenue for Pinterest. That's a meaningful loss considering the company earned $1.7 billion in revenue in 2020. Understandably, the stock would sell off after that kind of news. However, there was one statement in the company's shareholder letter that may indicate the loss is not as bad as it looks on the surface:Virtually all of the difference between our Q2 MAU guidance and our actual Q2 MAUs is attributable to a decline in MAUs who use Pinterest on the web. These users have tended to be less engaged and generate less revenue than Pinners who visited our mobile apps directly. In Q2, MAUs on our mobile apps grew in the U.S. year over year, and grew by more than 20% internationally.In other words, the company lost lower-value MAUs in the U.S. in the most recent quarter and actually increased higher-value MAUs in the U.S. That statement could mean that the overall loss in users may not have as significant of an impact on revenue as investors may think. What this could mean for investors Other than the reported MAU losses in the U.S., Pinterest presented a fantastic quarter. Revenue increased by 125% from the year before, and management guided for 40% year-over-year growth in the next quarter. In addition, the company turned the corner on profitability as net income was $69 million, after losing $101 million the year before."""
Some big buys taking it green there. String finish to close the week would be appreciated.
My average share cost is $77. Let’s keep this train chugging along uphill!!
Buy buy before the stock snaps back
"Holding a stock for YEARS is NOT easy. On the contrary. Even without nasty sell-offs like the last 8 weeks it's still brutally hard. So easy to push that button and collect your gains. In large part because sometimes, that's the smart thing to do. Not always. But sometimes. But it's not the right thing to do here with PINS. Because very soon, it will become apparent that there is no better platform in the World, to spend your advertising dollars. Facebook has peaked and has already begun it's descent. Pinterest is only going to take more and more of that e-commerce advertising pie with each passing year. So patience yeah it's a TOUGH gig. But PINS will be $100, $150, $200 per share. NOT tomorrow. But in due time. And then your complaint will be, 'why didn't I buy more shares when it was n double-digits?' lol."
With Covid on the surge the stay at home stocks will surge again next quarter! Users will go up in fall/winter as normal plus Covid surge will result in big growth for pins!
Red because ^TNX is green. Long term investors no need to worry. $300 target 3-5 years.
added some to long portfolio . at this price was one of the easiest decisions in a while.
Green is feeling good
"There’s Tik Tok videos going around with creators praising PINS. Creators and small business owners are getting 500x the views and engagement than FB, Insta, Twitter, Tik Tok… this is huge potential for reach. And they’re nit even sponsored posts!!"
This is a good stock to own for years.Very low debt level and awesome revenue growth.
"From MF article, this is what you're Holding with PINS: ""In fact, I think Pinterest is building the commerce platform of tomorrow. Consider this: Let's say you search Pinterest for ""summer fashion,"" and you find a shirt you like; Pinterest can help you find out where to buy it. And later this year, the company will debut on-platform transactions, meaning you'll be able to purchase that shirt directly through Pinterest. But that only scratches the surface of what this platform could be.Going back to your search results, let's say you notice the denim model is wearing nice shoes. You can actually zoom in on the shoes, and Pinterest will use its AI engine to find the product (and visually similar items). Now you can buy those shoes, or something similar, even if you don't know the brand. Better yet, let's say you see someone wearing the shoes in real life (or elsewhere on the internet); you can snap a picture with your smartphone, or otherwise upload that image to Pinterest, and get the same result.Now, imagine the potential of blending Pinterest with augmented reality (AR) glasses in the future. Wherever you go, whatever you see, it would all be shoppable.""If Pinterest becomes an online destination to both shop AND PURCHASE, it will rival Amazon, and PINS will rival AMZN. Certainly a far lesser rival. But rival just the same."
this stock could easily go back to 90$ plus it's way oversold right at the moment
OVERSOLD good entry point!!
ok so i have a few shares at this nice dip-discount... now i am considering to go 3 years long... it could be the next facebook at 300 a piece....
A green day it is. Nice to see that keeping a pace.
Can’t wait to buy things directly through the app. So much potential and still attractively cheap
Only down a few cents on a downgrade. That tells me the bottom is most likely in. Little reaction to “bad” news.
"loaded up again yesterday. this is too predictable-take advantage of the price manipulation people. This will run up into first quarter 2022. Way oversold-anytime you can load up under $60, do it!!"
$300 is the long term target. Buy and hold.
think my initial buy at 55 last week will pay dividends...Nice few days action for an oversold stock. onwards to 60+
"all shorts and dumpers should know...i bought in the low 50... great oppertunity... im not selling in the near future, and im not alone... pins is gonne boom this year!!!"
Love my Pins!
Great buy at these prices
EOY target $85. 5yr target $300. 40% revenue growth till 2026 with 15 P/S gives us $300+. ARPU is key to these assumptions.
Pay day today. I have added to my position. Been adding since it dropped below 60. See you guys at 80 then 100.
This thing should have been at 100 already...but if I sell I know it will be 100 after next earnings....
"I have always said and will say again, 3 to 5 years is when this stock will be zooming. Buy the dips and hold. They are building something very special."
Here we go
Just hold. You’ll be fine.
