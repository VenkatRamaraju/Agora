Another explosive earning in 4 weeks. This stock will be over 60 in the next couple of weeks! Hold and buy more if you can.
"What is the CAGR for MAU if you compare 2021 to 2019 and not 2020, which we all know was an anomaly? Looks pretty goodm huh? Combine that with increase in revenue per user."
Nice % move but volume isn't as good. Nothing I'd like to see more than $50 be THE bottom. Hopefully PINS gets some real Buying heading into the Earnings Call.
Pinterest gets 80 million beauty-related searches monthly. Stop think about it.People come onto pins and search for beauty… 80 million….
"Ok, buying more today. Couldn't buy it yesterday. Still can't believe this is under 60. My wife loves PINS so she doesn't mind but man a double up within the next 12 months is too great to pass up. Been here since 22.50.Happy Investing"
This is me now lol
Bought PINS and MA today
There is still a lot of over head volume to work through
We should be heading up a bit more. It’s not enough
sorry but I got to call this at this price BS. stop buying calls! buy the stock lol
Buying more again this week. Looks like they are selling into earnings. That is a beautiful thing for a long like me.
Thank you  Pins finally….
This stock has been sliding down hill since earnings report. How low will it go before reversal?
Green EOD
The next earnings can’t come fast enough ... looking forward to seeing how high this is going to go
I'm holding and buying few thousand more Pinterest stocks. Wait few weeks and you will see at least $65
There's a lot of growth stocks that get the benefit of the doubt. PINS sure as hell isn't one of them.
"From recent MF article:""Looking at MAUs in more detail, Pinterest lost 24 million MAUs in its fiscal Q2 from Q1. What made it worse was in those totals, 7 million MAUs were lost from the U.S. Why is that important? Users from the U.S. bring in multiples more in revenue compared to international users. Indeed, the U.S.'s average revenue per user (ARPU) was $5.08 in the most recent quarter, compared to $0.36 internationally. Therefore, losing one user from the U.S. is equivalent to losing 14 million internationally. Expanding on the thought further, MAUs from the U.S. brought in an ARPU of $18.86 over the last four quarters. So if you multiply that over the 7 million MAUs it lost, it highlights a potential loss of $133 million in annual revenue for Pinterest. That's a meaningful loss considering the company earned $1.7 billion in revenue in 2020. Understandably, the stock would sell off after that kind of news. However, there was one statement in the company's shareholder letter that may indicate the loss is not as bad as it looks on the surface:Virtually all of the difference between our Q2 MAU guidance and our actual Q2 MAUs is attributable to a decline in MAUs who use Pinterest on the web. These users have tended to be less engaged and generate less revenue than Pinners who visited our mobile apps directly. In Q2, MAUs on our mobile apps grew in the U.S. year over year, and grew by more than 20% internationally.In other words, the company lost lower-value MAUs in the U.S. in the most recent quarter and actually increased higher-value MAUs in the U.S. That statement could mean that the overall loss in users may not have as significant of an impact on revenue as investors may think. What this could mean for investors Other than the reported MAU losses in the U.S., Pinterest presented a fantastic quarter. Revenue increased by 125% from the year before, and management guided for 40% year-over-year growth in the next quarter. In addition, the company turned the corner on profitability as net income was $69 million, after losing $101 million the year before."""
Yesterday's price broke support at 52 but was bought up above support before the day's close. We are still currently in a descending triangle but if the price closes below 52 we will be in an official downtrend. Should that happen look for the price to drop to 44-46 before moving up again.
"As always,disappointing"
This thing is finished. See ya in the 40’s
"profitable, growing, billions in cash and shorts playing games. I know the game. I will continue to hold and add. I have no problem growing my four-figure position. The games will stop eventually."
Heading underwater in a few mins
one-off / one day event or is it the start of the reversal?
Nice pullback. We will continue our climb
"Shorts want to convince you the stock price is going down every day and it almost feels like it. However, price has been going sideways and yet to break support of 52 since August 19th. This is exactly why they are coming on daiy to make you feel like you should see. If they can convince enough of you, price will break below 52 and possibly drop as low as 46 short term which would make them a TON of money. I hope you fellow longs who are willing to hold for 2 years or more have the confidence to not be swayed. As much as I wouldn't mind buying cheaper shares, Id prefer to reverse course now than later. Don't sell and help the shorts."
"It's kind of ridiculous how Pins lost more % than other social media stocks while the company didn't have any problems with servers, their revenue keeps growing and covid is still there making people more ""ideas from the Internet"" dependent. Plus October-January got some huge holidays boosting future Pin's activity."
Pinterest gets 80 million beauty-related searches monthly.
"Red, red, red, day after day after day. Pretty depressing. But have you noticed the stock really isn't going anywhere? The volume is never above 11M and it's just trading sideways between $52 and $58. If $52 gives on volume we'll see the low $40's here in my opinion. Maybe even $40 itself. If $58 gives on volume you've got the 50-day line at $62 currently and the 200- at $69, with the gap filling at $72. All this weakness started because MAU's didn't measure up to last year's Q2 when covid had the world locked inside their homes. Asinine. Meanwhile what happens this coming winter if Authorities use covid to enact shut-downs again in full or in part? This goes as low at the low $40's I'll be liquidating other Holdings to BUY another chunk of shares and Calls going out as far as 2023. Patience PAYS, and I'm in no rush."
Can’t wait to buy things directly through the app. So much potential and still attractively cheap
"I remember when I got married Microsoft was $25, 23 years ago. I remember when Facebook was about $18 around 12 years ago. In 2035 I’ll be looking back hopefully at Pins and saying , I remember when no Pins was $15 and see that it’s at least $250. Nice fantasy anyway."
Dislocation between the Value of a company and the price of the stock is how big money is made. AMD at $74 a couple months ago is the same AMD at $110. Pins at $56 is the same company as pins at $80.
this is one of the safest place at this level imo .. IV added to my long.
"From MF article today:""Pinterest: Down 44% from its 52-week highSocial media up-and-comer Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has been pummeled since late July, which is when the company announced a sequential quarterly reversal of its monthly active user (MAU) growth. In total, Pinterest had 454 million MAUs, down from 478 million MAUs in the first quarter. But if you look at Pinterest's historic MAU growth over three or more years, you'd see that a single quarter fluctuation doesn't change the company's growth trajectory.What's far more important to recognize is that Pinterest's relatively slower growth in the second quarter didn't alter advertisers desire to reach these users. Average revenue per user (ARPU) catapulted higher by 89% globally in the June-ended quarter, with 163% ARPU growth noted internationally. International ARPU could double multiple times this decade, which should allow Pinterest to sustain double-digit sales growth throughout the decade.Something else that's often overlooked with Pinterest is that its user base can be targeted better than any other social media platform. With users willingly sharing the things, places, and services that interest them, Pinterest simply needs to keep its MAUs engaged and connect them with merchants specializing in their interests. This ability to target specific users should give Pinterest exceptional ad pricing power.""Now that Pinterest has posted a profitable Q, they need to post another that will cause the Analyst Universe to forget all about User Growth Rate and instead focus on Quarterly Growth Rate. Stocks are nota. proxy for 'Users', they are a proxy for 'EARNINGS'. Pinterest Management needs to use Results and Guidance especially to remind Analysts of this."
Loading up BIG on Pinterest heading into earnings. This company has to be making hand over fist cash. Everyone is hooked on social media.
3 and 1/2 weeks to a blowout earnings report!
"Payday tomorrow, please hold this level!"
Payday is Thursday. Ready to add more to my core position. Loveeeee these levels
"RBC Capital Initiates Coverage On Pinterest with Sector Perform Rating, Announces Price Target of $58"
"If there will be no Buying of PINS before the Earnings Call, as I've said before, Management is going to have to hit it out of the Stadium to entice Accumulation. Because those waiting and wanting to see if User growth is still not comparable to global pandemic last year are going to be rewarded. It isn't. Probably never will be again, unless there's another widespread lock-down. So that news will probably be sold off hard again."
Long and not being pessimistic but its better stay cautious. MAU of September drops 10% MoM comparing to August if you check.
"I know I know you all are wondering. YES I am still shorting, made a mint!!"
"Bounce back later today in trading or tomorrow, most all stocks are down today."
Come’on legend !!!! 
We have a nice wall.
Blowout Earnings 3 weeks away!
Green by EOD
We should expect a sudden surge to $68 next week. Watch out this counter..
Finally!!!!!Fly away!!!!!
shorts are playing with fire at this level
added some to long portfolio . at this price was one of the easiest decisions in a while.
Enough is enough already!!!!!
sell 35
"It's not just $TDOC, have people looked at other growth stocks? Almost all of them (the 20x+ sales types) have been crushed. $PINS, $ZM, $ROKU, $FVRR, . . .Down 30% or more. Has to do with:1.) massive overvaluations2.) stay-at-home trades getting re-rated3.) rising 10-year Treasury (which crushes high multiple stocks)4.) inflation rising and sticking5.) gridlock on infrastructure/stimulus (in which this possible tax hikes on the rich)With regard to possible persistent higher inflation, the argument is that growth stocks do worse, because their earnings are far into the future. If inflation is persistent and higher in the future, then the value of those earnings could be a lot less (unless they have pricing power to raise prices). Value stocks, by contrast, have their earnings more in the here and now. Take $BMY trading at a 9 P/E vs $ZM trading at an 80 P/E. $ZM's valuation takes the bigger hit, because it's earnings will be worth much less (it is argued) from future persistent inflation. You also had end-of-quarter ""window dressing"" and ""mark ups"" by fund managers, who want to hide their losses and pretend they held the winners this quarter all along, which led to some late-September selling. In short, LOTS of growth stocks took a hit this quarter. $TDOC is not alone (despite my not liking the company for other reasons - have you seen the scandals/criticisms on its Wikipedia page?)."
"Behold #$%$inine:""Shares of Pinterest have taken a huge beating in recent months, driven both by a broader-market decline (particularly for growth stocks) and news that the social media platform's monthly active users in the U.S. declined 7% year over year during the first 27 days of July. In addition, global growth in monthly active users slowed from 9% year over year in the second quarter to 5% in July, management said in the company's second-quarter earnings release in late July. Pinterest stock has lost more than a third of its value over the last three months, and shares are down 11% over the last 30 days.Of course, investors shouldn't base their opinion of whether a stock is a good investment or not based solely on the market's latest sentiment toward it. It's worth noting that Pinterest's top and bottom lines are growing very rapidly. Analysts, on average, expect third-quarter revenue to grow 43% and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share to nearly double."""
"We need to get to 60, to start filling that gap. Come on!"
wow. 55 call options for Jan 2023 I bought @15.00 thinking is the bottom!!! I can buy Jan 2024 with the same price now! Call options are just too cheap now and it scares me!
Microsoft should just buy them out
This is how longs are looking like
Added this morning at $50.42. But next gap down in the $46s from last October. Soon those $40 days will be gone and this new lows will be 52 week lows. But I still like the value proposition here.
My favorite social media platform to own. This company is never in any drama
"Super bullish on Pins. Already was my best performing stock this year. Bought in, made 40% - Sold and have bought back in recently. Going to repeat and might make 50-60%.. I’m all for this stock dipping more though to load up. Unfortunately the Motley Fool and others keep bringing attention to it driving up the price"
Does this news about Apple making advertising more difficult for Facebook help Pinterest?
Thsi company has been a disaster since day 1
Red because ^TNX is green. Long term investors no need to worry. $300 target 3-5 years.
"FWIW volume is 200% of typical by this time of the day. This isn't a false move. Quote 53.7 +2.75,+5.4%L 51.24 O 51.24 H 53.97Volume 1.79mil +200% typical"
inverted head and shoulders
Buckle up folks!
the stock price was just back to last Friday's price.. Congrats! But still a rough road to get back to $80.
"Seeing resistance at 50, one more drop before this thing tests 60 again!!!!"
This thing should have been at 100 already...but if I sell I know it will be 100 after next earnings....
Hedge funds are cutting and running leaving individuals holding the bag. Are you or will you be one of them ?
Wait until the end of September... We will see $60. Check my Analysis on twitter. @ndrknc
"Stocks don’t go up every day. Daily chart doesn’t make the charts, it’s the yearly chart that does! 2023 will be $120-150 that’s my 3cents"
When is the last time this had a green week?
Love the sale! Shopping heavy today
"Just wondering if anyone sees this stock reaching 90+ at any point over the next 2 years? And, if so, based on what?"
All of us LONG in 10 years
Only down a few cents on a downgrade. That tells me the bottom is most likely in. Little reaction to “bad” news.
"I have always said and will say again, 3 to 5 years is when this stock will be zooming. Buy the dips and hold. They are building something very special."
"$PINS is a combination of $EBAY $ANZN and $ETSY to name a few. People do not realize it yet.Pinterest, is a platform for all. Every retail wants to be there.It's just a beginning. Pins is in the basement build up, of a skyscraper. Profit is growing. DAU are irrelevant. Pareto effect states, 80% of wealth belongs 20% of people.20% of Pins users generate 80% of profits.. the rest are just browsers. Pinterest is not a good company, it is a Great company, Company with great concept. It is branding itself now, worldwideBuy it now in circa $50.Put it away for 5 years, then look it up.Best regards to all."
4 weeks till earnings.
Thanks for keeping this price below 60 for nearly a month to allow me to add to my core position!#Winnining
Will we see $70 until the next earning in October? Yes.I'm still holding and will buy more in this great dip!You will never see this chance again for PINS! Take your chance!!!
$60+ soon
"Pretty lousy action, despite everyone saying “$200 stock in a few years,” etc. Maybe so. I’ll stick with it. One thing is for sure: these analysts are all a bunch of amateurs. Wonder if they ever had real jobs…."
Buying….In a few months you will wish you bought more…Download the app… pick your fav things … you will understand
$300 is the long term target. Buy and hold.
"For chartists (if that's a word), this is exactly what you want. 16 of the last 20 days have been below average volume and very tight pricing. It means people aren't selling. Lots of good videos on this type of pattern out there."
amazing most the puts are 51 and most of the calls are 54. can't make this stuff up. lol
Going to $60+
it will consolidate in the 54-58 range before testing resistance at 60/61 is we break that then 66 is next stop
"How many shares do you want to own? I personally would love to get up to 2,000 one day but have a long way to go."
Every time we get this afternoon reversal I think the bottom is in. I’ll believe it when we break through 60.
Who purchased in the last weeks more than 5 million stocks of PINTEREST? Does anyone know? Which hedge fond?
What - Pins is not red? Where'd this 6% green day come from?Happy to see it of course - just wondered if it's based on anything substantial.
60-65 by end of September
"Nice little hammer off Support at $55.64 yesterday, and on rapidly dwindling volume. Selling looks just about exhausted. And that gap is hanging over shorts/sellers head like the Sword of Damocles."
all this BS on this gem. I'm long and it's looking very good at this price.
Will Pin be able to regain active user rate and user growth rate? I believe the upcoming quarter is very critical especially on those two rates. so far this is the worst performance stock among all social media sector within 1 year. I invested in since IPO and I would move on if this quarter doesn't show any improvement for active user growth rate.
PEOPLE are going to be dumping FB for PINS !
Going to $60+++++
"If you considering wether to buy, sell or hold and are willing to hold for 5 years consider this. Using a 25% growth rate for future revenue and comparing PINS market cap against similar companies like FB, PINS fair market value in 2026 should be roughly 170. That's a 34% YOY return on your money. If you really want to be extremely conservative, even if PINS is only 100$ by then, your still earning almost 20% return year over year. Either way, by buying and holding PINS for the next 5 years, you will be beating the market average return of 7%. Dont worry about more drops and gave cash ready to scoop up higher year over year returns should the shorts push PINS into the 40s."
nice dip buy at 54! Winning!
EOY target $85. 5yr target $300. 40% revenue growth till 2026 with 15 P/S gives us $300+. ARPU is key to these assumptions.
"Pretty good support on a bearish day, who is still holding ???"
Sweet Jesus I never thought I’d see below $50 again I may have to buy back in I sold at $80! $PINS
"Even on a green day, underperforming AGAIN!"
See you guys at 80. I have bought enough for now but will add more if we drop below 52... Happy Investing
"No support, going to 36 next. What a disaster!!!"
"dropped $3 yesterday, up under $1. to get back above $65, pins q3 better beat street estimates by huge margin or else shorts will take this down further. i kept saying to myself long term play 3 years plus but watching this dropped from $89 to below $50 can't help but a bit disappointed,"
"PINS chart is that of a company heavily in Debt, with declining revenues and losing $."
Low volume since the ER. Todays strong volume plus reversal could be the beginning of next ER run up
All I own is up big on strong volume. Except PINS. This weakness has become surreal.
One of the better buys as the market looks to renter perma bull mode
"Online shopping ads being pushed for marketing? I been using PINS for exploring items and purchasing for a while now, I thought these ads already existed. Hence, the beauty and power of Pinterest and why it is going to shoot to the moon in years to come."
Better buy under 40
See you later!!!!
"Its comical to see people post daily about one stocks fluctuation! Buy, hold and relax. Worked for Buffet! If you can't take the short term ups and downs for long term growth then get out of the market!"
Do i have to remind people this was 84 in April???
Looking forward to the next earnings call
Why isn’t there any buyers?? I don’t understand the rationale behind not buying at price!
"This stock is killing me! I keep thinking we've hit the bottom, but keeps dropping."
$45 shall we? Ron
I have 13 stocks on my watchlist. Only pins is red.
$WOOF $UPWK $PINS can't trust this anymore!
"""We have a lot of confidence that the arc of monetization is steep growth, and we have a huge degree of confidence that if it executes, the profits will be enormous, because the margins are so high,”"
What exactly happened in order for this stock to go down this much ?
user growth is slowing a problem they can't fix
boom.
Way too cheap
if face buys pins and integrates it into facebook then we see huge growth
$57+ prior to next ER
Shorts?
I am shocked it's so high ! I just may be wrong about $40 but I'm still going to wait
Shorts on PINS and needles today 
"at the end of today market, if not turn into green , will sell out all ."
Let’s make this start of the uptrend into what will be awesome earnings report!!!
"A-l-m-o-s-t 5M shares traded 2 hours in at 11:30am. Longs want to see volume surpass 10M today, and a HOD closing price. I've been looking for this day for a while now. And it came at the very last second, chart-wise."
"In my opinion, $PINS looks like a very attractive valuation at the moment. $SNAP has a $120B market cap and $PINS has a $33B market cap. I know which one I prefer."
Had a good investor sold 1000 pins after it lost $11 off It's high (wise investor) and on the same day bought 280 shares of MSFT today they would be up 10k plus dividends ! long term investing and the fear of selling is what the people who get wealthy in this game want you to do ! PLAY THE GAME. As they say : You never lose $ making money !
"Bought some at 54.20. Looking to do another 50 shares next Friday. However, one thing has me worried as of yesterday. 4 executives sold off a combined ~$7million in shares all at the same time. Typically I take insider selling/buying with a grain of salt. But when the CFO unloads and 3 of his collegues at the same time, it has me guessing whether to buy more shares next Friday. Take it as you will, this is just my observation/concern. I'm bullish with pins long term, and will hold for 5-8years. I'm just debating whether to buy more share pre or post earnings."
Zach’s has it a #1 rating. I’m positive!
"The Market just gobbled up so many short stop losses this morning. You shorts are going to have to do alot better because it's clear that 54 is a STRONG level of support. Even if your able to break through it, Smart money will be adding for long term positions."
What's up with the p/e ratio?
How long until back to 70's........... This is chinese torture......... and we don't like it a bit.......
I agree with you all that are buying at these levels. You are going to clean up!!
There's a gap from Friday around $54.50 needs to fill. This is a decent % move higher but the volume isn't healthy. Hopefully that changes this afternoon.
Going to $60++++++
Get ready for the Ride to $70+ im all in
One would think the market would bid up PINS since more Covid should mean more MAUs. I think is just the case where one has to just stick with the original thesis and hold on until the monetization increases until it becomes more important. FB had the same issue. At some point their users topped out. It was not until they could show monetization did the stock recover from the mid $20s.
I bought 100 shares at 11 and 100 at 25 sold 100 at 25 and got my initial investment back plus some and now can hold the 11 a share for long term.
PINS could drop to 40 short term . But it is a 200 stock after few years
Glad to have exited out of this stock months ago. Goes up at same pace as the market on good days and drops 2x - 3x the market on down days.
"There’s Tik Tok videos going around with creators praising PINS. Creators and small business owners are getting 500x the views and engagement than FB, Insta, Twitter, Tik Tok… this is huge potential for reach. And they’re nit even sponsored posts!!"
Pinterest is doing two things now to make money.Ads and selling goods on there platform
Still too expensive at this price
"Keep going, can’t wait for the big jump in October "
pins this level almost the easiest money I can make.
Pay day Thursday. Adding more to my core. Love these prices.
Wish this was my entry point! What a sale. Super bullish - question is if it’s going to rally before earnings. 
"I don't know who is manipulating this, but it sure looks like it to me. Great  numbers, and stock falls, make no sense to a common sense thinker!"
$60+++++ this week
I told you guys this will fall below $50
"I am loading and loading, two scenarios for me in 5y: I buy a new expensive car or I’ll sell my current cheap car, pay the debts and take the public transports"
"Pinterest extended its shopping features for both merchants and Pinners to seven more countries Wednesday: Austria, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland."
this is way overdone. it'll be up eventually. be patient and buy more.
Going to $60++++
"To buy ore not to buy… For real! Help me! Give me a reason to buy! I did my DD and research but I can’t make up my mind…. So, you tell me."
In at 53.50  Lfg!
Not a great finish to the day yesterday but hopefully we can start a nice run up to 60 next week!
"Long on Pins, but I’m curious: What is Pins doing to advertise themselves? Do they just take for granted that people will stumble across them? I don’t seem to come across any main stream ads for them (but maybe that’s just me?). Considering the market’s response to their MAU numbers last earnings, shouldn’t they be advertising themselves more?"
After hours - is it really down $3 ???????
Pushed down on low volume again.Some Big House must have a large short going here
Until they figure out how to get users to the site every day and not just the days they're trying to choose a paint color this stock will remain stagnant !
The begining of the climb heading toward next earnings like does evrytime....
I sold Facebook and just started buying PINS.
lets talk about under $50 next week!
what? 35billion market cap for 2b revenue?
Red by EOD
"I don't listen to analysts ""downgrades"" because I didn't see an analyst tell me to buy it until after I doubled my money."
"Almost there, be patient $40 is almost there !"
Pay day today. I have added to my position. Been adding since it dropped below 60. See you guys at 80 then 100.
 Facebook
Still holding from $15. Just hold folks.
"For its second quarter overall, Pinterest reported adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share on revenue of $613 million. Analysts expected Pinterest to report earnings of 13 cents a share on revenue of $562.2 million"
"lol check out the volume of calls all the way up to 80 . like 90,000 . so can you figure out why this is getting shorted so much."
i think the gap will fill before earnings and earnings will determine the price from there.
Remember microsoft was looking at pinterest
"Man, I'm really loading up. Payday Thursday I will keep adding at these 50 levels. Long and Strong. Better than putting it in a savings account. PINS isn't going anywhere and only direction over next few years is up"
Let me ask all the stock geniuses out there a ? Why does pins trade hand and hand with snap on down days but never on higher days?
"Why I like to be on the short side of pins trade? Simple, the price of 35 Billion dollars is too expensive."
"Haven't seen any official announcement, but previous Q3 earnings were released the last week of October. So y'all got about 2 weeks to get on board before the rocket ship takes off again :)"
I hope you have been adding like me
Let’s get some positive momentum so we can close the gap down
Where are all my short friends that preach fire and brimstone
"Like I said before, PINS will continue to slide downward, under $50 later. This is really just a photo album like Photobucket, but with half the potential market size."
"Patience patience, only time will bring Rev growth into stock growth."
"Last 2 intraday lows on 9/21/21 and 9/22 were $51.35. Today it got down to $51.05 (so far), but again bounced from there some. Roughly that's the defense line. Hasn't had a washout day, but we shall see. $50.70 gap from last October 28. With earnings coming up right around then again. Long term buy, short term who knows?"
$55+ this week 
"Based on 17 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Pinterest in the last 3 months. The average price target is $70.87 with a high forecast of $85.00 and a low forecast of $57.00. The average price target represents a 29.40% change from the last price of $54.77.Seems like a no brainer to me.Or we can listen to the shorts, the doubters and that one buddy who keeps telling you to put it all in crypto?"
$NIO SOLD this at $47ish$PINS sold it at $78 $LI sold at $31.5 sold those around July 7
"Remember PINS turned down Microsoft’s offer to buy it , and they didn’t flinch or counter the offer, I’m long on pins and dips"
Added at 49.5. I think this is bac to 60+ by end of year.
think this is the time to add. got to be bottom and will prob shoot up with earnings coming.
today they just clean out those call options. That is why never buy call options just because it was up
the good thing all tho. is the volume on the put have been getting high and most of the calls are deep out of the money. so it's got room for some up movement to clap the puts
"There is no Buying interest. PINS is not going to be given the benefit of the doubt. IDK why that is. When the stock hit $80 in July I thought it was setting up to take the Earnings news at the highs, and was going higher on what I thought would be an excellent Quarter and Guidance. Rarely is anyone as WRONG as I was there. Not that the Quarter's results were Poor, they were very good if not excellent. But I never saw the EXTREME reaction by the Market to the small decline in User growth. Pinterest management is going to have to PROVE Revenue/Earnings growth and I now believe prove it in SPADES. I am LONG since February 2020 and expect to still be so in February 2022. Forget the ballpark, management needs to hit it out of the stadium, to entice Institutional $ to Accumulate."
Whats happening AH?
"Bought more today at $51.54, and last Monday $50.44. Adding to position from $21s last year. Seems like a decent value (hard to believe) here."
EVERYONE BUY SKLZ NOW! SKLZ will JUMP by 400% back above $40 in a few weeks!SKLZ is the next MAJOR ROCKET!$SAP $PINS $ZM
"I'm just not buying this falls below $51 and Breaks-down on volume into the $40's. Earnings is too close and last Q's results were too stellar. Yes, ""stellar"". In almost every measurable way, excepting 'maintaining User growth at a rate commensurate with global pandemic lockdowns'. Go Short or Sell for THAT reason?!? Screw that. I also think it's more likely PINS climbs into Earnings and then Sells the news, than collapsing from here PRIOR to Earnings. I'm pricing Call Options tonite, both pre- and post-Earnings, including Leaps."
Stronger than expected retail sales should be good for PINS.
Here we go!
One gap closed at $50.70 from 10/28/20. Yowza.
as expected.35$ by the summer 2022
"Love the shorts narrative. Fire and brimstone. I will catch a falling knife all day for solid company and PINS is on that list. I don't care if I but now or at 49, 48, 47. All I know is where it will be in 12+ months and that is alot higher than we are now. Happy Investing"
grabbed a few shares today...
Mfst needs to bid $85 for this stock.
I think this is a must buy!
$Fubo $pins $pltr $nio these stock want climb back to their glory but they forgot even with today price it was already up over 100% from sept 2020 !!
"Personally, I feel like the current price is good value for investing. At the current price and projected future revenue, this should be an easy 15-20% return for the next 1-2 years minimum. Any further drops in price are just higher percentage returns for long-term growth. Be ready to scoop up any further presents in price drops."
"I'm not a technical trader, but there are just so many gaps last year in play. Today's low of $51.46 (so far, 9/21/21) took out yesterday's low of $51.56. Which took out the earnings report low of $51.95 on 8/19/21.There are gaps at $50.70 from 10/28/20, and that's very close to closing. Then on 10/20/20 there's a gap from $46.19 to $49.40. And even one on 9/22/20 from $37-$37.41. A small one. At that level it's trading at a little over 23x next year's high estimate, which I think PINS will blow out of the water. For this kind of earnings growth that would seem ludicrous.I first got in last year at $21, and was regretting selling some on the way up. I added in $60s and $55. I'd add more but now I want to wait to see if some of these gaps fill. Long term I think this is a great level to add, but market itself is shaky (rolling correction) and PINS has been weak as a kitten for weeks now."
Only thing green in my portfolio
"This how I see this…$45 after snap reports…after PINS report, it will drop to $35 range and that’s where I will take a position. Simple! Don’t make invest complicated."
If pinterest finds a way to increase user engagement this will skyrocket
Two and three dollar days are back 
literally the same exact chart every single day.
even the corrupt analysts lowet target is 57. still no buyer. just amazing.
"The Question here is this: how much in Revenue, ARPU and EPS does Pinterest have to report, to have the Market go from Selling the stock due to User decline, to Buying it due to Earnings Growth?"
"Holding a stock for YEARS is NOT easy. On the contrary. Even without nasty sell-offs like the last 8 weeks it's still brutally hard. So easy to push that button and collect your gains. In large part because sometimes, that's the smart thing to do. Not always. But sometimes. But it's not the right thing to do here with PINS. Because very soon, it will become apparent that there is no better platform in the World, to spend your advertising dollars. Facebook has peaked and has already begun it's descent. Pinterest is only going to take more and more of that e-commerce advertising pie with each passing year. So patience yeah it's a TOUGH gig. But PINS will be $100, $150, $200 per share. NOT tomorrow. But in due time. And then your complaint will be, 'why didn't I buy more shares when it was n double-digits?' lol."
Pins needs better promotion it's not just for women. look up anything A to Z. The app sign up could be more welcoming. long term positive
I'm invested and holding. Hopefully it will not break the $50 and will go up to $60 in the next 2 weeks.Q3 earnings will be published in october.
"Can’t wait to see the next earnings ..., to the moooooooooooon"
I am so tired of seeing red every single day on incredibly low volume.
"Market down, this is up. I’ll take it. Things bode well, especially long term."
Love this ride. I’ll wait till 75 before I sell a single share. Holding strong and long 
"Idk PINS seems very very undervalued atm, even affirm has same market cap…Pinterest brand name alone is worth 100 billion in my opinion"
added more
"Thank you for the cheap shares again!!!! See you again, next Thursday"
This is a good stock to own for years.Very low debt level and awesome revenue growth.
i like this chart
Great day so far today but Don’t expect tomorrow to be so kind
Well shorts are back preaching fire and brimstone. Buying more. Under 60 is a gift
I have never been more certain that this is the bottom. Buy and Hold long.We won’t see below 50 only if the world collapses.
Earnings in 3 weeks!
$ROKU $PINS $FVRR $zm $PTON too expensive ! lets it drop another 50%
"Guys, really don't recommend this stock.You have 50% chance to get a 10% gainand 50% chance to loose 30%"
Where’s the love for Pinterest?
Added another 10 shares today. Up to 60 shares total in my humble stack.
Green is feeling good
Buy back at $40.00 ! leave the insiders holding the bag !
It is unbelievable that the stock is too weak. Every other tech stocks recovered immediately but this still struggles. I am really afraid of the reaction after the next earning call. I hope we will see good days but doesn't seem so.
Hoping for a pop up before earnings 
This should trade around $150+ by 2023
"From MF article, this is what you're Holding with PINS: ""In fact, I think Pinterest is building the commerce platform of tomorrow. Consider this: Let's say you search Pinterest for ""summer fashion,"" and you find a shirt you like; Pinterest can help you find out where to buy it. And later this year, the company will debut on-platform transactions, meaning you'll be able to purchase that shirt directly through Pinterest. But that only scratches the surface of what this platform could be.Going back to your search results, let's say you notice the denim model is wearing nice shoes. You can actually zoom in on the shoes, and Pinterest will use its AI engine to find the product (and visually similar items). Now you can buy those shoes, or something similar, even if you don't know the brand. Better yet, let's say you see someone wearing the shoes in real life (or elsewhere on the internet); you can snap a picture with your smartphone, or otherwise upload that image to Pinterest, and get the same result.Now, imagine the potential of blending Pinterest with augmented reality (AR) glasses in the future. Wherever you go, whatever you see, it would all be shoppable.""If Pinterest becomes an online destination to both shop AND PURCHASE, it will rival Amazon, and PINS will rival AMZN. Certainly a far lesser rival. But rival just the same."
"Ok only .25 per share in Earnings. But they JUST became profitable and are growing ARPU strongly. $2B in business, $2B in Cash, 0 Debt, throwing off over $300M in FCF. Over 79% of the Float owned by Institutions. The weakness since the last Earnings is non-sensical and is becoming more strange the longer it goes on. If Pinterest has a truly weak Earnings Report in November in terms of business performance, NOT USER GROWTH, then I'll admit I was wrong and the market was right. If they build on last Q's performance then there must be some Reckoning with the share price here. Typically, companys' stocks do not sell off continuously as their business grows and becomes more and more profitable.

"loaded up again yesterday. this is too predictable-take advantage of the price manipulation people. This will run up into first quarter 2022. Way oversold-anytime you can load up under $60, do it!!"
"Profitable, Billions in cash, No Debt, and growing. Just added another 500 shares."
Great pre-market start!!
finally..... The (PIN)FORCE awakens.We will see $60 in the next week!
"Jackaszs joe's covid plan is imminent. It will not include Lockdowns. But it's September. Still Summer. It's possible that going into the Winter months of December-January-February, we start to hear of Lockdowns being at least considered. If that does happen, even on just the conjecture, it will boost stocks likely to benefit from those Lockdowns, and PINS will be one of them."
Some big buys taking it green there. String finish to close the week would be appreciated.
Unbelievable red in a big rallying day
I am loading and loading but loosing everything  Are you guys so sure it will go up?
"This company is doing well. The future fears are being overplayed. Some analyst wants to make sure that PINS is punished for providing good sold grown because some analyst wanted exponential growth. Other analysts aren't even thinking about growth or financials or anything else that matters, they're just sticking with the herd. I don't see any event that will change their minds and that hurts my PF...given that all good news is deliberately ignored because it isn't exponential growth, how can there be an upside? Can anyone identify an event, other than exponential growth, that will cause a turnaround?"
"10MA crossed the 20MA, MACD bullish, and RSI still relatively oversold. This should bounce very soon."
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
$52+ EOD would be glorious
This is being played by MMs and hedge funds.

It?s so fing hard to hold on to this #$%$!!!!!

"This weekend I searched and shopped for Halloween customs, party, and food ideas for my party in 2 weeks. Simple and Easy on Pinterest!"
FB turnoff will be gains for PINS
Payday Thursday. I will be adding another 500 shares
"Just a reminder. This was the Earnings Performance that PINS has got crushed and continues to be weak on:""Pinterest PINS reported second-quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 92.3%. The company had reported non-GAAP loss of 7 cents per share in the year-ago period.Revenues skyrocketed 125.4% year over year to $613 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3%.Revenues from the United States increased 106.9% year over year to $480 million. Meanwhile, international revenues soared 224.4% year over year to $133 million.User Base & Advertising Business DetailsMonthly active users (MAUs) increased 9% from the prior-year quarter to 454 million globally. Growth was slower than anticipated growth in mid-teens in the second quarter primarily due to the widespread easing of pandemic restrictions.While United States MAUs decreased 5% to 91 million, International MAUs grew 13% from the year-ago quarter to 363 million.Global average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 89% from a year ago to $1.32 driven by an increase in advertising demand on the platform.While ARPU in the United States increased 103% year over year to $5.08, International ARPU surged 163% to 36 cents."""
Wow seriously I’m starting to feel sorry for all the longs...when was the last time this had a green day?
