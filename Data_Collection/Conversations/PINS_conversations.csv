Boys I could get this stock to go higher if you want...all I would need to do is open a short position. Always seems to make things go higher :)
"Cathy Woods bought 150,000 shares Friday. The sell side was overdone."
why AH sell-off? Insiders info leaked?
Well I've been adding weekly. Added another discount buy. I will be more than happy to by in the 40's more shares for me. This goes to my retirement fund so all the better but I'm shocked how low the price has gone. I think investors have no clue the gold mine this platform is worth. I sold early on FB not doing the same with PINS.
PINS--I like the stock long term --short term watch out
Back to the $70s
Microsoft wanted to buy for a REASON!! HUGE POTENTIAL!
"PINS is a great buy here. MAUs dropped as the pandemic subsided, but not unexpectedly as the company predicted this. Revenue per user was unexpectedly high and will continue to improve. This is my favorite stock in my portfolio right now as I expect the share price to at least double in the next couple of years. Bought 2023 calls, which I don't do unless my confidence is really high."
Will Microsoft buyout be announced Monday?I’m thinking $148 is fair
$PINS will probably dip under $50 before it skyrockets back up past $70. Patience will be the big winner. GLTA!
"This dip can stop now, I’m down 20k"
Upgraded to “Strong Buy” and PT of $152 by ZeroCool.
Recommend not buying yet and wait for further weakness. Buy shares before end or week. A good entry below 55. Jmho
Hope this will go up
I’m going to keep adding on every dip
"Way overdone, profitable and high growth, what do you want"
PINS BABY. It’s a unique platform with solid fundamentals and is even turning a profit! A growth stock trading at roughly 17x sales. Pretty solid opportunity I think.
this stock could easily go back to 90$ plus it's way oversold right at the moment
"LOL when I was on the side line for PINS, it goes down few Pennie or recovers really quick…now that I bought in a huge position, it goes down by dollars…I live the stock market"
"I added 500 PINS shares today, I followed Cathie Wood’s move. I think , she’s right."
Here we go
"Can’t wait to see the next earnings ..., to the moooooooooooon"
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.
Still holding from $15. Just hold folks.
Far from a site that people will go on everyday ; if you really think it is then you're fooling yourself and attempting to convince people to buy so as to boost the price of shares that you bought much higher !
$ZM $PTON earning get dump again just like every other work from home stocks. $FVRR $UPWK $PINS $ETSY
"Folks, give PINS a few more days or maybe even a few weeks to consolidate. Short-time, stock prices are pretty random and trade mostly based on emotions. Long-term, there is a 100% correlation between the stock price and the success of the company. But I'm sure all of you already know this, but it's still worth repeating.So if you don't think PINS will go bankrupt soon and has a successful business model, then this is a fine opportunity to add more shares, which I've been doing since last Friday. When the stock was trading at 75 prior to earning, I was jittery. Now, I feel very good about accumulating more shares at the current price. Cheers, everyone..."
$200-$300 is the 5 year target. Buy @$50/$40 really makes no difference. Can't time the market.
"From recent MF article:""Looking at MAUs in more detail, Pinterest lost 24 million MAUs in its fiscal Q2 from Q1. What made it worse was in those totals, 7 million MAUs were lost from the U.S. Why is that important? Users from the U.S. bring in multiples more in revenue compared to international users. Indeed, the U.S.'s average revenue per user (ARPU) was $5.08 in the most recent quarter, compared to $0.36 internationally. Therefore, losing one user from the U.S. is equivalent to losing 14 million internationally. Expanding on the thought further, MAUs from the U.S. brought in an ARPU of $18.86 over the last four quarters. So if you multiply that over the 7 million MAUs it lost, it highlights a potential loss of $133 million in annual revenue for Pinterest. That's a meaningful loss considering the company earned $1.7 billion in revenue in 2020. Understandably, the stock would sell off after that kind of news. However, there was one statement in the company's shareholder letter that may indicate the loss is not as bad as it looks on the surface:Virtually all of the difference between our Q2 MAU guidance and our actual Q2 MAUs is attributable to a decline in MAUs who use Pinterest on the web. These users have tended to be less engaged and generate less revenue than Pinners who visited our mobile apps directly. In Q2, MAUs on our mobile apps grew in the U.S. year over year, and grew by more than 20% internationally.In other words, the company lost lower-value MAUs in the U.S. in the most recent quarter and actually increased higher-value MAUs in the U.S. That statement could mean that the overall loss in users may not have as significant of an impact on revenue as investors may think. What this could mean for investors Other than the reported MAU losses in the U.S., Pinterest presented a fantastic quarter. Revenue increased by 125% from the year before, and management guided for 40% year-over-year growth in the next quarter. In addition, the company turned the corner on profitability as net income was $69 million, after losing $101 million the year before."""
"Growth stocks have been getting punished hard for softer guidance/expectations (let alone misses on estimates). $ZM and $PINS = latest examples Given $PCT has no revenue, negative income and won't have output at its first plant until late-2022, what drives the stock price from now until 2023?"
Just hold. You’ll be fine.
"The obvious bounce back off the big support at $55 (which it obviously didn't hit). It was too obvious support at $55 would hold so buyers came in early. Back to $65 plus this month easily. The drop was a total overreaction, I was blown away by their earnings."
"Can’t hold its gain, can’t wait to dump it"
Looks like another week of buying for me. Thursday can't get here fast enough!
Wake me up when wall st decides to stop manipulation
Lets move about $60 after the fed meeting shows that delta will push out the plan to lower QE..
Go Pins!!!!!
"The good news here is that revenue is still soaring because average revenue per user in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past year. With some unfortunate signs that we're not entirely over the pandemic, we could see a one-two boost where Pinterest usage picks up again with the company's improved monetization skills in place."
"We are in a downward channel right now, these tend to break upward. It’s just a matter of finding the bottom"
"It didn’t even drop this hard for yesterday sell off, but it’s crashing today when market is doing fine….as soon as I buy!"
"65,00$ tomorow morning say cathy...;)"
i bought the dip at 56... but didnt know there is a bigger cheese dip lol... but im not selling... no way... this is a no brainer at a nice discount... it has good support at this line... if it woukd reach the 50 ill just buy some more!
Red because ^TNX is green. Long term investors no need to worry. $300 target 3-5 years.
This thing should have been at 100 already...but if I sell I know it will be 100 after next earnings....
I'm still holding to the stock as I believe it is going for a BIG show tomorrow
"loaded up again yesterday. this is too predictable-take advantage of the price manipulation people. This will run up into first quarter 2022. Way oversold-anytime you can load up under $60, do it!!"
Thought for the day:pins could get cut in half from here and still be trading at 114 times earnings.
Pay day today. I have added to my position. Been adding since it dropped below 60. See you guys at 80 then 100.
With Covid on the surge the stay at home stocks will surge again next quarter! Users will go up in fall/winter as normal plus Covid surge will result in big growth for pins!
bounce back easy money..
Great buying opportunity. Buy Hold. Be Happy.
As all Pins longs would love to see a sustainable pop but if you look at all of the big guys that blew away earnjngs almost all had a reason or comment to drag them back down. Hopefully Pins can beat and hold at least $75-$80. With so many people trading for pennies the swings are wild around earnings. Ben needs to learn when and what to say and that he can kill Pins with a small slip of his words. Go long as Pins will be huge in the next 5 years with growth to 100's of new countries and eventually with E Commerce opportunities. $250 in 3 years just hold and buy dips.
Keep buying on this dip!!
"The only problem PINS faces (they’re not the only stock by the way), is despite the fact the company is growing, the valuation is still insanely high. PINS could fall another 40% and still have a high valuation. So the stock is technically still very expensive even at these levels. HOWEVER, in context of the entire market, unless rates start rising they should recover from this price. If their users keeps declining, look out below. But even if it continued to fall eventually it becomes a steal. buying now is a good price but anything 45 and below is an absolute steal, long as interest rates don’t move and users stop falling. And people crying because it’s down another 2%+ today, you don’t have the stomach for investing, at all, and you need to be sticking with index funds"
My average share cost is $77. Let’s keep this train chugging along uphill!!
EOY target $85. 5yr target $300. 40% revenue growth till 2026 with 15 P/S gives us $300+. ARPU is key to these assumptions.
60-65 by end of September
"Don’t panic guys.. whatever goes down will come up! The entry price is very attractive, any good news from the company will send this stock to the moon!! Really nothing to worry about.. strong earnings, future ready firm, just need to wait and it will hit $70 easily"
PINS now has a pay per click search engine now. that's what's gonna make it rocket. you can search & purchase things from the Pinterest app
Download the app… lets get the user base up
if face buys pins and integrates it into facebook then we see huge growth
This thing only moves down huh? I need it to pop soon
Love my Pins!
Average analyst 1yr price target offering 36% gains. Hold for 3-5 years you're looking at 300%+
I’m not selling a single share. Buy when everyone is afraid
This is worth more then 60.
Come on Pins!!!You can do it!!!
OVERSOLD.
Holding until $100
dead cat
"I am not a T/A trader, but it seems like targets to watch are the $53.94 May 13, 2021 low. It closed over $55 that day so seems like solid support. However, there's the gap up on October 29, 2020. It opened at $64 that day. The October 28 close was $49.25 and the high was $50.02. The lowest it has been since is $52.06 on November 10, 2020. Hard to believe, but gaps tend to close. I added yesterday, but may get another leg down and chance to add more."
"I use Pintrest everyday. I know lots of women who used it to plan their weddings. It’s a great way to save recipes. Home decor, fashion etc. I love it!"
"Great time to add to your Long positions here folks. If you can just stop watching the price daily and come back in 3 years, you will likely be rewarded"
I just can’t believe this. How much more bleeding. It’s killing me.
Where are all the bashers? Option calls couldn't get better!
Still holding from buying at $15. Not selling until triple digits minimum.
Do you guys buy stocks and expect them to gain 30% immediately? Amateurs. These things take quarters/years to mature.
Did everyone just turn direction to SNAP? Why? PINS is apparently over punished by the market even the revenue growth is better than SNAP and share price currently still undervalue! Some headwinds from reopening but I think just transitory. Still believe in this stock
Pay day tomorrow! Buying more!!!!!
I see lots of ads on the mobile app..$$$$
wow market is exploding and pins is imploding. So not cool.
"Just like Longs need to be mindful of lower gaps, Shorts need to be mindful of higher ones. And that massive gap up to $72 is staring you right in the face. With Pinterests growth, Balance sheet, Cash, and 400,000,000 MAUs, I know filling that gap to $72 isn't a question of 'if' but 'when'. IDK exactly how long it will take to fill it. I just know that it's going to and I'm going to make $ on it. Meanwhile I have a 1pm tee-time."
This drop for PINS is just wrong. Yes their users are down 5% but their existing users are spending twice as much. I dont get it. There really is a lot that do not do their DD.
I think Microsoft will buy us
added some to long portfolio . at this price was one of the easiest decisions in a while.
"Don't get the weakness here. My APPS popped today because its getting added to the S&P400. But before that it was unreasonably weak like my PINS. Pinterest showed they are growing ARPU very strongly. They lost some home-users post covid shut-down and but increased more engaged phone-users. 5G e-commerce via cell-phone is the tidal wave of future revenues heading this way. Already doing over $2B in business and growing, now profitable and growing too. Forget the weakness, how is PINS not being given a hyper-multiple for it's strong growth and Cash Flow? It's FCF is $338M. PINS should be a Cashcow Rocketship. Instead it just sits there on the Launchpad rusting. I don't get it."
Heavy discount prices
The turnaround will be nice
Over 60
"Why do you invest in PINS? I do because their AI is incredible, it’s that simple."
"nice reversal , had to go long ....."
Loaded at 58.2...waiting for the spike
Added more. Not as much as yesterday but every share counts!
"This is just like yesterday, we will end strong well over 60. Mark my words!"
"100 billion market cap, short term 1-2 years out"
Love the shorts. Microsoft offered to buy PINS for 85BIL?????? Follow the big money and understand what you own. Thanks weak hands for giving me a chance to accumulate at bottom prices. Double up coming
ok so i have a few shares at this nice dip-discount... now i am considering to go 3 years long... it could be the next facebook at 300 a piece....
"Company grew over 100% this time last year! No debt and over 1 billion in cash! Thank you for another bottom purchase. Obviously investors have no clue what to do with Pinterest, which is good for me because I know. Hahahahah"
"Funny when the stock price went down hard, lots of Motley Fool articles came up supporting the ""Why"" and why it should go down further. Now there are tons of Fools articles supporting why it should come back up."
Already up big on this dip!!! Thank you again from a long time investor.
"It never ceases to amaze me the amount of belly aching that I see here because the stock didn't meet their expectations. No one is forcing you to buy PINS! You obviously feel that the stock has potential, why else would you be interested in it? If you feel like you know better prospects why don't you move on? Guess what? Stocks go up and yes, stocks go down... Surprise surprise! If you don't see the potential that this stock has, move on!"
Dont understand this downward movement! Its soo oversold
"Buy the dip, will go up."
"Man, I'm really loading up. Payday Thursday I will keep adding at these 50 levels. Long and Strong. Better than putting it in a savings account. PINS isn't going anywhere and only direction over next few years is up"
"Is there any chance that Pinterest will be included in the S&P 500? It has been making good money for the fourth quarter in a row, has a sufficiently large market cap...In 2018 twtr joined in s&p 500 2018 twtr was smalller than 2021 pins ........"
"this was so great, i wanted ""pins"" for a long time but the price was always too high for me but now i got some shares at such a low price... gonne hold for at least a few monthes or a year..."
Worth atleast 70.
Dips like these have happened at least 3 times this year. And what happened every time? Look at the chart. Fundamentals cannot be better. Apply patience to the equation and you get a winner. Ignore the noise
"i had a big buy in 56, but this price is attractive, i think ill add a bit more...rsi indicates oversold"
Meh all I know is PINS will be 70+ by October
V shape recovery in the next couple days .. still a strong growth coming
Come on 55
Payday has arrived. Perfect day for buying. More it drops more I buy. Long and strong
"Added at $56.36. Still holding some from $21 last year, having sold some along the way. A market correction and I'll likely be adding lower, but this'll probably be a fine entry longer term."
"From MF article, this is what you're Holding with PINS: ""In fact, I think Pinterest is building the commerce platform of tomorrow. Consider this: Let's say you search Pinterest for ""summer fashion,"" and you find a shirt you like; Pinterest can help you find out where to buy it. And later this year, the company will debut on-platform transactions, meaning you'll be able to purchase that shirt directly through Pinterest. But that only scratches the surface of what this platform could be.Going back to your search results, let's say you notice the denim model is wearing nice shoes. You can actually zoom in on the shoes, and Pinterest will use its AI engine to find the product (and visually similar items). Now you can buy those shoes, or something similar, even if you don't know the brand. Better yet, let's say you see someone wearing the shoes in real life (or elsewhere on the internet); you can snap a picture with your smartphone, or otherwise upload that image to Pinterest, and get the same result.Now, imagine the potential of blending Pinterest with augmented reality (AR) glasses in the future. Wherever you go, whatever you see, it would all be shoppable.""If Pinterest becomes an online destination to both shop AND PURCHASE, it will rival Amazon, and PINS will rival AMZN. Certainly a far lesser rival. But rival just the same."
it is a nice opportunity !
I'm the only one that feels extremely Bullish at these prices?>
"Today was one of those days when you can see how institutions have purchased stocks from panic sellers.With quality enterprises, patience is the path to a wealthier life."
i ended up buying 500 shares at 57.19
"I own 1000 shares , looking to add more on the dip.PINS has free cash flow and very little debt. No worry, long term is good."
"all shorts and dumpers should know...i bought in the low 50... great oppertunity... im not selling in the near future, and im not alone... pins is gonne boom this year!!!"
My Jan and Feb 60-70 calls are already up 50% lmao.Love Becky stocks!
"We are in buy territory folks - RSI indicator suggests oversold, only lost 5 million active users Quarter to Quarter, revenue increasing, this is a safe bet to recover regardless of what the market does"
"41% drop after good earnings. Yeah, well, there is no manipulation."
Let’s touch $65 today 
"Has there ever been a Gap more certain to fill than the one on PINS' chart at $72? September, October, November, December, January? Does it matter? The more I look at it, the more I see opportunity."
think my initial buy at 55 last week will pay dividends...Nice few days action for an oversold stock. onwards to 60+
It's not the question if Pins will recover. It is when. As long as we keep shares for an year this should be fine. The growth continues and management finds new ways to increase revenues.
Great buy at these prices
Will this little guy ever see the sky again?
We love green days. Cheers ladies and gentlemen.
Payday tomorrow! Guess what I'm buying!!!! PINS
Pins has started to climb up a little birdy told me …
Volume will pick up around noon. Load up now or miss the train to 60+
Cathie Wood ARK Invest bought into PINS for a bargain. She’s bullish on tech ..
RIP market. Looks like recovery will take long time.
Bought 500 shares. Let's GO!!
Really enough already!!!!!
Buy buy buy
Zach I follow a large trader on twtr is that u ?
cant hold this down forever
The marketcap is only 37 billion. Way undervalued.
"it really wants to go up- today market was not favorable, will see tomorrow 6% upward movement"
"Alright guys, I'm out. .OUT OF MONEY FROM BUYING THE DIPS!!!!"
"If you check similarwebs, visit to pinterest actually stabilizes and rebounds in July. Yet Wall St couldnt care less and still greedily short the stock. All we can do is to swallow this pain and wait it gradually rebound."
Any good news will send this stock to the 70s.
Triple top pattern for anyone look it up. I actually super regret not sell all my stock on feb 18 when I realized my portfolio have triple top pattern lol . It was an indication of bearish..
"To buy ore not to buy… For real! Help me! Give me a reason to buy! I did my DD and research but I can’t make up my mind…. So, you tell me."
"Slowly accumulating here, should be a good growth story once pandemic-related growth slowdown is over. STMP suffered from similar situation for 2 qtrs, then it got bought at a big premium."
PINS going to $70+ later this year. Not even sweating it and picked up some more at $60. I'll pick up more if it heads to $50 but I don't think I'll be that lucky.
Hopefully tomorrow will be the comeback
LETS GOOOOO
"If you don’t believe this is an overreaction, then just look at Nikola their ex-CEO got indicted today for fraud (the prosecution said he lied about every aspect of the business to pump the stock) and it still is down only 15% compared to Pinterest’s 20%."
"Ah, the magical $60 was back."
Can’t wait to buy things directly through the app. So much potential and still attractively cheap
Sign of strength here.
"Fundamentally, Pinterest has positive cash flow and very very low in debt.It’s a good company to invest in for the long term, if you don’t need the money right away."
"Impressive revenue growth, no debt, nice margins, cash flow positive. Kind of a no brainer at this price, is it not?"
"easy 20% gain from here to many nervous nellies and dbag traders on this board. Pins is a great company look at the numbers, just couldn't lap the covid bump. New investors just sit tight it will recover within 60 days, traders just here to bash due to selling puts its that simple.Pins will be a huge E Commerce company in due time. Their financial numbers were off the charts positive in every aspect...Go long"
"Solid financials, great long term play. You can buy now, or try and time the market. Either way this will be a great investment in 3-5 years."
just remember MSFT wanted to buy PINS out at $85 a share. PINS said no for a reason
Hell bring it to the 40's. Stop teasing with the 52. I have been adding adding since 58. Cheaper price more shares. in 3 to 5 years this is a 200+ stock. Print IT
"Market down, this is up. I’ll take it. Things bode well, especially long term."
"New article: Pinterest: $100+ To Come, Buy The Dip......"
Chance to recover to 70 next week ? Or 62 tommorow
Closed 25% of my shorts from $58.
"In times like this you really have to detach and understand the value of what you own, I’m not going to tell you to buy and hold for 5-10 years. Trust me when I say in 3-6 months you will either be really happy or be phased you missed the opportunity."
That daily morning dump. Hard to not think this is being manipulated in some way
"Nice, I told you it will close 59+. Keep going!"
80s in 2 months again
Pins will bounce back.. the USA growth was slowing back in q2. International will be the start of the next growth cycle..but it will take some time.
I bought the dip
Heavy buyer here. Stock is down 40% from highs on a slight slow down in US MaU??? I think not. Stock will be a double in two years.
NO VOLUME AT ALL
"PINS fundamental is solid, it was due to panic selling and distracted by other earnings plus crypto yesterday. Once this start moving, this will rocket within 2-3 days of unstoppable surge! "
"20% shares shorted. I think with the level of interest, this can rebound back to $75 in no time. Buy this dip"
"Took out the YTD low of $53.94 on MAy 13. Next level is the $50.70 intraday high on 10/28/20 (it closed that day at $49.25), when it gapped up on earnings on 10/29/20, opening at $64."
"What seem like easy cheap puts, could turn into total losses."
"It’s a good sign we aren’t under 58, lol"
We are making a solid base for power hour today. I’m still predicting a push to 58 today
"I've never seen so many people so happy for a $3 bounce on a stock that fell $17 over 2 days, from a company who refused to issue 3rd quarter guidance . Amazing ."
Q2 revenue grew 125% year over year to $613 million. I repeat: Q2 revenue grew 125% year over year to $613 million. It's not just about maus!! It's about what they do with the users!!!
Pins made money with less users and beat on earnings.I think it’s a great idea not to show how many users they have for q3…maybe then everyone will just look at earnings….Does anyone agree?
56.61 and 56.94 are our breakout figures.
"FB AMZN PINS basically every stock other than SNAP have been down due to ""ReOpening"" go back 2 Quarters and you will see they are still up on average, this 18% drop is a buying opportunity, it will likely rebound to $64-$75 sooner or later"
"Why has Pinterest been trending down over the last few months, I thought it would hold up well in this market climate?"
"The continued selling due to an anomalous dip in overall MAU growth is ridiculous. PINS is on track for continued 40-50% annual revenue growth or greater for many years to come as mobile MAU's and monetization (both in ecommerce and advertising) continues to grow. There's a massive runway, absolutely massive."
Only down a few cents on a downgrade. That tells me the bottom is most likely in. Little reaction to “bad” news.
2 more hours then either we see mid $60 or $80. GL!
How low can you go?
Just added my weekly purchase. Thank You Shorts for driving the price down. I will look for continued bargain prices next week. Cheers!
"Thanks Powell, no one wanted to make profits anyway. Why not claiming tapering happening tomorrow so we can all sleep through this year."
"There’s Tik Tok videos going around with creators praising PINS. Creators and small business owners are getting 500x the views and engagement than FB, Insta, Twitter, Tik Tok… this is huge potential for reach. And they’re nit even sponsored posts!!"
Pins made money this quarter with less mau…..think about that
"It’s gonna test the bottom for a few days. I’ve seen this happening over and over again. Last time, there were lawsuits and in my opinion a more pessimistic sentiment. Hold, this should change soon"
Has anyone actually downloaded the pins app and use it?
At what price range would you say PINS is worth at right now?
$61 close - $64 open
Just loaded up on 2023 Calls. haven't seen this kind of opportunity in a while for $PINS. Calls are way undervalued at this point. Believe the same for $BB
"I use Pinterest all the time, love this App and what they provide for designers, renovation and other inspiration search. I keep it for long, I think PINS will continue to grow. Now, they drop heavily, this will shake the management team to do better."
safe to add could be bottom of the dip. I'm. long pins.
$pins $upwk $fvrr $etsy The Great Reset
Oversold or some company will buy PINS. Either way hold.
Any chance we can stop the bleeding today?
I predict this will be one of those stocks where investors will be scrambling to buy back their shares after previously dumping them...and then ending up with a higher cost basis than they had originally.
A green day it is. Nice to see that keeping a pace.
"Investors still don’t understand the business model of PINs. It IS NOT a social media platform. It is a image search platform used to direct traffic to other sites that inspire them. You want to sell something, service anything you better use PINS to increase your site traffic. More traffic higher sales. I will be using it for my AirB&B business in coming weeks. Loading the truck. I see the future"
"sold my puts Friday , went long today . it could explode either way from here...."
Bought PINS again today !!
"Cathie Woods bought a lot of PINS, Very GOOD SIGN!!!https://whatdidcathiebuy.com/"
Got my noodle wet today with a cool 100 shares. Big overreaction
Finally we see some positive action …..
added more
"Please keep in mind that, barring a general market crash, PINS has a very limited downside risk. PINS has a low valuation and Mr. Softee is lurking out there waiting for a chance to gobble PINS when the price is right. I say buy all you can at the current price."
"""If investors back out multiple years, they'd see a company growing its user base well within its historic range.What's arguably far more important is that Pinterest continues to see its average revenue per user (ARPU) soar, even as its MAUs retrace a bit. Global ARPU was up 89% in the June-ended quarter, with 163% ARPU growth from international users."""
$250+ in 2 years time.
"My girlfriend is a influencer/social media manager and says that her posts on PINS get close to 50,000 views more than when she posts on FB, INSTA or Tik Tok.. the reach she gets for paid or sponsored posts is unreal. Still a huge player in the social media world - and I’ve been buying all the way down. I made 35% gains on Pins this year alone. Sold - and have bought back in."
"Big news that Zacks upgraded to Strong Buy and one of their ""1"" Rating of stocks today. I've found Zacks to be pretty good and at sometimes somewhat conservative in their picks."
im already in with some shares and now waiting to see the next few days... if there will be good conformation of an uptrand im going all in... it has great potential and is oversold...
PINS this stock is being manipulated so They can buy at a lower share price. So long and this stock will remain bullish
For shareholders who hasn’t checked the newest numbers of the institutional investors:1452 total1406 long only12 short only34 long/shortInstitutional investors represent 89.34%.I think this is terrific.
huge buying here..tomorrow will recover half.
Very suspicious chart this morning. Might be entering squeeze territory
"Pinterest is different from other social media platforms because users come to the site to work on themselves rather than connect with other people. Because Pinners, as the company calls its users, often come to Pinterest with purchase intent related to something like clothes, home goods, or DIY projects, the site is especially appealing to advertisers and lends itself well to e-commerce.If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://stockhaul.today/j2k79w platform"
Huge overreaction.
CRSR and #pins want to red until when? It keeps dropping day by day
"This is going to $65 by mid-August, and $70s by mid-September at a minimum."
Still holding from $15.
Good progress today in a tough market for an oversold company..onwards to 60s next week
"I have always said and will say again, 3 to 5 years is when this stock will be zooming. Buy the dips and hold. They are building something very special."
Starting to look very attractive for buying on the decline. A buy And hold. Cheers
After reading their financials im still confused how they make money. MY wife loves pinterest but she doesn't buy anything on it lol. She mainly uses it for inspiration.
Death cross has occurred (50 day moving average breached below 200-day moving average) PINs may go below $50.
"Hold PINS, this stock is being manipulated"
"short till $48.. its trying to fill the gap at $47, than buy long to $80"
RSI oversold.
"Holding a stock for YEARS is NOT easy. On the contrary. Even without nasty sell-offs like the last 8 weeks it's still brutally hard. So easy to push that button and collect your gains. In large part because sometimes, that's the smart thing to do. Not always. But sometimes. But it's not the right thing to do here with PINS. Because very soon, it will become apparent that there is no better platform in the World, to spend your advertising dollars. Facebook has peaked and has already begun it's descent. Pinterest is only going to take more and more of that e-commerce advertising pie with each passing year. So patience yeah it's a TOUGH gig. But PINS will be $100, $150, $200 per share. NOT tomorrow. But in due time. And then your complaint will be, 'why didn't I buy more shares when it was n double-digits?' lol."
it needs a 10% drop on heavy volume before it can move higher ....
Added more love this discounted price
Can we rebound now? Thanks.
A growth company made a profit. Yay! Let's sell the stock on an dotcom-bubble eyeballs argument. Doesn't make any sense to me. Zero.
this is way overdone. it'll be up eventually. be patient and buy more.
This stock just keeps getting battered...what gives?
Enough is enough .. let’s see a turnaround
"Really the only thing that really matters is the revenue growth, and it was mind blowing! Pinterest serving up the most meaningful, targeted ads, and advertisers are figuring it out! My bet is MAUs and user engagement, will accelerate throughout the rest of 2021, making PINS one of the cheapest stocks in the world!"
Loading the boat.....
$300 is the long term target. Buy and hold.
Infocus purchased PINS no worries.
"Just read article on economy and covid surge. If there is widespread restrictions in the 4Q, or 'shut-downs' whether they be outright by edict or even just in effect, PINS is going to get a boost from that. If the Co. shows further ARPU growth on the November Call, AND there's a surge in covid, it's going to be a very Merry Christmas for PINS' Longs."
"Looking for a green Monday, retest of 60 dollars and hopeful breakout but we will see!"
If this gets any cheaper I'm going to have to liquidate my other positions to go heavy in this. Unbelievable really. The only thing that worries me is the 2 days for funds to settle.
Seems like we found the bottom. Only  from here .
ok...I think this is about bottom..in for a few
No volume. People are holding their shares
"Like I said before, PINS is now in the low 50’s."
Next week this will start it's upward move
Hanging on till October when the earnings report shows growth
Where's the guys who said this going to the 30's ???
"Greeting again, fellow PINS-Heads. First, I must admit I was caught flat-footed when PINS plunged 20% the day after its latest quarterly earning. Since then, the stock drifted lower as I ended up buying more in the open market and being forced to buy more shares due to my 8/20 sell put options. I also ended up buying 2 lots of PIN at 52 and that seems to be the bottom for now.Hopefully, PINS will creep up for the next few weeks, just like what happened last time when the stock hit a bottom of 54. The volume has dried up, so I guess for now the selling pressure is over. We just need more buyers who will bid PINS higher. Cheers and good luck to all."
The selling will start fading tomorrow.
Who else is buying right now?
"Mark my words the only way PINS drops much lower from here is if we get a decline in the general market. Don't miss this buying opportunity if you're bullish on the company. If things remain well for the general market, wouldn't doubt if it's back up to the 70s or 80s by the next earning report, at least high 60s. Not sure how after the report will play out but in the meantime it's a great buy now"
"Can’t believe anyone would sell at these prices. They had user growth, not declines and record profits."
That wasn’t me on the last post. I think we can confidently say that the worst is now behind us. We have found our bottom
Buying opportunity. Place some stink bids. Do not buy the farm. invest wisely and not foolishly. Cheers
Dislocation between the Value of a company and the price of the stock is how big money is made. AMD at $74 a couple months ago is the same AMD at $110. Pins at $56 is the same company as pins at $80.
I have been buying the dips. Have you?
This is a long term hold. It’s now used by a group of people for a wide variety of reasons. As time passes the value of PINS will become abundantly obvious as more and more people use this wonderful service.
Always buy the dip on quality stocks and wait out !!!!
To the moon !
Buy buy before the stock snaps back
"""We have a lot of confidence that the arc of monetization is steep growth, and we have a huge degree of confidence that if it executes, the profits will be enormous, because the margins are so high,”"
This will bounce tomorrow
Delta is going to cause more lockdowns which is going to help this going up by massive numbers and the revenue is going to blow wallstreet away ... once it begin to move up there will be no stopping this train ... all aboard !!!!!!!!
Green Day today. Bet on it.
Can’t do much. Just need to wait some days.
"Ave MAU in perspective. For the 4 years prior to 2020, PINS added an average of 35 million users per year. In 2020, 92 million were added. Hence the comments of pull through users. The MAU growth per year is as follows: 2016 25%, 2017, 23%, 2018 11%, 2019 15%, 2020 25%. The average sequential AMU adds per quarter is 6.3% (counting the past 21 quarters). The lowest quarterly growth in a given year over the 4 years from 2016-2019 has been the 2nd quarter every year and has averaged 2.73%. That means sequential 2nd quarter MAUs has averaged an increase of 2.73% each year. Compare that to an increase of 13.35% in the 2nd quarter of 2020. Combining 2Q 2020 with a 13.35% increase over Q12020 and Q2 2021 sequential -5% you get an average of 4.16% increase, well ahead of the 2.73 percent averaged over the previous 4 years. Yes, I'd like to seem them hold on to those users but you can't expect to hang onto all of them given the situation. Yes I am looking for a silver lining. I might also add that the biggest MAU gains every year 2016-2019 have been in the 3rd quarter. I don't think it's time to cut and run."
Good strength into the close..hopefully bodes well
"My average price is 58 now.I think Pinterest has found its bottom at 57.If nothing goes wrong, it should be a little green EOD and will be more green tomorrow"
found support at 55.10. Sold all shorts Bought calls .. LFG
Honestly what happened? what the..... what number are they blaming this on?
For Bullish buyers short and long term….. shares are getting to an attractive point to buy on dips…Stay alert. Cheers.
See you guys at 80. I have bought enough for now but will add more if we drop below 52... Happy Investing
Every indicator showing a good buy
might just be worth a small.purchase at this price..even if it drops a further 10% it'll be back to 80 within a year
Ark Buys $9M In Pinterest: Why Cathie Wood Firm Is Bullish On Social Media Stock Despite Growth Concerns
Morning star analyst gave Pins 4 stars. it's a buy rating. And fair value estimate is $70.
"It has to hit $55 before going back up, the low from a few months ago. May test $50 with the correction later this month"
"PINS has too much upside potential from here and has been over sold for almost 2 weeks, the longs are holding the 55-56 line. I'm All in long !!! The holidays are upon us and so will the marketing dollars be with PINS"

Enough already!!!Can we at least see 60………..
this will recover in no time.
PE ratio currently 222 
Firm believer in the fundamental of PINS and I am buying the dip every single day!!!!!!! This surely is a long term play and I am confident this will fly to the moon in the near future
I entered back 2650 shares. Hopefully it’s the bottom.
"The AI graphic search is what separates this company apart from all other platforms. Take a pic of something you like, shop and buy. I've been saying this for months. Investors still don't fully understand the potential of this platform."
Some big buys taking it green there. String finish to close the week would be appreciated.
"FB 1T market cap, GOOG 1.8TNo reason why PINS can be at least a 200B market cap in the near future. Thats 4x, about $304 a share."
Nice to see this finish over 54
"I love how the weekend started.Cheers, fellow shareholders."
Keep at these levels until Thursday please. I'm long term bull and I love deeeeeeeep discounts
"On the bright side, at this rate we will be at zero by fall. Brutal."
I just bought 1400 shares. It’s a bargain now
Will bounce back very very fast.
OVERSOLD good entry point!!
Unbelievably undervalued.
shorts aren't being rescued
Green is feeling good
"Sticking to 3-5 year plan and just adding more slowly on this drop. Just don't see how this doesn't grow to a 150B+ market cap in that time frame. Bashers say this is overpriced, what I see is a 40PE on 2022 numbers and a 40-50% CAGR which leaves a 1.0 PEG, just an insanely low valuation. Advertising is and will continue to grow on these platforms and we have no political oversight overhang....stay the course."
PINS is not alone in this madness. My other long-term core Holding APPS announced Earnings results last week and crushed it out of the park. Good argument could be made it was undervalued to peers BEFORE the Earnings report. It has sold off almost $2 per day for the last 7 days. Apparently it's going to $0. With every growth metric just about exploding. So PINS Longs shouldn't think this weakness here is something unique. Pinterest also had a stellar ER and great company performance last Q. Within 3 Q's PINS will be closer to $100 than $50.
PINS to 100 article shows a high return rate and potential growth.
V-shape this week!

aint selling!
check out that gap that needs to fill. pins gets back to 70 within a few weeks
I think their next step should become an attraction of male users. I use it times to time for some advise or motivation in fitness and to calm down by watching nature's photos but it definitely has bigger potential. Once they find out how to make an average man their MAU things will become very bright for the stock.
This is a good stock to own for years.Very low debt level and awesome revenue growth.
Wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft took another run at Pins
"Once people are able to buy directly through the app, we’ll get be competing against giants like Amazon. Extremely bullish"
does pins close green today ....
