SHOP is up 9% and this works with that company. Will beat ER. And be awesome to see 9-10% tick to bring us back to 50.
The buzzards are circling the carcass. In this case the carcass is a misunderstood and under appreciated platform with growing international user base and significant monetization opportunity. If PYPL has passed there are others in the wings. This asset will be acquired.
Last chance for few days to get this stock historical lows. And bye bye 40's. Hello 50's and 60's.
I don't get why PINS getting punished so much. IS it about not letting a big boy(MSFT) to get it? Where is the bottom? Look at the huge price difference between ETSY and PINS. IS it to shake out all retail investors for big money to pick up at discount?
bought more here. A lot more. Averaged up. holding since $14. INTC and PINS are my big picks for the next 2 years.
"Meh, short term investors move on. Long term investors keep adding. $200-$300 in 5 years."
"Numbers, only numbers. PINS has projected earnings of 1.39 for '22. That's a forward PE of < 40 now. Also, they have analyst projected growth of 50%/year for the next 5 years. That means a forward PE of 40, then 20, then 10, the 5 then 2.5 at current prices for the next 5 years. No idea when it will fly, but it will fly at some point. Added another 500 shares today, over 8000 total and will continue to add when they give us this opportunity, Don't listen to the bashers, daily noise - stay with the numbers. :)"
Pinterest reached a 52 Week low at 44.09
THE BOTTOM IS IN
"This company is positioned perfectly. Platform, users, cash. 2 major suitors says it all. We all should be buying all we can here."
"I travel everywhere in the world. I open pinterest app everywhere I visit. Most of the countries I don’t see any add on Pinterest. They have to start advertising on those countries. When I see no ads on most of the countries I visited I see the potential. If they start to monetize on those countries, revenue will double at least. I haven’t even mentioned the in-app purchase option. If they do that, the stock will go up at least $100. But currently it hurts a lot to me to lose everyday."
"I'm gonna say, the world is crazy. Great companies are being under valued and companies you know so so are very over valued now. Look at Esty, look at Tsla, are they really that good? Pins is being punished severely and unfairly. Trust me, time will do the justice. Bought pins at 44.25"
I think everybody thinks that it will drop another 15-20% after er. Me as well. But I cannot sell with a 50% loss. I feel like a bagholder. Don’t know what to do except waiting.
Strong buy. Revenue could be big beat.
"Use the Pins app, Get everyone you can to do it too. Support the product."
"Cheap shares, $100+ end of 2022. GLTA"
why not just go all the way back down to 10 and start over again ..
Would be nice if the CEO actually made a statement about what happened with PayPal ... who backed out ... I’m hoping Pins did because they know what a huge quarter this is ... less than a week remains to see the truth ... thinking this stock will drop before earnings because of Powell on Wednesday but the rebound will be ASTONISHING !!!!!!!
"You guys can keep talking about guessing about the value of pins. The floor has been confirmed by both Microsoft @80 and even pay pal @70. Not sure where the bottom is, but I guarantee we are a long ways away from where the top will be."
I cant take the pain anymore sold all took solid loss good luck longs
This will be $200 in 2023
The only reason paypal pulled 70/shr offer was cause shareholders thought it was overpriced. The drop to 44 is insane and screaming buy.
Excited for earnings. Looks like international ARPU could really start taking off. Huge fan of the Diwali initiative in India. Huge user base there.
I am gonna take yet another opportunity to add more shares of PINS with these prices. 500 more today. 2.5K now. Always invest at your own risks. To me this is a very good opportunity and willing to take this risks for a longer term.
Should see $50 next week before earnings. Shorts won't want to press their big gains into earnings.
If you think the quarter is going to be alright you should be playing the Nov 5th call options in the $50-$52 strike price as it is cheap compared to the upside. You can buy the $52 option for .48 cents. At these between down levels any news on mau stabilization will send the stock price to those levels
Google buys this will be much better synergy.
Don’t buy on margin. One term holding. Buy and Hold. Microsoft will look at PINS in the future.
How the algo know I just bought 5 mins ago?
"When I see how many people on this forum are throwing the towel, I become more confident that we have reached bottom."
Very low.. should I buy?
"Next earnings report will probably show international maus growing, the decline in America MAUS won't be as bad as some may think and earnings will continue to grow so in other words worst case scenario for earnings will have been averted and people will realize how good a future this company has since we have a $44 price Right now basically cut in half from the all time high I believe even if this goes down very briefly it will quickly rebound there really isn't much room for sp to go down like there was last earnings report very low expectations are already priced in anything modestly good this thing will fly which is different from a normal earnings that we are used to with this ticker I'm expecting a mixed earnings report and a recovering sp in the low to mid 50s by end of next week that said a better then expected ER and this is easily north of $60"
Mario is panicking hahahaha.
https://news.shopify.com/shopify-and-pinterest-launch-new-channel-allowing-merchants-to-target-platforms-350m-monthly-usersSHOP went up two straight days. This will too.
"Just trying to understand the logic. MSFT offers 80. PYPL rumored to offer 70 but investors are selling into the 40's? So, if someone wants to buy my house for 500k should I sell for 300K? Just trying to understand. I'm an old-timer but this free money. Investing has changed since the Robinhood generation came online. Normally, people would HOLD. My guess is that big money is pushing out weak hands to get back for a cheaper price. That is fine by me. Gives me more shares."
"Operating Revenue:2018-08: $292.55M. 2021-06: $2.25B.  If you believe they can continue this growth, this is a great buy right now."
Great entry for long term position
If you liked it at $64 you should love it at $45 LOAD THE BOAT !!!
Back to the 50$ next week leading up to ER
Can’t wait to hear PINS side of the story. They will probably say they will be better off on their own. A merger/buyout is not good for shareholders.
