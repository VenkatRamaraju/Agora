Welcome to Roku!
the selling of the retail research arm of Nielsen was always the intent when they announced the split of the divisions a year ago...hence the long delay of implementation...the late Mr Nielsen just turned over in his grave with the announced sale today (11/1)
"Confirmed deal is done. Happened very late last night. Price still being finalized, somewhere around $31, $32 and change. Comes down to NPV and EBITDA calculations...details. Call options buyers the last couple of days will be VERY happy (and should be investigated)."

"Glad I bought the investor day news. Now the question is do you buy more, sell the news, or hold? Any opinions on the direction of this company?"
"Tomorrow is earning day, still nobody visiting here :("
Nielsen is up 4.94% to 20.38
They're squabbling on price. Also still considering if they should break up watch and buy into pieces or sell it whole. The debt is the big issue right now.
"OK. Price action from today shows that momentum is done and tired with this stock. Simply no more buyers out there. This thing will see $22 in the next 4 weeks. Mark my words and sell as best you can. There is no reason with the earnings they announced, that the stock held up this much, even with the private equity interested in it. Pain coming."
