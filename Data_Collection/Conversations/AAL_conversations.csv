The market is up and AAL handing to 19$
buy today for a 50% return by early 2022 or maybe even before the end of 2021
"Sure, fares will be going up to compensate for higher fuel costs. Thankfully, human nature will prevail, and travelers will absorb the costs. The desire to see loved ones and escape from the rat race is a powerful thing."
I notice every time market up and it is down means next day it rally so watch tomorrow
"American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) had its target price increased by equities researchers at Morgan Stanley from $21.00 to $23.00 in a research report issued to clients and investors on Tuesday, Benzinga reports. The brokerage currently has an ""underweight"" rating on the airline's stock. Morgan Stanley's price target would suggest a potential upside of 19.11% from the stock's current price. $UAL $LUV $DAL"
CHEAP!!!!!! REALLY CHEAP! BUY BUY BUY NO DOUBT!!!! ADD 600 MORE!
"I would not be too concerned about the European Union banning Americans from visiting Europe. In the wide picture, the insignificant amount of current travel between Europe and America will not make a difference in the revenues of American Airlines. It is already factored in the stock price at 23.15. Use this opportunity to buy cheaper. Hold on to your shares and make very decent money. I am buying at 19.53 and comfortable with it. The rate of infections and vaccinations is moving the needle very fast We are within close distance from achieving Herd Immunity. The Pandemic for all practical purposes, I see the pandemic as irrelevant. Let the Hedge funds play with the price. Just make sure you buy in the low prices. and you can can sell it later at a profit."
Massive feeding frenzy on October 1st!!! Buy all the AAL you can get….
"Uncle has talked about Airlines stepping forward to reaffirm already guided down quarter which was neither so good or bad, Uncle has talked about people using Confusing Monday to plan for better Tuesday as they ""normally"" do. This is so unique with the airlines which eventually will go back to the norm, people knew it all along but they want to time it Right. Don't know why they're in a hurry, they're mostly much younger than Uncle. Keep your pants Up while you're running around. Uncle gives a minute to tell the Long Shoremen to speed up their technology, they made too much much for being too lazy, government should take over our sea ports, we gotta get our goods moving."
"The shorts are trying hard to keep it down, but the volume will overwhelm them."
I remember when Oil prices were 145/barrel and American Airlines still turned a huge profit. Let's face it. It is not about if America Airlines is going to be profitable or not. American Airlines making huge money is not connected to its stock price. The price is connected to the HF ripping people off. Too many shorts in the stock and they squeeze you like a bug. Too many longs and they bring the stock down ripping you out of your hard earned money. The airlines are heading into making big money. Ticket prices are going up almost 50 percent for thanks giving. Not to mention they are transporting people right now better than 2019.
"well, this is a fun climb,"
Told you folks early morning pump would be very delish! LOL
All of my international friends are back in the states. They said 70-80% of the seats are filled. I think that 3q of aal will be strong.
"If the Wall Street crooks downgrade stocks then buying calls against their own ""judgement"", that'll be immoral, if not illegal. Uncle can't speculate that, Uncle simply saw lots of Calls placed on the Airlines."
"Shouldn't be a Normal Wednesday as the quarterly Windows Dressing is going on, Airlines have already guided Downward for this and next quarter, the market should look forward and position for the full recovery next year."
last stock id thought be up on a day like today...shows whybypu cant time the market
Gentlemen I’m observing AAL for 2 years but it seems it’s heading to 19$ mark my words
"AAL will be back over $25 soon and will be a good long term signal. With high holiday travel just around the corner, and the COVID fears are getting behind us.....as people recognizing COVID is being politicized. I expect a slow crawl in 2022 back to pre-COVID levels around $50."
"Jumped back in with AAL, UAL with the huge oil surplus just reported, which will help with fuel costs"
Speaking about myself I believe in Airlines industry big time but common sense their will be bull for the time being my strategy buying when it dip
Gentlemen’s I like the Airlines industry but the outlook m from know to holidays is not promising at all for the whole industry as thy are burning cash insanely and the earnings is after 14 days stays away till med of December where I see they will start to recover by Q1 2022
I am afraid - aa may drop to $1 before heading back $32 by the end of oct
Quoc'a Mayor in oaklandgives a good job by handher buck teeth should be bannedwhile her knobs are granddoes AAL service Oaklamd?????DOES oAKLAND SERVICE aal?
"Parker gave 3Q numbers ahead of time, showing little higher Revenue and Less Non-GAAP Loss."
"American is planning on hiring 1000 pilots in 2022, the broader industry is looking fir 7000 pilots, $$$"
"Here are my reflections on the day, as it relates to airline stocks...UAL closed at a solid +1.39%, which may seem like peanuts if you think it was up 4% an hour before close. However, a stock that has been hammered like the airline industry has in the last 2 months, is unlikely going to close any higher than 2% on a single day (unless there is a huge catalyst). Day traders who have bought the dip will take their profits before the bell rings. Which is exactly what happened today.Ultimately the industry will be back as soon as vaccinations start being at a good level and infections drop below an acceptable one as well. If you are looking to make a quick profit with the likes of $UAL, $AAL or $DAL, you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for growth in the next 3 or so months and have bought in at July - August prices, you will be doing well.Anyway, good luck to you all."
"The airlines shares were doing better during the first stage of the pandemic, the market was more green and just a single positive story will rocket the shares to the sky, now we read all positive news about airlines with no huge jump as it used to be last year. $UAL $DAL $LUV"
Big day tomorrowLets see how it opens up !!!
"Heavy put action. Change in open interest on June 2022 10 dollar put. 24949 today. Also, change in 1/20/23 open int, 12 dollar put 39832. Found it on Barchart. Comments? Don't own stock at all just curious."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"What do you good people feel about the extra unemployment benefits boost that just ended. Yes, unemployment was a problem but now people will be looking for work again. A boost to the economy? But before the boost a little dip in the numbers?"
I heard about AAL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
In another market AAL would be $4 based on these riding jet fuel prices and already hardly any profit to make any dent paying back debt.
This news alone will push all airline to northward of 20 to 30% higher by holiday season
"30 by middle of October, year end booking starts"
"King Fish Keay is only positive on ALK, negative on all others. Poor guy has not been Right for a while. The recent downgrade of DAL was based on ""valuation"" (above his expectation), we'll see DAL's Report this Wednesday. In the meanwhile, people are buying up Calls on Airlines against King's ""warnings"". This is all very weird."
Bloodbath for the stock market today..AAL hung in there tho!Yeee!!!
"China, Power Outage; India Power Outage. They're causing Supply Chain Problem, Big Problem.It's funny that the Shipping Rate all of the sudden tanked and we have shortage of goods to be Shipped.In the meanwhile, some Auto makers are stock piling their inventories to cause others problems.This is weird year, the spread of natural gas here and the World is so Huge that even caused professional traders to lose their pants.Maybe, only maybe, the Airlines are really no good as most shortsters have claimed, but will they lose their pants if stocks move in the Opposite direction they're so ""sure"" of?"
This will hit $16 after earnings
just want to have a note: on 10/06/2021 GS downgraded AAL to $18 from $19. FCC should investigate any firms trading activities when they upgrade or down grade a stock.
I don't see how this company can stay in business much longer.
"Yesterday AAL went down to $19.01, then shot up to $20.60, all you have to do is .........."

"STOP thinking what the Dead Fish said, STOP!"
15% of the whole number of shares go to shorties but they still can manipulate the share price.
Airlines are doomed just face the facts
"Amazing, the Dow and Nasdaq are both negative 530, and 392 respectively and the airlines are above water. That tells you how much of an unjustified beating they have taken, and the huge numbers of travelers they are transporting does not correlate to the actual stock prices. Anyone foolish to hold a short position is getting burned. AAL stock price will be above 25 in the near future."

People talking about business travel is never coming back.. who cares… rec travel will boom as WFH blues keep rising. Companies will soon dangle vacation benefits to attract candidates for wfh/hybrid roles
Tomorrow 22-23 for sure!!!!
"Very suspicious that all the major Airlines declared lower revenue guidance with negative growth, and they all get the biggest take off in months. In addition, They robbed investors long on the way down, and now, they are robbing shorts on the way up."
"bought the dip and averaged down, OK, thats enough, lets start climbing..."
AA - is a strong buy at this level - buy and heading back to $35
October 1st is a buying rally for AAL… Time for a Game Stopper….
"Delta reported its first quarter making profits?? oil prices are going up?... So what? I can't pass the higher fuel prices to my customers!!! LOL!! yeah! right!! Like I said, airline tickets are going up 50% by Thanks giving. You don't believe it check it out.LOL Money to be made like there is no tomorrow. Make tons of money on the way down, make tons of money on the way up. It does not matter to me. But it makes me laugh the excuses they come up to move the price of AAL."

Aal is heading into $24 in mid October that is where Holidays travel began.
"Fuel Costs or Not, DAL has problems outside of Fuel ""predicting"" profit loss in 4Q21, that's HUGE difference from Street expectation of making 33c/share.

This will be at 28 next weekend after the earning report.
Never depending on what the analysis say for you to buy or sell your stocks. Do you own work for your investment .
According to GS - they want AA drop more and buy lower - add some shares while on sale - hope it drops to $1
"Now, if you are more like me. You hedge your longs to take advantage of the price drops and cash big on the way down."
"The travel demand is very high right now, and it will continue all the way until end of next year, the only thing that pull back all airlines stock is just the fuel price - it's more like an excuse for the analyst to cast a gloomy future for airlines stock, airlines company will hedge fuel price for sure, they are not first day in business. Besides, fuel price is something that government can interfere, this is not pandemic, OPEC has to do something about it. $AAL $UAL $DAL are all in bargain price now, buy at this price and just hold on to it, and you will have handsome return next year."
"Shories, I don't like seeing you losing money, you gotta do your research to find out that AAL is working to get the buying point @$26. Wish you a happy holiday seasons :)$UAL $LUV $DAL"
"time to buy oversold stocks(airlines, cruises, and ba), market is about to sell overbought meme and fang stocks that have skyrocketed in the past 12-18 months"
this stock will be 21.90 tomorrow
Any idea why AAL is the only airline declining today?
"Based on TSA data, passenger throughput has maintained a trend of constant improving in the past 8 months, which may reach/overlap with pre-pandemic levels after a couple of weeks in September or in October."
Nov 8th travel ban being lifted for vaccinated travelers
"Also Why is Delta so concerned about oil prices? Delta owns its own refinery, and Delta sells to itself jet fuel at cost. Delta also bring revenue from selling refined Jet fuel to the airline industry. Delta's refinery is bringing in a lot of money to Delta. The higher the oil prices, the higher the margins. In addition, low stock price for Delta gives them big opportunity to compensate their Management with Stock options which will turn into big pay outs at the expense of the retail investor."
"even unvaccinated Americans can come back (with a negative covid test within one day of travel) and its global ban lifting not just UK, EU. basically open everything with precautions, like just a mask, maybe a vaccine card or negative test. dropping quarantines and testing at gates or outright ban. this is great start"
"best investment ever at this point, we will reach $35 , without any doubt"
"Look at Silly things people do in the Past, and lagging effects.Rig Counts: All-Time High 1,609 Week of 10/10/2014 (Oil $85.87), down to 316 on Week of 5/27/2016 (Oil $49.36) (595 Days)Up to 888 on 11/16/2018 ($56.49) (903 Days), Down to 172 on 8/14/2020 ($42.05) (637 Days)Uncle showed the Oil Prices as well.The current Rig Count is back to 428, the week of 10/1/2021."
Vaccines will push this stock to the moon. Mandatory movement is on. Gotta love it!
So Goldman wants to load up. That's what they do...put out an article that drives the share price down and then they buy like crazy knowing the stock is heading to $28-$30. I've seen it many times.
I heard about AAL the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I’ll sell at 32
AAL was $40 before pandemic. Manipulation by hedge funds. Long & strong!
"48B dollars in debtthat's where the CV19 has left them4% interest rate => $1.92B per year without paying down the principleWhat airline has the most debt?

Goldman downgrade AAL because fuel is expensive and so on but upgraded the delta. dont make sense. Also funny thing is people actually follow them what they say.
"October 1st AAL will have a massive feeding frenzy by a ton of sharks, whales, and even lone minnows… Join the frenzy and buy…."
"Take it Easy, it's simply another Normal Friday - Mostly down but sometimes give Big surprises.Airlines are currently classified as ""Short-term"" Buy, which is very obvious."
"There were 54,728,157 shares volume traded on Friday, AAL was on the top of the most traded shares along with AAPL and AMC that day, the Q3 initial data comes positive yesterday, we all waiting for the F35 take off."
Uncle thinks AAL has big chance to get to $21 this month.
"How Many Times can Kirby be Wrong?orCan he be Right Once More?By the way, Uncle still has the same question: Will AAL close above $22.50 before earnings?It's just a Question, not an Answer.$22.50 must be bleached before anybody may start preciting Higher Number, that's common sense."

"AAL SHAREHOLDERS.............................If 30% of the airline industry is fired in the next 2 months because of federal covid policy, what happens? Right now 50% of air traffic controllers in USA are non vaccinated. If they don't get shot they are to be fired by Dec 8, 2021 according to the executive branch and congress of the United States."
AAL seems have power to go $25 now.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, AAL keeps going up!"
Why buy?? This is heading back to $17 when interest rates rise and they take on more debt to meet their cash demands
"Cautiously Optimistic is the Right Words to say regarding to the Airlines, there will be no shortage of Airline Bashers and some Dead Fish who live in their basements trying to shoot down the sector whenever they can.The question is still whether AAL will close above $22.50 before the earnings, this is a Question, not an Answer."
"Very Normal Tuesday, ALL DAY! Uncle Says.Windows Dressing in progress ..."
We will see extraordinary levels $AAL $WIMI
"Does it make any sense? lack of pilots in Asia due to high mortality covid 19 rate has left the Asian Cargo planes without pilots. American and the other US airlines are left to pick up the cargo. Cargo prices are going through the roof among airlines. Big revenues are already coming in, and for the holidays untold wealth is building up for the airlines. Who among the analysts is even talking about it. No one!!. Incredible amounts of money coming to Delta, AAL, and United. It is perplexing!!"
Time to consider loading up your long positions my friends
AA Miami Punta Cana oversold. Airport full.
"The only reason GS downgraded AAL is because they are probably shorting it, and when they hit there number they will upgrade it. Total crooks"
This is a 20 dollar stock at best AT Best
"yeah, had a low-ball bid in for only 50 shares, (just to keep my share total in round numbers) 2600. and it hit. love the dips. Filled Buy 50 AAL Limit 19.35"
"Same ole , Monday is day of Confusion, Tuesdays and Thursdays are good, Wednesdays and Fridays are Bad. for the airlines.Also, same ole question: Will AAL see $22.50 again this quarter?"
Where are those no good shorts that were yelling bankruptcy and $15-$17.They made good people lose their hard earned money!
"Resisted really well today, Airline ride started"

"I think for a fact the market in general was more green last year than now, we see reddish market almost everyday. What is really going on?"
"The Red Cross just knocked on my door and asked if we could contribute towards the floods in Pakistan . I said we'd love to, but our garden hose only reaches the driveway."
"Sadly seems oing back below $20 this game should be illegal. It will be at some point. Good news, vaccine, booster shots, covid pill, international travel and GS comes up with a low price target for these stock."
"a funny story from Uncle.........""I was laying on the couch with my friend (and by friend I mean this girl I was madly in love with). She kept playfully reaching up my shorts and playing with my now erect shaft. Suddenly her 3-year-old runs into the room out of nowhere and jumps onto my lap.I think I set a new world record for going limp. But I had a look of sheer horror on my face for at least a millisecond."""
the word circulating the net is that the AAL pilots about to follow in LUV's footsteps and have a sickout over the vaccine mandates.
FYI major reversal incoming the run up is starting buy now or chase $AAL $WIMI
"Gonna be selling short a lot of shares of AAL before market close today. This play is a departure from my normal Pure Earnings short sells, but the earnings calendar is very slow for the rest of this week, and AAL is just winking at me, begging me to play her Short right here as a 1-3 day play. Stock looks poised to fall down to the $18.00 level very soon. Way over-valued, and recent sector-specific bad news is absolutely not priced in. Look at WYNN and LVS, both down over 10% today, while AAL has barely moved, even though the over-valuation here is worse, and the ongoing Covid impacts can be expected to hit the airline industry harder than the casino/hotel sector.Happy to Short this and see an excellent chance at a 6-12% downside move over the next 1-3 days."
"Bye Shorts, Don't forget to write.............."
They had some interesting insights about AAL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
High oil prices is old news!America is opening up and people wanna have fun again!No more lockdowns and lots of ways to treat and prevent COVID-19!
Will reach 26$ within 2-3 weeks.Investors are going back to value-stocks.

The analyst remains positive on the path to profitability recovery for the airlines over the medium-term, but reduced December quarter and 2022 outlooks as she mark-to-markets for fuel and a worse short-term revenue environment than previously expected.O'Brien expects American shares to underperform saying the company's ""relatively higher"" operating leverage will weigh on its profitability recovery in a weaker industry pricing environment over the medium-term. Meanwhile, the analyst expects JetBlue's costs to continue its codeshare partnership with American will outstrip revenue driven by the alliance over the medium-term, especially given the pricing pressure she expects to see across the industry due to elevated capacity and corporate/international demand ""that will likely still be in recovery."""
Today red or green ?
"Looks very controlled to get all that option premiums between $20 n.$21...congress talks about Facebook algorithms, what about the hedge funs n MM algorithms? This is criminal n.Congress needs to investigate NOW!!!"

Two days ago it was a screaming buy says Morgan Stanley. Today it got a downgrade to sell from Goldman. It makes no sense except to move the stock price up and down so the big boys can get in or get out. The SEC needs to investigate these so-called analysts.
Sold some share today and wait for lower price.... Airline is still long way to recover....
"If you did not load up at 19.62, you should not be trading. The ongoing pressure is upward not downward. This drop in price is a nice little gift. You should reduce risk on the rally to free capital and buy on the dips to increase your profitability."
"Morgan Stanley, a reputable investing Bank, puts the AAL target price according to assets, debt, and cash flow projections at 23.00/share. I had it at 23.50. In summary, AAL is way undervalued by at least 3.30. The Airline will report minimum loss with a recovery in the near horizon. Since so many unvaccinated people have died of Covid, it has become clear that vaccination is the only way to minimize the risk of death. Many people are vaccinating now and the use of face masks as added protection against infection will help the economy to recover. Invest in AAL now, you will not regret it if you hold it to at least 25.00/share."
I’ll not be surprised if opens tomorrow 19is$
"""Normal"" Tuesday for the Airlines, a little hangover from confusing Monday to start..."
"If the Feds pass a vaccine requirement for air travel, say goodbye to the airline recovery for years."
US to relax EU and UK travel restrictions for vaccinated passengers - Financial TimesLet that sink in! Borders to open in November. Cash cow for both the US and European long haul carriers!
In Merck we trust!!AAL BABY!!!
It is very obvious that the price target by GS of 18.00/share is out of desperation for the loss they are carrying from their short positions.
"Think in the long run, hold it for long time, ""after rain the Sun will come out"" or Silver Lining Baby, AAL company is great company, They will ride past this storm, this covid 19, hold on to your shares for a few months, every body hold, the buyer will offer more money to buy AAL shares. HOLD ON tight to your shares"
"Everybody Positioned Well Yesterday all for the Normal Tuesday as Uncle Said.People are getting Smarter these days, only Smart People.Uncle didn't even get a thumb down Yesterday."
"Just as predicted, yesterday’s TSA number is slightly below the 2019 same day of week before Labor Day holiday number. Massive number of American’s are vaccinated and becoming vaccinated. Travel will recover sooner than the doomsayers gloomy forecasts. Patience remains a virtue."
Look at the volume againShorter are covering their position!!!
"Regardless of being Uncle's favorite Tuesday, Parker's giving timely Update helps the airlines Today.Parker is man of Today.Tomorrow, Delta will report GAAP loss and NON-GAAP Profit, the consensus is for them to make EPS 17c/share with 8.4bn revenue."
Monday - Day of Confusion...People don't know what to do after weekend...
48B dollars in debtthat's where the CV19 has left them4% interest rate => $1.92B per year without paying down the principleWhat airline has the most debt? AAL
All airlines are up except American Airlines. Manipulation in full force
Morgan Stanley target price is $23.00 whereas Goldman has downgraded it to $18.00. Are they using different analytical tools that creates a price gap of $5.00? Does Goldman think by downgrading AAL passengers will stop flying or the actual TSA passengers data will differ or maybe the earning report will start changing colors. It is very obvious that Goldman wants to make a huge profit by loading up more shares by spreading sentimental reports.
"Going back below $20 … this game should be illegal. It will be at some point. Good news, vaccine, booster shots, covid pill, international travel and GS comes up with a low price target for this stock."
"Vaccines will readily available to any country who wants it.Mrk, Pfe, Moderna, Astra, and soon Inovo.All border entry soon be open and Air travel are now starting gather steam"
"Like GE, AAL should forward split and keep the stock price above 100 to keep the shorts out of this"
aal just got downgraded to 18
This dip ain’t the bees knees..But it’s okay. Long and strong  We gettin on the mile high club baby!
"ATTENTION gullible dummies: There will be NO STRIKE!!! Under the Railway Labor Act, airline employees must participate in a lengthy mediation process expressly designed to force a resolution before they can strike. If mediation fails, the president may order a 60-day cooling-off period–during which airline workers must return to work–if he feels a strike would substantially disrupt the national transportation system. If this fails, Congress may force both sides to accept a settlement, or may extend the cooling-off period indefinitely. This is what happened to American Airlines pilots two years ago: President Clinton ordered the cooling-off period four minutes after they went on strike, and they were forced to accept a settlement."
