US govt is using American Airlines for two weeks to transport Afghan people and Americans out of Kabul

Should I sell my aal stocks or wait
"Monday is a Good day to watch, over sold AAL, go to the Moon ............"
AAL seems very strong now.
"To our shorts out there. I hope you guys are not holding hopes of this stock going under 19.00 again. Everything is possible, but if AAL hits under 19 again, I will buy like crazy. There is no way that another great buying opportunity like that presents again."
American Airlines during the summer when travel was very high they were ￼canceling flights￼ and blaming it on the weather so they would not have to pay expenses￼ For passengers￼
"When you trade the airlines, the money you allocate has to be distributed in portions. Forget Margin. Do not use margin to trade in the airlines or you run the risk of a margin call. Say the stock price is 25.00 per share and you think it can go down to 10.00 per share. In addition, you would like to own 1000 shares and go long to 35 or 40. Starting with a price of 25 dollars, you buy 166 shares every time it drops 2.50. If it moves upward then you wait until it reaches 27.50 and wait for 2.50 retracing to buy again. This strategy minimizes loss and increases your gains. If your goal is to own 10,000 shares, you buy 1660 every time you reach your mark. Don't sell any shares before you have 10,000 shares above the 2.50 mark of your average price, and if you decide to sell everything at that point you just made 25,000 dollars."

Why is only AAL and Spirit experiencing all these cancellations we are hearing about?
The jobs number missed big time the expectations number!!
Oct. $21 calls are looking like a good idea
American Air passengers are stranded all across the USA. AAL illegally threatened to fire employees who are not vaccinated. Flight crews are not showing up for work. Forcing experimental vaccines on unwilling people is a violation of international law.
"Yesterday I bought 5000 at 19.51 and today I bought 5000 more at 20, I will sit down to wait for the profits drinking a glass of good red wine ,,,, stop below 19.50 at closing"
"The reasons for my postings is to help you see the wider picture. If you would like to have a solid understanding of day trading please go on YouTube and watch Warrior Trading By Ross Cameron. He has some insights that can help you develop your day trading skills. My strategies to make money have some similarities to his strategies, but I learned through 25 years of daily trading the Airlines everything I need to survive. I go with the market, with the path of least resistance. I short the stock when I have to, and go long when I have to. I am not trying to convince you that I am right. I am only sharing what I am thinking and what I am doing to make money to pay my bills."
"To Everyone, that bought AAL, and Didn't Panic sale ............."
buy today for a 50% return by early 2022 or maybe even before the end of 2021
Sweet bankruptcy! <3
Airlines are starting to make profits now and positive cash flows so unsure why the selling
Today bull or bear ??
"FOMO YOLO was waiting for 19.21 but take a chance at 19.60 GLTA lets get some good news, jobs report suppose to be good,"
"FDA's fully approval of Pfizer Vaccine will be a game changer; more people will take up the vaccine, including those #$%$ mandated to take one at work. It will happen and it is happening, and with so many people who have already infected (and got protection) and higher inoculation rate, hopefully we'll go back to normal in October."
"Oil is cheaper, travel volume still high - a recipe for airline performance gains. In it to win it long. COVID news fatigue is real and vaccinations are on the rise again. Don’t be surprised if cases drop precipitously. Once AAL is back over 30, I’ll sell some to reinvest in other underperforming sectors. This is fun and lucrative!"
"Just creamshooted, felt GOOD <3"
Pilot shortage and flight restrictions and with the rumors increasing from virus and political issues this for me is a sell. The only profitable  airline is Allegiant
"Just buy the stock and hold on to it, this is a stock that been beaten up to no end, enough is enough, I don't see problem to travel if you are vaccinated."
Nobody is Flying.............
Curious if we get to $25 by the end of Summer.... I think $22 is realistic number. But who knows!
"low life UK is going to restriction again, hopeless country."
Lets dance for a green week!
"Load up on AAL, before it brakes $20, because it's Not coming back down .............."
"The share price will go 30 cent up and down till the end of September, then will go up just before the earning call in October."
This will drop 5-8% today. $16 might come next week or early September.
AAL has good resistance power at $19.5We hope it could rise from this point
Coming One year will be awesome forget short term
Me watching AAL today ...........
It looks like a great day to make money!!!
"SSDD, drop in the morning, raise all day, close Green."
"S&P Up, Dow Up BIG, Airlines are ALL UP, and Uncle was in Red without all-time high Today.This is very crazy market, Very.That said, SouthWest sees weakening outlook with tickets cancelled the last moment, close-in price was also weak due to Virus, the PAX numbers were just little bit weaker so far this month at 78.59% for the last 10 days, compared to 79.65% of 2019 in July."
What a manipulated scam this is along with the entire stock market these days. This was trading 20% higher start of the year before any of their planes took off.....Nothing makes sense in todays fraudulent market
$AAL $UAL $DAL every chart is exactly the same. So NONE of this is about the companies. Only about overarching narratives and sentiment. So we are trading emotional fake scare swings.
"AAL was trading in 40’s and 50’s pre-pandemic, also tanked into the 30’s pre-pandemic. From there the tanking only got worse, it will take years for it to rebound completely and even then with staffing shortages, high fuel costs, financial losses, debt accumulation, unlimited covid variants, this is not making more than 10-20 percent and will take a least a year and will likely tank before it “fully” recovers… I’m not getting back in until I see it hit 12-15, only reason it’s not there is bc you wishful thinkers dumping your life savings into it"
What just happened??? Blew my mind
I see that AAL is expressing an opinion on the Texas abortion law. Good business decision?
How y’all true AAL players in here fee about earnings tomororw morning?
Again record travel more than 2019 without international .And HF MF bring the hold sector down
"Closing Green today, and Up over another $1 tomorrow !! (Mark this post)"
How can AAL is the only airline stock that still red today?
Just joined the coach with 1500 shares…let’s see how this baby rolls..
"For Long term players, you could hold till $40, sleep for a month and no need to concern the process.For Mid-term players, you could hold AAL till $25.5-$26, sometimes, it could break a little bit to $26.8(but not sure.)For Short term players, I believe AAL still has a power to taste nearly $22.8-23.5 in the coming 1 or 2 days."
$40 is target.100%+Who follows?
"Same ole , Monday is day of Confusion, Tuesdays and Thursdays are good, Wednesdays and Fridays are Bad. for the airlines.Also, same ole question: Will AAL see $22.50 again this quarter?"
Supposed to be Trading at $29!!!!
AAL is fully book all flight in and out of Vegas.Especially from Houston to Vegas and back.
"Following the European markets last night in the down trend the US stocks are also going down. Yesterday the Airlines were so oversold that Hedge Funds are not sure they can risk short selling today, as a result the airlines are into positive territory to compensate for yesterday's overselling. At this point movement is undefined. The Asian markets are up making it difficult for the US to chose a trend. Anything that drops AAL close to 18 should be a buying opportunity."
"THis really is only running in place, up a buck, down a buck....but why own this one versus UAL/DAL given AAL's debt load?"
"EU bans US travel, have to live with this downturn for another few weeks, long term, no impact"
"This stock trades at $19.95. And to be honest I’m extremely bullish. Target price: $24. That gives the stock 20% upside. Wall Street as well is bullish. Many analysts even the bearish ones are bumping up target prices. Huge demand for travel and covid delta variant ain’t stopping no one have you see Disney, Las Vegas, and cruises. Their partying. Invest rn. You won’t regret it I just picked up another 200 shares let’s go BABYYY"
Trust me you’ll get on a winning streak if you stick with it.$WIMI $AAL $NFLX
People talking about business travel is never coming back.. who cares… rec travel will boom as WFH blues keep rising. Companies will soon dangle vacation benefits to attract candidates for wfh/hybrid roles
Sitting on about 12 thousand shares in 3 different accounts.
"We're back to ""Normal"" week with bad Wednesday, good Tuesday and Thursday.We have Delta and AAL pre-announced ""bad"" guidance, yes, they're ""bad"" but not as worse as the Street has expected. This upsets the Papa Bears and Mama Bears."
This stock is being manipulated by some billionaire to make money on options. Taking it up and down. It should be warren buffer taking revenge from his loss on the airlines stocks. 
"Down 100% trying to squash open options for tomorrow. It's no longer INVESTING, it's manipulation."
"Bought 1330 more shares @ 19.48, Thanks for the Gift!!"

Waiting on $17's before any buys and only taking a position bc when market corrects so will AAL most likely revisiting $14's.
CDC saying covid delta as contagious as chiken poxI’ve never even had chiken pox 
tomorrow up 21
Planes were empty on the long hauls (where AAL makes the most money) CFO said August numbers are terrible and likely Q3 and Q4 will look bad as the COVID DELTA variation again stops travel. Business travel and budgets have be slashed for 2022 because COVID shutdowns proved it was not needed to do well (hello zoom) -- it will be a very bad year for AAL.
this stock will be 21.90 tomorrow
"....a report stated that American Airlines’ August revenues are falling below its expectations due to fresh spike in coronavirus cases.Amid the prevalent pandemic, American Airlines’ chief revenue officer, Vasu Raja, said, “This has been and we expect will continue to be a very choppy recovery”, at the Raymond James investor conference"
"170k+ shares shorted after market, this stock is toast.$17 here we go <3"
Look at the volumeShorts are covering their position!!I can see 23-25 coming in next week or maybe tomorrow!!!
Therefore I just bought couple airlines stocks I believe it is on the right direction
"250,900 passengers travel on American Airlines yesterday. It was more than Delta and more than United. American Airlines continue to transport more passengers than the other Airlines."
"Reading the Tea Leaves, close on Friday, between $21.50 and $22.00"
"Quoc, have you flown AAL lately?"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/statement-american-airlines-civil-air-213105110.html
"Knew AAL would give it all up and more. Its the worst of the airlines and no reason to invest w them prior to UAL,ALK or DAL."
Just can't win..
"Unbelievable. The Dow 30 dropping more than 100, AAL still on rally.AAL seems to go breakthrough to $25.0"
lots of volume for AAL. Is that supposed to mean money is moving in?
Does AAL is heading to bk again?I flew AAL from Houston to PA and it was full even standby ticket holder can not get in and the share price continue it downward slop.
what constantly worries me about AAL is the high debt level 30 bil.
17 before 20 -- maybe NEVER 20 again :( so sorry bag holders
"As I worked for 1 of the big 3, Airline stocks are never great, but this is a no brainer, AA trading low, post COVID bookings are already skyhigh. Normally I would say stay AAway, but this will be an ex money maker"
"I think for a fact the market in general was more green last year than now, we see reddish market almost everyday. What is really going on?"
$30 by March
18's tomorrow
I manage to scoop a few shares at 19.58. I have been loading up. This is a buying opportunity that will make money.
Last chance to sell before $17...
"DOW 3o has reached 34500 in the pre-market, touched the ground already.I hope the downward has been finished and money coming back to buy the dip.No matter taper or increase interest rate.The most strong economy and empire, USA will not stop go rally."
"Good Morning America. The European Markets are all up and in the green. The Asian Markets the same. US Futures are up as well. However there was a significant drop in the Aug 31st, TSA numbers down to 1.35 million, and that could be a spoiler for the Airlines today. Looking at the ranges, AAL has the potential to move up to 20.76 or down to 19.12. We will have to wait for the first 10 minutes of trading to observe direction. Algorithms at this point, indicate a positive gain of 22 cents bringing AAL to close at the end of the trading session around 20.12. Let's hope its wrong and that it closes higher. I will run the algorithms again after 25 minutes of trading to see where they point. The 10 year treasury bonds are down, and oil is slightly up. Good indicators for AAL to move up, but will see where the Hedge Funds are moving us at since the TSA check points are down."
"I just bought some more shares at 18.43. All of my purchases are going to pay big money. It is true that due to Covid 19 virus infecting and killing the unvaccinated, the airport traffic has slow down, but the TSA numbers remain for the month of August 2021 at 77% of what the traffic was for the month of August 2019"
I am buying more shares at this level. Hope it goes to 8 dollars a share so that I can ride it back up to 30 and make a lot of money!!!!
"I still doubt that it will rise, however, I am holding it at the price of 22.28. I would have sold it with a loss, but I changed my mind. I hope it will rise next week."
"Just as predicted, yesterday’s TSA number is slightly below the 2019 same day of week before Labor Day holiday number. Massive number of American’s are vaccinated and becoming vaccinated. Travel will recover sooner than the doomsayers gloomy forecasts. Patience remains a virtue."
Looking at the numbers. American Airlines lost about 20million dollars in passenger revenue yesterday. I am hoping today was a better day. We will know after TSA puts out those figures.
"flying American today, wish me luck!"
"TSA numbers for the weekend above 2million, and above 1.6. for Tuesday. Not bad at all. It signals a healthy recovery."
wen $21?
American Airlines is oversold by 1% against its peers. The 200 SMA is 19.91
"Super Cup & Handles breakout on Uncle's super-long PFE has happened lately, the rally will accelerate...One Day, people will talk about the Airlines and do nothing but smiling...."
Now Pfe vaccine is approve and soon Moderna will also be approve and no longer an emergency uses.Expect air traveler be fully open worldwide.AAL will soon be in my $40 price range.
"When the DOW is Down 268 points, and AAL & the Nasdaq, is Green ........."
Today’s rise is a small step in the proper direction. Four to five dollars higher would be closer to the current intrinsic value of AAL. Future value would be five to eight dollars on top of that.
"Moderna has crazy jump before ER squeezing all the profit at one day.The Dropping will start tomorrow, while the time for Covid-19 Revenge stocks revenge.Tomorrow is good day to go rally back.Today may be the last day to buy the cheap price.$19.5 is the ground. Checked for two days."
This stock would be at 45 bucks if people would stay in it 1 week
Wonder how long the air lines keep it up.
"Very suspicious that all the major Airlines declared lower revenue guidance with negative growth, and they all get the biggest take off in months. In addition, They robbed investors long on the way down, and now, they are robbing shorts on the way up."
"American Airlines is going to be around for a long time. Once the boosters are underway, this will all stabilize and get back to the pre-covid pps range."
"FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja will participate in a virtual fireside chat at the 2021 Raymond James Diversified Industrials Conference Wednesday, Aug. 25, at 8:20 a.m. CT."
So they’re going on strike. Will this affect stock price?
What a Great Entry point ..........
International Travel WAY down. https://www.wesh.com/article/international-travel-orlando-international-down/37377233
"All the airlines stock are oversold, at some point people will realize that there's no perfect situation when all virus has been vanished before people can fly again, what we can do is take the vaccine, wear the mask and live the life as we should be, those who refuse to do that are those who thought can still ask for free handout from government, this cannot last forever."
"It's Not were you Start the Day, it's were you End the Day .............GREEN !!!"
Okie dokie. AAL is bouncing back!
"down today, up next week"
"But the multibillionaire expert posted this....""to all my buddies who are holding short positions, I am happy to sell you premarket at 20.64 my 100, 000 shares I bought yesterday at 20.11 so that you can cover your short."
Real tired of this covid market
"Let's make some money!!! Today, the airlines are going up and TSA numbers are steady holding: Monday, 1.8Million, Sunday 2.0Million travelers. Vaccines at a million for the last 4 days. Best of all, AAL has been beat up so bad that returning to 20.00 is going to happen soon and 25 before the end of October. If you're shorting the Stock a tremendous risk to the upside. On top of that, The airlines received stimulus money to make up for the pandemic losses, and the airlines are getting a handsome payment for moving evacuees from Afghanistan. Not to mention that there is talk of another stimulus money for the Airlines if they need it with forgivable loans. There is no risk in putting money in AAL, and only reward if you are patient to hold it."
Looks like short squeeze is coming soon!!I am telling that because look at the volume from last week and today as well!!Almost double everyday!!!
Look at the volume againShorts are covering their position again Will hit 23-25 next week for sure!!
"Great week everyone, AAL, was green 4 out of 5 days !!!"
I have been buying a lot of AAL shares as it has moved down. It will pay very nicely as it moves up.
Looks like a long term hold
getting impatient with this… drumming up delta and Mu variant
"Airlines made Coordinated Updates/Confessions to Ease investors Fear on COVID-19 effect. This is the Right thing to do, investors love to know exactly what the heck is going on...They should come again in time when there's more doubts going on..."
Big scawwy covid going to rob us of another green day. Stop the fear mongering.
Buy at $19.1
All of my international friends are back in the states. They said 70-80% of the seats are filled. I think that 3q of aal will be strong.
What’s going on with on balance volume going up 4million shares last minutes? Anyone notice?
Can’t stop. Won’t stop!!! Let’s go!
"People Sold on the 10th for Fear, that Weak Joe, and his Wimpy Staff, would see another 9/11. It didn't happen, It's been a Great Weekend(If you watched the Army football Game). Look for American Airlines to go Up on Monday. God Bless America !!!"
"If American had not paid off $950 mil in debt early, the net loss would have been 23 cents a share instead of $1.69/shr. An incredible comeback by any standards. Because of a concerted attack on travel stocks today, the share price is down instead of being up a few dollars where it belongs."
"The market needs time to wake up.The fear of stimulus just concerns the technology stocks.AAL and all flights stocks are recovery stock and undervalued.They gain the benefit in the interest rate increasing.I think the violation is affected by the oil price only.But this is short term, the oil should be $100 on ahead."
"There were 54,728,157 shares volume traded on Friday, AAL was on the top of the most traded shares along with AAPL and AMC that day, the Q3 initial data comes positive yesterday, we all waiting for the F35 take off."
"Prediction: Due to oversold status, directional momentum, and no catalyst to create movement, at closing bell, American Airlines will be in either direction from yesterdays closing 3 to 7 cents. Thus closing at 20.36 to $20.50Make your strategies count!"
"Bye Shorts, Don't forget to write.............."
"Good Morning America!! Premarket, we are up. IDA was downgraded to tropical Storm. Major Damage to the Louisiana refineries will slow down the production of Jet fuel and increase cost in the short run. Covid 19 cases are up with a higher numbers of death people. Of course, vaccinations are also above a million a day. Can we say that the broad market is ignoring the Pandemic? So far futures are all up with 31 broken high records. The TSA numbers for Sunday were even better than pre-pandemic number of flights.Let see where the market takes us today. I think it continues to move up a few cents."
"I would not be too concerned about the European Union banning Americans from visiting Europe. In the wide picture, the insignificant amount of current travel between Europe and America will not make a difference in the revenues of American Airlines. It is already factored in the stock price at 23.15. Use this opportunity to buy cheaper. Hold on to your shares and make very decent money. I am buying at 19.53 and comfortable with it. The rate of infections and vaccinations is moving the needle very fast We are within close distance from achieving Herd Immunity. The Pandemic for all practical purposes, I see the pandemic as irrelevant. Let the Hedge funds play with the price. Just make sure you buy in the low prices. and you can can sell it later at a profit."
back to 18
"With yesterday’s TSA passenger numbers in, there have been four consecutive days of 2 million plus travelers for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Get used to it. COVID will be third page news soon and the travel boom will be first page news. Enjoy the rewards of your patience, longs!"
BUY now.The big discount.The rally path has no change.
Anyone who has been the the airport in last 2 weeks or has a flight in the next month knows -- flights are empty and airlines are cancelling flights left right and center.
"We could mark $25.5-26 as the first target.If ALL climbs slowly to $22 for 3 days, be careful it just needs 2 days to fly to $25.5-26."
August will start a slide down as business travel will also be WAY down. Having the CRO tell the world AUG was bad is a preparation for the next worse news.
pfizer tweets FDA approval
Well we finally closed above the 20 day averages. Next target is the 50 days average of 20.77 which is doable this week
American Airlines has the potential to move down to 19.49. I am buying shares and riding a nice rebound.
"TSA passenger totals top 2 million for the fifth day in a row and the travel stocks drop. When fear is completely disconnected from reality, it’s called a buying opportunity. Stop perpetrating the Delta zombie virus conspiracy and let’s get back to work and play."
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached on TELEG.RAM ( stevewarrenfx ) or on WhatsApp: +1 (813) 683‑ 6310"
"It's very hard to evaluate stocks these days, 2 stocks Uncle doesn't have many shares but Uncle tried to sell for $50 less and failed last time Uncle told about are still going. ALB was $197, TMO was $500."
AAL will tank this week when the results from ALL the cancellations are processed. People are DUMPING trips made 3-6 months ago because of new COVID restrictions which are getting more aggressive by the week. Thoughts?
"Yesterday was ""gift"" people. ""SHOULD HAVE SOLD IT ALL!"""
"The flight stocks are following the oil price this time.They moves not stable this time, following the up and down of oil price."
i gave up and sold. just wont quit dropping
"Uncle really needs the Airlines to Help as the Street is taking profits on the drugs.Let them mandate the vaccination, let people get the 3rd shots, Uncle wants to reverse the PAX after 22-day straight decline on 7-day average. Fly, baby Fly! We're helping evacuating refugees for 2 weeks."
"With all this volume, all I have to say is ............... Welcome Back Warren B. !!!"
"If the drop in share price includes AAL only then we can say this company is experiencing hard times but airlines along with cruises are going up and down together, some of other airline companies have lost more value in share price than AAL, the game is bigger than our predictions."
See how quick AAL went up ..............
"TSA travelers data almost hit the pre-pendamic numbers, holiday seasons just by the corner, will see shorties faces on big screen soon."
"Shorts said, AAL will hit $21, when a Squirrel Water Ski's , Well Short's ...................."
I am buying a lot more shares at this low prices. 19.35 is a bargain.
American Airlines stock is working on a consolidation with a 26.19 buy point. FDA upcoming news will be the game changer.
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"Nothing really to complain about, the Airlines will be boring till they're NOT. The Fact is AAL is still leading all airlines with the Gains this year. +28.79% gain, compared to Doggie DAL which is is Red for the year, regardless their guidance of turning Profit in 4Q on Non-GAAP.The Street continues to chase the Hot Potatoes, too much money concentrated on too few Hot Potatoes, people want Money Today, Right Now, it is kind of dysfunctional, but it is the Game people have to get used to. Uncle believes they're also watching on their punchbowls vert carefully too, it's a Long Long Summer..."
I went LUV over this... still would.
"SAVE made Confession and investors got the message, investors have the Right to know what's going on with the company, whether they're having big disaster after recent chaos and it turned out they're just losing revenue accordingly. Nobody knows what the other airlines are doing, other than LUV giving weak outlook when PAX didn't seem to drop too much. Weird."
"Good price. Lots of millennials investing into AAL, the future is bright AF"
"My break even point is 19.45, so I am taking some risk off the table there and buying more shares as it drops. And if it goes up, I will be making some very decent money."
Gentlemen’s I was traveling with AAL the airport and flight was similar to pre pandemic literally I was amazed
Just added a few more thousands of shares at 20.06. What a great opportunity to make money!!
Airline stocks are down as the European Union recommended Monday that its 27 member states reinstate Covid-related travel restrictions on the U.S.
"We could test the ground of AAL is at $18.3This is very good, all the bad news aroused, AAL could fly again soon."
"AAL, just showed it's hand. It jumped up over 50 cents in a couple min. HF are playing games........."
"New COVID cases are dropping, just as expected. Travel will return just as predicted. Patience will reward longs."
What are some of y’all’s realistic price target by end of year based on whatever fundamental or hyabusa handles that you use?Real talk.(Trolling kept to min. Please *ahem @coyoteclit)
I picked up more shares at 19.49
"LOL! Market rarely makes sense. AAL is going to be picketed, so there's labor unrest AND all airlines are downgrading revenue forecasts----so AAL goes up 7%. Makes perfect sense."
"The 7-Day moving Average of the PAX number has been declining for 15 days in a row since beginning of August, It's about 6.72%."
"Excellent buy point, will see you all 30...very soon"
Airlines have been getting lower highs and lower lows since June 2nd! Now winter is coming!
Gentlemen’s mark my words tomorrow will be unforgettable day
15% of the whole number of shares go to shorties but they still can manipulate the share price.
"All recovery stocks are lower per-market, this drop of AAL stock price might not has anything to do with earning report. Bottom line is AAL beats, this is good news, the stock price might get suppressed now but will probably go up"
The new algorithms indicated a possible low of 19.36. I will be a buyer at those levels and ride up to a nice profit.
"Yesterday AAL went down to $19.01, then shot up to $20.60, all you have to do is .........."
Finally a nice little take off!
"I bought at $30 pre-pandemic and just sold $20.30 a couple of weeks ago. I lost over $100K. This stock is going no where with all the variants. Warren Buffet was right, business travel will never return. Don’t waste time, invest in other stocks that actually go up in value. I already made half of my money back."
"where are all the short sellers, beautiful day for them :)"
"Jab mandate is not going to get me flying any time, except Luv"
"They are milking Delta Variant to get stocks to the bottom rates, until vast majority of share holders will start taking PTSD medication :)"
"It should be very obvious that there may be a little slow down in air travel, but there will be no lockdowns. Thus, I love it when it drops because it becomes a buying opportunity with lots of money to be made.LOL!!!"
"ATTENTION gullible dummies: There will be NO STRIKE!!! Under the Railway Labor Act, airline employees must participate in a lengthy mediation process expressly designed to force a resolution before they can strike. If mediation fails, the president may order a 60-day cooling-off period–during which airline workers must return to work–if he feels a strike would substantially disrupt the national transportation system. If this fails, Congress may force both sides to accept a settlement, or may extend the cooling-off period indefinitely. This is what happened to American Airlines pilots two years ago: President Clinton ordered the cooling-off period four minutes after they went on strike, and they were forced to accept a settlement."
They had some interesting insights about AAL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"American Airlines is oversold against the competition. So far I am green in the account for todays trading, and I will be adding more shares around 19.40 and lower."
"Clearly oversold. Just as it did in the UK and India, the Delta strain will die out quickly. The cooler weather of Fall will return, sending more people on warmer climate excursions. Then comes the Holiday season where those that skipped holiday travel last year will return in droves. The future looks bright for the travel industry to return to better than pre-COVID levels. My loved ones will be ecstatic with my generosity this Xmas from proceeds from AAL!"
HOOOOLD THE BAGBK is NEAR <333$DAL $AAL $UAL $SAVE $JETS $JBLU $ALK
"There is no business travel, no international travel. Until we do, you have to discount about 23% off pre-pandemic levels. 23% is the portion of travel and profits that is missing from the picture right now. So the price of this stage is about 23.15/share. We are undervalue by 3.40. At 18.15 it was way undervalue in a crazy way by 5 dollars/share. In addition, 77% travel is in place, enough to keep AAL and the other airlines afloat from bankruptcy. The worst for the airline industry is in the past as far as Covid is concern. Focus on the future of the airlines."
"When it comes to AAL going to $25+, Just .........."
bought several thousand shares at 20.32. Good money to be made from that entry point.
"This is the morning of Covid-19 affected stock, no reason to sell."
When to the moon?
Pfizer approval should bode well for airlines
"Well.. everyone longs and shorts, I hope your day today was a money making day. There is a lot of money to be made with AAL. The month of August had below expectation sales. It does not mean it was a bad month. That is why the stock is up. In addition, the covid is not deciding factor. It has some effect, but as long as people keep flying, money is coming in. Yesterday TSA numbers were up to 1.8million. Most likely the weekend rebounds above 2 million. The only real story here is airlines are flying people. Vaccinations are at 1 million a day. Trying to continue to go against the facts will hurt you if you don't time your shorts. Thank you, and have a great weekend."
"What do you good people feel about the extra unemployment benefits boost that just ended. Yes, unemployment was a problem but now people will be looking for work again. A boost to the economy? But before the boost a little dip in the numbers?"
"Typical long weekend jitters. When you see the growing passenger numbers over the Labor Day weekend, you will get a true picture of the massive potential of this and other travel stocks."
"Canada relaxs travel restriction starting from tomorrow. More airports will be open for international airlines too. AAL, DAL and more plan to add more flights soon."
"Based on TSA data, passenger throughput has maintained a trend of constant improving in the past 8 months, which may reach/overlap with pre-pandemic levels after a couple of weeks in September or in October."
"I am making some serious money. With all of the shares I bought at the low prices of yesterday and today, I am bringing in some serious cash to my trading account. So I took some risk off the table at 20.01"
"The simple truth is that discouraging reports about the pandemic causes travel stocks to fall and encouraging reports cause them to rise. As soon as the Delta hype subsides, you will see a dramatic share price increase. Stay healthy and wait for the rebound."
"I should put a disclaimer here. I was sick with Covid last year in August and it almost killed me. I still suffer with complications from that event. I became fully vaccinated in January, and I am planning to get the Covid antibody booster shot."
"The market in general was more green last year than now, we see reddish market almost everyday."
"If you guys look at the airlines, except for AAL, they are all green. The risk to the upside is much greater than the risk to the downside. The further it goes down the harder it becomes to justify the lower price and the down trend to the level that the company book price is greater than the stock price. At that point everyone jumps in to buy."
"Life is Good, Uncle's holding most of the pharma stocks got rewarded dearly, especially Today. Uncle's Holding most of the Airlines, though taking the backseats due to the fact that all of them will continue to lose money this quarter, will shine into 2022 nd beyond too. Stock market is a waiting game, Tide always goes in and out, it's NOT the Strongest who will last but only those who have the patient to last to the last moment are the Strongest. Airlines are Boring, they're still allow to Pop here and there, Today's just another Boring day.Uncle's High-techs are good too, but not Great, it's also boring since you know they'll continue to rally without extra excitement."
"All four yahoo indicator are red, therefore it's a buy."
$WIMI $AAL $NOK Loading the boat on any weakness..! Watching this high conviction play daily
 Been trading AAL for about 15 months.. I have had nothing but success. Great company & great SP.
Delta airline is now implementing a $200 per month for each employee that do not take vaccine and soon every airline will do the same.
"This is a bargain and a guaranteed win at this price !Anything under $20 will double just hold onto it!AA will be making money just as it did before ,people have to fly and travel , also JBLU is also a bargain but you,ll make more with American ! buy ...buy....buy....and hold!"
The funds are obviously suppressing AAL today. Come on Redditers and teach them a lesson.
Since the Broad Market continues to move up. It is reasonable to assume that the laggards will move up to catch up. American Airlines being a laggard with such a little chance of loan default or bankruptcy becomes a greater buying opportunity that will deliver incredible gains to those who load up at this levels.
"TSA numbers for September 2nd are back up to 1.9 million with AAL transporting about 366,700 passengers. IDA caused flight cancellations yesterday but it was minimum disruptions. US Futures are up in anticipation of the jobs number today expected to have solid growth. Europe and Asia are a mixed bag. Covid infections have reached its peak and now are in decline so the numbers for the Airlines should start looking better next week. Let's make some money!!"
Yes. double confirmation the ground.AAL will rise to $23.5 as the first target.
back in at 19.50
"Clearly oversold. The economy will not on lockdown again. We are over prepared for Delta. Ppl are getting forced to be vaccinated left and right. International travel is gonna be opened back soon. If there is a time to load up, its now!"
"The 81 RS Rating means that Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines stock price is outperforming 81% of all stocks. Market research shows that stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an RS Rating north of 80 as they begin their biggest climbs."
Allegiant and Frontier sold alcohol through the whole pandemic....no fights or issues.....American just doesn't get it.....let the people drink to take the edge off and relax
Gentlemen’s load and hold tomorrow will be tremendous day Enshallah
"Sub 18 soon, stop dreaming about 20+"
"Today, was a great buying opportunity, I loaded at 18.38 and still buying at 18.50. We are going to make so much money is not even funny. Laughing all the way to the bank. Yeah!!!"
