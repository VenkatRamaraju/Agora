"Buy'em while you can people, We will close the week, between $21.50 and $22."
"Load up on AAL, before it brakes $20, because it's Not coming back down .............."
Since the Broad Market continues to move up. It is reasonable to assume that the laggards will move up to catch up. American Airlines being a laggard with such a little chance of loan default or bankruptcy becomes a greater buying opportunity that will deliver incredible gains to those who load up at this levels.
"Shorts said, AAL will hit $21, when a Squirrel Water Ski's , Well Short's ...................."
"I would not be too concerned about the European Union banning Americans from visiting Europe. In the wide picture, the insignificant amount of current travel between Europe and America will not make a difference in the revenues of American Airlines. It is already factored in the stock price at 23.15. Use this opportunity to buy cheaper. Hold on to your shares and make very decent money. I am buying at 19.53 and comfortable with it. The rate of infections and vaccinations is moving the needle very fast We are within close distance from achieving Herd Immunity. The Pandemic for all practical purposes, I see the pandemic as irrelevant. Let the Hedge funds play with the price. Just make sure you buy in the low prices. and you can can sell it later at a profit."
"It should be very obvious that there may be a little slow down in air travel, but there will be no lockdowns. Thus, I love it when it drops because it becomes a buying opportunity with lots of money to be made.LOL!!!"
A new momentum is taking place. Soon above 20.00
AAL is fully book all flight in and out of Vegas.Especially from Houston to Vegas and back.
"170k+ shares shorted after market, this stock is toast.$17 here we go <3"
American Airlines has the potential to move down to 19.49. I am buying shares and riding a nice rebound.
"where are all the short sellers, beautiful day for them :)"
"This is a bargain and a guaranteed win at this price !Anything under $20 will double just hold onto it!AA will be making money just as it did before ,people have to fly and travel , also JBLU is also a bargain but you,ll make more with American ! buy ...buy....buy....and hold!"
"EU bans US travel, have to live with this downturn for another few weeks, long term, no impact"
"Clearly oversold. The economy will not on lockdown again. We are over prepared for Delta. Ppl are getting forced to be vaccinated left and right. International travel is gonna be opened back soon. If there is a time to load up, its now!"
"Let's make some money!!! Today, the airlines are going up and TSA numbers are steady holding: Monday, 1.8Million, Sunday 2.0Million travelers. Vaccines at a million for the last 4 days. Best of all, AAL has been beat up so bad that returning to 20.00 is going to happen soon and 25 before the end of October. If you're shorting the Stock a tremendous risk to the upside. On top of that, The airlines received stimulus money to make up for the pandemic losses, and the airlines are getting a handsome payment for moving evacuees from Afghanistan. Not to mention that there is talk of another stimulus money for the Airlines if they need it with forgivable loans. There is no risk in putting money in AAL, and only reward if you are patient to hold it."
Gentlemen’s I was traveling with AAL the airport and flight was similar to pre pandemic literally I was amazed
I manage to scoop a few shares at 19.58. I have been loading up. This is a buying opportunity that will make money.
"Great week everyone, AAL, was green 4 out of 5 days !!!"
"Yesterday I bought 5000 at 19.51 and today I bought 5000 more at 20, I will sit down to wait for the profits drinking a glass of good red wine ,,,, stop below 19.50 at closing"
Therefore I just bought couple airlines stocks I believe it is on the right direction
Now Pfe vaccine is approve and soon Moderna will also be approve and no longer an emergency uses.Expect air traveler be fully open worldwide.AAL will soon be in my $40 price range.
"Good Morning America!! Premarket, we are up. IDA was downgraded to tropical Storm. Major Damage to the Louisiana refineries will slow down the production of Jet fuel and increase cost in the short run. Covid 19 cases are up with a higher numbers of death people. Of course, vaccinations are also above a million a day. Can we say that the broad market is ignoring the Pandemic? So far futures are all up with 31 broken high records. The TSA numbers for Sunday were even better than pre-pandemic number of flights.Let see where the market takes us today. I think it continues to move up a few cents."
$AAL $UAL $DAL every chart is exactly the same. So NONE of this is about the companies. Only about overarching narratives and sentiment. So we are trading emotional fake scare swings.
American Airlines stock is working on a consolidation with a 26.19 buy point. FDA upcoming news will be the game changer.
Planes were empty on the long hauls (where AAL makes the most money) CFO said August numbers are terrible and likely Q3 and Q4 will look bad as the COVID DELTA variation again stops travel. Business travel and budgets have be slashed for 2022 because COVID shutdowns proved it was not needed to do well (hello zoom) -- it will be a very bad year for AAL.
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.

"FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja will participate in a virtual fireside chat at the 2021 Raymond James Diversified Industrials Conference Wednesday, Aug. 25, at 8:20 a.m. CT."
"There is no business travel, no international travel. Until we do, you have to discount about 23% off pre-pandemic levels. 23% is the portion of travel and profits that is missing from the picture right now. So the price of this stage is about 23.15/share. We are undervalue by 3.40. At 18.15 it was way undervalue in a crazy way by 5 dollars/share. In addition, 77% travel is in place, enough to keep AAL and the other airlines afloat from bankruptcy. The worst for the airline industry is in the past as far as Covid is concern. Focus on the future of the airlines."
"Clearly oversold. Just as it did in the UK and India, the Delta strain will die out quickly. The cooler weather of Fall will return, sending more people on warmer climate excursions. Then comes the Holiday season where those that skipped holiday travel last year will return in droves. The future looks bright for the travel industry to return to better than pre-COVID levels. My loved ones will be ecstatic with my generosity this Xmas from proceeds from AAL!"
"Monday is a Good day to watch, over sold AAL, go to the Moon ............"
How can AAL is the only airline stock that still red today?
lots of volume for AAL. Is that supposed to mean money is moving in?
"As I worked for 1 of the big 3, Airline stocks are never great, but this is a no brainer, AA trading low, post COVID bookings are already skyhigh. Normally I would say stay AAway, but this will be an ex money maker"
"All the airlines stock are oversold, at some point people will realize that there's no perfect situation when all virus has been vanished before people can fly again, what we can do is take the vaccine, wear the mask and live the life as we should be, those who refuse to do that are those who thought can still ask for free handout from government, this cannot last forever."
1 wk gain = 1 hr lossBS stock!!!
Again record travel more than 2019 without international .And HF MF bring the hold sector down
"To Everyone, that bought AAL, and Didn't Panic sale ............."
