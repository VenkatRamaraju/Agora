"FDA Approves Vaccinations for Kids, Look for a Boost in Travel Stocks !!!"
I don't think that AAL has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
TSA travel data shows traffic has increased to 15% off the 2019 traffic !! The pessimists were expecting 25% off the 2019 traffic. AAl was manipulated downward by Goldman Sach with its downgrade call to benefit its trading position. SEC must investigate . Govt should ban trading and analyst report business by the same company for conflict of interests. This cannot be safeguarded or overseighted.
"The travel demand is very high right now, and it will continue all the way until end of next year, the only thing that pull back all airlines stock is just the fuel price - it's more like an excuse for the analyst to cast a gloomy future for airlines stock, airlines company will hedge fuel price for sure, they are not first day in business. Besides, fuel price is something that government can interfere, this is not pandemic, OPEC has to do something about it. $AAL $UAL $DAL are all in bargain price now, buy at this price and just hold on to it, and you will have handsome return next year."
aa cargo earrings double this year due to demand. all over fox business news.
"""Every single year for the past 5 years the airlines ETF Jets and other airline companies have ran up in November. This time there's also a massive catalyst on November 8th as the International travel ban is lifted in the US. Warning sent."" https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1453883632838402139?s=20$JETS $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $BA $ALK"
"So I don't own AAL shares, but I own shares in the travel sector, (NCLH) Why is AAL the only airlines that is going straight down today? Most travel sector stocks have been slowly gaining back since mid day, and just swapped over to AAL and it's at LOD. Is there some news on it? The earnings report seemed positive."
"Let put it this way, the fuel cost rise because the demand is high, demand is high because border has been re-opened soon and people eager to fly, that's also means airlines company is selling more tickets and the business is good. So why is it a bad thing? Does market hope for fuel price is low due to supply over demand? That suppose to prop the stock price? Btw, minimum wages is increasing, money is printing, people are now asking for 4th stimulus check, child tax credit, strike all over country asking for higher pay and benefits, the government keep pouring money into the economy - remember 3.5 trillions spending plan? All commodity cost is inflated and you expect oil to stay low? Once people realize oil price hike is inevitable, all airlines stock will roaring back. $UAL $AAL $ DAL"
Looks like is getting ready to reverse higher - buy and hold from here. Still holding 6000 shares along with my 1500 shares in Macys
"Today, all airlines stocks are down. This is because all short term/retail groups are leaving. All Airlines stock will move up as usual steadily. AAL has a strong plan to pay off dept by 2025. Please note we are talking about the world's largest airline (AAL). So stay calm, dont be tracked by these shortie's messages in this forum."
"With all the flight cancellations at the last minute why should anyone buy in advance? American Airlines just cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before departure. I have non refundable expenses for auto rental and hotel, not to mention meeting up with other people. Lesson learned. I could have drove but decided to fly for a short trip, 650 miles or so. Had I known this was going to happen I would have drove. If airlines are no longer a reliable and dependable source for travel that means more people will choose the driving route. I can only imagine how messed up Thanksgiving and Christmas is going to be."
"FDA approved under 12 vaccine with 17-0 votes. CDC will approve next week, no question about that. This means family vacations bookings starts."
"So far they're all down after reporting earnings and guiding below consensus estimate for 4Q.We have the Hawaiian Airlines reporting after market, the Street doesn't seem to care much if they make or break. Any positive reaction to their earning will be Good for other airlines. This is the Airlines that hedged Jet Fuel to Report earnings, other than ALK and LUV."
"They're looking for Weak Hands to fold, then a late afternoon pop, and Up $1.00+ on Monday. I've seen it to many times. AAL has nothing but GOOD News. They Beat all estimates, and Travel is Up, what's not to like. HODL Strong, and be Rewarded !!!!"
"The risk to reward for airlines at these levels is amazing, incoming catalysts below:- Massive influx of demand on November 8th as international travel ban is lifted by the US- Holiday season demand will be higher than usual as many weren't able to travel last holiday season- Oil prices have peaked short-term and is beginning to downtrend a bit- As demand increases pricing power of ticket prices will combat elevated oil costs.$DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $JETS $BA"
"TSA Numbers are 81% of the 2019 numbers on Friday, and 84% of the 2019 Numbers for Saturday. Which are up 215% from 2020. 2,594,337 people flew on Friday. AAL BEAT all estimates, and Made a Profit last quarter. It's Vacation Season, and the Airlines are primed for recovery. Look for an Up Week !!"
"Long Week, but it went Strong into the Close, and Closed Green. Should be a Great Monday. Have a Great Weekend Everybody !!!"
$12B market cap$41B debt???????tough to be in the airlines business
Got back from Hawaii two weeks ago and just booked a December Florida trip this afternoon. Went to Vegas in May. All flights on American. Every flight I have been on this year has been full or pretty close and the airports are quite busy. Just a matter of time before the numbers catch up with the reality that lots and lots of people are perfectly comfortable with flying again.
High season coming
