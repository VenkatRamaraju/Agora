$40 is target.100%+Who follows?
Gentlemen’s I was traveling with AAL the airport and flight was similar to pre pandemic literally I was amazed
"It's Not were you start the day, It's were you end ..............GREEN !!!!"
A doctor on CNN today indicated that American airlines precautions for protecting people against Covid are really great. He singled out AAL above all other airlines. This has to translate to AAL being the wisest choice for people who fly.
"Moderna has crazy jump before ER squeezing all the profit at one day.The Dropping will start tomorrow, while the time for Covid-19 Revenge stocks revenge.Tomorrow is good day to go rally back.Today may be the last day to buy the cheap price.$19.5 is the ground. Checked for two days."
AAL gonna raise the roof baby!!!
"American Airlines is going to be around for a long time. Once the boosters are underway, this will all stabilize and get back to the pre-covid pps range."
I am buying more shares at this level. Hope it goes to 8 dollars a share so that I can ride it back up to 30 and make a lot of money!!!!

The 6 Best Up & Coming Stocks To Buy Right Now! For details https://youtu.be/UyYUmQW9WJU
i gave up and sold. just wont quit dropping
"American Airlines (AAL) topped second-quarter earnings views while Southwest Airlines (LUV) reported results, as both carriers reported improving metrics such as cash build. AAL stock and LUV stock fell."" Even on very red days remember you are holding a winner!"
"American Airlines Group Inc (AAL) Q2 21 (USD): EPS -1.69 ex-items (exp. -1.96), Revenue 7.5bln (exp. 7.34bln)."
AAL is currently traded at 20% discount as compare to a high of $25.00
Yes. double confirmation the ground.AAL will rise to $23.5 as the first target.
Real tired of this covid market
"They are milking Delta Variant to get stocks to the bottom rates, until vast majority of share holders will start taking PTSD medication :)"
Money shifting from tech to air and financial sectors for long term
July and August will be travel boom. people will travel to cooler places.. CCL and AAL will sky rocket to $30
$30 by March
Just added a few more thousands of shares at 20.06. What a great opportunity to make money!!
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached on TELEG.RAM ( stevewarrenfx ) or on WhatsApp: +1 (813) 683‑ 6310"
"With yesterday’s TSA passenger numbers in, there have been four consecutive days of 2 million plus travelers for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Get used to it. COVID will be third page news soon and the travel boom will be first page news. Enjoy the rewards of your patience, longs!"
"July 6 (Reuters) – American Airlines said on Tuesday it carried nearly 2.7 million customers on more than 26,000 flights from July 1 through July 5 – nearly three times the passengers it carried in 2020.The U.S. air carrier flew more than twice as many flights over the five-day period this year versus 2020 including combined mainline and regional flights as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19.""After a challenging year, this weekend proved that people are ready to travel again and that the American team stands ready to deliver,"" American chief operating officer David Seymour said in the memo to employees seen by Reuters."
Why no quips from Richard today?
wen $21?
Yeap!! 19.91 and I am getting ready to buy starting at 19.86. Who is with me? Let's make some money together.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/statement-american-airlines-civil-air-213105110.html
"A lot of people traveling right now.I’m returning home from Yosemite.Got folks from Texas, Florida, Washington and Arizona visiting.Idk if Europe is open to travel to US right now but I noticed a lot of people from European descent as well"
"market too volatile and risky, especially for airline stocks with the new delta mess."
"Yesterday, TSA numbers above 2million, and domestic flying going strong for AAL."
"This is the morning of Covid-19 affected stock, no reason to sell."
Therefore I just bought couple airlines stocks I believe it is on the right direction
"The simple truth is that discouraging reports about the pandemic causes travel stocks to fall and encouraging reports cause them to rise. As soon as the Delta hype subsides, you will see a dramatic share price increase. Stay healthy and wait for the rebound."
"Down 100% trying to squash open options for tomorrow. It's no longer INVESTING, it's manipulation."
Okie dokie. AAL is bouncing back!
"So, of the 34 million cases of COVID so far in the United States, there have been approximately 607 thousand deaths. That is a mortality rate of 1.7 percent. To me, the biggest problem is this country’s high level of co-morbidities. Maybe, if the general populous were to stop over eating and stop eating so much sugar and stop supporting GMO foods and pesticide use, we would have stronger immune systems and significantly lower deaths. COVID is NOT the problem here!"
"I just bought some more shares at 18.43. All of my purchases are going to pay big money. It is true that due to Covid 19 virus infecting and killing the unvaccinated, the airport traffic has slow down, but the TSA numbers remain for the month of August 2021 at 77% of what the traffic was for the month of August 2019"
Pfizer approval should bode well for airlines
Going back to $28 soon. I’m buying
"170k+ shares shorted after market, this stock is toast.$17 here we go <3"
300 flights cancelled due to pilot shortage. My flight was one of them.
"I would not be too concerned about the European Union banning Americans from visiting Europe. In the wide picture, the insignificant amount of current travel between Europe and America will not make a difference in the revenues of American Airlines. It is already factored in the stock price at 23.15. Use this opportunity to buy cheaper. Hold on to your shares and make very decent money. I am buying at 19.53 and comfortable with it. The rate of infections and vaccinations is moving the needle very fast We are within close distance from achieving Herd Immunity. The Pandemic for all practical purposes, I see the pandemic as irrelevant. Let the Hedge funds play with the price. Just make sure you buy in the low prices. and you can can sell it later at a profit."
Today’s rise is a small step in the proper direction. Four to five dollars higher would be closer to the current intrinsic value of AAL. Future value would be five to eight dollars on top of that.
"""When people are selling, I'm buying"" ~~~ W. Buffett"
"Great week everyone, AAL, was green 4 out of 5 days !!!"
"All recovery stocks are lower per-market, this drop of AAL stock price might not has anything to do with earning report. Bottom line is AAL beats, this is good news, the stock price might get suppressed now but will probably go up"
"I still doubt that it will rise, however, I am holding it at the price of 22.28. I would have sold it with a loss, but I changed my mind. I hope it will rise next week."
"What is amazing in this horrible game is that you can’t make predictions based on facts, the share price hit $29 premarket back in January before announcing the distribution of the vaccine, now we see miserable share rates after vaccinating almost 60% of the nation, what a dirty game."
I knew the sector would tank who on their right minds wouldGo near a plane or airport… my one day old 19 ours are really gaining traction now ….. this was a pure news cycle put
"To our shorts out there. I hope you guys are not holding hopes of this stock going under 19.00 again. Everything is possible, but if AAL hits under 19 again, I will buy like crazy. There is no way that another great buying opportunity like that presents again."
"Watch the volumes. Like clock work the shorts and/or those NEEDING the price under $20 keep DUMPING/spiking volume trying to drive it down. These people are the equivalent to the antifa/blm mobs that raid stores... each running out with a pair of shoes or televisions that they really didn't earn but were able to steal from PRODUCTIVE Americans because they rush in as a mob. Certainly not real investors, they build nothing, they create nothing, they are nothing. The worst America has to offer. This has nothing to do with value."
What are some of y’all’s realistic price target by end of year based on whatever fundamental or hyabusa handles that you use?Real talk.(Trolling kept to min. Please *ahem @coyoteclit)
Shorts now racing to buyback before the clock runs out....love it.
"All the airlines stock are oversold, at some point people will realize that there's no perfect situation when all virus has been vanished before people can fly again, what we can do is take the vaccine, wear the mask and live the life as we should be, those who refuse to do that are those who thought can still ask for free handout from government, this cannot last forever."
Strong ER will climb 10% tomorrow.Buy and hold AAL
Doesnt the new infrastructure bill that just passed the senate have money to revamp airports?
"Good Morning America!! Premarket, we are up. IDA was downgraded to tropical Storm. Major Damage to the Louisiana refineries will slow down the production of Jet fuel and increase cost in the short run. Covid 19 cases are up with a higher numbers of death people. Of course, vaccinations are also above a million a day. Can we say that the broad market is ignoring the Pandemic? So far futures are all up with 31 broken high records. The TSA numbers for Sunday were even better than pre-pandemic number of flights.Let see where the market takes us today. I think it continues to move up a few cents."
"Looks like the #$%$ shorts won this week, hopefully they get torched next week"
AAL is fully book all flight in and out of Vegas.Especially from Houston to Vegas and back.
"If you guys look at the airlines, except for AAL, they are all green. The risk to the upside is much greater than the risk to the downside. The further it goes down the harder it becomes to justify the lower price and the down trend to the level that the company book price is greater than the stock price. At that point everyone jumps in to buy."
"Everyone knows full well that they are requiring to wear mask on the plane but they went ahead paying for the ticket and act upon the plane by refuse to wear a mask!! Finally, got kick-off without refund and some even forbidding to fly every again plus penalty? Is it worst it for such attention and or for such publicity stunt?These people must have nothing better to do in life besides getting on the plane to disrupt everyone's life."
"TSA passenger totals top 2 million for the fifth day in a row and the travel stocks drop. When fear is completely disconnected from reality, it’s called a buying opportunity. Stop perpetrating the Delta zombie virus conspiracy and let’s get back to work and play."
Looks like a long term hold
"Here goes FAANG again...Some Sectors have been totally abandoned for now, people are busy cooking some old stuff. God bless Apple and the whole Supply Chain."
What just happened??? Blew my mind
Low volume and a higher share price is an extremely bullish indicator for AAL.
"hello i sold heavy on Monday because wall street told me the delta virus is coming, and has the virus gone today? so many buys."
"According to my computer algorithms. AAL has the potential, at this moment 20.28, to move all the way up to 20.69 or down to 19.51 with a closing value of 20.01"
"Prediction: Due to oversold status, directional momentum, and no catalyst to create movement, at closing bell, American Airlines will be in either direction from yesterdays closing 3 to 7 cents. Thus closing at 20.36 to $20.50Make your strategies count!"
Planes were empty on the long hauls (where AAL makes the most money) CFO said August numbers are terrible and likely Q3 and Q4 will look bad as the COVID DELTA variation again stops travel. Business travel and budgets have be slashed for 2022 because COVID shutdowns proved it was not needed to do well (hello zoom) -- it will be a very bad year for AAL.
Do you realize that AAL UAL DAL CCL NCLH are now much cheaper to buy then during the height of the pandemic. This is pure manipulation!
Since the Broad Market continues to move up. It is reasonable to assume that the laggards will move up to catch up. American Airlines being a laggard with such a little chance of loan default or bankruptcy becomes a greater buying opportunity that will deliver incredible gains to those who load up at this levels.
"Bought 1330 more shares @ 19.48, Thanks for the Gift!!"
Well we finally closed above the 20 day averages. Next target is the 50 days average of 20.77 which is doable this week
"Remember, Paper hands, fly on Paper Planes. HODL !!!"
Lets dance for a green week!
what constantly worries me about AAL is the high debt level 30 bil.
Wishing you could successfully escape today! This downtrend is due to worrisome future ahead for AAL! Too much head winds!
"$50 by summer 2022, with no sweat...just wait and see"
"The 81 RS Rating means that Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines stock price is outperforming 81% of all stocks. Market research shows that stocks that go on to make the biggest gains often have an RS Rating north of 80 as they begin their biggest climbs."
"SAVE made Confession and investors got the message, investors have the Right to know what's going on with the company, whether they're having big disaster after recent chaos and it turned out they're just losing revenue accordingly. Nobody knows what the other airlines are doing, other than LUV giving weak outlook when PAX didn't seem to drop too much. Weird."
All airline are adding 30% capacity over 2019 schedule.
$23 tomorrow?
What a Great Entry point ..........
I heard about AAL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Why is only AAL and Spirit experiencing all these cancellations we are hearing about?
Waiting on $17's before any buys and only taking a position bc when market corrects so will AAL most likely revisiting $14's.
"Monday is a Good day to watch, over sold AAL, go to the Moon ............"
"Uncle really needs the Airlines to Help as the Street is taking profits on the drugs.Let them mandate the vaccination, let people get the 3rd shots, Uncle wants to reverse the PAX after 22-day straight decline on 7-day average. Fly, baby Fly! We're helping evacuating refugees for 2 weeks."
$WIMI $AAL $NOK Loading the boat on any weakness..! Watching this high conviction play daily
"This stock trades at $19.95. And to be honest I’m extremely bullish. Target price: $24. That gives the stock 20% upside. Wall Street as well is bullish. Many analysts even the bearish ones are bumping up target prices. Huge demand for travel and covid delta variant ain’t stopping no one have you see Disney, Las Vegas, and cruises. Their partying. Invest rn. You won’t regret it I just picked up another 200 shares let’s go BABYYY"
Big scawwy covid going to rob us of another green day. Stop the fear mongering.
"My family and I traveled this weekend on AA. Four planes round trip. All flights were full and running on-time for the most part. Everything went smoothly for us.Big difference I noticed is having to pay to reserve a seat. Cost $25-$30/seat and per plane. So, if you have 1 or two layovers you need to pay for each flight. Cost another $450 for the entire trip just to reserve seats so my family could stay together...bit of a racket in my opinion. Not sure how long that will continue but it must be adding to the bottom line."
What’s going on with on balance volume going up 4million shares last minutes? Anyone notice?
"Clearly oversold. The economy will not on lockdown again. We are over prepared for Delta. Ppl are getting forced to be vaccinated left and right. International travel is gonna be opened back soon. If there is a time to load up, its now!"
united airlines and delta airlines in red now american at least in green good sign
"Nothing really to complain about, the Airlines will be boring till they're NOT. The Fact is AAL is still leading all airlines with the Gains this year. +28.79% gain, compared to Doggie DAL which is is Red for the year, regardless their guidance of turning Profit in 4Q on Non-GAAP.The Street continues to chase the Hot Potatoes, too much money concentrated on too few Hot Potatoes, people want Money Today, Right Now, it is kind of dysfunctional, but it is the Game people have to get used to. Uncle believes they're also watching on their punchbowls vert carefully too, it's a Long Long Summer..."
The AAL ER came positive but the bosses in the wall street have different agenda today
"Now that the airline earnings are out and they are mostly positive and forecasts are rosy, the big funds will be selling down to remove stops from weak hands before buying back at deflated prices for the impending run up."
"Buy'em while you can people, We will close the week, between $21.50 and $22."
AAL may move higher as UAL reports earnings
I went LUV over this... still would.
"For Long term players, you could hold till $40, sleep for a month and no need to concern the process.For Mid-term players, you could hold AAL till $25.5-$26, sometimes, it could break a little bit to $26.8(but not sure.)For Short term players, I believe AAL still has a power to taste nearly $22.8-23.5 in the coming 1 or 2 days."
"Clearly oversold. Just as it did in the UK and India, the Delta strain will die out quickly. The cooler weather of Fall will return, sending more people on warmer climate excursions. Then comes the Holiday season where those that skipped holiday travel last year will return in droves. The future looks bright for the travel industry to return to better than pre-COVID levels. My loved ones will be ecstatic with my generosity this Xmas from proceeds from AAL!"
"All four yahoo indicator are red, therefore it's a buy."
Now Pfe vaccine is approve and soon Moderna will also be approve and no longer an emergency uses.Expect air traveler be fully open worldwide.AAL will soon be in my $40 price range.
"Canada relaxs travel restriction starting from tomorrow. More airports will be open for international airlines too. AAL, DAL and more plan to add more flights soon."
What a GREAT buying opportunity !!
Airlines are starting to make profits now and positive cash flows so unsure why the selling
August will start a slide down as business travel will also be WAY down. Having the CRO tell the world AUG was bad is a preparation for the next worse news.
pfizer tweets FDA approval
"Buying calls and shares here, this will easily beat Q2 earnings and go up a few dollars at the least by next week. This is just more hysteria. Interestingly enough it seems that those countries that have the higher vaccination rates are having higher cases per Capita . What a boring dystopia we live in"
"I loaded with a couple of thousand shares at $19.36. This is a great buying opportunity. Thanks to all those who refuse to wear face masks, not get vaccinated, becoming infected with the Covid Delta variant, and unfortunately dying as a result of the Covid infection... you make a great buying opportunity for us investors and traders of Airlines."
"Just bought 3K shares guys, Cramer said that airlines and cruise lines stocks will rise towards the end of this year and earlier next year! GLTA Filled Buy 3000 AAL Market 21.5375 -- -- 10:30:58 07/22/21"
"Yesterday’s clearance sale is over, but AAL is still selling at 25 percent off."
"Let's make some money!!! Today, the airlines are going up and TSA numbers are steady holding: Monday, 1.8Million, Sunday 2.0Million travelers. Vaccines at a million for the last 4 days. Best of all, AAL has been beat up so bad that returning to 20.00 is going to happen soon and 25 before the end of October. If you're shorting the Stock a tremendous risk to the upside. On top of that, The airlines received stimulus money to make up for the pandemic losses, and the airlines are getting a handsome payment for moving evacuees from Afghanistan. Not to mention that there is talk of another stimulus money for the Airlines if they need it with forgivable loans. There is no risk in putting money in AAL, and only reward if you are patient to hold it."
AAL Debt service (interest expense) is on track to double from 900m to over $1.8B by the end of this year. Losses will be sustained and debt will only grow as time goest on. AAL needs to declare bankruptcy and restructure themselves.
"Today, was a great buying opportunity, I loaded at 18.38 and still buying at 18.50. We are going to make so much money is not even funny. Laughing all the way to the bank. Yeah!!!"
"Looks like volume isn’t there today, so the usual sell tactics by the big funds is happening. They would love to have your shares at these depressed levels. Imagine the joy you’d bring them if you sold and they make millions when the imminent price rise happens. Don’t be duped."
"FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) Chief Revenue Officer Vasu Raja will participate in a virtual fireside chat at the 2021 Raymond James Diversified Industrials Conference Wednesday, Aug. 25, at 8:20 a.m. CT."
"Reading the Tea Leaves, close on Friday, between $21.50 and $22.00"
Volume looks better today. Someone is waking up!
"If American had not paid off $950 mil in debt early, the net loss would have been 23 cents a share instead of $1.69/shr. An incredible comeback by any standards. Because of a concerted attack on travel stocks today, the share price is down instead of being up a few dollars where it belongs."
"We could test the ground of AAL is at $18.3This is very good, all the bad news aroused, AAL could fly again soon."
"I see September as a banner month for air travel. As the Delta hype dies down this month and the kiddies are back in school, the adults will be in control and looking to travel. Business travel should pick up then also."
"They got a tax payer bail out, and now are positioned to continue to improve long term. The variant will impact this process, but if you are a buy and hold type person this is at a good price in my humble opinion."
"Good news on earnings. People are numb to COVID news, and will travel regardless.Back to $25 soon."
Get lost discord
I picked up more shares at 19.49
lots of volume for AAL. Is that supposed to mean money is moving in?
"Following the European markets last night in the down trend the US stocks are also going down. Yesterday the Airlines were so oversold that Hedge Funds are not sure they can risk short selling today, as a result the airlines are into positive territory to compensate for yesterday's overselling. At this point movement is undefined. The Asian markets are up making it difficult for the US to chose a trend. Anything that drops AAL close to 18 should be a buying opportunity."
"Cybersecurity breakthrough within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Only 750,000 shares total outstanding. Price ready to pop really big! Comps suggest $4.00 to $50. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5630521-microsoft-investment-in-4b-rubrik-cybersecurity-highlights-undiscovered-4m-data443-extremely"
Just joined the coach with 1500 shares…let’s see how this baby rolls..
"Well.. everyone longs and shorts, I hope your day today was a money making day. There is a lot of money to be made with AAL. The month of August had below expectation sales. It does not mean it was a bad month. That is why the stock is up. In addition, the covid is not deciding factor. It has some effect, but as long as people keep flying, money is coming in. Yesterday TSA numbers were up to 1.8million. Most likely the weekend rebounds above 2 million. The only real story here is airlines are flying people. Vaccinations are at 1 million a day. Trying to continue to go against the facts will hurt you if you don't time your shorts. Thank you, and have a great weekend."
Delta airline is now implementing a $200 per month for each employee that do not take vaccine and soon every airline will do the same.
"We could mark $25.5-26 as the first target.If ALL climbs slowly to $22 for 3 days, be careful it just needs 2 days to fly to $25.5-26."
Again record travel more than 2019 without international .And HF MF bring the hold sector down
Last chance to sell before $17...
This will drop 5-8% today. $16 might come next week or early September.
Gonna be holding this for years before these airlines ever go up..... being sarcastic
"Major catalyst for airlines next week, the transatlantic route is one of the most profitable for airlines.White House says they're reviewing lifting the European travel ban, an update will be given in a few days.$AAL $UAL $LUV $BA $JETS $JBLU $SAVE"
Aal will be positive around 10:30am/ET.
"Closing Green today, and Up over another $1 tomorrow !! (Mark this post)"
"This is a bargain and a guaranteed win at this price !Anything under $20 will double just hold onto it!AA will be making money just as it did before ,people have to fly and travel , also JBLU is also a bargain but you,ll make more with American ! buy ...buy....buy....and hold!"
CDC saying covid delta as contagious as chiken poxI’ve never even had chiken pox 
"The possibility of getting sick and dying is always a fact of life. 98+ percent of those who contract COVID live through it. I am one of those 98+ percent. I nipped it in the bud using only herbal tinctures and teas. The media loves fear mongering - it sells ads,"
"This stock is so fake, you watch the chart and see 4 green lines in a row and then it shows red someone selling who would sell for 4 cents up and 4 green lines in a row stock moving and someone sells with out see if it may go up 20 cents, yesterday at 24 million volume it was at even no gain no loss, really"
"The Covid fears continue relentlessly, yet AAL is recovering very nicely, oil dropping, interest rates down on business loans, and passengers tickets in high demand. The unvaccinated need to protect themselves and get a vaccine."
"The reasons for my postings is to help you see the wider picture. If you would like to have a solid understanding of day trading please go on YouTube and watch Warrior Trading By Ross Cameron. He has some insights that can help you develop your day trading skills. My strategies to make money have some similarities to his strategies, but I learned through 25 years of daily trading the Airlines everything I need to survive. I go with the market, with the path of least resistance. I short the stock when I have to, and go long when I have to. I am not trying to convince you that I am right. I am only sharing what I am thinking and what I am doing to make money to pay my bills."
"Based on TSA data, passenger throughput has maintained a trend of constant improving in the past 8 months, which may reach/overlap with pre-pandemic levels after a couple of weeks in September or in October."
bought several thousand shares at 20.32. Good money to be made from that entry point.
"way way oversold, hedge funds trying to bring this down to meet options at 19"
We have so many positive headlines and the stock shows red color. Hope it turns green and explodes after the market opens.
"S&P Up, Dow Up BIG, Airlines are ALL UP, and Uncle was in Red without all-time high Today.This is very crazy market, Very.That said, SouthWest sees weakening outlook with tickets cancelled the last moment, close-in price was also weak due to Virus, the PAX numbers were just little bit weaker so far this month at 78.59% for the last 10 days, compared to 79.65% of 2019 in July."
The funds are obviously suppressing AAL today. Come on Redditers and teach them a lesson.
I manage to scoop a few shares at 19.58. I have been loading up. This is a buying opportunity that will make money.
Coming One year will be awesome forget short term
"If the drop in share price includes AAL only then we can say this company is experiencing hard times but airlines along with cruises are going up and down together, some of other airline companies have lost more value in share price than AAL, the game is bigger than our predictions."
"The Best thing Uncle has down last year was to Convert lots of Airline Stocks last year at very low prices.Uncle has converted all the IRA to Roth the last few years, screw the RMD!"
Volume is almost normal today. We should be able to reverse the concerted sell attack.
"Excellent buy point, will see you all 30...very soon"
"Life is Good, Uncle's holding most of the pharma stocks got rewarded dearly, especially Today. Uncle's Holding most of the Airlines, though taking the backseats due to the fact that all of them will continue to lose money this quarter, will shine into 2022 nd beyond too. Stock market is a waiting game, Tide always goes in and out, it's NOT the Strongest who will last but only those who have the patient to last to the last moment are the Strongest. Airlines are Boring, they're still allow to Pop here and there, Today's just another Boring day.Uncle's High-techs are good too, but not Great, it's also boring since you know they'll continue to rally without extra excitement."
"The market needs time to wake up.The fear of stimulus just concerns the technology stocks.AAL and all flights stocks are recovery stock and undervalued.They gain the benefit in the interest rate increasing.I think the violation is affected by the oil price only.But this is short term, the oil should be $100 on ahead."
AAL has good resistance power at $19.5We hope it could rise from this point
"I should put a disclaimer here. I was sick with Covid last year in August and it almost killed me. I still suffer with complications from that event. I became fully vaccinated in January, and I am planning to get the Covid antibody booster shot."
just add another 2217 shares at 19.84
How can AAL is the only airline stock that still red today?
"Just buy the stock and hold on to it, this is a stock that been beaten up to no end, enough is enough, I don't see problem to travel if you are vaccinated."
The Tokyo Olympic will open successfully Tomorrow.The atmosphere is recovery.So the airline will rebound again.Buy NOW.AAL has good ER. High rally is in the beginning.
Gentlemen’s load and hold tomorrow will be tremendous day Enshallah
BK announce soon.
Anyone who has been the the airport in last 2 weeks or has a flight in the next month knows -- flights are empty and airlines are cancelling flights left right and center.
American Airlines has the potential to move down to 19.49. I am buying shares and riding a nice rebound.
"Shorts took a stab at it(like they do daily) this time around 9:17a...slowed down the run for 8 min(9:25a)Now on the rise again. Watch for big dumps of out-of-place volume, then a dip... for the past 2 months that meant it goes down or stays down at that level. Now it's recovering and going up after. Hopefully burning enough shorts/HF pukes to stop the daily raids (but I have my doubts...the leeches are thick across all stocks and have been for some time). The SEC needs to revise shorting regulations. In what other industry can you sell assets you have never and will never own?"
Curious if we get to $25 by the end of Summer.... I think $22 is realistic number. But who knows!
Does AAL is heading to bk again?I flew AAL from Houston to PA and it was full even standby ticket holder can not get in and the share price continue it downward slop.
idk unless govnt intervenes..people seem to be basically ok with travelling regardless
It looks like a great day to make money!!!
"AAL, just showed it's hand. It jumped up over 50 cents in a couple min. HF are playing games........."
Looks weak AF at the moment. I'm long on this but prepared to play the waiting game.
Airlines are fully book these days so it is the season where you want to buy their stocks as they will definitely beat analyst target estimates. Accuulate ow and be rewarded.
Wait until monday they will still be selling out as the stock goes up a penny
LOL Red soon???
American Airlines stock is working on a consolidation with a 26.19 buy point. FDA upcoming news will be the game changer.
"To Everyone, that bought AAL, and Didn't Panic sale ............."
"There is no business travel, no international travel. Until we do, you have to discount about 23% off pre-pandemic levels. 23% is the portion of travel and profits that is missing from the picture right now. So the price of this stage is about 23.15/share. We are undervalue by 3.40. At 18.15 it was way undervalue in a crazy way by 5 dollars/share. In addition, 77% travel is in place, enough to keep AAL and the other airlines afloat from bankruptcy. The worst for the airline industry is in the past as far as Covid is concern. Focus on the future of the airlines."
AAL will tank this week when the results from ALL the cancellations are processed. People are DUMPING trips made 3-6 months ago because of new COVID restrictions which are getting more aggressive by the week. Thoughts?
"Looks like the funds showed up to spoil the party. Because of the short interest, AAL is lagging all other major travel stocks today."
"What great opportunities to buy this stock at bargain prices. We all have to thank the unvaccinated. Specially when they end up in the hospital, and make the numbers look real bad, that is when you know they are doing their job very well."
"where are all the short sellers, beautiful day for them :)"
"The 7-Day moving Average of the PAX number has been declining for 15 days in a row since beginning of August, It's about 6.72%."
American Air passengers are stranded all across the USA. AAL illegally threatened to fire employees who are not vaccinated. Flight crews are not showing up for work. Forcing experimental vaccines on unwilling people is a violation of international law.
Headed to 15 or lower
"As I worked for 1 of the big 3, Airline stocks are never great, but this is a no brainer, AA trading low, post COVID bookings are already skyhigh. Normally I would say stay AAway, but this will be an ex money maker"
Impact from Ida on airlines Monday?
"EU bans US travel, have to live with this downturn for another few weeks, long term, no impact"
$AAL $UAL $DAL every chart is exactly the same. So NONE of this is about the companies. Only about overarching narratives and sentiment. So we are trading emotional fake scare swings.
"What distinguishes American is that it has the largest market share with regard to domestic aviation, which makes it recover faster than its counterparts because the recovery from the virus within the United States is large, while other companies will not return to profitability except with a global recovery because they depend on flights outside the United States mainly"
"So all the huge number traveler pass through TSA means nothing, what is with all the airlines stock? This stock market is extremely rigged"
Airlines have been getting lower highs and lower lows since June 2nd! Now winter is coming!
To whom bought load and hold as this quarter will be above expectations mark my words
"Double Upgrades for AAL from Bears, Stock Down.""Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik upgraded American Airlines (AAL) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $19, up from $16. The valuations of the U.S. airlines look less stretched following the recent share weakness, Yanoshik told investors in a research note. The analyst names Southwest Airlines (LUV) the most compelling sector pick and upgraded American to Hold given a higher earnings outlook and recent de-rating of the stock. Rising virus cases have yet to impact bookings and concerns over rising unit cost guidance seem overdone, Yanoshik added.Susquehanna analyst Christopher Stathoulopoulos also upgraded American Airlines to Neutral from Negative with a price target of $20, up from $18. The analyst said his base case does not assume a meaningful disruption due to variants and against this backdrop he prefers the low and ultra-low cost carriers."""
"stock is way oversold, by about 38 cents against the other Arlines, great buying opportunity on the near rebound before closing."
"People who’ve already had COVID-19 won't necessarily benefit from vaccination. That's why there's such a low vaccination rate. They have similar protection to those who are fully vaccinated, so why take the risk. Big pharma just looking for more money."
"TSA numbers for the weekend above 2million, and above 1.6. for Tuesday. Not bad at all. It signals a healthy recovery."
As head count continue to grow and earning has shown and big upside.AAL has bring in all their parked planes back to service.

"Earnings beat, recovery looks good. And stock price drops from the ""sell the news"" crowd, keep doing that and Ill add more. Price is already too low!"

You don’t have to trade stocks long to figure out the SEC is in bed with the HF
Nice manipulation by the institutions to live up n down options to bury all the shares outstanding. Thumbs up. Herzog move fromThé 90s
Supposed to be Trading at $29!!!!
"Marker played ""eBola 2.0"" Scare, it has Nothing to do with Uncle, Uncle has announced way ahead of time to hedge tech stocks, Uncle played chicken and assumed responsibility to protect Uncle's own money.Uncle did NOT hedge Airlines, it's too sentimental stuff to Uncle, Uncle paid price dearly."
"It should be very obvious that there may be a little slow down in air travel, but there will be no lockdowns. Thus, I love it when it drops because it becomes a buying opportunity with lots of money to be made.LOL!!!"

"If for some reason, AAL drops under 19.86 today I will be buying shares to enhance my long position."
"They keep talking about The Delta version. But the question they Don't ask is, How many people have Died from it?, because the answer is NONE !!!"
"19 days of Straight decline of 7-day moving average is not good; investors should pay attention of the COVID-19 cases and wait for the turnaround. There're lots of hot potatoes on the Street for buy-low and sell-high guys, there's no need to babysit the Airlines to get frustrated everyday.By the way, the 7-day moving average peaked on 8/1 at 2,068,411 and it's 1,875,375 Today.Hopefully, there will be more people get vaccinated and masked..."
When to the moon?
"Super Cup & Handles breakout on Uncle's super-long PFE has happened lately, the rally will accelerate...One Day, people will talk about the Airlines and do nothing but smiling...."
"Oil is cheaper, travel volume still high - a recipe for airline performance gains. In it to win it long. COVID news fatigue is real and vaccinations are on the rise again. Don’t be surprised if cases drop precipitously. Once AAL is back over 30, I’ll sell some to reinvest in other underperforming sectors. This is fun and lucrative!"
US govt is using American Airlines for two weeks to transport Afghan people and Americans out of Kabul

Allegiant and Frontier sold alcohol through the whole pandemic....no fights or issues.....American just doesn't get it.....let the people drink to take the edge off and relax

A new momentum is taking place. Soon above 20.00
"I am making some serious money. With all of the shares I bought at the low prices of yesterday and today, I am bringing in some serious cash to my trading account. So I took some risk off the table at 20.01"
"FDA's fully approval of Pfizer Vaccine will be a game changer; more people will take up the vaccine, including those #$%$ mandated to take one at work. It will happen and it is happening, and with so many people who have already infected (and got protection) and higher inoculation rate, hopefully we'll go back to normal in October."
Airline stocks are down as the European Union recommended Monday that its 27 member states reinstate Covid-related travel restrictions on the U.S.
