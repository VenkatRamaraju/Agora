Do y’all not know you are about to get flooded with about 400 million shares coming off of their lockup period Monday? I’m surprised no one has mentioned it on this form. I shorted this stock considering there are only 80 million shares currently with an average volume of 1-2 million. Hard times are ahead of y’all now that the ipo hype is over.  I wish I had warned y’all
Hey did they forget the dividend they promised
seems like only scott understands finance and how this company uses their cash...as soon as covid cools dodn and 1 phase 3 trial is approved you will never see this level again...stay strong scott they dont understand the business model and how much cashflow they recieve. the ceo is a genius at what he does.
"I have tried to find a reason to like this stock enough to purchase shares. I’ve followed this company since before it’s IPO. I even sat on a little cash waiting to pull the trigger. I’ve finally came to the conclusion this stock is going nowhere fast. In theory, it’s a good company. In reality, it’s a horrible investment. Good luck longs."
Well well - what a surprise. Look what's on Harvard's list of top 10 stocks checking in at #2 behind Apple! It's Royalty Pharmaceutical. Here's the article:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harvard-university-stock-portfolio-top-131810330.html
"This baby is stuck in a very tight range. Got support at the $36.00 level, got no support above $36.25. Is she gonna stay like this all the way until 3:30 ET?? I don't think so. Either way she is below yesterday's close and range. Clearly weaker. The odds favor a slow breakdown to the $35.60 level, far more than a breakout to the $36.60 level. It's worth it for me to stay Short, got many thousands of shares so every penny of profit counts. Meanwhile EBAY is acting solidly Green and even trending up, so there is no reason for me to rush into that Pure Earnings Short Sell until later on today."
Block trade of 4.4 mil shrs at 38.1 with a 50pt buy rating
A ton of recent insider selling. BEWARE.
RPRX is a long term gem. I am increasing my position due to its low price.
$1.37 up after hour. Look like good news for report.
Buy and Hold! This is Berkshire Hathaway type but for Health care!
"Why does RPRX use corporate funds, to make a charitable contribution? If Pablo wants to make a contribution personally, that is fine. However, he is using corporate funds, which should go to shareholders, to magnify his personal cause. The explanation of benefit to RPRX appears to be weak. Can anyone explain? Maybe, I am missing something."
$RPRX got bought out by Allergan for far less than the substantial tax break it will receive from the culminated carryover loss value of a company that spent hundreds of millions of dollars over 30 years and returned nothing.
The whole market is up yet this stock is always losing? Whats the reaon?
This stock is up for the #$%$ of the year award!
Why exactly has it moved up after taking on $2B in debt?
"I have narrowed my next Pure Earnings Short Sell play down to either RPRX or WIX. Right now I am definitely leaning in favor of RPRX, even though WIX is significantly more over-valued. One of the many wrinkles in the Pure Earnings Short Sell game is that you almost never can know when a company will deliver a big earnings surprise to the upside. But, because of the RPRX business model, we CAN reasonably assume that this past quarter was not super-duper chock full of unexpected profits. We have no recent FDA big drug approvals upon which RPRX can claim new and very large royalties. The company can tease the ""likelihood"" of such approvals coming up in the future, but of course there is absolutely no guarantee if, when, or how many, such approvals there might be.Do I wish RPRX was in the Green today, and was even more over-valued?? Of course. But it still looks like an extremely attractive Short Sell to hold through earnings release, especially if WIX stays in the Red for the next few hours, too. I will make a final decision between 3-4 PM ET, on which play to make. Good Luck Folks!"

You longs should call Cramer and thank him. What a great call.
RPRX finally starting to show a little life?
45 dollars for this stock coming very soon
"I love this. Small rise over a week after August 11, 2021 Q2 2021 Earnings Release $1.08 Est. $0.64 to $0.72Sitting now at 15x earnings- nice comfy multiple in a crazy market. This is a great one for having time to build a nice position, letting it ride and in 5-10 years should be throwing off cash like crazy."
"I am researching RPRX as a very attractive Pure Earnings Short Sell play for Tuesday of this week. Despite the large drop in share price in recent months, RPRX still looks very pricey and over-valued. I am analyzing both current/recent financials, and the validity of the business model they seem to be deploying, and to me this seems like a very poor business model that is essentially playing the lottery with very bad odds, in terms of them desperately hoping a bunch of their ""royalty"" drugs gain full FDA approval and become billion dollar sellers on the retail market. What I see is them throwing money at lots of ""potentially"" billion dollar drugs, but absent a high rate of actual breakthrough successes, the money they are throwing at the drugs is likely to surpass the money they will be able to generate via their ""royalty"" system. You see a consistent decline in EPS and a lot of very recent insider selling despite the depressed share price. High debt load, high P/E Ratio, and poor growth rate. A very new company on the public trading platform, that has not earned any respect from investors. If they deliver a poor ER Wednesday morning, I can easily see this one dropping 6-12% from the $37.00 level. Looks Bearish to me and an excellent risk/reward Pure Earnings Short Sell trade."
"I’ve been following this stock since it’s IPO, and keep waiting for it to move. It’s prospectus was very impressive, yet the company is not performing like I expected. I have yet to find a reason to purchase shares, although think this company has great potential. Any thoughts from longs appreciated."
Love this company. Long term winner. Buy and hold
"Really. You had so little hope in this company. It was at this point that it all started, maybe Cramer was right, this is a good piece of paper in the long run. With everything so inflated, it is better to go slowly but surely."
"Q3 is out, and it is an awesome one as we expected ( I thought it would be announced tomorrow though.)●GAAP financial results demonstrate continued strong operating cash flow generation and revenue growth●Cash provided by operating activities increased to $509 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with $436 million on a pro forma basis in the same period of 2019 primarily due to higher royalty receipts.●Cash used in investing activities of $1,042 million largely reflected two royalty acquisitions.●Cash used in financing activities of $357 million resulted from repayment of debt and dividends paid.●Total income and other revenues of $538 million grew 16% driven by the CF franchise and Imbruvica"
"Three really big volume days, and nice price action. I bought about a week ago with a very small position, but may buy a more substantial position now that this stock is proving itself."
"This RPRX is the FNV variant of the Pharmaceutical business and if asked to the equivalent of WPM, I think LGND will become the first to name."
"I’ve been waiting for an entry point to buy shares, but this still seems over priced. Once the 180 day post ipo lock-up expires, RPRX will be in the high 20’s.....and then I buy."
Finally reached my cost basis again. Bye bye 
what is it with this stock?Seems to have trouble staying up on any given day.
RPRK is stock for not new baby. This is like a protective and steady. It’s not jump up but not down or crash and keep stay up with dividend.This is the one I want to keep for under the this kind of volatile market condition.
RPRX is down 4.91% to 45.05
Well — Another winner for RPRX — crushes it in IMMU!

"Finally! Message board is open for $RPRX, $ZI, and $VRM."
Cramer keeps pumping this stock and it keeps going down.
When does the lock up expire?
"Just looked briefly at this company. Wow, does the CEO really make $55 million a year?"
