"I fear that until a bigger dividend is reinstated, we will continue to flounder."
patience ...bgcp will recover ...expect it to be $6 or $7 dollare stock in 2021 with a higher dividend ..
"Should be interesting how trading is impacted by upcoming option expirations of:+ 71,000 (7.1 million shares) of $3 calls expiring this Friday+ 22,000 (2.2 million shares) of $3.50 calls expiring Dec 18th.Generally Market Makers are on the side of selling options although there are retail investors who also sell options.The real question is whether those who sold these ‘in the money’ options will need to buy shares to fill their obligation or will want to repurchase shares they have to provide to the option buyers.So, next week could see some upward momentum in buying as the 7.1 million shares change hands. The option holders who do not want shares will generally close out their option position rather than get shares and then sell those.Fairly pleased with share price action of late although I had hoped to accumulate more shares under $3. I did get a reasonable position...but was waiting to buy more if shares saw any weakness. I liked the comments during the Conference Call about shares being undervalued and how they are considering a capital return policy which will be discussed during the first quarter of 2021."
this stock will do very well from here..i added in the 4s..now i anticipate a steady slow climb to 10..and the dividend sweetens the pot as i have owned since 2009...
"I believe the negative action is do to the year-ago comparisons. Many ""automated"" services, of which there are many, do not see a spin-off as the same as a stock split. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence services like Zacks and Thompson Reuters/Versus downgraded to Sell and Hold respectively on earnings. In fact Zacks upgraded on the 9th, and downgraded on the 11th. Consider Earnings of 18c versus 32c and dividends of 14c versus 18c. You and I know that they did not take out the contributions of NMRK to those year-ago numbers, but the computers not only don't know, they don't care. I called. That's a 44% decline in earnings and a 22% decline in the dividend, year-over-year reported. Looks awful except untrue if you take out NMRK's contribution to last years numbers.In addition, and I don't know what funds or dates they use, but if BGCP pre-spin was a ""mid-cap"", what is it now? Probably a small-cap, so needed to be sold out of those funds that have Market Cap restrictions; i.e. dump the losers and add the winners. If you don't care about the details, the stock is off 50% and has half the market cap and gross revenues, therefore it is OUT. This is what I believe caused the selling post quarterly earnings. Q/Q and Y/Y numbers will be screwed up some time."
"Massive green day yesterday, BGCP flat.Market flat today, BGCP down big. NMRK too.Me thinks the people on this board do not understand the spinoff flop, or don't want to admit it to themselves."
Wish list for the call this morning.Conversion to Simpler C-Corp.Increase in dividend to at least 50% of Net earnings.Report of continued double digit quarterly growth of Fenics revenue.Increase in annual profit contribution from Insurance business.
What is wrong with this stock?! Why can’t it break out above $3? Can someone explain? I’m wondering whether it is worth holding or if I should sell and move on. Any long term holders here? Anyone going to keep holding?
I was very pleased with the earnings report. I believe they are good enough to power the stock well above 3. Had the market been up I believe the stock be up 30 cents. With that said I think maintaining the 1 cent dividend was viewed as a yellow flag. I would have liked to see it go to 3 cents per share in this report. Many of the core shareholders are folks who want and expect dividends. With that said I'm starting to think that BCG with probably compliment Interactive Brokers platform and it would not surprise me to BGCP get taken out.
"So am I reading this right? If the Nasdaq and Tradeweb deal goes through then BGCP receives 6,200,000 shrs of NADQ in 2021. At current price that's a billion bucks worth. So if we assume the deal is certain that means market values BGCP alone at around $2.65 a shr. Now I realize it's not certain but very likely. Has the company commented on what they plan to do with the NADQ shrs? Am I reading this wrong?"
"I posted this last night....but do not see it here so another case of Yahoo ‘losing’ posts.The short interest in BGCP has been updated and another 1.6 million shares were shorted in the 2nd half of January 2021 as the short interest went from 14.9 million shares short to 16.5 million. This site shows the average volume in BGCP as 1.7 million shares/day so the days to cover is 9 days.For comparison, the share price at the beginning of this period (Jan 15th) was $3.80 and ended January at $3.55. Yesterday (Wednesday 2/10), BGCO closed at $4.27 so all the shorts who did not cover are down nearly 20% from the close of January price.Now, the question is whether you want to be short going into the earnings call when we might hear about a capital return policy.And, we have news that BGCP’s Fenics won a Platform Trading Award for 2021....which follows yesterday’s news that BGCP’s CapitaLab won a 2021 Award for Service Infrastructure. These awards should get noticed by potential customers who may need these highly rated services. You can see both of these articles on Yahoo’s Summary Page for BGCP. You can see the twice monthly short volume for the past year at: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bgcp/short-interest"

"So, is this an overreaction and buying opportunity?The thing that gets me is the extreme measures as:+ Why cut dividend from $0.14/quarter to $0.01/quarter. => Why wasn’t it cut in half for a still reasonable yield?+ Why the draw on their credit line as it would seem cutting the dividend so drastically would improve cash flow and thus no need to take on additional interest payments?+ Why the cut in distributions to partners?And, why all three of these.....at the same time? Between these three fairly extreme measures, there is something we do not know. And, with the extreme selling today, it seems many are selling without asking questions.So, why the extreme measures.....and all being taken at once?But, does this mean a good buying opportunity for a bounce?"
"Best value stock in the market right now PERIOD!Can't wait for earnings release and news on share buyback, etc."
Blowout quarter for Goldman Sachs equity trading during a Reddit-fueled stock boom bodes well for BGCP's 1Q results.
BGCP will do a share buyback and over $5 next week going into earnings there are always big block trades near the end of the day
seems cheap for a company that is going to earn over 70 cents? why the low price? should be at least $7 ...?
BGCP is a buy
Liked what I heard but wished they would have been more definitive about the spin off. Also need to raise the dividend. Remember it was lowered previously. Also the credit ratings must be addressed promptly. But all in all a good presentation. Looking forward to others opinions.
Compared to MKTX & TW we look like the best value.
Earnings look solid . Hopefully we get a bounce nothing but down since it hit 17. Starting to get depressed.
"These price takedowns are not the way a seller trying to get the best price sells. They could have sold a lot of these shares yesterday over $4...so why crash the price now with selling.If you are selling:+ Best to do so selling lower strike priced calls+ Sell slowly so as not to crash the priceWhat I have seen here in BGCP seems to be games...probably by those wanting to cause panic selling so they can accumulate shares at lower prices. After all, how did Blackrock buy 2 million shares here recently (10% increase in holdings) while price was lower?"
It’s just starting to gain its momentum.
over 2 billion in revenues in 2019 and met expectations. This company should have heavy trading at this price!

Does anyone know the latest news on the Newmark share dispersement. Can't find anything for a while and the cutoff date was months and months ago. Thanks
Earnings tomorrow am. The spinoff has been a success ! Congrats to all that did not panic during the selloff. It was Tuff watching BGCP drop from $15+ to the low 5s. We are also in the green with NMRK. They report next week IIRC. Stay long !!!
you can isten to Howard ansewr question from today annual meeting at the company's website he says stock should be near $10and will be growing the company to prove it to the Street people
"I spoke to someone at BGC in investor relations yesterday regarding the IPO and benefits to BGC stockholders. I was told there would not be any distribution of NMRK shares to BGC holders before 180 days. In addition, they are waiting for the IRS ruling to come back regarding a tax free distribution before they can determine when and how the shares will be distributed to the BGC stock holders. They also have not picked the X dividend date as of yet. There will be press releases giving us more information once the decisions have been made. We just have to be patient!"
since 2011 fella its up 430% not including dividends..so settle down
Short interest at October November 2020 levels. Stock to take off relatively shortly IMHO

does this company have enough cash flow to pay that dividend?....
45% of what u own in bgcp shares in the form of nmrk shares for free..which is trading at 13.39 and will trade north of 20
Anyone going to buy this stock into earnings? Think they will surprise with a good report?
Howard said BGCP bought 30 million shares of stock but did not give the average price per share anyone know?
Hi do we know more about the timing of the spin off?
i am not a big proponent of stock buybacks -only if the shares are retired. what can happen is the shares bought back are given out to execs and employees for rewards. so how does that help me as a shareholder? i like to see dividend increases. a better turnaround play is wells fargo - and it will pay a better dividend once restrictions on the company from past misdeeds are lifted. Citigroup also undervalued ...glta
Post spin off Bgc shares would worth today 4.6$ and would yield 11% in this current market. If you think yield should be 6.3% like it is now...share post spin off should be around 8$. So current market value should be 14$ something if everything stay the same...am I right?
remember Gary and all the cantor employees who passed today 17 years ago --Howard has done a good job bringing the company back
Bring on my shares of NMRK. First day of trading. $14 is the price. Love BGCP and Howard. What a solid for the share holders.
"I am liking the price action here with these comments:+ Great recovery in share price after yesterday’s down day....and the down day last week.=> Generally seeing higher prices in morning, decline during the day and then some recovery in prices towards the close.+ Fundamentals look good as BGCP has earned $0.44x/share in the first 9 months of this year with $0.11x expected in 4Q 2020 for a total of $0.56/share in 2020 and then a 23% increase in EPS to $0.69/share in 2021 as their insurance division goes positive and additional growth in Fenics (see today’s news)=> This means we have a current P/E of $4.40/$0.56 = 7.85 P/E for 2020=> Forward P/E for 2021 would be $4.40/$0.69 = 6.4 P/E for 2021=> Note that financial institutions generally carry a lower P/E of around 10 meaning BGCP could support a price of ~$7/share+ From a PEG (P/E to Growth), most stocks have a P/E of over 1 meaning they have a P/E higher than the growth rate....so BGCP could support a higher P/E due to the growth rate of 23% for 2021. => From Barron’s which gives a $$0.80 EPS for 2022 (16% above 2021), BGCP’s 2 year average EPS growth rate would be around 19.5%/yr so BGCP could support a higher than 10 P/E. https://www.barrons.com/quote/stock/us/xnas/bgcp/research-ratings=> Paying a higher dividend (say 25% of EPS) could also allow a higher than financial institution P/E of 10. + From a technical basis, BGCP needs to consolidate at some point as it is trading nearly $1 or 23% above its rising 50 Day Moving Average (DMA) and higher than $1.50 above the lower 200 DMA.=> 14 day Relative Strength Index is somewhat elevated at 74 showing that it has outperformed 74% of the stocks over the past 2 weeks.=> Can justify this due to extreme drop, lower base, lower than average P/E, higher than P/E growth (i.e. PEG well below 1.0)=> Chart pattern looks like ‘a bathtub’ with a drop from the $6’s when BGCP cuts their dividend and covid onset for a long base around $2.x and now the sharper recovery in price.+ Positive outlook of capital return to shareholders as mentioned by CEO at last conference call. We may see the focus on share buybacks first as the shares are viewed as undervalued (and criticism of BGCP of using shares as compensation/incentives which increases share count)...but we could get a smaller increase in the dividend....and then later, a larger increase in dividend when shares get fairly valued and buybacks are reduced.=> There is also debt to paid back with debt at $1.5 Billion offset by nearly $800 million in cash + cash equivalents as shown on Yahoo’s statistics tab=> Note that there are ~320M shares so net earnings will be around $35 million ($0.11/share) in 4Q 2020, $210M in 2021 and $250M in 2022.=> So, there is a lot of cash coming in for buybacks, dividends and debt replacement....although EPS is not all cash (includes depreciation, amortization, etc....although those are smaller for financial companies who don’t manufacture things).All in all, I think BGCP is still a buy here for those wanting to add as I think it gets to at least $8 (10 times 2022 EPS estimates) which would be a 90% gain in share price by perhaps mid-2022 or in 18 months....while providing some income via the dividend.Comments, discussion, corrections?"
BGCP is going to be growing fast in 2019 already looking at new partners Howard is building a great company !
"In the 3Q 2020 Quarterly Earnings Presentation, it is stated that BGCP will announce its updated investor capital return policy during 1Q 2021. The 4Q 2020 earnings announcement is scheduled for February 24th, so I expect the update to occur then."
Primed for next leg up
"So what is everyone's best information on what holders of BGCP will get from the Newmark spin off?? I can only guess it's probably like a 1 for 10 share ""dividend"" but the when is questionable and the exactly what is just a guess at this point. I read earliest would be another 150 days from now..."
right now when u factor in nmrk.. bgcp is trading at about 8.82 pre spinoff and the dividend factoring in nmrk is .744c a yr which is higher than bgcp highest of 72c a yr.. so if u hold both for 10yrs u r picking up 7.44 pts even if the 2 names just tread water.. its a steady return
"BGCP delivered earnings and revenue surprises of 7.14% and 2.35%, respectively, for the quarter ended June 2018, but that didn't move the needle upward. I'm in it for the divvie, but would like a little appreciation too. Wondering if I should hold it til the end of the year."
Nmrk decision to leave div unchanged is understandable as this is the time for that company to invest in its expansion. BGCP on the other hand has invested heavily and now it's time to give back to shareholders. Buybacks and div increase on its way IMHO.
"Soros funds bought BGCP between April and June , added to their holdings a total of 3567145 shares, g that was an increase of 141.4% also got the dividend 499400.3 Also PFG the second largestest holder after Vangaurd both added to their holdingsi think BGCP will produce geat earnings this quarter and next BREXIT"
Great conference today. Howard was excellent as usual. Stock up afterhours
$6 .... should be $6 .. and i do think we will get prior to or shortly after next earnings release and guidance
"Howard is clearly tired of seeing this stock trampled on.Pretty sure he's got a few tricks up his sleeve.A double from here should be no problem, since even at that point it would still be undervalued by at least 50%!10 by eoy, my friends! Last chance to board the BGCP rocket."
"Hi; been in BGCP since 5. I am still confused about the NMRK spinoff. Are newly purchased shares still eligible for the spinoff or has the time period past? I emailed BGCP investor relations but of course, no one responded. Also, any thoughts when the spinoff will occur?Thanks"
"Correct math is 2.2 shares of BG = 1 share NMRK. Therefore NMRK / 2.2 = Portion of BG price associated to NMRK. 16.40 / 2.2 = 7.45. Take BGCP (14.45) minus NMRK portion (7.45) leaves BG alone worth 7.00. If, as Howard said, BG is 55% of current Rev/Profits and 2018 projected per share profits of $1.31, then BG alone profits are $0.72. BG pays dividend based on 75% of ""projected"" profits, as per Howard comments in Company conference call. Therefore, dividend (post NMRK spin-off) is $0.54 divided by the 7.00 current valuation for the BG portion alone is a 7.72% yield. Confusion over the ""when"" of the spin-off and residual valuation, as well as dividend yield of the NMRK portion adds uncertainty. Uncertainty = opportunity. Let's say BG dividend is just $0.48 or $0.12 per Quarter, and the post NMRK stock were to yield 5.5% (typical to high small brokerage yield) then $0.48 / 0.055 = 8.73 for BG alone. Add back in the current NMRK (16.45 / 2.2 or 7.45) and current fair value is 16.17. That's low-balling Dividend target and asking for a higher yield of 5.5%. Optimistic outlook would be $0.54 dividend at a 4.5% yield would equal BG worth 12.00 plus NMRK at 7.45 equals 19.45. Call that an April 2019 price target (because that is when BG will increase likely its dividend a second time post NMRK.) Hopefully we get clarity Feb 7th conference call."
Is Bgcp going to drop overnight the 23rd or the 30th?
"Okay, now I get the funky trading here in BGCP this week (like down huge in pre-market today while overall markets were up big). Look at all the $3 call options for November 20th as it is over 75,000 contracts. As each contract is for 100 shares, that is over 7.5 million shares to change hands if BGCP closes over $3 on November 20th.Earlier this week, it looked to me like someone was selling...and dumping larger blocks of shares. I just thought they were inpatient to sell out for some reason...but now wonder if they are just trying to break the upward momentum in BGCP to keep this under $3...or within sight of $3 so they can take it down on the 3rd Friday in November.Even this morning, it looked like someone was trying to panic holders. Don’t get fooled and just figure BGCP may be range bound until after options expiration. Later, the battleground for options is higher...like the $3.50 calls on December 18th and the $5 calls on January 15th 2021."
Capitalab wins the OTC infrastructure service of the year award at Risk.net BGCP is reinventing brokering with their superior technology platforms. IMHO
Poor dividend no reason to buy more. Have bunch. Just watching it recover. Think it will continue to improve. Other stocks to buy at this time have opportunity for faster appreciation.
Howard gave up beat talk yesterday under value may increase dividend 100% may enter the realm of bit coin
It is odd that no news (that's normally associated with spin offs) ) has been published from the very first announcement regarding share holders portion.
revenues beat.. bgcp will continue creeping higher and will continue paying a fat dividend
Will we get some short covering as we get closer to the ex-dividend date of Feb 25th?
add on dips and take the dividend
Stocks plunge after CDC warning good for bonds and BGCP!
"Be impartial....but why is BGCP selling off on earnings? I can only think of the recent run-up and computer trading taking advantage of the sell-off. But, I am thinking to buy today on this weakness.Is there something I am missing here? Did Howard say something negative or bearish? I’m starting to do some research but thought I would ask here.One would think yesterday’s close of $5.80 would support a $0.17/share EPS and nearly 10% dividend yield. And, announcing another upcoming $0.14/share dividend would also support the $5.80 price. I am going to read the PR another time and look for the conference call transcript...but I think BGCP is a strong buy here below $5.40."
"Anyone doubting there are ‘games’ being played here with the stock trading....as BGCP share price has a lower Relative Strength with the share price lagging the financials and the small caps both of which are rallying to some degree (small caps more so than financials)?Obviously pre-announcing revenue and projected margins/earnings did not attract much buying interest from value investors...although BGCP flies below ‘the radar’ on most searches...partly due to price and market cap. Most investors just don’t know about BGCP and there is little analyst coverage and such. With BGCP trading below $5, it is generally not margin-able...and some funds do not invest in stocks with share prices below $5 for this and other reasons.I do find the trading interesting as many times the share price and volume rallies at the end of most days. So, it seems someone is pushing it down to promote selling/trading at lower prices...and then scoops up shares at the end of the day as it then rallies back to near even. So, this seems a positive to me as it is accumulated.I did a bit of research and found that BGCP is in the Russell 1000 (IWF) and Russell 3000 (IWV) ETF’s...but not in the more popular Russell 2000 (IWM). So, when someone buys the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000, they get some BGCP without knowing about the company...but is not in the much higher volume Russell 2000 ETF.So, if one has faith in BGCP, now is the time to accumulate on daily weakness and prior to the end of day rallies...and I have been doing this by selling Put options (Feb 19th $4 Puts are bidding around $0.40 giving me a net price of $3.60...but I’ll only get shares if it is trading below $4 on the option expiration day).As for a catalyst to move the share price meaningfully higher, I think a lot of that will be news related. And, while we know earnings will be released prior to market open on February 24th. This is historically late for 4Q & FY, so perhaps BGCP is working out some issues for disclosure (say capital return policy of buybacks & increased dividends). The later date (more than 50% through 1Q 2021) also means better 1Q guidance). Hopefully we also get more information on the China Joint Venture (cost, projected revenues, etc.) along with more detailed information on their insurance (should now be profitable) and growth in Fenics (both organic with continuing customers and growth via new customers as recently/periodically announced).By SEC regulation, all releases of substance must be shared widely via PR before being discussed at limited attendance gatherings like a quarterly conference call. So, anything of substance like the capital return policy should be announced via a PR...or in the quarterly PR put out prior to the conference call.Finally, I have faith in BGCP as their pre-announcement shows earnings which match the year before quarters...on slightly lower revenue. The only negative I can find is that revenues have been declining even as they tout growth in Fenics...so some part of their business has declining revenues. Profit margins and tax rates do fluctuate a bit...but BGCP has a lower P/E and is thus a good value stock with limited downside. Comments/discussions?"
"Earnings expectations continuing to rise as per https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BGCP/analysis?p=BGCPThe top set of numbers show current estimates (average high, low, change) for current quarter, next quarter, Financial Year, Next Financial Year while the second set of numbers show revenue expectation and comparisons.Go down to the 4th set of numbers labeled EPS Trend...and see how earnings estimates have changed over time (90 days, 60 days, 30 days, 7 days and current). The change is especially noticeable in FY2021 (right most column) where they are up 10% just recently (from $0.63 to $0.69).Now, go back to the top and see the right hand column where it shows $0.69 is the average, high and low estimates (basically both analysts have the same EPS target) and how that number is 25% higher than the 2020 estimate of $0.56.So, slap a 10 P/E on BGCP’s estimate and we get a $6.90 share price. Then, consider that a buyback will reduce the number of shares meaning the EPS goes up.....or that an increase in dividend could bring us a higher P/E....and quarterly dividends."
I would really like to see the dividend boosted to .05c a quarter with slow steady increases.
any guesses on eps tomorrow or what the forward div might be?
i wish i knew something about rubric capital.. they added 5.2mln shares.. point72 tho sold 60% of their holdings
"For anyone that sold today after the updated guidance which said that they were doing better than their previous guidance, why did you sell? I am trying to understand, why people sold so much on this news. It seems like it is good news and good that they are being conservative with their cash!"
+9% my friends!So it begins...
Is this a good buy @ $14?
I put my spare cash in epd for no tax return of capital i'm to old to wait on bgcp recovery but I believe they will recover in a few years
"Don't know why all my posts constantly Vanish. That is why i stick with Seeking Alpha. This site has evolved into a JOKE ! BGCP is a buy, DRIP and add on Dips. Good Luck to all....cya"
write to shareholder relations ... ask them why they are hurting their own stock price by keeping the dividend so low? they continue to make profits through the worst of the pandemic. now that management got their cheap shares- time to rise the dividend ..
"the dividend appears to be safe and pays over 10%. even if the stock goes nowhere, you double your investment in 10 years by collecting dividends. bond yields are dropping. go try to find a better deal. good luck .."
buy low sell high ....it is low ...stop complaining ... it is an opportunity ...its low due to divi cut ...it will be raised ...and that will send signal that better times are seen ahead ....i prefer to get in before then ...so i can make my money ...you can too ...gl
Very good article on Seeking Alpha - BGC partners: Who are These Guys?
Yahoo has removed my posts on today’s news that BGCP has affirmed their 4Q2020 guidance. I saved the post on my word processor and tried using it as a reply...and even removed the link to the PR.Is anyone else having trouble with Yahoo posts?
"fitch rating Fitch Ratings-New York-02 October 2019:Fitch Ratings has assigned a final 'BBB-' senior unsecured long-term debt rating to BGC Partners Inc.'s(BGCP)$300 million notes due Oct. 1, 2024. The notes bear an annual coupon of 3.75%, with interest paid semi-annually.The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned to the senior unsecured notes on Sept. 20, 2019; see "" Fitch Expects to Rate BGC's Unsecured Notes 'BBB-(EXP)'; Ratings Affirmed"" at www.fitchratings.com.Key Rating DriversThe unsecured debt rating is equalized with BGC's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and reflects the firm's largely unsecured corporate funding profile and Fitch's expectation for average recovery prospects on the debt in a stressed scenario. The newly issued notes rank equally with the existing senior unsecured debt, and therefore, their rating is equalized with BGC's outstanding senior unsecured debt and its Long-Term IDR.BGC's ratings reflect the company's established franchise in the inter-dealer broker (IDB) space, generally limited use of leverage, strong interest coverage, experienced management team and sound profitability metrics. Ratings continue to be constrained by the reduced, albeit improving, earnings diversification following the spin-off of Newmark Group Inc. (Newmark; BBB-/Stable), the cyclical nature of the IDB business and structural regulatory reforms that are affecting volumes and profitability. Fitch continues to believe that elevated key person risk associated with BGC's CEO is a constraint to the ratings.BGC's ratings are equalized with those of its parent, Cantor. Fitch applies a common rating approach to the two entities, reflecting BGC's meaningful ownership percentage by Cantor and 61% voting control, strong integration of the firms' management teams, operations and systems, and the potential balance sheet fungibilty. While there may be a scenario where BGC and Cantor's ratings differ, Fitch believes the companies' credit profiles cannot be meaningfully disentangled given their current operating strategies. However, Fitch cannot envision a scenario where BGC would be rated higher than Cantor.Pro forma for the issuance of $300 million of unsecured notes and the repayment of amounts outstanding on the credit facility (approximately $278 million), leverage would increase modestly, to 2.39x from 2.35x at June 30, 2019. Fitch would view an increase in leverage above 2.5x negatively, particularly given BGC's reduced earnings diversity following the Newmark spin. BGC has a demonstrated track record of managing its leverage within Fitch's 'bbb' category quantitative benchmark range of 1.5x to 2.5x for securities firms with low balance sheet usage.BGC's interest coverage, as measured by adjusted EBITDA to interest expense, was 9.0x for the TTM ended second-quarter 2019 (2Q19). Pro forma for the issuance, Fitch expects coverage to be at around 8.0x, which is within Fitch's 'bbb' category interest coverage benchmark range of 6.0x to 10.0x for securities firms with low balance sheet usage.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe senior unsecured debt rating is sensitive to changes in BGC's Long-Term IDR and would be expected to move in tandem.The ratings of BGC and its parent, Cantor, are expected to remain equalized. As a result, BGC's ratings are expected to move in tandem. Fitch cannot envision a scenario where BGC would be rated higher than its parent. However, growth and diversification of the brokerage platforms, such that earnings prove to be more durable over multiple operating cycles, sustained strong profit margins and maintenance of conservative leverage and interest coverage metrics could have a positive influence on the ratings.Conversely, a change in Fitch's assessment of BGC's strategic importance to Cantor could change the relative notching. An increase in leverage above 2.5x or a decrease in interest coverage below 6x, on a sustained basis, increased shareholder-friendly activities, including higher dividends or outsized share buybacks, and/or adverse shifts in the firm's risk appetite, including growth of balance sheet-intensive activities, would also be viewed negatively from a ratings perspective.Date of Relevant Committee19 September 2019 ESG Considerations"
Good update after the close today! BGCP upping their guidance!
when owning bgcp u also own 45% of what u own in bgcp shares for free.. which are trading at 13.39.. and if u have owned since 2009 like me you had 10yrs of qualifying dividends which get taxed lower of around 65c a year..so its been a good play getting better
"Another good week here in BGCP as the shares are up around 6.5% and went ex-dividend (payable Dec 1st) earning shareholders another penny/share while the S&P500 was down around 0.7%.For those technicians, the chart is getting close to the ‘bullish Golden cross’....where the 50 Day Moving Average (DMA) will soon cross over above the 200 DMA while rising upwards."
When is the big breakout?!?!? I keep buying on these dips and haven’t seen this stock take off over $3! Anyone have any thoughts on why this stock is stalled out below $3?
raymond james reiterates strong buy on bgcp pt 16 with obvious knowledge of what the spinoff means
Wondering...Is Howard selling BGCP?
Not seeing any news to understand the last couple of days. Anybody hear anything that would help explain the -5% sell off?
"time to review BGCP sold espeed to the NASDX in 2013 for millions in cash and stockBGC Announces Close of Sale of its Platform for the Fully Electronic Trading of Benchmark, on-the-Run U.S. Treasuries to NASDAQ OMXNEW YORK, NY – July 1, 2013 – BGC Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ: BGCP) (“BGC Partners,” “BGC,” or “Company”), today announced that it closed the sale of its benchmark on-the-run, 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year fully electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds to NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: NDAQ) (“NASDAQ OMX.”) The purchase consideration consists of $750 million in cash paid upon closing, plus an expected earn-out of up to $484 million of NASDAQ OMX common stock to be paid ratably over 15 years, assuming that NASDAQ OMX, as a whole, generates at least $25 million in revenues each year.On the June 28, 2013 closing, NASDAQ OMX purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from BGC and its affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the fully electronic portion of BGC’s benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses (the “Purchased Assets”). BGC retains all of its other voice, hybrid, and fully electronic trading, market data, and software businesses, including voice, hybrid and electronic brokerage of off-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as Treasury Bills, Treasury Swaps, Treasury Repos, Treasury Spreads, and Treasury Rolls. BGC also continues to offer voice brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries.For further details on the Purchased Assets and the closing of the sale, please see BGC’s filings on Forms 8-K and 10-Q discussing the transaction.so TW gets espeed for 190 million after less then 9 years ownership by nasdax"
"been buying shares of bgp as it has been rallying ..up 17% on average .. they lowered the dividend during the pandemic, but i do expect they will raise it. not to the levels it was prior based on mgmt statements and new corporate structure, but higher than where we are now. that and rising earnings estimates should help propel the stock price higher as investors buy up risk-on assets with the vaccines on the near horizon readied for distribution...glta"
"Help me out here.... That PR said Nasdaq sold that platform but had purchased it from BGC and was obligated to give BGC 6.2 million shares upon the closing. At a $140. a share, current value would be $868 million gain. That's enough to buy back 2/3 the float.... and the stock is trading up $.14 as I type. What did I miss."
Why is those fading over the past few days? Has it lost momentum? Bank and financial stocks have been on tear but BGCP is fading. What’s happening?
it doesnt hurt that blackrock filed a 13G because they own 22mln shares
"Not much to cheer about in today’s report...so Howard better say something upbeat in the conference call.Revenue is still dropping year over year....so what is causing the revenue declines when Fenics and insurance are doing growing so well? Earnings are mostly even year over year so margins on Fenics and Insurance are better than where revenue is dropping...but not by much as overall net income is not really growing much year over year.No details in capital return policy which seems to be a big punt...as they did not even give an amount of capital associated with the share buybacks. So, with no given target, how can we track this? Dividends would have interrupted the games played by shorts....so it seems the shorts have little to worry about here.Someone else posted here that there was already funds for a share buyback approved...so why didn’t they buyback shares when this was $3? And, if they didn’t buy back share then, why should we trust they will buy back shares now at a higher price....again when they gave no concrete details on amount or timing....or even price?So, all we have is valuation...and the shares are no longer greatly undervalued here as this now trades just under a 10 P/E which is not greatly undervalued by financial industry standards.What am I missing here? What is the catalyst going forward as this traded near a 10 P/E with a much higher dividend in the past? What will push the share price higher with near similar earnings and just a $0.01/share dividend each quarter?Admit it that this PR does not meet expectations for growth or dividend...as there is nothing exciting for shareholders...including a nothingburger on capital returns.I think the easy money has been made here. And, with no change in dividend policy until end of year, what is to hold up the share price and what will keep the shorts in check? I suspect the share price could be range bound here with no real growth in revenue or net income/EPS or dividend as a catalyst."
Wooo finally
"howard hire stock bashers to keep BGCP down so the company can buy the stock cheaper . make sense , why not?"
bgcp was a 5.5bln mkt cap.. nmrk plus bgcp today = 8.2bln mkt cap cutrently which the spinoff was intended to create.. the selling will continue but when it stops if the combined mkt cap is 6.5bln he has increased the value by 1bln and 1 pays 36c div a yr and the other pays 72c div a year .. the spinoff would be clearly very successful and beneficial to the original bgcp shareholders handsomely
Did Howard give any investors more confidence in the future?
"Not sure why this news is not posted on summary page...but may be the first step in the restructuring for simplicity as it combines the various insurance groups under one holding company.

"I’ve been going over the transcript and found this from: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4362568-bgc-partners-bgcp-ceo-howard-lutnick-on-q2-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single“ But it is clearly yet to be appreciated by the marketplace. To illustrate this, let me walk through our 2020 actual and expected results by quarter. We earned a $0.01 more than last year in the first quarter. We are in $0.02 less in the second quarter. At the midpoint of our third quarter guidance, our earnings would be $0.03 lower than last year.And we expect that the midpoint of the range of our fourth quarter earnings to be flat to maybe down a $0.01 as compared with last year. So if I compare the $0.61 we made in 2019 to the midpoint of $0.55 to $0.56 we expect to make this year. Our earnings would be down 10%. We expect our earnings to rebound and to be virtually flat in the fourth quarter further, we expect to generate EPS growth in 2021, driven by the improvements Shaun and I just outlined from Fenics and insurance.Our solid voice franchise and the efficiencies that Steve Bisgay outlined. There was clearly a disconnect between our stock price and our earnings. While our 2020 earnings are only expected to be down 10%. BGC share prices down 50% year-on-year and we are trading a half the multiple of our peers. This deeply disturbs us given our anticipated growth next year, and the embedded value we are building in the Fenics business as well as insurance. These are both businesses, Fenics and insurance that our peers just do not have.Lastly, let's turn to our capital return. With the outbreak of COVID-19, we reduced our dividend and focused on strengthening our balance sheet. Early next year, we expect to announce our capital return policy, focused on increasing our dividend and detailing our share repurchase plan. Previously, we were deeply dividend centric. Going forward, we be planned to deeply consider both potential outcomes, share buybacks as well as dividend.”"

"14 cent dividend, nice! Kick in 9 cent divi from nmrk and we have 24 cent vs 18 cent dividend, nice upgrade!"
"News today: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gfi-announces-joint-venture-china-070000278.htmlI wonder if/when we will get more details such as price paid, estimates of revenue/margins, if this will be accretive, etc., etc.I am somewhat positive on this as this expands BGCP’s data and markets...but one always wonders when doing business with/in China. But mostly, I would like to know what they paid, when/how this acquisition will become profitable, etc., etc. I sure hope BGCP puts out a PR with some details....and then talks more about it when they announce 4Q results.In essence, all I want to know would be the assumptions/projections BGCP used to determine that this was a wise acquisition as you know they did an internal study with assumptions, risks and projections. But overall, this seems like positive news."
Hmmmm . . . Maybe I’m on to something. Cantor Fitzgerald's SPAC CF Acquisition IV prices upsized $450 million IPO at $10
"For perspective, BGCP closed at $2.51 on October 27th; the day before they announced their 3Q 2020 earnings and provided guidance and held their conference call. So, we are up ~95% since then....or nearly a home run (at warning track?).So, will we get some ‘sell on the news’ with the upcoming earnings PR on the 24th and conference call? One could argue that we could...even as we mostly know the results due to the early January 2021 PR saying they were meeting 4Q guidance.So, it could come down to three main factors.1) Guidance for 1Q 2021 and whatever they say about the full year 20212) Capital return policy....and how quickly it gets instituted. I am fine with them growing into their policy...but would like to see a target % of earnings going to either (or both) share buybacks and dividend.3) Resulting valuation based upon forward P/E, PEG and dividend.But, I also have some funds ready in case I am happy with the results and there is a sell-off to some degree. I just don’t know what I will put into buying shares, what I will use to buy call options and what I might use to sell Puts.What do others think is needed and will happen?"
no need for a brexit question..brokers make money so long as there is volatility..brexit adds to volatility
"BGC Partners To Buy Ed Broking Group - Quick FactsBy RTTNews Staff Writer  | Published: 10/29/2018 6:37 AM ETBGC Partners, Inc. (BGCP) announced an agreement to acquire Ed Broking Group Limited, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker. Further details of the transaction were not disclosed.Under the terms of the agreement, BGC will acquire 100% of Ed, which includes broking operations under the Ed brand in UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Dubai, Miami and China; Ed's German marine broking arm Junge & Co. Versicherungsmakler GmbH; Ed's managing general agent operations Globe Underwriting Limited based in the UK; and Cooper Gay (France) SAS, which is based in Paris.Ed expects to report revenues of around $100 million in 2018. With the addition of Ed's brokers and back office personnel, Ed and Besso combined are expected to place approximately $2 billion of premium in 2018 and have approximately 300 combined brokers operating across 10 countries."
Does anyone know about the earnings and revs beat or miss?
"A bit surprised by the market action....but the updated/lowered range of guidance still says they make around $0.11/share this quarter. So, that sure seems to deserve a share price higher than yesteerday’s $2.40.Credit to them for following up and updating their quarter (as they have done in the past around the end of a quarter. Now, to wait for the Conference call in early November for details and guidance.."
"A nice beat, kept dividend in tact. I’ll keep DRIPing at 10.5%."
"only .47 cents away from new 52 week high, more likely then a new low, but the competition is taken market share from them, BGCP needs the money to higher expensive talent"
Will BGCP maintain its current cash dividend or will it be reduced after the spinoff?
owning bgcp and nmrk collecting a high % dividend between the 2 while watching them over the longterm appreciate in price handsomely is an absolute no brainer and the equivalent of a grand slam home run
Not looking good. I think we are sitting on a tired horse. Tax lose selling? See no catalyst for appreciation but will continue to hold. Not even worth holding for the dividend. Sad.
bgcp was much higher than this when it was paying as much as 72c a yr dividend..18c a quarter.. now that the earnings are staying within the company this should propel the stock to 10+ for fair value
"As a BGCP shareholder, I'm extremely pleased with today's announcement. Howard has previously signaled that he intended to dispose of the insurance brokerage business at some point in order to realize its value, and to focus on Fenics, but I expected that to occur a few years from now. The sale of the insurance business for half a billion dollars will enable BGCP to accelerate shareholder value creation. This is an example of how stock investors tend to serially undervalue BGCP's businesses, and how the stock price eventually gaps up when the businesses are monetized. Remember when Howard sold e-Speed to Nasdaq for more than the entire market cap of BGCP? In last quarter's conference call, BGCP management was pounding on the table, trying to drive home the case that significant value is being created in the fast-growing Fenics business. Maybe investors will finally get the message that management isn't just whistling Dixie. I have long believed that investors underestimate the growth potential of BGCP, and today's announcement validates my belief."
"Eoy update. BGCP closed @ $15.11, a measly 55% increase !!! What an Excellent year for Most Stocks. I look for more of the same in 2018. Tech, Financials and the Russell 2K. Get on board.A successful IPO for NMRK also.......$ 15.90 close."
A nearly 2% increase on ex-divvy ! $11.54 close. Perhaps the market is Finally getting it ! payday 9-5.
Company said they would likely update their quarterly earnings estimate by end of month !!
Next minor pop-dump everything.
do people actually think you were going to get newmark shares taxfree and bgcp would not depreciate significantly in price? just accumulate and take advantage of now more shares and 2 dividends..10yrs from now you will be laughing at yourself for not understanding.. just like i am laughing after benefitting the last 9 years
its a brokerage firm.. it has and always will make money as the house gets a % of all trades.. bgcp owns only human capital thru contracts and owns the electronics for person less execution.. thats a win win and more so given coronavirus
"In the past 6 months we are down 30% in spite of improving profits. But credit ratings have changed and the proposed spin off seems to be in suspended animation. I am a long term investor, but this is wearing out my patience. And the lack of guidance by Howard is unnerving. Definitely does not give one confidence going forward. Other comments?"
3 year stock performance -23.53 so keep telling yourselves this is a good long term investment.
hey I would like to buy this stock on Monday what you think should I buy or not
Accumulating cash...Is something up? Buying more companies or selling the one they have? News?
"Value stocks are going to be king after the air comes out of this bubble.That's what peeps don't understand.A lot of trapped investors here just praying for 5. Talk about low expectations, and failure to understand market cycles. We have already had a sneak preview of how fast a momentum bubble can deflate. The most hyped up stocks were cut in half or more in less than a MONTH. And this isn't even the real deal yet, just a sneak preview.Slowly and gradually smart money has been moving more and more into value over this entire time period - anyone notice the price action in BGCP today? almost 11% up? Not a coincidence people. Open your eyes!The tide will turn, and BGCP will become the new Tesla."
Forget the buybacks. Howard always talks about raising the share price / value. Stop giving free shares to execs and diluting the share price. Raise the divie. That will stimulate buying of shares.

"i added 22,000 shares last week @ 5.24 with the dividend its a no brainer..i have only added since i first owned in 2009..any purchases in the 5s and 6s will be home runs for long term owners"
Typical investor overreaction. Buy more and a month from now you'll be happy you did.
bgcp cheap here.. there will always be a need for brokers of products and as bgcp favors electronic platform profit margin will grow as will revenues once pandemic subsides..their costs are technology and human capital only. that said they will always make money(always have a positive EPS). at the very least at these prices they are a serious takeover candidate
twice the value as yesterday and up over 3% on ex dividend day on overall down market day pretty good
"Raymond James downgraded BGCP from strong buy to market perform on March 27, the day after the company updated the outlook for Q1.JasonS"
Some key points from BGCP-Priorities are to return capital to stockholders and to continue investing in high growth Fenics businesses-Focus on share and unit repurchases over dividends and distributions-Plans to reassess its current dividend and distribution with an aim to nominally increase it toward the end of the year
New article about BGCP released on Seeking Alpha today. Pretty comprehensive although they did not mention/discuss China Joint Venture. The current comments are mostly what have been discussed here but always worth reading what you can and debating it to learn more about what one owns.You can read the article and comments here: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406328-bgc-partners-boom-goes-dynamite
this stock traded at 16.97.. same business.. they added other elements that make money such as Fenics.. when espeed was sold the stock went from 4.5-5.75.. long before it went to 16.97.. and it was paying a div that varied from 56c a yr to 72c.. not 4c a year.. so i laugh at the latecomers like the concerned citizen critiquing it between 4 and 5... only a new person to bgcp or a novice would decide to sell this at 4.83-4.87.. 6 should be a floor.. upside is significant.. and yes if u bought at 2.50 and sold 4.83-4.87 thats a great trade.. but i added at 2.50 and its now 5.15 and selling is not an option in my educated opinion
No one wants to make a prediction on where this stock will be at the end of the month? When will it ever break out above $3.50?
"More games seemingly being played with share price...and I could understand the decline in later 2020 as tax loss selling. But, I don’t get why the recent news of + Affirmation of meeting guidance which shows very low P/E+ New customers & collaborators+ New Joint Venture in China+ News from last quarterly about Insurance division going profitable & Fenics growingHave not resulted in the shares going higher. Yesterday had a good recovery with volume...but it sold off later in the day and now down slightly today on a stronger up market day.So, here is my suggestion to Mgmt about capital return policy....focus on the dividend as a good dividend will stop the shorts and games as anyone short on the ex-dividend date has to pay the dividend on their shorted shares. The higher dividend alone would help the share price...and also stop the games from shorters. Who would short a company like this with lower P/E, good looking chart with share price now near 50 DMA support who affirmed guidance? But, we know some did in the first half of December (admittedly when the price was much higher than 50 DMA). We will know next week if they covered or kept shorting when the 2nd half of December, 2020 short volume is released.As a note, I did buy at year end so got some cheap shares which are now nicely profitable...and today sold some $4 Puts for Feb, 2020 for $0.40...which means I get shares for a net $3.60 (if share price is below $4) or get to keep the $0.40 and get no shares (share price over $4). I will continue to add on weakness."
Buying back $400M of stock or 20% of float!
Howard is the thinking of changing BGCP from partnership to C corp it could be a better way of doing business
"See where analyst EPS expectations (further down on page) have decreases due by a penny for the next two quarters and decreased by $0.03 for FY2021.Still, for a stock to earn $0.63/share in 2021 and to earn over $0.55/share in 2020, BGCP seems quite undervalued. But, as shown, revenues are supposed to be negative quarterly and annually as compared to a year ago quarter and year ago.BGCP needs a catalyst to move the share price higher....although I don’t know what that can/will be.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BGCP/analysis?p=BGCP"
There was huge put option activity on this a month ago. Almost $3 million out of the money puts bought on the ask in two trades. This is orders of magnitude above normal activity. Not made people place $3mill bets without knowing something.
"Thought I would start a new message thread...but appreciate the replies in the one below.Interesting that BGCP announced that they are borrowing (offering senior notes) to pay off $300 million in debt due in 2021. As per the PR: “ The notes are to be offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). BGC intends to use the net proceeds to repurchase, redeem and/or repay at maturity all $300.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes due 2021, including to pay the applicable redemption premium. Any additional net proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes.“So, is seems they will pay it off a bit ahead of time...although there may be a prepayment penalty of “applicable redemption premium”.So, why not just pay this off with cash on the balance sheet as they show ~$715 million cash on the balance sheet against $1.56 billion of debt? Will they actually save much money as there is a cost to this note offering? If they save 2%, that is only $6 million less any premium and cost of the note offering.My guess is that BGCP needs to extend that debt and wants to roll it out rather than actually pay if off. But, why borrow and pay interest when they have so much cash which can’t be earning even 1% in T-Bills?BGCP wants the cash for something and wants to roll the debt out for some reason. Any guesses? After cutting the dividend to a penny/quarter, it would seem they would have the money to pay the debt ahead of time without paying for a senior note offering and more interest for longer. Inquiring minds want to know. Perhaps someone asks a very pointed/specific question at the upcoming conference call. But, I don’t want to add more shares, even at this very low price, without knowing more about this.In summary, why borrow to pay this $300 million off vs. using money from the balance sheet as it would still leave BGCP with $415 million. They are paying money for the note offering and then seemingly extending the length of the debt so are paying more interest. What do they need their current balance of $715 million for?See their statistics at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BGCP/key-statistics?p=BGCP"
Howard Lutnick will be presenting on June 3 at Piper Sandler's conference. I think if he indicates good progress on quarter 2 then stock could move towards $3 level. The stock is indeed very cheap right now. Projected earnings for 2020 are 64c . So fwd PE ratio is only 4.1 times.
can some one explain why BGCP and Cantor Fitzgerald should not be one public company?
"BGC Partners, which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, posted revenues of $487.16 million for the quarter ended December 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.34%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $466.35 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters."
"I think chances are Big BGCP beats earnings...........I've been following for a few months and Finally jumped on board. I like what the managment said last quarter about drivers of earnings growth so in with more than 5,000 shares today."
Credit upgrade should be this month Fitch and S&P are staling so their buddies can accummulate more BGCP and NMRK shares Howard is building a great company He will do what Bazoes is doing for AMazon and Jobs did for Apple. Howard is driven like Elon Musk to change the world for the better
I’m buying with a 3 year investment horizon. And I think it will double in 3 years.
"Well, Howard owns 11 million shares. Do you think he wants dilution??"
Cantor Fitzgerald SPAC bringing AEYE public in a few months. BGCP may end up with a good position in that.
Hold patiently. Hasn't even attained 1/8 of its true value yet.market is playing a slow game.
Buying back stock with $500M Insurance proceeds will spike the stock price 22%!
"They met earnings, beat revenue and continued the $0.14/share dividend.Not bad."
If BGCP decide to go with a .10 dividend watch out. Could easily become a 10.00 stock.
better off with a bank stock than bgcp in this ultra-low interest rate market. what are you people thinking? i would be interested at$600M mrket cap ..it is still too expensive ..
"their year ago eps is not much higher than what is expected this year. so why the share price cut in 1/2 ? something doesn't add up. the market has recovered quite a bit, and there is a lot of trading volume. i hope the ceo gives more clarity on the earnings call. i would like to see a dividend increase. that would send a clear sign of confidence and boost the stock price...glta"
"--Goldman Sachs Adjusts Price Target for MarketAxess Holdings to $455 From $457, Maintains Neutral Rating"
with the new dividend rate for 2019 present yield is 10.7% As soon as my funds clear I'm buying more.
"unsure of what results of conversion to c corp will be. i like simplified structure, but i don't know what final outcome will be on share price and dividend. uncertainty is never good for a stock ..unless the market has already figured this out ..i am certainly lost.."
"Hedge funds are colluding to short this, they've deployed an army of bashers to broadcast pessimism on all the message boards - the smell of desperation, I love it! We could see a massive squeeze here any day now as these rats scramble to cover - these degenerate gamblers are over-leveraged as usual, and FUD is their only effective tool - or at least they hope it is effective.Prove them wrong - KEEP BUYIN as we rise!"
Who is selling ahead of $0.14/share dividend? I can understand selling after...but selling ahead of dividend means you don’t get the dividend...or have to pay it if you are selling it short. I should go look at the options to see what signal they are sending.Guidance seemed okay and the CEO said during conference call that they were committed to paying this dividend going forward.What are we missing here? Who is doing all this selling......and why?
"i see an end to the crisis ...a month or two for treatment options that mitigate the respiratory issues associated w/disease. still shortage of health workers, but some level of normalcy may return with increased diagnostic test available. a vaccine available next year 1Q or 2Q. the market it forward looking, so it will react prior to crisis being over..it will anticipate the end several months in advance. gl"
Going to be a HUGE WINNER for investors who hold. One of the only truly undervalued name in a market full of bloated flying p1gs!! Only stock you need really!!!
Can now buy shares just below $4 and sell March $4 covered calls for the bid of $0.60. That is a nice 15% gain in 6 weeks...and you will not lose unless the shares go below $3.40.
So what's the earliest we could see the Newmark shares?? Once the 180 day lock up expires in June I think. Also best guesses on how soon after expiration??
down today good time to add more shares Howard has big plans to be he best!
"BGC Partners (BGCP) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.11 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago."
"Market continues to climb higher in spite of the challenges and BGCP stays level. We are losing ground here shareholders. No appreciation, essentially no dividend, management needs to wake up. Buy more shares—not any time soon. Not until they have a plan and can explain it to the shareholders."
i think its little changed by end of day.. if it sells off i think given the stable position bgcp is in with fenics and corant contributing significantly this would be a great time to add to one's holdings
"Keep an eye on this stock and be ready to buy as it could easily double from here:+ BGCP sometimes announces revenue at end of quarter and ahead of earnings call. They sometimes give expenses or margin as indicator of earnings. Hopefully showing reasonable revenue (expectation is for $466 million) and the potential to meet/exceed earnings ($0.12 expected) would seem to be enough for this to go to $5/share as that is annualized around $0.50 in earnings and a 10 P/E.+ BGCP does have some insider ownership who should be interested in doing something to stimulate the share price. Cutting the dividend so severely dropped the share price. So, they need to talk about increasing the dividend in 2021 or buying back UNDERVALUED shares or something with their positive cash flow since they took the decision to refinance the debt. I might have preferred they had paid off some debt...but they decided to refinance it so do something with the $745 million on the balance sheet.=> At an estimate $1.20/yr EPS for 2020 & 2021 combined and their 314 million shares, that equates to $375 million in profits. Using 25% of profits to buy back shares would mean being able to buy back over 35 million shares at $2.50/share (12% of outstanding shares).+ BGCP should be much higher based upon earnings and P/E...so what will they do or say at the conference call to help shareholders? Again, talk about dividends or buybacks as there has been some shorting of shares in BGCP and those actions would force some shorts to cover.=> I don’t understand shorting this company as how much lower do they expect it to go...and suspect we will see some covering. But, management needs to do something here.If management doesn’t do or say anything to support the share price, BGCP may languish...so I would not buy until they do or say something bullish. Better to lose some upside than have money tied up in a stock not going anywhere.Having written this, I still don’t get the current share price....or how this trades under $5 so I am waiting to hear something and ready to pull the trigger and buy more shares under $2.50."
What price do you guys see this getting to?
DID ANYONE GET THEIR SHARES YET???
"hey, investors. bgcp is in financial services space, which benefits from rising interest rates. banks are up today. so is bgcp. we are going higher. energy, metals&mining, and financial services.... that is what you should be leveraged to going forward."
earnings friday should be as howard said on the high end of guidance
"BGCP is now officially the worst performer in my holdings. Even worse than my oil and gas holdings. Howard should be ashamed about his company’s performance. The employees should be ashamed. The downgrades, the destruction of capital all in the face of record markets. This company which makes money on market movements irregardless of direction. It should be at all time highs but instead is returning to all time lows. Management should be ashamed. Maybe a merger or sale should occur."
"Does anybody understand why BGCP is getting killed right now, with this insane volume in the market? Shouldn't BGCP be a beneficiary of this insane level of volume? I notice that other companies that benefit from high volume like VIRT are soaring during this market decline.And BGCP was already a ""deep value"" stock before this crash began.What am I missing here? What is it that is scaring people out of BGCP right now, leading to selling, when we'd expect buying???"
"No reverse split? Howard has said that if it were to happen, it would be during Q1 of 2019, which just ended. Any thoughts? The stock price has been doing very poorly lately. I think the uncertainty related to Brexit is one of the reasons.Jason"
Stock taking a dip. Any news?
so if u know the business and how uts trending as screens/technology trend toward how stocks trade and it gets applied to all of the platforms.. human capital gets phased out and costs go down and profit margin goes up to 75-85%.. where do u think thats puts the stock price of bgcp.. or like espeed.. fenics gets bought for an insane sum.. know the business and then comment
