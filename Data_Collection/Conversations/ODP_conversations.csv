why is this going up? lol
Look for a big partnership announcement by end of Q3. Trust me on this because the current model is dead and they have certain assets that are needed to compete vs Amazon
"Reverse split could spell disaster for your money. If you own 5000 shares now, after the split you could very well own only 500 shares. Theoretically, the price per share will be ten times higher after a 1 for 10 split, but how long does anyone really expect Office Depot to stay that high with the idiotic management decisions they make day in and day out?"
"I've also noticed that WB Mason which was one of Essendant's largest customers now has more SP Ricahrds products on their website which may be an indicator that they are moving their purchases to SP RIchards. That would align WB Mason closer to ODP since both companies would then share the same wholesaler (SP Richard's). An ODP, WB Mason, SP Richards roll up would be very interesting."
Apparently there is a big call for DSMs tomorrow at 1pm EST. Expected to be positive news internally.
"09/26/19 (THU) - This is the 4th day that this stock has done nothing but basically tread water. Breakout has gotta happen soon, and I'm betting it goes to the downward side. Yesterday I shorted 5000 shares at $1.69 each."
"This little bull run will end soon. As it always does. They come out with earnings that beat by one cent, they jump 10-20% making everyone hopefully, and fall back into the $2's shortly after. SAVE YOUR MONEY and find a company that is actually growing!"
"Back to school supplies and office supplies for $ODP with office Max and Compucom plus $BABA partnership online sales should accelerates, Think it’s very undervalued here, Staple offered $12 buyout a while back"
"I got in since $1.40 almost 2 months ago, what a run!"
Amazon deal probably worth 7+ a share.
on yahoo news today it said three strong stocks for august 15!!!!what happen to stock price
Office Depot has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) ~ Zacks Equity research. Thanks yahoo finance
earnings will be beat and up from then 
REVERSE SPLIT is going to come. Here the infohttps://officedepot.gcs-web.com/node/37016/html
I like the CompuCom purchase. Should kick start their growth into service side of their existing clients and bring on the new.
"Judges blocked Office Depot Staples merger, states it would be a monopoly......AT&T acquires Time Warner and nothing but the sounds of crickets from the crooked lobbying politicians..."
"10/10/19 (WED) - Nice increase today. Don't see any news to explain why though, so I'll believe this to be an opportunity I should take advantage of. Just shorted 5000 shares at $1.80 each."
mama's basement sewer dwellers still shorting for pennies. This will be $4 or higher soon. Little debt and still profiting during hard times. Shorts will get burned sooner than later. It's to the longs benefit that shorts can't read a quarterly report.
Beautiful.... GREAT DAY to all the longs that held this one... GLTA HERE !!!!!!!!
Just Added 40K shares
"2 weeks to earnings, looking for a beat and skyrocketing shares."
Insiders buying 100's of thousands of shares. Good sign?
"I sold ODP last year for a profit. I just bought ODP back today because the chart is looking good and the shorts are covering before earning. The new tax bill is gonna make office depot more profitable even if the revenue stay flat or decline. This is a strong buy and hold for dividend and share appreciation. Don't miss this bus or you will regret it, but don't put all eggs in one basket though, I only invest 2% cash per stock, don't invest more than you can afford to lose."
still looking good for the next couple of days. wave of positive news will continue coming...
What does it COST'EM to service that 3+ BILLION debt load each quarter.??
Hold!!
"Not a good sign the cfo is leaving, but doesn't this kind of thing happen all the time? Maybe AutoNation offered him more money. How do stocks typically trade after news of cfo leaving? I would assume there is a downtrend, but for how long?"
Well...don't worry Guys...Gerry Smith will be fired by August (Next Shareholder Meeting) and the new CEO will be Daniel Zhang (BABA)
"Earnings beat!... Enjoy the ride for the next few weeks/months to $3.00, and possibly higher!"
"Are there any serious investors on this site or is it just people pumping the stock? Can someone explain this to me? This year office depot has closed 165 stores. This is a fact, you can go to office depots website yourself and count the stores and you will see I'm right. Let's assume each store did $10 million in revenue a year. 165 stores times $10 million = 1.65 billion in revenue. So how is it possible office depot closes 165 stores, potentially worth $1 billion in annual revenue, yet last quarter they reported $2.5 billion in revenue, near the long term average? Someone please explain to me how you close 165 stores in a year but revenue barely changes."
Sold
Office Depot gets Garvey’sLeading Chicago area reseller Garvey’s Office Products is the latest office supplies dealer to be swayed by the current big-box acquisition strategyOffice Depot’s acquisition of Garvey’s comes after it bought leading Western US dealer Complete in October 2017 and New Mexico-based Sandia this March.
"ODP is bringing in billions, making millions,and gives a very generous dividend. Im sticking with this stock!!!"
"C'mon MM's, don't you think this was a bit overkill on the drop? I thought you had circuit breakers on over 10%! Or is that just stocks you're not manipulating and/or heavily invested in!"
"Why would not the dividends continue? Did anyone read the earnings report? They made money, even after the low guidance after quarter number 1. ODP beat the 2nd qtr even in this corrupt Wall Street scam environment. When things settle down again, this will go up."
Do you guys think this stock would go up in a few months when back to school starts ?
ODP awesome earnings...nice turn around story!
"What exactly is the amount per share for the dividend? I also see if I read it correctly, it pays on March 13th.... Is this correct?"
After reading about the 'FBI Investigation' and ONE reporters claim that this was the cause for the drop in share prices yesterday I at first had that knee jerk reaction to sell sell sell..... but upon further investigating on my own... it seems to me that this was something that happened 4 years ago. We have to be so careful in keeping ourselves educated to what is really going on but even in say tis I understand that most do not take the time to do this and buy and sell on others comments. This drives the Market and there are those that are so very aware of this fact and take advantage of it. Bottom line.... it is like Vegas...... roll the dice and hope that more people play fairly than those that don't.
$4 coming soon
"I finally sold my position for a modest gain after holding for about 2 years....this stock has been a laggard, unfortunately....may have a place in your portfolio, but don't expect massive gains here....there are much better options to put your money in.....now that I'm out, I wouldn't be surprised if it sky rockets"
BEST BUY IN THE MARKET TODAY1) B2B is a current focus for Amazon and competitors. Makes ODP a buyout target 2) WeWork IPO on 2019 will highlight Workonomy Office Space and ODP does not have to lease their own spaces and re-rent them- they already have massive underutilized Sq. Footage3) Alibaba addresses the Small Biz boom supplying products. Also make ODP a take-out target4) $100 M Buyback shows strong cash flow and is likely the large end of day buys that hold support5) Strong 2019 Cash Flow6) High Cash Balance and very reasonable debt levels with most financing a NON-RECOURSE loan7) Improved debt financing going forward8) CEO with proven results and an omni channel focus
A lot of positive. Momentum regained. Investor appreciation of retail distribution networks improving. Possible BABA expansion. Lease accounting rules will reflect favorably for ODP balance sheet - a cosmetic change but one the algorithms see as positive. Also noteworthy is ODP declines Palm Beach inventive money to maintain headquarters there which hints they wants flexibility for a buy out.
So is anyone buying? I bought at 2.07 today thinking the results were ok to see it drop to 2.0
"$10 by end of year very possible with earnings picking up as the year progresses. I would not be shocked to see this company enter into a major deal with someone like Amazon or Microsoft. If not, they're concentration on B2B is paying off with service revenue on the rise."
"Hey Guys... How you can see... S&P500 +1.20% and ODP is red and continues to struggle. My ""Low Price"" Takeover theory is still in place....I am sure Gerry Smith and the BOD took an agreement with the buyer .... and maybe with the Blackrock (the largest shareholder) So...I don't think we'll see any Price spike till the Offer...The uyer wants to buy CHEAP so...the price pressure will continue till the takeover. (4$?)...We'll see."
Holy volume last 2 minutes. Yay!!
"$ODP is very undervalued as Staples bid was $12 , but now have $BABA as a partner could push sales higher"
Can wait until this goes up a couple more cents so that I can sell this POS
i dont get why this stock goes down instead of goin up.
"Is office depot going bankrupt? All of a sudden they are closing a lot of stores right before xmas. I dont see any official announcements but several people have told me their stores are closing. Can't be a good sign closing stores before xmas, I'm tempted to short."
ODP is up 5.98% to 2.48
"sold my shares of odp they have a great div for a 2 dollar stock,but how long can that go on.and when I saw the news about the reverse split im out"
My guess is that the big boys are trying to scare people out of their shares. Stay long and strong.
"I was in a local Office Depot today to make copies. The store looks like it hasn't been updated since 1995. There were two copy machines for self-serve. They looked like they were from 1974. Only one of them worked, and that one kept jamming on the person using it. See ya. Quick trip up the road to a Fed-Ex Kinkos.Every time I'm in an Office Depot I wonder how they haven't gone BK yet. They're in the same physical condition as most Sears stores and have almost nothing in stock. I wouldn't buy this company with your money. Not a matter of IF they go bust, but when. Don't take my word for it. Go tour a couple of stores."
Exited my position today. I don't like holding during mergers and acquisitions. Thank you Staples for making this trade possible. Good luck to all of you on the ride. Hitch up your saddle.
"Back to $6.00 by the end of 2018. At 7 times earnings with a decent dividend, it's way undervalued."
"Something fishy going on here. Did they not know they'd miss before approving a 100 million buyback? Or did they wait for this to drop to get cheaper? Also, now this is starting to get manipulated by the mm's. This should not have dropped this much based on today's news. Even with the miss, it's still not that bad, and with Alibaba, it does not warrant this type of drop. The rigged system continues."
ODP is up 5.45% to 2.13
Adding here to $ODP Think will see growth accelerates now that $BABA partnership is in place
Office Depot Announces Successful Debt Repricing and New $100 Million Stock Repurchase ProgramDate(s): 11/20/2018 7:00 AM• Borrowing Rate on Term Loan Reduced by 175 Basis Points • Outstanding Debt Balance Reduced by Approximately $200 Million • Expect Annual Net Interest Expense Savings of Approximately $21 Million • Authorized to Repurchase up to $100 Million of Common Stock
So: Adjusted EBITDA 560M$ (just 2.7 times its market value) Free Cash Flow 450M$ (just 3.3 its market value) Net Debt just 50M$. Cash on hand 925M$. Market value......1.5B$ Number od shares: 549 million! With those number its fair value should be 15$ per share....considering Amazon Valuation ODP value should be around 100$ per share 
Nice move today new highs coming soon
"Compucom has always been a poor performer. Just ask its employees. As noted there are structural issues with Compucom in particular and untill ODP makes the changes at Compucom that are needed, the stock will not rise above $3."
"This will be up a buck to a buck and a half by end of the year for a nice little profit, plus get a decent dividend while waiting."
It seems that the Stock Price prssure will continue till the LOW PRICE Takeover...I guess Gerry Smith already made the price agreement...
"Just Buy and forget, $10 in few weeks"
"Almost all bad trends for this company.-Year over year net income since ’16 dropped from 529 to 181 to 104.-Operating income also dropping 462 to 433 to 365-On-going negative cash flow.-Total liabilities of 4040 vs current assets of 2683 (assuming the receivables can be collected)-No growth – closing stores and consolidating the organization-They can only cut expenses so much to try and prop up net income but they have pretty much whipped that horse as much as they can.-Stock price so low that most funds and institutions are not allowed to own it since they are not allowed to own equities at less than $5. The ones that do own it won’t have buyers to step in and buy it.-Insiders unloading their options at whatever they can get for them. -Management floundering without what appears to be a coherent strategy that can be successfully executed – they bet big on the CompuCom acquisition and that is proving to be a disaster and negative drag along with their previous initiatives.-Losing share to competitors in all of their sectorsListen, I have no position in this stock anymore but virtually everything points to this on-going disaster to continue. The overall market has been way up and yet ODP is way down. What is going to happen to this stock when there is an overall market correction or a recession? There is virtually nothing positive about this company’s stock so be very cautious of any money you put into it. It can and unfortunately probably will go much lower. Best case, a buyer steps in and takes them private which is the only way this stock goes up in the near term."
Why a company with profit is being treated like one filing for bankruptcy?
ODP will be part of BABA next year. Expect a takeover price of $15/share
"Thanks ODP, been shorting the company and it has paid off nicely! Closing my position to lock in the gains but my analysis sees an on-going drop ahead. Bankruptcy is possible due to on-going mismanagement."
As I wrote...the Huge Issue of this Stock s that Shareholders buy one day and sell the day after. ...
What's going on with this stock??
This is simply a rumor I've heard but supposedly 3 large independent Office Services companies are working with a PE group to evaluate buying ODP. The challenge which is obvious is that the PE group doesn't want the retail division.
Something is going to happen I guess...Gerry Smith sold his Mansion in Florida (and he gained 3M$ in just 3 years!...I guess he is a better real estate agent than a good Ceo. He didn't list his mansion so...I think he didn't want to alarm the stockholders... CFO is leaving... Is something going to happen? Is Gerry Smith going to quit within a few days?https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/office-depot-ceo-makes-3m-in-sale-of-south-florida-home-he-never-listed-209586
"Has there been any news on the store closings? Office Depot is silently closing stores without any announcements. It reminds me of how Sears went from 400 stores to 100 with almost no announcements. To find out how many stores are closing I checked the in store price on SKU 7351473. This is a greeting card that appears to be only discounted at going out of business stores. 82 stores have this discounted. That implies to me office depot is currently closing 82 stores, that is a lot more than the 50 they close every year, and I believe this is addition to the 50 stores they closed earlier this year. If I am correct that would be around 132 stores closed this year alone! The reason sears went bankrupt is because they had a high debt load and kept closing stores, reducing revenue and making it hard to pay off the debt. I see a similiar scenerio with office depot - too much depot, closing a lot of stores, it's going to be hard to pay off that debt. Has management addressed how many stores they are closing this year in total?"

"The ODP Corporation Announces Completion of Office Depot Holding Company Reorganization and Reverse Stock SplitThe ODP Corporation (“ODP” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ODP), a leading provider of business services, products and digital workplace technology solutions through an integrated B2B distribution platform, announced that it has completed its previously announced holding company reorganization creating a newly-formed public company named “The ODP Corporation” and implemented a 1-for-10 reverse stock split effective June 30, 2020.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200701005216/en/ODP-Corporation-Announces-Completion-Office-Depot-Holding"
Its that time of year again back to school shopping and Office Depot is doing great things for communities discounting school supplies for people to donate to future generations! Say what you want but ODP is a great company that does great things!
"Currently, this stock is at a steep discount. Should be trading in the low $4's"
"The few posting on this board seem to be in complete denial. There is not that much shorting on this stock based on the data available to us. Anyone that is shorting it is not out to make 40k people lose their jobs, they're out to make some $ on their investments like you are doing when you buy long. The company has been authorized for a stock buyback for quite some time and while they don't always publicize when the execute the buyback, it is likely that they have fired that barrel multiple times already.The truth sure seems to be that this company is in multiple businesses where time has passed them by and the leadership has been unable to pivot to a new direction to overcome this. Retail brick and mortar stores are a losing proposition demonstrated by their repeated store comps for the last how many years. Amazon is crushing that part of their business model.The print business is another dying breed. The world has been moving away from printing stuff because it is inefficient and environmentally poor among other reasons. Another business that is going down. Their attempt to provide office space might have had some promise but that business is already grabbed by competitors that have that as their core competency, something Depot doesn't have.Compucom is another disaster as was expected by those paying attention. This move alone has now blown away their major cash reserves and brought on a load of debt to the company that will hasten their downfall.Their alleged bright spot is their BTB business but again, that is likely going to trend poorly fairly quickly as Amazon continues to ramp that up. Even Staples, under new ownership, will likely take market share from these guys.Remember, their dismal performance has occurred during the longest economic expansion in most of our lifetimes. When an inevitable recession comes, that's what will do away with those 40k jobs and this company will likely go away. Yes, they are paying their dividend this time but when you look at their debt and their negative cash flow numbers for the past year- that will end up getting cut at most in two more quarters unless they somehow turn their cash flow around. That seems quite unlikely.Stay invested in this stock and you might get lucky but why would you when there are so many other stocks for strong companies that are depressed with the recent market pullback. You'll likely see them under $1 before you see $2 and $4 for this stock is a pipe dream."
ready for another 8% spike?
I recently purchased this stock (ODP) and am a bit confused as to why it is not doing well at all. Can anyone give me a History lesson on this? I see comments about the CEO and board but I see that with any stock that is doing poorly. Is there something specific I've missed? Thanks for any I/P
"so my brother and I have Robinhood and today office Depot at 4 a.m. he said went up to $16 a share and then when he woke up and said his account was negative like 23,000 but I told him he can't sell at 4 a.m. because Robinhood only lets you buy between the hours of 6 and 3 p.m. but maybe it's possible you can buy and sell at 4 a.m. we've just never tried it do you guys know if Robinhood or the market actually opens at 4 a.m. and you can buy and sell can anyone please respond and let me know"
good news comes out and odp gets dumped and it was a lot of shares
Demand board be ousted !
"With positive Q4 earnings and recent Alibaba collaboration, I see great upside potential. Such a bargain buy at these levels."
Relative to the market .... The performance has been beyond pathetic. CEO has zero business running a public company. I don't think board understand s the concept of shareholder value !
"What makes this stock attractive from a sales perspective? FAX machines and copiers are dead, printers are becoming more and more obsolete, ""modems"" and routers are provided by cable/phone companies, one can buy office chairs and coffee makers on Amazon as cheaply as anywhere. Yeah the P/E looks ridiculously low but if I can't justify the earnings it's got now, I can't in good conscience buy this stock. What am I missing? Don't just talk fluff about confident smart management or innovatively transitioning, what are they going to sell a ton of to stay alive?"
Bring in New management !!
Beat expectations... value drops...
"Getting more and more excited about ODP. Great balance sheet, improved cash flow, handled the Covid very well. They ar a partner for home and remote offices. I cam see an AMZN takeover without too much antitrust concern given Staples. And it fits AMZN much more than AMC or JCP??? Amazon realizes they need a larger retail presence too battle WMT which is coming for their jugular. Right, DC?"
From up 8% to now down 6%. Weeeee. Rollercoasters are fun at the park not so much in the stock market
possible short squeeze?
"Folks Office Depot is heading to $7 from here, glad I held on to my 26,789 ODP shares"
"$ODP is 95% owned by institutions for a total of 516,264,791 shares. The public owns under 5% with 26,082,552. What does that tell you? Oh, and Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, and The Vanguard Group, the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds in the world (only to Blackrock), own a combined 25%. They are not in the business of losing money."
correction i guess?
here we go! 3.50 will be right around the corner.....
"Just to think about: From Office Depot 8K - ""we expect to receive approximately $80 million when the Timber Notes Receivable and the Non-Recourse debt will be net settled in the next twelve months (1st quarter 2020). In addition, as previously noted in the Income Taxes section discussion, we expect to receive a refund of unutilized AMT credits of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. - That means 120M$ Cash coming by 1st Quarter 2020."
Well not a blow out quarter like last one but going in the right general direction.. Just need to reject the buyout offer and move forward
I give it about 2~3 yrs to get there act together... Office depot can succeed but not operating the way it is currently... if they don't turn it around in a few years it will most likely go under or be bought out for pennies
Great team of management Moon tomorrow.
SP Richards and ODP merger?
A nice finish today 1.97! Afterburners ignited expecting it to slam through 2 tomorrow!!!
Slow move up. $3+ next earnings. Then zoom takeoff from there. Will need one more earnings call to see if new plans take hold with good results. Shorty beware.
13 dollars per share coming soon

ANOTHER $100 M BUY BACK ANNOUNCED. High Free cash flow. Good 2019 Prospects. High Cash Balance. Low Debt.Expect a 50 cent move in the next few days on under the radar slow accumulation rather than an immediate bounce.
"In case you have read about recent buyers of ODPDavid Einhorn's Greenlight Capital took sizable new stakes in the beaten down retailer Office Depot ODP as well as the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch ANF during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.The hedge fund reported holding 2.1 million shares of Office Depot and 212,500 shares of AbercrombieHappy trading"
"Just to Think about (2) If ODP is so bad why did Institutionals increase their net positions by more than 16M Shares in the last 3 months? Why did Blackrock, Vanguard, Hotchkis bought (together) over 14M ODP Shares if this company destiny is to fail? Just hink about...nothing else. I guess this huge funds are a bit smarter than us or, at least...they have more info than us. https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/odp/institutional-holdings"
"The numbers are solid, it has no serious concerns on the horizon, it could build a bigger market from its efforts with Alibaba, or Compucom, and it has a Dividend. Until this goes back up over $2 a share it is a good stock to invest in."
Good job! This was on my watch list but I never bought. This is going to inch it's way back to $5.00 easily.
"Wait...(1.) The CompuCom debacle happened years ago...and (2.) Walmart fired CompuCom years ago, and (3) This issue happend even before Office Depot got involved in this company. Yesterdays reaction was to OLD news. Some people who sold are going to be mad at the reporting lapses on the timeframe of this issue."

office depot was one of them in the article as strong buy
Congrats to bagholders LOL. Im buying @ $0.99
Good time to load up before earnings.....Expedia moved up nicely in pre-market today....ODP will probably do better....My guess is $3 a share when earnings report is released at the end of the month
"According to my data, office depot has closed 165 stores this year. And yet it seems investors dont care, the media doesnt care, no one seems to care? That's about 10% of their total stores in less than a year. And yet you want me to believe the company is doing great, making a lot of money? Something is not adding up. Below is my data for the past year, of the total number of office depot stores. I used the public office depot store locator.Office Depot total number of stores by date:8/24/18: 1,3668/18/19: 1,3171/31/20: 1,3175/31/20: 1,2987/24/20: 1,2549/27/20: 1,24210/25/20: 1,24211/4/20: 1,24211/18/20: 1,152"
"I see Cramer is now trashing ODP ... saying it is a value trap and not to but it. This is the same guy that said to buy Windstream (WIN) a few years ago. I did buy WIN and they are now filing Chapter 11 and I lost my savings on this deal. When Cramer thows out these 'suggestions; and really misses the mark he just shrugs his shoulders, pushes a noise buzzer and says ""oh well"". I cant' understand why anyone flows his gibberish."
"Well, this is a disappointing way to start the day. I'm not selling. But it is upsetting to wake up to this mess...... again."
"This is crazy, went to Teo different Office Depots in San Diego California to purchase label tape, both locations were closed, how is Office Depot going to make money. Hope they improve their online sales, if not they will be in huge trouble. Though it wouldn’t surprise me if Office Depot gets purchased by Amazon."
Green on a red day.. Looking good very good here.. GLTA true longs here !!!!!
Does amazon own any part in yahoo or interest in yahoo?
"I wouldn't buy this stock now. Their subsidiary Compucom just had layoffs that crippled their Sales teams ability to sell to existing customers let alone create new sales. Until they reverse their decision on the layoffs, this company will continue to under perform for a long time."
Note retail stores have had negative comps since 2008. Stores averaged over $7 million in 2008 probably averaging about $3.4 million and that includes closing over 500 stores that lost money or overlapped when they bought Omax. They have had negative comps enemies with transferred sales from closing stores. There next problem is that many stores are on low rent as theses leases were done in 1990’s. Most leases have 30 years so all the high volume stores r probably in areas where they can not afford to renew under current market rents especially in CaliforniaIt is just a matter of time before retail is no longer a viable option. They will lose leases in high density urban area most stores in suburban areas. This is why the we works concept in a store is a losing proposition not enough density. This concept is a slow death by a thousand wounds.
"Lower highs, higher lows. It's coming to a pass now, maybe a serious uptrend can properly begin now"
"Expect the RAD AMAZON deal to have a spillover on ODP as hedge funds realize the distribution benefits of a large network of stores and in ODP’s case with modest debt, strong Cash flow, and improving B2B. Is ODP the cheapest most overlooked stock on the market caught the fake malaise if quant funds tricked by lease recognition accounting changes and artificially inflated debt numbers. Watch for a quick 20% POP"
"Actually, continuing to pay their dividend with their on-going negative cash flow and mounting debt is probably corporate and executive malfeasance that might allow investors to recoup some pennies on their investments when the litigation against ODP kicks in."
"Give it a couple quarters with $BABA partnership and will be to the moon, I’m buying dips here"
Alibaba buy out of ODP? for distribution center to make a play for a foothold to compete in us market. ebay amazon. Focusing on the US asian market to start.is this a viable move? anyone
"Office Depot is fine, its primary reach is to businesses online, they deliver just like Amazon right to the doorstep, they have partnered with Alibaba, their 'retail' stores are only a small part of what ODP is. Consider them to be distribution centers with a sales department and that is a better picture for what Office Depot is."
@KOKOY.... :) Thomas H. Lee Partners was the OWNER of Compucom and they got 42M Stocks when they sold Compucom to Office Depot 
"Wow, Institutions are loading"
This management team deserves to be recognized for how they've managed to navigate digital era headwinds. Growing B2B business and clean balance sheet. Tangible book is $4.
"My guess -- some institution had a big position, saw the uptick this morning, and put out the direction to dump the entire position on the uptick, knowing that it would start trending down in a serious way because of it. Once that plays out there should be a rebound. The downside risk here is small so I picked up some shares before the close."
"I have read an Article (On Yahoo) about ODP Debt and it is totally WRONG...I don't know how are some people allowed to write ... Let's just talk about the CURRENT Liabilities (I mean ALL the money that Office Depot should pay within the next 12 months...I mean ALL...)OFFICE DEPOT Total Current Liabilities (Due within 12 months) (3,181B$) Total Current Assets (Money they are going to have within 12 months) :3,389B$ so...NO problems at all!

There must be some options coming due next week in low 2 range as the stock is being sold off on a terrific day. People with money are manipulating this stock as they the entire BS stock market. It's all smoke mirrors for the people in the know.
Alibaba seems to be doing extremely well. Perhaps ODP will also benefit from the relationship with BABA.
Is ODP Expensive or Cheap? Numbers to find a cheap stock.P/E between 15 and 20 ODP P/E = 6.3 - Price/Cash Flow between 15 and 20. ODP P/Cash Flow = 2.8 - Total Debt to Current Assets should be less than 1.1 ODP Total Debt/Current Assets = 0.27 - Current ratio should be above 1.5. ODP Current Ratio = 1.51 - Price/Book Value should be less than 1.2 ODP Price/Book Value = 0.53 You decide if ODP is Expensive or Cheap.
"I bot today. Could not resist. Chart, volume, and call action screams higher prices ahead."
Great opportunity
Reverse head and shoulders setting up on chart. Stay long.
Ready for a big pop after earnings.
I’m buying 3000 shares for $3.29. Anyone think bad news about China that was just released will bring the price down on Monday? (I’m buying after hours.)
"$3 next stop, buy buy"
The results are very very good. They are cutting useless stores and useless revenue (Even in Compucom) and they are increasing profit! : Full Year 2019 EPS (GAAP) is now 0.18$- Year Dividend is 0.10 Payout Ratio is 55% which is very good.Next quarter they'll have 750M$ Cash and just 670M$ long term Debt cause the Timber Note has ben canceled. They reduced the number of stocks to 535M and now Office Depot Book Value is 4.06$ per share vs 2.35$ !! They are managing their Balance Sheet very very well.
Amazon buy odp before alibaba or bidu takeover
selling at 3.11 someone buy my shares.
Moody's has decided to withdraw the ratings for its own business reasons. The company fully repaid the it senior secured term loan
Let me understand. The Reverse Split starts today at 4:01 p.m. but Yahoo has ALREADY adjusted the price!!!
amazon buy out.. don't be shocked.
At Office Depot People are buying a huge amount of sanitizer because of Coronavirus. I guess revenue will be higher next quarter!
FYI the stock in the chart is ROKU which we all know has been in the spotlight with retail investors.
"Retail Operating Income down 59% in Q2 vs LYCompucom Operating Income down 83% in Q2 vs LY .... Compucom was supposed to be a key enabler to there much self-promoted ""B2B Transformation"""
"Staples offered $12/shares buyout of $ODP but now they have a giant partner in Ali $BABA and China market will give $AMZN real competition in the market place, Think we’re very undervalued here"
Factors in the upcoming weeks. 1. Short Squeeze can come into play.2. Sycamore partners makes their tender offer $60 range directly to shareholders
"Office Depot will be past &14 per share within the next two years, mark my word"
Holding strong in this market. Dips below 3 I'll add.
"This failing stock can afford to alienate the people who watch Fox news? I know I won't buy anything from there again... just like from any company who chooses to enter the political fray. Your job is to provide a product that people want, not affect someone's free speech."
"Don't be fooled by artificial price depression. Office Depot has delivered over 39.4% year on year earnings growth in the past 5 years, and share price is $1.86 vs Future cash flow value of $4.63. With almost 95% institutional ownership led by Blackrock, Inc., we will see it rise after earnings."
03/09/20 (MON) - Sooooooo happy to see ODP finally drop under $2 per share. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel after 5 and a half months!!
any idea what is happening here?
"good earnings ,good price, huge volume.."
Shorts try hard to press down so They can cover at cheap price. ODP is still profitable and it has plenty of cashes. This may be an opportunity to add more shares. GLTA longs.
strong buy did they read the sec filing duh share dumping
"Wow, Thomas H. Lee partners bought 42,738,234 shares , Huge, Is this the same Tom Lee in CNBC ? $BABA partnership maybe the reason, Upside is coming"

honest take.....who thinks this will go any lower than $2.40 if they miss earnings?
The Markets and Investing have changed. It is no longer about buying stock to 'invest' in a company but more about 'grab the cash and dash' mentality. I am beginning to think that you either change your personal investment rules or you lose out unless you can hold out for years for a possible change in strategies again. . Or just don't invest.
Does anyone know why ODP has been getting hit for the past couple of sessions while the market has headed up? I bought in at $2.49. Thanks!
ODP breakout just began market cap of $1.5B is a joke should be $10B to the future
"Office Depot should be at $7 per share, not a measly $2.50 per share"

"ODP loses 1 billion market cap on one divisions 15 million dollar loss, but will still turn a quarterly profit as a whole. And this market is not rigged by the MM's? Instead of wasting time on Trump, they need to go after these thieves."
"Office Depot Q1 Adj. EPS $0.120 Beats $0.070 Estimate, Sales $2.700B Beat $2.670B Estimate"
"The potential in ODP isn't about them selling their office products online and going head to head with the likes of Amazon. The way ODP is going to dramatically increase their valuation is by transitioning the transactional nature of the business to a recurring revenue model. They'll do this by leveraging their existing B to B clients and selling them ""managed services"" which will lock in a revenue stream. The 28% increase in their service revenue is what I think the street enjoyed seeing...."
"Thank you $PYPL for growth, loading in $ODP for a rocket someone bought a $14M worth of stock, is a buyout coming?"
"Can anyone tell me how stock buybacks typically handled? Would I be correct to assume that this is spread out throughout the course of the year so as not to jolt the price in a way that would encourage short sellers to take advantage of sudden price swings? I mean, how are these programs usually executed? I'm just bored and curious. Thanks."
"Per yahoo details, Insiders purchased 2.5 million shares and sold 0 shares in the last 6 months. The CEO owns the most of all insiders with 3.2 million, the CFO owns over 1 million. I think bith would prefer their shares to be worth $10 a share rather than $0."

Taking bets here on how long before this drops back below $5. I’m guessing by late September. Who else?
"Compucom employe: now we are going to using Office Depot locations to pick up parts to perform our work. All I can say is we do get emails each year showing how we're making more money than the previous year. We support Target, T-Mobile, Winn-Dixie, Aetna, Cigna, Home Depot, Lowes, Omnicare PNC, SunTrust, Wells Fargo, BMO, All state, and a lot of other smaller businesses. I plan on picking up a 100 shares just to hold."
Office Depot and Alibaba.com Form Strategic Collaboration to Serve U.S. Businesses. This is very interesting....Maybe BABA want to get INTO The USA MArket with more power!https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190304005466/en/Office-Depot-Alibaba.com-Form-Strategic-Collaboration-Serve
"With Office Depot acquiring CompuCom, this makes Office Depot a technology company as well, expect great things folks, I use to be a network engineer at CompuCom and it was a fine company with many contracts with the US Military and Government, this will help Office Depot’s earnings. My guess is the Office Depot should be in the $9 to $12 range within the next couple of years"
Last earnings boost was almost entirely due to massive sales of home office furniture during the beginning of the pandemic. I'd imagine the next earnings report will be abysmal.

Looking very good this a.m. More to come IMHO... GLTA true longs here !!!!!
maybe why Gerry sold masion in fl and mr lever left they know buyout is near
"CFO just bought 20,000 shares. Looking good."
"In 2015, Staples was willing to buy ODP for $6B+. The government blocked it. Since then, in a mostly good economy and a great environment for stocks, ODP's management has managed to drive the value of the company down to $2.1B and far below that prior to this offer. I'm sure the short term investors will be pleased with the resulting pop in the stock's price from this offer but the longs have mostly been crushed on this stock. Too bad for them and the employees that will lose out in this deal. Meanwhile, management will likely walk away with a large bonus for their ""efforts"". What a shame."
baba earnings is on the 15th... think it will have any affect on odp?
Happy fathers day.. This article from barrons really highlights why ODP is a strong buy and hold. ODPs valuation could potentially be 6 times higher than what it is imo.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/undervalued-office-depot-could-rise-20-to-60-1522185924
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compucom-partners-intel-remote-endpoint-170000657.html
"ODP will be back on track quickly. The Pre Announcement was only a slight downward revision of ONE division. Rather than damage management credibility, it shows they are on top of things and are willing to hand the market fairly immediate updates visibility Still they indicated $65M adj earnings. When they report, they will maintain year guidance, report strong cash flow and NOW they have the opportunity to employ the pre-announced buyback to boost EPS. This is will be a $4 stock within a few months and this mini crash will be viewed as a GREAT BARGAIN"
I need amazon to buy ODP
I hope they will merge with Home Depot to become Home Office Depot.
ODP is up 6.51% to 2.78

ODP Enterprise Value/EBITDA is 169.94This is overvalued by factor of 25x (EV ebitda ~7x) which means that true value of the stock little bit over 1 dollar.
bought at 3.50 hope to get from underwater
I think people are really over reacting on their sells. Can't imagine they are making money by selling.

"Market cap is worth more than $814m to a buyer. ODP’s BtoB business is worth more than $1B. That being the case, there’s low risk on the downside with higher upside. Other retailers with last Mike delivery would layer on ODP’s business to their platform. $3 price target..."
Likely exceed earning
$EROS HONEST QUESTION: What if Management decides to screw us and do a reverse stock split? This will help raise money for more movie production and make the stock more attractive to institutional investors? They did this with $ODP Office Depot. I’m bullish but I can see it happening since management could care less about retail investors. As you can see with the price action these past two days.
It's like a roller coaster now. Up and down and up and down and up again. Sold at 2.08 and waiting for 2 to ride again.
$4 right around the corner
"ODP is dirt cheap here, Staples bid was $12 , now partnered with $BABA and with revenues of $12B plus profits rising, should rebound hard next earnings"
Below 3$ here we are....This was a very strange Profit Warning...considering that 1 month ago Gerry Smith was VERY optimistic and in just 1 month....everything changed!
"Office Depot stock needs to go to the emergency room immediately after losing 50% of its market value in less than 3 months . Board of directors , CEO Gery Smith and Executives you all should be ashamed for doing nothing to stop the stock price bleeding as if all of Don’t exsi or living in a different world .Do you have to wait for your shareholders to write you a litter asking you to start an immediate shares buyback to stop the stock bleeding .All of your bonuses should be suspended for this year . You should also get a pay cut "
This is the TEAL reason of ODP crash. Compucom is investigated by FBI!!! https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/business/walmart-fbi-investigation.html
Holding.
"I worked in ODP BSD for 8 years. Forget all of the analytics-Bad leadership, Bad business model, and a Bad industry. I have never worked for a more dysfunctional company in my entire 30 year sales career. Nobody trusts anybody at ODP and that is an ominous sign. FYI-I was not part of the 500 salesperson layoff (firing). I wised up and left in '17."

$5 we go this week..going to $10 soon
My guess is FedEx’s earnings report hurt ODP.
26 million shares trades Friday has to be good news avg vol 4 million leaked news
This is a big deal !
"25M$ fine is not a big deal considering that Office Depot has 660M$ Cash, positive earnings and 11B$ Revenues. Anyway this news is about an Investigation between 2009 and November 2016...that means that it's another old news...well...FTC decided now about the fine to apply but it's not a fine for something that happened now... https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/03/office-depot-computer-scans-gave-fake-results"
"92% are held by institutions. Company wants to buy back 7% of the outstanding common stock. Dividend is at 3%. Paying down debt. Sounds like a stock that needs to be moving up, not down. Almost 5% of the shares are short. ODP is ripe for a buyout, by someone else other than Staples."
odp pays a 4 percent dividned and what about the buyback should push odp higher Alibaba should just buy them
WILL AMAZON SCOOP UP ODP TO NOT ONLY INCREASE B2B but block BABA from infiltrating the US Market
ODP market cap $1.2B could rocket 10X
"It's stocks and situations like these that make smart investors rich, not talking shorts or hedging, but Long."
"Just when someone calls a bottom, someone else gets out a backhoe and starts digging."
Private Equity firms and Best Buy looking seriously at buying Office Depot. Great synergies and added corporate market presence.
I love the upward momentum. Shop there all the time.
Up 2.5% today. Hold on as this roller coaster clicks up to the peak!
Took a small position in this stock today. Looks like this may be a good blend for both Office Depot and Alibaba. I rarely buy a stock that is less than $5.00 per share. With a little luck and some work this one will hit $5.00 some time in the near future. At this price and the small dividend it pays. I figure it is a buy.
"It doesnt make sense. My recommendation: sell everything you own, max out your credit cards, mortgage the house, and buy odp stock at these prices. I don't have the courage to do it myself, but you'll be glad you did. Just my humble opinion."
"told u here comes 3.30 a,share"
"Average Price to Cash Flow (P/CF) for the stocks in the S&P 500 is 14.05. But just like the P/E ratio, a value of less than 15 to 20 is generally considered good.(Nasdaq.com) ODP Price to Cash flow is 5! That means that if ODP Price to Cash Flow was 14 its market value should be 5B$ (that means 9.16$ per share)"
Office Depot has been doing all the right things and their stock is about to soar put on your seatbelt this next earnings is going to be a huge beat this stock has a nice dividend at a great price.
A sign in the right direction:https://www.opi.net/news/region/002-europe/pbs-holding-to-buy-depot-subsidiaries/
"Was interested to add this to my portfolio then checked out their website and i am out. They are living in the past, a 7 year old can build a better website these days. Big turn off"
How low will it go??
$ODP is dirt cheap $1B market cap with $12B of revenues with $BABA partnership could rebound very hard
