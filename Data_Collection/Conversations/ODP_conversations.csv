Office Depot and Alibaba.com Form Strategic Collaboration to Serve U.S. Businesses. This is very interesting....Maybe BABA want to get INTO The USA MArket with more power!https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190304005466/en/Office-Depot-Alibaba.com-Form-Strategic-Collaboration-Serve
So is anyone buying? I bought at 2.07 today thinking the results were ok to see it drop to 2.0
"BABA announcement soon. The original deal on March 4 included a 120 day trial, so an announcement of an update - continuance or expansion - is likely any day. That will boost the stock."
"If someone is on here bashing the last quarter, just know they are the ones shorting the stock, trying to get people to sell.. I think this should be obvious to investors.. this stock is imo extremely undervalued and Gerry Smith is doing a great job as ceo"
"10/10/19 (WED) - Nice increase today. Don't see any news to explain why though, so I'll believe this to be an opportunity I should take advantage of. Just shorted 5000 shares at $1.80 each."
"I have read an Article (On Yahoo) about ODP Debt and it is totally WRONG...I don't know how are some people allowed to write ... Let's just talk about the CURRENT Liabilities (I mean ALL the money that Office Depot should pay within the next 12 months...I mean ALL...)OFFICE DEPOT Total Current Liabilities (Due within 12 months) (3,181B$) Total Current Assets (Money they are going to have within 12 months) :3,389B$ so...NO problems at all! Asset/Liabilities Ratio: 1.22AMAZON Current Liabilities: 69,678 - Amazon Current Assets: 76,790 - Assets(Liabilities Ratio:1.10So...Office Depot Ratio is better than Amazon Ratio!WALMART: Current Liabilities: 80,283B$ - Current Assets: 61,371B$ - Assets/Liabilities Ratio 0.76 (VERY BAD cause below 1!!!) In Theory Walmart is not able to pay the dent within the next 12 months..."
"The numbers are solid, it has no serious concerns on the horizon, it could build a bigger market from its efforts with Alibaba, or Compucom, and it has a Dividend. Until this goes back up over $2 a share it is a good stock to invest in."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
"In case you have read about recent buyers of ODPDavid Einhorn's Greenlight Capital took sizable new stakes in the beaten down retailer Office Depot ODP as well as the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch ANF during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.The hedge fund reported holding 2.1 million shares of Office Depot and 212,500 shares of AbercrombieHappy trading"
"Office Depot is fine, its primary reach is to businesses online, they deliver just like Amazon right to the doorstep, they have partnered with Alibaba, their 'retail' stores are only a small part of what ODP is. Consider them to be distribution centers with a sales department and that is a better picture for what Office Depot is."
"Board of Directors has adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan (the “Rights Plan”) and declared a dividend of one right (“Right”) for each outstanding share of Company common stock as of the record date. The record date for the dividend is May 21, 2020. The Rights Plan expires, without any further action being required to be taken by the Office Depot Board of Directors, on May 4, 2021."
"$10 by end of year very possible with earnings picking up as the year progresses. I would not be shocked to see this company enter into a major deal with someone like Amazon or Microsoft. If not, they're concentration on B2B is paying off with service revenue on the rise."
honest take.....who thinks this will go any lower than $2.40 if they miss earnings?
"CFO just bought 20,000 shares. Looking good."
"25M$ fine is not a big deal considering that Office Depot has 660M$ Cash, positive earnings and 11B$ Revenues. Anyway this news is about an Investigation between 2009 and November 2016...that means that it's another old news...well...FTC decided now about the fine to apply but it's not a fine for something that happened now... https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/03/office-depot-computer-scans-gave-fake-results"
@KOKOY.... :) Thomas H. Lee Partners was the OWNER of Compucom and they got 42M Stocks when they sold Compucom to Office Depot 
"This failing stock can afford to alienate the people who watch Fox news? I know I won't buy anything from there again... just like from any company who chooses to enter the political fray. Your job is to provide a product that people want, not affect someone's free speech."
Office Depot has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) ~ Zacks Equity research. Thanks yahoo finance
Holding strong in this market. Dips below 3 I'll add.
"Per yahoo details, Insiders purchased 2.5 million shares and sold 0 shares in the last 6 months. The CEO owns the most of all insiders with 3.2 million, the CFO owns over 1 million. I think bith would prefer their shares to be worth $10 a share rather than $0."
"Are there any serious investors on this site or is it just people pumping the stock? Can someone explain this to me? This year office depot has closed 165 stores. This is a fact, you can go to office depots website yourself and count the stores and you will see I'm right. Let's assume each store did $10 million in revenue a year. 165 stores times $10 million = 1.65 billion in revenue. So how is it possible office depot closes 165 stores, potentially worth $1 billion in annual revenue, yet last quarter they reported $2.5 billion in revenue, near the long term average? Someone please explain to me how you close 165 stores in a year but revenue barely changes."
"Getting more and more excited about ODP. Great balance sheet, improved cash flow, handled the Covid very well. They ar a partner for home and remote offices. I cam see an AMZN takeover without too much antitrust concern given Staples. And it fits AMZN much more than AMC or JCP??? Amazon realizes they need a larger retail presence too battle WMT which is coming for their jugular. Right, DC?"
03/09/20 (MON) - Sooooooo happy to see ODP finally drop under $2 per share. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel after 5 and a half months!!
"Compucom has always been a poor performer. Just ask its employees. As noted there are structural issues with Compucom in particular and untill ODP makes the changes at Compucom that are needed, the stock will not rise above $3."
"Not a good sign the cfo is leaving, but doesn't this kind of thing happen all the time? Maybe AutoNation offered him more money. How do stocks typically trade after news of cfo leaving? I would assume there is a downtrend, but for how long?"
This is the TEAL reason of ODP crash. Compucom is investigated by FBI!!! https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/business/walmart-fbi-investigation.html
Amazon buy odp before alibaba or bidu takeover
Huge layoffs for staples detailed http://framinghamforward.com/news/index.php/2019/09/11/pink-slips-at-staples/
"Market cap is worth more than $814m to a buyer. ODP’s BtoB business is worth more than $1B. That being the case, there’s low risk on the downside with higher upside. Other retailers with last Mike delivery would layer on ODP’s business to their platform. $3 price target..."
Nice move today new highs coming soon
"Just to think about: From Office Depot 8K - ""we expect to receive approximately $80 million when the Timber Notes Receivable and the Non-Recourse debt will be net settled in the next twelve months (1st quarter 2020). In addition, as previously noted in the Income Taxes section discussion, we expect to receive a refund of unutilized AMT credits of $45 million in the first quarter of 2020. - That means 120M$ Cash coming by 1st Quarter 2020."
13 dollars per share coming soon
"Something fishy going on here. Did they not know they'd miss before approving a 100 million buyback? Or did they wait for this to drop to get cheaper? Also, now this is starting to get manipulated by the mm's. This should not have dropped this much based on today's news. Even with the miss, it's still not that bad, and with Alibaba, it does not warrant this type of drop. The rigged system continues."
"ODP will be back on track quickly. The Pre Announcement was only a slight downward revision of ONE division. Rather than damage management credibility, it shows they are on top of things and are willing to hand the market fairly immediate updates visibility Still they indicated $65M adj earnings. When they report, they will maintain year guidance, report strong cash flow and NOW they have the opportunity to employ the pre-announced buyback to boost EPS. This is will be a $4 stock within a few months and this mini crash will be viewed as a GREAT BARGAIN"
"Don't be fooled by artificial price depression. Office Depot has delivered over 39.4% year on year earnings growth in the past 5 years, and share price is $1.86 vs Future cash flow value of $4.63. With almost 95% institutional ownership led by Blackrock, Inc., we will see it rise after earnings."
"In 2015, Staples was willing to buy ODP for $6B+. The government blocked it. Since then, in a mostly good economy and a great environment for stocks, ODP's management has managed to drive the value of the company down to $2.1B and far below that prior to this offer. I'm sure the short term investors will be pleased with the resulting pop in the stock's price from this offer but the longs have mostly been crushed on this stock. Too bad for them and the employees that will lose out in this deal. Meanwhile, management will likely walk away with a large bonus for their ""efforts"". What a shame."
"According to my data, office depot has closed 165 stores this year. And yet it seems investors dont care, the media doesnt care, no one seems to care? That's about 10% of their total stores in less than a year. And yet you want me to believe the company is doing great, making a lot of money? Something is not adding up. Below is my data for the past year, of the total number of office depot stores. I used the public office depot store locator.Office Depot total number of stores by date:8/24/18: 1,3668/18/19: 1,3171/31/20: 1,3175/31/20: 1,2987/24/20: 1,2549/27/20: 1,24210/25/20: 1,24211/4/20: 1,24211/18/20: 1,152"

"The few posting on this board seem to be in complete denial. There is not that much shorting on this stock based on the data available to us. Anyone that is shorting it is not out to make 40k people lose their jobs, they're out to make some $ on their investments like you are doing when you buy long. The company has been authorized for a stock buyback for quite some time and while they don't always publicize when the execute the buyback, it is likely that they have fired that barrel multiple times already.The truth sure seems to be that this company is in multiple businesses where time has passed them by and the leadership has been unable to pivot to a new direction to overcome this. Retail brick and mortar stores are a losing proposition demonstrated by their repeated store comps for the last how many years. Amazon is crushing that part of their business model.The print business is another dying breed. The world has been moving away from printing stuff because it is inefficient and environmentally poor among other reasons. Another business that is going down. Their attempt to provide office space might have had some promise but that business is already grabbed by competitors that have that as their core competency, something Depot doesn't have.Compucom is another disaster as was expected by those paying attention. This move alone has now blown away their major cash reserves and brought on a load of debt to the company that will hasten their downfall.Their alleged bright spot is their BTB business but again, that is likely going to trend poorly fairly quickly as Amazon continues to ramp that up. Even Staples, under new ownership, will likely take market share from these guys.Remember, their dismal performance has occurred during the longest economic expansion in most of our lifetimes. When an inevitable recession comes, that's what will do away with those 40k jobs and this company will likely go away. Yes, they are paying their dividend this time but when you look at their debt and their negative cash flow numbers for the past year- that will end up getting cut at most in two more quarters unless they somehow turn their cash flow around. That seems quite unlikely.Stay invested in this stock and you might get lucky but why would you when there are so many other stocks for strong companies that are depressed with the recent market pullback. You'll likely see them under $1 before you see $2 and $4 for this stock is a pipe dream."
It seems that the Stock Price prssure will continue till the LOW PRICE Takeover...I guess Gerry Smith already made the price agreement...
