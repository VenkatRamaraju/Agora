Anyone else think AIG can get to $60 by year end?
"For those who didn't listen to the 9/9 fireside chat:- Didn't say anything about suspending buyback due to catastrophes, still 2 billion by year end and 6 billion total. Wells Fargo analyst suggested ins. companies may do so. Said liquidity and capital still very strong. He did however, make it sound like the numbers could be fairly sizable for cats, specifically called out German flooding and said not many people are talking about that but instead focusing on IDA.- My interpretation regarding his comments on reinsurance were we can drop the amount we cede if we need/want to. According to their 2020 Annual Report they ceded 11 billion of premium in 2020 and got back 8 billion in reinsurance payments. Perhaps I'm being simplistic but that looks like a 3 billion L to me so my vote is you drop the amount.- Sounded quite confident about the future."

"warrant holder here since original warrant distributions, unfortunately received distributions in a couple different accounts (personal,ira,401k), held long term without really understanding what/why the warrants were distributed since the company was mixed up in the government tarp program at the time. that being said i haven't sold original warrant distributions and have picked up additional warrant positions over the last couple of years trying to dollar-cost average. i've asked my investment house on a couple different occasions about exercising the warrants but after the stock nosedived last january i dug in deeper to dollar-cost average, this is going to be an expensive lesson learned.any purchase at this late stage would appear to be a huge bet the warrant exercise deadline is extended or a particularly risky bet trying to time a few cents upside before selling off or exercising the warrants. one thing i cannot understand is with the pending deadline and new designation of 1/13, 1/15 and 1/19 for trading the warrants and/or exercising the warrants, who would be buying the almost 2.5M AIG/WS @ ~$.10 today?and with the shares trading today around $40.45 nearly $2 below the current $42.2282 warrant exercise price per share, do the numbers make sense to exercise the warrants or just try to sell the warrants before 1/13?current aig price $40.47 divided by 1 share = $40.45 cost per 1 sharecurrent warrant exercise price $42.2282 divided by (no. of shares of aig common stock receivable upon warrant exercise) 1.067 = $39.5766 cost per 1 share$40.45 - $39.5766 = $.8734 profit per share or something like:per 1,000 warrants, $42,228.20 gets 1,067 shares, sold at current $40.45 equals $43,160.15 or $931.95 profit?"
Wow! Chubb added 1 billion in net written premium quarter over quarter!
"In case you are dissatisfied with the way shareholders and warrant holders are treated by AIG, you can contact 2 rating agencies:Institutional shareholders Inc - indicated ""high concern"" in 2019 and worse in 18 and 17Glass Lewis and Co - F grade for pay and performance in 19."

They reduced their limits dramatically so they need to increase the amount of risk they take. There is no excuse for it.
"If you saw me climbing a tree for apples, and you saw the best fruit at arm's length from the ground, would you naturally ask me why I haven't bothered to pick that fruit too? What if my response was that, I'm just too busy climbing this tree, because "" it's hard, but I'm really good at it""?Obviously the proverbial ""low hanging fruit"" are stock buybacks, the higher fruit are the harder and riskier underwriting selection and corporate reorganization. While I'd like to think they can do that too, it frustrates me to think they cannot free up a $billion or two per year to buy back stock at such a steep discount. Seriously? They are going to retire 4% debt, when the dividends alone saved on buybacks would be over 2.6%, and the instant tangible booked profit would be 16+%. That's not even counting the very real value in the other 30+% booked for DTAs and AOCI. Brian may know how to grow apples, but he sure doesn't know how to pick them."
"Aug 12 ""Fireside Chat"" summary. Analyst leading the chat seemed to be pinning part of the low stock price on depressed valuations for Life and Retirement companies. That's not accurate, VOYA is down a similar amount from pre-covid levels as Chubb and has a price that is greater than tangible book. AIG is down significantly more than VOYA and Chubb so it's not that. AIG also trades at a big discount to tangible book. They also discussed ceding and it certainly sounded as thought there will be a reduction in ceding in 21. As said before here they cede at a rate 40% greater than Chubb(28% of premium vs. 20%). That 8% difference is a 2.5 billion hit to premium. Hopefully they can close the gap significantly . Not sure of the economics of the Lloyds transaction but if you include the ceding involved in that transaction it's way above 28%. They are ceding over 1 billion in 3 quarters."

"Baby Steps: I expected AIG to crush earnings, but the beat was only modest. I get the impression that running an insurance operation is like herding cats. Results from positive initiatives are so amorphous and slow. We are deep into Brian's second year and he's still struggling to recover the stock price that Peter left him with. I feel more relieved than grateful with this report."
"Trying to figure out when stock tanked during CC and believe it was when they said net 2020 premium was going to be flat with 19 at 25 billion. AIG ceded 28% of their premiums in 2019 vs 22% in 2018 vs Chubbs 20% in 2019. That 8% difference between them and Chubb is worth 2.7 billion pre-tax, and we know AIG doesn't have to cash pay taxes for a while. The 5% move for them from 18 to 19 was 1.9 billion difference in net premium. Perplexed why/how they can reduce limits and increase deductibles and get huge price increases yoy BUT they still need to increase reinsurance ceded by 5% and do it at a rate 40% worse than Chubb. What kind of policies had they been writing in the past? Perhaps they should tell us occasionally what the Cat Losses would have been had they not reinsured. It's hard to fathom they would need to give up 2.6 billion to what Chubb is doing to protect against CAT losses. Again, what kind of risk were you taking in 2018 when you ceded 1.9 billion less in premium and your deductibles and limits were apparently 50% greater than in 2019. I guess another way to check the CAT loss protection out is to see what AIG's 2019 CAT losses were vs. Chubb's. What do we get for the 2.6 billion. I will check that and get back to you."
About time for company to start buying their stock. What do you say CFO?

"Appear to be adding tremendous liquidity which should speed debt reduction(assuming debt is callable) and more importantly buybacks. Investment book in L & R was sold in July for 6.8 billion minimum(that was value of investments). Affordable housing will be sold in fourth quarter with 4 billion cash being sent to the parent. 2.2 billion dollars from Blackstone L & R 9.9% deal and then another 2 billion potential from the L & R IPO. Was hard to decipher but it appeared they were intimating on the call that the L & R IPO may go above another 9.9% which would mean more than 2 billion. That's almost 15 BILLION of liquidity excluding earnings. I've cited several times about how they are overcapitalized at both P&C and L&R so it makes sense they would sell investments for cash and then put that cash to work in some fashion.The value of P&C is now roughly 21 billion if you assume the Blackstone valuation of L & R at 22 billion is accurate. Where will they put the 15 BILLION to work? Could they do it all, except the 2 billion buyback in 21? That means 13 BILLION and that excludes earnings for the next two quarters with last quarter's earnings at 1.3 BILLION."

"Brian Duperreault, AIG's CEO, said: ""Our financial results for the fourth quarter and for full year 2019 reflect the significant progress we made over the course of 2019 to position AIG for long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. For the full year 2019, after-tax income attributable to common shareholders was $4.1 billion, or $4.59 per diluted share, and Adjusted ROCE was 8.3%. The improvement in our financial performance over the course of last year was broad-based, with contributions from all of our segments, but most notable was the return to underwriting profitability in General Insurance. The full year combined ratio was 99.6% and the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 96.0%. Life & Retirement also delivered solid results in the face of continued headwinds from low interest rates and tightening credit spreads. Finally, we were pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to sell a majority stake in Fortitude Re, our legacy insurance business, which is scheduled to close mid-year, subject to regulatory approvals."" ""As we look to 2020, we will continue to be laser focused on executing on our strategy to position AIG as both a leading insurance franchise and a top-performing company and we remain committed to achieving a 10% Adjusted ROCE by the end of 2021. In addition to continued work as part of the turnaround of General Insurance, AIG 200 will be a top priority. AIG 200 is our multi-year, enterprise-wide transformation program focused on the long-term strategic positioning of AIG and designed to achieve operational excellence. I remain confident we are on the right path at AIG and am very proud of what our colleagues accomplished since I joined the company in 2017. We entered 2020 with great momentum and excitement about what the future holds for AIG,"" Duperreault added."
"Looks like today is the end of the road for us warrant holders. Some ask why they still have any value at all? My guess is two reasons: Small traders often confuse the conversion of $42.23 per 1.067 shares (wrong) for the actual $42.23 per share ($45.07 per 1.067 shares). Larger traders are betting on cashing in, at least to some extent, on the class action lawsuit that is certain to happen. Brian's missteps, by paying too much for acquisitions with little impact, and foregoing all buybacks (hugely profitable) that weren't forced upon him, hurt the shareholders and killed the warrant holders, implicitly his most ardent supporters. This was not about Covid or cat losses. It was about Brian not measuring up operationally, and putting his ego ahead of all the stakeholders. Thank you, Brian!"

The best option for warrant holders is to get the expiration date of the time sensitive securities such as warrants extended by at least 2 years because of Covid...The Fed is keeping the interest rates low until 2023 because of Covid...banks will not pay dividend this year because of Covid...The same should apply to time sensitive securities.
they keep trying to knock down this stock down but with the company buying 400000 shares a day and the upgrades 60 is in site.
"The case for AIG Warrants: Like shares, option prices are determined by the Bid and Ask quotes. However, the forces that affect share prices are different than those affecting option prices. While in the case of shares investors consider all the regular stuff to evaluate the future performance of the stock, option prices are the determined by the share and strike prices. Prior to expiration date, option prices may differ from the “share price minus strike formula” due to differences in expectations regarding share price until expiration, but at expiration they will fall into that formula. The AIG Warrants are options with some added features. Adjusted Exercise Price and Share Receivable upon Exercise. This adjustment, according to the Warrant Agreement, is made only if annual dividends exceed a certain level. This level has been reached in 2015 and adjustment have been made since. The adjustments, which are made quarterly are a function of dividend payout, which is currently $0.32 per quarter. The current Exercise Price is $43.1179 and the Share Receivable upon Exercise stands at 1.045.In order to calculate the Exercise Price in order to get the value of 1 share (rather than 1.045 shares) one should regard the value derived from the “extra” shares (at this point 0.045 multiplied by share price). On June 28, 2019 where closing price was $53.28 this “extra” value was $2.40.One should consider this number as a “rebate” on a purchase, and as such should be deducted from the cost of the purchase which is the exercise price. The new value ($43.1179 - $2.40 = $40.7179) is the “Effective Exercise Price” and should be number to consider in investment considerations of the warrant. Given a share price of $53.28 and an Effective Exercise Price of $40.72 - the warrant should sell for $12.56. Actual price of warrant is $12.25 indicating that warrant is undervalued by $0.31.Warrant value of $12.56 can be computed using the following formula:SP - [(EP) - (SP)*(ES -1)] Where:SP = Share Price (=53.28)EP = Declared Exercise Price (=43.1179)ES = Number of Shares Receivable (=1.045)53.28 -[(43.1179)-(53.28)*(1.045-1)] = 12.56 Assuming that dividend payout remains constant in the next 6 quarters that are left until expiration, one can estimate with a high level of confidence the approximate values of EP and ES and use them to project the warrant value at different share prices at Exercise Time.(Any increases in dividend payout would only raise warrant values)I estimate these values to be:EP = 42.20ES = 1.07Using these estimates, the following would be the value (and price) of the Warrants for alternative share prices at expiration:Share Price $60.00 - Warrant Price $22.00Share Price $64.00 - Warrant Price $26.28Share Price $70.00 - Warrant Price $32.70"
Very disappointing 2nd quarter results. The current management has been promising better results since two years but unable to deliver. Probably time to consider a new top management.
80 by year end
"Listened to call and can't imagine they won't extend the warrant expiration date(if necessary). They are hell bent on reducing debt, even more so now that they are splitting. Assuming our/my understanding of the warrant transaction is correct(meaning warrant holders pay 42.25 for each share). Also, I did a 5 year chart on Yahoo and for the majority of the time it's at 60, never mind 45. They could use Covid as justification for the extension and I'm not sure they need justification. Unfortunately and as usual the topic was not discussed."

Hard to read insurance earnings in general but this one is doubly hard to understand. Having said that it appears they are making progress. They earned 600 million and that's with a 650 million hit to net premium from their Lloyd's move and a 600 million or so hit from Covid. The ratio was under 95% for the first time in some time(if I'm reading it correctly). Since the Hedge Fund stuff is on a quarter lag assume it will reverse next quarter which should help adjusted tangible book. It seems to be quite a bit more positive than the more recent quarterly reports.
"@John Still no buyback news. I'm betting the farm on a February CC that isn't a train wreck for a change. Other than the 4th quarter hurricane, which has been quantified, the rest has been pretty friendly. Brian projects an air of confidence that implies we should start seeing results in the ROE and positive book value changes sooner, rather than later. If I'm wrong all I have to say is, ""Welcome to Walmart. Welcome to Walmart. Welcome to Walmart......"""
"Regarding warrants, AIG can change the terms of the warrants. They may not do it as part of their game plan!!!WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of the Warrant Agreement, the Company and the Holder have the power to amend and modify the terms of the Warrant Agreement."
no one on this stock. no rara about 6b buyback no rara about the coming split or capital infusion. when it happens we go to book value. in the mean time they are eating up their tax losses and turning them into cash. at least 50% return by 1/1/23
This ride is a lot longer than what I thought it would be when I bought a large amount of AIG stock prior to the reverse 1-20 split but I'm encouraged that I could actually turn a profit in another 12-24 months.

"Warrants and the spinoff:I may not get a chance to post this before earnings make it irrelevant, but regarding the life/retirement spinoff and the prospects for the warrants:I see three things that can happen- one bad, one great, and the other still pretty good.1. The stock stays in the toilet until the warrants expire worthless. The spinoff makes this even more problematic. If the stock recovers within a year of the warrant expiration, after the spinoff, that only adds further grounds for a class action. Furthermore, it is a mark against Brian’s legacy as a corporate miracle maker. Sad to say, he clearly cares more about his reputation than AIG’s stakeholders. The good news is that he’s probably determined not to let this happen, albeit for selfish reasons. 2. The best case scenario is that AIG crushes earnings. Between that and the spinoff news the stock surges before the warrants expire. The warrant holders are made whole. Everybody is happy. Brian can have his bragging rights. Good riddance.3. Perhaps most likely is neither of the above. The warrant holders, largely to prevent the chaos caused by scenario #1, have to be included in the benefits of the spinoff. This would involve both extending the expiration, as well as prorating the warrants fractionally for each of the two resulting companies (say 1/3 life/retirement, 2/3 P&C). As messy as that might be, it’s the only scenario that buys Brian more time (as if 3 & 1/2 years isn’t enough). Call me cynical, but my experience is that a soap opera like this seems to find a way to avoid resolution, extending itself through time. This is better than nothing."
"AIG appears moderately healthier than expected. But the analysts focused on the L&R separation, a L&R IPO and capitalization/debt. For us warrant holders that is all largely irrelevant. Two takeaways from the CC. stuck with me: They mentioned ""other stakeholders"" a few times. That was encouraging. But then Peter (I think?) snuck a comment in about ""no scheduled events changing"". I see no other way to interpret that except warrant holders will sink or swim by the current January expiration. It appears that some ""stakeholders"" matter more than others. Unless my previous #2 scenario of a surge materializes, the warrant holders are screwed. We are not included in the benefits of the L&R split and might have to lawyer up. Thank you very much Brian, Destroyer of Wealth."
"American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) is one of the stocks Mario Gabelli is dumping."
"The CC was surprisingly strong. The bottom line was ugly, no doubt. But they were surprisingly detailed and confident that they could achieve profitable underwriting and 8% ROE for 2019. I don't expect huge upside, but I do think our losses will moderate after the analysts have had time to weigh in. The buyback program was not as neglected as I thought either They might pick up another 40-50M shares during the year as well."
"It is my impression, based on very limited research, that AIG faces little liability for ""business disruption"". That typically is covered only when the business or supply chains undergo physical damage. Pandemics and government mandated shutdowns are usually excluded, unless they are specifically not. That seems like it would never be addressed in domestic policies, but it is common internationally and those seasoned provisions are usually included here as well. The stimulus package also covers much of the business disruption issues already. Stock repurchases are only frozen for companies seeking bailout loans. That shouldn't include AIG. (God help us if it does. The last thing AIG wants is that bailout label again.) That means AIG has the authority to continue buying stock. Let's hope they have the ability and sense to do so. We are still selling at well below half of tangible book."
