"I believe this is the beginning of the recovery for AIG stock. prior to covid 19, it was trading in around the 50 to 60s range for past few years. with rates expected to rise, covid liability scare behind us, selling off of the life insurance unit and higher premiums, AIG'S stock looks to be in a good position to create value for its stockholders. good indication of the covid liability being not as bad as they imagined is AIG paying back the debt they borrowed because of Covid early in 2021"

"AIG appears moderately healthier than expected. But the analysts focused on the L&R separation, a L&R IPO and capitalization/debt. For us warrant holders that is all largely irrelevant. Two takeaways from the CC. stuck with me: They mentioned ""other stakeholders"" a few times. That was encouraging. But then Peter (I think?) snuck a comment in about ""no scheduled events changing"". I see no other way to interpret that except warrant holders will sink or swim by the current January expiration. It appears that some ""stakeholders"" matter more than others. Unless my previous #2 scenario of a surge materializes, the warrant holders are screwed. We are not included in the benefits of the L&R split and might have to lawyer up. Thank you very much Brian, Destroyer of Wealth."

Is PEG of 0.22 growth real ? It seems to regain momentum upward. Is it the acquisition digested?
AIG manipulation for its stock in targeting of wiping its warrant completely is so obvious. One thing is not obvious to me is that why those AIG investors considering convert their AIG warrant to AIG share do not buy shares at current better price and take the money loss in warrant in tax savings?

"Fri, December 11, 2020, 2:16 PM MSTAmerican International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today announced that in accordance with the terms of the outstanding warrants expiring January 19, 2021 (CUSIP number 026874156) (the ""Warrants"") to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, the Warrant exercise price will be reduced to $42.2282 per share from $42.4151 per share and the number of shares of AIG Common Stock receivable upon Warrant exercise will increase to 1.067 from 1.062. Each of these adjustments will be effective at the close of business on December 14, 2020. Any Warrant exercised on or prior to December 14, 2020 will not be entitled to these adjustments.These adjustments resulted from the declaration by the Board of Directors of AIG on November 5, 2020 of a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock. The dividend is payable on December 28, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2020."
The following article is worthwhile to read for warrant holders. Especially for long-term holders: Note items 2) and 3) under Key Risks session. We still have some hope provided AIG management team is going to do the right thing for its loyal group of investors and company's long term financial benefit. Please note that the author seems screwed up current warrant strike price and still using $45/share figure (may be the author is right about it when doing a comparison with a counterpart option and/or for the promotion of the option).https://seekingalpha.com/article/4391773-american-international-group-inc-warrants-overvalued-vs-call-options

Now my question is if we have to buy AIG stock for exercising it for each warrant then why don’t we buy the stock instead of warrant?!! I can’t use my invested amount for the warrants for AIG stock. Still I’m not getting it?!!!
"Merry Christmas to all investors, I hope God will save us from characterless people immediately after this weekend."
"It is my impression, based on very limited research, that AIG faces little liability for ""business disruption"". That typically is covered only when the business or supply chains undergo physical damage. Pandemics and government mandated shutdowns are usually excluded, unless they are specifically not. That seems like it would never be addressed in domestic policies, but it is common internationally and those seasoned provisions are usually included here as well. The stimulus package also covers much of the business disruption issues already. Stock repurchases are only frozen for companies seeking bailout loans. That shouldn't include AIG. (God help us if it does. The last thing AIG wants is that bailout label again.) That means AIG has the authority to continue buying stock. Let's hope they have the ability and sense to do so. We are still selling at well below half of tangible book."
"Thoughts on announcing the February 21 1.5 billion bond retirement this early and this publicly? They retired around 1.5 billion between August 2020 and then the fourth quarter for roughly 700 million each time without a press release, at least not one that I saw. Are they trying to signal something?Hopefully they don't keep the debt reduction diatribe going in the February call because as I've said before they should be looking at net debt, not gross debt. They said they were overcapitalized last quarter and they should emphasize that if it remains the case this quarter. That means they could take down more debt if there was debt to be called. You can't hold stock buybacks hostage to debt reduction when the only reason you can't reduce the debt is that none of it's callable. I also have a suggestion on the warrants, if there are truly ""only"" 10 million warrants left how about a tender offer for $10 per warrant and if the holder accepts they give up their right to sue."
"Not to be redundant but after Traveler's number just don't see how they don't blow through the now $1.05 number.

Don't want to get hopes up too much but has to be a big beat."
If they don’t repurchase now at least 15% of outstanding shares- they have no business running this company any longer.

"As a warrant holder, I am now in the perverse position of wanting the stock to slump for the next 8 days. My nightmare is to have the shares rise by only pennies above the $42.23 strike, then making the nail biting decision if and when to sell. Or worse yet, to see the stock surge between the 13th and 19th, and being helpless to monetize it. I'm not sure my brokers could or would honor a last minute cashless conversion. Anybody know how that might work? It's probably academic at this point, but I'm still curious."

"If you saw me climbing a tree for apples, and you saw the best fruit at arm's length from the ground, would you naturally ask me why I haven't bothered to pick that fruit too? What if my response was that, I'm just too busy climbing this tree, because "" it's hard, but I'm really good at it""?Obviously the proverbial ""low hanging fruit"" are stock buybacks, the higher fruit are the harder and riskier underwriting selection and corporate reorganization. While I'd like to think they can do that too, it frustrates me to think they cannot free up a $billion or two per year to buy back stock at such a steep discount. Seriously? They are going to retire 4% debt, when the dividends alone saved on buybacks would be over 2.6%, and the instant tangible booked profit would be 16+%. That's not even counting the very real value in the other 30+% booked for DTAs and AOCI. Brian may know how to grow apples, but he sure doesn't know how to pick them."

Any insurance experts out there-AIG ceded 40% of their first quarter premiums while Chubb appears to have ceded less than 20%. Why the disparity? AIG ceded roughly 33% in last year's first quarter. It appears the first quarter is the high water mark on ceding premium. I did look up ceding and it is related to reinsurance. I understand reinsurance just not why AIG needs to do it at so much a greater rate.
Net written premium is almost $650 million above earned premium for the June quarter. This quarter's earned premium was fairly close to last quarter's net written premium so hopefully that means next quarter's earned premium is up $650 million from this quarter where earnings were $1.3 billion or so. They shouldn't have to cash pay taxes for a little while yet AND they are BUYING BACK 2 BILLION OF STOCK prior to year end and then another 4 billion minimum next year. You could be looking at $9.00 in earnings next year if the company stayed combined. I think Yahoo is at $5 or so. How we are only up $1.00 after hours is mind boggling.

"I'm having trouble figuring the implications of TRV's earnings for AIG. They lost $.16/shr, but were expected to lose $.20. Revenues were slightly down also, but less than expected. And the stock is up. How can AIG be expected to make $.51 under similar conditions? TRV said covid had only modest impact, but that storms (!?), low investment returns and riots (!?) did. I don't remember a lot of unusual spring storms. AIG also said earlier that riots affected small businesses more, which they tend not to cover. Any guesses how this tweaks AIG's expectations?"

It's simple when you are smart. Unfortunately it's not the case with the AIG management.1) Declare that warrants will never expire.2) Buy back shares at the depressed price.3) Make cash when the warrants will be exercised.
"Aug 12 ""Fireside Chat"" summary. Analyst leading the chat seemed to be pinning part of the low stock price on depressed valuations for Life and Retirement companies. That's not accurate, VOYA is down a similar amount from pre-covid levels as Chubb and has a price that is greater than tangible book. AIG is down significantly more than VOYA and Chubb so it's not that. AIG also trades at a big discount to tangible book. They also discussed ceding and it certainly sounded as thought there will be a reduction in ceding in 21. As said before here they cede at a rate 40% greater than Chubb(28% of premium vs. 20%). That 8% difference is a 2.5 billion hit to premium. Hopefully they can close the gap significantly . Not sure of the economics of the Lloyds transaction but if you include the ceding involved in that transaction it's way above 28%. They are ceding over 1 billion in 3 quarters."
Hi Kaptain I am so on board for you to find a legal firm that will fight our case as warrant holders especially seeing that I was Receipient of warrants at the outset
It would be good if the company issued a statement indicating that the CEO and CFO were not understood during the last meeting. The statement needs to refer to what Brian agreed to 3 years ago. It should emphasize that the objectives have not changed. Progress has been made and the Profit and Revenue picture will greatly improve in the next 12 months. In addition AIG will buy aggressively shares and warrants until the current market situation gets back to normal.

"Brian Duperreault's mission was to clean up AIG, to repackage it for sale."
"The case for AIG Warrants: Like shares, option prices are determined by the Bid and Ask quotes. However, the forces that affect share prices are different than those affecting option prices. While in the case of shares investors consider all the regular stuff to evaluate the future performance of the stock, option prices are the determined by the share and strike prices. Prior to expiration date, option prices may differ from the “share price minus strike formula” due to differences in expectations regarding share price until expiration, but at expiration they will fall into that formula. The AIG Warrants are options with some added features. Adjusted Exercise Price and Share Receivable upon Exercise. This adjustment, according to the Warrant Agreement, is made only if annual dividends exceed a certain level. This level has been reached in 2015 and adjustment have been made since. The adjustments, which are made quarterly are a function of dividend payout, which is currently $0.32 per quarter. The current Exercise Price is $43.1179 and the Share Receivable upon Exercise stands at 1.045.In order to calculate the Exercise Price in order to get the value of 1 share (rather than 1.045 shares) one should regard the value derived from the “extra” shares (at this point 0.045 multiplied by share price). On June 28, 2019 where closing price was $53.28 this “extra” value was $2.40.One should consider this number as a “rebate” on a purchase, and as such should be deducted from the cost of the purchase which is the exercise price. The new value ($43.1179 - $2.40 = $40.7179) is the “Effective Exercise Price” and should be number to consider in investment considerations of the warrant. Given a share price of $53.28 and an Effective Exercise Price of $40.72 - the warrant should sell for $12.56. Actual price of warrant is $12.25 indicating that warrant is undervalued by $0.31.Warrant value of $12.56 can be computed using the following formula:SP - [(EP) - (SP)*(ES -1)] Where:SP = Share Price (=53.28)EP = Declared Exercise Price (=43.1179)ES = Number of Shares Receivable (=1.045)53.28 -[(43.1179)-(53.28)*(1.045-1)] = 12.56 Assuming that dividend payout remains constant in the next 6 quarters that are left until expiration, one can estimate with a high level of confidence the approximate values of EP and ES and use them to project the warrant value at different share prices at Exercise Time.(Any increases in dividend payout would only raise warrant values)I estimate these values to be:EP = 42.20ES = 1.07Using these estimates, the following would be the value (and price) of the Warrants for alternative share prices at expiration:Share Price $60.00 - Warrant Price $22.00Share Price $64.00 - Warrant Price $26.28Share Price $70.00 - Warrant Price $32.70"

"Change of opinion on warrants. Not egotistical enough to believe people care what I think but at least a few of us have exchanged thoughts so wanted to let those people know that I have changed my opinion on AIG extending the the warrant expiration date. Kaptain's post the other day about IR telling him specifically they were not going to extend and then IR's response to me months ago about how they report the diluted shares got me to do some more digging. IR told me they only include the warrants in the diluted share count when they are above the exercise price. You can look at their quarterly earnings supplement releases and in the first couple of pages they list the fully diluted share count numbers for the most recent 4 quarters. Without share repurchase you can see the diluted share count reduce from Q4 2019 when the share price was above the exercise price to Q1 20 when it's now below the exercise price. The reduction is less than 10 million shares. The complicating factor is I believe they use average weighted shares so I'm not sure how that figures in to the calculation. The same thing happens in 2018 when in December of 18 the share price dipped below the exercise price and again you see a reduction in the diluted share count WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF A SHARE REPURCHASE. My post yesterday, specifically the part about how the share price was close to 60 for the last five years actually bolsters managements point that they should NOT extend rather than they should. They can make the case original warrant holders had ample opportunity to exercise when price was at 60 and exercise price was 45 or less. This goes to the legal argument being made by some, including me. Since there are now less than 10 million warrants outstanding( IMO on the number) their legal jeopardy is much less than I thought and perhaps more importantly their ability to generate capital is also much less than thought. Perhaps Covid will get them to extend a bit, perhaps past earnings but I don't believe they have the capital raising incentive I previously thought."
Will this stock ever really bust out? I've had this now since 9/2008 and still in the red. It would not be a huge loss for me but I feel like this stock is at a stand still. JMO. Thoughts.

"For those who didn't listen to the 9/9 fireside chat:- Didn't say anything about suspending buyback due to catastrophes, still 2 billion by year end and 6 billion total. Wells Fargo analyst suggested ins. companies may do so. Said liquidity and capital still very strong. He did however, make it sound like the numbers could be fairly sizable for cats, specifically called out German flooding and said not many people are talking about that but instead focusing on IDA.- My interpretation regarding his comments on reinsurance were we can drop the amount we cede if we need/want to. According to their 2020 Annual Report they ceded 11 billion of premium in 2020 and got back 8 billion in reinsurance payments. Perhaps I'm being simplistic but that looks like a 3 billion L to me so my vote is you drop the amount.- Sounded quite confident about the future."
"This is Great News for AIG...American International Group, Inc.

As a result of this review, executive management recommended, and the Board has decided to pursue, a separation of the Life & Retirement business from AIG.AIG’s executive management and Board believe a simplified corporate structure will unlock significant value for shareholders and other stakeholders. Although no decisions have been made as to how to achieve a full separation, the Board’s intent is to accomplish it in a way that maximizes shareholder value and establishes two independent, market leading companies."

"Am I missing something? If you divide the warrant strike price by number of shares converted, you get an effective per share conversion of $41.57. This is the number I currently use to calculate my ""in the money"" portion of my warrants. The remainder is the premium for the time value of the option. At today's close, the time premium for the next 18+ months is $0.45. Forty five cents to leverage $45 worth of stock for 18 months. But wait!, There's more! The strike reduction, not counting the share conversion adjustment, is approximately 64 cents annually- close to 5%. Unless I'm mistaken, you are getting paid to hold the warrants. In other words, if AIG only earned their dividend, and the price of the stock did not change, you'd be making 2+% on the common, but 5% just by holding the warrants. That 5% would be booked as a reduction in the strike price, and an increase in the ""in the money"" portion of the warrant. Even Warren Buffett has criticized long-term option pricing. This makes no sense to me."

"Baby Steps. You would think AIG had a blowout quarter the way they were crowing about ""progress"" during the CC.

"Warrants and the spinoff:I may not get a chance to post this before earnings make it irrelevant, but regarding the life/retirement spinoff and the prospects for the warrants:I see three things that can happen- one bad, one great, and the other still pretty good.1. The stock stays in the toilet until the warrants expire worthless. The spinoff makes this even more problematic. If the stock recovers within a year of the warrant expiration, after the spinoff, that only adds further grounds for a class action. Furthermore, it is a mark against Brian’s legacy as a corporate miracle maker. Sad to say, he clearly cares more about his reputation than AIG’s stakeholders. The good news is that he’s probably determined not to let this happen, albeit for selfish reasons. 2. The best case scenario is that AIG crushes earnings. Between that and the spinoff news the stock surges before the warrants expire. The warrant holders are made whole. Everybody is happy. Brian can have his bragging rights. Good riddance.3. Perhaps most likely is neither of the above. The warrant holders, largely to prevent the chaos caused by scenario #1, have to be included in the benefits of the spinoff. This would involve both extending the expiration, as well as prorating the warrants fractionally for each of the two resulting companies (say 1/3 life/retirement, 2/3 P&C). As messy as that might be, it’s the only scenario that buys Brian more time (as if 3 & 1/2 years isn’t enough). Call me cynical, but my experience is that a soap opera like this seems to find a way to avoid resolution, extending itself through time. This is better than nothing."
Very disappointing 2nd quarter results. The current management has been promising better results since two years but unable to deliver. Probably time to consider a new top management.
"Time to shop warrant class action attorneys? The board's actions to overrule Brian appear too little, too late. There's a couple $Billion at stake, with the warrant holders ""holding the bag"" for Brian's miscues and the boards reluctance to step in. Names and email addresses for likely candidates to be granted class status?"
Anyone listen to today's call? Sounds like there is concern about opioid litigation impact but don't want that to be the takeaway. Said on AIG 200 they weren't necessarily looking to reduce expenses. Don't understand how they reduce the expense ratio by 5% if they don't do that. I guess with a 3 year timeline to get to the 5% they could keep expenses flat while revenue increases but don't see how that gets you down 5%. Reiterated prior comments that pricing remains strong.

"Looks like today is the end of the road for us warrant holders. Some ask why they still have any value at all? My guess is two reasons: Small traders often confuse the conversion of $42.23 per 1.067 shares (wrong) for the actual $42.23 per share ($45.07 per 1.067 shares). Larger traders are betting on cashing in, at least to some extent, on the class action lawsuit that is certain to happen. Brian's missteps, by paying too much for acquisitions with little impact, and foregoing all buybacks (hugely profitable) that weren't forced upon him, hurt the shareholders and killed the warrant holders, implicitly his most ardent supporters. This was not about Covid or cat losses. It was about Brian not measuring up operationally, and putting his ego ahead of all the stakeholders. Thank you, Brian!"
Continuing to transform themsleves into a PC insurer with a focus on improved pricing. trading at a big discount to book relative to other PC insurers. This looks liek a great LT buy with a good dividend yield in the interim.
Travelers said 2019 pricing non-auto should increase greater than the 18 rate of increase which will be good news for AIG. They also said they slowed the pace of buybacks in the quarter due to the potential outlay for the California fires. Perhaps AIG did the same which could explain the lack of a new buyback announcement.
just keep selling your shares back to the company after the funds the supply is going to get miniscule. we are going into the sixties within 2 months.
While I'm not happy they are not buying back stock that seemed like an extremely bullish conference call. Hope that's right.
"Donald J. Trump, US President, said he's read some loss of business insurance policies and they don't contain the word Pandemic, therefore saying they could/should be liable. The flip side of that is, my opinion, if it does contain the word Pandemic they shouldn't be liable. I realize he's not the final arbiter of this but it seems more and more judicial decisions, not just by juries but also those by judges, are impacted by social media therefore his words could be important from that perspective. Since AIG sells a separate Pandemic loss of business policy I'm hopeful their base policy contains language that Pandemics are excluded."

Only mentioned share price as it related to currency used for an acquisition. Nonetheless, lets hope they use the entire 1.5 billion left on the buy back prior to quarter end."
"I just read that they are redeeming 350 million worth of 4.35% notes that mature in 2045.Am I the only one who thinks this is insanity. Why would they call those notes? It's just 4.35%.

"Trying to figure out when stock tanked during CC and believe it was when they said net 2020 premium was going to be flat with 19 at 25 billion. AIG ceded 28% of their premiums in 2019 vs 22% in 2018 vs Chubbs 20% in 2019. That 8% difference between them and Chubb is worth 2.7 billion pre-tax, and we know AIG doesn't have to cash pay taxes for a while. The 5% move for them from 18 to 19 was 1.9 billion difference in net premium. Perplexed why/how they can reduce limits and increase deductibles and get huge price increases yoy BUT they still need to increase reinsurance ceded by 5% and do it at a rate 40% worse than Chubb. What kind of policies had they been writing in the past? Perhaps they should tell us occasionally what the Cat Losses would have been had they not reinsured. It's hard to fathom they would need to give up 2.6 billion to what Chubb is doing to protect against CAT losses. Again, what kind of risk were you taking in 2018 when you ceded 1.9 billion less in premium and your deductibles and limits were apparently 50% greater than in 2019. I guess another way to check the CAT loss protection out is to see what AIG's 2019 CAT losses were vs. Chubb's. What do we get for the 2.6 billion. I will check that and get back to you."
"Listened to call and can't imagine they won't extend the warrant expiration date(if necessary). They are hell bent on reducing debt, even more so now that they are splitting. Assuming our/my understanding of the warrant transaction is correct(meaning warrant holders pay 42.25 for each share). Also, I did a 5 year chart on Yahoo and for the majority of the time it's at 60, never mind 45. They could use Covid as justification for the extension and I'm not sure they need justification. Unfortunately and as usual the topic was not discussed."

"Just noticed that AIG filed a SEC 8-K Material Event ending Monday, November 23, 2020. AIG Warrant was mentioned at this form. See the link below: https://last10k.com/sec-filings/aig/0001104659-20-128476.htm?utm_source=stocktwits&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=8K&utm_term=aigI am wondering is there any significance (or clue) we, the suffered long-term Warrant holders, can draw from this."
"Chubb had a bang-up quarter with premiums written up almost 10%. The 1.00 estimate for the AIG quarter hasn't budged for quite some time so hopefully it's a positive.

Last point is according to Yahoo Finance institutional ownership is now above 94%, the highest I can remember."

"AIG is going to participate in a virtual UBS conference on the 15th re: Specialty and Re-Insurance. Is it me? Or does this seem like an after-the-fact attempt to justify the Glatfelter and Validus acquisitions? They paid fair market rates for those companies, which didn't even cover the revenue lost cleaning up AIG's P&C book. They could have preserved more revenue per share by buying back stock, in my opinion, and saved cash by retiring dividend obligation. But Brian's dreams of rebuilding an empire took center stage over shareholders' interests. Recent attempts to address the share plunge appear, again, too little, too late."
"Confusing as usual. I was going to write what rules the day as if earnings were poor but they did beat estimates. I was going to say that,or the 93.9 loss ratio which is the lowest I can remember. You start getting into the low 90s, high 80s on ratio and you start making a lot of money and they are almost there. It's so hard to tell what's going on with revenue because of the personal line move they made and the fact that travel insurance is way down. On the capital side, we are through the hurricane season and it seems the worst of Covid is over, from an insurance perspective anyway, so hopefully the will put some of the 10.7 billion of cash to work on a buyback. Probably wasting my breath on that as usual but it's hard for them to justify not doing it at this point, at this price. They paid 650 of debt already so there is 2.4 billion to get back to where they were plus the 1.2 billion of back taxes. They have to assume there is going to be some cash flow next quarter plus the personal lines move supposedly freed up 500 million of capital. Again, they have the resources to do a buyback."
Would assume they will announce additional buyback soon since only $700 million was remaining and they used $500 million in November alone. Can't imagine they would want to be without bullets with stock price this low. He reiterated at 12/5 conference that their capital allocation focus will be on buybacks with stock this low.
"Why is Dupperal still at the helm of AIG...........He did NOTHING to deseverve all those Millions the past years. That money should be Confiscated, and BOD arrested!"
"@John Still no buyback news. I'm betting the farm on a February CC that isn't a train wreck for a change. Other than the 4th quarter hurricane, which has been quantified, the rest has been pretty friendly. Brian projects an air of confidence that implies we should start seeing results in the ROE and positive book value changes sooner, rather than later. If I'm wrong all I have to say is, ""Welcome to Walmart. Welcome to Walmart. Welcome to Walmart......"""
"I'm wondering what lawyers are lining up for class action on the warrants. My questions are: 1: How much should they ask for, including their 30% cut? 2. How will that money be distributed, based on when and at what price the warrants were bought and sold for, or expired? That's the messy question. About 45% of my warrants I've owned almost from day 1. The other 55% I bought on the February plunge, believing in Brian's cocky deceptions. Does somebody who bought in June and sold in December deserve compensation? Thoughts, anybody? Finally, 3. How long can we reasonably expect the legal process to last and the checks to be distributed? What a mess. Thank you, Brian."
"This AIG management team has the legitimate cause to extend the warrant expiration date for this Covid-19 pandemic and all the power to do it, but they just choose not doing it until now. What is this: Screw their investors?!"
"Baby Steps: I expected AIG to crush earnings, but the beat was only modest. I get the impression that running an insurance operation is like herding cats. Results from positive initiatives are so amorphous and slow. We are deep into Brian's second year and he's still struggling to recover the stock price that Peter left him with. I feel more relieved than grateful with this report."
"Looked at last year's press releases regarding when earnings were to be released - meaning the release about the release - and they were done well ahead of the actual release date of earnings. That means to me we will see some sort of interim release of financial data not just a release telling us of the release. It would seem, therefore, we should be pretty close to hearing something since we are only a couple of weeks from a normal earnings release."
The best option for warrant holders is to get the expiration date of the time sensitive securities such as warrants extended by at least 2 years because of Covid...The Fed is keeping the interest rates low until 2023 because of Covid...banks will not pay dividend this year because of Covid...The same should apply to time sensitive securities.
"Listened to call and not sure what issue is that caused the drop. Guided loss ratio to 94 at the midpoint which I believe equates when compared to 96 this year should generate an additional 500 million in pretax profit, not a small number considering they did around 4 billion in 19. Assuming my math is correct with 2% on 25 billion in premium. On a separate note their prior book of business must have been horrendous, I guess. They have reduced limits and increased deductible tremendously, or so they say, and their getting double digit rate increased yet their net written premium is dropping by 10%. The fearless leader has said they weren't getting paid for the risk they were taking. Their doing all this risk limiting and getting rate increases one would assume it would have a bigger bottom line impact than 2%."
AIG needs to Lower Costs at least $1B annually so start with Dupperal Salary!
"While earnings may not have been great there does need to be a re-rating of the company IMO because there is the penalty box and there is where they have been sent. Chubb is 10 or 15% from it's all time high and VOYA on the L&R side is down ""only"" 20% from it's pre-covid high while AIG is down close to 40%."
"Will the era of massive shareholder wealth destruction finally be over for AIG when they report 4Q earnings? Prior 2 quarters they've beat consensus EPS by 16 cents and 27 cents, respectively. Last year they earned $1.03 per share during 4Q, and consensus EPS for 4Q 2020 is 93 cents. Let's hope they continue the recent favorable earnings surprises and beat 4Q 2020 by at least 27 cents. If they do, and finally increase their dividend after being flat for several years, and also don't have any more significant write downs, this stock should pop as it has an extremely low price to book ratio, low forward PE, and good dividend yield. This might be worth a gamble by buying some call options."
Mark Lyons and Brian Duperreault wish you a Very Merry Christmas from Bermuda.
"First ""shareholder"" friendly call in about 3 years. Actually gave some hard numbers that let us know when they will be done with debt reduction. Based on my calculation, they need another 1.7billion after the 1.5 billion paid on Feb 1. They had 10.5 billion of liquidity at 12/31 which goes down to 9 billion after 1.5 payment. If they get to a 1 billion profit in Q 1 subtracting the 1.7 billion gives them 8.3 billion to buy back stock. They didn't discuss the tax payment so not sure they made that, if not, it's another 1.4 billion. Bottom line they are at the point where they can buyback stock, even using their shareholder unfriendly methodology. I'm not even taking into account they are also capitalized at a level above their target.Big question is what is the life/retirement division worth? Voya has a 6 or 7 billion market cap and it earns 400-500 million. AIG life/retirement earned pre-tax about 1 billion a quarter for the last 3 quarters. So lets say 3 billion NI per year, using VOYA as a guide you can get to 36 billion. All of AIG has a market cap of 37 billion as of today. If they IPO or sell 20% you get near 7 billion, with which they said they may buy back stock."
Thanks to (http://trademarketview.tech) I have saved hours of research for stock picks. Their daily watchlists help me make the most of my trades each day!
The warrants should not have an expiration date!
Best conference call regarding forward looking info in years. I listened to first 15 minutes or so live yesterday. read it all this morning. 1. Expected revenue growth in GI next year2. Finally lessening the amount of ceded premium so you have revenue growth plus more going to bottom line with less ceding 3. Expenses going down4. If you believe it's a good thing the split into GI & L&RThe reason the stock is where it's at is they've did such a poor job of explaining what was going on. The 2 biggest mistakes were not letting analysts know about the lack of revenue growth in 20 prior to February call and also not letting the analysts know how much they were going to continue to cede. Everyone thought with all the bragging they were doing about reducing limits and increasing deductibles they would cede less but then they dropped that bomb in February along with the no revenue growth bomb.
Buybacks can go now a long way. $10B could buy back 25% of outstanding shares and raise SP by $10. A must in order to rebuild the stock’s credibility in the capital market.
"Regarding warrants, AIG can change the terms of the warrants. They may not do it as part of their game plan!!!WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of the Warrant Agreement, the Company and the Holder have the power to amend and modify the terms of the Warrant Agreement."
Is there no hungry lawyer out there to see the value in a class action on behalf of the warrant holders
"Should get last quarter's $700 million investment underperformance back this quarter, correct? Hopefully there's not catastrophic charges we are not aware of. CFO seemed to be guaranteeing mid 90's on loss ratio so hopefully last quarter's kitchen sinking is the end of the surprises. 1.06 seems more than doable, don't know how they will report the investment income loss reversal."
Hard to read insurance earnings in general but this one is doubly hard to understand. Having said that it appears they are making progress. They earned 600 million and that's with a 650 million hit to net premium from their Lloyd's move and a 600 million or so hit from Covid. The ratio was under 95% for the first time in some time(if I'm reading it correctly). Since the Hedge Fund stuff is on a quarter lag assume it will reverse next quarter which should help adjusted tangible book. It seems to be quite a bit more positive than the more recent quarterly reports.
"A message to AIG management - as they say in football you are what your record says you are. In stocks, after 3 years, you are what your stock price says you are. You boys need to stop patting yourselves on the back during conference calls about the wonderful job you are doing. You bought companies that produce 5 billion in premium when your net premiums were 26 billion. You claim pricing is up double digits when your net premiums were 26 billion. So that's 8 billion in additional premium by my count yet your net premium for 2020 is going to be down 1 billion from the 25 billion. As our CEO says we want the book to be rock solid and then we will grow. Well big fella I could run the company and take out 9 billion of premium and have the book be ""rock solid"". As I've said before perhaps you should have forewarned shareholders and analysts of this plan and then we shareholders wouldn't be bewildered for the third or fourth time during your tenure. The one analyst on the call seemed to be stunned that you were only projecting 25 billion of net premium in 2020 after the CEO bragged for 2 minutes about all of your double digit price increases. Apparently that one analyst, at a minimum, wasn't IN on the plan. Again the CEO told us you weren't getting paid for your high limits and low deductibles but apparently you must have been getting paid something because we lost 9 BILLION IN PREMIUM somewhere along the way."
Anyone else think AIG can get to $60 by year end?
"CFO had multiple gems on the call, a couple of which already were discussed, but one not discussed yet is that the portfolio is so radically different from past years they may put the breaks on the loss ratio reduction. Similar to his treating us like infants with the debt ratio this is a second example of this treatment. If by radically different you mean the limits have decreased dramatically and the deductibles are up dramatically as is the ceded premium(compared to 18 not 19) ok. Why those factors , however, would cause you to slow walk your ratio is beyond me, they are all items that should cause you to expedite the normalization. They really seemed to go out of their way to damage the stock price. All of this stuff could have been laid out prior, like when Zaffino spoke in December, he had to know this was the plan then. At a minimum he had to know what they were doing from a ceding perspective since most of that work is done in January. This decline was an unforced error by management."
"WarrantsThanks for your note; we’ve been receiving many of these and I do expect that there will be a question at the meeting. At the current time:We recognize that the warrants are currently under water.We hope that our share price will improve prior to the expiration of the warrants next January.While the exercise price of the warrants and the number of shares receivable upon warrant exercise are subject to anti-dilution adjustments for certain events, the terms of the warrants do not contemplate an adjustment or an extension of the expiration date to account for AIG’s current stock price.We do not expect to alter any of the terms of the warrants. I would note that equity and warrant holders, as well as stock option holders, are subject to the risk of market volatility, which has clearly happened with COVID-19, as our stock price was $55 in early February. Other capital investors (debt/hybrids) also don’t have the right to reprice debt coupons previously issued by AIG. Hopefully the markets will recover, particularly for insurance companies, as the economy comes out of its global doldrums."
"Anybody read the article on mortgage backed securities either today or yesterday? Now we know a little more as to why were down 60% from our recent high which isn't really all that high. Leveraged funds are liquidating due the drop in value, as much as 40%. AIG has a ton of those and add that to their energy bond investments and the fact that they are getting sued by their customers for not covering the Pandemic business loss and it explains a lot. Seems like things are starting to turn on the Pandemic a bit, California and Washington State are peaking according to Dr. Birks and they are within a couple of weeks of producing enough of the quick tests to test tens of millions of people in short order. It also looks like NY is starting to peak while Ohio and PA seem to be non-issues. It's hard to get the 100k number of deaths without CA, PA and OH."
First time in a long time I can remember someone on one of the CNBC trading shows recommending AIG. Said it should double from here and also said watch for next weeks earnings. I'm hoping he has some inside information.
"Below is Q & A from Cinc. Financial conference call yesterday. Most policies in the industry have a standard limit and to get more you have to pay a higher premium. I may have mentioned here in another thread I believe AIG should say what their maximum hit would be if all policies paid out. One would have to believe their market cap reduction is signficantly greater than the very unlikely potential hit from this. By the way, CINF had an incredibly high amount of their investments in stocks, quite stunning actually. Surprised this is even allowed by regulators.Mark Dwelle -- RBC -- AnalystSo just to make sure I'm following the full flow of information. So you had said initially that around 50% of the typical policies have BI endorsement. And then, within those, the sublimit would start at $25,000 and then to the extent somebody bought it up, it would be to whatever level they chose to pay incremental premium to get to a higher limit?Stephen Michael Spray -- Senior Vice President, Chief Insurance Officer & DirectorThat's correct."
Selling at 42% of Book Value. That is an enormous discount. Of course in a Momentum focused market no one cares and most of the Robin Hood traders don't even know what that means.
"How about over $60, will it ever happen again anytime soon? Long time share holder."

"Seems like it has to be mostly AIG on the other side of the warrant trades. The exercise price is $42 or so plus the price of the warrant so $43. If you're really that interested in it you could pick up another year and buy a 2022 call for 2.70 or 42.70. Believe the average volume for the last 30 days has been over 1/2 million per day. They could have picked up the same number of shares, 10 million, for 10 million dollars that they picked up for 500 million a few weeks ago."
Appears normalized earnings per CFO were $1.26(32 cents investment income was normalization of markets from late 4th qtr drawdown). Pricing strong so hopefully they can get close to $5.00 this year. Just don't understand CEO's aversion to buybacks. Sounds like bull that they were prevented from buybacks due to the preferred. From what I can tell preferred was issued or announced in March. Virtually every other CEO in the world would be buying back stock given the circumstances. His preference for acquisitions will keep the stock depressed as long as he is there. You would think he would give the shareholders a break and let the stock get back to the level when he came in and then perhaps an acquisition. AIG is the cheapest insurance stock he can buy at this point.
"AIG Results Look Grim But Represent Progress -- Heard on the StreetBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 12:29 PM ET 08/04/2020Parting ways isn't always pretty, but sometimes it's also the right thing to do.American International Group ( AIG Loading...Loading...) put up an ugly $7.9 billion net loss in the second quarter. That stems largely from a $6.7 billion accounting loss related to the finalized sale of the vast majority of Fortitude, a specialized reinsurance company, to private-equity firm Carlyle Group and other investors. The sale brought in $2.2 billion of cash and improved AIG's liquidity position -- not a bad thing during a pandemic and economic crisis.But it did have some knock-on accounting effects. Those included the write-down of some prepaid insurance assets and a loss on the sale of assets that were tied to Fortitude's business. Fortunately for AIG investors, though, these losses won't have an impact on its regulatory capital levels, meaning there isn't a potentially dilutive capital raise ahead.The broader point is that AIG continues to make progress in reducing earnings volatility by shedding some ""long tail-risk"" businesses, those with hard-to-quantify, potentially large losses over the long term, and refocusing on its core operations of life and property and casualty insurance. So investors ought to look past the one-time accounting adjustments.Many general insurers have moved away from businesses like Fortitude, which provides reinsurance to legacy insurance and retirement portfolios, including AIG's. Similar businesses have likewise paired up with private-equity investors, like KKR with Global Atlantic or Blackstone with FGL, which have the plentiful capital to absorb tail risk and potentially earn bigger spreads with their investment units.AIG also in the second quarter began giving up some of its premium income as it starts a risk-sharing arrangement via a Lloyd's syndicate for its individual insurance unit for private, high-net-worth clients. Over time, this should help AIG actually grow the book by reducing its catastrophe exposure, and also to collect more fee-like revenue from things like administering claims.The effects of Covid-19 didn't help the quarter, but didn't totally derail it either. In its core businesses, AIG reported a positive adjusted after-tax income of $571 million, the measure the street focuses on. That translates into 66 cents a share, topping an analyst consensus of 50 cents. Covid-19-related losses were a manageable pretax $458 million, though elevated death claims also did contribute to a year-over-year 16% drop in adjusted pretax life and retirement insurance income.So AIG continues to be noisy. But it also is still a beneficiary of some of the industry's positive trends, notably sharply rising rates in commercial insurance. And it now has the capital buffer to offer bigger policies to key clients when others might be pulling back. AIG also noted a rebound in the retail life and retirement sales pipeline in July, which if sustained would help cushion the effect of Covid-19 on mortality rates. The work-from-home trend may also help AIG in its big cost rationalization push.There isn't much to love about the insurance business right now, with continued coronavirus risks and rock-bottom interest rates. But after a 7% share-price drop on Tuesday morning, AIG at least has more potential upside than others as it continues its evolution."
Maybe im confused but why would you exercise your warrants at that price considering current PPS ?
He added $1.5B to buybacks. Good move but too small. Buybacks are key to show some progress until this ship is stabilized.

"Makes no sense. Down 6% on an earnings beat and ok guidance. Hopefully, this unjustified drop will shake out the week hands. I think this is the last quarter with this CEO if next quarters earnings are not better. This has become a dead money stock."
"The CC was surprisingly strong. The bottom line was ugly, no doubt. But they were surprisingly detailed and confident that they could achieve profitable underwriting and 8% ROE for 2019. I don't expect huge upside, but I do think our losses will moderate after the analysts have had time to weigh in. The buyback program was not as neglected as I thought either They might pick up another 40-50M shares during the year as well."
"(NYSE: AIG) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share. The dividend is payable on December 28, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 2020."

"Chub looks OK on today's earnings, depending on whether you consider ""mark-to-market"", which has largely recovered, or ""adjusted"" earnings, which are often fiction. I think (hope) Brian has been sandbagging. AIG has massive AOCI which should absorb much of the ""mark-to-market"" hit. It's time for AIG to emerge as a legitimate competitor. The early earnings report is positive, I hope."
Click on profile and see the 5 top executives pay. 7.78 million 9.83 million 3.98 million 5.86 million 3.88 million. They have lost money this qtr. How about a pay cut for the 1% ??? Never going to happen. They will continue to get free stock and sell for profits. Nothing has changed with this company since the last downturn.

"If buybacks are ""just another tool"", Brian needs to learn how to use it."
"Earnings on the 3rd, after close. CC the following Tuesday morning. I'd welcome opinions, but I am going out on a limb and expect AIG to crush earnings, if for no other reason than they have to. Brian has been in charge for going on 3 & 1/2 years. The stock has lost half its value. If the warrants expire worthless, they are looking at some serious class action, on solid grounds. The warrants were underwater BEFORE covid hit. Brian has been bragging about ""tremendous progress"" throughout his tenure, even when the numbers said otherwise. He's shown contempt for analysts' suggestion that buybacks might help support the stock's price. It's time to prove this ""is not the same company"". Put up, shut up, or give back your outlandish salary Brian."
"Appear to be adding tremendous liquidity which should speed debt reduction(assuming debt is callable) and more importantly buybacks.

Affordable housing will be sold in fourth quarter with 4 billion cash being sent to the parent. 2.2 billion dollars from Blackstone L & R 9.9% deal and then another 2 billion potential from the L & R IPO. Was hard to decipher but it appeared they were intimating on the call that the L & R IPO may go above another 9.9% which would mean more than 2 billion. That's almost 15 BILLION of liquidity excluding earnings. I've cited several times about how they are overcapitalized at both P&C and L&R so it makes sense they would sell investments for cash and then put that cash to work in some fashion.The value of P&C is now roughly 21 billion if you assume the Blackstone valuation of L & R at 22 billion is accurate. Where will they put the 15 BILLION to work? Could they do it all, except the 2 billion buyback in 21? That means 13 BILLION and that excludes earnings for the next two quarters with last quarter's earnings at 1.3 BILLION."
"AIG has changed Presidents and the operations model every few year and the shareholders equity continues to go down. Besides that, continued outsourcing depletes the loyalty of those remaining. My friends who remain all tell me they are just waiting for the day they can retire. It's nothing like the company it was 15 years ago. A shame."
"What happened to Schilling is yet another chilling example of how Chinese Communist social credit score system is being implemented in America.In August 2019, the Communist state bragged about how it had prevented 2.5 million “discredited entities” from purchasing plane tickets and 90,000 people from buying high speed train tickets in the month of July alone."
I think a lot of people are missing the boat here. 96% of the outstanding stock is held by institutions. they make all the rules because they have all the voting stock. the rules will always be in their favor no matter what. essentially the CEO means nothing the board means nothing and the only people that matter are those holding the 96% of the voting shares. they are going to look out for their interest not yours. they don't care if you lose on your warrants.
finally a great quarter. but will anyone see or hear. this could be a 70 or 80 dollar stock in a year or 2 if they perform like this. blackstone will help and the stock repurchase will definitely help. did you notice the last quarters buyback and the fact that share count actually went down. good luck to all if anyone is actually out there.
"Based on a Wells Fargo research report, a fair valuation band is 10-12 times earnings.With 2020 EPS consensus estimates at $5, the stock should trade between $50-$60.With the price near the low of this valuation band, it appears very cheap right now!"
Happy Restructuring day!!

"Three hopes for warrants: Besides the recent bounce, on signs of improved profitability and revenue growth, I also think Brian's retirement is a positive. Sure, he knew what he was doing. Sort of. But he was stuck in second gear and was very rigid in his thinking. If he had been more nimble and flexible he could have financed his slow-walk recovery with profits from modest buybacks. Also, the L&R IPO discussion has highlighted the need for additional equity capital. It's no longer entirely in the common shareholders' interests to let the warrants expire worthless. That extra $2.8B (approximately) garnered when the warrants are exercised could significantly help them split the balance sheet and maybe even reduce the IPO."

"Must apologize about my misunderstanding about how warrants work. Didn't realize that the owners of the warrants will need to pay the $42 or so to the company if they are able to get to the exercise price in 2021. I have read there are 70 million or so outstanding warrants so this would mean an additional 3 billion of cash/capital to the company. One of the aspects of warrant exercise I didn't realize was the company would get this cash. Another aspect is, perhaps because of the cash received, companies are very motivated to move the expiration date. There is also the fact that the warrants were given to their shareholders so you should obviously be motivated to take care of them. I had been pushing for them to purchase as many as possible on the open market as they have been selling for at or under $1 for quite some time and you could remove almost 10% dilution for virtually nothing. I can now see why they may not be so motivated to do this."
"Current market cap is 40B. Based on deal with Hedge Fund for L & R it's worth 22B in their eyes which means the P&C portion of the company is worth 18 BILLION. Chubb's market cap today is roughly 75 BILLION. AIG's fearless leaders have said they may use IPO proceeds to buy stock of the P&C company. Those proceeds should be 4.4 BILLION and they are significantly overcapitalized so they should be able to buy back more than just the 4.4 billion. That puts P&C at a market cap of 13.6 BILLION and again Chubb is worth 75 BILLION. Granted, AIG isn't Chubb, but it ain't that far from it. Assuming P&C gets to under 90 for its ratio by 2022 the profit for P&C could be roughly $4 BILLION and they shouldn't have to case pay tax for a while. The above is a long way of saying the current valuation of this company is NUTS but we've been saying that for a while, haven't we."
"I don't know how they did it. But AIG did a credible job of making a bad quarter look good. Book value, as well as earnings, moved all over the map, depending on which numbers you use. AIG appears healthy and in control of their own destiny. So why is the stock price still in the bargain bin?"
Anyone have any updates about warrants?!!
Chubb preannouncement on catastrophic loss yesterday appears to be positive. After tax is 1/4 of their prior year loss(387m vs 1.5b) so they should report a fairly significant profit for this year's third quarter. Hopefully AIG follows suit.
Whats happening with the warrant is illegal. idk what to do with it anymore
"warrant holder here since original warrant distributions, unfortunately received distributions in a couple different accounts (personal,ira,401k), held long term without really understanding what/why the warrants were distributed since the company was mixed up in the government tarp program at the time. that being said i haven't sold original warrant distributions and have picked up additional warrant positions over the last couple of years trying to dollar-cost average. i've asked my investment house on a couple different occasions about exercising the warrants but after the stock nosedived last january i dug in deeper to dollar-cost average, this is going to be an expensive lesson learned.any purchase at this late stage would appear to be a huge bet the warrant exercise deadline is extended or a particularly risky bet trying to time a few cents upside before selling off or exercising the warrants. one thing i cannot understand is with the pending deadline and new designation of 1/13, 1/15 and 1/19 for trading the warrants and/or exercising the warrants, who would be buying the almost 2.5M AIG/WS @ ~$.10 today?and with the shares trading today around $40.45 nearly $2 below the current $42.2282 warrant exercise price per share, do the numbers make sense to exercise the warrants or just try to sell the warrants before 1/13?current aig price $40.47 divided by 1 share = $40.45 cost per 1 sharecurrent warrant exercise price $42.2282 divided by (no. of shares of aig common stock receivable upon warrant exercise) 1.067 = $39.5766 cost per 1 share$40.45 - $39.5766 = $.8734 profit per share or something like:per 1,000 warrants, $42,228.20 gets 1,067 shares, sold at current $40.45 equals $43,160.15 or $931.95 profit?"
AIG unit to pay $40M to settle SEC charges...
"Brian Duperreault, AIG's CEO, said: ""Our financial results for the fourth quarter and for full year 2019 reflect the significant progress we made over the course of 2019 to position AIG for long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. For the full year 2019, after-tax income attributable to common shareholders was $4.1 billion, or $4.59 per diluted share, and Adjusted ROCE was 8.3%. The improvement in our financial performance over the course of last year was broad-based, with contributions from all of our segments, but most notable was the return to underwriting profitability in General Insurance. The full year combined ratio was 99.6% and the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 96.0%. Life & Retirement also delivered solid results in the face of continued headwinds from low interest rates and tightening credit spreads. Finally, we were pleased to announce that we reached an agreement to sell a majority stake in Fortitude Re, our legacy insurance business, which is scheduled to close mid-year, subject to regulatory approvals."" ""As we look to 2020, we will continue to be laser focused on executing on our strategy to position AIG as both a leading insurance franchise and a top-performing company and we remain committed to achieving a 10% Adjusted ROCE by the end of 2021. In addition to continued work as part of the turnaround of General Insurance, AIG 200 will be a top priority. AIG 200 is our multi-year, enterprise-wide transformation program focused on the long-term strategic positioning of AIG and designed to achieve operational excellence. I remain confident we are on the right path at AIG and am very proud of what our colleagues accomplished since I joined the company in 2017. We entered 2020 with great momentum and excitement about what the future holds for AIG,"" Duperreault added."
