"JFrog is said to be listed on Nasdaq, the said company could possibly have a revenue of approximately $69.3 million. On the contrary, these healthcare sectors are said to have deemed safe and effective vaccine that could create a massive $10 billion market opportunity.

"The recent headlines of the Jfrog Docker merger is a major catalyst for driving the price up and am in disbelief seeing the price in red and down 7% it makes no sense. Its still at great buying levels in the 60s so I hope some are collecting shares. The one thing I appreciate is how fast this stock jumps up so we can make back the loss in a trade day. Stay strong longs, I refuse to sell at these prices. Be sure to set your limits higher to $200+ dont give them a chance to short us down more."
Guys However got money - BUY BUY BUY!!!! the stock is at rock bottom you will double your money by the end of the year for sure ! ENJOY !!!
Down 20% not too shabby
Why this has should low volume and continue to go down? Should have sold it yesterday when l have the chance. Can l see 83 again soon? Any advice? Or like should sell for a loss?
"Jump, Frog, jump! Own 50% of the customers on Fortune 100 companies. Monster growth into the brilliant future. It is an easy $100 dollar stock by year end."
I just got in under $39. Thx for your pain
"FROG, is a buy and hold forever stock, expensive but will always be very expensive. We are in a beginning of a digital transformation where there will be an exponential growth in software and all that code will be updated continuously."
"Buy,buy,buy"
$EBIX this is a great opportunity to average down or enter... short squeeze will be epic! This company didn’t have a good quarter or a good year.. they have already 5 years constant growth! It’s insane! PE is 10 which is unheard of... plus dividends. Say thank you for once in a life time opportunity $TRIT $FROG $ASAN $SUMO
Just broke through 200 DMA
Shorting non stop all day long here above 46
Consolidating. Smart short is covering while no more panic selling.
frog IPO price was $44. current price is a big discount as frog continue to execute and grow its business.
I sold 3 more Feb 19th $80 calls for $2.35 each. I have 28 left.
should i sell bigc or docu and buy frogy yes or no if yes then which one shoukd i sell
Seems like nothing but good news coming out of the company. Can’t understand why this thing isn’t going back up.
95 to 76 in two days that’s a 20% plus fall on no news 
"awesome news i think Cybeats a cyber security software company which is owned by Relay Medical RELA.,CN could be a potential buyout company IMOdo your own DD"
"Adding to FROG position, all the time. Early days of HUGE opportunity"
"Great stock, 30% in 2 weeks and literally the sky is the limit."
Almost at all time lows! Finally! Disclosure: Short $90+
"Here’s something to consider - if the low Billings / pull forward in q2 were truly an issue, it would show up in revenue. The company raised full year revenue guidance and told the market in Q1 this was happening. The research analysts were just too dumb to understand it and forecasted Billings increases. This is one of those inefficiencies to exploit. I don’t see how this doesn’t end up at least a $12B company."
volume is going up
Only for those who still believe.....
Today is a big market red day a large portion of my portfolio is taking a beating so its not just frog. We have to endure through these storms. I feel this one since I recently added to my position a few days ago. Its a tough seat to be in but this red day will not last. I am holding in the red but I am not panic selling it will go back up.

"Ok I’m in!!!! 1,500 shares baby!!!!"
At what price one can buy this first time...?
NASDAQ up 1000 points and FROG  from $95 to $64; its own individual bear  market. $4 from all time lows.
"Wow the day started out looking so promising, rumors are earnings are going to be huge."
I see a few posts blaming shorts. Is it even possible to short? I thought the IPOs cannot be shorted for 30 days.
These are not typical traders selling shares off its the institutional sellers and its been pretty volatile. Both pre market and after market saw pull backs yet it pushed higher during regular hours. Thursday I also believe we will push up past $70 and go higher. This stock has been kept down long enough I'm glad they have there hands full with gamestop amc and all the other ones.
"Some months ago I stated that I liked the company, but It was too expensive at 80. But now that valuation seems more reasonable, I think it's time to buy. Keep calm, that kind of drop happens many times to young companies."
Why is this going down so much? The earnings were excellent!?
(http://financialdeals.tech) has given me the best stock leads! Their emails help me make the most informed trading decisions. A must for any investor!
Which one is better for first time buyer..?FROG. CRM. SNOW SPLK...?
This reminds me of Roku. I bought years ago when it’s market cap was around 5 billion.. and it tanked shortly afterwards. I was down like 30%. Now I’mUp 700%! Ignore the short term if you believe in the business.
Frog - The only red in the sea of green. Figures! I am just averaging down my 100 shares at $76. Going to be out as soon as this reaches break-even point for me.
So sad that I put so much money when it was 71
Everyone read my posts before earnings? Same as FSLY made a small fortune on both. Just learn how to read options charts not too hard. Broken cup & handle. There is no bottom. Came public and down 70%
Buying some discounted shares I cant believe the market has plunged so much but these shares are valuable and when this stock jumps back up I will be glad I have them.
I am shorting more here at $60.55. Will cover $44. 1000 more shares. Also short from $67. Anyone in at $95 two weeks ago?
What’s happening today
FROG is up 6.59% to 53.38
"I bought shares of FROG just now, and keep buying now, buy asap and Hold for long !"
Anyone like the $95 IPO? LOL! Money  printing press for insiders to make money!
I have said this stock will be traded no less than $100 months ago. It is still good to get in now because long term this can be a $200 dollar stock.
"Seems pretty obvious MM has been hinting retail investors to buy regular IPOs despite crazy valuations to fatten their wallet instead of SPACs - However, SPACs have now hit bottom and things will have to reverse soon!SPAC IPO: $LCA $SPAC $GMHI $PIC $HYLN $VLDR $HCAC = down down down (next: up up up up up)Regular IPO: $U $FROG $SNOW, etc = up up up up up (next: ? ? ? ? ?)"
i been watching this since the ipo and been waiting for good entry point. just bought this morning.
Would love to buy in the 65 range but that 25% early lock up equates to a lot of selling.....
Man when I shorted near $95 I didn’t even expect to make money every day of 2021! Falls 10% a day on no news 
What's the reason for the seloff today?
"hello, where you 40-50 price projectors?"
"Nasdaq rebounds UP and is moving UP, buy FROG at bottom range now asap, I keep buying now. Buy and hold for long !"
"I sold 4 of 35 feb 19 $80 calls today for $1.53(93% profit) in average of 3 days. Was that smart, should I have kept them all, or sold them all?"
"uxin solo riot mara, surging in pre market, big swings."
Wow minutes after my last post the earnings came out and I see Jfrog has surpassed its records and closed the quarter in a very successful fashion toppling all estimates. Congratulations to Jfrog staff and congrats to all fellow longs who are apart of this wonderful occasion ....We are on the upward path to new highs !!!
"Calling all Frog holders... Have a leap of Faith, it will jump back soon. This pull back trying to shake off weak hands and allows more major players to come in.."
Too bad every co and government agency under spends what they promise. Government bcuz they’re all Blue state cos
Ribbit  anyone read & listen to my posts $20 is a 100% lock 
this stock is a joke. perfect earnings and it barely goes up.... wow.
Buy and hold it.. 
Let have some green sign
"Insiders don't buy into IPOs to keep the shares, just sayin"
I’m buying more come Monday. The bashing talked me into it
I like the volume ! Good sign!
tomorrow fly like an angel 
Took a starter stake today.
Anyone in @ $95??? Be honest. R.I.P.
Howdy partners........ Frog is consolidating nicely at these low prices what a great sale time for shares. Time to load up more and mosey on to the top of the charts with profit I reckon.
Buy FROG asap and Hold !
"I'm in. Like the technicals and fundamentals too. Gross margin, growth rate, customer list."
Great buying opportunity
Stock price target is still 95$

"For the love of God, Sell Puffy eyes sell"
Go Jfrog I am glad I am sticking to my game plan holding long term baby! Its the best performer in my portfolio today not bad for a red Friday morning !!!!!!
"Earnings not that bad, sell off in after hours way over reaction. Should go up from here after dust settles."
I’m in $39.2 x 800… going to hold this for 2-3 months and expect to get 15% gain.

"Record revenue, record cash flow, growing 30+%, plenty of cash, once integrates Vdoo, could see surprised to upside. looks bullish"
"looks like great report, good growth, cash flow and margin. will buy more"
Anytime now :)
"No reason to go down this much... doesn't even make sense but I will keep holding it and load further. This is the one stock that cannot fail. Perhaps, a short term shorting opportunity, but I wont advise it further. Who knows, we might see sudden bounce back to green today... Fingers crossGreen for Frog please.. No red frog .."
weak hands... get ready to bleed.values will play out just look at the earnings outperformance !
I’ll lay my meat on the table and say that FROG will double in 21. Going long meat on this one.
I dont think there is one stock in the market that isn't making anyone say ouch right now.... what a lousy downturn the s&p has taken this past week has been so harsh for longs. But the thing to remember is how fast frog can leap from 50- 70 and thats what we have to keep up hope for. Unless $APPL $TSLA $MSFT $AMZN and all our other big name stocks start moving this downer will continue. The great news is that these are all incredible companies and this red will not continue. All we can do is hold or buy some dips until the Market regains some regularity. If your reading this then It could always be worse. One thing I cannot allow myself to do is sell any of my precious stocks at a loss... Not with these diamond hands ......Ups and downs are apart of the game if we made it this far through this red storm then we can survive a bit more until it turns around in our favor and lets all hope it will be soon. Diamond hands all day every day !!!
CrwdDdogZsDocuEntire market slid allGood I’m in. It’ll pop to 70 this week
Still bullish on JFROG we are just getting caught up in the wash of the broader market.
"From 90 to 40, then to 90 or may be higher in a year or two. That's how wall street makes money and retail investors lose money. Stay on sidelines, or buy the dip if you believe in the company. Just don't chase high and sell low."

"As jfrog integrates Vdoo in the next few quarters, most likely surprised to the upside"
Jump little froggie jump
This is how the big banks get rich selling to us retail Investors for 50% gain in a day
Come full 5G cycle and this will be a winner. They are the only company out there with instant app updates.
Is this what it feels like to get kicked in the nuts? I sold a few months back for a small profit. Keep watching but no motivation to buy back.
"As someone who got into DT and SPT somewhat early, I am building a full position in frog with limits every $0.25. down to 35 (started at 41). I see strong potential with this name, with the main difference with the latter two I mentioned that this is more of an evangelical sale with more competition. However the fortune 100 penetration, gold standard product, FCF and net retention pushed into it. Sometimes a misunderstanding of a quarter by the market is the opportunity you need. Short term pain for long term gain. Main risk to me is rotation."
Maybe in the $30s I’ll buy
Why is this tanking? Anybody know?
"Just went through ARK Invest IZRL holdings, saw FROG is now part of ETF, pretty sure it was not in ETF last year. Cathie added 20 new Stocks to IZRL ETF. Since it is only one of 7 ARK ETF's there should be a massive inflow of capital flowing into a relatively small market FROG could be on the verge of massive move higher. I love JFROG and due to its 6 billion market cap and massive growth ahead of it, my guess is it one of the stocks ARK IZRL can aggressively disperse new inflows."
My last post was deleted and I also see it got censored ? ... so in this one Ill just repeat simply that although the past couple of days have been red there is no worries here we have big upside potential to all holding strong stay doing so and pick up dip shares if possible because I am very sure we're going back up soon lets see how next week plays out.
this one can not go over 45$
"On the way up trend, I never go against the trend. It should be rising continuously to the next deserved level. Just loaded 5k! $77 may target"
They had some interesting insights about FROG on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Hello everyone, As we continue through the pandemic its a new week and I am expecting the value of this stock to increase rapidly. The new normal is we are relying on computer networking more and more in so many aspects. Streamlining software management and making it faster and easier and more secure are just a few of the benefits a company like JFrog provides and I am glad to be invested here and is why I am expecting new all time highs in the near or distant future. I made a Gif to show some appreciation that all can use and I might make more when I get some time."
"Bought on Monday..Monday DOWN, Tuesday DOWN, Wednesday DOWN, Thursday DOWN, Friday DOWN.You were warned.Have a great weekend.4 handle by the end of next week...GUARANTEED."
Everybody relax! accumulate frog its going backup real soon !
Hey - you who've been long FROG ...is it a good time to initiate a new position?? Thank you for any suggestions....now at 46.49 +1.3%....??
Monday premarket shows FROG is green and up in percentage from last week. This is a positive sign to start the day.
Puffy Eyes needs to sell so this thing can go back up
why short this? I thought they are quite potential
Good price and good opportunity to buy today before flying!
This recovered very quickly after that sudden market pullback and its easy to see why this stock has loads of upside potential.
Saphire Ventures!!!
I've been watching the shares rally from nearly the 52 week low to close today at 51.22. I feel like at this point > $50 that I've missed the bulk of the rally. Any suggestions on a reasonable entry price to initiate a new position? Thank you
Year end profit taking.
How far down will this go?
Average down tomorrow.
I just bought so that should all but guarantee at least another 20% drop.
This was way oversold recently!
I am seeing another short attempt and pressure sell off and it is not to be worried for nobody should be selling this stock under 80's the shorts are trying but they dont have power here I am holding firm and buying back each dip time to take action lets do it !!!!!!!!
"considering the hug pull back of tech stocks (Feb 23, 2021). FROG is doing very well!!!"
"JFrog is trying to shake down their enterprise customers by requiring them to buy XRay, presumably because they have run out of creative new products that people want to buy. Beware of this stock longer term, they are trying to boost up earning with price increases with the assumption that their Enterprise customers are locked in. Microsoft is starting to bundle similar functionality with GitHub at lower prices, there is no need to be locked in to JFrog, and it isn't a good sign that new customers would choose to pay these higher prices for something that used to be free/open source."
Seems like a squeeze is already happening
"Hi buyers above $70, why do you think it is worth 70% more than the banks priced it at? Just curious.."
just bought another 100
"I ordered an ""up"" Frog..."
I am not selling a single share of this. Keeping it till $100.
JFrog is up 6.88% to 37.30
Weekend Gap Up...Big Squeeze coming
Can probably buy some more here...
You must trust this is a great company has huge potential. Hold on to all your shares and add with any weakness and pull back. You will never be disappointed by owning this stock for long term.
will break 70 barrier tomorrow (jan 28)
In for 10 shares. Will I be a millionaire soon?
200 ton train wreck…
"Today looks like its doing nicely. BTW I read the comments here and I just want to put my 2 cents in that patience is important for any stock position. Yes the earnings was fantastic but the market has shown us that it does not always cause prices to go up right away. Take tesla or apple for example, even with the big earnings the market can remain stagnant or even pull back with positive earnings news and then pick a random day days or weeks later to make big moves. With FROG I will leave my shares because I don't want to miss the next big Jumps. I also think some price upgrades will be on the way as well. When I see some triple digits then we can talk selling !!"
"I just bought in another 100 shares at 69.50, wish me luck"
jfrog is very widely use tool. Anyone with tech background can confirm advantages of using artifcatory compared to similar other products. We have used it in our org and have seen great cost savings while using it across regions and all different platforms.
just bought the dip with a small amount... all benchmark is red. should not affect long term prediction for this stock
As I understand JFrog is just a build software company. It managed to get some big clients and this is not innovative company. I am glad I was out at $65. Well I have some bag holding in other companies but not this one.
"FROG (jfrog), provides DevOps platform for continuous software release mgmt. and major companies across the globe moving to cloud and required to add/change dynamic content based on consumer demand and tasty to compete highly digitalized market that required a platform to keep the various versions of code and changes, that is where JFROG come into picture and we see a lot of growth ahead for this company and currently sitting around 6.3B market cap and it could be easily double or triple in next couple of years."
"Buy $FROG at $60, sell at $70. Rinse and Repeat."
I would load up for this one and Q3 result would be great
FROG or SNOW?
I am very invested in JFROG and have been averaging down almost monthly since October 2020. My concern is the significant drop in volume month over month since the locked shares were fully released in February/March 2021. I think the company is excellent and I see a high potential to the upside but that might not be for 2-3 years. They are already at a pretty high multiple now which I think will result in a very bumpy ride to get to a new high months from now.
The stock market took a step back today and no matter what at least I know the fundamentals here are as solid as it gets. We just had a great earnings not that long ago and big name companies continue to utilize JFrog services. Until those same big companies like Google and amazon and apple start going in the green we will also be dragged in the red. Today nearly the entire market including all the big names are in the red but it wont last eventually we will see more up side.
"I told/warned you all last week that since I bought the stock will go down at least another 20%, probably more. Not too many guarantee's in life but death, taxes and RED, RED, RED once I buy in. Down EVERY day so far since my purchase last week."
Jump to the 90$ again . Long term very bullish on this stock
Add to that FROG has 600 million in cash. That make enterprise value around 3.5B. That's quite an attractive valuation in this market where much slower growing mid cap enterprise software companies like TEAM sale for over 30 times EV. FROG should have never gone below 55. I think it has so far down due to recent lockup expiration and because it is thinly traded. 1 Million volume easily pushes it down $2-$3.
"There is so much upside on Jfrog its only a matter of time before this stock hits triple digits. I agree with the bullish comments and its nice seeing those of you with similar views on this. Basically, it comes down to the company fundamentals and the actual business which happens to be incredibly useful to companies managing software and this will continue and be more used in the foreseeable future. Even the stock charts itself shows anytime this thing is in the 60's range its a great opportunity to load up pure and wild and then soar to the clouds."
Fair value is 115.66
Open order 200 x 60.08 again
Fair value is 114.76
Buy FROG asap and Hold ! I keep buying now !
Lucky Frog for me......Got in at 61 and sold at 70 and then got in at 35 and sold at 46.Got back in at 39.5 now :)Wasn't deliberate...I just needed money.
I bought $snow but sold at loss to buy this. Down a bit but this going to $150 by the end of the week.
nice frog day.
Frog is very strong most high tech are down and Frog is up great stock almost $37 now. If market good shape than $40 above soon. Wait and see today pass $38 or not
Going to 77$ very soon.a lot investors in Israel buying.buy and hold for one year.
We will move up after the conference today… lets sit back and see
Going to 75$ some investors in Israel buying.
Frog 50 by next week. Buy any dips we will see 60 in July
"Just like Fastly (FSLY), this can drop by 30% at any time. Very risky bet."
"Look at the broader IPO markets which all rally today, $LMND, $AI, $DASH, $FROG just to name a few. Should'd expect the short squeeze given $SNOW was heavily shorted (22% of 50.7M before lockup). Take a look at $LMND lockup play at Dec. 28, shares down 14% one day before lockup and Dec. 29 squeeze. Certainly there's a pattern.. Still alive, will keep an eye out on the next lockup on March."
"The solution is Liquid Software. “This is JFrog’s vision but the world’s mission,” said Haim, describing the solution as fast, automated, secure updates that “flow seamlessly all the way from the creator to the consumer.”If this seems like an idealized future, think again. “Liquid software is already happening,” Haim stated. “What version of Facebook are you currently using? I bet you don’t know. What version of Zoom are we using for this interview? We don’t know because it is happening behind the scenes.”Over 6,000 companies, including the vast majority of the Fortune 500, are already JFrog clients, according to Haim. As they move to hybrid and multicloud strategies, the need for fast, non-disruptive updates is ever more important."
SAP reported bad earnings. Software stocks down. This stock went up too fast. Taking profits.

"it's funny but when I saw the results, even though they were good, I thought ""that's a minus 8% day on tap"". On the upside for longs we're back to the IPO price...so any weak hands that wanted to sell, they're already out."
"so can anyone tell me and explain to me in layman's terms exactly what this company does. I know nothing about computing, but would like know if I invest in the company what it does. I've read the info on it and it's too technical for me, so can anyone try to explain it to me we're I could understand. thank you"
Okay I am guessing we will have the conference call and official earnings transcripts after the bell but as I said either way I am holding my positions and ready to add more to my position if it goes down or up today. The news article released from GlobeNewswire right here on yahoo finance was such a big help and gave me the first bit of great news that at the time I was hoping to hear ...the timing was great. So while more news awaits I am more than ready to continue my investment here no matter what the market decides usually I am quiet in the back ground but with earnings and the company being a newer IPO every earnings are looked at with anticipation. Holding long and strong till triple digits and new highs are made !!!
"IPO price was $44, earnings looks good.. record revenue and cash flow"
Holding for 5 years then look back......
As of this morning (Jan 25). The vol starting picking up now.
Own high $76 dollar a share for 16000 shares. I still believe long term target price of $90 dollar a share.
"I am not holding any position in FROG but I have to say people should realized that anyone won’t get a shot of a vaccine, even if ready, before 4 to 6 months at least. If not much more. So Cloud will be very much absorbed by businesses over Q42020 and Q12021, at least. That’s why I wouldn’t start a position now, as this is likely the month in which also Moderna, NVAX etc. will announce their probably positive results. So clouds stock could get beated even more (maybe all but NET which has a 100% China exposure). But when it comes December, it will be clear that will still take long before anyone gets a shot. Hence, investors will focus on all the earning reports that will come out on January. Bottom line: - if you are holding this, patience *a lot* and you’ll likely go back to previous levels between December and January. - If you are not, but want to start a position in Frog (like me), then wait December for a sweet entry spot. That’s my reasoning at least. Happy to hear yours."
did anyone buy in above 72 ?
Growth in the DevOps and DevSecOps area is accelerating rapidly. at some point it will go parabolic. Expect increased growth for tools like Artifactory and Xray.
Getting ready to BUY :)
Share offering bought up soon. Price expect to jump up!
people who sold at 35 are such noble souls I was able to buy some
Expect sub 30
"FROG is going higher just a matter of time, seen EXPLOSIVE moves in all the other platform stocks I bought, hard to believe this stock is going to be any different. Demand for growth stocks is only growing, and sooner or later those Robinhood pirates are going to make a run at FROG"
the shorts better get out while they can
"From Yahoo Profile, ""JFrog Ltd. provides DevOps platform to achieve continuous software release management platform enabling organizations to deliver software updates across any system."" More Software, More need for Software updates, MORE MONEY! FROG is going to make it Rain Gold for Decades!"
Finally some sign of life in Frog... How high can Frog really jump?
Bag holders welcomed
Anyone knows what happened? Upgrade?
Thankfully the market sentiment is changing from the last few weeks and I am not kidding when I say I expect the price to rapidly jump and remain in higher levels especially after the positive earnings we had before the market pulled back.
It is time for frog to jump?? hoping it can reach to $66 today.This is so undervalued stock. It should be at least $75 to $80
folks really don't realize how strong this company is.. hold tight and you will be rewarded.
jusf bought at 57.57
Sold made 650/700 later
"BOUGHT AT 57.5, Israeli company with costumers as YouTube, Netflix and more will no disappoint"
That $46.50 short was the most obvious ever in the history of the stock market 
I dont know whats causing this pull back premarket red but the fundementals are the same and I am holding pass this storm because I trust this stock can surpass $100 so I am buying in on the red dips.
"Hold out this stock for a few years and you will be vastly awarded, trust me. FROG is a rare gem and you will see the stock price in the $300 dollar level in a few years."
I feel like I need to invest just because of the symbol name.
"good luck to the shortists on this one..valuations trading at a lower multiple to sales than SNOW ( FROG, 16, SNOW 120x)closer to a profit zone than SNOW I'd say this has a better chance at melting the snow than snow"
Who is in FROG  @ $95 IPO right to $30’s? Worst IPO in the last 50 years! Just read that in a major financial publication. Congrats  to all who picked the exact opposite of Tesla
It is back
"20% on day first get ready. I don’t work for the company, don’t know anyone there, btw... just keep your eyes open for it"
"FROG should start gaining up soon, it has been rally around this level for sometimes and changing hand. Expect a big leap when that happens. Looking great!"
45 is the mark now jump frogy
We really need this Frog to jump higher not lower...
"It is heavily shorted. As long as it grows, it cannot stay at this low forever."
"I will strongly advise not to short this, sell if you want, but not short..There are going to be a big buy soon. Reaching $90 is just a matter of time.Shorts, you know your days were short on this... seriously for your own good."
Well isn't this great?! Same story every day up in the morning and down in the evening....
My HUSBAND thinks I should try out for dancing with the STARS.....OH MY
"Only a matter of time before this frog starts jumping up in share prices. learning from past lessons patience is vital when dealing with the market red days especially when its a quality stock and company such as this. Let them sell off irrationally, makes it easy for me to get those sweet discounted shares. I tried to tell em but ... sometimes they must learn the hard way...."
buy and hold.remember !!!
The moment you down then the moment you are up... bouncing up and down and up. Weak hands selling for year end tax purpose? Be prepared for the sudden jump
"im here from $64 Per Share, NOT SELLING A DIME!"
Look at ZI. IPO first day was $60 and now $30
 super jump!
Disclosure: Short around $95 and $46 into “earnings” losses
"This is what they do to all good stocks, big institutions will shake weak hands then scoop up the cheap shares!"
"Many trying to short selling this at the same time? Careful...I see the opposite, it will increase suddenly for sure. Just hold tight and be really patient."
just bought more. my average is 63 now. these high flactuations means this is a the cheap price (as i see it at least). hoping for 3 digit until the end of the year. anyway im here for the long run. good luck all
Net retention of 130%? Free cash flow? 50B TaM? Loooooooong
"Hello, does anyone still remember this stock?"
I got in $75 and will keep adding more shares.
I grabbed some @ 69 flat
What would be a fair price ? Great company not yet completed my analysis ..... any suggestions
So today is the day that 25% of Locked up shares can be sold... I'd have to say the insiders are NOT selling. What does that tell you...
This FROG is in trouble.
Will be up another 10%
And I sold
"Compare with SNOW, the value of Frog is much reasonable and it will be profitable very soon"
"Cathy Wood of Ark Investment does indeed hold JFrog in her ""Israeli Innovation Index"". This is a huge positive statement on the future hyper-growth potential of JFrog."
FROG  has to rise 60% from here to break even from two weeks ago!!!!!
"Is wall street dumping the Frog? There are 75% of the major companies using this and they dont see any upside? Disappointing day indeed... The more the management is keeping silent, the further downward this is... Do something"
its blood bath for israeli tech and jfrog is one of the best ones
I am glad I listened to the guy that said FROG would be $100 by the end of the year.
Frog is jumping up beautiful again
"8/16/2021 Morgan Stanley 1,364,962 $62.13M 0.0% -60.5% 1.481%Morgan Stanley unloaded 60.5% shares of jFrog before they released this report. Typical manipulation."
I feel like this is a good spot to start a position
"Below IPO, what a catch...buy hold 2-3 years then sell"
"Ok I’m only down a little I have 62.56 in each share x 1,500 so I’ll set a sale price for tomorrow at 63.00 and make 750 bucks hopefully"
"I expect a earnings upside surprise next week as many gave up after overvalued cries, a huh, sure it is but snowflake, tsla isn't.BUY it! BUY Ntnx..."
with earnings coinciding 3 or 4 Nov on election day there is a good chance this piece will fly to 100
"Just joined, bought 150 shares. thanks for the cheap shares :)"
Super frog!!! 
100% going to $44. Save this post!!!
"As the quiet period expires, Needham initiates JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) at Buy with an $89 price target."
"Best cloud solutions company out there, glad to get it so so cheap"
All analysts are still bullish. Stock dropping because of overreaction to price target declines bc idiotic analysts didn’t understand Billings pull forward to Q1. Everything on track and a major opportunity to buy low.
"This is a bad week to buy stocks. We may get a contested election, volatility is increasing. Big investors moving to cash for safety. Be safe in short term."
Just give FROG a little time and it'll surprise you.
Wow first room in which investors are taking cautious approach I am impressed
this is going to pop big time ...just a matter of time
I’m back in! 500 shares x 63.58 open order to sell 500 x 64.38!!!! Show me the money honey!!!
"FROG has performed as promised since it’s IPO, earnings release in line with expectations ￼and should not be training below its IPO price of $44 a share.￼ Some weak hands being shaken out today, the stock should bounce back nicely next week￼! I bought today at $35.34. Which comes out to about 50% off given revised price targets! ￼"
52 week low today. BUY
Only has to rise 50% to break even from 3 weeks ago lolllllll
Will break70 this week. !!!
Ok boys this is it! 25 percent early lock up! Swing trade time!!!!!  whats a good price to buy in to start??? 40s? 50?
when frog reports earnings?
AH hedge fund manipulation
"I learned from my first mistake, not to jump in at IPO date, eventually stocks come down later on, also when Unlocking period occur. Solid company, but not jumping at this price, it'll come down!!!"
"Averaged down, so now have full position at 39.5. This is in the range of what JFrog initially planned for IPO (39-41). Happy to sit on this for years and wait for growing revenues. I'm from the industry, JFrog is very well known and respected in the DevOps world"
Down 20% to a new all time low on 200% volume increase down 70% from recent highs has this been a good IPO?
Frog Nation!!!!!!!! Let's go baby!!!!!!!
Is FROG  $95 haven’t looked in a while 
"Type in your search ""Jfrog forward PE"""
I am an options player FROG  put options are set up exactly like FSLY into earnings; I wanted them all at $45 and I am warning you all
"Institutions are keeping buying if you check marketbeat.In Q1, bought 426M, sold 151MIn Q2, bought 429M, sold 27M"
No reason to be down.....going back up fast.
