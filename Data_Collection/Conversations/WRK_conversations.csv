"A couple of notes for WRK which also applies to IP and PKG, but to a lesser extent since their balance sheets are slightly better and much better.Credit markets are currently not working well. WRK has a small $100 million debt coming due in June. They will not and I repeat not be borrowing at zero. They have current bonds selling below par at much higher interest rates. You cannot assume their dividend is safe. I am not saying it is going away, but you cannot assume it is safe. We do not know how much of their business has been impacted. Not all of their business is Amazon. They have packaging business with companies whose business has been impacted by the shutdown. All three have of the packaging giants have commercial printing or office paper business that will be impacted by the shutdown. It is a fact...point of sales displays in stores will not be need for awhile.The packaging companies can cut back capex to a certain point, delay maintenance since in most cases they may have no choice. In the case of IP and PKG they can stop buybacks which is a given to protect cash flow. Debt payments come first.My only guess at this point is the market is discounting the dividends by at least a third."
"I think container board and Packaging stocks are about to move higher. Here's why: Take a look at the ticker PKG (Packaging Corporation of America). Its stock price hit a 52 week high on October 11, 2019. Both IP and WRK are direct competitors with PKG. Both IP and WRK are only a few dollars up from their 52 week lows. This is know as a ""MARKET DISLOCATION"". There is no way that IP & WRK are doing terrible while PKG is doing great. I don't think that PKG is mis-priced. I am therefore concluding that IP & WRK are mis-priced. IP just raised their dividend 2.5%. WRK just took 288,000 tons of linerboard off the market in addition to consolidating the market with their purchase of Kapstone. Fundamentals are definitely improving and I don't think that Wall Street has caught on yet. We will know for sure with this quarter's earnings reports. I will post this message on the IP message board as well. GLTA"
"Well, I am on board. Good luck longs!"
"If you look at price/sales and price/book this stock is trading extremely cheap! Not saying that makes it a good stock for the short term, but if you have a long term view this could be a big winner."
"Box sales up 4.5%. Huge cash flow. This should be going up, not down."
"Running the numbers there was no short term need for the divy cut, however if they actually apply the 400M-ish saving to extra debt repayment then long term this could be good thing."
"I seldom get ""VERY BULLISH"", but this earnings report impressed me. EPS beat by 5-6 cents depending on who's estimate you use. Great cash flow generation. Kapstone fully integrated. Paid off $.5B in debt , which strengthened the balance sheet. Raised the dividend by 2.2% (because they could afford to). Dividend now 5%. To produce these results in a tough operating environment is awesome. Each quarter the balance sheet will become stronger. Current valuation by any financial measure is very low. Why would anyone sell this stock with that picture? Full disclosure......I have a good position in this stock but I'm thinking about buying more."
"$9.4BB debts, very little cash! Nooope!"
I’ll never forget how many people escaped from this stock at 55. It was like being lost at sea and someone came to rescue you hahah….
I have a friend who works at their most profitable mill here in the states (VA) and they have postponed their annual ‘outage’ where they shut down to repair and prepare their mill for the year. This was done partly due to the fact that they bring in over 1000+ contractors from around the world to help with maintenance and that is a risk WSTRCK isnt willing to take rn. When i know more i will share. Cheers.
"Steve Grasso was on the Fast Money show on CNBC after hours and he was saying that WRK stock fell based on the analyst using ""old data"" picked up at an industry conference, and releasing it. If this is true and the analyst is presenting historical data to ""intentionally deceive"" the retail investors lawsuits should follow."
"This is why you don’t hold hack dividend stocks long term. Glad I kicked this to the curb a while back. Buy back in low, sell the rip…"
"Cheap price on this one. Solid company, earnings and a foundation for future success. It will be going back up...40, 50, 60+"
"Was waiting to scoop up some WRK. Today is it, I guess."
"OK.....I going to help out those who don't bother doing the research. Go to the Westrock website and view the most recent presentation that provides guidance for 2019. You will see that they are say earnings will be $4.09/share for calendar year 2018. They also say that earnings for 2019 will be $4.60/share. In the presentation WRK says 38% of the $4.60/sh ($1.75) will be in the first half of 2019 and 62% of the $4.60/sh ($2.85) will be in the second half of 2019. So lets divy it up Q1-$0.85, Q2-$0.90, Q3-$1.40, and Q4-$1.45. So here's what you need to know. Q1 estimate is $0.80/sh....they will likely beat it by 1-5 cents. 2Q guidance will be slightly higher. In Q3 the synergies/cost savings/accretive earnings from the Kapstone buyout hits the books and earnings jump by 50%. Make sure you own this stock going into Q3. You are welcome."
All the hedge funds that shorted it and then sold it off are buying it back steady in the aftermarket. Just about every day.
"simply buy and put away, $55 sooner than you think"
Looking good to $60+
"I am OK with this earnings report. They are making the right moves, including the dividend cut. The estimate was $0.60 adjusted. WestRock reported $0.67 adjusted. Dividend yield is still 2.7% after the cut. I am holding but also I'm more inclined to buy than sell here."
VERY GOOD earnings report (beat by $0.10) and increased forward guidance for EBITDA and cash flow. The stock is too low given the great fundamentals. I'll hold my stock and potentially buy some more with the 5% yield that is SOLID.
