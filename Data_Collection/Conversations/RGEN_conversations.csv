jim is that you buying....??
Why the down move today ?
Nothing has changed except we are a high growth stock that got a little ahead of itself......seems like $252 will be the bottom. Would never bet against Hunt and repligen they are as golden as u can get!
New highs day after day. I sent another email to the company Investors Relation asking them to consider a 10 for 1 stock split bringing the share price down to about $27 a share. It would increase liquidity and I believe it would be good for both the company and it's shareholders. Many investors like to buy in lots of 100 or 1000 shares and at today's share price the small investors may be forced to buy 10 or 12 shares. I hope the company considers it.
"Tomorrow the stock should go up ,It is usually the day after earnings ."
Now what? Down $18.00
"strong moves, high Zacks rating,...news coming...!"
God I wish all my stocks had the management RGEN has.
Price target raised to $368.00https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/UPDATE%3A+Repligen+%28RGEN%29+PT+Raised+to+%24368+at+Craig-Hallum+After+NDR/18984436.html
A 5.837 share trade in AH trading. That's $1.56 million.
Repligen is simply firing on all cylinders and will continue to. This under the radar gem is slowly becoming one of my favorite stocks in my holdings.
getting into this stock today
I wonder if we could be listed on the NASDAQ 100 in December
Glad I changed that limit. This is Market wide pull down.
Fantastic!
