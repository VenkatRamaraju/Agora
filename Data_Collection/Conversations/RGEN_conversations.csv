demand for their products going up...booster research..flu season coming kids.....
$65.49 in AH trading. Tonight's PR will take the wind out of the sail for awhile.
Does someone have any information about the reason of this fall?
More talk about Monoclonal antibodies on CNBC.......good for rgen
"strong moves, high Zacks rating,...news coming...!"
Stock has taken a battering in one week. It's been highly recommended.What is going on?
Put in a bid this morning for another 200 shares and may pick up more when a bank transfer is confirmed.
This is taking a much needed pause after a great run but I fully expect to see it moving into the $165 or higher level.
early in the day...again...
"I'm amazed by the consistent low volume....after that blowout earning and huge forecast, thought the daily volume would steadily increase w hedge funds......odd"
I'm guessing that RGEN is suffering from the fallout of the overall NASDAQ beating. My other tech and Bio stocks are sinking as well. I suspect that this may fall further before recovering. We will ride it out. I'm still a big believer in RGEN.
nice move again...
hopefully people now know this is not a one shot wonder...they beat like clockwork...the revenue continues to flow...
Great ER. Handily beat estimates.
split...?
I had this for many years at around a dollar a share.
So RGEN announces it's going from small cal to mid cap and the stock tanks in AH trading. What's up?
I agree...adding a bit here. earnings were great and stock coming out of long base. buy the pull back here...imo. also volume today is not wicked high
It has been a year or more since I looked at rgen. Oh wow!! 85??? MC of 4+B?? PE ratio 170??Certainly a huge amount of expectations is priced in. Good luck  Looks overpriced but the boom market continues I guess
"Regeneron ($RGEN) is rumored to be buying out INO after a joint patent application todayDiscussion$RGEN ($185.22) jointly filed an important patent on May 6 2021 with $INO ($6.51) ]http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=523&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=%22*%22&p=11&OS=. They have been working closely on a treatment for brain cancer, GBM, together. The market for GBM treatment globally is around $400 million with current treatments essentially palliative in nature [2,3].Regeneron ($RGN) is rumored to be buying out Inovio ($INO) at around $30 a share. Look for news on Bloomberg terminal and (https://www.prnewswire.com/) in the next 7 days. With Inovio currently around ~$6.5 this would equate to 500% gain on common share and of course much more on call options. This stock is also heavily shorted by Citadel et al. Upward movement on $INO would cause them to cover their short positions which would potentially act as a catalyst for $GME."
I am just as confused as the rest of the board. We just got promoted to a 400 mid cap and this is our promotion?
"I'm curious as well. It seems that they have been doing all of the acquiring but will that change? I bought this stock at avg cost of 3$ years ago and often wondered if I had made a huge mistake. Very glad I held. It's like hitting the lottery. From what I see it looks like they are well positioned for growth. I'd like to see stronger earnings and a lower PE, but I think that is coming in time."
I bought 4000 shares of this at about $3.60 a share and added another 2000 shares at about $5. It's had it's periods where it would slowly move higher and have resistance at about the $44 a share level and actually dropped back to about $29 a share making me wonder if I should sell. So glad I didn't. Days like today are lick winning the daily 4 lottery. Lately it's been day after day. Perhaps we see $60 in the near future. Good luck.
Huge drop today. What's up?
Up another $5 in Pre Mkt.
"Well, I have really taken it in the shorts on this one by about $14 per share. I pray that it recovers quickly."
Told ya ....easy easy call....so many headwinds and history.
RGEN 220! What's going on today?
"I bought this stock very cheap years ago ,I'm happy."
"Good move cheap money.They have been good caretakers of my money .I bought in years ago at around a dollar a share,sold some over the years but kept most. Still have a lot."
Great quarter!
Stock took a big hit today. Down about $10 from where it was last week. This administration is for National Healthcare and that may not be good for some medical related stocks. Although procedures at abortion clinics could see a big increase.
Why does this stock make these runs higher and then give it all back?
Zero resistance rated # 1. Where do we go from here?
I am loving this stock!
Blowout quarter!
nice pm move..encouraging...
So the CEO is given another $1.3 million in shares to go along with the $113.5 million he already had. Meanwhile the stock drops 7% on the news. https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/repligen-RGEN/stock-news/79397334/statement-of-changes-in-beneficial-ownership-4
"$240.00, that came quicker than I expected."
"Repligen raised CEO Tony Hunt's pay from $3,044,785 in 2017 to $13,893,326 last year — an increase of 356 percent."
Does anyone know what to do when locked out of Robinhood for four days? No customer service help as I watch thousands go down the drain because I cannot sell failing stocks and options. Cutting losses would be nice at this point.
Look at all the shares the C/O dumped on Monday. https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/repligen-RGEN/stock-news/80711015/statement-of-changes-in-beneficial-ownership-4
great results again
"In Feb 2018, the price was around $36 bucks. Its approaching $60 now. It doesn't seem too bad. I bought my 10,000 shares around $4 and sat on them for years. With their acquisitions and product pipeline I think that we will see added value increase. just my opinion."
Why is stock taking such a big hit today?
tomorrow...yep!
james you're right! in business since 1981...700M in cash...significant BIOTECHNOLOGY...quality buyout....
Hold and retire early.
Something BIG is going on!
I just listened to the webcast and I heard nothing that would justify the selling we are seeing today. I have to believe we are going to see a nice recovery in the days ahead.
"Looks like we may trade higher today on news of acquisition of Albany, New York based Engineered Molding Technology."
What a great report.
There was a one time 10 million dollar equity grant (bonus) that is a one time.
getting into this stock today
This looks like a nice opportunity to buy at a discount. It would not surprise me if we end up green today.
strong moves into the weekend wth momentum ....
The company continues to make great decisions and is well positioned for the future. I'm glad that I've held on for all of these years. It languished at the 5$ to 6$ dollar range for so long.
"How nice to be able to buy 25,000 shares for $810,000 and then turn right around and sell them for $7,350,000. https://ih.advfn.com/stock-market/NASDAQ/repligen-RGEN/stock-news/86040318/statement-of-changes-in-beneficial-ownership-4"
"From the last earning report ""We anticipate COVID vaccine and therapeutic programs will contribute approximately 25% to 27% of overall revenue, and our non-COVID base business to grow at/or above 20%"""
Walter Herihy was a great CEO he made himself and the early investors some great money .Thanks Walter!
Anyone able to listen to conference call? It won't open for me.
Good move over the years Walter Herlihy. the old CEO created one of the great companies.
Tony Hunt getting richer again. Buying shares for $26 a share and selling them for $149 a share. Who needs a salary when you have this kind of gig going on?
I would love to see te company do a 10 for 1 stock split to get the share price down and for liquidity.
A lot of pharma and biotech companies are using RGEN products.
RGEN will probably move up in price as the institutions evaluate their earnings report.
"Repligen stock is in buy zone after breaking out of a cup base with a buy point of 212.65. Aggressive investors could have used 200.29 as an early entry as RGEN stock cleared a handle that was too low in the base.The RS line for RGEN stock is currently spiking. It comes after the stock jumped more than 107% during 2020, outperforming the broader sector. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Paul Knight is rating Repligen stock as overweight with a 241 target.Track the performance of the stock here: https://zyne.com/stock/RGEN."
ct@buysidebio·4mI think $MXCT is the next $RGEN. TMO should scoop them sooner than later
God I wish all my stocks had the management RGEN has.
New highs day after day. I sent another email to the company Investors Relation asking them to consider a 10 for 1 stock split bringing the share price down to about $27 a share. It would increase liquidity and I believe it would be good for both the company and it's shareholders. Many investors like to buy in lots of 100 or 1000 shares and at today's share price the small investors may be forced to buy 10 or 12 shares. I hope the company considers it.
Taking out stops to accumulate. Dont be fooled.
"Very good conference call ,fantastic! Very good future !"
nice start..early in the day...
Thinking of selling QGEN for RGEN or just add RGEN to portfolio?
I'm seeing a good comeback. A Rainbow after the rain on this one. Buying more at 116
Should have known this was going to happen when company execs cashed in over $8 million worth of shares in the last month and then bought thousands of stock options for under $17 a share. What a racket they have going.
when they got rid of the old old CEO and installed Walter Herlihy. The turn around began. Thanks Walter!
amazing!
nice week here .. wished I would have held on to what I had earlier this year with this one! Have a great weekend winnees
FANTASTIC!!!!!
