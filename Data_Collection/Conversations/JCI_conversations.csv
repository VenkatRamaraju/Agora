Johnson Controls is up 6.12% to 39.52
"Not many reactions here. I researched this company two years ago. I liked what I saw, especially their products that are better for the environment."
Will there be an announcement of Power Solutions being spun off to consolidate focus in next qtr? How does this fit in with AQMS LEAD purchases?
Partnering with Patriot One Technologies (PTOTF) ...OHHHH yea...this technology should change security as we know it.
"Pretty amazing, how one of America's great companies has sunk to new lows. On the day of earnings, not one post, nor has there been a legit one for eight days, volumes are not even going to meet normal average volumes. Such a sad state of affairs for a company which has the potential to be the money making version of Telsa/Solar City/Giga Factory but failed to be able to figure out how to capitalize on the Building Efficiency Group, Energy Storage Group and Automotive Experience Group, instead they focused on Building Efficiency Group with the acquisition of Tyco and the divestiture of Adient and sale of Battery Group. Simply gross mismanagement."
I held and acquired JCI since the mid 80’s and sold them all when they reached $50 a few years ago. I never looked back. The decisions made by Molinaro have been a disaster. The move out of the U.S. was extremely irresponsible. A seriously mismanaged company now.
Is anyone shocked by this? George Oliver special- cut cost to hit earnings and never grow revenue. Until the point where he has cut SO deep that there are no more cost to cut and that’s what you call- a death spiral.
Share buy back is a really good look here. Good time to be long.
"UTX and RTN *crushed* on earnings, should bode well for JCI. Earnings out November 7th. Can't wait! Need something to blow away the cobwebs here."
"Wow, I used to love this company, then we get the tax inversion deal with Tyco, the spin off of ADNT and now the spin off of the energy management division. It amazes how this company in its attempts to focus on a single sector has really weaken the company's ability to handle various market conditions. I know people think that the automotive sector is very economic sensitive and lower margins, but the two auto divisions worked well with the BE division as they were the zig to the zag. Not sure about this one anymore."
This is a great investment with a PE less than 7. Undervalued! Soon to $45.
"Bought this at over $7 last week. It blew threw a stop loss so I was like fk it, let it ride. So glad I did. This is a long term hold. I also bought some $JCI today. Should be a great partnership on this project and good infrastructure/building/clean energy play."
seems a cyclical play...time to buy
"Any JCI stock owned at the end of today 9-2-2016 will be converted. 16% +/- of everyone's holdings will be turned into cash at $34.88/share (the Jan 25, 2016 price), the rest (84% +/-) will be converted to the new company Johnson Controls International plc an Ireland based company, probably at a new basis of whatever today's closing price is. I don't know if that would be JCI's or TYC's (Tyco) closing. They are very close. I don't think many of today's buyers realize they will take a haircut of over $10 per share on 16% of what they own at end of day today (9-2-2016)"
"After 13 Qs, JCI has increased it dividend 3.85%; 0.26/Q to 0.27/Q.Progress..."
Curious why JCI is so undervalued? Any thoughts? I see fair value around 108
Time to buy
I believe this could be in for a break-out as it is currently under valued.
this company has been going down hill for a while. many employees are unhappy in Service department offices. they dont give any raises anymore just pass it on to the CEO. offices have been cutting back recently and taking more benefits from employees. they count every bean.. I think jci stock is going down after earnings atleast.
Thinking of buying this stock to hold for the next 2 or 3 years. What's the inside scoop in this company on trying to produce lithium batteries for EV production?
"Does anyone know if Johnson shareholders will receive stock in BBU from the sale of the Power Solutions, similar to the way Adient was handled, or will shareholders only see a change in dividends?"
"I am still trying to understand why this was beneficial. I own 100 shares of JCI. After the transaction, I own 83 shares of JCI and received $572.93 in cash. Or another way to look at it, I sold 17 shares for $572.93 or $33.70 per share. JCI shares closed at $48.90 on 9/6/2016. Per my calculation I lost $258.37 on the transaction. ($48.90 - $33.70) X 17 = $258.37 Am I missing something?"
"With the world's attention on COVID 19, air change in buildings, etc shouldn't this stock be ""bullish""? I rarely hear anything out of R&D or future developments. Someone give me a reason to ever buy this stock. The dividend is not enough of an incentive."
Still waiting on dust to settle for JCI on etrade.. has anyone seen their shares be updated somewhere? Or know when the cash & share event will happen?
when is the announcement on final use of proceeds ... special dividend ... buyback ... debt repayment ... ?
Headed for 20% earnings beat
If any real weakness develops with today's GS sell JCI is a buy. GS is a little late with their recommendation.
Look at it go
Big Acquisition
"Still laughing about the company wanting to buy back my shares at $42 just a few years ago, the funny thing is that that was about the market price at the time (therefore what was my incentive to sell). Glad I held onto them. A 33.6% annual return over the last two years."
"I am still here have faith in a break out. ,Div is still good. Forget the shorts stay long"
Hopefully the price of JCI will go over $40 by the end of 2017.
This is the best most resilient stock ive never invested in.
"August 31, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Johnson Controls, the global leader for smart, healthy and sustainable buildings, today announced that Sensormatic Solutions, its leading global retail solutions portfolio, is streamlining its store shrink visibility offering globally to combat recent increases in shoplifting, internal theft and organized crime across retail enterprises.This new offering combines RFID-enabled detection systems and Electronic Product Code (EPC) item-level data with Sensormatic IQ. Together these systems unify diverse data and insights through a new intelligent operating platform to drive improved shopper experiences and retail outcomes.In-store shopping is recovering with increased consumer confidence1, but according to the U.S. Department of Labor, there are 965,000 open retail jobs, creating a challenging environment for retailers that makes theft and fraud easier.""Sensormatic Solutions’ new offering helps retailers address the record levels of shrink and fraud, as they face a perfect storm of increased foot traffic and a labor shortage, along with continuing economic challenges and the anonymity of face coverings,"" said Craig Szklany, Sensormatic Solutions VP of global solutions management & marketing.As consumer expectations change and shoppers become more accustomed to the accessibility of online shopping and fulfilment options like buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS), retailers can successfully navigate increasing in-store traffic by having the right merchandise in the right place at the right time offering unified commerce across all channels.With inventory and shopper behavior insights from Sensormatic IQ helping retailers create positive interactions with consumers, they can now understand what, when and how specific items go missing in real-time with integrated shrink visibility offerings. These actionable insights provide a new perspective of loss events across the enterprise and allow retailers to target shrink mitigation efforts more precisely while still delivering a frictionless experience for shoppers."
Why is it down 24% AH???
"Seriously, did someone at the WSJ press the wrong button? This Alex ""news"" happened 2 years ago. I guess they couldn't find any other bad news on JCI so the best they could do was bring something up that happened 2 years ago on someone that doesn't even work for the company any more."
72 would be nice
I think Tyco JCI was a very good merger. it should start to uptick from here on.
"Even with Credit Suisse and Oppenheimer pumping the stock today, the price just languishes, probably the worst run company in Ireland/America. Having worked here in the 2000's when the company was three business units and seeing where it is now, makes me glad I sold all of my stock when I left the company."
"Use of sale proceeds on deal closed today--$3.4B debt reduction, or a bit more than 25% and buying $8+B of shares seems meaningful. Apparently this has been known, but new to me. Plus a bit more added to the total today."
