"good entry point is around 2$ per share, no money coming in, stock is up because of the tooth fairy"
Just opened a position here. Great opportunity at this level. Thank you.
whats a good buy point here? 14? 15?
"Stocks are strange. STOR survives the day onslaught (only green ticker on my long list), but then declines 3% AH... what gives?!?"
WHY TANKING ?
why STOR drop almost 7 percent in the last one month? even today all Reits are doing ok
i love this stock. people love fishing people love there pets and people need to eat and people need furniture and all the leases are locked in with rent increases and a growing dividend
Dividend increase announcement should happen any day now if past years are guide.
Chris volk wrote an article on seeking alpha recently for those interested
Looks like i picked a good time buying in yesterday
"Just added my first REIT to my portfolio, 1200 shares, will add 500 every 5% increase."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starwood-property-trust-stwd-surpasses-113011596.html
What a great stock. I paid $23 sh for it once buffet announced they started a position and glad I didn't miss this one. The dividend still looks attractive after the run up
When is a good entry point for this?
Added at $17.90
wth most reits r up today
but why??? can someone explain me why this is so much down after rates cuts? should 't it be the oppsite?
If you didnt buy today pls dont buy when its 29
"i had a feeling that stor was going to drop and was able to pick up some more shares...STOR holding up well, this one is a keeper for life"
If you want a reliable Dividend stock that pays even in the hardest times and is 25% discounted right now then buy AT&T
Late to the party but seems an interesting entry point
where is the tenant list for STOR? I cojuldn't find on their website
"Finally back in $31.97. Regret selling my original position at $29.26 but I was expecting a large dip after the election that never really materialized. $STOR is a fantastic company with one of the most unique REIT business models I’ve ever seen. Long and strong with these guys, the div is just an added bonus. GLTA"
If youre looking long term great opportunities to add to your portfolio are showing face
BlackRock reported an increase of 70% in their holdings. They now hold 10% of STOR.
Good earnings. I'm not surprised at all. Who would be. Resilient and only growing
Locked in a 4% Dividend with this treasure chest today
Today portfolio update from Store capital: 64% rent received for April (usually 100%). About 90% of the rent not received (33% for the whole portfolio) asked for deferrals. Not looking great but should be temporary.
Long and strong on STOR. Low key might be one of the best REITs in North America. Business model is unmatched. Waiting for a larger dip to increase my position
Stock should bounce back from recent dip. Good buy point
Josh Brown CNBC still loves stock. Continues to reinvest distributions. along term holding for him
Store capital corp. to report third-quarter financial results on November 4. before the market opens.
9% pre market
The fact that they raised their dividend by almost 7% is a really strong statement. STORE is a force to be reaconed with.The earnings will only continue to snowball into the future. Glad I bought into this last year.Avg 31.5 with 86 shares. Not a lot but I keep adding on the dips.Have a great weekend!
"wow, definitely beat my expectations!"
"STORE Capital Corporation (STOR), an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, announced today that it has issued an aggregate of $508 million of long-term fixed-rate notes designated as STORE Master Funding Net Lease Mortgage Notes, Series 2019-1. Of the issued amount, $321.9 million represents new incremental term borrowings, with the remainder applied to prepay two prior Master Funding note classes. This is the ninth note issuance under STORE’s Master Funding debt program, its proprietary structured debt financing vehicle. The notes were issued in four classes in a private placement to premier institutional buyers. This is a new and regular debt issuance - the kind that companies take on to acquire additional properties. Its not dilutive to share price, or at least shouldn't be unless I am missing something. Otherwise, I consider this a buying opportunity. RSI is quite low (<5) so this stock is significantly oversold at this price."
When do we see $40+? Let's go!
"Q1 earnings:In thousands-Net income $54,960-FFO $108,147-eps 0.21 (missed by 0.01)Fairly okay ER, still bullish, long live STORE!"
Still a buy here? What say you?
New position at $15.95. Looking to added more. Solid Financials!
"been looking at store since shut down,should I buy now or wait for earnings"
"one of the Directors bought 10,000 shares on 12/12/19 at $37.491 which was an increase of 16% of his holdings"
They need to sue deadbeat tenants. $SPG is taking tenants to court. $STOR is giving the milk and the cow away.
where is the bottom here?
"Note that this is a temporary issue for companies with strong balance sheets. The rents are not cancelled, some are just deferred.During a regular bull market, investors earn steady 8%-12% returns per year. Most stocks are trading at close to fair value and they deliver fair returns.However, when prices start to materially deviate from fair value, that's when enormous returns can be generated. As an example, coming out of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, REITs nearly tripled in value in just 2 years"
"Any reason for the sudden lower closing yesterday and the sharp decline pre market today? ER seemed very good to me, so am I missing something?"
Buy this now so when it goes back to 30+ you can keep holding forever or sell and take some profit
"Still no dividend increase, another payout of 0.36$ a share. Will be payed out on the 15th of july.Ex div. date is the 30th of june"
"I been trying to get 1,000 shares for a few months. Hope buffet does not kill my average cost. 400 shares to go. It’s a good confidence booost nevertheless."
26.29 average for long term. Best believe I'll keep adding
Josh Brown was hyping STOR today at end of CNBC Halftime Report. It was his Final Trade.
Heard Buffy bought more. Good sign. He sees this getting back to the 40s
Long term no brainer
90% Dec collections. Nice!
91% rent collections. I hoped a little higher but it’s not bad. This autumn when most people will be vaccinated this stock will perform great. They have a rock solid balance sheet and are the perfect example of a dividend compounder for the next decade.
"Any information about % rents this month? When is earnings date for q3? I have 40 shares, but I am kinda afraid of second wave"
I like it. they have a great team. And there's not 1 Hong the online companys can take from them
so much value here
https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4371726-case-for-store
Josh brown on CNBC talking stor 
I did a bad thing. I sold Stor at 31.6 thinking there would be CrazyTown sell off by 10%. This stock has been a dear friend to my portfolio- but I cheated myself for a fast hit. Had to try...but know I owe tax.
best REIT. thing is going to go back up
STORE Capital is up 9.20% to 29.79
STOR down 10 % below 52 high. Dropped below 50 day and 200 day average. Initiated a position and will add on the way down. Buffet bought in at $20 I believe ??
"Once they announce the divvy is secured, this baby will rocket"
Buffett must be buying.
They should announce that the divvy is fine. Congrats to all who bought under $20. And even now it is still a good deal
"I consider this a value stock and investors will likely swap into more value thru the end of the year. Looking at the holistic picture - where else can you put your money? very few options...Value stocks are at the top. Plus, the fed has your back."
Again test 20 this week ?
Another month of 90% collections. Staying strong during the pandemic
One of the best investments i have ever made. Hopefully this will surpass 40 in the future. Just solid.
Highly encourage everyone to listen to webcast
+ 7% dividend
does anyone know why it's going down so fast?

Buffet stock
she's going slow and steady. And making sure she's solid all around
Getting close to my range to add more to my current position.
Atta boy Josh Brown. Nice pump on CNBC
75% of stores in portfolio are open. No cut in 8% dividend. No brainer BUY!!!
With now almost all states reopening this stock is gonna fly very soon if not tomorrow..
for this 4% pay out no good
"Knew this was a winner. How to maintain wealth, own STOR!"
Upped my position yesterday. Now my second biggest holding. Love this stock. I would almost bet fundamentals will drive the price to double in the next 5-7 years
Another great day to us longs! One of my favorite stocks along with $EPRT. Only the beginning here.
Solid dividend play.
Hi all. Share holder here from the UK. Does anyone have any insight into 1. Why the stock has been quite weak since the start of the year and 2. Whats bidens stance on REITs to give the stock price a reason to buy.
"Solids results, not sure why anyone would be selling?"
"$STOR, down now ~$1.50 from high, are people selling, taking profits or has something broke?"
"Store Closures and Retailers’ Bankruptcies Continue to Thwart Demand: The retail real estate market has been adversely impacted in recent years, as e-commerce is gaining market share from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, in turn, compelling retailers to reconsider their physical footprint and focus more on investing in online platforms. Mall traffic continues to suffer and retailers that are not being able to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. This has raised concerns over the fate of cash flows of physical stores and landlords as the trend is considerably curtailing demand for retail real estate space and any recovery is unlikely in the near term. These will also continue to lead to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions."
Very opportune day to pickup some more $STOR. One of the best REIT models on the planet. Easily going to get back to $40 and beyond
"I’m looking at taking a long term position. Any thoughts about a good entry point? I’m thinking 21.50, to get a 6.5% yield."
My average price is $30 wonder if we can see that again any time soon
Great reit to own but STOR isn’t a good value yet. It had a long run higher and I wouldn’t touch it at least until the dividend hits 4%+ and we’re at $34-35 or better. Just not worth it on the risk reward scale.
"Just a small fish, but listened to the call the other day and I will be buying a few shares everyday to increase my position"
rental business will booming again when covid is ended this summer. load up.
"Dividend prediction this week. STOR pays 50% dividend in cash and 50% in stock. Preserves dividend, preserves cash. Will be restored to full in 2 quarters"
Support at 35.55 on the weekly chart against the 40 day average. Trend line has held since April 2018. Good spot to add or start a position. Further support on the daily chart at 35.33
wild ride from hi to low
This REIT is built differently... Visit their website for a tutorial on how STOR does things differently allowing them 3 revenue sources while most REITs only have two.
Just bought into STORE. This may be the only REIT I can understand by reading the CEOs letters. Christopher H. Volk. Interested investors should give them a read.
Anything under $30 is a buy.. great long term stock.
No weak hands here. Holding long and strong.
ouch. but good buying opportunity!!
Glad I got in at $14.50
Wells Fargo analyst Todd Stender upgrades STORE Capital (NYSE:STOR) from Equal-Weight to Overweight.
Below 30 a good buy??
wow never thought we'd be down for the year
"Will they raise their dividend? if they do, stock, goes higher"
Just got in 55 shares
Pete najarian bought today because buffet has lg holding

When inflation is realized by the right departments in the economy this stock price is going up. I see big bucks coming to buy for safety. Either way I’m very long this stock with drips.
"This may jump again tomorrow, the PPP bill that passed today allows for a greater percentage of proceeds to pay for rent, which will directly affect this company. Yeehaa, thank god I got in below $20"
"great business and stock. That said, no idea how this business is doing so well in the pandemic"
Dividend raised 6.9%.
I see this as a good turn around long term play with a good moat. Bought a 100 shares at $23.40 cost basis a while back. Gonna let the position DRIP and forget about it.
Probably one of the best stocks you can buy now along with $STOR . Thank me later
no increase in div yet this year
Are inflation fears (rising bond yields) weighing on STOR? When do we head to $40? LFG!
"A conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m.Scottsdale, Arizona Time, to discuss May rent collections and answer questions: Live conference call: 855-656-0920 (domestic) or 412-542-4168 (international) Conference call replay available through June 10, 2020: 877-344-7529 (domestic) or 412-317-0088 (international) Replay access code: 10144345"
told you they had a good team. just because I look vanilla lol
"Brad Thomas says this stock has a ""secret sauce""Does that make you feel like a ""sleeping beauty"" ?"
"Nice rebound quarter. Exceptionally well managed company. Unique business model with experienced management, primary reason Warren Buffet owns 10% and State Street another 10%. 3Q 2020 AFFO of $0.46 per share rebounded from Covid impacted 2Q AFFO of $0.44 per share. This should continue to gradually improve sequentially over the next 2-3 quarters, eventually surpassing the previous quarterly AFFO high of $0.51 per share in 4Q2019. 2021 results will reflect completion of post-Covid transition with company resuming 8%+ annual asset/AFFO growth plus 4-5% dividend yield for a total shareholder return of 12-13% in 2022 and beyond. Based on (conservatively) estimated AFFO per share of $2.02 in 2021 and $2.18 in 2022 and dividend per share of $1.46 and $1.50 in calendar 2021 and 2022, stock should appreciate (+25-30%) to mid-30's by spring-summer 2021 and (+35-40%) to high 30's by year-end 2021 (based on its post-Covid resumption enabling its dividend yield to decline to 4% from its current 5% plus). STOR is a high quality (yield plus internal growth oriented) investment for long-term investors."
Dividend cut. From call today I would expect a temporary 50% dividend cut. While that sounds unwelcome it is better than using debt to pay dividend and demonstrates long term financial planning
love stor and main! definitely my top REITs
Someone bought 117K @ $17.04 AHhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/stor/after-hours

"The traders/gamblers/Robinhooders/speculators/millineals who are driving the markets these days have not invested through a full cycle yet. In fact very few people have because this current cycle of growth investing at all costs has been so long. The art of buying quality stable companies has faded. And now that the pandemic has distorted the world (for the short term) the focus has increased on the growth companies. Most value companies like Banks and REITs were out of favor to begin with because they aren't the tech darlings, but now they are doubly shunned because they are more affected by the shut downs. The thing being missed is the good ones are set to withstand the slow downs. The slow down won't last forever. These stocks have sold off 30 to 40% more than discounting the current bad news, but in no way reflective of their normalized earnings power. So the real opportunties in the market today are the stocks most hated. BXP, FRT, UDR and STOR in the REIT sector and also other value names like, BAC, GM, CVS, KO, T and TJX. There is just a huge opportunity in this market and all the money is crowded into one part where the risk is high. The opportunity feels like it did in 2000. It felt horrible. All the darlings were screaming upwards and the old value plays were ignored. It did reverse and when it did no one saw it coming. Value had its day."
why is it down so much?
"nice jump today, wonder if we push and stay past 31 now"
good sign when ppl buying thousands of shares @ 20 AH!!
Looks like a buying opportunity!
I own this. I like this. This is going to break 40 in the near-term.
Divvy might not be completely safe in the coming quarters but still solid.
STOR Capital moving to MidCap 400 to replace Domino's Pizza
Volk still very much involved. Fedewa has been there since day 1 and with a similar vision. I'd stay confident. Hold long
This was my most consistent stock but sold at start of pandemic. Is nobody worried about second wave implications to this business? seems like its exposed big time.
From the conference call I gleaned that a dividend increase is coming. STOR is one of my core holdings and I havebeen pleased with the rise in share price along with the dividend increases.
The market must be concluding that tenants will have no problem paying rent. Imagine if this was an up day. Up another 10% for sure.
REITs will be the first to recoup the losses once we balance out.
BUY BUY BUY
"Thinking about adding more, my only hesitation is that my current cost basis is under $20"
WHEW - another 5 star quarter!
Added today just under $36
Hey everyone have I done a good job picking up this stock my purchase price was about 28.98 so sitting in some decent gains please be kind as I am only eleven
I thought this is a safe REIT . I guess nothing is safe
Money in the bank. Easy decision for a long term investor
Some weak hands today. Selling isn't an option here. I'm holding very long and strong. STOR is just getting started. Still relatively new
Nice shareholder letter. This is a stock you don’t have to worry about. Gonna make this a decent portion of my HSA
A little too pricey to add rn. I'm looking for 30 or below. Great for your long term portfolio
Tomorrow Feds will announce long term low interest rates and will let inflation go up above 2% which should boost all REITs
"short term bearish, long bullish. Just wait on it!"
big buy wow
What I just read is that this REIT is the only REIT owned by Berkshire Hathaway.
"I bought STOR this week for the first time, below 20 and think it should work out well, I've heard Warren owns a lot of shares in Berk. Hathaway, however in the recent 2019 annual report I do not see STOR being a holding. Page A-1 of annual report shows their holdings."
Whats going on with STOR today? up 25%!?!?
Analyst CNBCLove and bought Store today!
Anyone know where we might find a listing of their real estate assets?
Finally over 20
Now way they cutting the divvy now. This is headed back to the 30s.
Dividend declaration is a good sign. When they have to declare the next one they should be in a even better position so I doubt the dividend is cut during covid-19.
This constantly runs out of steam holding 20. Will be a great sign if it can close > 20 today.
Wish I had put 100k in when it hit $14.. woulda had a good 100% return plus 10k a year coming in.. unfortunate. Still undervalued imo.
Added to my position today. Thank you
"Warren Buffet went short on STORHe expects bankruptcy. All the best, Brad."
Anyone think that something about the earnings might have leaked?
STORE Capital is up 5.11% to 31.29
"The bet here is, do you think the federal government will act to stop a huge amount of small businesses from going belly up. I'm holding because I believe the answer will be 'yes' and STOR will come out the other side in tact. It's going to take a year or two for full recovery."
I think STORE has had problems marketing itself. The CEO himself describes the company as more so a financial services company as apposed to a real estate company. The societal value here is that the business model is designed to lower the cost of capital and provide opportunities for small and medium sized businesses that otherwise would not be available. These types of businesses are the engine of economic growth and employment.
"Warren bought this at 20.25 in 2017, if you buy now, you can have even a cheaper price than he did"
Strong buy
im long STOR but can someone please explain to me why the eps for the year 2020 outlook is expected to be lower than this years . thank you
Great investment. Great time to get in around this range.
whats going on with the stock price?
STOR is currently priced at just half of where it was prior to the covid crisis. The 6.5% dividend yield is expected to remain sustainable and the shares have 80% upside as they return to recent highs.
That divy raise is too sweet
"Stor has exposure to to shut down businesses as theaters, gyms, child care, and restaurants. I still expect collections to hover around 85 % to 90%. The portfolio is diversified. Staying long and ready to buy more."
What happened?
thoughts on the earnings call ?
"REIT lovers, how about $STOR in comparison to $STWD ? just FYI that Warren Buffet owns shares from $STOR, but I think $STWD is good too, thought ?"
whats with the reits getting beat up ?
new investors should buy on ex dividend. great price to get in
I made a video about STORE Capital Corporation ($STOR)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SiiaJmaZAgHow long it will take to recover back to 40$?
CEO just went on CNBC. I like the way he leads from out front. He's not afraid. He didn't give away too much in terms of who did or didn't pay rent which was due on April 1st but he did seem comfortable. He may be a little more forthcoming on April 17th during the scheduled conference call.
buying!
What’s going on with STOR this week?
nice quarter. a great buy.
Tomorrow will be the follow-up call. Looking forward to great news.
"I own another Canadian reit TNT. I’m comparison, their earnings report is a lot better than STOR. I’m bearish on STOR short term earnings, 36% tenants did not pay rent in April. Most will defer rent until winter. That will decrease FFO and thus dividend. They own 60% service tenants which include restaurants. I anticipate some will file bankruptcy."
first time buyer today. I have been waiting for a dip.
Check out (http://Multistockalerts.com). They just mentioned STOR in the daily newsletter.
STOR is ok yielding about 4 percent but if you want a higher yielding REIT that has consistently raised it's dividend check out GLPI currently pays about 7.5% almost double STOR's. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/GLPI/dividend/

is the market anticipating a bad earnings report?
Nice drop. Will ad more
Is this an interest rate sensitive stock. Bought it on high recommendations but still learning what drives REITs and have this one because it seems to be best if breed.
Thinking of selling and using the proceeds to buy property. What are ya all thoughts?
I picked up some cheap shares here today and O realty.
"I hate to be demanding but I must say that those following STOR on this page are not doing a very good job compared to most of the other stocks I’m following. In the two days coming into earnings, STOR was rather weak on up market days. No one had the slightest clue. Someone asked if the market was anticipating a bad earnings report. Someone thought maybe it was the Pier 1 bankruptcy having a knock on effect. I listened to the back end of the earnings call yesterday and based on the analysts questions, it seemed apparent to me that the thing they were far more worried about than anything else was the news that Art Van Furniture Stores was having discussions about bankruptcy. This issue featured in most analyst questions. The CEO and CFO appeared to put the analysts at ease as to the impact which was limited. My guess is that this is the reason that the stock calmed down the next day and rose."
