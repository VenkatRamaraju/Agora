"Nice rebound quarter. Exceptionally well managed company. Unique business model with experienced management, primary reason Warren Buffet owns 10% and State Street another 10%. 3Q 2020 AFFO of $0.46 per share rebounded from Covid impacted 2Q AFFO of $0.44 per share. This should continue to gradually improve sequentially over the next 2-3 quarters, eventually surpassing the previous quarterly AFFO high of $0.51 per share in 4Q2019. 2021 results will reflect completion of post-Covid transition with company resuming 8%+ annual asset/AFFO growth plus 4-5% dividend yield for a total shareholder return of 12-13% in 2022 and beyond. Based on (conservatively) estimated AFFO per share of $2.02 in 2021 and $2.18 in 2022 and dividend per share of $1.46 and $1.50 in calendar 2021 and 2022, stock should appreciate (+25-30%) to mid-30's by spring-summer 2021 and (+35-40%) to high 30's by year-end 2021 (based on its post-Covid resumption enabling its dividend yield to decline to 4% from its current 5% plus). STOR is a high quality (yield plus internal growth oriented) investment for long-term investors."
STOR is currently priced at just half of where it was prior to the covid crisis. The 6.5% dividend yield is expected to remain sustainable and the shares have 80% upside as they return to recent highs.
should have been out and dumped all into SPG
I think STORE has had problems marketing itself. The CEO himself describes the company as more so a financial services company as apposed to a real estate company. The societal value here is that the business model is designed to lower the cost of capital and provide opportunities for small and medium sized businesses that otherwise would not be available. These types of businesses are the engine of economic growth and employment.
That divy raise is too sweet
new investors should buy on ex dividend. great price to get in
Dividend raised 6.9%.
whats with the reits getting beat up ?
"Note that this is a temporary issue for companies with strong balance sheets. The rents are not cancelled, some are just deferred.During a regular bull market, investors earn steady 8%-12% returns per year. Most stocks are trading at close to fair value and they deliver fair returns.However, when prices start to materially deviate from fair value, that's when enormous returns can be generated. As an example, coming out of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, REITs nearly tripled in value in just 2 years"
Any thoughts on the 3q ER? The analysts seem to think EPS will be 0.25c. I hope they are right.
Store capital corp. to report third-quarter financial results on November 4. before the market opens.
One of the best investments i have ever made. Hopefully this will surpass 40 in the future. Just solid.
"Just added my first REIT to my portfolio, 1200 shares, will add 500 every 5% increase."
"The traders/gamblers/Robinhooders/speculators/millineals who are driving the markets these days have not invested through a full cycle yet. In fact very few people have because this current cycle of growth investing at all costs has been so long. The art of buying quality stable companies has faded. And now that the pandemic has distorted the world (for the short term) the focus has increased on the growth companies. Most value companies like Banks and REITs were out of favor to begin with because they aren't the tech darlings, but now they are doubly shunned because they are more affected by the shut downs. The thing being missed is the good ones are set to withstand the slow downs. The slow down won't last forever. These stocks have sold off 30 to 40% more than discounting the current bad news, but in no way reflective of their normalized earnings power. So the real opportunties in the market today are the stocks most hated. BXP, FRT, UDR and STOR in the REIT sector and also other value names like, BAC, GM, CVS, KO, T and TJX. There is just a huge opportunity in this market and all the money is crowded into one part where the risk is high. The opportunity feels like it did in 2000. It felt horrible. All the darlings were screaming upwards and the old value plays were ignored. It did reverse and when it did no one saw it coming. Value had its day."
Today portfolio update from Store capital: 64% rent received for April (usually 100%). About 90% of the rent not received (33% for the whole portfolio) asked for deferrals. Not looking great but should be temporary.
The fact that they raised their dividend by almost 7% is a really strong statement. STORE is a force to be reaconed with.The earnings will only continue to snowball into the future. Glad I bought into this last year.Avg 31.5 with 86 shares. Not a lot but I keep adding on the dips.Have a great weekend!
wow never thought we'd be down for the year
where is the bottom here?
ouch. but good buying opportunity!!
wth most reits r up today
