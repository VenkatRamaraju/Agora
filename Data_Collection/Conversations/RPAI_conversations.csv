"I am trapped in this miserable stock. If I sell I would lose over $60,000 but it is obvious this stock is never going to come up to the point that would pay me what I have in it which is $25."

Is there any change with the company that I'm not aware of?
"With a stock price going nowhere but slowly down, dividends that haven' changed in over five plus years, you think that a change at the top would be in order. It seems that only upper management salaries continues to rise substantially."

This stock has been in a holding pattern the last six years. Its not going anywhere. Its time for a shake-up for the top management. The market is going up a double digit increases and this stock remain a constant zero!
