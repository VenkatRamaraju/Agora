Looks like will test the 400 DMA around $77.50. Great company - selloff is overdone considering they kept the 2021 guidance. Will be buying soon...
I guess investor day didn’t go well today’
I was thinking the same thing SG! But the charts are hard to deny...especially if you believe the trend is your friend. Thus I jumped in. So far so good...If the charts any indication...should be in the 80's by L8 Sept-Oct! 
For a year stock has been suppressed by DOJ investigation. CEO has indicated these matters take time . Any ideas as to when this cloud will dissipate?
BAH is down -5.64% to 36.48

Go BAH! Exciting to see!
Booz Allen Hamilton Holding is up 5.09% to 84.66
Bought some today. It may have over corrected.
God what a dog this has become...
anybody on this board ?
Not good. Closed under $80. I hope this doesn’t go under $70 now. I’mAlmost out of funds lol
"Everyone step up, place your bets! I like the AH action so far. Best of luck to everyone tomorrow morning!"
Bargain basement price. Time to take advantage of the usual manipulation.
Huge government contract 200m+
"Only green stock in a bloodbath market! WOW!! Super strength here, and the company is insanely undervalued at these prices to boot!!"
"Such a strange price action. Slower and drifting more than anytime in last several years. No change from a year ago. Lots of real big contract wins recently, next ER could be a catalyst up."
I added at $69. Didn't think i would get another buying opportunity like this.
Just bought another 100 shares. Punished stock good long investment.
BAH reached a new 52 Week High at 40.85
"nice move today!more proof that patient accumulation of undervalued names always pays off. keep your eye on fundamentals, ignore manias like TSLA, keep a longterm mindset and don't let wall street shake you out of your positions. you will do well in the end no matter what, unlike the tulip bulb chasers of TSLA who will lose their entire investment in a month when the market crashes."
added some more. Its now my top holding. Hope this turns around soon lol
$BAH will engage in a conversation on its growth strategy and multi-year outlook for financial performance and capital deployment.

Yikes! This lost 20% awfully quick on not bad earnings.
Think BAH will see a chunk of the next defense bill
This stock has been on fire inspite of all controversies over the years. All due to solid earnings growth
Great earnings. Very happy.
"How much more juice is left in BAH? Want to buy this as a long-term holding due to their grip on digital transformation in the government space along with cyber security. Shares look expensive given their steep rise on beat and raises, so a correction would certainly be welcome here.."
"Not sure if BAH is just tracking with the market or not, but the next earnings is scheduled for early November. We lost all the gains from the last ER so this could be a jump opportunity."
With an 8 billion backlog buy buy buy
Safest stock for the long run. Can't go wrong.
If BAH breach $ 66 I feel there will be a huge buying. Good company for long term
BAH reached a new All Time High at 41.06
Added under $81 today
It looks like a bottom to me. May the slow march to 90 begin!
"Oh, you make the data that allows our missiles to pick off incomming missles and lasers that can move way faster than supersonic— I think this company is RELEVANT in 2020"
Booz Allen Hamilton reached an all time high at 92.17
"How many days in a row can this turd drop? I got in a couple of weeks ago at $85, and I don't think it's seen one up day since I bought."
Can we get green today? Is that too much to ask lol
