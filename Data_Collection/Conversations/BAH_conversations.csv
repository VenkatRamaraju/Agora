For a year stock has been suppressed by DOJ investigation. CEO has indicated these matters take time . Any ideas as to when this cloud will dissipate?
BAH reached a new All Time High at 52.31
If BAH breach $ 66 I feel there will be a huge buying. Good company for long term
"How many days in a row can this turd drop? I got in a couple of weeks ago at $85, and I don't think it's seen one up day since I bought."
God what a dog this has become...
It looks like a bottom to me. May the slow march to 90 begin!
I was thinking the same thing SG! But the charts are hard to deny...especially if you believe the trend is your friend. Thus I jumped in. So far so good...If the charts any indication...should be in the 80's by L8 Sept-Oct!

"Not sure if BAH is just tracking with the market or not, but the next earnings is scheduled for early November. We lost all the gains from the last ER so this could be a jump opportunity."

Been keeping an eye on this stock for awhile but not sure when to get in
"This is probably a violation of the False Claims Act. Disclosure was probably required because BAH received a subpoena for records.Questions1. How did this investigation start? Qui Tam (Whistleblower), DCAA Form 2000 (referral to DoD investigative agencies of suspicious , irregular conduct found during an audit) or an investigation started by DCIS/NCIS/AFOSI (based on a tip or lead)2. Is there a criminal investigation? Has the criminal division of the responsible USAO opened a grand jury?3. Has BAH completed its internal investigation, including any estimated dollar damage?4. What action, if any, will DCMAO take to suspend BAH from receiving new contract awards? If DCMAO suspends BAH right now and the investigation takes ""awhile,"" then BAH will have a revenue problem in the next few quarters (or until this issue is resolved.Issues1. If this is a civil False Claims Case only, then the"

"Issues (continued)1. If this is a civil case only, then it could take many months to resolve. 2. If criminal, then BAH will try to resolve this quickly, possibly leveraging a larger damage payment in lieu of a deferred prosecution referral.3. If BAH fights, then prepare for a trial (a long time from now) and possible suspension by DCMAO before trial.4. There are probably mischarging issues, which means lots of 302s."

"How much more juice is left in BAH? Want to buy this as a long-term holding due to their grip on digital transformation in the government space along with cyber security. Shares look expensive given their steep rise on beat and raises, so a correction would certainly be welcome here.."

"Such a strange price action. Slower and drifting more than anytime in last several years. No change from a year ago. Lots of real big contract wins recently, next ER could be a catalyst up."
Can we get green today? Is that too much to ask lol
"nice move today!more proof that patient accumulation of undervalued names always pays off. keep your eye on fundamentals, ignore manias like TSLA, keep a longterm mindset and don't let wall street shake you out of your positions. you will do well in the end no matter what, unlike the tulip bulb chasers of TSLA who will lose their entire investment in a month when the market crashes."
