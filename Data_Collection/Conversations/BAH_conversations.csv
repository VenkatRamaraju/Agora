"Such a strange price action. Slower and drifting more than anytime in last several years. No change from a year ago. Lots of real big contract wins recently, next ER could be a catalyst up."
"Only green stock in a bloodbath market! WOW!! Super strength here, and the company is insanely undervalued at these prices to boot!!"
Great earnings. Very happy.
Boozers keep getting hosed!
I was thinking the same thing SG! But the charts are hard to deny...especially if you believe the trend is your friend. Thus I jumped in. So far so good...If the charts any indication...should be in the 80's by L8 Sept-Oct!

"How much more juice is left in BAH? Want to buy this as a long-term holding due to their grip on digital transformation in the government space along with cyber security. Shares look expensive given their steep rise on beat and raises, so a correction would certainly be welcome here.."

"This is probably a violation of the False Claims Act. Disclosure was probably required because BAH received a subpoena for records.Questions1. How did this investigation start? Qui Tam (Whistleblower), DCAA Form 2000 (referral to DoD investigative agencies of suspicious , irregular conduct found during an audit) or an investigation started by DCIS/NCIS/AFOSI (based on a tip or lead)2. Is there a criminal investigation? Has the criminal division of the responsible USAO opened a grand jury?3. Has BAH completed its internal investigation, including any estimated dollar damage?4. What action, if any, will DCMAO take to suspend BAH from receiving new contract awards? If DCMAO suspends BAH right now and the investigation takes ""awhile,"" then BAH will have a revenue problem in the next few quarters (or until this issue is resolved.Issues1. If this is a civil False Claims Case only, then the"

"Issues (continued)1. If this is a civil case only, then it could take many months to resolve. 2. If criminal, then BAH will try to resolve this quickly, possibly leveraging a larger damage payment in lieu of a deferred prosecution referral.3. If BAH fights, then prepare for a trial (a long time from now) and possible suspension by DCMAO before trial.4. There are probably mischarging issues, which means lots of 302s."
