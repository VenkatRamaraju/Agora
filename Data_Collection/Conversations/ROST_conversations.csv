Not an overreaction at all. All the ROST Stores in my area are dead and the lack of merchandise is horrible. Every time I go in the shelves are empty and its slim pickings. Stock will be under $70 soon. TJX and BURL are the clear winners. Way better merchandise.the company retained a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018 as it continues to anticipate challenges from strong multi-year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape.
"ROST easily once again continue beating estimate on next quarters when all schools are opening and as soon as more vaccine rollouts ...plus booster shots get underway by this September...so more and more people, students are going out on ROSS STORES ...great benefits next quarters...if not saying huge profits with top beat in the quarter ahead this winter....BUY...BUY...BUY...MORE"
Stores closed and no online sells. This is going a lot lower
"Dropping like rock.. Just below $118.00 now. Not a good sign even after successful Q2 earning, just like Trade Desk."
just bought 1500 ROST at $119.00
Ross Stores is down 5.04% to 120.20
This stock should go lower even though their a great company because they will be closed for many months.Trading at a premium to all other clothing companies
Big Boys plaing the market. ROST will be green soon! Buy and make a quick $$$
how are they going to sell anything online? they have all reject pics. fro. brand names and can not list it individually. if everything is moving towards online commerce they will be in trouble soon
"Looks like ROST will open around $122. But I think there is an excellent chance we get a sell-off in the first 20 minutes that dips us to under $120. I expect lots of sellers all day long on ROST, with limited buying interest."
Any predictions for after hours? 114 seems possible...
Expect ROST 100 breakout very soon. Labor Day shopping spree is building margin by now. Pretty sure ROST already passed its EPS and revenues on this week in advance.
"Ross Stores Reports Q2 Earnings BeatBrett Hershman , Benzinga Staff Writer FOLLOW August 22, 2019 4:10pm 1 min read CommentsRoss Stores, Inc. ROST 1.61% reported a second-quarter earnings beat after Thursday's closing bell.Earnings came in at $1.14, beating estimates by 2 cents. Sales came in at $3.98 billion, beating estimates by $20 million.""We delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter,"" said CEO Barbara Rentler. ""While our Ladies business continued to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the period. Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected, mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.2 million and 6.6 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate price of $320 million in the quarter and $640 million year-to-date. As planned, we expect to buy back a total of $1.275 billion in common stock during fiscal 2019.""HighlightsSales grew 6% year-over-yearComps up 3%"
"Well well, here we are in the early pre-market and ROST is trading at $-121. Will she fall into the $110's before market open and stay there for the entire day?? Maybe. Could easily happen. I hope so. :-) The bottom line is:1: ROST specifically provided very weak and uncertain forward Guidance.2: The stock was seriously over-valued before earnings release and remains seriously over-valued now.3: The entire stock market is poised to open lower today.4: It is Friday and nobody will want to get into a new position on a risky and downward trending stock, to hold over the weekend, with broad economic worries and a severe geo-political crises underway. So, I think odds are good that ROST opens the regular session under $120 and experiences a slow but relentless decline throughout the day, ending -$115.00. Oh, and I have already chosen my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, it is going to be MSGE. I just hope I can get in later today at a decently high price. I'm worried this one might just collapse today, BEFORE earnings release... We shall see how things develop. Good Luck folks!"
"Up and Up the way it goes after e/r yesterday...and it should like last e/r on last May 20, 2021...BUY...BUY...BUY more while I can..."
still cheap with its growth

"Do they let you try on clothes in the store fitting rooms yet? I've been in a few of the stores in the last 1+ years and the fitting rooms are closed, so I just turn around and walk out. Used to like shopping there."
"Ross Stores (ROST) Surpasses Q2 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesZacks Equity ResearchThu, August 19, 2021, 2:15 PMIn this article:ROST+2.04%Ross Stores (ROST) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 per share. This compares to loss of $0.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.34, delivering a surprise of 48.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times."
Each quarter this ceo sandbags her forecast to manage expectations and then hits it over the wall. if you play it right it is a no-brainer buy opportunity.
What happening to discount retailers??? Any ideas

IT WILL BEAT EARNINGS. BUT WILL BE DOWN BIG TIME. ALMOST 52 WEEK HIGH...
does it reach 74?
Based on TJX and store closures for past quarter not unexpected. Probably another drop to mid 80's then gradual increase. Good buy points for a longer term play.

When is ROST expected to resume it's dividend payouts?
I think ROST should buy JCP and turn all viable locations into Super Ross Stores.

Sols Short a lot of shares of ROST just a few minutes ago at $126.30. This is a Pure Earnings short sell. I am looking for ROST to sell off significantly in direct response to weak and disappointing earnings numbers.

Sales for the first half of 2021 rose 20% to $9.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 14%.Ms. Rentler further noted, ""Looking ahead, there remains much uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the positive external factors that benefited our first half results as well as the potential risks we may face from the spread of COVID variants and worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion. As a result, we are forecasting third quarter same store sales to be up 5% to 7% with earnings per share in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This guidance reflects our expectation for escalating freight and supply chain costs, and ongoing COVID-related operating expenses.""Ms. Rentler added, ""Based on first half results and our third quarter outlook, we are updating our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share forecast to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.38 on a comparable store sales gain of 10% to 11%."""

will jump at least 10-15 percent.

Fake dip just like NVDA AH. Loading up. Up 4-5% tomorrow.
"Ross Stores (ROST) reported 2010 Q1 results after the market closed on Thursday. While Q1 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic and mandatory shutdowns, we believe Ross' business model is well-situated to ride out the current crisis and likely take share from weaker retailers such as department stores and specialty retailers. More importantly, the company has continued to accumulate inventory including packaway items that will keep its store shelves full as stores are reopening. We think Ross and the off-price retailers are better-prepared to weather the current storm and grab additional market share from struggling sectors such as department stores."

"How is this still valued at the same price as 1 year ago? Every store is closed for months now, they have no e-commerce business. I haven’t even got started on how every retailer is now an off-price discounter. Why go to Ross when you can do direct to any e-commerce site and get huge discounts right now??? Why this continues to go up is a mystery."
"Nabeel, I will buy Rost on Monday and hold it until it goes up around 15 percent or so. Is that correct? Thx so much!"
HERE WE GO BABY! $105 by the end of next week!

"Once again, Barbara ""Sandbag"" Rentler spoils a great day by lying about 1-2% comp stores to keep the pressure off her and her team. I am really getting tired of these so-called ""guidance"" events. Just execute, let the numbers fall where they may and keep your guidance to yourself!"

"ROST is repeatedly losing the $120.00 level. No serious buying interest on this Bloated Baby, even when it is down 5%+ on the day. There is every reason to think this will stay weak and trend down for the remainder of the day. Happy to stay Short for now, but will of course Cover before market close today and immediately jump into my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, which will be MSGE."
what was the point of Rost price went up to $115 range yesterday around 4pm and then now it's sitting at $110 and below? but then on the other hand target price moved up and stayed up continuously. very strange Rost. some helpful advise from anyone out there
