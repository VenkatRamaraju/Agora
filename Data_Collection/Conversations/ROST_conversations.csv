"Ross Stores Tumbles as Discount Retailer Warns of Tariff ImpactTheStreet.com TheStreet.com•August 23, 2019"
Solid company long term will be fine- the under the radar off price retailer CTRN just blew out earnings
"Can anyone explain to me why ROST seems to move in the opposite direction of the market on so many days? On days where every other stock is up, it seems like ROST is flat or down, and on days like today, where the market is down, ROST is up 1%."
"No, I mean I will watch DLTR and wait for price to go down a bit."
"Supposed to be recession proof, Fidelity rates it a strong buy, trades ex dididend next week. I'll buy in Tue."
We will close $90 today....$10 soon
"The stock initially sold off in after-hours trading. That's why it 's temporarily down, however, it 'll up much higher tomorrow at pre-trading session / open hours...."
Ok here we go. Got big money on a fall.
Do we ever see a Zack report which is not #3?
Is ROST undervalued? This sort of setup suggests potential upside... Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from aw-esomeSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
Shorted @89. Most likely going down short term
GOING to open at 85$ tomorrow!
7th upgrade 131 wooow
an I glad I didnt play a strangle in this
What an over reaction!!!! This stock worths over $95 Solid report. All the institutions will buy tomorrow!
aftermarket speculation won't help once market opens. it's going down to 78
"ROST is down due to over reaction of investors to news. All these investors selling off ROSS, will be right back at the end of the week buying."
Should finish on GREEN today / by MONDAY next week ! Great undervalued price today.
Fake dip just like NVDA AH. Loading up. Up 4-5% tomorrow.
keep waiting for a bounce to get out of this thing. extremely overvalued. missed my chance a few days ago
ROST WILL BE MOVING FAST AS SOON ALL THE SHORTS COVER BEFORE TOO LATE TODAY....
Why are all the close out stores so picked over with barely any inventory?
I am bullish on this company. I believe that earnings will surpass estimates and we will have a higher high tomorrow. BUY BUY!
Ross will be $20 soon

"Ross Stores (ROST) reported 2010 Q1 results after the market closed on Thursday. While Q1 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic and mandatory shutdowns, we believe Ross' business model is well-situated to ride out the current crisis and likely take share from weaker retailers such as department stores and specialty retailers. More importantly, the company has continued to accumulate inventory including packaway items that will keep its store shelves full as stores are reopening. We think Ross and the off-price retailers are better-prepared to weather the current storm and grab additional market share from struggling sectors such as department stores."
how are they going to sell anything online? they have all reject pics. fro. brand names and can not list it individually. if everything is moving towards online commerce they will be in trouble soon
"Amazing company. Knows how to beat and raise street expectations. Glad I am holding this name currently, although trimming shares few weeks back was a mistake in hindsight."
ROST is up 8.08% to 80.79
What happening to discount retailers??? Any ideas

"Wouldn’t a good earnings report By TJX bode well for Ross and that should Have strong earnings tomorow , yet stick is down 5 percent any thoughts ?"

Stores are bare. Hardly any merchandise in the store near me. This has been an on going issue of late.
"Does not make sense on how Ross dropped heavily on good earnings. Yet, Gap brands dropped a few cents with terrible earnings."
Ross Stores shares are trading lower after the company issued Q3 EPS guidance below analyst estimates.
Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on ROST? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from aw-esomeSTOCKS.
"Unlike TJ Max, Ross knows how to make a profit. Even with 75% of their stores being forced to temperately close."
"Sell Short, we are heading to $20"
what happend?
over reaction. Buy down $5.
"Just remember that bad guidance leads to future earnings beat. Not great for the day trader, but good for investors."

If Macy’s closes where will ross get all those great leftover buys ?
Not an overreaction at all. All the ROST Stores in my area are dead and the lack of merchandise is horrible. Every time I go in the shelves are empty and its slim pickings. Stock will be under $70 soon. TJX and BURL are the clear winners. Way better merchandise.the company retained a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018 as it continues to anticipate challenges from strong multi-year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape.
What growth. I sold long ago.
"I don't know why i bother waiting for the release anymore, cut and paste this headline every quarter: Ross Stores stock falls after QX earnings beat, lower QX guidance. Last quarter it was down after hours, but opened even. Hope for the same result tomorrow!"

ROST is up 5.09% to 96.00
Their earnings are okay and stock buyback program is good. Why -4% AH?
I saw long line on Ross store in my area
ROST reached a new All Time High at 93.92
Why is it down 5%?
I didn’t think I could ever find a free service that was so valuable but it has finally happened. See for yourself at THESTOCKDORK (Google)
ROST reached an all time high at 121.34
it sounds like we have good news but the market is reacting negatively? Anyone got any ideas?
There was a huge line of people waiting to get in today. People walking out with at least two bags.
ROST is down 7.67% to $84.20
This is not unusual for the stock. Great buying opportunity if you’re interested
"How is this still valued at the same price as 1 year ago? Every store is closed for months now, they have no e-commerce business. I haven’t even got started on how every retailer is now an off-price discounter. Why go to Ross when you can do direct to any e-commerce site and get huge discounts right now??? Why this continues to go up is a mystery."

"Well well, here we are in the early pre-market and ROST is trading at $-121. Will she fall into the $110's before market open and stay there for the entire day?? Maybe. Could easily happen. I hope so. :-) The bottom line is:1: ROST specifically provided very weak and uncertain forward Guidance.2: The stock was seriously over-valued before earnings release and remains seriously over-valued now.3: The entire stock market is poised to open lower today.4: It is Friday and nobody will want to get into a new position on a risky and downward trending stock, to hold over the weekend, with broad economic worries and a severe geo-political crises underway. So, I think odds are good that ROST opens the regular session under $120 and experiences a slow but relentless decline throughout the day, ending -$115.00. Oh, and I have already chosen my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, it is going to be MSGE. I just hope I can get in later today at a decently high price. I'm worried this one might just collapse today, BEFORE earnings release... We shall see how things develop. Good Luck folks!"

Sales came in at $3.98 billion, beating estimates by $20 million.""We delivered respectable gains in both sales and earnings for the second quarter,"" said CEO Barbara Rentler. ""While our Ladies business continued to trail the chain, trends in this important area showed some improvement during the period. Operating margin of 13.7% was better than expected, mainly due to favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in the second half. During the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 3.2 million and 6.6 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate price of $320 million in the quarter and $640 million year-to-date.

As a result, we are forecasting third quarter same store sales to be up 5% to 7% with earnings per share in the range of $0.61 to $0.69.

Can you believe these companies that report great than give a terrible guidance number? Happening way too much. These CEO's need to go back to earnings call school!

"ROST is repeatedly losing the $120.00 level. No serious buying interest on this Bloated Baby, even when it is down 5%+ on the day. There is every reason to think this will stay weak and trend down for the remainder of the day.

Why does yahoo finance never talk about the fact that stock buy backs improve the earnings of the company. How come investors never realize stock buyback is only good for the company to cash out.
