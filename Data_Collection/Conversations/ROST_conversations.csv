"ROST is repeatedly losing the $120.00 level. No serious buying interest on this Bloated Baby, even when it is down 5%+ on the day. There is every reason to think this will stay weak and trend down for the remainder of the day. Happy to stay Short for now, but will of course Cover before market close today and immediately jump into my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, which will be MSGE."
Bought 16 shares of ROST in 1993 in an ira. This was Before the company paid a dividend on the shares.Today with splits and reinvested dividends those 16 shares are now 935 shares. ROST is definitely a Long term hold.

"Do they let you try on clothes in the store fitting rooms yet? I've been in a few of the stores in the last 1+ years and the fitting rooms are closed, so I just turn around and walk out. Used to like shopping there."
Stores are bare. Hardly any merchandise in the store near me. This has been an on going issue of late.
I wonder if this stock can get below $100? seems like the stores of late are empty as far as goods. I'm sure the supply chain issues will be an going concert until mid 2022.
"Weak Guidance is a killer in an earnings release. And that's what we have right here...Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROST) today reported earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021 grew 22% to $1.39 on net income of $494 million. This compares to $1.14 per share on net earnings of $413 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2019. Sales rose 21% to $4.8 billion, with comparable store sales up a robust 15%.For the six months ended July 31, 2021, earnings per share were $2.73 on net earnings of $971 million, up from $2.29 per share on net income of $834 million for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first half of 2021 rose 20% to $9.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 14%.Ms. Rentler further noted, ""Looking ahead, there remains much uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the positive external factors that benefited our first half results as well as the potential risks we may face from the spread of COVID variants and worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion. As a result, we are forecasting third quarter same store sales to be up 5% to 7% with earnings per share in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This guidance reflects our expectation for escalating freight and supply chain costs, and ongoing COVID-related operating expenses.""Ms. Rentler added, ""Based on first half results and our third quarter outlook, we are updating our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share forecast to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.38 on a comparable store sales gain of 10% to 11%."""

"Unprecedented incident in today's earning's announcement:In addition, our results were bolstered by a number of external factors, including ongoing government stimulus, increasing vaccination rates, and a diminishing COVID restriction.Executives not taking 100% credit for everything that goes good and blaming external factors for everything that goes bad.

Is Ross a good value play as inflation heats up and people seek discounts/deals?

"Some companies with a larger market cap than Affirm's $38B: Coca Cola $KO, Starbucks $SBUX, TJMaxx $TJX, Docusign $DOCU, Ross Stores $ROST. Affirm is scaling their volume by about 2 X per year without purchasing inventory or real estate or fulfillment centers. Own Quality."
"Well well, here we are in the early pre-market and ROST is trading at $-121. Will she fall into the $110's before market open and stay there for the entire day?? Maybe. Could easily happen. I hope so. :-) The bottom line is:1: ROST specifically provided very weak and uncertain forward Guidance.2: The stock was seriously over-valued before earnings release and remains seriously over-valued now.3: The entire stock market is poised to open lower today.4: It is Friday and nobody will want to get into a new position on a risky and downward trending stock, to hold over the weekend, with broad economic worries and a severe geo-political crises underway. So, I think odds are good that ROST opens the regular session under $120 and experiences a slow but relentless decline throughout the day, ending -$115.00. Oh, and I have already chosen my next Pure Earnings Short Sell, it is going to be MSGE. I just hope I can get in later today at a decently high price. I'm worried this one might just collapse today, BEFORE earnings release... We shall see how things develop. Good Luck folks!"
