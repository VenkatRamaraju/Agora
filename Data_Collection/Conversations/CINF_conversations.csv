Ideal short. Stretched valuation. And check out how short-selling funds have CINF in their sights.
"Covid-19 exposure will have no impact, How can one put specific language into a policy concerning a pandemic. Does not make sense."
Another solid quarter
"Yeah, the usual, bash the stock, downgrade it and in two weeks it's a strong buy lol"
I put in my buy for more stock in CINF. I have owned for at least 15 years when it was around $25 a share. have been very happy
CINF reached an all time high at 101.16
Looks like a decent buy here down $10 today
This stock is make low everyday ? I hold it and frustrated me everyday.
Don’t miss the train!!!
"At 83 it’s going to rise more, it’s still fair price overall"
Cincinnati Financial is up 4.92% to 95.17
"Can you say ROUGH WEEK for this stock. Hopefully up from here.If they declare a dividend, that would help settle things down a little."
"Bought 3rd lot this morning as this has dropped. Can’t see the fear. 1Q loss of $1.226B after $1.303B reduction in equities still held. That’s called “mark to market”. Dow at year-end closing somewhere between 28,414 to 28,675 depending on exact date they closed their books. End of Q1, Dow between 18,831 and 22,208, again depending on closing date. Could be almost 10,000 pt. Swing. Same effect will happen only in favor at 6/30 with Dow up. Right now at 24,557. That could be almost 6,000 pt difference between Q1 and Q2. Also, DWP is up 10% and current AY Combined is 91.5% vs 92.7% last year, meaning more volume at more profit. This is a long term play, not a flip. Hang in and it will pay big."
Any news from CINF?
CINF reached a 52 Week low at 72.01

What was that rocket drop all about?
"Yup, definitely an ugly day for the PPS, nice to know that all of us longs will be collecting rent via dividends while we wait for it to return to its upward trajectory. Think of it like a very high yield CD...this stock is like money in the bank."
Cinf should buy HIG. A marriage of ugly is often the best kind.

There are 2 insurance stocks worth owning. Cincinnati which may be the best independent agency company is US with broad portfolio of products. Second company to own is Progressive which still is ahead of the market with outstanding analytics.
CINF reached a 52 Week low at 77.14
Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 47.67
"Expect a big jump when 2Q results are released 7/27. Expectation is .67, but 3 out of last 4 Qtrs exceeded by average of 18%. DWP in Q1 was up 10%, and with insurance pricing increasing, probably up more, barring COVID adjustments for exposure base shrinkage. AY2020 loss ratio down over last year and with assets mostly recovering from 1Q markdowns, would not be surprised to see $1.00 or more EPS."
financials are headed lower. invesotors dont know how much toxic assets is in their books. they keep telling us financials are sound but price movement says diferent story. cinf is headed lower until some clarity established. only opportunity i see right now is in energy since energy has bottomed out. a company like oneok and EPD are rewarding investments at this level with life time of income

"Holly $%@@&$ WOW, Batman ! In a rising market and the absence of major casualty losses CINF shouldn't be doing this."
Imagine my shock when the stock rose over 3% in one day! Thanks to my DD and the folks on this board! Anyone have any 1 month and year price estimates? Thanks.
"This stock just up $14 after hour, does anyone know what’s going on here?"
When are we selling?
"Not many recent comments regarding CINF. It might be a great buy once it hits the 60's. Many utilities have better yields, but 3.5% on an insurance company sounds good, plus the dividend has plenty of room to grow, based on the earnings estimates. I am not sure that it can go much lower, so I will see what is happening on Monday."

Yahoo 'premier' service lowers the target price long after the lower target is already reached?

"Wow, I read the transcript, this question combined with the multiple event question on the tower was a head turner.Question - I'm sorry, so I understand, so is -- it covers all perils? Steven Justus Johnston, Cincinnati Financial Corporation - President, CEO & Director [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's generally a property-- it's a property catastrophe risk policy and they follow our fortunes, and we'd have a virus exclusion in there."
What happened?
Ii think the market peaked today. cinf will have to wait till earnings.

"Across all industry, guess which market segment does the most due diligence, has the deepest financial reserves, retains the most magna level lawyers, and is best equipped to ride out unforeseen events...insurance companies. Good luck shorts, you are literally betting against the house."
"Shorts are pushing price down. Would not be surprised if larger company begins to sniff. Management should be fired, to many chiefs not enough indians"
Nice day. Interest rates?
Haven’t seen a buying opportunity like this since BGS hit $11. I am backing the truck up!
Shares of several financial stocks are trading higher amid positive vaccine news. A return to more normal business operations could indicate more financing activity and higher interest rates.Benzinga
Dividend declared at same amount and this just will not go up. Should have run away a few days ago. Don't know when/if this will ever turn green. Still here though.

"Bad Federal case in Missouri against CinFin last week with respect to C19 cases and direct physical damage definition. Could cause a short term issue although the ruling was that the plaintiffs could proceed to the next step of litigation. Hopefully, they re-insured most of the layers involved with policyholders."

"Huge dividend that has been increased every year for 65 years straight, and has a grossly depressed PPS right now...DUUHH. Going to double my investment in 1 year and earn mad rent at the same time too. There are few more solid investments IMHO."
would be nice to see it close above $60 today￼
Bow wow.
I bought my first shares this week. At 4% dividend and 45% off the 52 week high I could not pass it up. That is a huge margin of safety. I didn’t pull the trigger in 2008-09 when solid dividend payers like this had huge yields. I think the market will sell off significantly again over the next few months and I will be buying Aristocrats and Kings the whole way.
"No posts, really? CINF is awesome and nothing but crickets on this board. I bought in on May 8, 2020 and am now up 95% plus generous dividends the whole way. Where's the love? This stock has more than held up its end of the bargain to make people lots of money in not a lot of time."
I wonder what the impact of this will be? https://www.theinsurer.com/news/cincinnati-financial-did-not-specifically-exclude-virus-from-property-policies/8284.article
"With a 3%+ dividend, I see a lot of upside for CINF."
seems the question asked of Cincinnati president was whether their reinsurance treaty had a virus exclusion in it. Cincinnati President said no.
"500 shares at $66.37 at 5:32pm. ?????? I had a sell order in for way less and it just went over me. Who knows, but, weird."

This is an elite insurance company with consistently superior results. Valuation is valid and deserved.
"This is a straight up shake down. There is no way the insurance industry is going to foot the bill for businesses being shut down on the narrative that the virus equates to physical structural damage to the buildings they operate in. It is an incredibly weak argument that is going to be easily framed as absurd by one of the most lawyered industries on the planet. This dip is 100% smoke and mirrors on that basis...a smaller customer base when the dust settles as businesses fold or shift away from brick and mortar is a different, but much smaller, more legitimate argument. Bet against this stock at your own peril...I will happily collect my near 5% dividend in the meantime and cash out my chips for double my money a year or less from now."
How much exposure does CINF have to the Texas burst pipes
"For all of those who posted part of a comment and made it seem dire that they don’t have a clause for non coverage of a pandemic, please read the entire quote. They don’t need it because they are covering physical damage, Here is the full quote:There is another point about future loss experience uncertainty that I want to emphasize, and we've heard investors ask related questions on other calls. Virtually, all of our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss to property, no coverage exists for this peril, rendering an exclusion unnecessary. For this reason, most of our standard market commercial property policies in states where we actively write business do not contain a specific exclusion for COVID-19. While we will evaluate each claim based on the specific facts and circumstance involved, our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Throughout our company's 70-year history, we've weathered many storms, and we have the technology, the risk management expertise and the financial strength to weather this one. We have the best people in the industry. Together, we'll take care of our Cincinnati family, protecting the health of our associates, serving agents and policyholders and emerging as an organization with new strengths to carry us forward."
Its going UP soon guys. Keep patience.
