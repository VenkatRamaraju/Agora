"Bad Federal case in Missouri against CinFin last week with respect to C19 cases and direct physical damage definition. Could cause a short term issue although the ruling was that the plaintiffs could proceed to the next step of litigation. Hopefully, they re-insured most of the layers involved with policyholders."
why is cinf down so much today on such bullish day.. any idea?
60 dollars soon.
CINF is up 4.98% to 92.06
RSI still low and just crossed the signal line. Good chance that there is a room to run.
Book cost $50
CINF reached a 52 Week low at 77.14
"Yup, definitely an ugly day for the PPS, nice to know that all of us longs will be collecting rent via dividends while we wait for it to return to its upward trajectory. Think of it like a very high yield CD...this stock is like money in the bank."
CINF reached a 52 Week low at 78.26
CINF is down 7.71% to 83.06
"What a funny, weak, short effort in afterhours...only to be steamrolled in the morning by the longs. Just give up already, CINF is awesome."
Its going UP soon guys. Keep patience.
Cincinnati Financial is down 5.03% to 80.05
Cincinnati Financial is down 5.33% to 78.57

Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 52.51
IS ANYONE AWARE THE CINF PULLED OUT OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA? ….and do you know why?
Shut up.
CINF is up 5.13% to 76.01
I bought my first shares this week. At 4% dividend and 45% off the 52 week high I could not pass it up. That is a huge margin of safety. I didn’t pull the trigger in 2008-09 when solid dividend payers like this had huge yields. I think the market will sell off significantly again over the next few months and I will be buying Aristocrats and Kings the whole way.
"With a 3%+ dividend, I see a lot of upside for CINF."
What happened?
Cincinnati Financial is down 9.17% to 74.51
Nice day. Interest rates?
"Wow, I read the transcript, this question combined with the multiple event question on the tower was a head turner.Question - I'm sorry, so I understand, so is -- it covers all perils? Steven Justus Johnston, Cincinnati Financial Corporation - President, CEO & Director [15]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's generally a property-- it's a property catastrophe risk policy and they follow our fortunes, and we'd have a virus exclusion in there."
Imagine my shock when the stock rose over 3% in one day! Thanks to my DD and the folks on this board! Anyone have any 1 month and year price estimates? Thanks.
CINF is down 4.90% to 98.07
Almost a new 52 week low again. This stock having real trouble getting any traction. Still have hopes though.
@Board Did I forget t say please for the 1 year and 1 month price estimates. Thanks.
Rome is burning my friends. Nero won’t save you.
good buy guys ??
Cincinnati Financial is up 5.66% to 93.69
Got in today. Wish me luck!!!
This is an elite insurance company with consistently superior results. Valuation is valid and deserved.
"Shorts are pushing price down. Would not be surprised if larger company begins to sniff. Management should be fired, to many chiefs not enough indians"
"500 shares at $66.37 at 5:32pm. ?????? I had a sell order in for way less and it just went over me. Who knows, but, weird."
"Where are all the nay sayers?. Bought it at 46$ when many were screaming sell, sell citing absence of pandemic clause in CINF policies. Now selling the stock at 90$ in couple weeks time. Glad to rotate and jump onto next opportunity."
"If people read the commentary, there should be no reason for a decline. Idiots selling. Great time to buy."
"At 83 it’s going to rise more, it’s still fair price overall"
Another solid quarter
Is this a good buy now?. Dividend King...but bad results?.
Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 82.59
Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 50.92
Solid 1st quarter results
Cincinnati Financial is up 9.14% to 53.75
"This is a straight up shake down. There is no way the insurance industry is going to foot the bill for businesses being shut down on the narrative that the virus equates to physical structural damage to the buildings they operate in. It is an incredibly weak argument that is going to be easily framed as absurd by one of the most lawyered industries on the planet. This dip is 100% smoke and mirrors on that basis...a smaller customer base when the dust settles as businesses fold or shift away from brick and mortar is a different, but much smaller, more legitimate argument. Bet against this stock at your own peril...I will happily collect my near 5% dividend in the meantime and cash out my chips for double my money a year or less from now."
CINF is up 5.37% to $75.60
may I know why fall?
"How will this tropical storm ""I"" affect Cinf ?"
Ideal short. Stretched valuation. And check out how short-selling funds have CINF in their sights.
CINF is up 6.85% to 71.36
"Bought 3rd lot this morning as this has dropped. Can’t see the fear. 1Q loss of $1.226B after $1.303B reduction in equities still held. That’s called “mark to market”. Dow at year-end closing somewhere between 28,414 to 28,675 depending on exact date they closed their books. End of Q1, Dow between 18,831 and 22,208, again depending on closing date. Could be almost 10,000 pt. Swing. Same effect will happen only in favor at 6/30 with Dow up. Right now at 24,557. That could be almost 6,000 pt difference between Q1 and Q2. Also, DWP is up 10% and current AY Combined is 91.5% vs 92.7% last year, meaning more volume at more profit. This is a long term play, not a flip. Hang in and it will pay big."
This stock will be collapsed?... declining every day
"Expect a big jump when 2Q results are released 7/27. Expectation is .67, but 3 out of last 4 Qtrs exceeded by average of 18%. DWP in Q1 was up 10%, and with insurance pricing increasing, probably up more, barring COVID adjustments for exposure base shrinkage. AY2020 loss ratio down over last year and with assets mostly recovering from 1Q markdowns, would not be surprised to see $1.00 or more EPS."
Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 47.67
Lots of insider buying the past few days. Let see if that stops the bleeding lol
would be nice to see it close above $60 today￼
"No posts, really? CINF is awesome and nothing but crickets on this board. I bought in on May 8, 2020 and am now up 95% plus generous dividends the whole way. Where's the love? This stock has more than held up its end of the bargain to make people lots of money in not a lot of time."
Cincinnati Financial reached a 52 Week low at 57.72
"it reached -10%, SEC short selling restrictions will kick in tomorrow"
"Huge dividend that has been increased every year for 65 years straight, and has a grossly depressed PPS right now...DUUHH. Going to double my investment in 1 year and earn mad rent at the same time too. There are few more solid investments IMHO."
this follows dgaz to a t will buy at cheaper prices
Buy Buy Buy
CINF is down 7.10% to 78.95
"Yeah, the usual, bash the stock, downgrade it and in two weeks it's a strong buy lol"
Down more as the day went on. No love for this stock right now.

"Holly $%@@&$ WOW, Batman ! In a rising market and the absence of major casualty losses CINF shouldn't be doing this."

"Across all industry, guess which market segment does the most due diligence, has the deepest financial reserves, retains the most magna level lawyers, and is best equipped to ride out unforeseen events...insurance companies. Good luck shorts, you are literally betting against the house."

When are we selling?
"Bought in today, almost 4% dividend. Lets hope it bottomed."
CINF is up 4.95% to 104.71
CINF reached an all time high at $85.00
"Not many recent comments regarding CINF. It might be a great buy once it hits the 60's. Many utilities have better yields, but 3.5% on an insurance company sounds good, plus the dividend has plenty of room to grow, based on the earnings estimates. I am not sure that it can go much lower, so I will see what is happening on Monday."

"This stock just up $14 after hour, does anyone know what’s going on here?"
Dividend declared at same amount and this just will not go up. Should have run away a few days ago. Don't know when/if this will ever turn green. Still here though.
"Well, it did hit a new 52 week low. Bounced off a little bit, but, this stock is a nightmare right now. On an up day, it inches up and on a down day, it gets crushed. Still hopeful that it will go up."
Any news from CINF?
"Can you say ROUGH WEEK for this stock. Hopefully up from here.If they declare a dividend, that would help settle things down a little."

There are 2 insurance stocks worth owning. Cincinnati which may be the best independent agency company is US with broad portfolio of products. Second company to own is Progressive which still is ahead of the market with outstanding analytics.

financials are headed lower. invesotors dont know how much toxic assets is in their books. they keep telling us financials are sound but price movement says diferent story. cinf is headed lower until some clarity established. only opportunity i see right now is in energy since energy has bottomed out. a company like oneok and EPD are rewarding investments at this level with life time of income

"For all of those who posted part of a comment and made it seem dire that they don’t have a clause for non coverage of a pandemic, please read the entire quote. They don’t need it because they are covering physical damage, Here is the full quote:There is another point about future loss experience uncertainty that I want to emphasize, and we've heard investors ask related questions on other calls. Virtually, all of our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss to property, no coverage exists for this peril, rendering an exclusion unnecessary. For this reason, most of our standard market commercial property policies in states where we actively write business do not contain a specific exclusion for COVID-19. While we will evaluate each claim based on the specific facts and circumstance involved, our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Throughout our company's 70-year history, we've weathered many storms, and we have the technology, the risk management expertise and the financial strength to weather this one. We have the best people in the industry. Together, we'll take care of our Cincinnati family, protecting the health of our associates, serving agents and policyholders and emerging as an organization with new strengths to carry us forward."
