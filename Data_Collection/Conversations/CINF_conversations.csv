When are we selling?
Shares of several financial stocks are trading higher amid positive vaccine news. A return to more normal business operations could indicate more financing activity and higher interest rates.Benzinga
Looks like a decent buy here down $10 today
Almost a new 52 week low again. This stock having real trouble getting any traction. Still have hopes though.
"Bought 3rd lot this morning as this has dropped. Can’t see the fear. 1Q loss of $1.226B after $1.303B reduction in equities still held. That’s called “mark to market”. Dow at year-end closing somewhere between 28,414 to 28,675 depending on exact date they closed their books. End of Q1, Dow between 18,831 and 22,208, again depending on closing date. Could be almost 10,000 pt. Swing. Same effect will happen only in favor at 6/30 with Dow up. Right now at 24,557. That could be almost 6,000 pt difference between Q1 and Q2. Also, DWP is up 10% and current AY Combined is 91.5% vs 92.7% last year, meaning more volume at more profit. This is a long term play, not a flip. Hang in and it will pay big."
"For all of those who posted part of a comment and made it seem dire that they don’t have a clause for non coverage of a pandemic, please read the entire quote. They don’t need it because they are covering physical damage, Here is the full quote:There is another point about future loss experience uncertainty that I want to emphasize, and we've heard investors ask related questions on other calls. Virtually, all of our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss to property, no coverage exists for this peril, rendering an exclusion unnecessary. For this reason, most of our standard market commercial property policies in states where we actively write business do not contain a specific exclusion for COVID-19. While we will evaluate each claim based on the specific facts and circumstance involved, our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Throughout our company's 70-year history, we've weathered many storms, and we have the technology, the risk management expertise and the financial strength to weather this one. We have the best people in the industry. Together, we'll take care of our Cincinnati family, protecting the health of our associates, serving agents and policyholders and emerging as an organization with new strengths to carry us forward."
"Huge dividend that has been increased every year for 65 years straight, and has a grossly depressed PPS right now...DUUHH. Going to double my investment in 1 year and earn mad rent at the same time too. There are few more solid investments IMHO."
Got in today. Wish me luck!!!
seems the question asked of Cincinnati president was whether their reinsurance treaty had a virus exclusion in it. Cincinnati President said no.
I put in my buy for more stock in CINF. I have owned for at least 15 years when it was around $25 a share. have been very happy
"Well, it did hit a new 52 week low. Bounced off a little bit, but, this stock is a nightmare right now. On an up day, it inches up and on a down day, it gets crushed. Still hopeful that it will go up."
"Where are all the nay sayers?. Bought it at 46$ when many were screaming sell, sell citing absence of pandemic clause in CINF policies. Now selling the stock at 90$ in couple weeks time. Glad to rotate and jump onto next opportunity."
"No posts, really? CINF is awesome and nothing but crickets on this board. I bought in on May 8, 2020 and am now up 95% plus generous dividends the whole way. Where's the love? This stock has more than held up its end of the bargain to make people lots of money in not a lot of time."
Cincinnati Financial stock price target raised to $135 from $120 at MKM Partners https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/news/article?c_name=invest_VENDOR&docKey=1952-1465924-1
Buy Buy Buy
"Bought in today, almost 4% dividend. Lets hope it bottomed."
Credit Suisse: Neutral to Underperform 5/6/2020This explains today's loss.
Dividend declared at same amount and this just will not go up. Should have run away a few days ago. Don't know when/if this will ever turn green. Still here though.
"Covid-19 exposure will have no impact, How can one put specific language into a policy concerning a pandemic. Does not make sense."
Is this a good buy now?. Dividend King...but bad results?.
"Across all industry, guess which market segment does the most due diligence, has the deepest financial reserves, retains the most magna level lawyers, and is best equipped to ride out unforeseen events...insurance companies. Good luck shorts, you are literally betting against the house."
RSI still low and just crossed the signal line. Good chance that there is a room to run.
Haven’t seen a buying opportunity like this since BGS hit $11. I am backing the truck up!
"500 shares at $66.37 at 5:32pm. ?????? I had a sell order in for way less and it just went over me. Who knows, but, weird."
Once in a lifetime sale!! Screaming Buy. Safe dividend and solid management.
This is an elite insurance company with consistently superior results. Valuation is valid and deserved.
What happened?
Cincinnati Financial reached an all time high at 126.93
"Cincinnati Financial (CINF) Q3 Earnings Top, Revenues Up Y/YCincinnati Financial Corporation (CINF - Free Report) reported third-quarter 2019 operating income of $1.08 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.1%. Also, the bottom line improved 28.6% year over year.Notably, the results reflected price increases and premium growth initiatives."
"This is a straight up shake down. There is no way the insurance industry is going to foot the bill for businesses being shut down on the narrative that the virus equates to physical structural damage to the buildings they operate in. It is an incredibly weak argument that is going to be easily framed as absurd by one of the most lawyered industries on the planet. This dip is 100% smoke and mirrors on that basis...a smaller customer base when the dust settles as businesses fold or shift away from brick and mortar is a different, but much smaller, more legitimate argument. Bet against this stock at your own peril...I will happily collect my near 5% dividend in the meantime and cash out my chips for double my money a year or less from now."
There are 2 insurance stocks worth owning. Cincinnati which may be the best independent agency company is US with broad portfolio of products. Second company to own is Progressive which still is ahead of the market with outstanding analytics.
Any news from CINF?
"Can you say ROUGH WEEK for this stock. Hopefully up from here.If they declare a dividend, that would help settle things down a little."
I'm waiting for 84 dollars and not a cent below!
"Expect a big jump when 2Q results are released 7/27. Expectation is .67, but 3 out of last 4 Qtrs exceeded by average of 18%. DWP in Q1 was up 10%, and with insurance pricing increasing, probably up more, barring COVID adjustments for exposure base shrinkage. AY2020 loss ratio down over last year and with assets mostly recovering from 1Q markdowns, would not be surprised to see $1.00 or more EPS."
Lots of insider buying the past few days. Let see if that stops the bleeding lol
This is a gift. Dividend is rock solid and growing. Stock goes to 80+ this year easy.
Up eighty six cents after hours.....hopefully we will see $60 sometime this week
Ideal short. Stretched valuation. And check out how short-selling funds have CINF in their sights.
why is cinf down so much today on such bullish day.. any idea?
