"Nothing but up from here. WY helping out with distribution, cuts costs for everyone to streamline. In addition to:approximately 400 million lbs of scrap and waste were diverted from landfills in 2020. the company announced a goal to divert 1 billion pounds of waste per year by 2026 (!)The new Boise facility will be AZEK’s 9th, joining facilities in OH, PA, andMN. part of AZEK’s $180 million capacity expansion programBTFD"
any reason why the big drop today? I was thinking to open a position on this but dang 7% drop? what's the reason?
"5/4-in x 6-in x 12-ft Standard Pressure Treated Lumber Decking is $18.53 (1.54/LF) *way up in price6-in x 12-ft Timbertech/Azek Composite Decking $21.48 (1.79/LF)Substructure is the same, labor to install is the same. Composite has a 25yr warranty. Treated has to be stained/sealed (material & labor) after install and again every 1-3 years. Which one are you going with? Look for HUGE year over year increase in sales. Not to mention Covid and the increased spending on home improvements."

"Under the ABL facility, if availability is less than the greater of $12.5 million and 10% of the line cap, The AZEK Company Inc. (“Holdings”) must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1x. The covenant testing period continues until availability exceeds such threshold for 30 consecutive days, and equity cures are permitted.This covenant is not currently tested, but if it were, the company would be in compliance.

This is a long game - they have tons of potential - if someone is getting in with a get rich scheme this isn’t it. It should be a slow steady climb up. Building materials and companies are not a short term invest.
I bought in @$40... (under$500 worth) - may buy in some more. Looking for a long-term hold (5-10 years). SMH at all the day/swing traders here thinking this should go somewhere in 3 months... If it does - great! But expecting it and dumping if it doesn't?!? Are they even aware of what they are buying? Isn't this a building supplies company that will need a few seasonal cycles to have their product become know?
Casual 6% sell off for no reason
Company looks interesting but a lot of debt!
"$WEBR is really fairly priced when you think about it. More people definitely doing home cooking, making lifestyle changes with work from home. That's why $AZEK makes sense too."
There’s no conversations here. Nobody likes this company? Such a great product.
Is the cost of Natural Gas causing raw material costing concerns? Why down 7%+ today? I might add to my position. I think longer term Natural Gas returns to much lower prices. I thought their products were largely recycled content so I am in the dark as to if this is what is going on here.
hmm...this seems pretty darn cheap but maybe not sexy? volume is drying up so a little hesitant. anybody out there?
PPS of $132 for AZEK looks doable compared to TREX. Home improvement projects have increased due Covid-19. I was at Lowe's last weekend and the store was filled with shoppers. Revenues for AZEK could double easily when they report in August.
"This is a great product. This will be a great stock. They are just scratching the surface, nice news￼https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weyerhaeuser-distribution-expands-azek-portfolio-110000323.html"
What does AZEK have to do with trailers?
Here we go ready with 65 in this one

"$trex gets upgrade and $azek goes down. $azek has a superior product! And, is a cheaper stock!!! It's clearly being manipulated."
Cramer the carnival Barker called this a long-term buy tonight. Many months ago and at a higher price he said Wall Street had this stock wrong when it went down after earnings. He said this was a screaming by as the insiders were unloading. It's great to be Cramer and to never be wrong especially when you're wrong as much as you are right
