what time can i buy
I would like to invest in flooring. Which one (AZEK or TREX) is a better buy in a short (1 month) and long term (1 years)? Thanks in advance! Cramer prefers AZEK over TREX but which one you like and why?
AZEK is down 5.15% to 45.29
I think this is really good to take care of debt
AZEK is up 5.52% to 34.19
revenue beat by 7pct. EPS beat by 21pct
AZEK reached an all time high at 36.74
This stock has so little coverage but after next earnings it's going to break out big time. Will be up 10 bucks in a week
Institutions moving in.
Nice little 75000 share buy just went by the ticker
It opened at 27.50.........so it actually lost about 15cents...........
"This share price is silly. No idea who controls this stock, but they hold it down for sure. Earnings report was excellent. Future is bright. Share price range bound -20-25% from where it should be."
AZEK is up 5.93% to 37.14
AZEK reached an all time high at 38.50
Charts looks good. Falling wedge formation waiting for break out. Get in early going $46!!
Another major drop coming!!! They sold shares on the 15th.
"Azek has $1.2 billion in debt, which is equal to 64% of total assets, according to RapidRatings.The company’s interest coverage was 0.71 times in 2019, meaning the company was unable to fully meet its interest obligations with operating profit. Interest expense rose to $83.2 million from $68.7 million.The prospectus acknowledges the risks the company would face if it is unable to generate sufficient cash to service its debt...........BK.“Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations............leading to BK.Well........to put it mildly......and realistically......this is a $$ disaster in the making. Invest at your own risk."
"AZEK, should initiate a program whereby, home improvementcontractors attend a 2 day training session and thereby become certifiedinstallers of AZEK products. Moreover, the contractors would provideverification of financial credit-ability and work experience.The contractor would pay $2500 fee to AZEK for certification.I love the AZEK product line, the thought of buying fencing at HomeDepot and hiring a journeyman contractor to do the installation prevents mefrom buying the product."
They are treating this like a stay at home stock
Big volume. Absorbing insiders selling
AZEK is up 5.82% to 39.81
Yeah we really might see 50 by December
30 by close?
These guys are pumping and dumping their own stock. Where was Kramer today. He's been pounding the table on his stock and this is the second secondary they've done. Not one dime of either secondary has gone to the company only insiders.
My only thing is why were the insiders so desperate to dump this they did two secondaries within months
"Sleeper here. I'd expect really strong earnings this Q, given housing trends. Given Trex move, surprised this is so under the radar."
Anybody got any news on this company
"Had dinner with a friend who is a very experienced contractor and asked about Azek products. Didn't even know he'd know the company. Turns out, he swears by them. Said they were far superior to $trex and he always chooses azek (timbertech) over trex. He also likes their other building supplies and views them as excellent quality, which he always chooses if needed in the project. Had genuine enthusiam all around."
AZEK is down 5.09% to 34.84
AZEK reached an all time high at 44.11
Can someone help me understand why this stock is falling right now?
"Beat on revenue, beat on earnings. Let's retrace yesterday's loss!"
AZEK is up 4.90% to 47.06
https://discord.gg/pcbYxCW
"Love it, picked up a ton today and didn't know Kramer was going to this piece"
Here we go ready with 65 in this one
The MMs in this stock should be investigated. Once again my offer and I don't sell stock. Last sale as 48.82 Offered at 85. I offer 500 at 81. Trades at. .80 then at 81 still just showed 500 offered. I didn't sell any. This isn't the first time. They always front run you. Where is the SEC.
AZEK reached an all time high at 34.10
I like this company..It is going to double in no time
AZEK is down 5.00% to 40.88
I bought today bc I’m rebuilding my huge deck and I chose azek material over trex bc it looks better and the store was recommending it over trex. Buy what you like as they say. And everyone I showed samples to loved azek over trex. So there you go.
"5/4-in x 6-in x 12-ft Standard Pressure Treated Lumber Decking is $18.53 (1.54/LF) *way up in price6-in x 12-ft Timbertech/Azek Composite Decking $21.48 (1.79/LF)Substructure is the same, labor to install is the same. Composite has a 25yr warranty. Treated has to be stained/sealed (material & labor) after install and again every 1-3 years. Which one are you going with? Look for HUGE year over year increase in sales. Not to mention Covid and the increased spending on home improvements."

When can u buy this stock what time?
"Just built a new dock. Chose Azek product over Trex. It is far superior. Dock builder hadn't used it before but after building dock said it would be his recommended product. Better warranty, nonslip vs Trex etc. A lot of upside as products become more widely utilized / recognized. Not cheap but superior products arte valuable."
AZEK is down 4.93% to 46.84
What does AZEK have to do with trailers?
I guess this needs the market to go up oh wait a minute the market's soaring maybe it's just a #$%$
More blood-letting or a gold watch tomorrow - I'll hold for a while.
hmm...this seems pretty darn cheap but maybe not sexy? volume is drying up so a little hesitant. anybody out there?
Another punishing secondary these crooks are the worst I'm gone
#$%$ is going on here
"North America wide Pressure treated lumber shortage, guys doing my deck said anyone doing a deck is gonna have to do pvc/composite, this should appreciate nicely as a result!"
"Stock really trades horribly. Shame, it's a good co."
AZEK is down 4.91% to 40.89
Earnings tomorrow I'm predicting blowout. Going public before it happens.
When will AZEK start trading
The market maker in this stock is a #$%$ and belongs in.jail. I'm not a newbie was a specialist on the NYSE floor for years. If we pulled the #$%$ this guy does they would have taken us off in handcuffs
$AZEK is a perfect example of what’s going to win with millennials buying/building houses. Younger generations are going to fall all over this due to how fantastic their ESG is.
yoyo
We appear to be heading for $65 inagreement with Caleb.
What the hell is happening here? Great Q. Raised guidance! Should be $55-$60. Shorts are in control. Why?
AZEK is up 5.03% to 35.68
You have to ask yourself why the Insiders couldn't wait to get out of this stock
Company looks interesting but a lot of debt!
"-20% in 1 month. Lumber prices? Shouldn't be that big of an impact on their sales, but maybe a reason people were buying? Insider sales? In the scheme of things it's not that much -- albeit annoying. I assumed after that Q it was headed to $55, so what am I not understanding???"
Right now before the rocket launches
Thoughts on preliminary earnings ?
AZEK is up 5.19% to 45.08
Cramer mentions Azek in a positive way tonight but said nothing about secondary. Is he a shrill for these guys? Just asking because he's done it before
AZEK reached an all time high at 45.76
I would love if management would discuss their ongoing sales projections during this Covid 19 crisis. I would think that a lot of people are remodeling and expanding and updating their outdoor spaces. I would think that sales are strong but we need a corporate update. Also a clear outline of efforts to integrate acquisitions and pay down their debt would be appreciated. It is losing it's
Great products and no investor relations division.
"One of the most undervalued stocks, These guys are not just about deck boards they have a wide assortment of fantastic products that are being widely used across the construction industry. This is a winner, look out for earnings."
"Company is using public money to clear it’s debt , only fools going to invest FYI(RNA) came out the same day look on to their financial"
AZEK is up 5.40% to 37.48
What the hell is going on??? Good thing the CEO cashed out in the mid-forties. Sickening.
"With everybody staying home and doing home projects, this should have a very good earnings call. If you can't go out to a patio, build one on your home!"
"First quarter after IPO showing a profit, it's a win, win situation."
I bought in @$40... (under$500 worth) - may buy in some more. Looking for a long-term hold (5-10 years). SMH at all the day/swing traders here thinking this should go somewhere in 3 months... If it does - great! But expecting it and dumping if it doesn't?!? Are they even aware of what they are buying? Isn't this a building supplies company that will need a few seasonal cycles to have their product become know?
"This is a great product. This will be a great stock. They are just scratching the surface, nice news￼https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weyerhaeuser-distribution-expands-azek-portfolio-110000323.html"
"$WEBR is really fairly priced when you think about it. More people definitely doing home cooking, making lifestyle changes with work from home. That's why $AZEK makes sense too."
Price action making 0 sense after that earnings beat and raise. Who's manipulating the share price?
AZEK is down 4.96% to 38.63
Big volume a nice job by the bankers holding this thing up today. When the bear hits next week and this thing goes below40 look out below I hope they get it right in their teeth.
AZEK is down 5.15% to 36.50
I saw where this said it traded up over 39 on Kramer's piece I didn't see it I tried selling some at 38 and didn't get them off
I thought this would have better price action
get in before it rockets
This stock may double by year-end.
AZEK is down 4.94% to 43.47
"Great co. Great products. Why CEO Jesse Singh chose to sell when stock -20% from the ATH, and after Ontario got out is beyond annoying. Could be far more strategic on his wealth accumulation."
"Tim Seymour, the Dean of Wall Street,is a Champion of Azek.the foregoing per Jim Cramer show."
"Folks,I work in the building materials industryI know Azek has a lot of debtHowever the decking industry isbooming !!!!!!!! Homeowners are not travelingand spending all their time at home. Our company cannot get enough decking and railingThis stock will do well"
I'm ready to trade
AZEK is down 4.95% to 42.20
These crooks are lucky the mkt is a bull. If there's a downturn look out below I hope these guys get screwed
Dilution dilution dilution we got sandbagged
"MAI Capital Management,has filed Form 13F for Q1 2021.Opened NEW positions in $AABB $ALGT $ASH $ASHR $ATRS $AZEK $BFAM $BNS $CFRX $CLVSTry Insider Forms mobile app, get realtime notifications and more"
Upgrades coming in and rockets higher.
Does anyone know the price of the new share offering. At first I was angry then I thought if they use it to restructure debt it could be a good thing in the long run. I lean to thinking this is an ok move.
"Sold half at $50, glad I did. Sold another half last week. Loading up on HCDI and some options, but I’ll be back before next earnings."
AZEK reached an all time high at 32.66
"I can't figure out why the share price moves south. They beat & raised. Hot sector, construction continues very hot. Thoughts???"
Held up well today in a tough market. I was hoping to buy some more on the cheap but my order was never filled. I am not sure many people know this is a public company now--this one has legs in my opinion.
AZEK is down 5.09% to 30.61
PPS of $132 for AZEK looks doable compared to TREX. Home improvement projects have increased due Covid-19. I was at Lowe's last weekend and the store was filled with shoppers. Revenues for AZEK could double easily when they report in August.

"you know how I know this stock will be a winner? Someone I know, who is super cheap, is putting in their deck, because it is now cheaper than wood."
There’s no conversations here. Nobody likes this company? Such a great product.
AZEK is down 5.09% to 44.61
Today I had a bid in only 50 shares 43.38 it traded at.37 and I didn't buy any. It then traded down and I bought. I trade in 50 share lots figuring they wouldn't shoot against my orders but they just trade right through them
AZEK reached an all time high at 30.90
Tanking at the close..........Not good - Get out if you went in.
AZEK is up 5.01% to 51.28
This is a long game - they have tons of potential - if someone is getting in with a get rich scheme this isn’t it. It should be a slow steady climb up. Building materials and companies are not a short term invest.
Got in! Enjoy the show
Casual 6% sell off for no reason
Wow if a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it did it make a sound
"Do the shorts actually know something here or is this the buy of the century? I know since the advent of Robinhood no one cares about value investing anymore, but this seems a bit absurd"
Long term winner here. Lumber prices out of control and this product will only get cheaper and better. Once retail discovers this it will move
AZEK is down 7.53% to 34.50
LETS GO CHICAGO
The AZEK Company is up 6.67% to 40.00

"I love Azek’s prospects over the long term. The fact that we can empty out landfills and create a useable, high quality product is phenomenal. Millennials love it!"

AZEK reached an all time high at 31.32
Where did they price the 3rd secondary in months
Yahoo likes to take this down but the expiration for the lockup ends December 9th. I think us bagholders are keeping this one propped up so the insiders can on load on us
AZEK is up 5.57% to 36.23
"with the current lumber situation, why isn't this skyrocketing? any input?"
Is the cost of Natural Gas causing raw material costing concerns? Why down 7%+ today? I might add to my position. I think longer term Natural Gas returns to much lower prices. I thought their products were largely recycled content so I am in the dark as to if this is what is going on here.
This stock is #$%$ with way to much debt and I believe it's only been a public company for less than a year - a loser.
Cramer just recommended
Finally  going up.
Azek CEO WAS ON CNBC 'S JIM CREAMERA GREAT INTERVIEW
This company lost $21 mil. 2019 and for the 6 months ended 3/31/20 lost $6 mil. Also has $1.2 Billion in debt!! Only in America.
AZEK reached an all time high at 40.84
AZEK reached an all time high at 45.08
This is moving a lot slower than I thought. The earning will propel this to 50s
On board
"There should be a Builder Service Division at AZEK,to service local, regional and public merchant builderssuch as LEN, D.R. Horton, KB Homes etc.As an Owner/Manager of Garden Apts. complexes,would be thrilled to contact an approved AZEK dealer,and re-do our perimeter fencing requirements.AZEK could be an $80 stock with aggressive marketing."
Another dilution. Greedy garbage manegment. Time to go on with Cramer so he can pump the stock. This #$%$ has been down last two weeks. It feels like I was the only one who didn't know about this before hand
Kudos to anyone diamond handing this stock!
My guess would be that the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan is the holder selling the 15 million shares. They own 25 million shares (over $1 billion worth) and that is not very prudent for a pension plan. They never should have had this many shares in the first place.
In the last 30 daysTREX up 14%AZEK up 4%Looks like the new guy in the business is slow to the uptake. That may change
And so it goes
AZEK is down 5.11% to 33.82
Somebody bought a massive amount of 35 call options for 25cents...Expires this friday...The trader is either stupid...or he knows it will be over 35 at close on friday
We will be at $65 soon.We are buying more GPK too.
Stock acts like garbage a huge disappointment. I guess the insiders knew best when they dumped!!!!
Acts good before earnings. Glad Yeshiva is on board!!!!
Febblie recommend by Cramer tonight. I guess he had to safe face because he pounded the table on this one much higher. Plus he had his admitted buddy the chairman on . Cramer was recommending and insiders were selling. It stinks
Plan a serious drubbing this month and maybe next as well - not a good place to be right now.
I have invested in i but the strongest is RNA and its with lily better study before you miss the rocket
Whoever took $azek public was clearly the wrong horse. Weirdly down every day with little volume.
Blowout quarter and guidance - should see 50's soon!
"Under the ABL facility, if availability is less than the greater of $12.5 million and 10% of the line cap, The AZEK Company Inc.

"Feeling real good about IPO today! Lots of big lead managers (Barclays, Bank of America, Goldman, Jeffries) . This stock will be near $60-70 by end of next week, maybe higher when looking at (TREX) who is the main competitor , which sticks around 110. Great stock, gonna be a similar if not better IPO as Vroom and Nikola"
Horrible close

"Their products are flying off the shelves. look at their assortment compared to trex. Try to order, call lowes or homedepot... delays on everything due to demand."
Many on here are saying the 25 million share dilution is being used to pay down debt it is not. It's people who are insiders being permitted to sell their stock this has nothing to do with the debt of this company
AZEK reached an all time high at 40.27
I’ll take a dip to buy more
An INdian ceo on outdoor bldg. supply company. I guess I have biases. I buy VRT instead
"I’ve been adding a little bit at a time since the IPO. A little trading too. I don’t usually like buying a stock into earnings but I’m feeling good about this one. Construction costs are slowing construction, that bodes well I think that materials are short supply and high demand, and why does any fool by lumber anymore for decking."
With in year near 100
"I went from being an absolute AZEK bull based on their products, to hating the company based on their stock."
AZEK is down 5.09% to 38.68
Stay Bullish. TREX ain't got nothing on us.
Never a good sign when you see the CEO selling when the price drops 20% from recent highs. He should be leading the buyers into this huge opportunity stock. He still has a bunch of stock.
This stock is being treated like it is tied to lumber and it isn't. Huge buying opportunity for the longs here. I bought my first shares today. This is going back to the highs.
... Sell!
"Earnings in another week, this should have a nice jump."
what date did lockup end? Was it Wednesday or Thursday
Why in the world are you in the market when anyone can see it is declining - nuts!
lockup ended. we expecting insider selling?
27.30+4.30 (+18.70%)As of 1:50PM EDT. Market open.
I can only imagine if the earnings were bad
"dont believe krammer,hepumpingthestock because heprobably own thestock, azek lost 64 million kammer,so shut upkammer"
Robinhood has the wrong earnings date listed for 2nd quarter ... 5/31 instead of 5/13! Yikes.... some people are going to miss out on the run up this Thursday:) 
"why didnt krammer say the company lost 64 million for the year ,krammer is a scamer"
$azek trades at 7x sales and $trex 12x. Azek just announced a great q and has a tiny float. I thought we might see $55-60 given the company comparison. What am I missing???

"This stock went down because both the Ontario Teachers Pension Board and ARES Management sold ~30% of their position. My guess is they took their profits. What they don't see, is that lumber prices may not come down right away like people expect. This is going up again next earnings."
big beat!
The best stock that no one knows about
Why would anyone give away their shares to the shorts? The guidance was raised. I'll take these gifts with great alacrity.
Next week will be double
AZEK is down 5.10% to 40.01
The housing market is booming this is a great product the dilution was ill-timed and costly but this stock should rebound nicely.Lumber prices at all time high and this product is superior to lumber
red
AZEK is up 7.84% to 33.43
Buying dip on a scale down. Would like to get long 1000 half way there
AZEK is going to take u to the Pot of Gold.
Up on very light volume. Watch out for a big drop
any reason why the big drop today? I was thinking to open a position on this but dang 7% drop? what's the reason?
I raise my 1 year price target to $95
