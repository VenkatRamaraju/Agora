"Ok so I get it - rising interest rates and all housing related stocks are out of favor right now. But, how low is too low? Where’s the bottom on BLD?? Insulation?? Insulation?!? That’s one product that will never go out of style! I’m in the house of pain but holding on. Too good of a company. May take some time but this one will rise again."

Anyone on this message board have a sense for the business impact on BLD from virus. Are most construction jobs proceeding or canceled/ pushed out?
homebuilders are moving today driving Topbuild up....cheap stock with earnings coming up with a dovish Fed....the run may continue going into earnings!!
Any rational explanations for how this stock is traded ... priced ?
Three times normal volume! Earnings due early next month. A leak perhaps?
