"(TLGT), a New Jersey-based specialty generic pharmaceutical company, today announced it has received approval of the Company's abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Gentamicin Sulfate Cream USP, 0.1% (gentamicin base).2019. 10. 18.After 1year good news coming."
Reply to an e-mail sent last week....Thank you for your continued investment in Teligent and understand your concerns.We will provide the market with a full update on our next earnings call (day and time tbd but within the first half of November).Damian Finio / CFO
April will be one year below $1. The “something good” needs to happen soon. I don’t want to see the reverse split vs delisting scenario. Patience is tough when you have deadlines.
"I am a veteran and one of the creams Teligent has is Desonide. This is used for skin diseases which i use. So I'm in Long hoping they can get all the products back in the market. Between now and re-inspection expect the stock to be played with. Also, yesterday I asked Benzinga to try and get $TLGT to do a powerhour and they gave me a thumbs up through DM so im hoping that's an ""attempt"" response."

"Well unless the new facility inspection has been completed, do not expect it any time soon.https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-focuses-safety-regulated-products-while-scaling-back-domestic?utm_campaign=031820_PR_Coronavirus%20%28COVID-19%29%20Update%3A%20FDA%20Focuses%20on%20Safety%20of%20Regulated%20Products&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua"
"Well, after some additional thinking, I no longer think the price erosion is primarily driven by tax harvesting. I am thinking the decline has much to do with the extinguishing of the 3.75% Convertible Notes and (likely) related covering of the massive short position - a process that I believe is already underway (the short interest declined in the first half of December) but will take some time to complete. Namely, according to Dec 14, 2018 8-K filing regarding the New $125M Senior Credit Facility, "".... The proceeds from the New Senior Credit Facility will be used for, among other things, ..... the repurchase or redemption of the Company’s outstanding 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”)...."". In other words, the 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 are being extinguished. Recall that the convertible notes were issued back by IGI Laboratories in Dec 2014 in the principal amount of $125M (indenture by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association from Dec 16, 2014) - .see 8-K filing from Dec 2014. I don't have access to historical short interest records going back to IGI Lab times, but many here on the board have noted that the big short (~9M-or so shares) was established shortly after the original sale of the 3.75% convertible notes, presumably, by the same note buyer. Considering that the notes are now being extinguished, it would make sense for the owner of the convertibles who is presumably also massively short, to cover its short position. If I were that party, I would make sure to exploit the current negativity surrounding Teligent (management snafus, downward revenue guidance revision, no profitability, FDA delays ...), abysmally bad TLGT chart technicals, as well as the bad market conditions overall (S&P nose dive from October) and drive TLGT price share as low as I possibly could so I could cover my large short position before the company has a chance to update the market next time (highly unlikely there will be any updates until early Jan or perhaps until the next earnings release). In summary, I am speculating that the large short position is in process of being covered and that the TLGT price nose-dive over the past month is closely tied to the new $125 Credit Facility and the use of proceeds to repurchase/redeem the 3.75% convertible notes.Thoughts ?"
"From JGG on April 12th, anything other than this today is criminal. “We continue to believe in the guidance that we have provided the market for 2019. This includes achieving double digit top line percentage growth with revenues in excess of $72.5 million, a consolidated gross margin above 40%, a consistent investment in R&D of $13 – 15 million, and an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 10% after adding back any foreign currency gains or losses and non-cash stock expenses.”"
"I would just like a 5-10 minute sit-down with Jim, aka James C. Gale, and find out what he knows as a Director and Chairman of the Board, and as someone who is on a multitude of other pharmacy-related boards, is well-versed in private investments, and holds an MBA from the University of Chicago. A candid conversation would have me buying him whatever lunch he wanted. NSB"
"Strategic review is only slightly better than strategic alternatives. Quarter must have been down and need cash. Sell assets or dilute. Hard to dilute at this share price. Already cut R&D, no ANDA approvals for over 5 months, waiting for the lower guidance. And no I do not have any evidence or research to back these statements, just my opinion. If anyone, except Adrienne, can make the argument that things are going well over there, I would love to here it."
Finio said he doesn't need to reiterate guidance for a fourth time. I think he does.

"shorties, help me get this below 40 cents so i can buy more"
Post split the float will b about $5.4 million shares. Will be a nice low floater and will pop on any positive news
"Almost two months in what is the tightest trading range I have ever seen. Most days within 1 cent, seems impossible."
i am just speculating but maybe someone can chime in here tell me if i am wrong. the company has 9 jobs posted and the jobs being posted make me think the fda audit is going well and approval is imminent?? if this happens $ 2-3 like a rocket ???
"They are hiring, about a dozen open positions, condireding the headcount that's significant. Not a bad sign in my book."
"Teligent shows their ability to be responsive with their supply chain:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teligent-secures-critical-supply-during-123000485.htmlAs a person with decades of experience with international pharma supply chains, I know this is exactly what the clients want and expect. The Canadian health system will not forget.I am sure this effort was profitable in the short-term. However, the long-term effects by solidifying a relationship with an important client are invaluable."
Can't believe JGG or any other insider hasn't bought a few shares. IF they really believe in their guidance this is a no brainer. JGG certainly knew something when he sold a third of his shares last September at $4.
this stock was before 5 years 83k lets do that

"Price increase steadily, don't understand why... anyway, great. Will wait a little before selling this one"
Down 23% in one day on no news on almost double the average volume.Neither the company nor insiders are buying up shares and some of these people are millionaires a few times over. Management has not said one word since CEO reiterate guidance on April 12 when the stock closed at $1.02 a share. Someone knows something and has for some time. I expect a BK filing now. What other explanation could there be? I am holding but expect to lose my investment here.
Once the injection site is approved by the FDA along with the first couple injection products then TLGT becomes an acquisition target by big pharma. all I know is that $0.70 all the way up to $5 is cheap for a generic maker with injection capabilities.
Very tempting entry point....just worried about the dilution....also this silence indicates....some big news..
i will drive by the company headquarters in Buena to see how full the parking lot is....
"The 50%+ drop from April 30th-June 11th coincides with the failed inspections and Teligent's response letter, yet I cannot find any disclosure to the shareholders in this same time period. Someone told their friends.?"

"While I appreciate the optics of these insiders buys, the dollar amounts are hardly convincing. If any insider truly believed in this company or it's management don't you think a million share purchase would be a little more convincing. These are multi -millionaires writing a check for $7,000 for 10,000 shares, again, hardly a sign of overwhelming confidence."
I'm sorry but companies don't go from $4.52 a share to 48 cents a share in less than a year without horrible nail in coffin news. Some one thinks this company is going out of business. Typically when a CEO reiterates guidance after a selloff the stock comes back. This CEO did that when the stock was above $1.00 so it's lost another 50% since. There are numerous companies in actual bankruptcy that have a higher multiple than TGLT. Something illegal is going on here.
"Been handing out a lot of restricted shares. I'm guessing this means resolutions have passed, I haven't seen an official press release yet."
"we have provided the market for 2019.

We have recently confirmed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) an expedited review pathway for the first injectable drug that will trigger FDA inspection of the site. We are confident that this plan will allow us to commercialize product and recognize revenue at the earliest possible point,” continued Mr. Grenfell-Gardner."

"Per the Earnings Conference Call, TLGT was going to provide another response to the Warning Letter to the FDA in mid-September. With all the back and forth, it would be my guess and hope that some of the items on punch list have been completed. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge in this field to where the WL could be lifted based on their progress to date and with this next submission to FDA? I've heard the term ""consent decree"" thrown around in this context and would like to know if it is a possibility for our current situation. Thanks!"
Looking good even it's crawling up slowly at least it's going up. Thinking of buying more once I sold some of my stock from other pharma company.
"The only thing that is going to move the share price is hitting the next revenue number. They have had too many misses and no one believes anything they say at this point. If they come in at 17 mill for this quarter and reiterate full year, we will go up, anything less, game over, for us and JGG."
who still there?
"We know 3 things: Earnings for the qtr will at least $15 million, the injection facility has been built (any changes/improvements are being worked on), the first injection drug from the new facility has been submitted for approval. The company makes at least $60 million per year right now which is enough to manage debt, research and improvements. So bash away all you want...2020 will be very good."

Does anyone have info on status of regulatory filing to prompt FDA re-inspection or clearance of the warning letter status?

"Digging down into NoSureBet's item #1: 2017 full year rev of $65MM to $67MMSeems like low ball guidance to me. 9mo17 revenue is 52MM so to hit their guidance they need a 13MM to 15MM quarter. Meaning flat to 3q17 numbers will do the trick. However, consider ANDA approvals that are due to ramp in the quarter:Desonide Lotion 0.05%Triamcinolone Acetonide 1%Clobetasol Propionate .05%Those three products have collective TAM of 76.8MM. Competitors by product are as follows:Desonide Lotion 0.05% - 3Triamcinolone Acetonide 1% - 9Clobetasol Propionate .05% - 3If I do the math to calculate TLGT's 'fair share' for each product it works out to about 4MM per quarter. Given Jason's repeated guidance for very moderate price erosion in the core portfolio & TLGT's history of front loading revenue when ramping new products...seems like that guidance is an easy UPOD.I'm expecting 16.5MM to 17.25MM rev in the 4q."

"Acthar has made the news for other reasons. Acthar was the subject of a 60 Minutes story on rising drug prices. Rising drug prices are a serious issue facing our country and our patients. In Acthar’s case, it was first introduced to medicine in 1952 and had approval at that time to treat all steroid-responsive conditions. A true orphan drug, Sanofi ultimately decided to discontinue the drug because of lack of profit. Pediatric neurologists who felt Acthar was essential for treatment of infantile spasms appealed strongly to the FDA for a label and cost review in order to ensure its continued availability for their patients. Since acquiring Acthar, Mallinckrodt has made only modest price adjustments. Each vial is currently priced at $40,000."

We're coming up on 4 months since the application on the first injectable was submitted. I remember approval could come as early as that.

"TLGT share price erosion is just unbelievable. The now $41-42M market cap (at ~$0.76/share) does not make sense, but it could still go lower as the stock is in search of support. One has to look back to 2010 to see equivalent price levels.... Where is the bottom ? 0.75? 0.70? 0.65 ? Lower still to 0.5 ? 0.65 was a local bottom back in 2010. Not sure where this stops but the share price is definitely not reflective of where the business is/ is going, although it has not been for a while. It is, however, a market refection of market's perception of the management. I am adding at these levels, but I am shocked, though, that management has not yet stepped up to the plate yet with open market buys. GLTA."
"Teligent management should be stepping up and making open market purchases of TLGT stock at these depressed price levels. That would send a clear message to the markets. Let's see if there are any 4K filings this week or the next. Just sent a note to company IR to that effect. Needless to say, this cuts both ways and a lack of insider buys after this much of a haircut would be just as telling."
Does anyone know the status of the FDA reinspection? Did Teligent complete corrective actions? Likely that FDA will reinspect in Q3?
"I wonder if 3rd quarter earnings were mentioned in the placing of these bonds. As in, as a company we feel we've turned a corner, we just recently submitted our first application for an injectable product at our new facility. For Year 2019 we projected top line revenue growth of 10% and our 3rd quarter revenue is xxxx. That is why you should purchase these bonds."

Something like, ""We are substantially disappointed by our progress and somewhat embarrassed to share this year end information. Our numbers, and the fact we have not yet transformed our new building into a manufacturing and money-making center, is a pitiful expression of our need for greater effort and a unified approach.

I love you guys
Next positive catalyst for TLGT is more clarity on capital structure by end of September. That will remove MUCH market uncertainty. Look for that to be largely resolved in September.THEN 2h18 (3q?) we will see a major ANDA approval. Maybe $200MM complex product.THEN 2h18 (4q?) we will see another major ANDA approval. Probably $100MM 'orphan' injectable product.Sprinkled in an around those two there will be 5 or 6 other ANDA approvals.THEN we will get the FDA prior inspection approval of the new Buena facility.THEN in 2019 we will start to see strong margin improvemnt as Buena ramps.It's gonna be a good ride!
"we need volume. oh, and FDA updates"
We are back up to the strike price of Mr. Sawyers options.
"I know that people who are short will thumbs down but who cares. As an investor, the risk vs reward here is inviting. Right now TLGT trades around $1.00. We are waiting on FDA inspection and approval of the injection facility. I anticipate that management may need to correct a couple items but should have everything worked out and get approval before year end. Already TLGT has been hitting their earnings on the current approved products. Let's say that as a conservative estimate is a rally from $1.00 toward $1.75 area within a few days (maybe hours) after approval. Now let us reduce the $0.75 by half to $0.35, that would be an obvious 35% gain within 3 1/2 months. It is not difficult to be optimistic as the math is simple, especially for a company that has a 52 week high of $3.95."

"Since the appointment 6 weeks ago of the two new directors, the share price of Teligent has fallen 50%. Well done Mr Marth and Mr Pate, a fantastic start. Am sure this will look terrific on your resumes."
"Added shares to my budding long position, let's see if we can catch a bid. Risk on!"
"E-mail sent to IR (Mr. Finio)I guess I was looking for a similar PR as to the one you put out on April 12th, see below. And, of course, that statement was double down on in the first ER a month later. Share price was still above a dollar then and has since moved down almost another 50%. It seems Teligent set the precedent in addressing negative moment in the share price, and it may be time to do so again. The next ER is two months away, so I guess my question is....Is Teligent planning any sort of update regarding the facility, orphan drug, or revenue numbers prior to the next ER?Response-If there is news to share, we will certainly issue a press release. However, we do not plan to release revenue numbers prior to the next ER (our auditors (Deloitte) need to sign off on the earnings release which is a quarterly review process) and we have no intentions of reaffirming our full year guidance for a fourth time before the next ER (we issued the guidance in early March, reaffirmed it via press release in April, and re-affirmed it again on the May earnings call).He was very quick with his reply. Just a FYI"
Two individuals muted here.And Ernest R. De Paolantonio hired there.Wait and see continues.
The delay in earnings report may be that TLGT needs a decision on the orphan drug or approval on the plant to accurately and effectively provide guidance for 2020. The longer they wait the more likely it is they are to receive it. It may be as simple as that.

This is painful but the trend is positive.In 2018 they secured 125m of new financing and have an expanded, FDA-approved facility, key to expanding capacity to cover costs. Revenue needs to be around 105m to be profitable (assuming 45% GM, and SG&A/interest expense around 47m). They will need cash over the next 6 months, so there will be dilution but likely already priced in. The long-track record, revenues that grew 10x over ten years, a new credit facility and modern FDA-approved plant makes it likely it will get financed, implying over next 1-2 years the shareprice should be near 2018 high of over 4."
Just listened to the recording of the 11 minute annual shareholder meeting from yesterday. Everything passed. Not a single question was asked and there was no discussion of any of the issues the company is facing.

Any FDA updates please? or just dates?
"April 12th,“Teligent acknowledges that there have been significant negative movements in the value of our stock over the past many days. We are not aware of any fundamental news or change in the financial condition of the company that could justify the magnitude of these changes,” commented Jason Grenfell-Gardner, President and CEO of Teligent. “We continue to believe in the guidance that we have provided the market for 2019. This includes achieving double digit top line percentage growth with revenues in excess of $72.5 million, a consolidated gross margin above 40%, a consistent investment in R&D of $13 – 15 million, and an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 10% after adding back any foreign currency gains or losses and non-cash stock expenses.”“In addition, we have continued to advance our plan to start-up manufacturing of commercial product in our sterile injectable facility. We have recently confirmed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) an expedited review pathway for the first injectable drug that will trigger FDA inspection of the site. We are confident that this plan will allow us to commercialize product and recognize revenue at the earliest possible point,” continued Mr. Grenfell-Gardner.“To date in 2019, Teligent has received a 4 drug approvals and launched 4 new drugs. This has further bolstered our belief in the underlying economics of our business that supports our guidance for the year. We are grateful for the continued support of our shareholders during this dynamic time, and we look forward to sharing our results with you for the first quarter of 2019 in early May,” Mr. Grenfell-Gardner concluded.May 6thMr. Grenfell-Gardner remarked, “We continue to outpace the market in terms of ANDA approvals having received five to date already in 2019, which brings our total to 36 approved ANDAs from our internal development pipeline. And, as communicated previously, our response to the FDA’s complete response letter on our orphan drug application was submitted on April 16th.” Mr. Grenfell-Gardner continued, “In addition to achieving our 2019 financial guidance of double-digit top-line growth, gross margin greater than 40% and an adjusted EBITDA Margin greater than 10%, our entire organization is focused on preparing for the FDA’s prior approval inspection of our new injectable manufacturing facility.”""We remain confident in our business and look forward to launching our first injectable product out of our state-of-the-art expanded manufacturing facility in Buena, NJ before year end,” Mr. Grenfell-Gardner concluded.May 29th $.70 per shareNo comment."
Bottom line for me...it feels like they've at least held off bankruptcy and bought another year to attempt to get their multitude of issues resolved.
"responding to at_000 ... (well.. trying at least, as ya h oo keeps deleting my posts .... ) The short position is a hedge against the long convertibles notes position, in case the company goes belly up. That is obviously not happening and the convertible notes are now being extinguished . The only reason why the big short would still keep its massive short exposure would be if there is the opportunity for shares to go lower even further. To that end, consider then that TLGT share price, after this massive decline, corresponds to a market cap of ~$63M. Most recently Teligent guided annual revenue in the $66M-$68M range. The corresponding price to sales ratio currently stands at 0.94. (I use this indicator as TLGT is currently not profitable.) Consider also that Drugs/ Pharmaceuticals trade on average at a price-to-annual-sales ratio of 4 - 5, and that Drugs/ Biotech companies have this ratio around 7 (google price to sales ratio by industry sector to double check). Teligent is a generic pharma so I'll take the 4.00 ratio. In other words, compared to its peers, TLGT is by this metric about 4x undervalued and is in fact trading as if the revenue is just about to fall off a cliff and the company is under a major distress, whereas, based on all the recent S_E_C filings we know that all the uncertainty that one could say helped initiate the steep decline has been effectively resolved; that there is ample cash (new credit facility) available to service the company's obligations; that Teligent is hiring staff for the new facility in prep for production ramp up there; that ANDA approvals are coming, etc. etc. etc. And, we also know that insiders (including the CFO), thought the company was undervalued at price levels of 1.80, which is >50% higher from current price levels, and this was only 14 calendar days ago !! In short, based on all publicly available info and recent resolution of key financial issues the company had faced, it would seem safe to say that what we are seeing is a major price anomaly that just cannot last for too long. Could the price go even further down? Yes, sure. There are those who wanted it this low. But you can only stretch the rubber band so much before it smacks you right in the face.I think from here (1.0 - 1.2 range) we go sideways >> up, but it will be a long slog with ups and downs and TLGT management needs to prove itself again as they have clearly lost the trust of the Street (otherwise, it would not have been possible to manipulate the TLGT stock price this low). My 2c... and please take the above ""wisdom"" with a grain of salt, as unfortunately, I, too, am in a world of pain with Teligent. But I continue to add at these price levels though.GLTA"
"I know investors are required to disclose if they take a 10% stake in the company, but are there other thresholds where another disclosure is required (e.g 20%, 30%. etc.)? I wonder if Morgan Stanley continues to slowly accumulate shares."

"I'm puzzled. I just re-read the 3rd quarter conference call transcript. It seems to me that we are a much more mature, executing company with potential than it was 5 years ago when the price was wandering around $9. Approvals, a state of the art manufacturing facility, and a much larger portfolio on the market. I am cognizant of the old adage: ""never fall in love with a stock"". However, that being said, I believe we are under-pricedWhat am I missing?"

"Yahoo is calculating market cap at $18M which would clear the $15M hurdle to avoid de-listing, but I'm a little unclear as to how we got here. It wasn't long ago, at these prices, market cap was around $3M if I remember correctly. Does this have something to do with the resolution that passed? No new shares were issued. The only thing I can think of is, some of the bonds have a convertibility feature, does this count towards market cap? Seems like a stretch to me...."

"Results are disappointing like every quarter in the last 2 years. I hope I am wrong, but I think they will announce a new voting soon, because the recently approved 1 for 5 reverse split means less than 2 dollars currently. Most likely they need a 1 for 10 to keep the share price well above 1 dollar. Unfortunately I do not see the positive turnaround what I am waiting for..."
3 months ago this share price was unthinkable for me. Less than a half dollar from the delisting stopwatch starting.

New comer. Buy now or wait when it drops ? How high can this hit )
Looks as though TLGT is in a trading range until news regarding the injection site inspection. Positive news rockets the SP upwards to the $2-4 range though. Until then it looks as though the $.10-.20 moves up and down will be the trend. JMHO

"A reverse split is never a good sign in a company. Personally, I would like to see management shelve the reverse and if kicked off the Nasdaq just focus on getting the business back on track and relist at some point in the future in a stronger position. However, the more difficult path forward is hardest choice at the top of the company and it would take real leadership to choose that path. Therefore, I see a reverse split being implemented by the board because of the lack of leadership believing and expressing that they have a path forward to positive growth. Management always needs to take ownership and tell their story which is why TLGT is at $0.43 and TSLA is at $560. Elon Musk give the good, bad and everything in between but most of all he is a believe in his company's path forward even with high cash burn rates and still needing billions in funding. Leadership is what makes the difference. JMHO"

"It's time to anticipate how to digest earnings info by reviewing statements made from Q3.1. ""We now anticipate revenue for the year of between $65 million and $67 million and gross margin of 38% to 40%.""--Keep in mind this is already a significant reduction from their forecasts earlier in the year.2. ""As we look ahead to 2018, you will see a pronounced shift from investment mode to recognizing the benefits of the investment we have made. This is a key premise in our 2018 budgeting process to drive stronger cash flows in the business and to raise the bar on the required ROI for investment and is consistent with the plan that we had set out before embarking on this cycle of capital investment. Frankly, I think we all agree it's time to shift gears.""--2018 forecasts will be the major driver to share price. Their language ought to begin to be focused on profits.3. ""In addition to our focus on performance, we will also be working on our capital structure in 2018 to replace some parts of the existing debt structure with longer-dated commercial debt tied to our facilities and our working capital. We have a few ways we can do this, but I think the important message is that we will be active in managing our balance sheet exposures during the year.""--I believe this is extremely important and I hope they are pressed on the specifics. This will be a crucial driver to share price.4. They said ""No"" to share buybacks as the best way to utilize cash, even at these low share price levels. 5.On the building: ""We start all of our system testing in the month of December. We will do water system testing and validation starting in February, and the goal is to produce the first lots to support pre-approval inspection in the second quarter. And our goal would be to have product available in the market by the fourth quarter of 2018.""--It's a long road. I'll be listening closely to hear if they're still on it.I did send an email asking about when earnings will be announced. NSB"

"It's difficult to speculate what assets might be on the table for sale discussion.

"A few more points:1. Remember that the majority of the December 2019 convertible bonds were pushed out to May 2023. The remaining portion of the December 2019 bonds due, approximately $12.2M, will be extinguished with the final $10M available from Ares, and the remainder of approximately $2.2M will come out of operating cash flow.2. A VP for Quality and a VP of Operations came on board recently. 3. Over the next 24 months, incremental CapEx spending on the Injectable High Speed Filling Line will be between $15M and $20M.4. Before the High Speed Filling Line is online, the current injectable capacity is between 4M - 8M units. Jason was asked about current injectable revenue capacity and he indicated that 4M - 8M figure, identified revenue per vial to be somewhere between $4 - $6, and summarized that revenue capacity from the current injectable line is broadly between $20M and $40M.It's possible they'll squeak by without an offering.IMHO, NSB"

Teligent is up 7.11% to 0.41
Two years ago this was a $9 stock with big plans. In what specific ways have they failed?Analysts at one time liked the stock. Is part of the problem that big pharmaceuticals price matching generic manufacturers? Don’t know if I should hold on and hope for recovery.
hits a new low everyday. no support anywhere. This stock was $3.50 six months ago. They missed last earnings but not enough to justify a 75% reduction in its valuation.

"Just a reminder - Teligent 2nd QT 2018 update:“First, for the remainder of 2018, we now have 8 FDA ANDA submissions with GDUFA goal dates by year-end, with a total addressable market of $366 million based on recent IQVIA data. Given our current track record, we feel confident that we will continue to bat above average when it comes to converting these submissions into approvals and launch drugs. Second, one of the most exciting parts of that pipeline for us is the GDUFA goal date for our first orphan generic drug, which has a goal date in September this year and is currently under active review by FDA. We're already preparing for the launch of this product together with our partners in order to bring this alternative to patients as soon as possible post approval. Our complex orphan drug currently has a total addressable market of just over $100 million based on June IQVIA data, and we have filed for Competitive Generic Therapy status as part of our submission. We will continue to keep you up-to-date as we progress on this exciting project that could be transformational for Teligent. Third and finally, we are significantly ahead of plan on our injectable development programs, particularly for completely new developments rather than site transfers and post-approval change applications. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, our ability to turn these [development teams] fully over to our injectable plan will, I believe, continue to drive significant growth and profitability in the business. With this change in the horizon, we've been focusing on the second half profitability, cost control and growth. And I am incredibly encouraged by the results that we're seeing.”"

"So, no surprises. A slight decline in revenue compared to expectations. Forecasts affirmed for the year. Debt and cash burn reviewed, without an apparent need for an offering due to exercising deferred interest and a draw. They met the Q1 covenant compliance and seem confident they'll be able to do so for the rest of the year. Orphan drug info may be sooner than earlier thought (which was later than originally thought). FDA facility approval seems imminent this year, barring major mistakes. Cost-cutting is occurring, thwarted by $0.7M legal fees. All in all, no red flags and staying the course. I suspect some Ares employees own some stock at a buck a share, since a year from now it could easily be a multiple of that.I'm still holding through the year.IMHO, NSB"
"** Possible short squeeze in the making for TLGT **I received a call from my broker (a large financial institution) notifying me that TLGT may not be marginable after Aug 2. I asked why, considering that the company seems to be turning the corner business-wise and the stock is technically trading very well, following a string of good news (technically it is presently coiling and preparing to break through 200d EMA; there is a gap to be closed from the Nov 6 2017 bottom at 4.99 and a close at 5.25) .... and the broker said ""BECAUSE THE SECURITY IS VERY HARD TO BORROW"". I asked if this change would apply only to their financial institution or whether other brokerage firms would do the same, and the broker noted that while he could not speak for others, typically these things are industry wide.Interesting. So... why would anyone want to borrow a security ? Well.... to sell it short. Generally, for a security to be shorted, it has to be marginable. A quick look at the short interest (see shortsqueeze dot com) shows that we are looking at 18.6 days to cover with approx. 34% of the float is sold short !! That is massive.My two cents - While some investors who are long TLGT on margin may decide to sell some or all of TLGT in order meet maintenance calls (many will choose to bring in additional funds), most - if not all investors who are short TLGT will need to cover their shorts. With 34% of the float sold short, I think we are looking at the possibility of a massive short squeeze in TLGT. Thoughts ? Long TLGTGLTA."
"Some thoughts before Monday on 2018 full year and 2019 forecast:1. In terms of 2018, let's keep in mind Damian's statements during the Q3 earnings call--""...we expect full year revenues of $66 million to $68 million, which is short of the $70 million lower boundary of our previous guidance. We project gross margin at or 100 basis points below the lower boundary of our previous guidance of 35% to 40%. And we remain on track to invest $13 million to $15 million in R&D this year."" And ""...we are lowering our 2018 full year EBITDA guidance to a loss of $6 million to $8 million or adjusted for noncash foreign exchange losses incurred year-to-date, an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4 million to $6 million.""2. In terms of 2019 guidance (and delivery) TLGT has many moving parts making it difficult to quantify EBITDA: orphan drug, new operations in building, undefined sterile injectables, etc... 3. If 2019 guidance is difficult to reach during the year, TLGT has the option of spending less on R&D as well as deferring the interest payments. Because of these, I believe the 2019 guidance will be met or exceeded one way or the other.IMHO,NSB"

"Last year's first quarter earnings release was on May 7, 2018, so we're likely less than two weeks away from this year's. Unfortunately, we already have the main number. During the YE CC Damian stated this first quarter revenue would be 20% less than 2018 Q4, which was $16,777M. 80% of that revenue indicates a 2019 Q1 revenue of $13,422M, which is very poor. Here's the last few years' first quarter performance:2018 -- $14,5452017 -- $19,8912016 -- $15,657Interestingly, since the ramp up of revenue begins in the 2nd quarter and full year revenue has been reiterated in excess of $72.5M, this means TLGT is expecting 2019 Q3 and Q4 each to be substantially in the above $20M realm. That would elevate the stock price, as would positive information about injectables and the orphan drug by year's end.The biggest challenge I see is that their cash burn will be accelerated in this reduced revenue quarter. They ended 2018 with $9.7M in cash. The remaining $15 million of second lien term loans is available in 2019 for the manufacturing facility. I'm not sure how much revolving credit is available otherwise. I do wonder if enough cash is on hand for the next two quarters to fund operations adequately.IMHO,NSB"

The markets have rewarded TLGT stock with some upside based on new management and cleaning house. Check out new openings at the NJ facility either adding on more compliance help or they got rid of the contaminators which lead to the FDA warning. Hopefully we can get over a dollar before Nasdaq deadline and not do a reverse split prior to that. If new management can convince the markets that they are on the right path and making progress than I think we can. Example last week ASRT sold the NUCYNTRA franchise for 375 million and they would pay off there 373 million dollars in debt. ASRT stock was at 54 cents a couple of month ago and now is at 1.50. ASRT had more shares outstanding and was not ebita postive . So iASRT can do it so can TLGT especially if we get orphan drug approval and fda ok of the facility and stay ebita postive and sell off non core assets and pay off some debt!
"I see many comments about forward multiples on the stock price. IMO, the recent price and volume action is all noise. The presence of loud recent arrivals supports this. The fact of the matter is that TLGT needs to hit and remain around the $3 mark for the minimum market value threshold to continue to be listed. Of course, filing the quarter report is a given as well. We might get an indication of which way the wind is blowing by 11am Wednesday. GLTA, NSB"

"I received a response from Teligent's CFO Mr. Finio in Re: my inquiry as to whether the management team would be stepping up and buying TLGT stock at these depressed price levels. Mr. Finio noted he understood the point and the had passed the note along to the rest of the Management Team, adding that that those ""will be personal investment decision to make (outside of a black out period)."". Based on this response, it may well be that there is a black out period for insider trades until the delayed quarterly earnings have been formally filed. This can easily explain the absence of insider buys and the utter obliteration of the share price on overall low volumes, amplified by year-end tax-selling. I am gradually adding more to my position. I don't think these depressed levels can last for too long absent of course some really bad news disclosures in the next round of filings."
"I still hold my 5k shares. Teligent has too many products for the FDA to hold down. With a new facility, I have a strong hope that compliance will be met. Or maybe someone will buy them out."
My bet is there is some kind of merger or takeover being discussed. At the very least the non-core asset sale should be announced soon.
"as shareholders, just try to call the company and see if anyone from CFO or CEO calls you back. Ask them the questions. Good luck."
"The company announced they are holding a job fair on December 12, 2018 in Buena, NJ to fill some 30 open position at their new facility."

"Bank of America/ Merrill starts liking the generic sector again. See this morning analysts' note regarding TEVA (double-upgrade) and the generics sector. Bodes well for Teligent and resonates well with what Teligenet management has stated during the recent calls. Teva upgraded two notches to Buy from Underperform at BofA/MerrillBofA/Merrill analyst Jason Gerberry issued a double-upgrade on Teva to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $20 as part of his broader research note on the Phamaceuticals sector partially titled ""Preference for value, defensive + pipeline optionality"". The analyst says he is most ""constructive on US generic suppliers poised to benefit from stabilization of US generic pricing and a favorable year for new product launches"", forecasting the company to return to EBITDA growth after a trough year in 2020. Gerberry's view of pipeline optionality for Teva includes the ""upside potential from exclusive launches of generic Forteo and biosimilar Rituxan"", and the analyst is also positiv e on the company's ""top-flight management team"".

For me the main take away during yesterday's CC is that the after market sell off in TLGT shares was way overdone. To me the quarter looked ok. I'd entertained the notion that it could surprise to the upside...it didn't...but just the same the quarter was fine.Definitely not the type of quarter that would justify a 10%+ sell off.I think today's recovery supports that notion.
"This is literally my worst performing stock. And Monday's earnings report was at best depressing.Compensation raises. Why?Worse earning report than prior quarter and prior year. Write downs. Increased operating expenses. Lower revenues. Reduced research efforts and expenses.As a R&D company, they should increase research efforts and expenses before increasing money flow to other things.I'm holding a bag, but need realized tangible improvements before accumulating more."
"Well, earnings are less than pleasant again, and they blew through $13M since January 1. While the facility news and readiness is good, though expected, they just can't seem to increase their revenue, margins, and income. 3 month comparision yoy--$5M less in revenue even with the additional products, yet $400K higher cost of revenue? I'm getting weary of TLGT forever banking on future growth since it ought to have been partially realized by now. The CC is on my list. NSB"
why people sell it at this point?
I am looking forward to where this stock goes. Been hoping for a huge rebound for a long time! I think the time is coming soon.
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
"when the FDA letter approves this, matter of time, inevitable outcome, this goes to moon, i go buy me a Lambo :)"
Do you know what happens to a company with 60+ Drug products on the market and many more to come? This company will see a buy out at the same time it will explode with year after year revenue gains. Do your DD dont sell short.
"Mitigating Shortages of Injectable Drugs in the United States:The quantity of drugs in short supply in the US remains fairly high, with some shortages continuing for multiple years. The majority of these drugs are generic sterile injectable products most commonly in short supply due to manufacturing, i.e. quality, issues. Shortages can have significant consequences for patients and hospitals. CDMOs like Grifols Partnership, with excellent quality systems and the ability to rapidly transfer in sterile injectable manufacturing processes, can play a crucial role in the mitigation of drug shortages.Drug Shortages Lead to Real ConsequencesDrug shortages continue to pose a real challenge to public health in the US, despite a decline since 2010 in the number of new shortages occurring each year.1 According to a recent article in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, on June 26, 2017, there were 69 preparations of 28 emergency care preparations in short supply, including most forms of adenosine, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, dextrose, dopamine, epinephrine, fentanyl, labetalol, magnesium, and lorazepam, and an additional 50 large volume intravenous fluid preparations that were unavailable.2The majority of these drugs (72%) are sterile injectable products in a variety of disease indications, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs to cardiovascular and oncology treatments.3 They are most commonly in short supply due to manufacturing issues, which is apt to continue for multiple years.1 According to the US Government Accounting Office, since 2013, the majority of ongoing shortages in a given year were first reported at least two years earlier.1 Shortages of critical cancer therapies, drugs that provide parenteral nutrition and even basic drugs, such as intravenous saline solution, can delay or deny patients the crucial treatments they require, potentially leading to further medical complications and possibly death.4 For instance, at least one drug shortage (of norepinephrine) has been directly linked to increased patient deaths.5 In some cases when facing drug shortages, prescribers turn to second-line alternatives, which may be less effective or pose additional risks and typically carry higher costs.1,4Quality Is the Leading ProblemPreviously, as mentioned in the 2016 GAO report, the agency noted that many shortages of sterile injectable drugs were generally due to supply disruptions triggered by the slowing or halting of production by manufacturers in order to address quality problems.1 Quality issues were magnified by other features of the sterile injectables sector, including generally limited inventories, the need for regulatory approval, production complexity and constrained manufacturing capacities. In its 2016 study, GAO investigated more fully potential factors causing shortages of sterile anti-infective and cardiovascular injectable drugs.1 Notably, both the number of warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug manufacturers by FDA and shortages of drugs manufactured by the facilities receiving these warning letters increased from the 2007 fiscal year through the 2013 fiscal year..1 Overall, however, it was concluded that the issuance of warning letters was not a direct cause of drug shortages, because the facilities receiving the warning letters had histories of poor compliance and thus were facing ongoing quality issues. These issues persisted despite investments by the manufacturers to address the noted insufficiencies. Consequently, shortages of sterile injectable drugs will likely continue for some time.The study, conducted by the Pew Charitable Trusts and ISPE, also found that quality is a driver of drug shortages.3 Quality issues, in this case, were defined as “a combination of cGMP compliance violations and matters related to product development or manufacturing that led to lower-than expected product yields.” The researchers found that 45% of the reference products reviewed in the report suffered shortages due to quality issues. Problems with quality led to delays in regulatory approvals as well as delays in production and transfer from development to production, leading to reduced yields/quantities produced and withdrawal of products from the market. When there are quality or production problems for sterile injectables, the result is almost always a drug shortage. To minimize such shortages, an industry commitment to a culture of quality manufacturing is required.Raw Material Sourcing, Low Pricing and Other Factors Important TooIn addition to quality problems, there are a number of other factors that have been identified as contributing to shortages of sterile injectable drugs. GAO found the decreasing numbers of suppliers and the fierce competition and low pricing in the generic injectables market to be important issues.1 www.pharmasalmanac.com/articles/mitigating-shortages-of-injectable-drugs-in-the-united-states"

"2nd quarter questions: Is the plant going to get fda approval this month? I thought this quarter they said it would be done.Can they meet their revenue goals if the approval is delayed? I dont think so.If they do 17 million in the 2nd quarter,that leaves 42.5 million the last 2 quarters to meet guidance reiterated in April.How much cash is left? it sure seems the stock price indicates dilution coming.Was it possible to request an expedited response when the CRL letter was drafted? Do we do that?If the company doesnt do the revenue stated in the loan agreement, I'm not sure what happens,but it wont be pretty.Are we going to get an update on the full year revenues again? The stock price indicates no faith in Jason getting the numbers and his recent track record sucks#$%$ Jason if you cant get it done,its time to get someone who can."
"I check TLGT's website frequently. There was a woman on the Management Team, out of Astonia I believe, that is no longer there. I didn't see a press release for her departure, but maybe she wasn't at a level that required one. Finio's position has not been filled. Yesterday there were no available positions, today there are 11. I don't know what any of this means, if anything at all. Thank you."
The resolution passed.http://www.investors.teligent.com/node/12476/html
"Maybe like last year, a day late ...on 1. April preventing them due to SEC rules, from diluting and financing with new shares. Probably a demand from the creditors."
"So let me get this straight, TLGT still has all their products and is almost or completely finished with the injection facility yet the stock price has fallen below $1.00 because a separate company is interested in some of their product line. If nothing changes then earnings should be close to on target with potential updates on the facility which could be either bullish or bearish (if delay). Just me but the current price doesn't seem to reflect the value here. I do like stocks at a discount though."
"With pharmaceutical production clearly coming back to the United States, Teligent will be a winner...thus the rising price"
"FDA news to come, that would skyrocket sp and renevue..=)"
"if the management failed to adequately respond to FDA, which is the case here, it's a big mistake/blunder from the management. may be this stock is worth what it is now or even less. I am stuck in this stock. I guess I overestimated the potential of this company in generic market. I wonder if they really have expertise in production? getting FDA approval for the plant is not a rocket science."
A failing company would not have 20+ job openings posted on there website …
It is about time to climb up
"If FDA inspection failed TLGT will do 20:1 R/S, this will happen very likely"

Very soon they will be getting FDA approval to open up their new plant and we all will be laughing that at one time we could pick this company up for $.58
That's mad volume
Anyone know what's going on? Has there been news?
Current situation:Received violation letter from FDAReceived delisting noticeReverse split proposedUnmanageable debtConsidering the current situation no buyer for part of business as planned by management.Expected outcome:Reverse split conducted which will bring the SP down at least by 35%Further dilution to raise capital which will bring the SP further down by 15-20%Delay in injectable approval due to all pending violation bring the SP further down. All in all the shareholders are expected to loose at 50-55% of value.Simply put very BAD investment.
"Just incredible how much selling pressure there is on TLGT. Given the recent SEC filings and closing of new the financing agreement, plus insider buys earlier in the month (CFO + CSO) at now significantly higher levels (their buys were at @1.80, approx. 50% higher vs. current selling price of 1.21), I can only ascribe the ongoing selling to year-end tax harvesting. I am continuing to add to my TLGT position (though admittedly I am not one bit happy about it all)."
TLGT is a rapidly growing micro-cap specialty generic manufacturer with 200%+ upside potential over the next 12-18 months. The company has a significant revenue opportunity with an upcoming approval decision on their orphan drug opportunity with a $100M+ IQVIA market value. The upcoming inspection/approval of their new sterile injection facility should be a strong value creator as the company focuses more on higher margin injectables moving forward. Consensus estimates are expecting an average annual 3-year sales growth rate north of 25% with EBITDA growth rates expected to grow more than 130%/year.
My average is 0.9 
"On Benzinga last year...What is the target price for Teligent (TLGT)?AThe latest price target for Teligent (NASDAQ: TLGT) was reported by Craig-Hallum on August 20, 2020. The analyst firm set a price target for $2.00 expecting TLGT to rise to within 12 months (a possible 355.68% upside). 1 analyst firms have reported ratings in the last year.Let's see if it's true.

"Company/ CEO public release that went out at around 15:00 EST todayTeligent says not aware of any fundamental news to account for stock weaknessTeligent President and CEO Jason Grenfell-Gardner provided the following commentary on the recent market movements in the price of the company's stock: ""Teligent acknowledges that there have been significant negative movements in the value of our stock over the past many days. We are not aware of any fundamental news or change in the financial condition of the company that could justify the magnitude of these changes. We continue to believe in the guidance that we have provided the market for 2019. This includes achieving double digit top line percentage growth with revenues in excess of $72.5M, a consolidated gross margin above 40%, a consistent investment in R&D of $13M-$1 5M, and an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 10% after adding back any foreign currency gains or losses and non-cash stock expenses. In addition, we have continued to advance our plan to start-up manufacturing of commercial product in our sterile injectable facility. We have recently confirmed with the United States Food and Drug Administration an expedited review pathway for the first injectable drug that will trigger FDA inspection of the site. We are confident that this plan will allow us to commercialize product and recognize revenue at the earliest possible point. To date in 2019, Teligent has received a 4 drug approvals and launched 4 new drugs. This has further bolstered our belief in the underlying economics of our business that supports our guidance for the year. We are grateful for the continued support of our shareholders during this dynamic time, and we look forward to sharing our results with you for the first quarter of 2019 in early May."" : from the f ly on th e wa ll dot co m"

"I'm surprised by today's lack of upward movement. The year's guidance was reaffirmed, twice I believe, by JGG and the CFO. This is with 5 month's left in the year, nothing is guaranteed, but 2 quarters are in the books. ANDA on the injectable to be submitted by the end of 3rd quarter and possibly FDA approval by end of year. The orphan drug application out in the lurch, appears as if TLGT is riding shotgun on this one. But if all of these things happen, 2020 could be a strong year and hopefully the share price recovers. I purchased yesterday and this again this morning. GLTA"
