"I received a response from Teligent's CFO Mr. Finio in Re: my inquiry as to whether the management team would be stepping up and buying TLGT stock at these depressed price levels. Mr. Finio noted he understood the point and the had passed the note along to the rest of the Management Team, adding that that those ""will be personal investment decision to make (outside of a black out period)."". Based on this response, it may well be that there is a black out period for insider trades until the delayed quarterly earnings have been formally filed. This can easily explain the absence of insider buys and the utter obliteration of the share price on overall low volumes, amplified by year-end tax-selling. I am gradually adding more to my position. I don't think these depressed levels can last for too long absent of course some really bad news disclosures in the next round of filings."
Added shares to my long position; risk on.
Just the fact that it is over a dollar now allows restrictions to be lifted on a lot of institutional investors watch the volume today.
This stock is done . I sold all my shares minutes before closing last Friday. I was in at .17 and sold a bit higher. No loss

"** Possible short squeeze in the making for TLGT **I received a call from my broker (a large financial institution) notifying me that TLGT may not be marginable after Aug 2. I asked why, considering that the company seems to be turning the corner business-wise and the stock is technically trading very well, following a string of good news (technically it is presently coiling and preparing to break through 200d EMA; there is a gap to be closed from the Nov 6 2017 bottom at 4.99 and a close at 5.25) .... and the broker said ""BECAUSE THE SECURITY IS VERY HARD TO BORROW"". I asked if this change would apply only to their financial institution or whether other brokerage firms would do the same, and the broker noted that while he could not speak for others, typically these things are industry wide.Interesting. So... why would anyone want to borrow a security ? Well.... to sell it short. Generally, for a security to be shorted, it has to be marginable. A quick look at the short interest (see shortsqueeze dot com) shows that we are looking at 18.6 days to cover with approx. 34% of the float is sold short !! That is massive.My two cents - While some investors who are long TLGT on margin may decide to sell some or all of TLGT in order meet maintenance calls (many will choose to bring in additional funds), most - if not all investors who are short TLGT will need to cover their shorts. With 34% of the float sold short, I think we are looking at the possibility of a massive short squeeze in TLGT. Thoughts ? Long TLGTGLTA."

April will be one year below $1. The “something good” needs to happen soon. I don’t want to see the reverse split vs delisting scenario. Patience is tough when you have deadlines.
"This is literally my worst performing stock. And Monday's earnings report was at best depressing.Compensation raises. Why?Worse earning report than prior quarter and prior year. Write downs.

"Mitigating Shortages of Injectable Drugs in the United States:The quantity of drugs in short supply in the US remains fairly high, with some shortages continuing for multiple years. The majority of these drugs are generic sterile injectable products most commonly in short supply due to manufacturing, i.e. quality, issues. Shortages can have significant consequences for patients and hospitals. CDMOs like Grifols Partnership, with excellent quality systems and the ability to rapidly transfer in sterile injectable manufacturing processes, can play a crucial role in the mitigation of drug shortages.Drug Shortages Lead to Real ConsequencesDrug shortages continue to pose a real challenge to public health in the US, despite a decline since 2010 in the number of new shortages occurring each year.1 According to a recent article in the Journal of Emergency Medicine, on June 26, 2017, there were 69 preparations of 28 emergency care preparations in short supply, including most forms of adenosine, atropine, bicarbonate, calcium, dextrose, dopamine, epinephrine, fentanyl, labetalol, magnesium, and lorazepam, and an additional 50 large volume intravenous fluid preparations that were unavailable.2The majority of these drugs (72%) are sterile injectable products in a variety of disease indications, including anti-infective and anesthetic drugs to cardiovascular and oncology treatments.3 They are most commonly in short supply due to manufacturing issues, which is apt to continue for multiple years.1 According to the US Government Accounting Office, since 2013, the majority of ongoing shortages in a given year were first reported at least two years earlier.1 Shortages of critical cancer therapies, drugs that provide parenteral nutrition and even basic drugs, such as intravenous saline solution, can delay or deny patients the crucial treatments they require, potentially leading to further medical complications and possibly death.4 For instance, at least one drug shortage (of norepinephrine) has been directly linked to increased patient deaths.5 In some cases when facing drug shortages, prescribers turn to second-line alternatives, which may be less effective or pose additional risks and typically carry higher costs.1,4Quality Is the Leading ProblemPreviously, as mentioned in the 2016 GAO report, the agency noted that many shortages of sterile injectable drugs were generally due to supply disruptions triggered by the slowing or halting of production by manufacturers in order to address quality problems.1 Quality issues were magnified by other features of the sterile injectables sector, including generally limited inventories, the need for regulatory approval, production complexity and constrained manufacturing capacities. In its 2016 study, GAO investigated more fully potential factors causing shortages of sterile anti-infective and cardiovascular injectable drugs.1 Notably, both the number of warning letters issued to sterile injectable drug manufacturers by FDA and shortages of drugs manufactured by the facilities receiving these warning letters increased from the 2007 fiscal year through the 2013 fiscal year..1 Overall, however, it was concluded that the issuance of warning letters was not a direct cause of drug shortages, because the facilities receiving the warning letters had histories of poor compliance and thus were facing ongoing quality issues. These issues persisted despite investments by the manufacturers to address the noted insufficiencies. Consequently, shortages of sterile injectable drugs will likely continue for some time.The study, conducted by the Pew Charitable Trusts and ISPE, also found that quality is a driver of drug shortages.3 Quality issues, in this case, were defined as “a combination of cGMP compliance violations and matters related to product development or manufacturing that led to lower-than expected product yields.” The researchers found that 45% of the reference products reviewed in the report suffered shortages due to quality issues. Problems with quality led to delays in regulatory approvals as well as delays in production and transfer from development to production, leading to reduced yields/quantities produced and withdrawal of products from the market. When there are quality or production problems for sterile injectables, the result is almost always a drug shortage. To minimize such shortages, an industry commitment to a culture of quality manufacturing is required.Raw Material Sourcing, Low Pricing and Other Factors Important TooIn addition to quality problems, there are a number of other factors that have been identified as contributing to shortages of sterile injectable drugs. GAO found the decreasing numbers of suppliers and the fierce competition and low pricing in the generic injectables market to be important issues.1 www.pharmasalmanac.com/articles/mitigating-shortages-of-injectable-drugs-in-the-united-states"
"Pink sheets as of Monday. I bought lots of shares ,,,"
I'm still here and still vested. Still buying more at these prices.
I have been in this since last year this kind of jump is new. What’s the news here?
Added a few shares today to what I consider a solid base forming on the 1 year weekly chart. We are in the early inning of a beautiful turn around story for TLGT. (Imho) Good luck to my fellow longs and enjoy this wonderful Labor Day Weekend.
Why can’t I buy this stock?
"Acthar has made the news for other reasons. Acthar was the subject of a 60 Minutes story on rising drug prices. Rising drug prices are a serious issue facing our country and our patients. In Acthar’s case, it was first introduced to medicine in 1952 and had approval at that time to treat all steroid-responsive conditions. A true orphan drug, Sanofi ultimately decided to discontinue the drug because of lack of profit. Pediatric neurologists who felt Acthar was essential for treatment of infantile spasms appealed strongly to the FDA for a label and cost review in order to ensure its continued availability for their patients. Since acquiring Acthar, Mallinckrodt has made only modest price adjustments. Each vial is currently priced at $40,000."
Just listened to the recording of the 11 minute annual shareholder meeting from yesterday. Everything passed. Not a single question was asked and there was no discussion of any of the issues the company is facing.

When's the reverse split?
I'm sorry but companies don't go from $4.52 a share to 48 cents a share in less than a year without horrible nail in coffin news. Some one thinks this company is going out of business. Typically when a CEO reiterates guidance after a selloff the stock comes back. This CEO did that when the stock was above $1.00 so it's lost another 50% since. There are numerous companies in actual bankruptcy that have a higher multiple than TGLT. Something illegal is going on here.
"E-mail sent to IR (Mr. Finio)I guess I was looking for a similar PR as to the one you put out on April 12th, see below. And, of course, that statement was double down on in the first ER a month later. Share price was still above a dollar then and has since moved down almost another 50%. It seems Teligent set the precedent in addressing negative moment in the share price, and it may be time to do so again. The next ER is two months away, so I guess my question is....Is Teligent planning any sort of update regarding the facility, orphan drug, or revenue numbers prior to the next ER?Response-If there is news to share, we will certainly issue a press release. However, we do not plan to release revenue numbers prior to the next ER (our auditors (Deloitte) need to sign off on the earnings release which is a quarterly review process) and we have no intentions of reaffirming our full year guidance for a fourth time before the next ER (we issued the guidance in early March, reaffirmed it via press release in April, and re-affirmed it again on the May earnings call).He was very quick with his reply. Just a FYI"
Is there any chance for this stock to rise again ? Or get some some money after the sale takes place ? Anybody knows ?
"This is my lucky charm right here. This will blow up soon, one day it will just pop to 10$+ a share and i will be there from 40 cents. LETS GO"

"A very well reasoned article on TLGT on seeking alpha; lays out key financial risks including the risk of BK that have contributed to the decline in share price, but also paints a bullish picture based on business turnaround, which has arguably already started as evidenced in the most recent quarterly earnings conf. call and the 10Q quarterly report released yesterday. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4282708-teligent-micro-cap-specialty-generic-company-several-significant-catalysts-drive-substantial?app=1"
Looking good even it's crawling up slowly at least it's going up. Thinking of buying more once I sold some of my stock from other pharma company.
what a beautiful stock..do you think we can reach 2$ soon?
"not sure why people on this forum are trashing mgmt. i thought earnings call was fine. there is only so much he can say since fda is still auditing. the fact that he was conservative makes me think it is going well and good news coming. remember last year he was very optimistic and it failed. human psychology duh ! if u got pocket nuts on the flop u better keep that smile down and wait for suckers to bet in…. i think good news is coming soon, thats my 2 cents. if i am wrong it will be a painful mistake"
I am new to this stock. I noticed that Yahoo Finance is listing an analyst target of $20. Is that correct?
$81M in volume and $18M cap. Am I missing something
6 days ago bought shares. Today averaged down and multiplied position x 5 . In my opinion they will be just fine in long run.
MM closed that pesky gap(woo-hoo); added a few shares to my budding long position. If you got stopped out thanks for adding liquidity to the market.
"In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. I'm pretty sure the FDA has laid out exactly what TLGT need to do to be in compliance, and that the 146 employees are busting their #$%$ daily to get the facility to said compliance. Jmho."
468% increase in inside purchasing on Friday...enough said.
"So let me get this straight, TLGT still has all their products and is almost or completely finished with the injection facility yet the stock price has fallen below $1.00 because a separate company is interested in some of their product line. If nothing changes then earnings should be close to on target with potential updates on the facility which could be either bullish or bearish (if delay). Just me but the current price doesn't seem to reflect the value here. I do like stocks at a discount though."
Come on TLGT
Does anyone here read the news updates. This stock has filed Chapter 11 & is looking to delist as early as Monday October 18th
33 job postings for TLGT up from 23 the last time I checked. (Just saying)
Is this Chapter 11 news real?
The markets have rewarded TLGT stock with some upside based on new management and cleaning house. Check out new openings at the NJ facility either adding on more compliance help or they got rid of the contaminators which lead to the FDA warning. Hopefully we can get over a dollar before Nasdaq deadline and not do a reverse split prior to that. If new management can convince the markets that they are on the right path and making progress than I think we can. Example last week ASRT sold the NUCYNTRA franchise for 375 million and they would pay off there 373 million dollars in debt. ASRT stock was at 54 cents a couple of month ago and now is at 1.50. ASRT had more shares outstanding and was not ebita postive . So iASRT can do it so can TLGT especially if we get orphan drug approval and fda ok of the facility and stay ebita postive and sell off non core assets and pay off some debt!
From 38 cents to 40 cents...interesting.
"Results are disappointing like every quarter in the last 2 years. I hope I am wrong, but I think they will announce a new voting soon, because the recently approved 1 for 5 reverse split means less than 2 dollars currently. Most likely they need a 1 for 10 to keep the share price well above 1 dollar. Unfortunately I do not see the positive turnaround what I am waiting for..."

"responding to at_000 ... (well.. trying at least, as ya h oo keeps deleting my posts .... ) The short position is a hedge against the long convertibles notes position, in case the company goes belly up. That is obviously not happening and the convertible notes are now being extinguished . The only reason why the big short would still keep its massive short exposure would be if there is the opportunity for shares to go lower even further. To that end, consider then that TLGT share price, after this massive decline, corresponds to a market cap of ~$63M. Most recently Teligent guided annual revenue in the $66M-$68M range. The corresponding price to sales ratio currently stands at 0.94. (I use this indicator as TLGT is currently not profitable.) Consider also that Drugs/ Pharmaceuticals trade on average at a price-to-annual-sales ratio of 4 - 5, and that Drugs/ Biotech companies have this ratio around 7 (google price to sales ratio by industry sector to double check). Teligent is a generic pharma so I'll take the 4.00 ratio. In other words, compared to its peers, TLGT is by this metric about 4x undervalued and is in fact trading as if the revenue is just about to fall off a cliff and the company is under a major distress, whereas, based on all the recent S_E_C filings we know that all the uncertainty that one could say helped initiate the steep decline has been effectively resolved; that there is ample cash (new credit facility) available to service the company's obligations; that Teligent is hiring staff for the new facility in prep for production ramp up there; that ANDA approvals are coming, etc. etc. etc. And, we also know that insiders (including the CFO), thought the company was undervalued at price levels of 1.80, which is >50% higher from current price levels, and this was only 14 calendar days ago !! In short, based on all publicly available info and recent resolution of key financial issues the company had faced, it would seem safe to say that what we are seeing is a major price anomaly that just cannot last for too long. Could the price go even further down? Yes, sure. There are those who wanted it this low. But you can only stretch the rubber band so much before it smacks you right in the face.I think from here (1.0 - 1.2 range) we go sideways >> up, but it will be a long slog with ups and downs and TLGT management needs to prove itself again as they have clearly lost the trust of the Street (otherwise, it would not have been possible to manipulate the TLGT stock price this low). My 2c... and please take the above ""wisdom"" with a grain of salt, as unfortunately, I, too, am in a world of pain with Teligent. But I continue to add at these price levels though.GLTA"
Attention management. Sell the company. Period
"I am a veteran and one of the creams Teligent has is Desonide. This is used for skin diseases which i use. So I'm in Long hoping they can get all the products back in the market. Between now and re-inspection expect the stock to be played with. Also, yesterday I asked Benzinga to try and get $TLGT to do a powerhour and they gave me a thumbs up through DM so im hoping that's an ""attempt"" response."
Sale could release enough to pay back bond holders and give stock holders back way back more than what the stock is trading at) Buy.

"we have provided the market for 2019. This includes achieving double digit top line percentage growth with revenues in excess of $72.5 million, a consolidated gross margin above 40%, a consistent investment in R&D of $13 – 15 million, and an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 10% after adding back any foreign currency gains or losses and non-cash stock expenses.”“In addition, we have continued to advance our plan to start-up manufacturing of commercial product in our sterile injectable facility. We have recently confirmed with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) an expedited review pathway for the first injectable drug that will trigger FDA inspection of the site. We are confident that this plan will allow us to commercialize product and recognize revenue at the earliest possible point,” continued Mr. Grenfell-Gardner."
Why is this doing this? So glad I didnt get out at .02. But the reality is that my cost is still .36. Anyone have any insight?
what the hell is wrong with this stock? i would think this is prime target for hedge fund or private equity to 10x
Does anyone have info on status of regulatory filing to prompt FDA re-inspection or clearance of the warning letter status? What is their communication with the FDA and what feedback are they getting from the FDA? Are they escalating discussions with FDA to get clearance? WHAT is their regulatory/compliance/upper management doing here??!! Teligent Board and Management need to address this
Everything depends on the sale price of the assets. There might be something left for the shareholders if they get a decent price.

"The 50%+ drop from April 30th-June 11th coincides with the failed inspections and Teligent's response letter, yet I cannot find any disclosure to the shareholders in this same time period. Someone told their friends.?"
Bottom line for me...it feels like they've at least held off bankruptcy and bought another year to attempt to get their multitude of issues resolved.

This is painful but the trend is positive.In 2018 they secured 125m of new financing and have an expanded, FDA-approved facility, key to expanding capacity to cover costs. Revenue needs to be around 105m to be profitable (assuming 45% GM, and SG&A/interest expense around 47m). They will need cash over the next 6 months, so there will be dilution but likely already priced in. The long-track record, revenues that grew 10x over ten years, a new credit facility and modern FDA-approved plant makes it likely it will get financed, implying over next 1-2 years the shareprice should be near 2018 high of over 4."
"This trading range just doesn't make any sense. Trading within a penny the day after an ER.?

Not even following the market. Can't figure it. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow."
"Good pipeline, FDA approval, and the stock continues on a downward spiral. Manipulation? Am I missing something?"
Next positive catalyst for TLGT is more clarity on capital structure by end of September. That will remove MUCH market uncertainty. Look for that to be largely resolved in September.THEN 2h18 (3q?) we will see a major ANDA approval. Maybe $200MM complex product.THEN 2h18 (4q?) we will see another major ANDA approval. Probably $100MM 'orphan' injectable product.Sprinkled in an around those two there will be 5 or 6 other ANDA approvals.THEN we will get the FDA prior inspection approval of the new Buena facility.THEN in 2019 we will start to see strong margin improvemnt as Buena ramps.It's gonna be a good ride!

This includes achieving double digit top line percentage growth with revenues in excess of $72.5M, a consolidated gross margin above 40%, a consistent investment in R&D of $13M-$1 5M, and an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 10% after adding back any foreign currency gains or losses and non-cash stock expenses. In addition, we have continued to advance our plan to start-up manufacturing of commercial product in our sterile injectable facility. We have recently confirmed with the United States Food and Drug Administration an expedited review pathway for the first injectable drug that will trigger FDA inspection of the site. We are confident that this plan will allow us to commercialize product and recognize revenue at the earliest possible point. To date in 2019, Teligent has received a 4 drug approvals and launched 4 new drugs. This has further bolstered our belief in the underlying economics of our business that supports our guidance for the year. We are grateful for the continued support of our shareholders during this dynamic time, and we look forward to sharing our results with you for the first quarter of 2019 in early May."" : from the f ly on th e wa ll dot co m"
"So, no surprises. A slight decline in revenue compared to expectations. Forecasts affirmed for the year. Debt and cash burn reviewed, without an apparent need for an offering due to exercising deferred interest and a draw. They met the Q1 covenant compliance and seem confident they'll be able to do so for the rest of the year. Orphan drug info may be sooner than earlier thought (which was later than originally thought). FDA facility approval seems imminent this year, barring major mistakes. Cost-cutting is occurring, thwarted by $0.7M legal fees. All in all, no red flags and staying the course. I suspect some Ares employees own some stock at a buck a share, since a year from now it could easily be a multiple of that.I'm still holding through the year.IMHO, NSB"
"Yahoo is calculating market cap at $18M which would clear the $15M hurdle to avoid de-listing, but I'm a little unclear as to how we got here. It wasn't long ago, at these prices, market cap was around $3M if I remember correctly. Does this have something to do with the resolution that passed? No new shares were issued. The only thing I can think of is, some of the bonds have a convertibility feature, does this count towards market cap? Seems like a stretch to me...."
"Per the Earnings Conference Call, TLGT was going to provide another response to the Warning Letter to the FDA in mid-September. With all the back and forth, it would be my guess and hope that some of the items on punch list have been completed. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge in this field to where the WL could be lifted based on their progress to date and with this next submission to FDA? I've heard the term ""consent decree"" thrown around in this context and would like to know if it is a possibility for our current situation. Thanks!"
Oh boy nevermind I’m out. Filing for bankruptcy no shares to short …
A failing company would not have 20+ job openings posted on there website …
Time to buy
Big partnership news coming!!!! BUY BUY BUY!
i am just speculating but maybe someone can chime in here tell me if i am wrong. the company has 9 jobs posted and the jobs being posted make me think the fda audit is going well and approval is imminent?? if this happens $ 2-3 like a rocket ???
Post ur losses folks
are we going to the moon or what??
"If the stock got delisted and become pink sheet , what platform or how I can sell all my shares? Ty guys."
They had some interesting insights about TLGT on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
i need a rocket
"Stock is rising because Portage is now calling the shots and Alyssa Luzynski, interim CFO, was with Deloitte M&A Transaction Services. Portage can make a big fee if they turn Teligent around and find a buyer."

"I still hold my 5k shares. Teligent has too many products for the FDA to hold down. With a new facility, I have a strong hope that compliance will be met. Or maybe someone will buy them out."
Another Titanic sinking jump out immediately or else you will struggle for a year or more to sell them
This company has actual products unlike many other pharmaceutical companies and good price to revenue. Can someone provide some insight why this down so much over the years?
"And now, in addition to the recent departure of JGG (CEO) and Wilson (Legal), James Gale is not seeking re-election to the Board. Strange and concerning."
Look at you all squirming now. “What do I do know sob sob”…. Read your posts from 4-6 days ago… You were all warned! It was common knowledge of the delisting today. I even had comments on my post saying “fake news” Is it so fake now?Do your research people.
"It's time to turn off the lights on the way out.And it didn't have to be this way, but a company can only take so many mistakes during so many years."
bought some shares yesterday and trying to forget about it for 0.5-1 year. May go to 0.15-0.2 $ or go bancrupt as well.
"Trade OTC Monday. As previously disclosed, on April 9, 2021, Teligent received a notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that its common stock failed to meet the minimum required closing bid price for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company did not regain compliance by the October 6, 2021 deadline and does not intend to appeal for additional time or a hearing. Teligent's shares of common stock are scheduled for delisting at the opening of business on October 18, 2021, and may thereafter trade in the over-the-counter market."
We're coming up on 4 months since the application on the first injectable was submitted. I remember approval could come as early as that.
Added a few shares to my budding position today. Glta
"Just incredible how much selling pressure there is on TLGT. Given the recent SEC filings and closing of new the financing agreement, plus insider buys earlier in the month (CFO + CSO) at now significantly higher levels (their buys were at @1.80, approx. 50% higher vs. current selling price of 1.21), I can only ascribe the ongoing selling to year-end tax harvesting. I am continuing to add to my TLGT position (though admittedly I am not one bit happy about it all)."
"Im staying in. I mean even with $100 its worth it. I still own 5k shares. Join Stocktwits Teligent for more convo. From StockMacro, ""With all this information and news, we project TLGT to be at $2.61 in 52 weeks compared to its current price $."""
Everything depends on the sale price of the assets. Shares might retain some value. Who knows?
When are we delisted? Little chance of reaching $1 anytime soon.
"Jason, as a long term stockholder I feel you should buy back shares (3yrs worth of your salary) and Tim, I know Jason left you a mess to clean up you should buy in 2yrs worth your salary. (Show your loyalty and hard work) and encourage all your high pay staff to buy in now. Show faith in CO."
"Added shares to my budding long position 99k+ and counting, this will be a beautiful turn around story. I'm betting on the 146 hard working employees to get the injectable facilities FDA approved. Jmho"
better not to trade until it successfully complete its Chapter 11 restructuring process and successful FDA reinspection. That is a scenario I expect and wait for

"Buy buy ,,, just like HERTZ"
I'm actually surprised by the gain. Glad to see it. I thought the share price would lose about 10% today.
I love you guys
"I'm surprised by today's lack of upward movement. The year's guidance was reaffirmed, twice I believe, by JGG and the CFO. This is with 5 month's left in the year, nothing is guaranteed, but 2 quarters are in the books. ANDA on the injectable to be submitted by the end of 3rd quarter and possibly FDA approval by end of year. The orphan drug application out in the lurch, appears as if TLGT is riding shotgun on this one. But if all of these things happen, 2020 could be a strong year and hopefully the share price recovers. I purchased yesterday and this again this morning. GLTA"
I am looking forward to where this stock goes. Been hoping for a huge rebound for a long time! I think the time is coming soon.
"The Company began a marketing process ahead of the Chapter 11 filing to determine the level of market interest and is in ongoing discussions with several interested parties. The Company expects to consummate a sale of the entire business or its core assets by early 2022. Meanwhile, Teligent's Canadian affiliate, Teligent Canada, will be pursuing an out-of-court sale process."
"From the earnings announcement, Sawyer begins by stating, ""We are pleased with the progress...""Just once I'd like a little different statement. They don't even have to be honest by saying they are going to squeeze every amount of debt they can refinance or through share issuance to share among management until it dies. But just once something different that shows reasonable outrage so I can know it matters and they are working, really working, to change things. Something like, ""We are substantially disappointed by our progress and somewhat embarrassed to share this year end information. Our numbers, and the fact we have not yet transformed our new building into a manufacturing and money-making center, is a pitiful expression of our need for greater effort and a unified approach. I apologize on behalf of overpaid management.""Ok, maybe that last sentence isn't required, but the rest would be nice to read.NSB"
"The price action on this is so bizarre...tiny little 100 share trades all day inching it up .0001 at at a time and then boom 16,710 shares all at once and it drops 3 cents."
"if the management failed to adequately respond to FDA, which is the case here, it's a big mistake/blunder from the management. may be this stock is worth what it is now or even less. I am stuck in this stock. I guess I overestimated the potential of this company in generic market. I wonder if they really have expertise in production? getting FDA approval for the plant is not a rocket science."
"Surely no one is thinking this is anything but a lost cause. I did well on this last year but seriously, it's over. BK11 don't lie"

"I'm puzzled. I just re-read the 3rd quarter conference call transcript. It seems to me that we are a much more mature, executing company with potential than it was 5 years ago when the price was wandering around $9. Approvals, a state of the art manufacturing facility, and a much larger portfolio on the market. I am cognizant of the old adage: ""never fall in love with a stock"". However, that being said, I believe we are under-pricedWhat am I missing?"
bankruptcy is inevitable
I hope the company has changed. I interviewed there several years ago and was not impressed.
Am i the only one laughing about these posts look guys and gals stop denying it please there is no coming back TLGT is finished it was finished months ago when we rejected there R/S Please don’t think this happened over night accept your losses and move on i did
The resolution passed.http://www.investors.teligent.com/node/12476/html
People were spooked by the recent news. I however thought that if another company is interested in purchasing part of their business then why wouldn't they entertain that offer.
"I wonder if 3rd quarter earnings were mentioned in the placing of these bonds. As in, as a company we feel we've turned a corner, we just recently submitted our first application for an injectable product at our new facility. For Year 2019 we projected top line revenue growth of 10% and our 3rd quarter revenue is xxxx. That is why you should purchase these bonds."

"When will it come back nasdaq, everyone?"
"The only thing that is going to move the share price is hitting the next revenue number. They have had too many misses and no one believes anything they say at this point. If they come in at 17 mill for this quarter and reiterate full year, we will go up, anything less, game over, for us and JGG."

"We know 3 things: Earnings for the qtr will at least $15 million, the injection facility has been built (any changes/improvements are being worked on), the first injection drug from the new facility has been submitted for approval. The company makes at least $60 million per year right now which is enough to manage debt, research and improvements. So bash away all you want...2020 will be very good."
