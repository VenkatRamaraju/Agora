"Looks like the pain is going all the way into the closing bell , I did not see this much of a drop today in my wildest imagination."
"""Top Ranked Momentum Stocks to Buy for August 4thZacks Equity Research August 04, 2021 Avis Budget Group, Inc. : This provider of car and truck rentals, car sharing, and ancillary services has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increasing 54.2% over the last 60 days.""Wow, what an advise. Did anyone follow follow through at the opening?"
"Bloomberg just released an article about a (used) car price collapse due to used vehicles not selling (due to the C19). That may explain something I saw 3 weeks ago. There is a huge fenced off parking area next to Wild Horse Pass Raceway (near Phoenix) that is crammed litterally inches bumper to bumper with thousands upon thousands of late model cars. The cars at the tail end of each row, I can see have license plates on them. only way to get to them is to move the 1st or last car out. Area where they are parked is at least as large as the AZ Cardinals stadium parking area. Holding area for used vehicles that are not selling? Affects rental resale."
Nice steady climb
"One of the analysts upgarde came from Jefferies. Incidently if you click the ""Holders"" tab, you will find that Jefferies Group Inc owns 2,754,182 shaes of $CAR. That is a fact, not a fiction."
lol somebody who bought CAR at $36 yesterday is already down 20% today. That’s like the same depreciation as buying a new car at the dealership. But at least you get to drive a car for your loss lol
"Reality sinks in slowly, but surely. There has been too much noises from different quarters including experts bolwing up this bubble. But it can only go so far."
Beautiful - will be red soon! The big reduction in fleet size and bookings will make this a much smaller company post covid and the SP will slowly reflect that
"Yes, the daily rate has gone up. But how many cars are left to rent and how many renters are showing up. The Canadian operation has tanked during the first quarter and continues so as the pandemic speeds up. There is absolutely no justification for the current valuation except for irrational speculation. Wait for the earning report."
"Insiders buy shares. Borrow money and buy back shares. The stock rises. They sell. Pocket the bounty. Retailers hold the bag. They wait. The cycle repeats. Nice business model. Why pack back debt, if they can make money LEGALLY this way?"
cashed out with a nice profit off a 5 week hold. will look at coming back when the market settles down; expecting probably in the mid 30's in the next couple weeks.
"@Chuck Car/Avis Cannot afford to buy back, that's why they'll probably go to a secondary offering to raise cash, not buy back. The world is evolving, hence Avis / Car in bed with ZipCar. They see the writing on the wall and need a different avenue to stay alive. Yes people will still travel and rent, but the numbers may never get back to where they were in the past. There are AI cars, gig drivers, Autopilot mini-buses coming out in the next (less than a year). The biggest profit margin for Avis is the INSURANCE and depreciation. What's going to happen if DOT gets bill passed to charge per mile for auto usage???? Two ways, pass cost on to consumer to stay even on the tax, which increases cost to the user / renter or Avis will absorb (NOT) With lessinsurance premiums being received, the Revenues and earnings will go up in the near term, but the NEW NORMAL of Green is going to be a huge cost to CAR. Biden will interrupt the rental business, just like the fossil fuel business, inflation, higher fed rates in 12 mos. or less. There is just so much that is leaning on this industry that is not good. There is a different Mental Mindset today and in years to come. Avis/ $CAR is THE NEW SEARS and you know what happened to them. IMO btw earlier post was 88.80"
"Laughable, but I will take it. Im selling this cant go much higher."
Anyone investing in a rental car company in the midst of a pandemic shouldn't be investing.
"AAPL is 148/share with $81 billion in revenue, and this is almost 95/share with 2.3 billion in revenue. So... what's in a share price?"
"I wonder why CAR traded 1.06 million shares Thursday after hours (10th most on the exchange https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/after-hours ) with no price fluctuation, anyone have an idea if there is some news about to hit? TJ is right about the 50 Zip Cars in Philly, but at least the news that has been issued recently has been positive in some manner. 2 million shorts covered last month, but still over 7 million out. I just found an analysis from Simply Wall Street ( https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-there-an-opportunity-with-avis-budget-group-inc.s-nasdaq%3Acar-30-undervaluation-2021-04 ) April 9th suggesting fair market value around $105 a share. I will be very interested in seeing if the major holders from December 30th have added to or sold any of their holdings when they update their SEC filings, especially SRS."
"Something fishy going on for sure, I might submit a SEC Tip / Complaint myself, lol.Very easy to do, takes 5 min."
CAR is expected to report 2nd Quarter earning in early August. Consensus estimate is approximately a loss of $4.0/Share. CAR is trying to running up before earning. Timing to short is best after earnings when it disappoints
Due for drop
"Southwest projects -75% revenue YoY for August and the same for September... just reminding everyone that the sky 'should be' falling for CAR. A reminder, 70% of their revenue comes from airports... which will most likely be only at 30% YoY for the rest of the year... GL to all, but beware of looming downgrades if the travel market doesn't improve before Christmas."
"Sorry, it about $CAR, not $ENB"
"From May through end of Dec 2020, SRS Capital filed 11 disclosures for acquisition of over 2.236 million shares of CAR. There are no filings for acquisitions in 2021, however Brian Choi, CFO, and Barnardo Hees, ""Executive Chairman"", disclosed purchases of 96,000 shares in 3 filings.I wonder how SRS chose the price/timing of its share purchases in 2020, and whether there was intent to manipulate the market. Curious ..."
There are two updates on $CAR this morning: * Avis Budget Group Inc : Deutsche Bank raises target price to $50 from $45* Avis Budget Group Inc : Jefferies raises price target to $55 from $46* Avis Budget Group Inc : JP Morgan cuts target price to $35 from $38Whom to believe?

"So let me get this straight. In 2019, which was a great travel year, they made $300 million.They now have reduced their fleet considerably, taking on more debt and thus more interest to come out of those earnings and travel won't return to 2019 levels until at least 2023....Ya makes sense that this company is worth over double what it was in 2019Total sense"
"Hey Razor , here is your chance to jump back in on CAR, don't know if we will ever see this level again. I think we are running out of good news for the covid reopening and will see a buy the rumor sell the news situation."
"CAR is reaching for any positive news. Do you really think the ""expansion"" of the Zip Car program with the City of Philadelphia, by an additional 50 cars, will have a material impact on the financial performance of CAR, or even Zip Car for that matter which CAR owns?"
Recovering nicely
Avis Budget is up 7.22% to 88.75
A very nice several days shorting and raising capital to buy Hertz.
Today's froth sure is interesting. Huge down day tomorrow?
notice that I have been quiet with my built up short position. Don't worry longs September will end and I will be gone by then. the question is will you save yourself before then
"I am legitimately excited for this week! The last time CAR behaved like this, on June 8th, it was followed by an enormous down day; and now, since it is suspected that this was mostly CAR buying back their own stock, I bet it's in preparation for selling by influential institutions/insiders. I seriously cannot wait."
Check out car rental prices on Maui right now. That should give you some indication of the cash that rental car companies will be making as this pandemic winds to a close. The airport code is OGG.
What's up with Zack's pumping CAR every day now?
Question: blow out earnings and now such a sell off? Is it just profit taking?
They will try to bait more shorts to climb aboard so the can continue to squeeze them and walk the price up higher. I've taken a small short position here but I have assured to keep it unsqueezable. No hard stop loss or large position on this one. I believe it will eventually fall back to earth and a fair valuation over time. The big boys love profits and they will take them when they have milked it for what it is worth.
Avis Budget is up 6.97% to 73.53
Keep in mind the analyst have lowered earnings projections so it should be easy for them to crush expectations which cause yet another pop. Something doesn't add up. Lowering projections at the same time your product and services are being touted by the media as being in high demand. It is all a game but appears to be really transparent with this one.
"52 WEEKS HIGH WAS $52 BEFORE PANDEMIC AND TODAY IS $72 .CHECK OUT THE VOLUME, I THINK ONLY 1 GUY BUYING AND PUMP IT ALL THE TIME. "
"Tomorrow I will be selling my Avis and jumping on Hertz, I remember Avis was under $10 same time around March 2020 where Hertz today"
where their is smoke their is a problem. I am in Cartagena Colombia the Avis and Budget are closed facts matter
"One insider of $CAR acquired 29,317 shares for nil ($0), and immediately sold 12,713 shares of it @$90.75 all on August 31, as per Form 4 of UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. It is called BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP. Great ownership."
I've been in and out twice with a short today. Made scalp money on both trips and now back in short again for the long haul. I managed to improve my overall long term short position and build a profit cushion to boot. I didn't see anything in the earnings release to justify such a lofty valuation so I'm sticking by my guns and suspect when the market corrects this will correct with it.
"On Friday, June 4, just before the weekend, the CAR Board authorized an increase of $325mm to their ""share-buy back program"", bringing the total funding for buy-backs to $391mm. Looks like the Company will pick up the slack from SRS, mgmt, to continue manipulating stock price higher. jmho"
Someone dumped 1m shares in 1 minute. She's going down!
"the manipulation is relative to CAR buying back stock on the dips, driving price up, to reveal a largerEarnings Per Share as the buy backs are treasury owned. Since 2016 the float went from 96M to now 68 Mwith most of those shares being bought back last March 20 - June 20, although they have most probably beenbuying to drive up price. In turn, it increases the EPS, book Value, and a reduced float (number of shares outstanding from the Company Treasury Stock (ownership). It is manipulation and you must prepare for a higher, or earnings beat on Monday. All Manipulation. Fundamentals haven't changed other than the ""PAY FOR RATINGS INCREASE WITH MOODYS ON 4/15, increasing the bond ratings. This is all indication of raising more capital either by a new bond offering, reduced rates to current bond holders, issuing new bonds secondary, or offering stock. Anyone's guess. My guess, they will report better numbers than last year, and with the way it has been going....there will be sellers next week as the stock is exuberantly overvalued and non-sustainable."
"Razor , I closed @ $83.30 premarket after seeing all the news about Rental car shortage and sky high rental fees . I still feel that Car is over valued ,but I know how the herd reacts to such news, plus we are close enough to earnings now that it will probably only go higher till after that ."
How you longs doing that bought at 30 earlier this month? Still holding? Adding? Time to get out before earnings disaster in July?
"Wow, it's still jumping.. 35 anyone.. It counldn't break much over 30, but bounced off of 29, so it seems There is still more up side... The FED is making sure we at least get some full v stocks out there and this might be one of those....don't follow reason, follow the money until you stop making any or if we get a full reversal today, Then, I'd short it on the bounces up. Otherwise buy the dips."
Long and Short - I am seeking your opinions on the 3rd quarter earnings. My thinking is CAR's earnings will deteriorate due to the emergence of new cases and further restrictions on travel. This will hit the earnings in a supposedly busy travelling period. Any thoughts. Is there any positive news that will support CAR for an upward price change?
i should have bought more on an after earnings dip that didn't make sense.
"Covered my 2,000 share short in $CAR today. Transferred all recovered capital to debt-free $HTZZ at 24$/share. Cheers!"
"How has Avis Budget Group performed over the past 5 years? Answer: -45.2%What is Last 1 Year Earnings Growth? Answer: -396.2%What is return on equity? Answer: CAR's liabilities exceed its assets, so it is difficult to calculate its Return on Equity. CAR has negative shareholder equity, which is a more serious situation than short term assets not covering short term liabilities.CAR has negative shareholder equity, which is a more serious situation than short term assets not covering long term liabilities.CAR's debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.The list goes on. But somehow, we should dream that $CAR will be profitable in 3 years, so share price must move up in advance. Sweet dreams may be good for the mind; may not be nice for the wallet."
Probably $79 finish today?It should be a $69 finish if things were true in this market and then down from there
Anyone else notice that the institutional holdings proportion has declined? It went from 97% (March - Yahoo) to 87% (Today - TDAmeritrade). Looks like the smart money is getting out.
Not a fan of projecting daily movement... thats like guessing the weather more than 24 hours out. BUT... if i apply my model to the short term (hourly) chart... this closes above $30 today... actual value is $30.72. This strategy only has a 56% success rate on a daily chart. Weekly... it has a 6 mo. 79% success rate. Monthly... 92%
BREAKING NEWS: AVIS $CAR JUST REPORTED EARNINGS. EARNINGS ARE BETTER THAN EXPECTED. OUTSTANDING COST SAVINGS NUMBERS ARE IN BILLIONS. ACCORDING TO ER THE WORST IS OVER. THE BUSINESS IS STABILIZING NOW. THIS IS MAJOR. LOAD LOAD AND HOLD. ONLY WAY UP FROM NOW ON
Nice day with more to follow. The cards are stacked against the recently purchased long position. if you got in under 45 your safe. if you got in the last 90 days my heart go out to you. I think we will slide under 70 by this week end. then this thing going to trade sideways till after earnings call. I know I not going to start to nibble long till it's under 55
I really like this company and how they managed to weather the first half of the storm of covid-19. But I am sorry this is over priced so I sold out today and shorted the stock cya at 55. this stock out performed Tesla in my portfolio
"Article in newspaper today --""Why your next rental car might cost more than a plane ticket""-gives story of a guy booking for Hawaii in July paying $1600 /week. The article states this is a widespread problem in USA and will get worse as more things open up. The next earnings report for CAR will be a blowout ! This extra cash flows straight to the bottom line."
I had been chasing this short for a year. And I still missed it. Congrats all who got it.
bought in at $10 back in April of 2020. took the profits today This stock is pretty much maxed out for now
"@Bill, much of it is via their ABS/SPVs... but it is important to continue to note the significant debt accumulation in this FY. Generally speaking, their interest exposure will consume any 'profit' for the next yr+. I'm still curious if there will be continued bond/debt downgrades that will actually #$%$ 'investors' in this equity... last senior debt offering was speculative with a spread of ~5% over investment grade senior debt at parity. So... the answer why it's trading at ~$33 is hard to find. If the fleet retains resale value above their projections, that will be helpful, but they'll continue to defleet and won't replace aging vehicles... leaving them more 'nimble' but significantly smaller with huge interest payments. Obviously I'm bearish, but this thing is defying all logic and just rising with the tide."
CAR is at $90 a share because:a. They wish to do a secondary offering at inflated prices.b. Institution/s want/s to unload at a profit.c. They are going to make $8 a share next year.d. Irrational exuberance from retail long momo players over the economy reopening trade.e. Insiders just want to cash in.f. All of the above except c.g. None of the above except c.
"Another all time record high for CAR. No news, no results, no volume, no problem "
This would already be at 80 if I didn't have puts in it.
Negative book value and $90 a share...Can't make this stuff up.
New all-time high! Gonna drop 20% tomorrow?
Them who bought Car after hours and pre market just tossed their breakfast.
"Take profits based on follows:- CAR stock price increase 100% over 7-month period, which is too much for car rental business. Let explore what are great behind it.- Institutional & Fund investors recently sold more than bought 9 million shares- Year-over-year data: Revenue is increased by 0.57%; EPS is decreased by 29.63%; BV = $4.92, D/E=35.24 (high debt), Capital Spending is decreased by $466 millions.- Many executives recently sold $40.77/share.- Holiday season is over; revenue, earning and stock price is generally down similar stock price performance Feb – Jun 2017. - Uber and Lyft are well growing. They shall take a portion market share of CAR."
"Have you seen the price of a rental car lately? It’s not long ago I could buy a good used car for what I now pay to rent one for a week. I rent cars often and the price is 3-4x 2 years ago. Of course Avis is going to make money - if they have a car available for you. Many locations have been requiring a 7-day minimum rental. I need a car for 3-4 days on a business trip so what choice do I have? Pay $1100 and keep the car (a Nissan Altima) for 3 days! How can Avis not make money right now? Never mind the resale value of used rental cars. The perfect storm seems to rain money for Avis. I’m glad I started buying an equivalent amount of Avis stock for the price of every rental I set. Oh, don’t cancel! Avis is now keeping the money. No refund for you! Don’t you know there’s a car shortage? You should know better than trying to cancel AND get a refund. The tables have turned."
"Bought CAR March 18th for $7, sold it a year and a day later for $67. I'm out. There might be more upside but I'm in the Black."
One of the few remaining bulls mentioned the price for renting in Maui. Just did a check on CAR and I could only book a week at a time. Budget-842.00 dollars for a week. Hertz-402 dollars. Who you go to? That was the last week of may.
still feeding the beast. $80 coming to a town near you.
"Well, I'll cover my short tommorow. Thought for sure this would go the other way after the run up this year. Live and learn. GLTA."
The news is ramping up their Covid hysteria.... people are starting to stay home and cancel vacations. Airline travel is dropping. CAR will drop big from here. Don't say you weren't warned.
"Just think last year on January 27th it closed at $32.50Since them they have issued more debt, sold cars reducing there inventory and thus revenue opportunity and gone through travel bans which aren't going away fully for some more months.How is this stock now worth $10 more per shareJust think about that....this is a market bubble no matter how you slice it"
Unless I’m wring here...Car has more of debt then Hertz? One is in the brinks of BK and this is all time high? What gives?
"All... -153M is the BV for common equity, that includes over 1B in Goodwill... This is trading on pure speculation that they will 'survive'. Remember, this is a relatively competitive space, CAR is a mid-major player, but Hertz will survive and Enterprise is 'fine'. Anyone long, keep a keen eye on forthcoming Manheim auction reports... anything below YoY gains tells you to get out before the sky falls..."
The word of the day. Delusions! I betting it's going to lead to the dilution of shares. It's a prime target with loses mounting up. perfect time to fund the company.
Sold my Puts today. Wouldn't be surprised if they spike the price tomorrow for options expiration.
"Sure, the ""Summer of Vax"" is upon us and I am concerned CAR is forming a Bull Pennant... but our society is different now - significantly reduced in-person meetings, increased personal car ownership, reduced new car availability, tons of new competition for CAR. Rental prices are approximately the same as they were a year ago, expedia giving free Avis rental credits... this baby's going down... increased my position today."
P-E of 32 vs 600 for some well know brands..
"Labor day behind us , National news waving the Covid Boogeymen in our faces , companies canceling in person meetings and going back to Zoom, but yet Car up today, there is no logic to this market ."
"People still buying Car even thou their season is over and by the time the next season arrives we could see a flood of new cars hit the market and more competition . There is no way Avis can keep charging what they have been for rates, something will give ."
"biz strategy: rent a car from one city and drop in another. avoid plane and covid. but don't rent out to shorts, let them walk."
Need to figure out what to buy with my 150% Avis gain....so many to chose from....that was a hard one for me. It was the first stock I ever bought.
$PLAY $CAKE $SEAS about ti breakout like $CAR - load up and hold up.. Still a bargain price here to get in - GLTA
Lets inject some realism into the conversation here since the clown squad is out in force today. Avis as a company has already come out in recent weeks to say they WILL NOT be going bankrupt. They had several quarters of earning/revenue beats and were in a much stronger position to weather this storm prior to Covid than other rental companies like Hertz (HTZ) were. Hertz was basically bankrupt before the pandemic ever hit. After reviewing all the data and talking with the company CEO and CFO we had Morgan Stanley upgrade Avis/Budget just last week. They will benefit from Hertz bankrupcy just like McDonald's would benefit if Taco Bell or Wendy's went bankrupt. Lets be real here.
Sold 25% of its fleet at a profit. Reduced fleet reduces their overhead. Car rentals are now 3x or more the price pre pandemic. Fully rented out with people having to wait for a car to be returned to get one. Add to that the value of their autos increasing due to chip shortage. This stock will continue to climb. $90 by the end of month.
"This was a good lesson that I've learned trading this stock.Although I did a pretty good technical and fundamental analysis, I failed to identify a key aspect that us, retail investors, have no chance to fight against. Supply and demand.$CAR has a total of 69.9 millions outstanding shares and a big 99.19% stake held by insiders and institutions (according to Yahoo). So, 0.81% (566k) are being traded. No wonder why the price jumps $1-2 in one minute and the bid-ask spread is $0.5-$1.5 and having such a small supply. I would be very cautious trading this stock again, but definitely remains on my watchlist. If this institutions decide to sell, the hell will break loose. ,, What goes up, must eventually come down"""
Avis market cap is up $600 million today aloneThat is the market we are in today....totally lost from reality
"If there is really this massive pent up demand Wall Street is selling, how does CAR capitalize on it with a substantially smaller fleet? I’ve owned this stock since it was part of Cendant. Remember them? Q1 2009 it bottomed at .36! Yes. Wish I had more money then. It made the same move to I think 69.25 and reversed to low 40s then 64 I think. Whipsawing all the way to a range of 21-middle 30s. By the way, they were profitable. Shares went from above 105m to where they are today. Instead of issuing shares, management issued more debt. I don’t like it. With less cars to rent the price per day is higher. Now Lyft and Uber become appealing. I would be more positive if shares were issued at this high valuation. I don’t think it stays here. Momentum investors will move to the next target. Most likely technology where semiconductors are in strong demand and the stocks are being drug down by the Tesla’s and the like. Yes I own semis, and am short against the box here. If you read these posts CAR leaders return some shares and get your money back with interest. -2.22 book value. Fix it."
it would be nice if avisbudget would buy some new trucks for the truck division. call always sold out - uhaul no problem.
Where did everyone go ?
$CAR-UN:CATarget Up CIBC World Markets Neutral CAD 65
"It's about to CARash. Going forward headwinds include: less vacationers after labor day, lower used car sale prices, labor shortages, less corp contracted travel due to delta (low rev/transaction anyway), high fuel costs, etc. IMHO you will see a 30-40% pullback over the next few weeks. $91 is not sustainable."
Avis a lot of debt. Hertz no debt> Avis soon bk
if she break's 80 I going back in and start to short her again
"I heard the news they are charging more for their rental. So I checked priceline at five different airports I travel to in the past. DCA, BWI, ect I still can rent a car for about 40 Usd a day. other then Hawaii which is third hand info where is the major price increases? Most of my travel destinations outside of the USA are almost in total lockdown. they let you outside Tues-Thursday during daylight hours only. who travels on vacation with these kinda restrictions?"
Paying off expensive debt with cheaper debt. No shareholder dilution!
"I’m curious why the only competitor talked about is Hertz? To me, and as a frequent business traveler, National is the best choice, but they don’t get mentioned in any of these (and other discussions). Is it because they are private and there just isn’t as much financial data on them?"
"made good money on this the last 6 months, but I did jump off to early last week. I wouldn't be surprised to see it back to 30 just after earnings."
it's cheaper for me to keep adding to my short position as is gone up. and pay the interest till the retail investor see this is a broken business model long term. I still think we got a 55 dollar per share company here. and that's given them allot of credit for the past actions of the management team. just look a the growth past 5 years comparison to stock price growth past 12 months
"Glad I topped up my short above $40, knew it wouldn't stay there long.Will start to cover some below $34GLTA to all that agreed that this had no business being above $35 a share"
"Wow, now that is a beat…."
Second quarter is going to be a disaster. No rentals for 3 months and after going into survival mode for months they've returned to fixing things to have rentable units to fill the void left by Hertz. It's going to be a big cash burn.
"Read the SEC filings when they get filed, they will still have NEGATIVE shareholder equity. Really that is all you need to know."
Lots of questions about impact from the htz bankruptcy. Will more renters choose car? Will htz fleet liquidation undermine car's lease collateral? What are the short term and long term implications. This will no doubt cause a lot of worry in this sector.
The ease of the this stock to rise on low volume and resistance to drop on even higher volume is quite strange.
"No reason for this to be green today, other than manipulation. Avis is gonna get caught in the crosshairs when used car prices crash."
"Ok , I gambled and bought a small position at $75 before the close, and going to see if it springs back a little tomorrow , so this short is temporarily a CAR long . I feel Car sold off way to much to fast today ."
"Fundamentals will matter after the next PR from Avis stating they are financially stressed and unable to make a debt payment. Or have a need to sell more common stock and dilute, or re-structure debt. It will happen and this game will be played in the teens or even single digits like HTZ."
"Wow! CAR out-of-court restructuring continues with financial engineering to replace existing debt due 2024/2025, with less expensive 4.75% senior notes due 2028. Kudos to management for living to fight another day. The piper will have to be paid. The question is when. Wonder how much debt HTZ will have as it exits bankruptcy?"
"Earnings Trend: CAR is unprofitable, and losses have increased over the past 5 years at a rate of 36.2% per year.Accelerating Growth: Unable to compare CAR's earnings growth over the past year to its 5-year average as it is currently unprofitableEarnings vs Industry: CAR is unprofitable, making it difficult to compare its past year earnings growth to the Transportation industry (11.5%).High ROE: CAR's liabilities exceed its assets, so it is difficult to calculate its Return on EquityYet, longs are not convinced. France is now in lockdown. Canadian provinces are going to be in lockdown. Europe is in a mess. Yet, $CAR is on high gear. Watch the ditch."
"okay what am I missing 1, the company loses money,2, they cut expenses sell almost a third of the fleet 3, insiders exercise options 4, company barrow mass amount of money. 5 use the money to buy back stock. I am looking for answers. I can understand when you making money and you see low stock price and no opportunity for investment in growth you buy your stock back. feel free to comment. I looked at every earnings report for the last 2 years in detail. Covid-19 was not their fault but before covid-19 they had a poor profit margin. now they are 33% smaller 2 plus times money owed granted at about 66% the interest rate. and the stock is up 200%. All I know is less shares mean higher loss per share. just like of they made money it would be more per share."
"Everyone should look at the investor presentation... some high/low lights (depending on long/short)...- Only accounting for 2% relative drop in resale value in the fleet before they hit equity cushion. - No explanation of projection (maybe on the call) of positive EBITDA for 3Q (presume increase in travel). - Hinted at aging fleet impacts, but only glosses over it.- Claimed 1.8B in revolving credit, but no terms. Again, not saying it won't survive... but on very, very shaky ground. Bond downgrades or Manheim value drops will sink this..."
$91 is crazy high. Billions of debt. Travel industry on decline due to rapid covid spread. Suspended business travel. Used car prices slowly easing. Holders should take notice and be cautious. Hertz $16 after bk reorganization. It's going to be an interested few weeks.
Mid month Manheim report says used car prices 'slowing'... makes sense as stimulus is expended. perhaps the real pain hits in October after the resale market adjusts and seasonal travel slows...
"avis acquired over 80,000 new cars in Q2 and is thus making a profit. for me the result has no meaning at all. the truth is in the balance sheets. avis is such a highly indebted company and it is becoming more and more in debt. you don't have to be surprised that the price collapses so badly"
CAR is one of the most debt ridden overvalued stocks in the market. Definitely not trading on fundamentals.
"Hertz will be off the Pink Sheets tomorrow. How much will Avis dive? I'm betting 10% cumulative by Friday. If it doesnt do at least 2% tomorrow, I'll just cover and buy Hertz regardless."
"Did you see that Moody's upgraded Avis debt tonight? Hold on to your hats, another piece of positive news and should give more upward push to trading Thursday. Have to laugh at Bill trying to start rumors about investigations; he must be getting clobbered in his short position. When the sec filings are competed for Q1, my guess is SRS has added a lot to their position and there may be a bidding war to take Avis/Budget/Payless private. Anyone remember Thrifty starting at $20 and going to around $95 a few years ago? Charlie is on a roll here."
The stock price is 10% higher than it has EVER beenDuring a pandemicAfter adding large amount of debtAfter selling off a chunk of its fleetStill no sight line on revenues this yearGoing to still be travel restrictions for the foreseeable futureBut yet the company share price is at $74 when the past peak was $67 back in 2014Are things REALLY that good right now. It amazes me the number of investors that are all in on reopening stocks
"Yes Avis had a great summer with unbelievable rates but with fewer cars to rent, and was the amount of money they made this summer anywhere enough o make up for the big loss to income they had during that long dry spell during covid lock down ? These are the questions a real investor with a logical brain should be asking ."
"MS upgrade b/c he thinks fleet disposition will be higher than expected. I don't think he realizes how many used cars will be on the market - people who lost their job - kids and younger folks who levered up to the max won't be able to afford payments - Turo app has massive used cars with people pay high lease rates - massive EV models coming to market - I can't see how used cars won't sell for more than 15% below bluebook. I bought it and sold it - AXP and JPM and homeruns now b/c they're so undervalued. Despite the $18bn of debt, banks can't afford to write off loans so they'll refinance with lower rate - extend term - and relax covenants - I think the stock stays in a trading range at best."
"Some how a lot of recent posts and replies have vanished from this board, anyone else notice the same ? It seems Gabriela pulled all her posts that were there this morning ."
For travel related companies with huge debt loads like AVIS its all speculation trading on how long they can stay solvent. I am long the companies with much lower manageable debt and short companies like CAR that will possibly go bankrupt.
"Totally agree, the media overhyped rental prices like they do with everything else. It was a blip during spring break. Can get rental cars anywhere in the US for $40 a day or less right now. Uber and Lyft are still taking market share, and business travel is dead, might not ever return. Avis overseas business is in even worse shape. Easy short from here, especially after earnings release though."
"Total short position less than 7%. A couple of friends visited, one rental car, other gig driver. Rental was only $26.00 / a day. Inflation, per Powell today, still in play...I think in the U.S. Less are going to actuallyfly and rent drive, they'll drive to destination and keep vacay within range. We still have 8.7Million peopleunemployed. The extended unemployment ends in September. People are more concerned about savingwhat they have rather than spending frivolously. I think car hits mid 50's by June, totally overvalued to book and will need to raise cash for debt, looks like car is somehow providing a step up and will take advantage of by a new offering at a lower price to current valuations to stay ""safe"". Hurts the longs. I was lucky enough to short some today at the high of 80.80. Incredible run for longs and do not understand the greed, but hey, so be it. Downgrade to 70.00 from 80.00 and it runs up???? Longs....get the pic"
"Closed out my position today got in at 12, too risky to hold at this point strong pull back up ahead."
"The right time to short $CAR?Finally, the trendline has been violated after an Evening Star Pattern formed on the daily chart.We can clearly see that this stock has been on a strong uptrend since the pandemic, and has almost doubled from the pre-pandemic high ($52.90). Meanwhile, AVIS BUDGET GROUP INC has not been fully operational, sold a big chunk of its fleet and increased its debt significantly. Few things to consider the short position:- Fundamentally overvalued- Bearish pattern formed on the daily chart- Trendline violated- MACD / Price divergence- +DI crossing -DI on 20/04/21- Volume has been drying-up for the past 1/2 weeks. (Be careful with illiquid stocks! They can go any direction for no reason on low volume)- DMI showing trend weakening - Current ratio is 0.87 ...My position is this:Short @ $78.17SL @ $80.50TP @ $64.49Insane risk to reward ratio :ODo your own DD!"
Revenues up 1% since 2019...yet stock is up 200%.....
What do you think of the estimated EPS on May 3? A -0.13/shr but stock price continues to go up. Is it a good time to go short?
"HTZZ resumed trading on the OTC, next will be a relisting on the NYSE, then CAR will not be the only rental car company trading on a major exchange. Watch the spread close between HTZ and CAR. Buy HTZZ, sell CAR. jmho glta"
"As of Feb 2021, NOMURA HOLDINGS INC held 5,147,059 or 7.4% of all Avis stockThe could be ready to sell some of those for profit to deal with their current issues"
I lost my underwear on this #$%$ Down 12k.
I thought the same UncleRemus but looks like I am on the wrong side of the trade this time. My short average is $52 and I think I will cover some this week. Maybe short more if it goes high $60's to bring my average up.I'm shocked at the action and the number of @nalysts that have raised their price targets on this thing. B of A had one raise today to $70 for the love of godCraziness in my opinion...but looks like mine is wrong right now
"Took out another 350M on the 'credit card' and got smashed on their SPV rating by Moody's... folks, I'm not a 'professional day trader' like @j L... but, keep an eye out for the Manheim second half of July report... could drop this to sub $20 quickly. If used cars aren't maintaining value, it will be bad (last pillar for CAR)."
"For now, increased fines for noncompliant flyers, next vax required. What's that going to do to business travel?"
CAR is almost down 30% from it's high. It was an over-inflated bubble that would either burst or deflate slowly. IMHO it will drop further especially if the delta variant spreads.
Open by 4plus dollars for no other reason than the market makers know.
does anyone know why this stock has drop over $12 per share in last 2 weeks? Is it the options or other reason? I do not know see any news - good or bad about this stock. Please educate me
"The problem is not the chart, it is the mountain of debt $18,500,000,000 to be exact. Nearly as much as HTZ. Eventually fundamentals matter, when it matters nobody here knows."
"With gas shortages, gas prices through the roof & a stock market collapse looming.... people aren't going to be out there renting cars."
"Really low volume today , means it does not take much to move price one way or the other ."
can i short this stock long term like say if i think this stock will worth less than 30$ with in 3 years?
"This afternoon (Aug 30) between 1 PM and 2 PM, the maximum price was 88.67 on a volume of 900 at one moment. The very next minute, the maximum went up to 92.27 on a volume of 244,243(Nice number). There was no news about any economic bounty snatched. Manipulation? This is scary for average investor."
CFO steps down to 'pursue other interests'... SRS insider takes over. Hum... after not discussing the 350M in senior debt on the Q call... How do you interpret this?
I am back shorting this again. going in slowly this time. still believe the price will go up the next few days. with this stock gravity will win again
BREAKING NEWS: $CAR AVIS JUST REPORTED EARNINGS BETTER THAN EXPECTED. NOT BAD EARNINGS FOR CAR. THIS IS MAJOR NEWS FOR RENTAL BUSINESS. AWESOME NEWS
"Luckily earnings is in a couple of weeks, that will bring a dose of reality to the share price. I am hoping they announce a share offering in the mean time as well. I am holding strong on my short position and puts."
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7605a/squeeze_avis_car/
lots of profit taking. Probably a good time to do so today. Buy back in next week.
"Stock went up due to iliquidity and short sellers covering some positions. The volume is drying up, good sign of weakening trend. 30/03 Close outside the BB, MFI decreasing along with II%.Great point to short. Who is already short, keep your position, will pay off."
now that Hertz is coming out the gate with full funding and no owed money on the book. plus 7 billion in cars. I wonder what will happen to this house of cards.
Noted two recent insider selling as per SEC filing
"Wishing the all longs a happy weekend. Just priced a 28 day rental at MDE airport $561.00 Usd. Thinking about it 490.00 for round trip tickets. I would need a negative covid-19 test 48 hours or less 150.00 dollars to fly and enter the country both ways in and out. granted Avis is 65/35 USA/international. they may get back to pandemic level by 2022. but certainly not better then before. it will take almost a decade to recoup mountain of losses and pay down NEW debt. Or a stock offering. At the current price. the solution to this delusion is? AMC-GMS 101 issue fresh stock to pay for losing all that money. which I do not fault them for. I use to be long myself 12-55 dollars. They are a Three legged horse at the Preakness. less cars equal less rental days and higher unit utilization. and to grow back have you priced the new cars recently. they really lucked out on used car prices as they trimmed their sail's. labor prices up car prices up insurance up, fuel cost up, and Lease payment up. I just can not see how they are better off today then prior Covid-19 the stock price says they grown 100% in gross and 200% in profit. talk about paying Tesla S price for a golf cart."
"All, just looked at the 1yr comparison... CAR is down less than 1% (at today's close)... after over 1B in additional debt, defleeting 26% (yes, the company is literally only 74% as big as one year ago)... and opening spreads on their bonds... I'm not telling people how to invest, but this just humorous at this point. This thing is one foot in the grave and trading as though TSA numbers weren't at <30% of their normal... GL everyone, but I'm going to be chicken little and remind everyone that the sky truly 'should be' falling..."
"Hey Mary, you must like to 'hear' yourself post on this board. You never have anything productive to say, but maybe if you say it enough you can believe it? I understand your feelings about CAR, but you obviously do not understand the used & new car markets or the rental car industry. There is a lot of big money out there looking for a place to park and the longs in this stock are fortunate management has had the foresight to latch onto innovative partnerships. I am guessing the revenue per vehicle (rpv) in the next earnings report will be up 75% from 2 years ago (obviously no reasonable comparison can be made to last year). Study up and try to learn a little about how the finance arm of a rental company really works. Enjoy the ride while you can:)"
"Traded CAR many many times buying around 20, and unloading in 30's. Like everyone, wish I had a crystal ball because at this price, one would think it easily doubles, possible 4x to the upper 30's by years end. All depends on the airlines bouncing back after the virus is contained/solved. Hopefully people still have cash to travel when it is solved."
"I'm wondering what happened to Scott... also wondering what the general thought is on earnings? We know they'll be 'bad'... but will they be below expectations? Also, wasn't there supposed to be some news about the extended debt covenant? I am not usually inclined to speculate... but the absence of reassurance leads me to believe something is brewing in the board meetings at CAR."
okay I went back in very lightly in a short position at 86. I will double down every dollar up. and and cover in the upper 70s. I truly believe we will see this at 55 by Xmas
"Car seems to be finding hard resistance at $95, so far unable to break new high but yet so close ."
"""Limited international tourism, combined with the reality that no major conventions or festivals are taking place and limited business travel, means that Canadian hotels will face another eight months like the last sixteen."" This a quote by a spokeperson of Canadian Hotel Association(Source Yahoo finance). So what is going to happen to car rentals in Canada. Is that not the case in many countries of the world?"
Getting juicy again! In for puts.
nice pop this morning!
"HTZ have $1 Billion Dollar cash on hand. Carl Icahn wants buy the whole company at cheap price. Couple scenarios to expect: Carl Icahn buy the company at cheap price. Carl Icahn is pushing the company to fire employees in order to force government bailout Also, according to NY Post, Avis $CAR wants to buy HTZ at cheap. This downtrend is intentionally to get takeover at cheap price. Good news for shareholders: NOTHING TO WORRY. ACCUMULATE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AT THESE LEVEL."
"This is the smallest volume I that I recall having seen at this point in the day - at our current rate, the volume will close out the day at 30% of the average on each of the last 10 days of trading."
"Not a lot to be excited about, still losing money and no guidance."
TSA screenings at the airport have dropped dramatically. Less people flying = less people renting cars. This stock is going to drop 20%
"Hertz to the moon, huge potential and future growth"
Again who is buying this company at these prices?I'm looking for a close around $71 or lower today!I still have this feeling later this year or maybe early next that the stock market is in for a major correction again. When the fundamentals matter again and all these company with over inflated PE ratios are caught out. S&P will likely hit 4300 this year and then we will see a 25% correction to get back to something more reasonable based on what the market used to care about and that is profits!
"Upside momentum almost like a 90 degree angle :O what the pastaBid-Ask spread most of the times $0.50-$1 Short squeeze? Hard to believe with this low volume.Market manipulation? Most likely. Why not to attract more bullish retail investors and then crash the stock and take all their money?! Closing price way outside the Bollinger Bands. It seems it has a strong support at the 20 SMA. When is that violated, I will open another short position. Keep an eye on this, is about to go doooooooown <3"
"Hey Razor , hope you got back short or bought you some more puts late yesterday so you can be savoring todays drop. We still got a long way to go."
"This is one of the most manipulated and hyped stocks to trade. The DJ transportatioj index is down and this one goes up as if it is the jewel in the crown; one of the most debt-ridden, yet overvalues stocks."
"A week ago almost to the hour this was at $72.40.....that's up 21% in a week...that isn't right.I do believe longs buying at this price will be in for some pain at some point, I just don't know when that is.I will be covering my short this week and maybe today with my tail between my legs. But shorts, this is good for you as I'm sure the moment mine covers we will see a 5-10% drop in 2 days"
"Alert: SellAvis BudgetThis year has been a wild ride for Avis Budget investors. Shares of the auto rentals giant began the year trading just above $32, reversing all the way down to the mid-single digits by mid-March, only to surge 364% from its low to find itself nearly back to where it was when the year began. This is the equivalent of renting a car, trashing it, and then returning it back to the Avis lot. This is not a good time to be buying any car rental specialist. Its largest rival, Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), declared bankruptcy, and while speculators chasing that stock are doing so without understanding the Chapter 11 process, the same can be said about new Avis Budget investors. Folks buying Avis Budget because they think it will benefit from the Hertz filing may want to think that through. Current Hertz shareholders are likely to get wiped out, but creditors will probably drive away with a reorganized company with a healthier balance sheet. Avis Budget itself is also in a world of hurt regardless how the situation plays out for its cash-strapped rival. It reports quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon and discusses its numbers in an earnings call on Wednesday morning. Things won't be pretty, as analysts see a huge loss on a 69% year-over-year plunge in revenue. The leisure and corporate travel markets are in a funk, and either segment will take several years to truly recover to where we were last year. Why is this stock practically back to where it was before the COVID-19 headlines rocked the world?"
"""Best quarter in our company's history"" PARSIPPANY, N.J., Aug. 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avis Budget Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAR) today announced second quarter 2021 financial results.We ended the second quarter with revenues up more than three times prior year and 1% above second quarter 2019, at $2.4 billion. Our revenues were driven by increased revenue per day compared to second quarter 2020, which represented the depths of the pandemic. Rental days also increased compared to prior year as demand continues to normalize.Net income was $398 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $624 million, increasing more than three times second quarter 2019, making it our best quarterly Adjusted EBITDA in our Company's 75 year history. Additionally, our utilization in the quarter was 71.3% and showed continuous improvement as the quarter progressed ensuring our fleet was well positioned to meet increased levels of demand.Our liquidity position at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.8 billion with an additional $3.4 billion of fleet funding capacity. We have well-laddered corporate debt and renewed our credit facility in July. We now have no meaningful maturities until 2024.“This is the best quarter result in our Company's history and a validation of all the hard work our team has put in since the pandemic began.” said Joe Ferraro, Avis Budget Group Chief Executive Officer. “The momentum we saw in the second quarter is expected to continue through the summer and our team will be ready to take advantage of increased demand while maintaining rigorous cost discipline.”"
"Going forward, CAR will continue to subject to uncontrolled factors due to the pandemic. There isnt a lot of positive comments from the conference call. As you read, ""uncertainty"" is the key word. http://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/static-files/500b9b49-c621-4187-9898-f962a8e983a6Will you long or short this stock? I expect it to drop back to $20 in the short term."
We we going to start the precipitous fall into the weekend?!?
"The robinhood crowd seems to have been selling CAR for the last month. If that holds true for retail investors overall, I wonder who is propping up this share price? SRS?https://robintrack.net/symbol/CAR"
"Do the people buying at this price even look at the long term chart, or just chase momentum? 5 year highs for a company that is downsizing and taking on more debt?"
Good averaging down day. Doubled my put position.
"Read an article yesterday presenting the idea that ~50% of US households have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 economic downturn, that along with a labor market that clearly won't heal for years (not months)... and folks are going to use their discretionary spending to travel before there is a vaccine/herd immunity? Manheim report showed the slow, and potential reverse of resale values back down to pre-stimulus levels and while Labor Day (weekend) travel was up the average is still well below 35% of normal (not even accounting for growth, just YoY). I'm curious why SRS continues to buy, I suppose I may be missing something... any ideas?"
Institutional investors jumping to Hertz at it’s baby stage
I heard about CAR the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Any news out to drive the 25% increase. Other travel stocks not up anywhere near these numbers
"TSA checkpoint at airports still at 1/3 of last year’s number. With 60% revenue from airport locations, 1/3 of airport traffic just doesn’t work. Idle cars mean losses just based on depreciation alone. Only thing the company can do is kept on defleeting, which essentially means selling cars at a loss since those cars didn’t generate any rental revenue.Vaccine will likely be ready by beginning of next year; but getting everyone vaccinated will take some time. Air port traffic will likely remain low until then."
"Hertz CFO Jackson also resigned on August 14 to pursue new opportunities, one day after Avis CFO is replaced by Choi to on August 13. Worth noting Jackson also gave up his retention bonus by leaving. I first thought Choi replacement was initiated by SRS, now it seems it’s the broader industry that is trouble. Normally CFO stays on about 6 years, only 25% leave before 2 years, Avis’ old CFO only been on the job for 18 months. The leaving of both CFO smells like trouble for the industry for an extended period of time. Their compensations are tied together with company performance, with both leaving, looks like both of them they don’t think company will turn around like market expects."
"I am looking at DAL and the other major airlines as the bellwether... their CEO commented on the YoY decrease of 90%+ in traffic and forecasts sustained pressure through at least the end of October. Outside of the Treasury buying CAR bonds when they get down graded to junk... things continue to look less optimistic. Is there any bullish case? Maybe a Vaccine in 6+ months, but does a severely indebted and crippled CAR have a better position than a reborn Hertz at that point? BK seems more and more likely."
Does this CAR stock break any hedge fund? Just wondering.
"$CAR is up 5+% to $81.88. $HTZZ is only still less than $30!!!! Barron's article made MANY mistakes BECAUSE 1).HTZGQ SEC filing had no such data. 2). $13.8 can not possibly be the strike price of warrants. 3)new share counting was wrong too, pretty much baseless. But what can you? It has 'partial facts'. That's all! HTZZ doesn't have to report anything until it is ready to join big board."
"During the call in the a.m. they will try and smooth over, there is a reason pricing was reduced to $70.00 a share. A wolf in sheep clothing. Long beware either way, when the supply chain of chips for automakers improves, CAR will have to incur higher cost on the replacement of what they sold at some point. An earnings beat, doesn't = good. They were drastically reduced"
Q2 vs Q2 stand alone expense is up over 500M? Smaller fleet so i expected the depreciation number to be lower which it is but where did all this cost come from? Looks like all those cost savings they had last year are creeping back in as expected. This is the best it will get. Car rental is notoriously difficult to make money. Now that Hertz is getting back in race expect price wars and standard market share stealing from competitors.
HTZ reportedly looking to reduce its fleet by another 33%. CAR reportedly looking to reduce fleet size too. Looks like revenue/earnings are still being driven by fleet sales vs rented cars.
"One insider sold 8,300 shares of the firm's stock in a transaction dated Friday, March 5th. The stock was sold at an average price of $62.49. The sale was disclosed in a document filed with the SEC, which can be accessed through the SEC website. The selling began? The insider knows better."
"Here are a couple of thoughts for the expected earnings next week. With GM and Ford (and others) unable to get computer chips for new vehicle production, rental car companies are not receiving expected fleet shipments. The wholesale end of used cars, especially trucks are up $5K to $8K per unit over this time last year making current inventory much more valuable, even with higher mileage. Per unit revenue should be up substantially and since CAR also cut operating expenses, I am hopeful we may have a nice positive surprise on the 16th. BTW, was it just a short squeeze that drove the price to $49.60 last week and then quickly drop on the same trading day?"
"with this Bankruptcy , HTZ was able to get rid of all old assets and losses.. this is going to fly like Avis ( $CAR ) soon.."
