16.50 would be a big problem for short...you better mow some lawns over the weekend and start your garage sale for that margin call Mon
I find it mind boggling that this company has a market cap if $2.9B. Wow! Should be about $800M. Buyer beware.
"ANYBODY, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS MGMT. TEAM? too much selling for their silence"
Nice mention in Barrons.
I wouldnt expect this to change much do to the offering really... this doesn't change the high likelyhood of launching their products in US/Japan by the end of 2018
Like I said...I’m a bit cynical...seem this too many times
"another day +$.35 in down mkt. analyst tp $17.50 my feeling higher as JC is draining the companies $$cash so m&a deal soon, buying more including yesterday"
"JC coming ""OUT"" from under his ""ROCK"" to attend 3 conference ,no surprises he's terrible ,just explaining the expenses !!!!! getting ready for a secondary, yes I've bot quite a few shares as this mess has to do M&A deal"
someone just bought 200K shares ...
Nice recovery yesterday. But remains huge disappointment. Have held this stock for 5 years...
"Going to bring the new Board Member to the focus. Personally, what is the value to the comapny. As an investor we have no say, we really don't.

A real M&A expert, or gov't FDA expert of getting FDA approvals to help the company get past this and to get the nanoFlu and RSV through the processes."
Hope the surge continues. It’s been a long time since we saw a $1.82 advance. I’ve owned this for a real long time and have ridden the rollercoaster for years. It’s my largest position in share numbers so every move up or down is greatly magnified in $ terms.
Maybe a good deal but not a good investment ...
"Perceptive Advisors increased their stake in FOLD by 500,000 shares at $12 on 9/12.Got to follow the money$"
"John F Crowley, Amicus Therapeutics's Chairman & CEO and a director of the company, recently cashed-in 22,000 options. The options were exercised at $6.45, while the disposals took place at $10.77 per share, on March 15, 2021. Crowley continues to hold 901,601 shares of the company. Crowley operates out of Philadelphia, PA."
So far holding up better than I would have expected
"If this gets below 10 (though it shouldn’t but who knows how hard panic goes), im folding"
We found a bottom. Yea!!
"9100 shs traded pre MKT. 11/2 hours before the stock mkt. opens ,, 1st time that heavy trading $11 coming soon"

"just maybe, just maybe a offer for this disaster is coming,,a director or two are worried about their ""Fiduciary"" obligation and a director is buying a ton of stock,JC has to go !!!!could break $20 quickly for lots of reasons $$$cash getting burned, and GOLMAN doesn't invite to conferences unless company has something or a possible deal brewing"
"I Have a Few Questions About FoldAs a new investor in FOLD today, maybe some of you long time followers of this company can answer a few questions about the company for me. I bought in @ $14.70 after hours.1. Are these phase III trial results good enough to get a FDA approval for AT-GAA?2. If approved will Amicus sell it for around the same $300,000 per year price as Lumizyme?3. Does AT-GAA have any advantages over Lumizyme?4. In the overall scheme of things, how important to Amicus is FDA approval of AT-GAA?5. Is the almost $6 drop after hours from where it was trading a few days ago justified?"
Looks like Perceptive Advisors had some inside info.
No one is selling to me in the pre-market...come on...I am buying
Just keep buying. It'll be back to 17 by year's end.
"FOLD's massive $2.5 Bil market cap..... Zero profitability estimated by analysts between 2019-2022, based on current NASDAQ data and extremely low insider ownership leads me to believe that FOLD is currently a STRONG SELL.... MTNB"
"Sold my entire shares during premarket to avoid past experience following fda approval.TXMD, ARRY, DOVA.I will let the dust settled before buying back my shares."
why is this up so much today?
"How many shareholders smell a ""Secondary"", JC lives to spend $$$$ money,$stock back to $7 or m&a needed quickly"
"August getting closer, FDA getting closer, shorts getting closer, nearly a million shares already traded today"
"sitting on $500 million in cash and can't get the stock back to the secondary, GET THIS MGMT. TEAM OUT AT PROXY TIME"
"FDA filing accepted.Lots of good stuff happening here so unless you think the market is gonna continue descending, you should be a buyer of FOLD."
"dont listen to predictions, look at the options flow, here on yahoo finance you'll see for yourself where the stock is going. just click on options"
A lot of nervous traders here. Are you in there Baseball guy? You are awfully quiet considering you have not posted under your normal user name. There will be a bunch of short sellers biting their nails here today taking a razor thin risk/reward ratio.
Perceptive Advisors knows something I can guarantee that! They continue to load up despite all the selling going on. We going to see a big boost sooner rather than later I think. Patients young grasshoppers.

I have to hand it to a guy who raises $100MM to help his children combat a terrible disease and co-founded a company that is bought out by Genzyme. Some people just dont see it that way.
"insider buying again, one director a constant buyer, very good news"
"WHEN PROXIES ARE OUT, WE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MGMT. OUT, OUT"
I still own plenty but JC is tricky. for faster Bio. play MRNA will announce test results in less than a month
Stochastic looks like it is coming out of an oversold position if your long term horizon is a month or two.
"This will work its way up again right ? i mean.. great company, great products, great numbers..Undervalued much now ? Thinking of buying in - what do u guys say ?"
"It will hold 12.60, IMO"
"Yea, the pricing on the $21 Calls and Puts is pretty interesting. Good things ahead..."
Well Monday arrived.. not only that Fold didn’t advance on FDA approval but We backtracked by $1.04.Reinforces my view that individual investors are just pawns in this casino called “the market”. We can make money not based on true analysis but rather being on the right side of the movement of manipulators. A stock can advance on news of a lower than expected loss or lose ground with profit and revenue gains that meet but don’t exceed street estimates.
this will stay between 13 and 16 until approvals come in later this year.
$20 soon
"Time for the SHORTS to run for cover,FDA decision on the horizon,"
"JC doing a great job,another yearly low, as he keeps exercising options and then sells 20,000 shares a month"
"If it is better than the standard of care for every criterion, then this is a slam dunk for FDA approval!"
"As long as revenue is growing, FOLD will shine and prices will go higher. Don't worry about cash position or negative income at this point. A big guy may grab the company in near future."
"Bounce back next week to $14 minimum. Very oversold, this one is easy money if you got in today. If not, look for entry next week before the big bounce!"
Amicus Therapeutics CFO Daphne Quimi exercised her derivative options of to buy $FOLD stock with an SEC filing on 3/5/2021.
"SVB Leerink says the drug failed and is no better than standard treatment. Still, I'm guessing the market is overreacting and to sell now (very tempting) is the wrong move. Unlikely we'll see $25 again for a very long time, if at all, but I do expect this will overshoot the low and (hopefully) there is a ""dead cat bounce"". I just bought some at $12.50. Might be throwing good money after bad...but I've seen this movie before."
"With 1,431,234 shs. traded at 3.19pm today , shareholders watch the shorts try to get the volume over 3,000,000 before the close, eps and guidance tomorrow they might just a surprise I may buy a few"
i think this was a good offer price and i think this can be sold for 48$ per share in 2019
"I posted what I am about to repost below 13 days ago, right after Christmas, under Picocluster's post below (19 days ago) so it was buried. I don't post here much but feel it's worth posting again. Will be interesting to see 12/31 short interest. As I pointed out in post after Christmas the only surprise on dips are if you are surprised by it. Usually fold strings several days together so I was encouraged by strength today. As for Matthew and Humour based on their attempted analysis I don't believe they understand the sector and probably shouldn't be in it...although one of them noted NBIX, which I have loved$$ riding so maybe they have hope yet....Here's the repost: Short interest climbed 500k as of 12/15 to 31.36M, which is unfortunate for shorts with the nice grind higher - but for 4 cents, 7 consecutive up days. Well below 37.7M back on 6/15 but still a lot of shares needing cover. Fairly light volume but not immaterial, likely some getting winners on their books as they ditch losers for tax purposes and others positioning for what they expect to be positive catalyst events in '18. May have some consolidation again a time or two, but longs believe we know where the story goes and I can't wait. 2017 was a GREAT year and I can't wait for 2018! In the charitable spirit of the season, I hope most individual shorts have or soon cover - not because I think a little comment here can move the stock, but I don't delight in their pain and I feel there is much coming. Congrats to the longs who believed at this very time last year, and a Happy New Year to all..."
"Will JC SELL another 20,000shares this week with investor day over???"
it will continue to rise with this good long term news
"JC must be working on next dilution ""SECONDARY"""
ANOTHER LARGE SELLER BEFORE NOON
This is the place to be buy in and walk away
Hitting 52 week high everyday! What’s the catalyst??
"THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL, PERHAPS I WAS TOO CRITICAL IN THE PAST"
"FOLD will get its FDA approval on Aug20. Hope can be earlier. Do not know what FDA is waiting for: “Outside the EU, migalastat is approved in Switzerland, Israel, Australia, South Korea, and Canada, with regulatory submissions under review in the U.S., Japan, and Taiwan.”"
Breathed a sigh of relief but very upset over the inexplicably small rise after hours. Halted trading for 3 hours the we get .65 rise. ( actually fell a little early) . You know we would have seen a $5-$10 drop if there was a delay or rejection. It’s my largest position and I’ve ridden this rollercoaster for long time from $5 to $16 and back again.I doubt Monday’s cCall will change things much but we’ll see and I hope for some serious movement.. though I doubt it.
"stock headed under 2nd offering $10.50, just like 1st offering at $15.75, how long before Crowley does 3rd offering at $5"
"Looks like FOLD is bottoming to me. It shouldn't be long before FOLD submits AT-GAA for approval. While people were disappointed with the results, AT-GAA faired well compared to SOC alglucosidase alfa. In fact, patients who switched to AT-GAA did just as well or better. What impresses me most is the biomarkers.AT-GAA patients had much better results in the Hex-4 and the CK than did patients on alglucosidase alfa. I can't see why anyone would want to short this now and in fact I would expect shorts to begin covering. That may explain why this seems to have found a bottom and has been rising lately. As for me, I'm buying."
"FOLD directors will be looking for merger partner, as they could never do a secondary again and l/c is fully borrowed out, sad what JC has done to this company with high hopes"
"again ,this little miss managed company trades 3.2 million shares on the downside, while expenses are evaporating the remaining cash, only being saved by 2 dilutive secondary offerings, the company has to be sold or a management change quickly"

"9.40am our CEO speaks at a conference, can't imagine what worse he can say or do, as price of shares tells all"
I have seen FOLD upside articles on Barons WSJ etc. I think this stock has an upside to 15 after the new year
Heads up. They're getting ready to run this back over $16 by Friday. Mark it.
"100 ++million share trading days, could just mean ""SHORTS"" getting squeezable"
"As Yogi Berra said, it is deja vu all over again. FOLD's Migalistat went through the same situation before getting approval. The clinical trial for Migalistat had several cohorts, divided by disease severity/progression and the results for all but one cohort were indisputable and statistically significant, but for the patients with moderate/less-severe disease, the results were not - not because the drug didn't work, but because trying to tease out a difference in kidney function (eGFR measurements) for those with moderate disease didn't work - those with severe disease showed definitive improvement in the measurement, as well as all the other biological endpoints. Close to 100% of the patients that went through the Migalistat trial and switched from the ERT treatme chose to stay on Migalistat in the extension phase of the trial. Sound familiar? Just like the current situation, the ""market"" couldn't get past a missed p-value and the stock went from $15 to $5, before Migalistat was approved. It was a buying opportunity then and it is a buying opportunity now!"
Repost: I see my comment got deleted for some reason or another so again I believe this is a harsh pullback and reaction I think its a bit over done here. I realized the results fell short of expectations but its not like the company is over. I have been down this road many times and the pain of seeing the stock tumble so unexpectedly hurts however it wont last forever they will continue to work on it. I been through this road with with $KIDS $CODX $INO and $NVAX all had me holding on in deep red during down times at some point but they all turned around and are doing very well so I can see this happening here. With that said I decided to pick up some shares on discount and will hold long term since I found out this company has collaboration and license agreements with Nationwide Children's Hospital and I like holding on to things that can help Children in need of therapy and treatments. I get it stocks are stocks but I feel some are special and worth supporting especially ones that can help people.... Lets go FOLD some things take time to work on so lets use it and get better to improve and help others.
"18 Study results are out and once again show improvement for almost all patients. Also tolerance and safety look great. Seems to me the FDA has no reason to not accelerate the approval but remember, this is government we are talking about."
What’s happened?
"@dcaf I read that their treatment addressed ""late onset disease"".Went to Fold website info on their product addressing disease 2 ways.1. AT-GAA Phase 32. Pompe Gene Therapy w/ Penn. Is that Penn University? My question is FOLD trying to address/prevent the disease in it's infancy via Genes.Thanks to all for any clarity.Stay safe."
"Amicus assumed with an Overweight at Cantor Fitzgerald Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Eliana Merle assumed coverage of Amicus Therapeutics with an Overweight rating and price target of $20, up from $19. The analyst sees ""long-term underappreciated potential"" and views 2020 as a key year for execution.

"Annoucing yet another offering I fully expected a dip of at least $1 or more today, as you might have read. No significant price drop then turns later into. .55 gain ( or more later) certainly pleases me.... and more importantly validates the idea that people smarter than us expect more good news. Positive approval in the US and Japan would push this stock up $7 to $10 ps easily and make it a acquisition target. ( I can dream can’t I !!!)"
"every month Crowley is granted shares 20,000 shares at $3.82 then turns around same day and sells in the open mkt. always $11 or greater, when is enough/enough fellow shareholders?????"
Is this a good buy at this price?
Wow! Who knew? Lol
How sweet it is!So much for the numby who said it's worth 11!
The entire biotech sector is getting clobbered. Many stocks are down 50% or more. I added some shares at $12 thinking I would make a quick profit. Now hoping just to get back to $12 again.
"I think, it is good news for FOLD, ""it failed to demonstrate superiority"".Sanofi enzyme replacement therapy shows mixed results in Pompe studyJun. 16, 2020 8:24 AM ET|About: Sanofi (SNY)|By: Douglas W. House, SA News Editor Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) announces positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, COMET, evaluating avalglucosidase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy, in patients with late-onset Pompe disease, an inherited disorder characterized by the buildup of glycogen in the body's cells due to the dysfunction of a certain enzyme.The study met the primary endpoint demonstrating non-inferiority (no worse than) to alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme) as measured by the change in respiratory function but it failed to demonstrate superiority, the other primary objective.Since superiority was not shown, statistical testing of the secondary endpoints was not done."
Good buy moment now?
It is why SP dropped today.https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-06-08-07-00-00
"Why bring on a new board of directors...seriously is he going to move this stock? If so, tell me what your plans are? This company would be twice the valuation as it is today if managed more strategically. Why can't we shareholders approve of these decisions. How can I be nominated for the board? Is this new director going to improve my valuation in anyway or continue to keep us stagnant? Don't mean to be disrespectful either but what does having served in the military have to do with serving on a board of a biopharm company? What are his plans to improve our valuation? Why make a public announcement of an new board member if there are no strategic plans to improve shareholder valuation."
"Question:If the FDA approves this then FOLD's stock will hopefully begin rising again correct? And how much could it reach? Like $20 which would be back to normal, or would it go even higher? And does anyone know when the FDA will decide?"
"Per CEO statement from Sanofi and Novartis, it will take minimum 18 months to come up with Corona vaccine. Huge sell off in the market is nothing but temporarily get rid of risky assets by big asset managers. This Coronavirus may has little impact on 1st and 2nd qtr earnings but fundamentals of overall long term global growth outlook has not shifted. Fold completed and exceeded patient enrollment in the global phase III PROPEL study for Pompe disease. Fold plans to apply for and initiate a rolling submission of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for AT-GAA in late-onset Pompe disease and complete the final submission in the first half of 2021. Further, the company has two gene-therapy programs in the pipeline for two different types of Batten disease. Fold has exclusive worldwide rights to Penn’s next-generation gene therapy technologies for a majority of lysosomal disorders and 12 additional rare diseases, including Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy and selected other muscular dystrophies. Fold has partnerships with Catalent Biologics and Thermo Fisher for clinical and commercial gene-therapy manufacturing. Brammer Bio, a part of Thermo Fisher, will assist Amicus’ gene therapy programs in CLN6 and additional forms of Batten disease with clinical and commercial-scale capabilities. Having all this positive news this stock is too cheap. Strong buy and hold in every dip in the market."
"more good days ahead,Goldman conference a few days away ,stock breaks $10 this week"
Look at this cup and handle formation it is well established. I want to shutter because they are so confident about this drug approval but the charts say that $18 is in shooting distance. I’m back in.
to the moon!
"just bot enough to stay awake, pretty good volume this time of day"
This news should have been expected and trial results for Pompe will be released this year. Selling a few weeks ago surely was smart (I wish I did) but is not prudent here.
"I've watch this stock for year always owned /shorted, todays volume and the number of upticks was very positive, just maybe!!!! it's ok"
Why is FOLD making a public offering when it has $300 million in cash (supposedly enough to last till mid 2021)?

Still trading at 50x sales. Overvalued at this point maybe by 25%. good entry point around $11.
Shorts hitting this board. Good sign if you're long. Lots of thumbs down for bullish posts. Yup.
"I truly believe that FOLD is past the point where Migalistat revs will never be a huge driver of share price but that said. Pompe trials will cause some volatility but what he markets will be focusing on are any of the gene therapy trials, despite the fact that they are very early phase. GT is the buzzword of biotech."
"December 5, 2019. FOLD dropped about 7% without any reason in the green market. Just 2 days ago was up about 4%. Some people may are taking profit and selling for taxes. However, the company is strong and growing and new products will be be approved and award long investors. Just have patience and some dry powder to take the opportunity."
Is the share price really below 10 or am I dreaming??
even more attractive to Vertex as a buyout target now. Good but not as good as hoped for results paves the way for takeover... Let the option trading frenzy settle and then buy below $13
"anybody watching the tape ,you'll see JC just has to go, for the stock to go up"
"showing signs of news again in early trading, $12.50 soon"
It's acting like there is a lock on it. Shorts beware
"Why is it taking too long for FOLD to apply for the approval of Migalastat/Galafold? Any reasons for the delay, been a year already."
Any chance tomorrow's presentation will move the stock price with new data? Or will it just be a rehash of old news?
"Sell I can smell another shelf registration!,,,the chairman needs a third summer house,"
What's with the $12 resistance?
"Its been a tough week for Fold and even for the rest of the market but I am glad to see some recovery so soon. Despite the AT GAA phase 3 results not being as hoped for, in no way does it mean everything here as a company is a failure. The company still offers effective treatments and therapies for a range of rare diseases. There is always room for improvement with any clinical study and I expect improvements will be made in the future. Amicus Therapeutics has much to offer overall and I will continue to hold my investment I did manage to add on some of the dip but holding long term will be the best bet for this one. Hopefully we see some upward gains in the coming weeks when some exposure from the investor conferences occur as clearly there is large upside potential from these levels."
"4 days of Fold giving details of what JC has been up to, normally he does a terrible job in forward statements. I'm betting by buying he's getting smarter with age ,and has stopped exercising options and selling shares, my feeling is stock hits $25 kinda quickly"
"FOLD rushing to another conference next week probably is a positive to explain whats up as the stock went down 50%, this should be good news and the next 7 days probably will have stock over $15"
"from seekingalpha kesegeo"" I believe that Amicus Therapeutics is a buy."" authorI'm strongly disagree.Today's Amicus M/C is $ 2.7B, which is about 30 expected revenues for this year and almost 16 expected revenue for the next year. In my opinion it is too much.Amicus loses about $50-60 M per quarter and its profitability in the coming years is very doubtful.As for the medicine itself, it does not have any advantages over ERT except oral administration.This is certainly more convenient then Infusion although I know that many patients make Infusion at home. But convenience for patients with this terrible disease (life expectancy of men on average is less than 60 years). is not the main thing.FD patients first need to stabilize kidney function,cardiac parameters,gastrointestinal symptoms,reduce pain.The medicine that can solve these problems is PRX-102 so I invested in Protalix BioTherapeutics ."
Yahoo stats say that this stock is held 119% by institutions. That is hilarious. They are getting bought out soon.

Seems unusual ...good clinical update but weak stock response unless people know they’re going to sell shares to raise capital

"In the 3rd quarter of this year Sanofi is expected to receive FDA approval for their Pompe drug. Amicus are now developing their drug for the same disease, but they seem to have no important events for the same period. Thus we can conclude that sanofi is likely to takeover the Pompe market... Technical situation is bad too. Target=at least 5$"
This was so oversold. From TA looking at year chart it is due for a bounce.
Been getting burned all the way down from 12. Gave up at 9.00. Got a gift this morning at 7.20. Doesn't come close to putting a dent in my losses but at some point the towel gets thrown in...hopefully that was this morning. There is value here but dang if I know if that's 8.50 or 14.50.
You can always count on Crowley to wait till the very last minute to file anything that will benefit shareholders
"WHAT is up with this mgmt. team, the stock is trading in the $12.s, plus they never communicate, and the secondary holders must be ready for some good news remember everybody we have proxy rights"

"FOLD will not recover without the biotech sector recovering. I would have thought news that the Trump administration had shelved its Medicare drug cost-cutting proposal (after pressure from pharma) would lift up the sector. I reckon it is collateral damage from the continuing trade war with China, although one would think that the biotech sector would be immune."
"Is anybody concerned @ how easy the syndicate price of $15.50 was broken, and stays down?"
"Anyone that is familiar with the clinical travails of SRPT in DMD knows that the 6MWT is fraught with complications - primarily being able to establish comparative patient populations. It is almost impossible, especially with small patient populations, to get two patient groups to be balanced at baseline in terms of their current level of disease progression and expected change during the trial period. The 7 patients in the treatment naive group treated with Lumizime performed better than expected on the 6MWT - this does not mean the trial failed or that FOLD's drug is inferior - all the other data confirms the superiority of FOLD's drug - it will be approved and it will be quickly adopted by the market over Lumizime."

"From Goldman Sachs presentation:- In the second half of the year, Amicus is going to announce a licensing and/or partnership in gene therapy/gene editing in field of rare metabolic disorders. - In the second half of the year will have an Analyst R&D Day. Will talk about potential gene therapy programs.- By the end of this month, will be able to provide an update on a feedback from European agency on the approval path (Pompe). In a third quarter will have a type C meeting with FDA. - Pompe. Q: How are you differentiated from a standard of care? A: Compare to what is known, these are strikingly good results. Based on 19 patient study, these patients are no longer getting weaker. Vast majority of them are actually getting stronger. For most of patients, we reversed the course of this disease. That has not been seen to our knowledge in a literature for any therapy ever investigated or marketed in this field.- Galafold potential is a $0.5B in peak sales, Pompe potential is a $1B in peak sales.- More than 40% of peak sales of Galafold will come from the US and Japan."
This Coronavirus is giving me a great opportunity to exit my FOLD position. FOLD hasn't suffered very much so I am going to sell my entire position and use the proceeds to buy an ETF a month down the road and double my money easily -because this Coronavirus is going to get a lot worse. It will be a 2008 financial crisis type of opportunity.
Management continues to enrich themselves at shareholder expense.
FOLD IS JUST ABOUT READY TO LAUNCH!
"pre mkt. 990,000shs. never before , something up ,plus mgmt. team at a conference"
"did anybody check the volume Friday afternoon from 1pm to 4pm, 30x1 on 400,000shs of selling or shorting, again not a sound from mgmt. if this company is for real the Shorts would really suffer"
"I'm speculating that this is sell on the news because the earnings call was very positive. The call painting a very optimistic picture regarding clinical progress, market opportunities and product adoption."
Baseball...Credit where credit is due. Nice call on the buy.
"trades like approval soon,buying more"
"started buying today, by end of week or next week will have a pretty fair sized position, still will vote any proxy action against JC"
"so much for my trade,even with recent buys in the $12's my average is now a little over $13, between the mgmt. team and the shorts a very discouraging stock"
Why is this down?
Looks like I was wrong and it hasn't found a bottom yet. Keeps slowly drifting down. Where is No Way Out. Haven't seen him in a couple of days.
There is some compelling patterns in this short term trace. 1 month and 5 day
"no more secondaries ,maybe POMPEI could drive stock price way up, then be careful of a secondary"
Oh wow! This company still exists! You should talk to it’s employees and you would run away from it
"Here is what was said at Wednesday earning call:1. Expect $0.5B peak sales opportunity for Galafold in Fabry with amenable mutations.2. Expect more than $1B revenue by 2023.3. 50 new patients on Galafold in the first two months of the year (~$10M additional revenue/year).4. Approval in Japan in 1H18.5. 348 amenable mutations are covered now, 266 was at the time of approval. Market expansion.6. Recent revenue guidance does not include potential sales in Japan and US in 2018. Most likely, guidance will be revised to reflect higher sales.7. High rate of compliance (Galafold).8. Parity pricing strategy, means equal price for Galafold and ERT."
"1.5MILLION SHARE FOR SALE ON THE BELL, MGMT. STILL HIDING UNDER A ROCK ,SO ARE THE UNDERWRITERS THAT DID THE SECONDARY AT $15.50"
Fully funded through 2022 and now the expanded use of Galafold into new markets. FOLD only going up.
"SO I am part technical trader and on the daily chart we just hit the golden cross of the 50 and 200 SMA. A close above the 14.82 (the 50 MA on 1 year chart would be great), but strength into the close is a good sign for longs in the short-run. Indicates shorts are giving in.Fundamentally, of course today was good news."
"Ok let me get this straight....Amicus basically just told us today that they exceeded their guidance on the higher end with about 91 million in sales and next year they're going to basically double that, additionally they have all kinds of data coming up for batten disease and pompe, they got 500 million in cash on hand, yet today we only went up .64% on all this fantastic news, what in the $@^#&# is going to act as a catalyst to get this thing going in the right direction???? please someone humor me......just baffled that this thing didn't soar today"
must be some good news coming with all the insider buying
will not recover the way this mgmt. team spends money
"Baseball, what’s your opinion at this time?"
Anyone care to speculate on Today's filing with the SEC?http://ir.amicusrx.com/static-files/53e14c5c-b0ce-4f05-a6af-151319f76349
Crowley runs this company like it’s his baby. Cause it his. Great ER report. He keeps eye on expenses & is cognizant of burn rate. Great cash reserves. Dude rocks!
"I was wrong earlier at 500,000 shares shorted, or sold in last 1/2 hour, as they(Nasdaq) just posted and additional 2,174, 000 million shares sold, people , mutual funds and mgmt.co's. are tired of these guys doing nothing , only dilution , only m&a or activist saves us"
new year low expected today...hope something good comes out...
Myles...Oppenheimer says vstm going to 16 Upgraded today. That would rule!
"I think the Pompe drug will be approved but this should take a while to drive solid revenues. I am excited about this because of Galafold revenue growth, financial strength with over $400M in the bank, and the gene therapy pipeline. The Pompe unknown is actually keeping this stock down. This is definitely a long term hold for me, especially at this low price."
"ANTHONY NOTO should be saying something about huge ""SPAC"" shareholders selling this many shares???????????"
Is there any point in shorting this anymore?
"Only 1/4 million shares on close today for sale, congrats. JC you got paid for another day"
"For those technical people, the 50 day and 200 day MA are getting ready to cross."
"Lumizyme failed vs placebo in the 6MWT. Look it up - it is part of their prescribing packet. 81 patients (55 got Lumizyme and 26 got placebo) were treated over 78 weeks (26 more than the FOLD trial) and they missed statistical significance in the 6MWT (p=0.06), but it was still approved due to the improvement in lung function (FVC - p=0.04). FOLD's drug now shows statistically meaningful improvement vs Lumizyme in FVC (p=0.0243) over 52 weeks and people are bailing on this stock. You have to be clueless to think that the FDA is going to point to a treatment naive cohort of 27 patients that tainted a head-to-head comparison in 6MWT and deem that as the critical part of the trial. Approval is a slam dunk and with the head-to-head comparisons, docs will switch their patients as quickly as possible - what doctor will risk a patient's lung function deteriorating while there is a drug proven to prevent that?"
With any luck BASEBALL sold all his shares yesterday and we will never be showered with his wisdom ever again. I'm still holding out hope for HotCheetos though as I'm a firm believer in some things are just better learned and retained the hard way.
"The nerve of this mgmt. team is beyond belief, a secondary after 2 years ago selling $500 million at $15.50 secondary, then come back for $300 million and the usage is for salaries. The ""Shorts"" know exactly what to do, then at $6 per share or out of business ""short"", mgmt. continues to be worst mgmt.team in biotech, very very good at paying large salaries. I'm long now like you other long shareholders, holding the bag around $13 per share"
"We should wait for analyst updates on the latest results. Even if they missed narrowly on the primary endpoint, I think patients/physicians will switch to this drug and insurance companies will pay. Any improvement in the condition of these patients is desirable, given how painful the condition can be. Besides, I don't think the current standard of care is so cheap as to discourage switching over to this new drug."
I seem to remember Sanofi’s phase 3 results fell short of Fold’s phase 2 results for Pompe disease. I apologize if I am mistaken.
WHO WOULDN'T ACCEPT THE SECONDARY PRICE IN A TENDER OFFER????? $15.50 AND A NEW MGMT. TEAM
I bought more today at 13.30 its the similar situation to abeo . short it down and watch it pop. imo stock will be 15-15.50 in a week . look at the may 17 strike price for options. Its paying a dollar even though the strike price is 3.25 cents away . someone thinks something big is going to happen
"THE COMPANY WAS SMART TO RAISE A TON OF MONEY AT$15.50,WHiLE THEY WAIT TO BE APPROVED AND EXPAND"
"one director seems to know whats going on, now we need JC to move on"
Only been waiting around like 5 years for this.
"still 33 million short shares and JC still around , with declining cash and his lack of knowledge, yes i'm nervous but long"
let's hope it will resume in trading session!
"early upside volume buying more , Friday or Monday trade,hopefully a good one and get LUCKY"
"FOLD can't stay above $10.50 , the price of the secondary where JC sandbagged a lot of us investors, thusly it's a great short, where the large shorters will play this stock, m&a deal is a must unless JC leaves"
"finally after a few years something good is taking place,yes I've SHORTED this stock for years, bot quite a few yesterday will have a large position in a couple weeks. Haven't changed my opinion on how bad a CEO JC is,when the stock breaks above $27, JC will need to say/do something"
"In this type of ARKK stock market the stock is doing OK, main problem and always will be JC is way over his head, the company should GO the M&A route for about $25 ,I continue to buy every day"
"fellow shareholders, this stock is ready for a nice move, I've followed FOLD for years, true I was short, made $$money ,all during the Mistakes of JC, news would be FDA approval or a selling out of the company. JC is a spender and can't control expenses, but for now the stock should trade over $17"
$2.4B market cap on $180M in estimated annual revenue?!? Lol
If FDA approval then $20-$22? Any opinions ?
I was looking to buy a few calls today and noticed how rich the price was. It seems the sellers of those callsare asking $5 for a 25 strike 40 days out. They expecting this thing to pop that much.I'll stay pat with just my shares. HAGW everyone.
"What up, shorties?"
"1.6MILLION SHARES ON THE BELL, GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER"
Bank of American Buy rating $21/PT. Good morning.
"Very nice, 850,000 shares trade at the bell, time is approaching"
"So, it appears there are about 3000 people with this Fabry disease in the US. Conservatively, they capture 33% of the market, about 1000 people. At $300k a treatment, we would be looking at what $300mm in revenue per year? Is that about right?"

Amicus gene therapy. Something new in slide 64?The combination of the engineered gene (enhances protein movement from cell to cell) with the U Penn enhanced viral delivery system proposed for Pompe etc (enhances movement to the target organ with improved genetic transfer) looks potentially revolutionary. Any other company taking a similar approach?ga
Today was the deadline to file the Pompe BLA. Did they do it?
"In 2014, FOLD “only” had 64mn shares outstanding and cumulative losses of $447mn. In the most recent 10q the company’s share count is up to 259mn and cumulative losses are nearing $2 billion! Shareholders have been diluted into oblivion by this management team. But you need not worry because this management team has given themselves more than enough stock options along the way to ensure that they keep milking this company for every cent they can. Get out of this stock while you can"
"looks like a sec filing, any comments anybody??"
"Good or bad stock, majority of the time it the management that has the largest hand in driving the share price. there isn't any good management out there anymore it greed that drive this market just like politics it's all about what in it for me."
Why fold is up? any reason?
FDA decision in 6 months under priority review!!! WOW!!!! How is thing only up 3% pre market?
Tough time...I’m two for two tonight.. secondary offering for FOLD and a secondary offering for Twlio. Twlio has had a great run but it still hurts bad knowing it lets new investors down. Both had plenty of cash to start with too.
"They have over $500M in cash at the end of Q2, so in a word, no."
great time to buy IMO
18.16 is the 52 week high
Approved ! Congrats all Longs !
"as I recall 100% of the study participants decided to stay on the medication because of improved results, so I look forward to see this drug go to market and see the long terms gains realized!"
"Shareholders a big day for us, lets hope the presentation is in the hands of CFO, the ceo is just a spender and $$money is running low. Actually we should be sold"
9 looks like a done deal.
Somebody bought 266000 after market
I want to cry
"@jerryK -- Oh, didn't see your post (GOOD news!!) - feeling even better about my big buy today re FOLD: ""Bank of American Buy rating $21/PT."""
I think Baseball and HotCheetos are waiting for this to hit $16 again before they buy....
"So, is this all a reaction to the CEO committing to no price increases above the CPI? On the other hand, they updated the projected market opportunity and from what I gather they have increased the number of potential patients for Galafold by 50% or so from what they were projecting when they launched the drug. Whatever - Galafold is firmly positioned to take a big chunk of the Fabry market and their Pompe drug is moving through the clinic smoothly, so two years from now this will be a $50+ stock."
Head fake at the opening. Galafold is growing and what is interesting are the other phase 4 studies underway. Pompe and Batten also looking good.
I just bought a position here -- 52-week low with some positive news -- interesting!
Does anyone have a clue what's going on with FOLD?
Nice plug by Jon Najarian on the Halftime Report put additional wind behind the sails
"shareholders, we need new CEO, stock will jump to $17.50"
"Little bit of patience is all that is required folks! Rye now, FOLD is acting like it is a MF -- before you think of profanity, . it stands for Mutual Fund. It needs to be converted into a growth stock; and that will commence anytime soon. The tutes are done having as much as they want; ~100%. Now, this will run.. hold tight... I'm thinking that in 3 years this will exceed $70!!!"
I've been around for a long time and this is one of the strangest reactions I've seen in a LONG time.
ARCA. Plating around on level 2. Trades. 9.90. And then drop lower. 9.30’s. What is going on?
"Once the covering begins, it's gonna reverse and fast."
Longs.....do not let the MMs drive this down and steal your shares at a cheaper price. Have patience.
"Barring a real bad market, I think we an get to 17 tomorrow."
"""Dilution""Therapeutics gets a dead cat bounce."
"I wont make grand predictions that this will go up to the moon here, but there is a very strong sense it still gets approval based on the CEO interview. DYOR and good luck!"
That was a strong close for such a red week we had and already we are seeing some nice chart patterns. Aside from that the actual company itself is still valuable with treatments to rare diseases still offered here with products and services for that. The recent selloff was pretty overblown and I am sure many who left will get back in when we have some new planning and eventual positive results.
GOOOOOOD Morning Amicusians
