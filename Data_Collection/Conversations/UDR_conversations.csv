This has been looking strong lately. Would be nice to see it trade over $50 again. Maybe bump up the dividend too?

"As of 07/21/2021, there's only a delta of about 1.3% between UDR's yield and US10Y. This stock is in a bubble territory. If US10Y were to get back to 2% in the next 12 months, you are looking at UDR at about $45, which is 20% below the present market value. If you buy now, you will get $0.363 x 4 in dividend next 12 months, but watching your investment lose 20% does not seem like a good deal. Sell now. Buy back in the $40's. US10Y will not stay this low."

"On 12/20/2013, UDR cost $23/share while US10Y was nearing 3%. Yield back then was 4.1%.Today 04/19/2018, UDR costs $35.3/share while US10Y is at ~3% as well. The yield on this stock today is 3.5%.UDR will need to fall to near $30/share just to yield as it did back then.With the Fed raising 25 basis points every 90 days, long term Fed Fund rate at 3% which is double of what it is today and US10Y continuing its climb + 1year CD at 2%, this stock UDR, along with the rest AVB, AIV, MAA are going to continue to slide.Who are these soon-to-be bag holders still holding on to this stock at this price today? They already saw the sharp decline in December 2017 and are still holding? That's beyond me.My first limit order purchase is at $30/share, see you there soon!"
