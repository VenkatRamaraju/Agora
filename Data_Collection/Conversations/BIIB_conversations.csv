$BIIB trading LOWER than it was BEFORE FDA approval for its alzheimer drug. It's been bad mouthed so much that earnings expectations were set too low imo. Watch $BIIB blowout earnings. DON’T MISS this opportunity to load afterhours.
What do you make of the dismal sales of Aduhelm? Did they say numbers were moving up? Very discouraging I thought.
"On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $17 billion! On June 24th, $LLY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Their Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $15 billion. Last Friday, Roche announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of its Alzheimer's medication. Its market cap increased by $13 billion. SAVA's Market cap sits at $2 billion. If the market cap increases by the Median ($15 billion), the SP will 8.5x. Oh, did I mention the above changes happened on ONE trading day? It did.

"this stock reports earnings wednesday, given recent information about its pipeline, i think it heads to the $260 area? any thoughts."

"Whether you agree with the drug approval or not, the reality is this is sitting at a valuation like the approval didn't happen at all.Earnings call expect a pop to $330, when the harsh truth is revealed that this drug is making them a lot of money.Protest the approval all you want, don't lose money over it though."
$BIIB looking so STRONG today. Analysts reiterated their BUY opinion. MAINTAINED $BIIB as an OVERWEIGHT. Must have been because BIIB stated they bought 750 million dollars worth of shares in the 3rd quarter at $341 PER SHARE and the board approved for an additional 2.8 billion dollar share buy back! $300 by next Friday
"I have been a shareholder of Biogen for a long time, seen the ups and downs.. I’m not pushing this company on anyone, though I have studied this company for a long time. I believe that Biogen is a strong fundamental company that had many products in neuroscience that are in testing and in works to be approved soon..For example, they have 2 drugs coming out for 1) depression ( which is for millions of people) and 2) PPD ( another fir millions of people). The drug Toferson for ALS, even though wasn’t 100% successful, they still have many positive outcomes from and are continuing to work on it. Though ALS disease is really not a high population ( thankfully). The Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm, will be a success, it works definitely slows down the progression of Alzheimer’s. ( I’ve seen my mother in- law sue from it, it’s a fast moving disease, horrible). Any hospitals or insurance companies not covering it, will eventually cover it..They have many other drugs in the market helping people, along with many in the pipeline.As for the stock, this is very cheap. If I didn’t think they had much products to go on, I would leave the company. Do your research, this is an undervalued stock, that literally should be around 365… when the Depression and PPD drugs come to market, this will be 450..Just my opinion, but what do I know, I’m only a retired old analyst, who worked for an investment company dissecting companies products and financials..Good Luck, God BlessP.S. any feedback, please be intelligent thoughts,"
what's wrong with biogen today?
Tomorrow tells all!
If recipients of Aduhelm claimed it does help them in slowing down memory loss and side effects are minimal then Aduhelm will be a blockbuster. Get to wait one or two more quarters just be patient
"They produced an Alzheimer drug that really doesn't cure anything that costs a patient $45,000.00 a year. Not very difficult to see why this is a failure."
Cantor Fitzgerald has lowered its price target on Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) to $427 from $435 (~50% upside) while maintaining a neutral recommendation.
$BIIB HUGE NEWS! Truist gives a $502 price target today!! Morgan Stanley gave a price target of $440! And a few more analysts. NONE of the professionals buying the doom & gloom smear campaign. It's RUNNING!
"Great Reddit Post: Valuation: On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of ADUHELM (Alzheimer's medication, AD). The market cap went up to $17 Billion.On June 24th, $LLY announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Donanemab (Another AD medication). The market cap increased by $15 billion. If SAVA announces a fast-track process for approval of its Alzheimer's (AD) medication, assuming it increases by 15 billion (like lly), that would be an 8.5x move in ONE DAY!I'll explain why Cassava has an excellent chance at being fast-tracked (soon) but let me highlight two key points first: 1) The above catalysts were NOT FDA approval; They were announcements that FDA approval was fast-tracked. 2) SAVA's AD medication has achieved what BIIB and LLY can only fantasize about. It is far superior to both. I'll provide data for that to make it clear. As the above is related to valuation, I'll throw in that you want to read more about valuation; see the Seeking Alpha article below. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6w8h/sava_cause_more_wrinkle/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source= click on the link to finish reading."
"$BIIB bought a whopping $750 million worth of shares in the 3rd quarter, reducing shares outstanding by 6% & board authorized purchase of up to $2.8 BILLION worth of shares! Keep sleeping  on these gift prices."
I think the $504 price target given by Truist today sounds the closest to where $BIIB is heading. The market is soaking up all the targets given by 7 analysts today. So much for the doom and gloom
"Aduhelm had just $300k in sales for Q3. At $56k a pop, you do the math on how many want to risk trying their drug. Sux for Alzheimer's sufferers that this doesn't work."
The ALS data must've leaked ahead of results being announced. Thus the herd of downgrades.
