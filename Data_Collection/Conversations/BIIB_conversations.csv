SAVA! !! !!!
If I wanted to pay the whole bill is there a clinic I could go to immediately or has the drug not even rolled out yet ?
https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/2021/09/09/data-fda-aduhelm-approval-alzheimers-requested-by-congress/Is this the culprit of the day.
What's BIIB's and LLY's biggest problem going forward ? SAVA's 9 month safety and efficacy data release on July 29th
(ERYP) $4.77 --Potential 2x BLA filings for attractive Cancer Drugs within 6 months and more clinical data readout expected during 2H 2021 =this under radar stock could be a $50+ stock within 12-18 months .https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210702123234-screenshot-2021-07-02-at-12-29-06-microsoft-power.png#################
They had some interesting insights about BIIB on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Biogen will use $6 Billion to buy back shares now. That is around 26-27 million shares ..plus they have bot 4.5 million shares already
Let’s just wait for the EU approval to roll in. The Europeans are not going to be happy to be denied what their American counterparts can access!! That’s 2.5 billion people. Can we atleast agree 1.5 million ultimate users worldwide only 200k in America. That’s already 100billion. What is this market missing!
"Serious question, should Biogen try and buyout SAVA ?. Like buying out Tysabri from ELN back in the day to corner the market. Also hedging their bet with a secondary treatment therapy."
down to $300. karma for rushing a fake drug
this stock should b 200 .. and not get that approval.. buy SAVA AVXL .. period
Any thoughts on share price Monday?
Biib’s anti-Tau will complement its Aduhelm to treat AD. BIIB is a leading company in treating Neurology disease. They will prevail
"Does anyone have thoughts on the Phase 1 trial that Biogen started recently for subcutaneous delivery of Aduhelm? Looking for reasonable, interpretive insight into the company’s plan/strategy. Thanks in advance."
Buy SAVA and thank me later ;)
"I would assume there are atleast 50,000 multi millionaires in there 50s with some version of decline and are like heck I have nothing to lose to so might as well. That’s 5-6 billion right there."
"Shorts, this kind of news has been baked into the price since ages ago, giving an explanation to the fallA review was inevitable, the price being revised downwards till around 36K is also inevitable and has been priced in (hence the 30% or so drop from peak, which represents a huge loss in mcap)Gov can not seriously question FDA that much as it is the FDA's decision, NOT the governments. FDA will also stress the fact that approval was given under it's accelerated pathway scheme which further cements the idea that efficiacy is not required as in depth as with a conventional approval.Main problem here will be the gov looking to revise price downwards due to low efficiacy, this will lead to gov, FDA and biogen dispute about the accelerated pathway not requiring absolute efficiacy proof, and even in worst case scenario, if price is revised down, won't impact sp even that much as a revision is expected."
Barrons reported today that there's a 70% chance of Aducanumab getting FDA approval and if you check the insider's report you'll see 17 insider purchases and no sales in the last six months.
$BIIB out of 33 analysts CURRENT AVERAGE PRICE TARGET still $420! These bears trying to post fear are AMATEURS. Currently trading at the price target of most analysts BEFORE FDA approval. Friday will be green as cabbage. Someone bought $52 MILLION worth of shares on Wednesday at $374! They're gonna run this soon. Adding 750 shares tomorrow.
"If 6,000,000 people have Alzheimer’s disease and only 20 percent use this drug, isn’t the revenue even at half the 56k price about 33 billion dollars"
"I looked up the FDA situation on the alz drug, the market reaction, and mostly Biogen’s own current repertoire on other drug formulations. Looking thereafter at it’s PE multiple and the usual market creep back, I’m taking the plunge! Am prepared to hold over a five year horizon! This is a dividend paying company. Am I wrong! Biotech is a new sector for me, but there are strong elements of future success here!"
Time to switch over to SAVA
Don't trust this positive movement... This will crash big time.. A lot of things happening around the drug approval... Very likely it will be rescinded.... This is going back to 100s
"The amyloid hypothesis has weak validity. Some people with brains filled with amyloid and “tangles’ have normal intelligence. This is why 3 scientists resigned from the panel approving the Biogen Med feeling it was just a political decision and not a scientific one. This will lead to a waste of billions of $ on marginal meds, including Lilly’s. The real meds with curative clout are still being researched by AVXL and ANVS. A concerned MD."
"FDA is calling for federal investigation into approval of their Alhzeimer drug, time to buy."
Congress members who ask for information of who what when why did the FDA did what it did sounds like a joke!! It?s the #$%$ FDA for hells sake!! For every scientific opinion against Aduhelm there are scientists with reasons for!! Congress members themselves will be on this eventually. The FDA has never been under mined before and it won?t again. In this case we must retrial every aspect of Supreme Court decisions as well. What a circus act this has alll become
Ban2401 gets great press and is further along in phase 3. So why does lly pop and biib sink?
"I had to use my common sense and pharmalogical background here. SAVA is the Holy Grail for Alzheimer's Disease. I can predict Biogen's future, when the first court case begins for damaging the brain further. I just sold all my Biogen shares and tripled my SAVA shares! SAVA is the clear Winner here!"
Why did this stock run up recently? I forgot already. Please remind me to put a buy order when it's below $250 so that I can profit again from the next hype cycle.
SAVA had to now be in acquisition sights of Biogen given SAVA press release yesterday and potential excellent Alzheimer’s progress. Maybe a target SAVA price of $100???
"As I replied to sandi (which message she deleted), although price may drop further, no question this year’s trend will be higher. Company has strong financials; and regarding imminent pipeline drugs, extremely positive company comments can be heard on the Biogen website: Stifel CNS Day. Their Ban2401 AD treatment, now in phase 3 trials, may receive early approval. This company is poised for a 50% pop! ... regardless of aducanumab."
"ELY is a step later than biib; they are using a similar approach of anti-body. It would be 1-2 years before ELY's drug can be approved. At this time, biib already occupies the market, just like Viagra. No worries about competition from ELY. Hold on biib."
Sls just started hiring for manufacturing for cancer drug to treat 20 different types of cancer signaling to investors they know fda approval coming. 20-40x coming and they just announced surprise updates to occur 8/17
I just bought 10k at $297.00
I bought Biogen right before the good news and then I got out around 400 and did well - The question is what do I do know? Any advice
SAVA in the drivers seat.
will earnings be a miss???will they revise future earnings since the drug is a bust? will this head back to 250 range or lower??is a 20% drop or more out of the question at earnings?? will earnings from other revenues be lower?? asking for a friend 
Irrespective of SAVA’s simufilam- which isn’t an amyloid antagonist- and also not a silver bullet. The AZ community needs drugs like Aduhelm to clear the plaques. Just like in cancer u need to rid the tumor . U don’t argue whether the tumor was caused by this or that. U remove the tumors first. In order for this amyloid theory to really give solid answers patients on the 1000s need to get on these drugs. Means billions for these companies. I can’t understand how the market is missing this crucial point.
"I'm starting an investigation on the salary that Democratic Congressman Frank Pallone, Jr. of New Jersey, and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York, make. I believe they are overpaid and should take a 60% pay cut. Join me to get these overpaid politicians pay cut."
"Wow.... Panel rejects it and it's just down 0.71%.......How did it go up 45% ?????? Practically, shouldn't this go down more than 45%? It's a drug failure...."
"What is likely Biogen's biggest near-term threat ?SAVA reporting robust 9 month Simufilam cognition, behavior and safety data on Thursday, July 29th, at the AAIC.Hedge thy self.........Buying SAVA IMO would be a perfect hedge for BIIB and LLY shareholders.Good luck to all :)"
Aduhelm's limited Mild AD label and high rates of painful brain swelling (*40%) in clinical trials gives SAVA's Simufilam a huge advantage in the global AD market upon approval. The Stock Market is speaking...Are you listening to its message ?
"Like I said, nothing to see here. Sorry shorts, will be back over $400 in not time. Analysts following Biogen stock see little reason for concern over the request made by the acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an investigation into the agency's approval of the company's Alzheimer's therapy.The request was an acknowledgment of the widespread concerns raised by the nod the agency gave the drug in early June. Biogen shares dropped 3% on Friday, but the view on Wall Street is that the investigation won't have a long-term impact on the stock.""We believe that no matter what the outcome of the investigation, we think it is unlikely to influence the uptake of the drug,"" Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a note out Friday.In a separate note, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote that the request for an investigation ""is another controversy to deal with,"" but said he expects any investigation to determine that the FDA had the authority to give the approval it gave, ""allowing markets to move on from this chapter."""
"Why by aduhelm for $56,000 a year when you can by a bat and smack yourself in the head a bunch of times and receive the same benefit. Brain swelling and bleeding and it will probably only cost you $20"
"I have been a shareholder for the past three years, I’ve seen the roller coaster of this stock.. Currently have a substantial portion of my stock holdings is in Biogen. If you examine Biogen earnings and Extremely low PE, you can recognize that stock is very undervalued. This stock should be trading in the 325-335 range, just alone on the earnings and that would bring it PE more in line to other competitive companies...Biogen has many drugs they are working on besides Aducamaub. People are so forcused in Aducamaub that Biogen is trading at a discount. If Aducamaub does get approved then the stock will go to low 400’s. In my opinion, I think it will get approval from FDA with some conditions. Since there are no drugs out in the world to treat Alzheimer’s, this drug Aducamaub is a start to help slow the process down...Biogen should go up gradually, far to cheap for a 15Billion dollar company with a PE of 8..."
I think it is near to the bottom. has been droping for one week. ouch.
Meanwhile SAVA is up 28% today. Go figure!
If a drug has severe side effects why would the developer give it for free. Because people have been scared of this drug .. once a few hundred people start and no major issues the news will spread
Shorts will be on  soon. This is not a startup company that may have nothing on the market!
$BIIB loaded the boat. OVERSOLD
Biogen likely to win approval for Alzheimer's drug: Jefferies (source: Seeking Alpha)
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fed-up-with-washington-als-advocates-consider-act-ups-take-no-prisoners-approach/Talk to bcli. Best you can do for yourselves and als.
too expensive and too much room for a drop. their other medications aren't doing so hot either.I hope it turns around. I'm heavily loaded in SAVA. GL all!
Sold all shares and now short BIIB. Adu might be rejected.......
"The best outcome here is that Biogen catalyzes competition to create real, functional therapeutics and prevention drugs to treat this horrible, dehumanizing disease. In the meantime BIIB is a short and the best way to play it is to sell ST ratio short call spreads to collect premium...and if it goes up $5-7, sell the long call for more than you paid for it at expiration and let the short OTM call expire. In other words, the risk and trend is to the downside."
"No way the earnings call isn't filled with Hopium and good guidance for Aduhelm.You've not listened to the previous calls if you think anything else. October $350 calls extra cheap, get 'em now."
Price target is still over $400; good time to buy
drug should never have gotten approval.. GL with federal investigation
Biogen tumbles as FDA chief calls for a probe on Alzheimer’s drug approval
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Thetraderguide.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
"Biogen is extremely honest, non corrupt, non political and very kind hearted company."
"$BIIB I'm adding with both hands    This is like free money hereInvestors, however, are overlooking Biogen’s portfolio of drugs for multiple sclerosis, skin aliments, and rheumatoid arthritis"
a lot shorts now. it is a good sign to buy more
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is widely believed to be driven by the production and deposition of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). This has been addressed in any textbooks in Biochemistry and is also taught by the professors in any medical schools in the world. Right now all the drugs including the ""seemingly effective"" Silmufilm from SAVA , which the company can only show its effectiveness using ""open label"" trials to boost its stock price (Weird to me!), has to be tested to prove its effectiveness by measuring the size of the plaques. Therefore, anyone who claimed that the Biogen's drug is invalid is totally ignorant about the science behind the horrible disease. Of course, whether the building up of the plaques is the only factor or one of the multiple factors that causes the memory loss in the disease is another issue, which needs to be further explored in the future clinical trials. Currently, no scientist can stand out to answer the question."
"A series of biochemical experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). In the presence of healthy levels of hydrogen sulphide, GSK3β typically acts as a signalling molecule, adding chemical markers to other proteins and altering their function. However, the researchers observed that in the absence of hydrogen sulphide, GSK3β is over-attracted to another protein in the brain called Tau."
"Guys do we actually think this is going to go lower now??My chart tells me that 345 is the floor, we have tested it soo many times and it looks unlikely we'll break it. Support at 345 also comes from uptrending support from 250, and also the classic bull flag from the sharp rise."
Aduhelm is dead in the water. Just face it. Been in health care most of my life
"fast tract designation of EILY LILLY RX for ALZEIMER doesn't mean FDA, approval of this RX,"
54k for a treatmentyou'll see a reflection in your insurance premiums and taxes. who else do you think is paying for this?? the insurance companies??? hahahahawhere do they get their money from? you think they are going to lose out from their bottom line.wait till biogen gets criminal charges for bribes. secret backroom meetings with fda officials
I heard about BIIB the other day on (http://newlife-stockalerts.tech). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"So much for all those 400 and 450 price targets last month...Perfect example of why analysts don't know any more than you do. They're just overpaid researchers doing the same thing that any joe shmo on the street can can, and getting the same info thats available anywhere on the web."
could biogen go to 600 if aduhelm works
Green in a sea of red today!
Here’s the BEAR FLAG breaking down. This will close below $345. Mark this post.
"The streak of bad luck continues for aducanumab (Aduhelm), as the VA decided not to add the new Alzheimer's drug to its formulary and even recommended against offering it. (Endpoints News)"
Lot more downside.
"Again, irrational markets. A 2nd Biogen drug for AlZ gets a thumbs up from the FDA, and we sell off! Lily’s anti amyloid drug also got a nod from the FDA today, reiterating the efficacy of the data against amyloid! What the studies show is putting out the fire after the forest has burned doesn’t return it to its original splendor.Removing the fire as soon as it’s ignited can save the forest!Getting the plaques out as soon as the show up has been proven to slow the decline- to what extent- that’s why the approval was so needed so we can answer that- and that’s why it was a broad approval with no restrictions.This is 1000 dollar stock!"
"I got out to be safe. This is so unfair to Biogen as two days before July 2nd they said they would negotiate on price. Now, without any facts the insinuation is there is nefarious dealings with the approval of this drug. It gives hope is the reason for approval when there was none before."
started peak on June 10 and continue to drop for three weeks. it is time to be stable and make U turn..
"This won't have massive implications. The investigation is only seeking clarity and no doubt biogen will give that stated clarity, along with the FDAThis is only to calm down anyone anxious and to deal with the pricing situation. A drop in pricing outright imo is unlikely, only more exceptions for lower pricing which is priced into stock already"
"I hope its true that ""[t]he accelerated approval was based on very solid grounds,"" or else this stock is going to tank."
They are right- Adami is the better of these guys on CNBC but they do not know much about this science. Cathie's Ark@cathiesark·Jun 28Just saw @GuyAdami on @CNBC comparing the $NTLA pop to $BIIB's a few weeks ago. Did we already forget that the drug $BIIB popped on barely works? Apples and oranges
"Grab your money while you can. Once they realize our product doesn't work, it's going to tank."
"BIIB BEATS EXPECTATIONS MORE THAN A DOLLAR IN EARNINGS REPORT. That’s amazing, how many companies can top 25%?"
What are everyone's thoughts about the FDA reviewing Biogens emergency approval?
Any news drop this 100$ today
This is about to drop really hard. 100% closing Below $350
"2 largely overlooked biotechs in AD, PD prevention/cure BioVie Inc. (BIVI) --- BIVI's NE3107, a selective inhibitor of inflammatory ERK signaling that reduces neuroinflammation. It is an orally administered first-in-class small molecule that inhibits inflammation-driven insulin resistance and major pathological inflammatory cascades with a novel mechanism of action. There is emerging scientific consensus that both inflammation and insulin resistance play fundamental roles in the development of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, and NE3107 could represent an entirely new medical approach to treating these devastating conditions affecting an estimated 6 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s and 1 million from Parkinson’s. The FDA recently authorized a pivotal US Phase 3 clinical trial for NE3107.AC Immune (ACIU) --- Robust and diverse pipeline of nine therapeutic and three diagnostic product candidates has the potential to greatly improve the treatment of a broad spectrum of Alzheimer’s and neurodegenerative diseases.

$BIIB I'm ADDING heavy at these prices today. Unbelievable
"If you read the FDA report, you'll find that they have a strong case in favor of drug approval that totally disagrees with ADCOM.It is true that the FDA generally follows the committee's recommendation, but based on historical cases where the agency strongly disagrees with the panel advisor, they rarely follow his recommendation.See what happened to Tarceva, a lung cancer drug, in 2010. The advisory panel voted 12-1 against recommending approval for the wider use of Tarceva, but the FDA, as in this case, had a very positive position on the Tarceva and approved the drug anyway ... guess what ... FDA was right because today Tarceva is a successful drug that makes billions each year."
"Just a question of time for increase use. By next earnings report Biogen will show atleast 50,000 Americans on the drug- that’s billions already ."
"I saw a post earlier (I can’t remember who) about the cost of this disease. Everyone is all over the annual cost of this drug. We are currently trying to find a memory care home for my Mother-In-Law. The places were looking at have ranged from $9,000-$15,000 per month. Still think $56K a year is expensive?"
"Nobody is going to pay $65,000 for the snake oil Alzheimer drug period."
$BIIB NICE LARGE BLOCK buys coming in. SMART money knows. Let's take her back to the $340s by next Friday then move from there.
"2. BiogenBiogen has already made one acquisition this year. The company closed on its $800 million buyout of Nightstar Therapeutics in early June. While the pickup of the small gene therapy biotech bolsters Biogen's pipeline, there are plenty of reasons why its shopping spree could continue.Sales are slipping for Biogen's multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise. The biotech's five MS drugs generate around 57% of total revenue. Royalties from Roche's (NASDAQOTH: RHHBY) sales of MS drug Ocrevus help somewhat, but Ocrevus also hurts some of Biogen's other MS drugs. Biogen's total revenue continues to increase, with year-over-year revenue up 11% in the first quarter. That growth is being driven primarily by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug Spinraza. The bad news for Biogen is that Spinraza now has competition with the recent FDA approval of Novartis' (NYSE: NVS) SMA gene therapy Zolgensma.Shareholders had hoped that Biogen's Alzheimer's disease drug aducanumab would live up to its hype as a potential game changer. However, the drug flopped in late-stage clinical studies.Biogen still has money to spend on acquisitions, though. It reported $5.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of the end of March, although the total didn't reflect the cash spent on the Nightstar deal."
"Sorry, but they will suffer from thus rush….the drug isn’t ready. I like Biogen. Tecfidera has really been great for me, but they rushed this and it’s not effective."
Something must have leaked. Unusual to drop this much
What is the latest with the FDA approval?
"Thanks to BIIB, finally some hope treating Alzheimer's patients!

Back to $360
"Mylan's early launch of a generic of Tecfidera, Biogen's biggest-selling drug, will take a bite out revenue, but the biopharma has another potential blockbuster on its hands in the Alzhemier's disease drug aducanumab, analysts at SVB Leerink say. The analysts cut their Tecfidera sales forecasts for this year and next, but they reiterate their outperform rating on the stock, saying they believe the FDA will approve aducanumab, taking the shares much higher. The agency earlier this month granted priority review status to aducanumab, with a decision due by early March. SVB trims its Biogen price target by $8 to $342 to account for Mylan's early generic launch."
"WSJ, Friday August 6 : “Could the COVID Vaccine (and Others) Prevent Alzheimer’s?” . Very interesting article which discusses studies that indicate lifetime vaccinations lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s (by up to 60%). Worth a read! …still much more to learn about AD control and prevention."
Predictions of any news released on Monday?
imagine buying biogen lmao
"ps. The head of the,FDA is calling for an investigation into her own department to find out information. Imagine the head of safety at a company asking the CEO to investigate why safety broke down. He would be fired on the spot. And people wonder why the country is coming apart."
"Bio gen below $230is a good buy. Bought more before the close at $229.75. With a current PE around 10 and a forward PE below 8, the risk factor is low. BIIB still have a strong pipe line moving forward. Great people at the helm."
Could Biogen plummet to around $200 or so if Congress and the FDA decide to pull Aduhelm from the market ? Time will tell.
This looks like positive news. I don't understand the reaction.
"Kevin; your point is misguided. It's true that these drugs will reduce amyloid build up but that's if you start taking them in your 30""s or 40's; that's the science. The FDA approval was wrong and initially gave false hope to those who have nothing else to look forward to other than no quality of life. With the re- labeling and the visceral criticism from many medical and scientific experts about the Aduhelm approval, let's hope that the next iteration of similar treatments will be much more effective, lower priced and worthy of approval by the politicized FDA. That's why I shorted Biogen big time 3 weeks ago."
"BIIB's sell off should be expected and should continue given that Aduhelm FAILED.... to improve cognition in their P3 trials; an alarming 40% of patients experienced painful brain swelling, and the cost of treatment is extremely expensive. For example, Dr Constantine Lyketsos, the director of the Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center at Johns Hopkins said that Aduhelm treatment costs are about ""$100,000"" a year, per patient due to safety monitoring and MRIs. Add it all up, it's not surprising that most global HC Payers are not giving the green light to Aduhelm...Again, BIIB's Aduhelm launch problems were caused by the FDA, for approving a treatment that was overwhelmingly rejected by the expert ADCOM panel."
"by law, medicaid and medicare must cover fda accelerated approval drugs. private payers like BC/BS usually cover but with some limits. 90% of AA pts fall into Medicare/MS. expect 100,000 to 200,000 to get it in m/m."
There’s 6 people left posting on this board. They’re the only 6 people that haven’t covered yet. The ironic part is they post about morality as they’re trying to deceive people.
"Drip Drip Drip every day, till $270ishand then below $250ish."
"The stock market for SAVA looks insane. The clinical trial they performed was totally unblinded, i.e., the data would be easy to be manipulated. However, so many investors rush to buy the stocks from them and totally neglect the results from the double blinded trials from Biogen which has tested more than 3000 patients. This is really ridiculous. Tomorrow we will see how SAVA stock price plummets (Warning: I am guessing so you don't need to follow my words .What ever results from SAVA are, they are both positive to the stock price of Biogen in the long run. Let us see."
"The bottom line:1) FDA approved the drug2) It is the only drug for AD3) It is expensive4) Insurance does not want to pay. Insurance has no problem being paid. On this board most people are associating their opinion with the way they invested their money. Bashers and pumpers are equally ignorant and opportunist. Side effects exist with every drug. No drug is 100% efficient. Doctors have different opinions and fear being sued. When Europe approves the drug, the price will shoot up 30% to 50%. If they dont approve then it is already factored in. I stand long and I am aware I could lose 15% to 30%"
"The P3 data analysis by BIIB is not as complicated as some say. I wonder they truly studied BIIB's analysis of P3 (Emerge & Engage). Simply put, the data from the participants who got Adu at a high dose for a sufficient amount of time clearly show that Adu is efficacious. Only issue is that such an analysis is not a GOLD standard in GLP. But considering unmet demand, I think, Adu will be probably approved by the FDA despite a split decision by ADCOM. The agency granted Priority Review w/o Vouch only a month after Biogen submitted the application. It is unprecedented. Furthermore, the regulatory agency also said they are planning to expedite the review process further if possible. This clearly shows the FDA is willing to approve Adu with imperfect clinical data. In my previous life, I have been successfully involved in commercializing several drugs. And I am confident of my prediction: > 75% approval chances!"
We need to worry more about competition . Aduhelm has Donanemab and Roches new therapy .. but the biggest threat is Lecanemab because it’s an at home infusion - And guess who owns 50% of the profits of that company- BIOGEN!!!!
shorts will short anything...they are omnivorous...Biogen gets no free pass...
"It appears that there is a strong back and forth between Biogen and the FDA. I remember submitting scientific papers for publication, and the back and forth on the data. I have PTSD from rewrites!!! Sometimes we'd have to revise 2-3 times. But usually if a paper was going to be rejected they did it on the first time. Like a draw in chess, they see no path to checkmate, or no path to consider the findings valid. From what I read it seems that some complicated ninja moves were made with statistical analysis. So to me the back and forth gives me hope, like the Lloyd Christmas rule: ""So you're saying there's a chance!!!"" I remember AMGN being pushed down before it shot up, and I wonder if this is similar. If there is a novel medication that can treat Alzheimer's disease that would be so amazing for the people and families who suffer with this devastating disease. So I am long, but I'm also rooting for Biogen to make this breakthrough. Caveat this is my opinion and my opinion only!!! I mean, I'm no Jim Cramer. Also, they are getting ready to defend another patent, so I think that is weighing on the stock."
"People don't even want this dangerous drug for free...Doesn't that tell you something???? Get out while you can and buy the real winner, SAVA!"
BIIB supposed to report earnings tomorrow morning
The fact that there is no longer a lot of commentary here is a good sign the selling has diminished. I think we’re marching a lot higher from here
So glad I escaped in the $420's here. Sad what they do to this stock.
Don’t panic with premarket drops. BIIB will earn $32 next year with all bad news recently excluding Aducanumabs. If you value investors BIIB is good company and if you can average out your price that would be great don’t sell at a big loss because it’s still 50/50 chance. FDA knows what they are doing they might agree with their peers when others don’t agrees.
"Ionis shareholder here. Hey Biogen, where’s our tofersen data?"
Amazing how they manipulate price to stay under 300. Buy
"can’t believe you all are getting bullish here… enjoy holding that bag once the hearings start. This company, and the FDA are under investigation. A child can tell you the data shows no changes. The launch is ruined anyway, and patients won’t be able to afford it."
"I see BIIB in the same boat as where Celgene (Celg) was prior to the announcement of being acquired by Bristol Myers (BMY). Both CELG and BIIB were of similar size. Both had a major drug trial fail (BIIB in Alzheimer's; Celgene in Crohn's disease). Both have strong pipelines outside of the singular fail. Both had their stock prices crushed from that one fail. I think acquiring BIIB would make a lot of sense for a company like J&J, Merck, or Pfizer. The Board of Directors at BIIB would sign-off on any deal at or above $310/share (biotech firms sell at a typical premium of 40-to-50%) given that the public markets seem unwilling to price the company at fair value in the foreseeable future. A $310/share price would still have BIIB at just 10 times forward earnings (and around 13.4 times trailing 12 months earnings. This is a great deal for shareholders at Merck, JNJ or Pfizer that are all valued at close to 15 times forward earnings. With some reasonable cuts on Biogen's SG&A costs, any of these three potential acquirers could make a Biogen acquisition accretive to earnings (EPS) on a forward 12 month basis. Opinions on my line of thinking?"
"Medicare will likely go with this criteria for coverage (about 5% of the 6 M USA Alz pts): ""Doctors have shown strong interest in prescribing Aduhelm for about 35% of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients with mild cognitive impairment, Jefferies analysts found after surveying 50 U.S. neurologists or psychiatrists who currently treat about 12,000 Alzheimer’s patients.The rate suggests “good planned uptake” of the med compared with Wall Street’s expectations, the Jefferies team noted. If that enthusiasm pans out in the long run, it could mean at least 300,000 patients taking the drug, or $10 billion to $15 billion in peak Aduhelm from U.S. sales alone, which is above consensus estimates of around $7 billion to $8 billion, the team said.https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biogen-s-aduhelm-despite-controversy-could-see-10b-to-15b-u-s-sales-alzheimer-s-doctors"
Now closer to the low of the year than the high... :-(
"a big drop today, but also opportunity to buy"
"Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) and Eisai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended the review period by three months for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for aducanumab, an investigational treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The updated Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date is June 7, 2021."
"Lilly hits 200b market value and still in green, but Biogen only 55B, but in red. what is going here stock market? load up BIIB."
$BIIB Ye just gave a $500 price target on @cnbc minutes ago!
This is done. $200 !!
"AD drug gets revenue, also collects feedbacks from patients. it is only hope for AD patients now. buy at this low price."
The FDA did a right thing for AZD patients. I am convinced that ADU will be shown to be efficacious in phase 4. The FDA was right about Sarepta's drug. Many are jealous about BIIB's making money with the first AZ drug.
thank you $biib for the dip
$BIIB Guy Adami recommended it A BUY yesterday. EXTREMELY BULLISH TODAY.
"Please consider all the naysayers and data scientists and physicians who are against approval are using the mixed trial results as their only reason, they don’t have access to the additional data submitted to the FDA by Biogen since then!Clearly clearly in March 2021 when the FDA said they need 3 more months to reviews, Means they got more data from Biogen. Obviously that data is positive why would Biogen give them negative data and the FDA push this 3 months.The additional data was positive and is only available to the FDA and the extra 3 months was to review that positive data in light with all other info. This is getting approved obviously!"
Do hospitals have a the authority not to carry certain medications. Isn’t that gong against patients and the FDA. Can’t they be sued by patients?
I was dead on with the short I put on at $440back to 2 Handel soon.
"Medicare approval to follow next week due to relabel, this is a huge plus. No we can await European approval"

"This stock is a gem at these prices.If you have done your due deligence.. Whatever the share price now is meaningless..Take a look at $Biib..Inspite of how controversial it's drug was,it got FDA approval..Sens product isn't new,it's just an update on it..It's already approved in the EU and it's in use..So approval is not if..It's only when..."
I heard about BIIB the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Better not to buy axsm
"""The accelerated approval was based on very solid grounds,"" Woodcock said during Stat's Breakthrough Science Summit. However, she said, ""It is possible the process could have been handled in a way that would have decreased the amount of controversy involved."" (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell in New York and Trisha Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)Translation, nothing is going to come of the investigation."
"https://endpts.com/adcomm-member-who-warned-about-risk-of-approving-biogens-aducanumab-has-resigned-following-historic-ok-reports/One of the 11 experts the FDA had convened to discuss Biogen’s aducanumab — before overriding their recommendation and approving the Alzheimer’s drug — has resigned from the panel, STAT News and Pink Sheet reported.Joel Perlmutter, a neurologist at the Washington University in St. Louis who’s been on the Peripheral & Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee roster since 2015, told STAT that he quit on Monday “due to this ruling by the FDA without further discussion with our advisory committee.”The adcomm’s opinion was near-unanimous: When asked whether it is reasonable to consider the positive Phase III Biogen submitted “as primary evidence of effectiveness” for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, 10 voted no, none said yes and one abstained. During the full-day session last November, experts excoriated both the company and the agency for what they saw as insufficient data and a biased presentation of information.advertisementadvertisementAt one point, Perlmutter warned that an approval for aducanumab could push back a truly effective treatment “for more than a couple of years, for many years.”“Alzheimer’s treatment is a huge, urgent, unmet need, but I also think if we approve something where the data is not strong, we have a risk of delaying good treatment,” he was quoted as saying.The FDA’s historic approval of aducanumab was a resounding victory for Biogen, which stands to gain billions in revenue from the drug, now dubbed Aduhelm, with a broad label priced at $56,000 per year. While patient advocacy groups and some leading neurologists hailed the milestone, others decried possible false hope and expressed concerns about the precedent that regulators have now set regarding everything from the validity of beta-amyloid as an Alzheimer’s target to the threshold for clinical evidence.Biogen has nine years to complete the confirmatory trial."
Sls Sellas Life Sciences about to 20-40x on pending FDA approval for cancer drug GPS to treat 20 different types of cancer. Company just started hiring for manufacturing on website showing their hand that they know FDA approval is on the way or they wouldn’t be hiring now. Analyst are jumping on board and institutions buying now in front of approval . Huge short squeeze just starting as news of hiring for manufacturing and lots of other great news leaks into market for very under the radar company. Sls is the future of cancer treatment. Look into company and u will see this is all true.
"Worth the gamble now. The stock price is already assuming the failure of Alz. drug and thus the down tread is limited. However, if the drug is approved in a month or so, the gain will be 50% or more. The risk is limited but the reward is sky high."
Once a drug is approved by FDA it can not be taken back!!
"They are probing the PRICE not the approval. Warren Buffett owns 643,00 shares, $224 MILLION worth as of close today. Nothing to see here. THE DRIG WORKS. Try harder shorts. ADDING"
It's obvious now and the reason this drug was approved. It gives a person a chance when there was none before.
Management is expected to discuss the commercialization plans for Aduhelm on the second-quarter conference call and maybe mention the initial sales number.
Complete overreaction !!!
Some people like probes
"let give it for free, and it will show the efficiency. no bad strategy."
"Timber!! Expert medical panel, recently said AD drug offers no improvement over std care."
"well, I guess the Alzheimer's drug market is huge, so there's room for many drugs"
"Added 534 shares. Youre basically getting the stock without the Alzheimer's drug at this price, and the Alzheimer’s drug could become over 60% of its profits by the end of next year"
"The SEC should launch an investigation: news today Jul-09 leaked 6 minutes before publication. Stock began decline 12:53, news 12:59."
Everyone expected this drug would not be approved.It has been. It's been a company saver.Why do people suddenly think its going down to old price of 280?? It can't be taken off the market until at least the confirmatory trials are undergone in a few years time.
Gap at $270ish must be filled.
SAVA in phase 3 will take years. As it doesn’t eliminate a bio marker like amyloid. It’ll have to prove to the FDA that it has clinical benefits. This won’t hit the market for 2-3 years.
"“ … But the Alzheimer’s Association’s focus on awareness — some would call it fear-based messaging — is consistent with what psychiatrist Susan Molchan says she sees from disease advocacy organizations that have financial ties to drug companies – and the Alzheimer’s Association currently lists six pharmaceutical companies among its national corporate sponsors. Although dated, a report on the Alzheimer’s Association website listed 31 pharmaceutical, insurance and diagnostic corporate donors in 2012. These companies collectively were responsible for some $4.2 million in revenue for the association in that year. And this group of sponsors donated some $20 million from 2008 through 2012, the report notes.” -health news review"

"I can kind of see why it got a negative reaction. It would put a huge burden on the insurance industry / medicare as half of the population would eventually take it at $50K per year, yet it was not proven to be effective enough to be confident those same people wouldn't soon need assisted living care anyway. And then what, are you going to make them choose between the medication that might help a little and the assisted care they need? Now you have doubled the costs to take care of these seniors.If it were really effective and could allow seniors to live on their own, then maybe it could justify the price. I know the cost vs. benefit shouldn't necessarily factor into the FDA review, but the people on the board have to be able to see the end result..."

"This is an excerpt in a Barrons article regarding the Mylan patent dispute with Biogen ...Mizuho’s Salim Syed reiterated a Buy rating and $427 price target on the stock, writing that while the development presents risks, and historical IPR data indicates Biogen has probably a 31% chance of losing the patent protection, in reality that figure could be much lower for two reasons. First, there’s the fact that Tecfidera has already triumphed in past intellectual-property litigation, and secondly, as the petitioner, the onus is on Mylan to win all of the 20 claims related to this dispute; Biogen needs only to win one claim to be successful."
Time to short more !!
"The drug itself is not in question as far as being pulled from the market. Biogen released a statement on the 23rd that they are open to price reduction. I thought too that price drop would be steeper after hours as is normally the case when mentioning hearings. However, there are no accusations of wrongdoing on BIO's part. Also, any hope with Alz. is better than no hope."

Positive biib analyst coming up on CNBC. Let's see if it'll move the needle
This company is selling an inferior product with horrible side effects at an astronomical cost; of course it will tank.
"I’d the anti amyloid theory shows promise after a few years, u can absolutely bet on it Biogen will develop a pill version u take once or twice a day at home without hospital visits! If this can be achieved we have basically reduced Alzheimer’s into a chronic condition much like diabetes and HIV.The FDA was enormously compassionate with the approval as they are allowing people to try try . What is there to lose, nothing but billions of dollars. So what. People over Money isn’t that what we want government to show !!And everyone has their panties in a knot!"
Should BIIB buy SAVA?
Let’s not hate biogen or the drug companies for such big prices. It’s incentive for them to bring cures that are badly needed. They atleast got something to market! Lilly data shows more conclusively that riding plaques can have a substantial difference to disease progression!
Why is the stock down so much after hrs??
"Ready to launch. Biogen is ready to immediately launch aducanumab in more than 600 clinical sites in the U.S. if given the FDA's go ahead in June, with “many more” sites in the works, CEO Michel Vounatsos told analysts on an earnings call Thursday. In fact, the company expects strong demand for aducanumab out the gate."
still keep tracking AD sale. and patient feedback. keep finger cross
This is a big win today for the amyloid hypothesis stocks. Especially with the FDA advisory prima-donnas questioning efficacy. This is a win for both Biogen & Lilly.
Biogen themselves have said they won’t only people with early onset to get on this medication. But what the market isn’t realizing that overtime of all the newly diagnosed cases get on Aduhelm. Means in 5-7 years mostly all cases will be on Aduhelm as the late stage victims would have succumbed.. It means in 15 years every new case of Alzheimer’s will be on some anti amyloid treatment.This a blockbuster drug waiting to absolutely explode!
Anyone knows what is happening? Biogen at the Morgan Stanley 19th Annual Global Healthcare Conference@9:30 am
This is no longer about unmet need/. We have Aduhelm. Just because Donanemab is equal to Aducanumab doesn’t mean it’s equally safe. The biogen trials had far more people so the safety data is more abound. The Lilly trials had fewer people. The FDA will want more data on safety not efficacy!!
there was a big reaction to dropping the trials of that drug. those trials being dropped will bring money back to the bottom line overall unless reinvested. the hope premium on the stock for that drug should be gone i think the earnings premium will make this a buy here and there will be more good news out of BIIB with their robust financial data. this is on sale.
Digesting / held most its ground on the approval. Deserves to be much higher since likely to be one of the most profitable drugs of all time. It is good news for patients given that it will drive competition to take share from Biogen.

He believes the advocacy by patients and their families may press the agency to allow the drug, while requiring Biogen to continue trials after approval.]]https://www.barrons.com/articles/biogen-stock-gave-back-last-weeks-gains-whats-next-51604963396?siteid=yhoof2"
I think what people are not realizing is the Aduhelm and Donanemab are not intended for the AZ community of 6 million. But for the ageing population 55 plus who have plaque but no signs of cognitive decline just yet. That market is 50 million strong. Think of it like Prep for HIV! Or Rogaine for people who have not yet lost hair. It’s a preventative approach that works not curative. That’s a far bigger market worldwide than a cure for AZ!!When will the market realize that???? When the trials further elucidate the effectiveness as a prophylactic treatment !This will then see 100 billion sales world wide. 2025-2027 Biogen will be a 150 billion company
"If the US government and FDA decide to pull Aduhelm from the market, will BIIB then plummet and retest its 52-week low ? This has to be a major concern for longs going forward."
"As you know, the Alzheimer’s Association has advocated strongly for approval of aducanumab, now called Aduhelm, which received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 7. This treatment, while not a cure, has the potential to give more time to those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s or those with early stage Alzheimer’s dementia. Thanks to your strong support of our work in so many ways, this is the first treatment ever to achieve such approval to address Alzheimer’s disease itself, not just the symptoms. Since I last communicated with you about the approval, much has happened. The FDA has now clarified the people who would likely benefit from this new treatment. It is the same group I described above and the group that the Alzheimer’s Association has advocated to have access to this treatment throughout the approval process. Achieving access to treatment for those who would likely benefit is now our focus. Regrettably, Biogen, the company that developed Aduhelm, priced it at $56,000 annually. That is simply unacceptable. The Alzheimer’s Association continues to call on the company to change that price. To fail to do so would deny access for many who could benefit. To achieve access for this treatment, and other treatments that will one day follow, the Alzheimer’s Association is committed to working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as health insurance companies and others in the private payer community, to expedite coverage and access. You might have also heard that there have been multiple calls for investigation of the approval process for Aduhelm. The Alzheimer’s Association strongly supports such inquiries to reassure all of us that treatment approval processes work the way they should. We firmly believe that the FDA’s accelerated approval was the right decision, given the publicly available science, especially for such a devastating and fatal disease — one that otherwise has no treatment to even slow it down. Having the availability of such an option and access to it are needs we’ve long heard from the patient and caregiver community that we serve. You can be assured that the Alzheimer’s Association will continue to advocate for coverage of this now approved treatment for everyone who is likely to benefit. Thank you so much for all of your support to make it possible to improve the lives of so many others! Sincerely,Harry Johns SignatureHarry JohnsChief Executive Officer"
Adios my beloved BIIB! Remember when screwing your employees? Letting them go just a few weeks before their stocks vested?

Sls 20x on cancer drug to treat 20 types of cancer. Yesterday company started hiring for manufacturing on Sellas life sciences website signaling they know fda approval coming. This will be the stock of this century . 20 types of cancer that there are no good treatments for. All trials have been amazing.
LLY gained 16 billion in market cap today alone.BIIB has gained mere 10 billion in market cap since approval of AduhelmAmazing the logic with WS hates one but loves another
If todays reaction is positive. Would share price rocket today or on FDA approval?
It is worth noting that Bio stated Wednesday they would be willing to lower price.
"Alzforum published a summary of the BIIB080 Phase 1b results Friday, with several encouraging quotes from neuroscientists."
"In a note Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond brushed aside the worrying signals. Citing a survey of 74 neurologists, Raymond wrote that many still plan to prescribe the drug.""While docs continue to have misgivings around Aduhelm's clinical profile, intent to prescribe remains robust enough to meet or beat consensus in the near to intermediate-term,"" said Raymond, who has been critical of the FDA's decision to approve the drug.Raymond has a Buy rating on Biogen, and a $450 target price. The stock closed at $324.62 on Friday, and was down 0.8% in premarket trading on Monday. Shares closed as high as $414.71 in early June, days after the FDA approved Aduhelm, but the stock has slid in recent weeks. Still, shares are up 32.6% so far this year."
"So many people are doubting the the effectiveness of the Biogen alzheimer drug because they only focused failure of one of the two clinical trials. They never asked why the trial failed. In fact, it was due to the inappropriate dose of experimental drug when the trial was initiated. The subgroup in the trial that followed correct dose showed the similar positive results from the other trial. Right now many politicians, doctors, and some organizations step out claiming the drug should not be approved because the drug is useless. I wonder how they made such a conclusion. In the future trial, if the results can show that the drug can really slow down the progression of the disease for some patients, these guys would feel ashamed about what they did today."
All credibility lost with biib- fda padding pockets
"New hedge funds have added BIIB in the last 2 days , stock is on big discount now ,"
Why do we even have a FDA if they are constantly going to be challenged or discredited. More and more of this is evolving!
Nothing worse than well off 30-40 year olds getting a lifetime prescription of Aduhelm (covered by insurance) to prevent cognitive decline. That will surely put Biogen out of business.
SAVA is 50% off guys!
"Looks like the haters are going to lose their bass on BIIB shorts. Remember Medicare has to pay for aduhelm, it’s the law."
Brain bleeding drug design is why people mistrust your company and others along with the fda.
The best way to trade this stock is to buy at $250 and set a sell order at $350. Look at the chart. There're so many spikes due to favorable news and later reversion. Now is not any different.
The committee had found that the evidence did not convincingly show that Aduhelm could slow cognitive decline in people in the early stages of the disease — and that the drug could cause potentially serious side effects of brain swelling and brain bleeding. None of the 11 members of the committee considered the drug ready for approval: Ten voted against and one was uncertain.
INMB - Thank me later but do some research on this one.
"30% chance of brain swelling/bleeds, little efficacy, high cost ($56K/yr), expensive and painful administration IV. Office of the Inspector General investigating how this stuff was ever approved. 30% of the Advisory Board resigns and the remaining 70% voted ADU down. I sold my shares. Some of you must be paid pumpers or are smoking dope."
"Biogen drug removes plaque, a best marker for Alzheimer disease at least now, with some effect on slowing down on memory deterioration. If I I’m in early dementia and have that amount of money to spare, I will certainly take it. If Medicare pays some, even better. Without trying, the memory goes down quickly. I invest in biib, sava, avxl, anvi, because I may need down the road. Support them now and reap the benefits later."
I have early AZ diagnosis. think I'll wait 6 months or a year until maybe the LLY drug is out. Nobody said ever.
"CELG was acquired by BMY for $74B. CELG rev was $17/yr but an empty pipeline and drugs that going out of patent and plenty of debt and no cash. However, BIIB rev is $14B/yr but the pipeline is excellent, 1 pending approval, 6 drugs in phase 3, and 10 in phase 2, plus 9 in phase 1. For CELG, 74B/17B = 4.35 times rev. Even if this number is used for BIIB then the price would be $61B or $381/shr but BIIB has a rich pipeline and an AD blockbuster drug pending approval."
"I am a bit confused on the recent spike in pre-market due to the news that the review process will take 3 months longer due to the FDA requesting more data from Bigoen. That seems like bad news as originally, the FDA was quite optimistic on the initial filing. And one would have assumed that Biogen would have provided the best evidence they have in that filing.it seems like the FDA is asking for more evidence that supports the drug, but why would this evidence not have been provided in the first place if it was there?"
"With the exception of MRNA most of my drug stocks have been under attack even the good dividend ones such as ABBV, AMGN. I don’t get it!"
The relabel is a big plus.. because as a broad label people with advanced stages might not see benefits and the drug would be trashedIf mild cases don’t progress they would remain on it. And every year there would be new patients on it. Basically there would be very few advanced cases that mean millions of people on anti amyloid drugs
Bad news when law makers are looking into the approval on the new drug!!
"Despite all the controversy concerning its Alzheimer's drug, its the only company with an FDA approval.When it was approved, the stock went over 468. Will be buying every pullback."
"the drug reduces/eliminates plaques and plaques are the defining feature of AZ, indeed it is how it is diagnosed. so if you remove the plaques then by current definition you would no longer have AZ. the definition is likely flawed and the decline can only be slowed but that is the state of the art. so many cry babies act like there is no good science here but quite the other way around. many programs are following BIIB's lead."
Have the EU approved the drug?
Patients want the drug! No one can’t stop it now! Money is meaningless if you become a walking dead.?
The earnings and growth look too robust... yearly cashflow of 1/2 liabilities is a good place to be. i'll take a position hereish
"No matter how you look at it, less than 300 million market cap is too damn low for an AD drug company that has a viable drug (even if it does not work completely)AD is difficult to treat and $AVNS, $SAVA and $AVXL has shown they have a drug that at least works partially (just like $BIIB drug)"
just buy it
"ELEPHANT in the room is the EU approval, thats 1.5 billion pop. That’ll have atleast 5-7 million on Aduhelm and the like. The revenue ramp up is tooo insane to ignore. We are just up 30 percent or 2 p/es since approval. These are still very early days!Biogen buys back shares arm over fist. The money they will make could send their EPS north of 70.Again easily a 1000 stock"
Geez. What a surprise. The Socialists in the House want to control everything including the efficacy and price of a drug that shows promise against a deadly disease. Beauracracy at its best.
this will end when vast numbers of patient families sue biib into bankruptcy.
A billion in sales of Aduhelm next quarter and many feedback from patients will tell how effective Aduhelm will be? I believe early and mildly symptoms benefit the most. Still worth the money especially after discount and insurance negotiations will dropped significantly and probably around $40 grand
"With Aduhelm, history can repeat itself by following cancer’s successBy Andrew C. von Eschenbach July 29, 2021The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm has stirred intense controversy, with pundits launching attacks on multiple fronts. Professors focus on population outcomes rather than individual treatment responses; politicians worry about drug pricing rather than disease cost; critics pounce on the FDA’s narrowing of the drug’s label to reflect its clinical trial — all casting doubt on the drug’s effectiveness and value.What’s been lost in the flurry is an understanding of how progress against complex diseases advances — and the historic importance of Aduhelm as a first step in that process.Alzheimer’s robs people of memory, cognition, and the dignity of being human. It is a public health crisis that will eventually bankrupt every health care system challenged with financing institutionalized care for the coming wave of dementia patients. There is no cure and no standard therapy. The wasteland of research failures causes many investigators to shy from committing careers to Alzheimer’s, while the biopharmaceutical industry avoids the risk of futile investments of billions of dollars.This year, for the first time since Alzheimer’s was first described in 1906, the FDA granted what’s called accelerated approval for a drug with substantial evidence of affecting the underlying disease mechanism, though its effects on symptoms remains to be elucidated.Fifty years ago, when the National Cancer Act was passed, cancer posed much the same threat as Alzheimer’s disease poses today: no cure, only rudimentary understanding of the disease, and an enormous emotional and financial toll on families and society. Yet many forms of cancer are now amenable to cures or long periods of remission and control.This progress did not take place in one giant leap.In the earliest days of cancer chemotherapy, a modest response rate of 20% to 30% was celebrated as a victory, especially compared to zero. Those responses mattered because they exposed tumors’ vulnerabilities and offered hope for those who responded to treatment and their loved ones.As a cancer physician and former director of the National Cancer Institute, I believe the burden should be on critics to explain why we should not view biological responses to Aduhelm in people with Alzheimer’s the same way and follow the same road map to greater success.Early, tentative responses to new therapies mobilized the cancer community to a sustained effort at building on incremental progress. With patience, persistence, and the heroic participation of cancer patients who braved potential side effects, researchers and clinicians made astounding gains.In my own experience as a urologic oncologist, the results in widespread metastatic testicular cancer have been stunning. Once a virtual death sentence with no curative treatments, patients now experience an almost 100% survival rate utilizing a combination of chemotherapy agents.This history of progress in the fight against cancer shows that the FDA was right to approve Aduhelm — not as a silver bullet but as a first, essential step in climbing a mountain to success for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families.Researchers will eventually discern whether amyloid plaque is a cause of Alzheimer’s disease or an effect of it. But reduction of plaque is an essential observation — just as in a cancer trial where survival is the meaningful endpoint but tumor response is the critical observation because it shows researchers they are on a path that matters.The FDA has launched this journey for Alzheimer’s with the accelerated approval of Aduhelm. In fact, the agency has already taken the next step by granting Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s treatment, donanemab, breakthrough designation, which is intended for serious or life-threatening conditions in which preliminary clinical evidence supports a potential significant improvement over existing therapies.Aduhelm is not a silver bullet in the battle against Alzheimer’s, and the hand-wringing critics are wrong to hold it to that standard. The more productive route is to recognize the drug as a first treatment that can galvanize the scientific/medical community, industry, and patient advocates to begin the hard, step-by-step process that leads to better treatments and hopefully, one day, a cure. That’s the future we all wish for Alzheimer’s and all neurodegenerative diseases. That’s the effort we owe to desperate patients living in fear they will not recognize or remember the names of their loved ones.Andrew C. von Eschenbach is an oncologist, president of Samaritan Health Initiatives, former director of the National Cancer Institute, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and a member of the board of Wren Therapeutics.

"Once evidence comes forth that it works predominantly in early onset AZ only, everyone with plaques with or without AZ will won’t to get on board and that point I would assume the price would fall to 20k where a few million people can then take it. Again I can’t believe Biogen isn’t going to have revenues of 7 billion- 15 billion with this drug. Even with competition. The world isn’t USA. USA likes to always value companies based on domestic revenue potential alone"

"I suggest anyone with doubts about Biogen’s intrinsic value: read the latest earnings report transcript (Seeking Alpha). Especially pay attention to the Q&A, which frequently focuses on aducanumab approval and efficacy. Management is extremely optimistic that FDA approval is forthcoming. Well worth your time!"
"Thank you FDA for early approval sNDA for $OCUL , next is sNDA for $AMRN , buyout could come early too from $BIIB $GILD. $MRK and $J&J"
"The FDA probe is a huge positive, the FDA just wants the public to retain confidence so they are like “guys we did everything right and go ahead and let’s have it independently looked at”. . Also so much controversy regarding Biogen I think Lilly won’t want to file now until they complete there phase 3 trials due to the bad rep they might also endure. This is all a plus for Biogen."
"Not over yet. Suspect initiation of another trial and continuation of suspended trial will be advised/ and decision by FDA delayed. the 78‐week, phase III registration trials of ADU -- might have been too short to show anything of significance. Especially as those enrolled in the trials are already showing elevated Aβ by PET imaging (meaning damage already done). I would like to see patients at high risk for dementia but no damage on PET and no cognitive deficit receive this drug over a 5 year period. My guess is there would be a subset of people with dramatically decreased cognitive impairment. UP TO 50% of 80 year old show some sign of dementia****. When I looked at the initial study and MRI images of pt's on this drug I was blown away -- in 40 years as a physician I have never seen anything so amazing and hope we don't walk away from this yet."
"I would argue there are enough wealthy Americans who won’t partake of the insurance even if they are eligible to help those who need it more- 56k for 200,000 - that’s just 4000 per state roughly - would pay the whole 56k with joy!! If I was worth 5 million dollars and my mom or dad had early onset. I would forget Medicare and tell the docs I’ll pay for it entirely out of pocket- my parents being with me for another 10 years with sufficient cognition is worth it!That’s already 10 billion for biogen. We really are looking at 3-4x revenue from current levels- So then for a company that religiously buys back shares. The share price should be triple from here !!!"
"Can anyone tell me of any time, ever, when the FDA did not follow the advice of an advisory board?￼"
"Biogen, Brining the world brain swelling and bleeding for the low low price of 56K per year. Sign up early for a free sample."
Heading back to 100 as FDA is investigating why it approved drug for Alzheimers. Glad i'm still short from 420.

"Biogen and Eisai win FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy tag for Alzheimer’s drug lecanemabJun. 23, 2021 4:27 PM ETBIIB, ESALF...By: Dulan Lokuwithana, SA News Editor2 Comments￼Bet_Noire/iStock via Getty ImagesBiogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Eisai (OTCPK:ESALF), (OTCPK:ESALY) announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for lecanemab (BAN2401), an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Breakthrough Therapy designation aimed to accelerate the research work and review of treatments targeting serious or life-threatening conditions enables the developer to receive intensive guidance from the FDA with potential eligibility for priority review.Lecanemab targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) is undergoing a Phase 3 clinical study, AHEAD 3-45, in individuals with preclinical AD.In March, the two companies completed the enrollment for the Clarity AD study involving patients with early AD.The regulator’s decision on lecanemab was based on recently published results of a Phase 2b clinical trial (Study 201) which involved 856 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD.Now read: Biogen, Eisai respond to questions surrounding approval of Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm2 CommentsShareCommentComments (2)Newest￼Publish￼mrsh1Today, 5:06 PMComments (1.44K)Biogen Idec is far from being a one-trick pony company!

"Every possible FDA decision, corporate decision or life decision could have been “handled” differently. What is the opposite of that - that it was handled with perfection. She hasn’t admitted to anything And more we she has backed her decision even at this stage. She’s basically saying check me throughly I’m not the thief u smart people think I am. I’m open to being throughly checked!! This will end soon!"

"Sifting through the time and sales, it looks like the institutions have been buying big amounts at the end of the last several days, so the smart money still thinks this is going to go up.

BIIB and LLY will likely take big hits on July 29th if SAVA's 9 month cognitive and safety results are consistent with 6 month data......BIIB and LLY both have high rates of painful brain swelling which gives SAVA a huge opening.
sell this now.. this is an nightmare for investors.. drug could get pulled. Get out over $300
"I have been an investor for many years. Biogen is a solid company with many drugs that they are very profitable from, not even including Aducabulem...I see the last few days that the stock has been trading in a wild fashion. The volume has diminished, so less people are going to be trading. From here I believe that many institutions will be acquiring the stock for long term. With Aducalem, approved, Biogen is in the forefront to lead the Alzheimer’s disease. I don’t see any difficulty for them getting the price they’re asking. There are 8 million people with Alzheimer’s in just USA alone, not including the other countries. Even if they lowered the price a smidgin, they will do revenue in the billions with just this drug, plus the other drugs can’t forget. So whether you buy the stock or not, If you do choose to buy, I can honestly say that you will do well in the long run. Very well run company. I betting that they buy out either Ions Pharmaceuticals or Sarepta. Let’s keep this board, with well educated thoughts and opinions. P.S. boycott the NBA, NFL, racist organizations.... “All lives matter”"
"Biogen recently submitted a paper to JAMA that analyzed results from the clinical trials of its new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. However, Biogen later withdrew the paper because JAMA considered rejecting it unless edits were made, according to two sources familiar with the matter."

"My mother was bed stricken for 5 years and died a horribly death from Alzheimer's disease at the age of 66. I'm 68 and over the last year or two my memory has noticeably deteriorated and a recent Pet scan shows I have amyloid plaque starting to build-up in my brain. I don't want to go out the same way my mother did and welcome the approval of Aduhelm which after consulting with my doctor hope to be treated with in the coming months. I pray they can get the cost down to $25k/yr or less, but at least it gives people like me some measure of hope even if the level of efficacy it provides is still not fully known."
"Told ya.... This was totally expected considering all the events post approval, including resignations......This is going back to 200s and possibly 100s.... It held up 200s only due to this drug hopes... Now, there is investigation both on approval and pricing.....Big boys will sell in bulk....."
Late stage cancer patients take marginally effective drugs with extreme side affects everyday and pay big money for them. Never seen people on this board decry they immorality of late stage cancer drugs. Aduhelm is appoved and Medicare customers have the right to get Aduhelm paid for by the US Government.
"$303! This is ridiculous. Adu is the only drug approved to treat mild AD. It is effective and safety profile is acceptable. Adu will bring in $5 B annually (peak $10 B) for BIIB. In fact I bought more at $300! After the dust settles, Adu will sell well and some AD patients will benefit from it, MEANINGFULLY!"
"I am not sure if some analysts really understand the phase 3 analysis by Biogen, which shows adu is efficacious at higher dose.I just bought biogen shares this morning b/c I concluded the chances of Adu approval is much higher than 50% (in my opinion, over 75%) after analyzing Biogen's presentations over the weekend."
BIIB will save the Alzheimer community and the world! Yaaahooooo!
