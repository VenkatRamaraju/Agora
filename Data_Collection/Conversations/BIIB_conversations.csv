Sold all shares and now short BIIB. Adu might be rejected.......
"ELEPHANT in the room is the EU approval, thats 1.5 billion pop. That’ll have atleast 5-7 million on Aduhelm and the like. The revenue ramp up is tooo insane to ignore. We are just up 30 percent or 2 p/es since approval. These are still very early days!Biogen buys back shares arm over fist. The money they will make could send their EPS north of 70.Again easily a 1000 stock"
"Guys do we actually think this is going to go lower now??My chart tells me that 345 is the floor, we have tested it soo many times and it looks unlikely we'll break it. Support at 345 also comes from uptrending support from 250, and also the classic bull flag from the sharp rise."
"This stock is a gem at these prices.If you have done your due deligence.. Whatever the share price now is meaningless..Take a look at $Biib..Inspite of how controversial it's drug was,it got FDA approval..Sens product isn't new,it's just an update on it..It's already approved in the EU and it's in use..So approval is not if..It's only when..."
Positive biib analyst coming up on CNBC. Let's see if it'll move the needle
"Bad news for AD patients but they can go to different clinics. Your life, your choice"
started peak on June 10 and continue to drop for three weeks. it is time to be stable and make U turn..
"Man I don't know why no one is buying Aduhelm? I mean you get dangerous brain swelling with no cognitive benefit all for the low low price of $56,000 per year. I guess people are just to stubborn to see that paying for brain swelling is a good thing."
Brain bleeding drug design is why people mistrust your company and others along with the fda.
"Biogen, Brining the world brain swelling and bleeding for the low low price of 56K per year. Sign up early for a free sample."
Now closer to the low of the year than the high... :-(
"The FDA probe is a huge positive, the FDA just wants the public to retain confidence so they are like “guys we did everything right and go ahead and let’s have it independently looked at”. . Also so much controversy regarding Biogen I think Lilly won’t want to file now until they complete there phase 3 trials due to the bad rep they might also endure. This is all a plus for Biogen."
still keep tracking AD sale. and patient feedback. keep finger cross
"The stock market for SAVA looks insane. The clinical trial they performed was totally unblinded, i.e., the data would be easy to be manipulated. However, so many investors rush to buy the stocks from them and totally neglect the results from the double blinded trials from Biogen which has tested more than 3000 patients. This is really ridiculous. Tomorrow we will see how SAVA stock price plummets (Warning: I am guessing so you don't need to follow my words .What ever results from SAVA are, they are both positive to the stock price of Biogen in the long run. Let us see."
"Thanks for another successful transaction of $25, 000. I'm so glad trading in your platform FacebookStephanie A William"
"$303! This is ridiculous. Adu is the only drug approved to treat mild AD. It is effective and safety profile is acceptable. Adu will bring in $5 B annually (peak $10 B) for BIIB. In fact I bought more at $300! After the dust settles, Adu will sell well and some AD patients will benefit from it, MEANINGFULLY!"
BIIB Alzheimer’s. Where are the scientific/medical supporters of approval ? I have read none except wallstreet.
Looks like BIIB paid off the FDA. Why would their stock sink so fast with the new about AD. How low will it go?
"can’t believe you all are getting bullish here… enjoy holding that bag once the hearings start. This company, and the FDA are under investigation. A child can tell you the data shows no changes. The launch is ruined anyway, and patients won’t be able to afford it."
Buy SAVA and thank me later ;)
"Does anyone have thoughts on the Phase 1 trial that Biogen started recently for subcutaneous delivery of Aduhelm? Looking for reasonable, interpretive insight into the company’s plan/strategy. Thanks in advance."
I bought Biogen right before the good news and then I got out around 400 and did well - The question is what do I do know? Any advice
There’s 6 people left posting on this board. They’re the only 6 people that haven’t covered yet. The ironic part is they post about morality as they’re trying to deceive people.
The FDA did a right thing for AZD patients. I am convinced that ADU will be shown to be efficacious in phase 4. The FDA was right about Sarepta's drug. Many are jealous about BIIB's making money with the first AZ drug.
Aduhelm is dead in the water. Just face it. Been in health care most of my life
Sls just started hiring for manufacturing on Sellas life science website last week signaling they know pending fda approval is coming soon. Sellas showed their hand and it’s obviously amazing just like phase 1 and 2 were. 20-40x on approval and up from there.
If a drug has severe side effects why would the developer give it for free. Because people have been scared of this drug .. once a few hundred people start and no major issues the news will spread
Why did this stock run up recently? I forgot already. Please remind me to put a buy order when it's below $250 so that I can profit again from the next hype cycle.
Congress members who ask for information of who what when why did the FDA did what it did sounds like a joke!! It?s the #$%$ FDA for hells sake!! For every scientific opinion against Aduhelm there are scientists with reasons for!! Congress members themselves will be on this eventually. The FDA has never been under mined before and it won?t again. In this case we must retrial every aspect of Supreme Court decisions as well. What a circus act this has alll become
"The SEC should launch an investigation: news today Jul-09 leaked 6 minutes before publication. Stock began decline 12:53, news 12:59."
SAVA in phase 3 will take years. As it doesn’t eliminate a bio marker like amyloid. It’ll have to prove to the FDA that it has clinical benefits. This won’t hit the market for 2-3 years.
"$BIIB I'm adding with both hands    This is like free money hereInvestors, however, are overlooking Biogen’s portfolio of drugs for multiple sclerosis, skin aliments, and rheumatoid arthritis"
SAVA! !! !!!
The committee had found that the evidence did not convincingly show that Aduhelm could slow cognitive decline in people in the early stages of the disease — and that the drug could cause potentially serious side effects of brain swelling and brain bleeding. None of the 11 members of the committee considered the drug ready for approval: Ten voted against and one was uncertain.
"by law, medicaid and medicare must cover fda accelerated approval drugs. private payers like BC/BS usually cover but with some limits. 90% of AA pts fall into Medicare/MS. expect 100,000 to 200,000 to get it in m/m."
I have early AZ diagnosis. think I'll wait 6 months or a year until maybe the LLY drug is out. Nobody said ever.
Team $SAVA a real drug for AZ that doesn’t put the community at such a risk!
BIIB and LLY will likely take big hits on July 29th if SAVA's 9 month cognitive and safety results are consistent with 6 month data......BIIB and LLY both have high rates of painful brain swelling which gives SAVA a huge opening.
"So much for all those 400 and 450 price targets last month...Perfect example of why analysts don't know any more than you do. They're just overpaid researchers doing the same thing that any joe shmo on the street can can, and getting the same info thats available anywhere on the web."
"Told ya.... This was totally expected considering all the events post approval, including resignations......This is going back to 200s and possibly 100s.... It held up 200s only due to this drug hopes... Now, there is investigation both on approval and pricing.....Big boys will sell in bulk....."
"Alzforum published a summary of the BIIB080 Phase 1b results Friday, with several encouraging quotes from neuroscientists."
"Like I said, nothing to see here. Sorry shorts, will be back over $400 in not time. Analysts following Biogen stock see little reason for concern over the request made by the acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an investigation into the agency's approval of the company's Alzheimer's therapy.The request was an acknowledgment of the widespread concerns raised by the nod the agency gave the drug in early June. Biogen shares dropped 3% on Friday, but the view on Wall Street is that the investigation won't have a long-term impact on the stock.""We believe that no matter what the outcome of the investigation, we think it is unlikely to influence the uptake of the drug,"" Truist analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a note out Friday.In a separate note, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote that the request for an investigation ""is another controversy to deal with,"" but said he expects any investigation to determine that the FDA had the authority to give the approval it gave, ""allowing markets to move on from this chapter."""
Green in a sea of red today!
Lot more downside.
Sls 20x on cancer drug to treat 20 types of cancer. Yesterday company started hiring for manufacturing on Sellas life sciences website signaling they know fda approval coming. This will be the stock of this century . 20 types of cancer that there are no good treatments for. All trials have been amazing.
"Timber!! Expert medical panel, recently said AD drug offers no improvement over std care."
I see it down to $200 now. No need to waste money.

Here’s the BEAR FLAG breaking down. This will close below $345. Mark this post.
INMB - Thank me later but do some research on this one.
"WSJ, Friday August 6 : “Could the COVID Vaccine (and Others) Prevent Alzheimer’s?” . Very interesting article which discusses studies that indicate lifetime vaccinations lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s (by up to 60%). Worth a read! …still much more to learn about AD control and prevention."
This company is selling an inferior product with horrible side effects at an astronomical cost; of course it will tank.
"So many people are doubting the the effectiveness of the Biogen alzheimer drug because they only focused failure of one of the two clinical trials. They never asked why the trial failed. In fact, it was due to the inappropriate dose of experimental drug when the trial was initiated. The subgroup in the trial that followed correct dose showed the similar positive results from the other trial. Right now many politicians, doctors, and some organizations step out claiming the drug should not be approved because the drug is useless. I wonder how they made such a conclusion. In the future trial, if the results can show that the drug can really slow down the progression of the disease for some patients, these guys would feel ashamed about what they did today."
"Lilly hits 200b market value and still in green, but Biogen only 55B, but in red. what is going here stock market? load up BIIB."
"Why by aduhelm for $56,000 a year when you can by a bat and smack yourself in the head a bunch of times and receive the same benefit. Brain swelling and bleeding and it will probably only cost you $20"
The fact that there is no longer a lot of commentary here is a good sign the selling has diminished. I think we’re marching a lot higher from here
"Shorts, this kind of news has been baked into the price since ages ago, giving an explanation to the fallA review was inevitable, the price being revised downwards till around 36K is also inevitable and has been priced in (hence the 30% or so drop from peak, which represents a huge loss in mcap)Gov can not seriously question FDA that much as it is the FDA's decision, NOT the governments. FDA will also stress the fact that approval was given under it's accelerated pathway scheme which further cements the idea that efficiacy is not required as in depth as with a conventional approval.Main problem here will be the gov looking to revise price downwards due to low efficiacy, this will lead to gov, FDA and biogen dispute about the accelerated pathway not requiring absolute efficiacy proof, and even in worst case scenario, if price is revised down, won't impact sp even that much as a revision is expected."
$900 stock only if 0.5M patients are treated on ADU @$20K /year!
"So, how much should be charge for our Alzheimer drug ?????"
Predictions of any news released on Monday?
could biogen go to 600 if aduhelm works
"WSJ today:""Despite Pressure, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s Drug Still a Likely BlockbusterWorries over Aduhelm’s price and reimbursement have sparked a selloff in Biogen—and given investors a fresh opportunity..."""
"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is widely believed to be driven by the production and deposition of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ). This has been addressed in any textbooks in Biochemistry and is also taught by the professors in any medical schools in the world. Right now all the drugs including the ""seemingly effective"" Silmufilm from SAVA , which the company can only show its effectiveness using ""open label"" trials to boost its stock price (Weird to me!), has to be tested to prove its effectiveness by measuring the size of the plaques. Therefore, anyone who claimed that the Biogen's drug is invalid is totally ignorant about the science behind the horrible disease. Of course, whether the building up of the plaques is the only factor or one of the multiple factors that causes the memory loss in the disease is another issue, which needs to be further explored in the future clinical trials. Currently, no scientist can stand out to answer the question."
down to $300. karma for rushing a fake drug
"the drug reduces/eliminates plaques and plaques are the defining feature of AZ, indeed it is how it is diagnosed. so if you remove the plaques then by current definition you would no longer have AZ. the definition is likely flawed and the decline can only be slowed but that is the state of the art. so many cry babies act like there is no good science here but quite the other way around. many programs are following BIIB's lead."
"""The accelerated approval was based on very solid grounds,"" Woodcock said during Stat's Breakthrough Science Summit. However, she said, ""It is possible the process could have been handled in a way that would have decreased the amount of controversy involved."" (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell in New York and Trisha Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)Translation, nothing is going to come of the investigation."
Adios my beloved BIIB! Remember when screwing your employees? Letting them go just a few weeks before their stocks vested?
Everyone expected this drug would not be approved.It has been. It's been a company saver.Why do people suddenly think its going down to old price of 280?? It can't be taken off the market until at least the confirmatory trials are undergone in a few years time.
Anytime the government gets involved it spells trouble for the industry

A billion in sales of Aduhelm next quarter and many feedback from patients will tell how effective Aduhelm will be? I believe early and mildly symptoms benefit the most. Still worth the money especially after discount and insurance negotiations will dropped significantly and probably around $40 grand
drug should never have gotten approval.. GL with federal investigation

"The streak of bad luck continues for aducanumab (Aduhelm), as the VA decided not to add the new Alzheimer's drug to its formulary and even recommended against offering it. (Endpoints News)"
Geez. What a surprise. The Socialists in the House want to control everything including the efficacy and price of a drug that shows promise against a deadly disease. Beauracracy at its best.
"In a note Monday, Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond brushed aside the worrying signals. Citing a survey of 74 neurologists, Raymond wrote that many still plan to prescribe the drug.""While docs continue to have misgivings around Aduhelm's clinical profile, intent to prescribe remains robust enough to meet or beat consensus in the near to intermediate-term,"" said Raymond, who has been critical of the FDA's decision to approve the drug.Raymond has a Buy rating on Biogen, and a $450 target price. The stock closed at $324.62 on Friday, and was down 0.8% in premarket trading on Monday. Shares closed as high as $414.71 in early June, days after the FDA approved Aduhelm, but the stock has slid in recent weeks. Still, shares are up 32.6% so far this year."
Price target is still over $400; good time to buy
"a big drop today, but also opportunity to buy"
I got pura a week ago for.0106. For every share you buy you will get a share of poag and nouv. It’s only at .0145 right now. Karma
"BIIB BEATS EXPECTATIONS MORE THAN A DOLLAR IN EARNINGS REPORT. That’s amazing, how many companies can top 25%?"
"Once evidence comes forth that it works predominantly in early onset AZ only, everyone with plaques with or without AZ will won’t to get on board and that point I would assume the price would fall to 20k where a few million people can then take it. Again I can’t believe Biogen isn’t going to have revenues of 7 billion- 15 billion with this drug. Even with competition. The world isn’t USA. USA likes to always value companies based on domestic revenue potential alone"
I heard about BIIB the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
What is the latest with the FDA approval?
FDA POWER STRUGGLES?
"Biogen recently submitted a paper to JAMA that analyzed results from the clinical trials of its new Alzheimer's drug, Aduhelm. However, Biogen later withdrew the paper because JAMA considered rejecting it unless edits were made, according to two sources familiar with the matter."
https://discord.gg/e3aknp5
Have the EU approved the drug?
"Despite all the controversy concerning its Alzheimer's drug, its the only company with an FDA approval.When it was approved, the stock went over 468. Will be buying every pullback."
"Biogen drug removes plaque, a best marker for Alzheimer disease at least now, with some effect on slowing down on memory deterioration. If I I’m in early dementia and have that amount of money to spare, I will certainly take it. If Medicare pays some, even better. Without trying, the memory goes down quickly. I invest in biib, sava, avxl, anvi, because I may need down the road. Support them now and reap the benefits later."
"Nobody is going to pay $65,000 for the snake oil Alzheimer drug period."
"Extremely risky......A lot of doubts existed, but getting stronger by the day....New investigatiion by FDA.....Potentially detrimental to BIIB....and possibly more bio stocks.....Be cautious...."
SAVA in the drivers seat.
Anyone knows what is happening? Biogen at the Morgan Stanley 19th Annual Global Healthcare Conference@9:30 am
ADUHELM + PREVAGEN = Improved memory. $$$$$$$$#$#$#
Let’s not hate biogen or the drug companies for such big prices. It’s incentive for them to bring cures that are badly needed. They atleast got something to market! Lilly data shows more conclusively that riding plaques can have a substantial difference to disease progression!
"This won't have massive implications. The investigation is only seeking clarity and no doubt biogen will give that stated clarity, along with the FDAThis is only to calm down anyone anxious and to deal with the pricing situation. A drop in pricing outright imo is unlikely, only more exceptions for lower pricing which is priced into stock already"
"What is likely Biogen's biggest near-term threat ?SAVA reporting robust 9 month Simufilam cognition, behavior and safety data on Thursday, July 29th, at the AAIC.Hedge thy self.........Buying SAVA IMO would be a perfect hedge for BIIB and LLY shareholders.Good luck to all :)"
"a mere 20,000 treatments = 1 billion dollars for BIIB"
"Big downgrade. The shorts will be all over this. lol Morgan Stanley Adjusts Price Target on Biogen to $453 From $455, Maintains Overweight Rating"
"Kevin; your point is misguided. It's true that these drugs will reduce amyloid build up but that's if you start taking them in your 30""s or 40's; that's the science. The FDA approval was wrong and initially gave false hope to those who have nothing else to look forward to other than no quality of life. With the re- labeling and the visceral criticism from many medical and scientific experts about the Aduhelm approval, let's hope that the next iteration of similar treatments will be much more effective, lower priced and worthy of approval by the politicized FDA. That's why I shorted Biogen big time 3 weeks ago."
"let give it for free, and it will show the efficiency. no bad strategy."
BIIB will save the Alzheimer community and the world! Yaaahooooo!
"The bottom line:1) FDA approved the drug2) It is the only drug for AD3) It is expensive4) Insurance does not want to pay. Insurance has no problem being paid. On this board most people are associating their opinion with the way they invested their money. Bashers and pumpers are equally ignorant and opportunist. Side effects exist with every drug. No drug is 100% efficient. Doctors have different opinions and fear being sued. When Europe approves the drug, the price will shoot up 30% to 50%. If they dont approve then it is already factored in. I stand long and I am aware I could lose 15% to 30%"

Time to switch over to SAVA
Nothing worse than well off 30-40 year olds getting a lifetime prescription of Aduhelm (covered by insurance) to prevent cognitive decline. That will surely put Biogen out of business.
This is a big win today for the amyloid hypothesis stocks. Especially with the FDA advisory prima-donnas questioning efficacy. This is a win for both Biogen & Lilly.
Aduhelm's limited Mild AD label and high rates of painful brain swelling (*40%) in clinical trials gives SAVA's Simufilam a huge advantage in the global AD market upon approval. The Stock Market is speaking...Are you listening to its message ?
Do hospitals have a the authority not to carry certain medications. Isn’t that gong against patients and the FDA. Can’t they be sued by patients?

Management is expected to discuss the commercialization plans for Aduhelm on the second-quarter conference call and maybe mention the initial sales number.
"A series of biochemical experiments revealed a change to a common enzyme called glycogen synthase β (GSK3β). In the presence of healthy levels of hydrogen sulphide, GSK3β typically acts as a signalling molecule, adding chemical markers to other proteins and altering their function. However, the researchers observed that in the absence of hydrogen sulphide, GSK3β is over-attracted to another protein in the brain called Tau."
this stock should b 200 .. and not get that approval.. buy SAVA AVXL .. period
Any thoughts on share price Monday?
Could Biogen plummet to around $200 or so if Congress and the FDA decide to pull Aduhelm from the market ? Time will tell.
"Every possible FDA decision, corporate decision or life decision could have been “handled” differently. What is the opposite of that - that it was handled with perfection. She hasn’t admitted to anything And more we she has backed her decision even at this stage. She’s basically saying check me throughly I’m not the thief u smart people think I am. I’m open to being throughly checked!! This will end soon!"
Once a drug is approved by FDA it can not be taken back!!
"I would argue there are enough wealthy Americans who won’t partake of the insurance even if they are eligible to help those who need it more- 56k for 200,000 - that’s just 4000 per state roughly - would pay the whole 56k with joy!! If I was worth 5 million dollars and my mom or dad had early onset. I would forget Medicare and tell the docs I’ll pay for it entirely out of pocket- my parents being with me for another 10 years with sufficient cognition is worth it!That’s already 10 billion for biogen. We really are looking at 3-4x revenue from current levels- So then for a company that religiously buys back shares. The share price should be triple from here !!!"
"Rumored that J&J is buying SAVA, BIIB should outbid them and buy it before J&J does...."
It's obvious now and the reason this drug was approved. It gives a person a chance when there was none before.
"""I think if one looks at all the data, it’s quite clear that if you can remove [beta-amyloid] plaque rapidly then there will be a benefit,"" Abbvie President and Vice Chairman Michael Severino said during this morning's earnings call."""
shorts will short anything...they are omnivorous...Biogen gets no free pass...
"The best outcome here is that Biogen catalyzes competition to create real, functional therapeutics and prevention drugs to treat this horrible, dehumanizing disease. In the meantime BIIB is a short and the best way to play it is to sell ST ratio short call spreads to collect premium...and if it goes up $5-7, sell the long call for more than you paid for it at expiration and let the short OTM call expire. In other words, the risk and trend is to the downside."
BIIB080 data at AAIC next week. It will be interesting to see if any cognition measurements are included.
just buy it
will earnings be a miss???will they revise future earnings since the drug is a bust? will this head back to 250 range or lower??is a 20% drop or more out of the question at earnings?? will earnings from other revenues be lower?? asking for a friend 
"I’d the anti amyloid theory shows promise after a few years, u can absolutely bet on it Biogen will develop a pill version u take once or twice a day at home without hospital visits! If this can be achieved we have basically reduced Alzheimer’s into a chronic condition much like diabetes and HIV.The FDA was enormously compassionate with the approval as they are allowing people to try try . What is there to lose, nothing but billions of dollars. So what. People over Money isn’t that what we want government to show !!And everyone has their panties in a knot!"
We need to worry more about competition . Aduhelm has Donanemab and Roches new therapy .. but the biggest threat is Lecanemab because it’s an at home infusion - And guess who owns 50% of the profits of that company- BIOGEN!!!!
Biogen tumbles as FDA chief calls for a probe on Alzheimer’s drug approval
imagine buying biogen lmao
"With Aduhelm, history can repeat itself by following cancer’s successBy Andrew C. von Eschenbach July 29, 2021The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Biogen’s Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm has stirred intense controversy, with pundits launching attacks on multiple fronts. Professors focus on population outcomes rather than individual treatment responses; politicians worry about drug pricing rather than disease cost; critics pounce on the FDA’s narrowing of the drug’s label to reflect its clinical trial — all casting doubt on the drug’s effectiveness and value.What’s been lost in the flurry is an understanding of how progress against complex diseases advances — and the historic importance of Aduhelm as a first step in that process.Alzheimer’s robs people of memory, cognition, and the dignity of being human. It is a public health crisis that will eventually bankrupt every health care system challenged with financing institutionalized care for the coming wave of dementia patients. There is no cure and no standard therapy. The wasteland of research failures causes many investigators to shy from committing careers to Alzheimer’s, while the biopharmaceutical industry avoids the risk of futile investments of billions of dollars.This year, for the first time since Alzheimer’s was first described in 1906, the FDA granted what’s called accelerated approval for a drug with substantial evidence of affecting the underlying disease mechanism, though its effects on symptoms remains to be elucidated.Fifty years ago, when the National Cancer Act was passed, cancer posed much the same threat as Alzheimer’s disease poses today: no cure, only rudimentary understanding of the disease, and an enormous emotional and financial toll on families and society. Yet many forms of cancer are now amenable to cures or long periods of remission and control.This progress did not take place in one giant leap.In the earliest days of cancer chemotherapy, a modest response rate of 20% to 30% was celebrated as a victory, especially compared to zero. Those responses mattered because they exposed tumors’ vulnerabilities and offered hope for those who responded to treatment and their loved ones.As a cancer physician and former director of the National Cancer Institute, I believe the burden should be on critics to explain why we should not view biological responses to Aduhelm in people with Alzheimer’s the same way and follow the same road map to greater success.Early, tentative responses to new therapies mobilized the cancer community to a sustained effort at building on incremental progress. With patience, persistence, and the heroic participation of cancer patients who braved potential side effects, researchers and clinicians made astounding gains.In my own experience as a urologic oncologist, the results in widespread metastatic testicular cancer have been stunning. Once a virtual death sentence with no curative treatments, patients now experience an almost 100% survival rate utilizing a combination of chemotherapy agents.This history of progress in the fight against cancer shows that the FDA was right to approve Aduhelm — not as a silver bullet but as a first, essential step in climbing a mountain to success for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families.Researchers will eventually discern whether amyloid plaque is a cause of Alzheimer’s disease or an effect of it. But reduction of plaque is an essential observation — just as in a cancer trial where survival is the meaningful endpoint but tumor response is the critical observation because it shows researchers they are on a path that matters.The FDA has launched this journey for Alzheimer’s with the accelerated approval of Aduhelm. In fact, the agency has already taken the next step by granting Eli Lilly’s Alzheimer’s treatment, donanemab, breakthrough designation, which is intended for serious or life-threatening conditions in which preliminary clinical evidence supports a potential significant improvement over existing therapies.Aduhelm is not a silver bullet in the battle against Alzheimer’s, and the hand-wringing critics are wrong to hold it to that standard. The more productive route is to recognize the drug as a first treatment that can galvanize the scientific/medical community, industry, and patient advocates to begin the hard, step-by-step process that leads to better treatments and hopefully, one day, a cure. That’s the future we all wish for Alzheimer’s and all neurodegenerative diseases. That’s the effort we owe to desperate patients living in fear they will not recognize or remember the names of their loved ones.Andrew C. von Eschenbach is an oncologist, president of Samaritan Health Initiatives, former director of the National Cancer Institute, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and a member of the board of Wren Therapeutics.

BIIB's and LLY's very high rates of painful brain swelling in clinical trials gives SAVA a huge opening July 29th when they release 9 month cognitive and safety data......Hedge thy self
"fast tract designation of EILY LILLY RX for ALZEIMER doesn't mean FDA, approval of this RX,"
Heading back to 100 as FDA is investigating why it approved drug for Alzheimers. Glad i'm still short from 420.
"Biogen and Eisai win FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy tag for Alzheimer’s drug lecanemabJun. 23, 2021 4:27 PM ETBIIB, ESALF...By: Dulan Lokuwithana, SA News Editor2 Comments￼Bet_Noire/iStock via Getty ImagesBiogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Eisai (OTCPK:ESALF), (OTCPK:ESALY) announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for lecanemab (BAN2401), an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Breakthrough Therapy designation aimed to accelerate the research work and review of treatments targeting serious or life-threatening conditions enables the developer to receive intensive guidance from the FDA with potential eligibility for priority review.Lecanemab targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) is undergoing a Phase 3 clinical study, AHEAD 3-45, in individuals with preclinical AD.In March, the two companies completed the enrollment for the Clarity AD study involving patients with early AD.The regulator’s decision on lecanemab was based on recently published results of a Phase 2b clinical trial (Study 201) which involved 856 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD.Now read: Biogen, Eisai respond to questions surrounding approval of Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm2 CommentsShareCommentComments (2)Newest￼Publish￼mrsh1Today, 5:06 PMComments (1.44K)Biogen Idec is far from being a one-trick pony company!

why ~5% drop today?
Biib’s anti-Tau will complement its Aduhelm to treat AD. BIIB is a leading company in treating Neurology disease. They will prevail
I was dead on with the short I put on at $440back to 2 Handel soon.
Let’s just wait for the EU approval to roll in. The Europeans are not going to be happy to be denied what their American counterparts can access!! That’s 2.5 billion people. Can we atleast agree 1.5 million ultimate users worldwide only 200k in America. That’s already 100billion. What is this market missing!
Time to short more !!
Why do we even have a FDA if they are constantly going to be challenged or discredited. More and more of this is evolving!
"Ionis shareholder here. Hey Biogen, where’s our tofersen data?"
"Serious question, should Biogen try and buyout SAVA ?. Like buying out Tysabri from ELN back in the day to corner the market. Also hedging their bet with a secondary treatment therapy."
$BIIB Ye just gave a $500 price target on @cnbc minutes ago!
"BIIB's sell off should be expected and should continue given that Aduhelm FAILED.... to improve cognition in their P3 trials; an alarming 40% of patients experienced painful brain swelling, and the cost of treatment is extremely expensive. For example, Dr Constantine Lyketsos, the director of the Memory and Alzheimer's Treatment Center at Johns Hopkins said that Aduhelm treatment costs are about ""$100,000"" a year, per patient due to safety monitoring and MRIs. Add it all up, it's not surprising that most global HC Payers are not giving the green light to Aduhelm...Again, BIIB's Aduhelm launch problems were caused by the FDA, for approving a treatment that was overwhelmingly rejected by the expert ADCOM panel."
Meanwhile SAVA is up 28% today. Go figure!
drugs companies save and improve life.but always there is big eyes on them by the media and politicians screaming why they charge high on drugs.they silent on tech companies and there must by pressure they make exaggerate profits and they stocks value become trillions.and they committed tricks to eliminate competition.on them must be pressure
Irrespective of SAVA’s simufilam- which isn’t an amyloid antagonist- and also not a silver bullet. The AZ community needs drugs like Aduhelm to clear the plaques. Just like in cancer u need to rid the tumor . U don’t argue whether the tumor was caused by this or that. U remove the tumors first. In order for this amyloid theory to really give solid answers patients on the 1000s need to get on these drugs. Means billions for these companies. I can’t understand how the market is missing this crucial point.
Shorts will be on  soon. This is not a startup company that may have nothing on the market!

too expensive and too much room for a drop. their other medications aren't doing so hot either.I hope it turns around. I'm heavily loaded in SAVA. GL all!
I think what people are not realizing is the Aduhelm and Donanemab are not intended for the AZ community of 6 million. But for the ageing population 55 plus who have plaque but no signs of cognitive decline just yet. That market is 50 million strong. Think of it like Prep for HIV! Or Rogaine for people who have not yet lost hair. It’s a preventative approach that works not curative. That’s a far bigger market worldwide than a cure for AZ!!When will the market realize that???? When the trials further elucidate the effectiveness as a prophylactic treatment !This will then see 100 billion sales world wide. 2025-2027 Biogen will be a 150 billion company
Late stage cancer patients take marginally effective drugs with extreme side affects everyday and pay big money for them. Never seen people on this board decry they immorality of late stage cancer drugs. Aduhelm is appoved and Medicare customers have the right to get Aduhelm paid for by the US Government.
"As you know, the Alzheimer’s Association has advocated strongly for approval of aducanumab, now called Aduhelm, which received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 7. This treatment, while not a cure, has the potential to give more time to those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s or those with early stage Alzheimer’s dementia. Thanks to your strong support of our work in so many ways, this is the first treatment ever to achieve such approval to address Alzheimer’s disease itself, not just the symptoms. Since I last communicated with you about the approval, much has happened. The FDA has now clarified the people who would likely benefit from this new treatment. It is the same group I described above and the group that the Alzheimer’s Association has advocated to have access to this treatment throughout the approval process. Achieving access to treatment for those who would likely benefit is now our focus. Regrettably, Biogen, the company that developed Aduhelm, priced it at $56,000 annually. That is simply unacceptable. The Alzheimer’s Association continues to call on the company to change that price. To fail to do so would deny access for many who could benefit. To achieve access for this treatment, and other treatments that will one day follow, the Alzheimer’s Association is committed to working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as health insurance companies and others in the private payer community, to expedite coverage and access. You might have also heard that there have been multiple calls for investigation of the approval process for Aduhelm. The Alzheimer’s Association strongly supports such inquiries to reassure all of us that treatment approval processes work the way they should. We firmly believe that the FDA’s accelerated approval was the right decision, given the publicly available science, especially for such a devastating and fatal disease — one that otherwise has no treatment to even slow it down. Having the availability of such an option and access to it are needs we’ve long heard from the patient and caregiver community that we serve. You can be assured that the Alzheimer’s Association will continue to advocate for coverage of this now approved treatment for everyone who is likely to benefit. Thank you so much for all of your support to make it possible to improve the lives of so many others! Sincerely,Harry Johns SignatureHarry JohnsChief Executive Officer"
"My mother was bed stricken for 5 years and died a horribly death from Alzheimer's disease at the age of 66. I'm 68 and over the last year or two my memory has noticeably deteriorated and a recent Pet scan shows I have amyloid plaque starting to build-up in my brain. I don't want to go out the same way my mother did and welcome the approval of Aduhelm which after consulting with my doctor hope to be treated with in the coming months. I pray they can get the cost down to $25k/yr or less, but at least it gives people like me some measure of hope even if the level of efficacy it provides is still not fully known."
This is about to drop really hard. 100% closing Below $350

"AD drug gets revenue, also collects feedbacks from patients. it is only hope for AD patients now. buy at this low price."
SAVA is 50% off guys!
"No way the earnings call isn't filled with Hopium and good guidance for Aduhelm.You've not listened to the previous calls if you think anything else. October $350 calls extra cheap, get 'em now."
Amazing how they manipulate price to stay under 300. Buy
"Again, irrational markets. A 2nd Biogen drug for AlZ gets a thumbs up from the FDA, and we sell off! Lily’s anti amyloid drug also got a nod from the FDA today, reiterating the efficacy of the data against amyloid! What the studies show is putting out the fire after the forest has burned doesn’t return it to its original splendor.Removing the fire as soon as it’s ignited can save the forest!Getting the plaques out as soon as the show up has been proven to slow the decline- to what extent- that’s why the approval was so needed so we can answer that- and that’s why it was a broad approval with no restrictions.This is 1000 dollar stock!"

"The Ship is taking on water, so it's time to head toward the life boats."
"If the US government and FDA decide to pull Aduhelm from the market, will BIIB then plummet and retest its 52-week low ? This has to be a major concern for longs going forward."
"I had to use my common sense and pharmalogical background here. SAVA is the Holy Grail for Alzheimer's Disease. I can predict Biogen's future, when the first court case begins for damaging the brain further. I just sold all my Biogen shares and tripled my SAVA shares! SAVA is the clear Winner here!"
"ps. The head of the,FDA is calling for an investigation into her own department to find out information. Imagine the head of safety at a company asking the CEO to investigate why safety broke down. He would be fired on the spot. And people wonder why the country is coming apart."
Complete overreaction !!!
"Medicare will likely go with this criteria for coverage (about 5% of the 6 M USA Alz pts): ""Doctors have shown strong interest in prescribing Aduhelm for about 35% of early-stage Alzheimer’s patients with mild cognitive impairment, Jefferies analysts found after surveying 50 U.S. neurologists or psychiatrists who currently treat about 12,000 Alzheimer’s patients.The rate suggests “good planned uptake” of the med compared with Wall Street’s expectations, the Jefferies team noted. If that enthusiasm pans out in the long run, it could mean at least 300,000 patients taking the drug, or $10 billion to $15 billion in peak Aduhelm from U.S. sales alone, which is above consensus estimates of around $7 billion to $8 billion, the team said.https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biogen-s-aduhelm-despite-controversy-could-see-10b-to-15b-u-s-sales-alzheimer-s-doctors"
The relabel is a big plus.. because as a broad label people with advanced stages might not see benefits and the drug would be trashedIf mild cases don’t progress they would remain on it. And every year there would be new patients on it. Basically there would be very few advanced cases that mean millions of people on anti amyloid drugs
"I hope its true that ""[t]he accelerated approval was based on very solid grounds,"" or else this stock is going to tank."
All credibility lost with biib- fda padding pockets
Patients want the drug! No one can’t stop it now! Money is meaningless if you become a walking dead.?
Sls just started hiring for manufacturing for cancer drug to treat 20 different types of cancer signaling to investors they know fda approval coming. 20-40x coming and they just announced surprise updates to occur 8/17
biib is out..they cant even give it away...VA threw it out...3 scientist on FDA panel resign in disgust after its unethical approval lacking efficacy and safety ...savas turn to shine
"Look out below, BIIB. SAVA is the new sheriff in town."
I think avg estimated eps is at $4.55. Not sure about revs. glta
thank you $biib for the dip
"Sorry, but they will suffer from thus rush….the drug isn’t ready. I like Biogen. Tecfidera has really been great for me, but they rushed this and it’s not effective."
"30% chance of brain swelling/bleeds, little efficacy, high cost ($56K/yr), expensive and painful administration IV. Office of the Inspector General investigating how this stuff was ever approved. 30% of the Advisory Board resigns and the remaining 70% voted ADU down. I sold my shares. Some of you must be paid pumpers or are smoking dope."
As expected..... this is the beginning of the end.....Be cautious.....
"They are probing the PRICE not the approval. Warren Buffett owns 643,00 shares, $224 MILLION worth as of close today. Nothing to see here. THE DRIG WORKS. Try harder shorts. ADDING"
LLY gained 16 billion in market cap today alone.BIIB has gained mere 10 billion in market cap since approval of AduhelmAmazing the logic with WS hates one but loves another
"I got out to be safe. This is so unfair to Biogen as two days before July 2nd they said they would negotiate on price. Now, without any facts the insinuation is there is nefarious dealings with the approval of this drug. It gives hope is the reason for approval when there was none before."
"FDA is calling for federal investigation into approval of their Alhzeimer drug, time to buy."
Should BIIB buy SAVA?
$BIIB out of 33 analysts CURRENT AVERAGE PRICE TARGET still $420! These bears trying to post fear are AMATEURS. Currently trading at the price target of most analysts BEFORE FDA approval. Friday will be green as cabbage. Someone bought $52 MILLION worth of shares on Wednesday at $374! They're gonna run this soon. Adding 750 shares tomorrow.
"Added 534 shares. Youre basically getting the stock without the Alzheimer's drug at this price, and the Alzheimer’s drug could become over 60% of its profits by the end of next year"
"People don't even want this dangerous drug for free...Doesn't that tell you something???? Get out while you can and buy the real winner, SAVA!"
"Looks like the haters are going to lose their bass on BIIB shorts. Remember Medicare has to pay for aduhelm, it’s the law."
Sls cancer drug GPS to treat 20 different types of cancer about to be approved as company just hiring for manufacturing this week signaling they know fda approval coming. Shorts trying to hide the news but analysts jumping on board recently and instituons buying. 30-50x on approval coming based on market pricing for cancer drugs. $148million to $4-$5billion and up for decades we on licensing deals and royalties. Shorts can’t keep this down going forward. Look at Sls and I bet u buy. Enjoy
"“ … But the Alzheimer’s Association’s focus on awareness — some would call it fear-based messaging — is consistent with what psychiatrist Susan Molchan says she sees from disease advocacy organizations that have financial ties to drug companies – and the Alzheimer’s Association currently lists six pharmaceutical companies among its national corporate sponsors. Although dated, a report on the Alzheimer’s Association website listed 31 pharmaceutical, insurance and diagnostic corporate donors in 2012. These companies collectively were responsible for some $4.2 million in revenue for the association in that year. And this group of sponsors donated some $20 million from 2008 through 2012, the report notes.” -health news review"
"I'm waiting for the class action lawsuits to begin. I'm curious what entities it will include. Biogen and FDA?Either way, that handshake deal has caused some investors to lose some serious money."
