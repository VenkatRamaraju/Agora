When do we find out about a declared dividend? Didn't HMY promise to pay 20% of its free cash flow to its shareholders?
"Okay, so Powell says that sooner rather than later the Fed will Taper and so accordingly interest rates are likely to go up, which will hurt Gold...I get it, BUT the market is flying once again. Can somebody tell me how Gold will ever again be a viable investment. It has basically done nothing since 2011, and now in a high inflation environment, it is doing nothing. What the heck does it take for Gold to go up a few hundred points?"
$3.00 next stop for hmy
"I have been following this closely and think we might actually repeat what we did June-July 2016 with a steep run-up to 4$ +. My original analysis indicated a 2$ price target however it seems that gld has held better than anticipated. With stocks this frothy a steep retrace in the coming month wouldn't be surprising together with a drop in the dollar. A combination of a stock correction, currency devaluation and a ~7-8% gld retrace could lead to the next leg up to the 1500-1600$ range. Gld seems poised to snap higher if it can break the downward channel, likewise a breakdown below would lead to a target of roughly 1360-1380 gld. Personally, it seems to me that we might break higher as GLD consolidates at the current level. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0SurZ4tE/"
Sorry for the recent spam - are we forming a giant bull flag? https://www.tradingview.com/x/wnCvRi9o/
Advancing POG will make HMY a great buy for months to come. Opinion: Buy and hold for now.
See you over $4. Junior miners way oversold. Higher bids on gold will result in a correction to the upside for this sector
"Where does hmy rank in the AscI department? Best i can tell, it is about twice the cost per ounce of the average miner. Now over 1500 per ounce. That's obviously a huge tail wind here."
"Feds will raise interest rates inflation too hot, gas $3.50 gal. and cpnsumer goods prices too high, gold will setback below $1700 very son then HMY $2.00 under! sell!!"
Short squeeze!!!
"US retail sales will be down huge for July, when announced next week. Gold will be back above $1800 by Wednesday"
"TODAY: FROM THE MARKET REALIST ------>Harmony Gold (HMY) is trading at the lowest multiple among its peers at 2.6x. The company bought a mine from AngloGold in 2018 and funded the acquisition through shares. This equity issuance was the major reason for the stock’s underperformance in 2018. While it remains a higher-cost producer, its management is expecting the South African rand’s weakness to support its costs going forward. Higher gold prices and a weaker rand could also provide support for the company’s valuation."
"A lot of people wondering why this stock (and other gold miners) has been selling off over the last few days.Technical investors flagged gold miners as being overbought based on the charts and there was a very high chance of a downward correction. That said, it did not predict the extent of the correction. The article also pointed out that the fundamentals (a weak dollar, high gold prices, and a stock market poised to fall) all seemed to indicate long-term strength for gold.The takeaway was this.... gold miners may fall this week. If you are a short term investor then you will take some lumps on this. If you can stomach holding onto the stocks for awhile then you can most likely ride out this fall for a week or two then get a nice uptrend back to all-time highs. Gold miners have largely structured their operations to make profit above the $1500/ounce price line since that is where gold has been hanging out for awhile now. With the new costs associated with Covid it has pushed the mining costs to about $1600-1650/ounce. At current prices that is going to most likely mean profit boosts of several hundred percent for the big miners for Q2 and especially Q3 and onwards.So, if you are a technical or short-term investor then jump ship now. If you are more of a long-term person then hold on and wait. Pretty simple."

"Why are miners not trading higher today? All indicators point higher...Gold is up, weak dollar, lower 10 year. The big short funds, Fed and whoever else is behind this is manipulating prices here..it is very obvious."
"Can anyone find another miner out there with virtually no debt (38Million USD), that produces over 1.5 million ounces of gold a year, and has a P/E of 5 or less, and an AISC of $1460 per ounce? 2021 revenues rose from 1.86 billion to 2.71 Billion. What more do you want from a company? We should be at $10 a share!"
Please help. Hi everyone first off let me apologize for such a noob question. My question is about the holding more than 1 year holding period tax deduction. If I buy some of this stock today but but were to then buy more of it 6 months from today does that reset the 1 year holding period tax deduction to 1 year from second purchase or is it still from the first purchase. Again my apologies for the noob question and thank you in advance for your time.
"Hmy is way overpriced. Way exceeding twice the % rise in the price of gold as normal for gold miners. It's priced for gold to be over $2,000/oz. All downside risk now."
"Well we are still at a crossroads.. do we break up or do we break down? And how much will the Jackson Hole conference at the end of the month impact us? Goldman still says Gold 2000 and China is buying more Gold, so I am betting on Up. I suppose all longs are."
"So whats the outlook on this one everyone? I am going to hold my shares as I can only imagine with demand of technology increasing gold and silver will rise no matter what. Every ""analyst"" always seems to miss that the electronics they are using to be bearish about gold and silver, has hardware made from gold and silver. Why can no one recognize that we are exponentially expanding technology, which will result in more gold and silver being mined. Can't trade your bitcoin without the help of gold and silver."
"With the market weakening, likely the FED will not be tapering soon, and with inflation, perhaps this will give Gold an excuse to run?"
"I urge everyone who has this stock to put in a sell order above 6.00 good untill canceled, prevent the shorties from borrowing your stock."
“HMY is the superior value option right now.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hmy-aem-better-value-stock-154003783.html
"We won't know where Gold is going until Powell signals where the taping is going. If there is tapering, that will take Gold down, with the market. If no tapering for a while, hopefully Gold will be going up."
Wells Fargo just came out with a report that it expects Gold to soon resume its rise and that China is stepping up is Gold Purchases significantly. I'm considering bottom feeding here...I just have so much HMY already.
With 250 T of debt in the world and growing daily there's only 10 T of gold. Kitco believes a 50% increase in gold price to 2250 could happen bringing 15T as debt soars as a balance. Trading channel to 1620 next...

Surprised it's dropping.
Guidance raised. Production much higher for 2021 and being raised for 2022
"China buying gold again. Banks needing gold. Goldman Sachs says Gold can hit as high as 2500, depending on the assumptions but those assumptions look like reality, higher inflation, lower growth."
"Read the on the HMY website the update and found the following highlights:All In Sustaining Costs for 2020 Q1 up 14.5% to $1,298/oz. Gold price in Rand increased 21%Avg Grade/ton: 5.68, +.37Gold production was down 8.5%HMY plans to issue upto $200 Million worth of new shares."
Seeking Alpha reports production in line w guidance however aisc increased. Buy the dip and be happy u did
The large holders are manipulating lower to try and squeeze retail holders out at cheap prices on HMY. By days end/ next week it will probably be closer to 4 then much higher
Looks like we are finally heading in the right direction! A few more days like this and we will be back over $4.
"The more money the FED prints out of thin air, the harder the market can crash and the higher silver and gold will go up"
"$hmy underpacing gold yet again steal of a buy. Dividend 3.8%, earnings whopping 60¢/share, just paid off half its debt, only $38m USD debt left.17% undervalued, that is 17% lower than last time gold was at current price. $au $gold $nem $fnv"
I see a valuable company with its stock price suddenly beaten down. I am using this opportunity to build a position back down at the bargain price.
"HMY reduced its net debt by 75% last year. It has only 40 million USD of net debt left on its books, if I read correctly and will have no debt by later this year! Positive free cash flow as we move forward! Who else can give you these prospects? This is a screaming buy."

"What do you think of this? If we bounce off 1260 I think we will see 1400 (or close to it very soon). Otherwise, before year end will be trading near 1380 levels by the looks of things. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iip9fzOz/"
"Keep in mind that HMY has reset after its earnings report. Pre-earnings, with gold flirting with 1800, HMY would be about 4.30 and if gold hit 1900, would be over 5 on its way to 6. So for whatever reason, hmy has been devalued by the market, likely due to rising production costs imho."
"HMY traded down to $3.75 for a few days between Feb 17th and March 3rd, when gold had its last drop to 1685. Whats interesting is the HMY was down to the high 3's when Gold was at the same price as today, 1775-1785. It actually gained in value as gold dropped to lower temporarily before bouncing back. I think the same will happen. Maybe a little more pain and then a very strong rise back to $5-6 in the coming weeks. Earnings will be better as gold has been strong the past few months. I don't see any negatives, unless there is some political situation we are not aware of yet."
"I am amazed at where the price is right now but it is a given there will be another stimulus. The only question is the size and when. The dollar will still go down and the price of gold will go up. Also volume has dropped off significantly these last few days, so I am not putting much stock in the continually downward price. I think this is a great buying opportunity and I would be willing to bet (actually I am betting significant amounts) that this will be back above 6.00 before this is all over."
CPI data is due out this week.
I’m not a chart expert at all but it looks like a bull flag is forming on the 3 month chart
Add when you can... any bad news will have these gold miners stocks running again. IAG & EGO have pulled back too. Keep stacking when you can!
"Plenty of room to run, should be well over $4.00 already"
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 5.90% to 3.77
"People waiting for US August jobs report, due out this morning. A weaker than expected report will be good for gold."
HMY should be back above $4 once Gold hits $1800.
"Thinking of buying.. take a look at the transcript of the last earnings report. They expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets go with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. That's before administrative costs. So Gold probably needs to stay above 1700 just for HMY to break even, once you add in the admin costs (I haven't figured that out per ounce) . That is why this stock is now flirting with breaching 3. High Cost, limited revenue. No growth. Stay away. I'm not worried about anybody here buying or selling. There are too many shares in the float for any small yahoo purchases or sales to have an impact on the price. But I hate to see people throwing their good money away. Me, I will continue holding, probably for years if I have to, but I expect zero return from this investment anytime soon, not to mention the large loss I already have due to owning it for over a year. I'm usually pretty quick to get out of investments when they turn sour. I don't know why I was so enamored with Gold. And when Buffet originally bought Barrack, I should have dumped HMY and bought Barrack too if I wanted to stay invested. Live and learn I guess..."
An investment firm called Fairtree took a 5% stake in it last week. I read they also invest long-term
"One good thing, volume is way down for today, 2.6 million so far vs. a 50 day moving average of volume of over 6 million per day. That tells me there is not a lot of conviction to sell at these low levels, so it may well be shorting in an attempt to catch the low hanging fruit. I expect volume will go up with price going up in the near future. We will see."
Earning report at SEC dot gov.Harmony Gold earned $0.15 per share. Nicely profitable. HMY will be even more profitable at the level gold price is at now. They have a lot of assets and small debt. HMY could go over $2.50 per share.
"Have to admit, I bought DUST as a reverse ETF arbitrage move Friday afternoon. The POG has been advancing maybe a little ""too nicely"" these past two weeks. Also noticed that the short % has been increasing in most miners since December. I want to stay positive on gold and especially HMY. Just couldn't help but buy a little insurance though. ~ Go Patriots!"
"High Volume day up today, over 12 Million, which is twice the average and a good sign since volume went up with the price."

"Well whatever HMY is doing right now due to hedge funds, we already know the score. Hmy met its production goals as reported a few months ago. The stock is fairly valued right now between 4.80 and 6.10. If Gold can get up to 1870 or so, as is likely later this year, it may well fly to 2300 based on the technical outlook. They are playing the game here they always play. Take it down as far as possible, catch the bottom lying fruit, then take it back up, sell high, rinse and repeat. Now that I see how this game is played, I am going to be playing it along with them."
"Of course if the US market craters due to congressional games playing, perhaps Gold actually will go up, for a short while anyway."
"My final word, I now understand why HMY is facing these headwinds. It was all discussed in the earnings call and can be read in the available transcripts. People for now are simply moving into shorter term plays. Its really that simple."

"My guess is the market is predicting fed tightening ...bad for stocks, bad for gold short time."
"This company is a typical value trap. It supposedly has a low P/E, but will investors ever seen any of that money? The dividend STINKS considering how much money they are supposedly making. This company needs to triple the dividend if they want to attract investors. Another problem is that the investor information is terrible. Yahoo does not show press releases, and there are not even any analyst estimates. Why does this company bother with a U.S. listing? It seems to make very little effort to inform U.S. investors."
"One other thing, because the Stock is now trading below $5.00, I'm assuming a number of institutions had to sell. Perhaps it would be a good idea if HMY did a reverse stock split, say 1-4, reducing the float and increasing the price."

3 percent drop?? This stock should be around $3.20. I have it as a BUY on my list.
"Gold up near 2016 highs, strong fundamentals and a book value of around 5-6$ - how is this down? :/"
"Perhaps the problem with HMY is the increase in ASCI? ""The average gold price received during 2021 was $1,719 versus $1,461 in 2020. AISC for 2021 was $1,460 per ounce vs. $1,293 per ounce in 2020""."
"Okay, so per the earnings report, they expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets lo with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. Not sure exactly what goes into ASCI, whether it includes salaries and admin costs, but regardless, it is up about 9% or so, so Gold needs to stay above 1700 and preferably 1800 for a decent profit"
"Commercial gold hedge short protective bets under their long positions at historic lows. Very bullish , happened before 1924 high also. Called COT"
AISC is around $1400 an ounce for HMY; It has been making about $400-450 an ounce of positive free cash flow per ounce of gold mined for the past quarter. Stock should be much much higher.
My NEM and other gold stocks are up decently. Why not my HMY? Hmmmm!
AMAZING Earnings!!!! Just looked on website. We should be over $4 right now....
"So Gold failed to reach 1830, which it needed to do on the technicals to head up to 2300. Now it from a technical standpoint it may fall back into the 1600s. HMY lost two workers on Monday and closed a major mine. The Hui Gold Bug index was finally a buy in the beginning of May 2021, but a sell at the end of June and has not been a buy since then. Bitcoin meanwhile seems to be kicking Gold's rearend. It may be finally time to sell HMY, take my lumps and stop the pain. Tough decision. If I say, I will never look at Gold again. I just think it is much easier to make money in equities that are dependent on the value of their product, and not the price of something which they have no control over."
"May have been amazing earnings but how is it being sold? Misses by .15 earnings, misses by 130 Million revenue"". That is the way the game is played."
I highly recommend watching the Michael Gentile interview with Kitco from two days ago. It is very telling for where Gold may be going in the future.
Let me speculate. Somebody is accumulating HMY shares as cheaply as possible because it intends to buy the company out? Maybe they are in negotiations right now? Why has HMY not declared a dividend besides all of its cash flow?
"I have posted the same question twice and twice my post has been removed. A fair question too, having to do with why the price of hmy was so much higher 10 years ago when price of gold so much lower. Yahoo I do not trust your people or your data so I will never pay a penny for your services. There is far better than you out there. Hire more quality people and maybe I would sign up for your financial data, but the trust is not there."
"Only traders care about how a vacine might affect gold. INVESTORS know about monetary policy, bail-outs, interest rates, and continual money printing affecting it. HMY 18 by mid 2021."
Every one knew non-farm payrolls would be higher this month as people get off unemployment benefits that come to an end on Sept 1. I don't think the workforce will improve much more though unless infrastructure bill passes. This will increase debt and should be good for gold. All this current and increasing inflation will benefit gold...
"Most of the miners are up a few percent today. HMY one of the few down. I do think somebody is holding this down, but why? Is somebody buying the shares up and trying to get them as cheap as possible?"
Well here we are with that one year retrace to $3.75. I hope that the last of it and we finally start a upward trend! HMY deserves a much higher price. Virtually debt free and positive cash flow moving forward...
Big boys on the move now. They really need this to be under $3.50. Make them pay. Keep buying towards closing.
Laggard in mining space worth adding
"Doubled + in a month and still undervalued, perfect investment"
"By Tuesday it will be 3.9 i guess, catchup of last few manipulated days and going forward Gold will keep rising steadily"
Any other recommended stocks for Gold Mining? I think its time.
A short attack is underway here with this stock just as there is with a few other miners. What are they trying to prove?
Drop probably due to options expiration....Someone wants stock to trade under $3.50 to make options worthless.

Where is the bottom? Perhaps 1.56 imo which is the 12 month low. I think this is a high quality company and should recover given enough time. GLTA
Down 2 weeks HMY time for a rise. FED will not hike rates anytime soon. Inmfact more stimulus coming. Delta Variant growing stronger. HMY $4.00 then $5.50!
"IMO this company shows great investor potential for future gains and is presently severely undervalued / overlooked. Any ideas as to why this stock has fallen out of favour? With a value of 1.01Billion , Price/Book value 0.36, small amount of debt relative to cash/ income/ assets compared to many other miners and a solid book value of 5.6$ I'm surprised this stock hasn't shot up past this book value - I can easily see this at around 8$ with further increases in gold price. Am I too optimistic / missing something?"
"$1800 gold here we go! Can't wait to also get my $5000 dividend...its been a rough ride, but I looks like we are finally be making some good profits in the coming months!"
Dropping no surprise. Excellent buy. Give me a $0.20 drop and I'll buy more.
"As the market, cryptos, Real Estate and everything else I can think of hit nose bleed levels, gold is the only value left. Will see new highs by Q1 2022. GLTA"
Up over 7% today! Not bad. Let's see if we can build on that next week and get back above $4. A positive earnings announcement should take us closer to $5.
Hmy may have unlimited upside and will keep going up till we have a real vaccine -
"Earnings, profits was solid, they growing and making money HMY $5+ or they will get bought out. Junior miner gets swallowed buy a major like Barrick, NEM"

"Buy, this mid tier miner with a PE under 10, added 10k shares today. Also added to my AUY position. This is such a discount and way out of proportion to the present price of gold. What a gift."
"Gurufocus puts out a hit against HMY’s valuation. PE is under 12, recent increases in production and the progress at Wolfi Golpu suggest otherwise. The mm’s are working very hard to get the price down and they probably will succeed, very unfortunate. I’am bullish on gold, but unfortunately the Market is not."
"High volume this morning at the open. 1 million shares traded in just the first 10 minutes of trading, and now 4.4 million as of 10:35 am. This could be the capitulation we have been waiting for. If we can finish flat or positive, it could be a sign we probably hit bottom. I can't see stock going much lower..take a look at the 10 year chart and stock was trading in much higher ranges, in the $13-15 range between 2002-2008 when gold was $300-900 and ounce. The company has never been in as financially sound a position as it is today, with almost no debt and a gold price of $1800."
"Okay, any reasonable guesses when this is back over $5.00. I'm thinking not until we'll into 2022..unless the bottom falls out due to us default, and people flee to gold."
"Spent some time today on the HMY homepage and reading its financial statements, CEO presentation, etc. I used to be an accountant, but mining and the specific's related to accounting for reserves, depletion etc. is beyond me, so I am not going to try and will rely on somebody who has an expertise in the financial accounting for mining operations. I will just note, that production costs increased 37% in US dollars from 524 million to 933 million. That is pretty significant. There were various impairments at some of the mines, like a 70 million impairment at one in particular. Debts decreased from 895 million to 542 million, don't know what the interest expense on that debt was, but as I recall (didn't write it down), the carrying cost of retiring that debt saves about 15 million or so for the next year. If so, that indicates a carrying cost of about 4.2%. At any rate, probably what has hurt the company more than anything are significantly production costs. Obviously if gold continues going up, that will not be a problem, but the market may be anticipating that even if gold goes up temporarily, it may not stay up long term... and the market is forward looking, so that is probably why we are where we are. Given the financials and the large amount of debt, I would not be expecting a buyout anytime soon. Right now cash flow is strong, debt has been reduced, grade is up on some of the recently acquired minds, but there are too many pieces for me to know what is important in gold mining..whatever it is that the market is considering, it does not like what it sees. Still, if Gold can breach 2000, this stock should be back above 5 or more. Just my random thoughts."
did anyone see 60 minutes last night about what is happening 60 miles down in South Africa s HMY gold mine and its future?
"One other thing I will note, that the stock has been falling in greater than average volume these last few days. 9.5 million shares traded. Given there are 600 million plus shares out there, that is not a lot, but still more than average. As they say, volume is conviction....I am guessing some weak hands have been selling. No choice though but to hold even through another down day....4.5% so far."
Gold up hmy down. Gold down hmy gets crushed 
"Bought at 3.45. Guess I should have waited a few days. Well, story of my life. :("
"Unless the earnings report is disappointing, that 24 million share short position will have to cover soon. There could be a huge spike up next week if earnings are good and gold keeps rising back towards $2000."

"I keep wondering who the people are that are selling their shares at these lows? 2.6 million shares today and over 4 million yesterday. Who is selling here and why? Is it mostly hedge funds selling to each other trying to get cheap shares, or are people that afraid that price will keep dropping?"
Gold up almost $30..HMY being manipulated
"why is HMY going down despite Gold stabilizing for the day and heading back up? Is it the fact two people were killed, or is HMY playing the technicals and assuming Gold now has a lot farther to fall? Probably a little of both. I have a list of well over 100 miners and HMY, though not at the bottom, is in the bottom 20% for percentage loss today.........Figures."
one of the best bargins in the market. in for 10k shares....lets goooooo!
"758% increase in net profit and the share price lost almost 20% in a month and almost 5% premarket?!!! A big question mark yet, we keep hoping for a fair share price"
Premarket-Joke: Somebody sells in 100-shares-steps. Heavy manipulated. Don't give up. This is manipulation!
"Stochastics measured on a scale of 1 to 100. 80 is overbought and usually means a pullback. 20 is oversold and usually means a rally. Right now stochastics on a three month chart is about 4.75. About as low as I have ever seen it. But RT is still well below 1, so I still don't think this is a good buy for a trade at this price."
Seems hedge funds are holding down and building huge positions gor run upwards in coming weeks
"Looks like this stock is going to under preform today. I suggest purchasing a few more shares as this will rise. Covid relief is no where near over, the fed is pumping unfathomable amounts of dollars into the market artificially boosting stock prices. Its basic economics you cant just create all of this money and never pay it off. And the US can never pay off their debt, it would be impossible. The fed can never increase rates now without taxing Americans more than they already are. People can barely afford the taxes now, if the fed increased rates it would kill the middle and lower classes."

"What's going on? Guesses? Not selling but it sure seems like somebody is manipulating here, somehow."
This will be up next week to catchup the GOLD price. And now that GOLD has kicked off the momentum will keep going in Sept. We probably will very likely see 5 by EOM
"Emailed and received an update for those interested : (Lauren Fourie) "" I followed up with the security team this morning. The investigation into the Kalgold heist/armed robbery is still ongoing and Harmony will provide an update as soon as further information is available.12kg or 386oz is less than 0.04% of Harmony’s production, furthermore Harmony has insurance in place. --->"
can somebody stop this manipulation?
"Just so you all know, Barrick since its high last year is down 41.32%. HMY is down from its high last year 57.32%. That is during a period of high inflation and worries about the economy. So tell me again how Gold is a hedge against inflation or chaos?"
"Once again, my innocuous posts were deleted talking about hmy historical prices, that were informative imo. I have been searching for some good message boards out there and there are some that might cost a little but are far superior to Yahoo. Its a shame, Yahoo once had very good boards...i rank it as among the worst out there at this point and Yahoo will never get a dime from me for their financial information as a result."
Bought 3100 shares
"We are now trading at 52 week low, back when gold was at $1680 or so...this drop is unwarranted and ridiculous. Miners are making huge profits here with positive free cash flow. All in costs for HMY are around 1400 per ounce."
I like HMY out of all the other gold related stocks. Sales last year were over a billion and the stock value is closer to $11. I have 1k shares but new month is coming...will add more on the dips.
"@Fencer, remember you back from the ego board a while back. Thinking of adding this. General question, which could save me some time researching...how much in gold reserveres does hmy have total ownership after jv's and is there anything ego/certej going on with the reserves where the reserves at a particular mine will nevet be dug up but is counted towards reserves? Any significant copper at all? Thanks in advance."
Any news on the seismic event that killed 2 workers and closed mine in South Africa?
"Wafi-Golpu got its environmental permits signed 2 weeks ago. New Guinea needs the cash cow now. The mine will produce 450,000 ounces annually solely owned and operated by Harmony. Goto webpage for info."
I'm looking at really low valued gold companies and this came up.Seems like really discounted but what the heck is up with all the fatalities? I'm on there IR page... 2021 7 fatalities this year.Underground mines but Jesus this doesn't seem normal.What the heck is going on?(I own no shares but interested)
Options expiration might be playing a part in suppression of stock price..hard for them to keep HMY under $3.50. Lets see what happens later today...
