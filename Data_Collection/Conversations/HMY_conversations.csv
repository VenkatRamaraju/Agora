Just bought 1500 shares
good entry point!
"We won't know where Gold is going until Powell signals where the taping is going. If there is tapering, that will take Gold down, with the market. If no tapering for a while, hopefully Gold will be going up."
GOLD going to $1600 you best believe that
this really is a terrible platform. Yahoo removes posts at will with no rhyme or reason. Anybody have any recommendations for a better run forum by chance with a good HMY board?
can somebody stop this manipulation?
"Doubled + in a month and still undervalued, perfect investment"
This is completely unfair
"Perhaps the problem with HMY is the increase in ASCI? ""The average gold price received during 2021 was $1,719 versus $1,461 in 2020. AISC for 2021 was $1,460 per ounce vs. $1,293 per ounce in 2020""."
"The problem now is traders are buying hmy at lower lows and selling at lower highs. Can't blame them, but that is going to make it more difficult to break through resistance."
"I urge everyone who has this stock to put in a sell order above 6.00 good untill canceled, prevent the shorties from borrowing your stock."
Earning report at SEC dot gov.Harmony Gold earned $0.15 per share. Nicely profitable. HMY will be even more profitable at the level gold price is at now. They have a lot of assets and small debt. HMY could go over $2.50 per share.
"Look at the 5-day, 1-month, 6-month, 1-year GDX, the 1-year POG chart and the CME gold futures. Throw in the slowing world economy just for fun...Now, give me one good reason not to be owning HMY...."
Any other recommended stocks for Gold Mining? I think its time.
“HMY is the superior value option right now.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hmy-aem-better-value-stock-154003783.html
"I have been following this closely and think we might actually repeat what we did June-July 2016 with a steep run-up to 4$ +. My original analysis indicated a 2$ price target however it seems that gld has held better than anticipated. With stocks this frothy a steep retrace in the coming month wouldn't be surprising together with a drop in the dollar. A combination of a stock correction, currency devaluation and a ~7-8% gld retrace could lead to the next leg up to the 1500-1600$ range. Gld seems poised to snap higher if it can break the downward channel, likewise a breakdown below would lead to a target of roughly 1360-1380 gld. Personally, it seems to me that we might break higher as GLD consolidates at the current level. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0SurZ4tE/"
Down 2 weeks HMY time for a rise. FED will not hike rates anytime soon. Inmfact more stimulus coming. Delta Variant growing stronger. HMY $4.00 then $5.50!
"High Volume day up today, over 12 Million, which is twice the average and a good sign since volume went up with the price."
"People waiting for US August jobs report, due out this morning. A weaker than expected report will be good for gold."
What is the result expected for Q 3 ?. All indicators tell us that the results must be better than in previews two ones. The new management have to show capabilities for running this company and paying dividends as they promised and said. Personally on current stock price I loose some small money but I trust to see a better future very soon.
"$hmy underpacing gold yet again steal of a buy. Dividend 3.8%, earnings whopping 60¢/share, just paid off half its debt, only $38m USD debt left.17% undervalued, that is 17% lower than last time gold was at current price. $au $gold $nem $fnv"
Hefty climb in HMY today. People realizing it is undervalued. A 9% rise in stock price. An undervalued gold mine.
I like HMY out of all the other gold related stocks. Sales last year were over a billion and the stock value is closer to $11. I have 1k shares but new month is coming...will add more on the dips.
"Once again, my innocuous posts were deleted talking about hmy historical prices, that were informative imo. I have been searching for some good message boards out there and there are some that might cost a little but are far superior to Yahoo. Its a shame, Yahoo once had very good boards...i rank it as among the worst out there at this point and Yahoo will never get a dime from me for their financial information as a result."
Please help. Hi everyone first off let me apologize for such a noob question. My question is about the holding more than 1 year holding period tax deduction. If I buy some of this stock today but but were to then buy more of it 6 months from today does that reset the 1 year holding period tax deduction to 1 year from second purchase or is it still from the first purchase. Again my apologies for the noob question and thank you in advance for your time.
"I am starting to get interested in this stock even though it has had a good run. Many companies I review have significant problems. Digital Currencies have 2 problems (high fees + Controlled Access to funds) - digital currencies could have replaced gold but for these two challenges in my view. Gold is in limited supply, has strong liquidity, and is a more trusted currency. Major trading currencies continue to experience great volatility. HMY has a good balance sheet in my view and recently had good earings. Any guesses on the 12 month upside here?"
"Well whatever HMY is doing right now due to hedge funds, we already know the score. Hmy met its production goals as reported a few months ago. The stock is fairly valued right now between 4.80 and 6.10. If Gold can get up to 1870 or so, as is likely later this year, it may well fly to 2300 based on the technical outlook. They are playing the game here they always play. Take it down as far as possible, catch the bottom lying fruit, then take it back up, sell high, rinse and repeat. Now that I see how this game is played, I am going to be playing it along with them."
"With the market weakening, likely the FED will not be tapering soon, and with inflation, perhaps this will give Gold an excuse to run?"
"Kinrose Gold up 2.8% right now. Hmy down .85. Yep, somebody has ulterior motives here."
My NEM and other gold stocks are up decently. Why not my HMY? Hmmmm!
"EPS solid, revenue solid, HMY closed $3.84 should be $4.50+ with gold prices $1800+ easy! Buy buy buy!!! $6.00 buy Octocber when Delta Variant spreads1"
"I invested in HMY because it has more gold than most miners in the ground. Once gold goes higher, HMY will be valued correctly in space way high."
may june july august big strong months for gold/ silver and other precious metals Mining shares will move up nicely $IAG$GSS $GORO $GAU $HMY $BTG $GOLD $EXK $NGD $EQX
"IMO this company shows great investor potential for future gains and is presently severely undervalued / overlooked. Any ideas as to why this stock has fallen out of favour? With a value of 1.01Billion , Price/Book value 0.36, small amount of debt relative to cash/ income/ assets compared to many other miners and a solid book value of 5.6$ I'm surprised this stock hasn't shot up past this book value - I can easily see this at around 8$ with further increases in gold price. Am I too optimistic / missing something?"
Just wondering how soon before they suspend mining operations due to COVID19
I'm looking at really low valued gold companies and this came up.Seems like really discounted but what the heck is up with all the fatalities? I'm on there IR page... 2021 7 fatalities this year.Underground mines but Jesus this doesn't seem normal.What the heck is going on?(I own no shares but interested)
Anyone willing to comment on what “real” (more than merely public announcement that talks are restarting) progress on Wafi-Golpu Project would mean for Harmony share price?Talks appear to be resuming. I am speculating on price of gold and need for cash being too much to to destroy this project. Everyone wants it to happen? Harmony has an established presence and good reputation in PNG? The stalling and infighting in PNG is about scraps?What say you?
Ouch... 52 week low... and the bad months are still ahead.
Small caps with a low valuation could still rise despite the consolidation in gold prices.
"Just so you all know, Barrick since its high last year is down 41.32%. HMY is down from its high last year 57.32%. That is during a period of high inflation and worries about the economy. So tell me again how Gold is a hedge against inflation or chaos?"
CPI data is due out this week.
With 250 T of debt in the world and growing daily there's only 10 T of gold. Kitco believes a 50% increase in gold price to 2250 could happen bringing 15T as debt soars as a balance. Trading channel to 1620 next...
"Hmy is way overpriced. Way exceeding twice the % rise in the price of gold as normal for gold miners. It's priced for gold to be over $2,000/oz. All downside risk now."
Shameless company
This is way oversold. Stock was trading higher when Gold was at $1821 at the start of May.
"Well on our way to 1690. If that doesn't hold, 1580. Too late to sell now imho."
"max out the chart back to 1994, the pos has been above 3 for 98% of the time over 24 years. With gold on the rise I'm still buying"
"Looks like this stock is going to under preform today. I suggest purchasing a few more shares as this will rise. Covid relief is no where near over, the fed is pumping unfathomable amounts of dollars into the market artificially boosting stock prices. Its basic economics you cant just create all of this money and never pay it off. And the US can never pay off their debt, it would be impossible. The fed can never increase rates now without taxing Americans more than they already are. People can barely afford the taxes now, if the fed increased rates it would kill the middle and lower classes."
I see a valuable company with its stock price suddenly beaten down. I am using this opportunity to build a position back down at the bargain price.
"Gold up near 2016 highs, strong fundamentals and a book value of around 5-6$ - how is this down? :/"
Hmy may have unlimited upside and will keep going up till we have a real vaccine -
Price is a steal now and ready to move up sharply in days. 10X from here soon! Star performing AlphaNorth Asset Management was LEAD INVESTOR in new private placement when shares were $.36 https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5606254
up 70% in 2 weeks.
"bought a thousand more shares at $2.83, eventually, this will be a winning trade. They can't rig this market forever"
come on
"End of August I believe, but will there be any surprises? Unlikely. Technically Gold can still go down to 1780 or so but if it can manage to get above resistance around 1920 or so, it can get to 2300."
"Although this relates to BEAR market funds and inverse ETFs, the technical indicator discussed in this article (the death cross) is very helpful for those of us who seek other safe havens, such as gold-related stocks. Give 'er a read. Would love to hear comments. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-dips-below-200-185803581.html?.tsrc=fin-srch"
"Short interest has finally decreased a bit in the past two weeks by 1,460,000 shares! Even the shorts are covering at these levels. Everyone knows things will turn around."
"HMY reduced its net debt by 75% last year. It has only 40 million USD of net debt left on its books, if I read correctly and will have no debt by later this year! Positive free cash flow as we move forward! Who else can give you these prospects? This is a screaming buy."
well at least HYM met its guidance that its slightly reduced several months ago.
wow down 6 days row shorts and longs you have to wonder! lmaoa $3.50+ next few days!! hmy $5.00 very soon!
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 5.87% to 3.79
Why the big volume and price change today?
Shocking similarity in GLD consolidation with Feb-May 2019. Think we may be primed for a breakout in the next 1-2 weeks. https://www.tradingview.com/x/mZkyGhaw/
"Sell higher interest rates coming and tapering bond fed. Gold sell off $1500, then $1300, then $1200 hmy$2.50 like iag lmao"
"Read the on the HMY website the update and found the following highlights:All In Sustaining Costs for 2020 Q1 up 14.5% to $1,298/oz. Gold price in Rand increased 21%Avg Grade/ton: 5.68, +.37Gold production was down 8.5%HMY plans to issue upto $200 Million worth of new shares."
"I’m looking to buy more on any dip, maybe after gold reaches $1960. This will test the $15 level by the end of 2021, or sooner depending on when gold hits $2200."
Did something get mixed up with foreign currencies in the Yahoo Finance calculations? I'm finding it hard to believe that they have a price to sales ratio of 0.07.
"Only traders care about how a vacine might affect gold. INVESTORS know about monetary policy, bail-outs, interest rates, and continual money printing affecting it. HMY 18 by mid 2021."
"I think the stronger ZAR is weighing on the share price and I don't think they have any currency hedges in place at the moment. I'd have to do the math and look at the daily gold prices in the 2nd half to figure out whether the higher POG has outweighed the exchange rate, but i'm guessing the analysts have done it and it doesn't look too good."
I’m not a chart expert at all but it looks like a bull flag is forming on the 3 month chart
"One other thing, because the Stock is now trading below $5.00, I'm assuming a number of institutions had to sell. Perhaps it would be a good idea if HMY did a reverse stock split, say 1-4, reducing the float and increasing the price."
"2 M shares traded by 10 AM , volume often precedes price"
Beautiful chart.The best amongst gold miners.double benefit from strong gold price and weak currency.
one of the best bargins in the market. in for 10k shares....lets goooooo!
ER out tomorrow before market open.
The gap from last week has been closed....time to buy again.
"Wafi-Golpu got its environmental permits signed 2 weeks ago. New Guinea needs the cash cow now. The mine will produce 450,000 ounces annually solely owned and operated by Harmony. Goto webpage for info."
Options expiration might be playing a part in suppression of stock price..hard for them to keep HMY under $3.50. Lets see what happens later today...
Gold up hmy down. Gold down hmy gets crushed 
"HMY traded down to $3.75 for a few days between Feb 17th and March 3rd, when gold had its last drop to 1685. Whats interesting is the HMY was down to the high 3's when Gold was at the same price as today, 1775-1785. It actually gained in value as gold dropped to lower temporarily before bouncing back. I think the same will happen. Maybe a little more pain and then a very strong rise back to $5-6 in the coming weeks. Earnings will be better as gold has been strong the past few months. I don't see any negatives, unless there is some political situation we are not aware of yet."
3 percent drop?? This stock should be around $3.20. I have it as a BUY on my list.
I had been thinking that HMY - low priced as it was/is -- was like a perpetual gold option. What gives here?...can't even hold $3 with gold over 1500. Is it: Currency risk? .... Safety risk for how this company has operated?... Did they aggressively hedge their gold production at lower levels? ..... anyone actually have an idea?
The market apparently likes the details of HMY's new acquisition in South Africa. Up over ten percent on the announcement!
"Cheap prices for HMY given the current market conditions (0% interest & FED QE Infinity) & book value of ~4$. People throwing the baby out with the bathwater every time the market tanks. 25% undervalued at present value. Forward looking if GLD climbs higher it will shoot higher after breaking the ATH, could easily see a 2000$+ gold price by December 2020 imo. Accumulated some more today and will be adding given more opportunity!"
An investment firm called Fairtree took a 5% stake in it last week. I read they also invest long-term
"@Fencer, remember you back from the ego board a while back. Thinking of adding this. General question, which could save me some time researching...how much in gold reserveres does hmy have total ownership after jv's and is there anything ego/certej going on with the reserves where the reserves at a particular mine will nevet be dug up but is counted towards reserves? Any significant copper at all? Thanks in advance."
I highly recommend watching the Michael Gentile interview with Kitco from two days ago. It is very telling for where Gold may be going in the future.
"I've stopped trying to understand why this stock and others I hold (AG and SBGL) go up and own like yo yos for no discernible reason. Rigged? Probably. I'm holding long term in the conviction that gold and silver miners will ""leverage explode"" eventually when with the metals themselves really break out - 2021? 2022?"
"Where does hmy rank in the AscI department? Best i can tell, it is about twice the cost per ounce of the average miner. Now over 1500 per ounce. That's obviously a huge tail wind here."
Sorry for the recent spam - are we forming a giant bull flag? https://www.tradingview.com/x/wnCvRi9o/
"By Tuesday it will be 3.9 i guess, catchup of last few manipulated days and going forward Gold will keep rising steadily"
"SHORT TERM TRADING ROCKS HERE.....Very nice 5-6 cent moves on just 40,000 shares. Sold yesterday at 1.85 and bought 20,000 back at 1.79 to 1.80 this morning. Love more LOWER......."
"My guess is the market is predicting fed tightening ...bad for stocks, bad for gold short time."
"One other thing I will note, that the stock has been falling in greater than average volume these last few days. 9.5 million shares traded. Given there are 600 million plus shares out there, that is not a lot, but still more than average. As they say, volume is conviction....I am guessing some weak hands have been selling. No choice though but to hold even through another down day....4.5% so far."
"Basically mining stocks are just behaving like stocks - S&P up miners up, and vice versa. When is the ""fleeing to PM"" supposed to happen now? I see no sign of it. All I am now expecting is a sizable stock crash taking miners with it."
Looks like we are finally heading in the right direction! A few more days like this and we will be back over $4.
sGold up this wa down down 1% Gold down this is down 4 %Huge Manipulation for something big coming up and some one somehwere wants shares cheap. This week will be interesting. Any take ?
"The point is Buffet chose to hold a Gold mining stock, not a Gold or Gold stock. You know what is this meaning!?Long and hold HMY with Gold rush trend!!"
Let me speculate. Somebody is accumulating HMY shares as cheaply as possible because it intends to buy the company out? Maybe they are in negotiations right now? Why has HMY not declared a dividend besides all of its cash flow?
Lots of interest in HMY. Don't be tempted to jump to early.
"$.60 cents difference in stock price in three trading sessions...$4.35 to $3.75...retesting the recent low I guess. Not sure who would want to sell here. Its obvious US economy is not heading anywhere and inflation is here to stay. Interest rates are not going up for another couple years, if ever."
Gold price officially over $1800 inflation story will drive gold to all time new high $EGO $ELD $GDXJ $IAG $BTG $AUY $HMY
HMY should be back above $4 once Gold hits $1800.
3 Month consolidation in the range also seems very bullish to me. Has resisted breaking down multiple times. https://www.tradingview.com/x/MWqPYuO8/ We will see though...
One of the few miners where Share price is divergent with gold price.
"High volume this morning at the open. 1 million shares traded in just the first 10 minutes of trading, and now 4.4 million as of 10:35 am. This could be the capitulation we have been waiting for. If we can finish flat or positive, it could be a sign we probably hit bottom. I can't see stock going much lower..take a look at the 10 year chart and stock was trading in much higher ranges, in the $13-15 range between 2002-2008 when gold was $300-900 and ounce. The company has never been in as financially sound a position as it is today, with almost no debt and a gold price of $1800."
Does anyone know when HMY will pay its next dividend?
Looks like some of the reports were released today (looking very promising! ) : https://www.harmony.co.za/invest/reporting/fy19https://www.harmony.co.za/invest/company-announcements/2019/item/1019-investment-strategy-boosts-cash-flows
"Gurufocus puts out a hit against HMY’s valuation. PE is under 12, recent increases in production and the progress at Wolfi Golpu suggest otherwise. The mm’s are working very hard to get the price down and they probably will succeed, very unfortunate. I’am bullish on gold, but unfortunately the Market is not."
"Warren Bufffet bought Gold shares, I hope this will bring traders into gold stocks"

"Buy, this mid tier miner with a PE under 10, added 10k shares today. Also added to my AUY position. This is such a discount and way out of proportion to the present price of gold. What a gift."
"Simply look at future reserves. Gold isn't only metal out there. #AUY has 8 in-pipeline projects, pays dividend and has $50 BILLION copper/gold/silver/moly Agua Rica mine ready to go with recently closed Newmont Alumbrera mine infrastructure just 36km away. Do your own due diligence. Not suggesting you sell #HMY, but if you're looking for new investments in this sector, check out Yamana. gl"
"Every time Gold looks like it is about to break out, something or someone brings it back down. Really quite remarkable."
Got in at 1.95 this morning...haven't owned a South African Miner since I owned DROOY before Y2K.
"Only the price of gold is holding the pps of HMY, otherwise this is a $2.50 stock. Either buying or shorting HMY at this price has the same risk, price can move either way"
"Emailed and received an update for those interested : (Lauren Fourie) "" I followed up with the security team this morning. The investigation into the Kalgold heist/armed robbery is still ongoing and Harmony will provide an update as soon as further information is available.12kg or 386oz is less than 0.04% of Harmony’s production, furthermore Harmony has insurance in place. --->"
Tapering has already been reflected in gold prices. Gold moved higher after September CPI report. Markets finally acknowledging inflation is not transitory and will impact economy growth rates expect heavy safe-haven inflows in Q4.$EGO $GDXJ $GDX $IAG $BTG $AUY $HMY
"Feds will raise interest rates inflation too hot, gas $3.50 gal. and cpnsumer goods prices too high, gold will setback below $1700 very son then HMY $2.00 under! sell!!"
Announcement in a few days will send shares flying. Loads of cash in the bank and major drilling results on copper gold and cobalt. Shares are highly undervalued with tiny float and are close to starting big move.https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5583206-goldman-says-copper-is-new-oil-and-chile-is-saudi-arabia-of-copper-20-cent-rmes-holds-large
"Since March 20 now hmy is up 285% so it's priced for gold to be $3,600/oz up 142% since then. Way, way overpriced."
Looks like GLD and HMY are on the verge of breaking out in a big way. Would not be surprised to see 4$ within 2 weeks.
"Commercial gold hedge short protective bets under their long positions at historic lows. Very bullish , happened before 1924 high also. Called COT"
"$1800 gold here we go! Can't wait to also get my $5000 dividend...its been a rough ride, but I looks like we are finally be making some good profits in the coming months!"
Long slog back above 1900 and then 2000. Should just not pay attention.
"Thinking of buying.. take a look at the transcript of the last earnings report. They expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets go with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. That's before administrative costs. So Gold probably needs to stay above 1700 just for HMY to break even, once you add in the admin costs (I haven't figured that out per ounce) . That is why this stock is now flirting with breaching 3. High Cost, limited revenue. No growth. Stay away. I'm not worried about anybody here buying or selling. There are too many shares in the float for any small yahoo purchases or sales to have an impact on the price. But I hate to see people throwing their good money away. Me, I will continue holding, probably for years if I have to, but I expect zero return from this investment anytime soon, not to mention the large loss I already have due to owning it for over a year. I'm usually pretty quick to get out of investments when they turn sour. I don't know why I was so enamored with Gold. And when Buffet originally bought Barrack, I should have dumped HMY and bought Barrack too if I wanted to stay invested. Live and learn I guess..."
"This company is a typical value trap. It supposedly has a low P/E, but will investors ever seen any of that money? The dividend STINKS considering how much money they are supposedly making. This company needs to triple the dividend if they want to attract investors. Another problem is that the investor information is terrible. Yahoo does not show press releases, and there are not even any analyst estimates. Why does this company bother with a U.S. listing? It seems to make very little effort to inform U.S. investors."
"Most of the miners are up a few percent today. HMY one of the few down. I do think somebody is holding this down, but why? Is somebody buying the shares up and trying to get them as cheap as possible?"
What’s happening here? Some political issues in Papua Guinea??? Don’t understand why is so oversold…..
A short attack is underway here with this stock just as there is with a few other miners. What are they trying to prove?

"Gold is an obstacle to the complete control of societies, which is why the elite are doing their best to discourage us from this metal."
manipulated 100%
AMAZING Earnings!!!! Just looked on website. We should be over $4 right now....
"So whats the outlook on this one everyone? I am going to hold my shares as I can only imagine with demand of technology increasing gold and silver will rise no matter what. Every ""analyst"" always seems to miss that the electronics they are using to be bearish about gold and silver, has hardware made from gold and silver. Why can no one recognize that we are exponentially expanding technology, which will result in more gold and silver being mined. Can't trade your bitcoin without the help of gold and silver."
"Just noticed DXY 1985 peak is inline w 2002 to present peaks as resistance, crazy chart for gold bulls. Was 152. 35 yrs ago... it could be the end of strong dollar hurting gold price"
Big boys on the move now. They really need this to be under $3.50. Make them pay. Keep buying towards closing.
"I am amazed at where the price is right now but it is a given there will be another stimulus. The only question is the size and when. The dollar will still go down and the price of gold will go up. Also volume has dropped off significantly these last few days, so I am not putting much stock in the continually downward price. I think this is a great buying opportunity and I would be willing to bet (actually I am betting significant amounts) that this will be back above 6.00 before this is all over."
AISC is around $1400 an ounce for HMY; It has been making about $400-450 an ounce of positive free cash flow per ounce of gold mined for the past quarter. Stock should be much much higher.
"Unless the earnings report is disappointing, that 24 million share short position will have to cover soon. There could be a huge spike up next week if earnings are good and gold keeps rising back towards $2000."
"VAN ECK ASSOCIATES own 64 million shares, They seem to like it...."
"May have been amazing earnings but how is it being sold? Misses by .15 earnings, misses by 130 Million revenue"". That is the way the game is played."
Buy buy buy $4.00 coming!!!!!!!
why didnt i sell this when it was 2.50!!???
$5 at xmas again.....or else no presents...hahaaaa

"What's going on? Guesses? Not selling but it sure seems like somebody is manipulating here, somehow."
Guidance raised. Production much higher for 2021 and being raised for 2022
"I've traded in and out of Harmony as well as Yamana gold mining stocks for 15 years. Today is the first time in my memory that HMY had a higher PPS than AUY. Yeah.... I know, thanks for the public service announcement."
"China buying gold again. Banks needing gold. Goldman Sachs says Gold can hit as high as 2500, depending on the assumptions but those assumptions look like reality, higher inflation, lower growth."
Seeking Alpha reports production in line w guidance however aisc increased. Buy the dip and be happy u did
"Gentlemen......I just get this feeling that gold could be at $2,000.... and HMY would be at $3.10.... I've held Harmony for years - has been a frustration to say the least."
"Bought at 3.45. Guess I should have waited a few days. Well, story of my life. :("
This will be up next week to catchup the GOLD price. And now that GOLD has kicked off the momentum will keep going in Sept. We probably will very likely see 5 by EOM
"I have a feeling that if gold price hits 1300+ this share price is going to explode. Trump dumpster fire, shaky stock market and FUD - fear uncertainty doubt will cause a stampede to gold imo."
Seems many are unsure as to when this will breach 1400 (including myself). Was playing around with some charts and came up with this https://ibb.co/V3ktzJh What do you all think - 1400 before or after 2019? :) I am optimistic about this trend playing out faster than shown in this chart but fully anticipate a retracement to 1250-1260 levels before making a crack at the 1400 level. Thoughts?
"We are now trading at 52 week low, back when gold was at $1680 or so...this drop is unwarranted and ridiculous. Miners are making huge profits here with positive free cash flow. All in costs for HMY are around 1400 per ounce."
"Great ER coming out soon, in the next few weeks. Guidance will be fantastic"
Wells Fargo just came out with a report that it expects Gold to soon resume its rise and that China is stepping up is Gold Purchases significantly. I'm considering bottom feeding here...I just have so much HMY already.
"Double the volume on a big up day for actual metals...this down...USA fraud, worst cancer in the world hedegefunds live there.God does not exist I think...hahaa"
Might buy more at $2.5
"Added another 10k shares at 4.90, this is a buy now, feel bad for those that bought at the top. That Richard guy must have lost tons on it, he went from cheerleader to bullish. If you own it don’t sell it just ride the trough up to the next peaking wave. Gold will be 2300 year end."
"The trade war being started by Trump will be very helpful for gold prices. Dollar will start falling, time to buy gold is now."
"Can anyone find another miner out there with virtually no debt (38Million USD), that produces over 1.5 million ounces of gold a year, and has a P/E of 5 or less, and an AISC of $1460 per ounce? 2021 revenues rose from 1.86 billion to 2.71 Billion. What more do you want from a company? We should be at $10 a share!"
"Stochastics measured on a scale of 1 to 100. 80 is overbought and usually means a pullback. 20 is oversold and usually means a rally. Right now stochastics on a three month chart is about 4.75. About as low as I have ever seen it. But RT is still well below 1, so I still don't think this is a good buy for a trade at this price."
"What do you think of this? If we bounce off 1260 I think we will see 1400 (or close to it very soon). Otherwise, before year end will be trading near 1380 levels by the looks of things. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iip9fzOz/"
"A lot of people wondering why this stock (and other gold miners) has been selling off over the last few days.Technical investors flagged gold miners as being overbought based on the charts and there was a very high chance of a downward correction. That said, it did not predict the extent of the correction. The article also pointed out that the fundamentals (a weak dollar, high gold prices, and a stock market poised to fall) all seemed to indicate long-term strength for gold.The takeaway was this.... gold miners may fall this week. If you are a short term investor then you will take some lumps on this. If you can stomach holding onto the stocks for awhile then you can most likely ride out this fall for a week or two then get a nice uptrend back to all-time highs. Gold miners have largely structured their operations to make profit above the $1500/ounce price line since that is where gold has been hanging out for awhile now. With the new costs associated with Covid it has pushed the mining costs to about $1600-1650/ounce. At current prices that is going to most likely mean profit boosts of several hundred percent for the big miners for Q2 and especially Q3 and onwards.So, if you are a technical or short-term investor then jump ship now. If you are more of a long-term person then hold on and wait. Pretty simple."
Two vaccines just went to phase 3 trials - one by mRNA & one by azn which produces T-cells as well as antibodies. Yet hmy keeps rising? Why?
"Plenty of room to run, should be well over $4.00 already"
Short squeeze!!!
did anyone see 60 minutes last night about what is happening 60 miles down in South Africa s HMY gold mine and its future?
"I keep wondering who the people are that are selling their shares at these lows? 2.6 million shares today and over 4 million yesterday. Who is selling here and why? Is it mostly hedge funds selling to each other trying to get cheap shares, or are people that afraid that price will keep dropping?"
"One good thing, volume is way down for today, 2.6 million so far vs. a 50 day moving average of volume of over 6 million per day. That tells me there is not a lot of conviction to sell at these low levels, so it may well be shorting in an attempt to catch the low hanging fruit. I expect volume will go up with price going up in the near future. We will see."
Bought 3100 shares
When do we find out about a declared dividend? Didn't HMY promise to pay 20% of its free cash flow to its shareholders?
Every one knew non-farm payrolls would be higher this month as people get off unemployment benefits that come to an end on Sept 1. I don't think the workforce will improve much more though unless infrastructure bill passes. This will increase debt and should be good for gold. All this current and increasing inflation will benefit gold...
"earnings are expected next week, keep holding people, this may rise again!"
"US retail sales will be down huge for July, when announced next week. Gold will be back above $1800 by Wednesday"
"Why are miners not trading higher today? All indicators point higher...Gold is up, weak dollar, lower 10 year. The big short funds, Fed and whoever else is behind this is manipulating prices here..it is very obvious."
"I have posted the same question twice and twice my post has been removed. A fair question too, having to do with why the price of hmy was so much higher 10 years ago when price of gold so much lower. Yahoo I do not trust your people or your data so I will never pay a penny for your services. There is far better than you out there. Hire more quality people and maybe I would sign up for your financial data, but the trust is not there."
$HMY (key resistance level & volume booming)Currently sitting at 3.65 with lots of volume coming in. Excited for today's PM session; waiting for the rebound to $4.
PE below 5 placing my order now. Lol buy the dip or regret it for life.
"Have to admit, I bought DUST as a reverse ETF arbitrage move Friday afternoon. The POG has been advancing maybe a little ""too nicely"" these past two weeks. Also noticed that the short % has been increasing in most miners since December. I want to stay positive on gold and especially HMY. Just couldn't help but buy a little insurance though. ~ Go Patriots!"
"Earnings, profits was solid, they growing and making money HMY $5+ or they will get bought out. Junior miner gets swallowed buy a major like Barrick, NEM"
I got in at $6.30...Should I worry?
"Channel play between AUY and HMY. Both are top mining stocks. Read Yahoo, Penniless to Millions. GLTA"
"This price is a prima aprilis. Phisical gold is not available right now, and for sure not at this paper price..."
"Okay, so per the earnings report, they expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets lo with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. Not sure exactly what goes into ASCI, whether it includes salaries and admin costs, but regardless, it is up about 9% or so, so Gold needs to stay above 1700 and preferably 1800 for a decent profit"
Gold up almost $30..HMY being manipulated
"Hold the line folks, or this is the opportune time to buy more. Take advantage of the hedge funds trying to drive this down, they will be covering soon enough."
4.54 when gold was 1680. Gold is 1750 now. Goldman Sachs says it's going to 2750 by year end due to very low interest rate returns. Earnings are just getting better for hmy. ￼￼￼￼ I think we mlght see $8 by yr end or an acquisition.
Premarket-Joke: Somebody sells in 100-shares-steps. Heavy manipulated. Don't give up. This is manipulation!
Major Indices Down. Gold and Miners Up. The way it should be!
"TODAY: FROM THE MARKET REALIST ------>Harmony Gold (HMY) is trading at the lowest multiple among its peers at 2.6x. The company bought a mine from AngloGold in 2018 and funded the acquisition through shares. This equity issuance was the major reason for the stock’s underperformance in 2018. While it remains a higher-cost producer, its management is expecting the South African rand’s weakness to support its costs going forward. Higher gold prices and a weaker rand could also provide support for the company’s valuation."
Add when you can... any bad news will have these gold miners stocks running again. IAG & EGO have pulled back too. Keep stacking when you can!
"My final word, I now understand why HMY is facing these headwinds. It was all discussed in the earnings call and can be read in the available transcripts. People for now are simply moving into shorter term plays. Its really that simple."
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 5.90% to 3.77
Anyone know for certain if Harmony pays dividends? Don't trust yahoo finance info fully... Thanks in advance

Remember the earnings are tomorrow after market close. What are your views about last quarter earning?
Up over 7% today! Not bad. Let's see if we can build on that next week and get back above $4. A positive earnings announcement should take us closer to $5.
"Of course if the US market craters due to congressional games playing, perhaps Gold actually will go up, for a short while anyway."
The large holders are manipulating lower to try and squeeze retail holders out at cheap prices on HMY. By days end/ next week it will probably be closer to 4 then much higher
"Remember, all the investors buying the shares at these prices expect it to go up. Hang in there. This stock was $3.50+ on lower gold prices."
Where is the bottom? Perhaps 1.56 imo which is the 12 month low. I think this is a high quality company and should recover given enough time. GLTA
"MEMO: FOMC members insider trading during tumultuous but opportunistic 2020 was not great shocker. Covid 19 brought great human challenges but mostly great opportunities to invest and dominate. Eldorado Gold (EGO:NYSE ELD:TSX) is about to be re-rated higher in the short-term as Greek assets-counting for over 50% of current NAV-and somehow forgotten legacy style Lamaque mine and surrounding assets in Canada expanding at rapid pace. Precious metals washout is officially over. Quarter 3 reporting period majority of producing miners consensus will have stronger H2 with surprises on the upside regarding R&R statement eoy and overall liquidation level valuations offering discounts in share price not seen since start of pandemic. M&A has picked up in mining sector recently and will continue to accelerate in Australia, North America, Canada-too many players. M&A arbitrage with Eldorado Gold rated #1 most likely takeover target in Canada due to current extreme discount in share price and billions in NAV to be unlocked in the short term. Eldorado will release an updated feasibility study for Skouries mine ($250 AISC gold/copper) in Q4.$GDX $GXXJ $EGO $ELD $BTG $HMY $IAG $AUY $KL $AEM $NEM $GOLD $FNV"
$2.50 coming but first $3.49 and under today lmao FED will taper and commodities like gold crashes. Gold 1200 oz coming!
When are earnings due out?
"HMY will be good investment,but be patient ."
this stock has est to earn .69 a share in 2021 and a book value of $3.41 with low debt
"Might have got up from the table too soon, but sold st $4.10Will buy back on the next dip.Good luck and best wishes to you folks.~Dave"
"This is how I see it (on a macro scale). Long-term bullish, short term bearish. All speculation though xD (thoughts?) https://www.tradingview.com/x/tVeL8I2W/"
Trump wants to devalue the dollar. Being tweeted right now. This will be rocket fuel for HMY
June consumer inflation soared 3.4%. YIKES!!
Drop probably due to options expiration....Someone wants stock to trade under $3.50 to make options worthless.
"Well we are still at a crossroads.. do we break up or do we break down? And how much will the Jackson Hole conference at the end of the month impact us? Goldman still says Gold 2000 and China is buying more Gold, so I am betting on Up. I suppose all longs are."
$3.00 next stop for hmy
"The more money the FED prints out of thin air, the harder the market can crash and the higher silver and gold will go up"
"Okay, any reasonable guesses when this is back over $5.00. I'm thinking not until we'll into 2022..unless the bottom falls out due to us default, and people flee to gold."
Mining weekly has a great interview with the CEO excellent
"Okay, so Powell says that sooner rather than later the Fed will Taper and so accordingly interest rates are likely to go up, which will hurt Gold...I get it, BUT the market is flying once again. Can somebody tell me how Gold will ever again be a viable investment. It has basically done nothing since 2011, and now in a high inflation environment, it is doing nothing. What the heck does it take for Gold to go up a few hundred points?"
"Spent some time today on the HMY homepage and reading its financial statements, CEO presentation, etc. I used to be an accountant, but mining and the specific's related to accounting for reserves, depletion etc. is beyond me, so I am not going to try and will rely on somebody who has an expertise in the financial accounting for mining operations. I will just note, that production costs increased 37% in US dollars from 524 million to 933 million. That is pretty significant. There were various impairments at some of the mines, like a 70 million impairment at one in particular. Debts decreased from 895 million to 542 million, don't know what the interest expense on that debt was, but as I recall (didn't write it down), the carrying cost of retiring that debt saves about 15 million or so for the next year. If so, that indicates a carrying cost of about 4.2%. At any rate, probably what has hurt the company more than anything are significantly production costs. Obviously if gold continues going up, that will not be a problem, but the market may be anticipating that even if gold goes up temporarily, it may not stay up long term... and the market is forward looking, so that is probably why we are where we are. Given the financials and the large amount of debt, I would not be expecting a buyout anytime soon. Right now cash flow is strong, debt has been reduced, grade is up on some of the recently acquired minds, but there are too many pieces for me to know what is important in gold mining..whatever it is that the market is considering, it does not like what it sees. Still, if Gold can breach 2000, this stock should be back above 5 or more. Just my random thoughts."
"I finally agree with Charles, selling now is selling to the Grifters, charlatans, manipulators and the rest of the Cesspool we call Wall Street. With the infrastructure bill, and then the additional democratic spending proposals of trillions, once again Gold will go up significantly, and HMY, after it has been stolen from from the hands of the naive, will again be heading to five and above. The last few months of the year should be good for Gold. Once the market collapses because they finally have to cut back on QE and all of the injection of money into the system, who knows what Gold will do. Hopefully I will be out of the market by then."
Seems hedge funds are holding down and building huge positions gor run upwards in coming weeks
Advancing POG will make HMY a great buy for months to come. Opinion: Buy and hold for now.
"Someone keeps feeding the ask with lots of shares; most likely some naked shorting coming in from Europe somewhere. This should end soon as buying will just outpace the selling. Just too good of a company with positive fundamentals to keep price at such a discount. Company will be debt free in coming months, and have positive free cash flow going forward on all gold sold above AISC of $1370. PERIOD, nothing negative one can say here. Hundreds of millions of USD in profits will come in this year and stock will have to rise..or it will just buy back its shares with the profits. 400 million share float x $4 a share right now...company could theoretically take itself private and roast those short f%^&*%&*&^ in the process."
"without doubt, Gold is safe heaven for years from now.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-12/byron-wien-says-stocks-fully-priced-with-s-p-500-near-record"
Well here we are with that one year retrace to $3.75. I hope that the last of it and we finally start a upward trend! HMY deserves a much higher price. Virtually debt free and positive cash flow moving forward...
"1780 was support. Now it's resistance. Gold has to fight to get back to 1830, more resistance, than needs to fight to get to 1870. Hmy shareholders watching and waiting."
"758% increase in net profit and the share price lost almost 20% in a month and almost 5% premarket?!!! A big question mark yet, we keep hoping for a fair share price"
Last yrs tax selling began in haste Tues Dec 4th with gold rising 6% in 3 wks. Tues Dec 3 may be trapdoor opening this yr. China wants trump defeated so I can't imagine they want to aid his cause w signing anything meaningful now after kicking it down the road for 18 months already. And it's all over 10% but China holds way better cards
"Keep in mind that HMY has reset after its earnings report. Pre-earnings, with gold flirting with 1800, HMY would be about 4.30 and if gold hit 1900, would be over 5 on its way to 6. So for whatever reason, hmy has been devalued by the market, likely due to rising production costs imho."
