"With the market weakening, likely the FED will not be tapering soon, and with inflation, perhaps this will give Gold an excuse to run?"
Looks like we are finally heading in the right direction! A few more days like this and we will be back over $4.
sGold up this wa down down 1% Gold down this is down 4 %Huge Manipulation for something big coming up and some one somehwere wants shares cheap. This week will be interesting. Any take ?
"Just so you all know, Barrick since its high last year is down 41.32%. HMY is down from its high last year 57.32%. That is during a period of high inflation and worries about the economy. So tell me again how Gold is a hedge against inflation or chaos?"

"Can anyone find another miner out there with virtually no debt (38Million USD), that produces over 1.5 million ounces of gold a year, and has a P/E of 5 or less, and an AISC of $1460 per ounce? 2021 revenues rose from 1.86 billion to 2.71 Billion. What more do you want from a company? We should be at $10 a share!"
"Thinking of buying.. take a look at the transcript of the last earnings report. They expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets go with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. That's before administrative costs. So Gold probably needs to stay above 1700 just for HMY to break even, once you add in the admin costs (I haven't figured that out per ounce) . That is why this stock is now flirting with breaching 3. High Cost, limited revenue. No growth. Stay away. I'm not worried about anybody here buying or selling. There are too many shares in the float for any small yahoo purchases or sales to have an impact on the price. But I hate to see people throwing their good money away. Me, I will continue holding, probably for years if I have to, but I expect zero return from this investment anytime soon, not to mention the large loss I already have due to owning it for over a year. I'm usually pretty quick to get out of investments when they turn sour. I don't know why I was so enamored with Gold. And when Buffet originally bought Barrack, I should have dumped HMY and bought Barrack too if I wanted to stay invested. Live and learn I guess..."
"Keep in mind that HMY has reset after its earnings report. Pre-earnings, with gold flirting with 1800, HMY would be about 4.30 and if gold hit 1900, would be over 5 on its way to 6. So for whatever reason, hmy has been devalued by the market, likely due to rising production costs imho."
"Plenty of room to run, should be well over $4.00 already"
"High volume this morning at the open. 1 million shares traded in just the first 10 minutes of trading, and now 4.4 million as of 10:35 am. This could be the capitulation we have been waiting for. If we can finish flat or positive, it could be a sign we probably hit bottom. I can't see stock going much lower..take a look at the 10 year chart and stock was trading in much higher ranges, in the $13-15 range between 2002-2008 when gold was $300-900 and ounce. The company has never been in as financially sound a position as it is today, with almost no debt and a gold price of $1800."
A short attack is underway here with this stock just as there is with a few other miners. What are they trying to prove?
"Once again, my innocuous posts were deleted talking about hmy historical prices, that were informative imo. I have been searching for some good message boards out there and there are some that might cost a little but are far superior to Yahoo. Its a shame, Yahoo once had very good boards...i rank it as among the worst out there at this point and Yahoo will never get a dime from me for their financial information as a result."
"So Gold failed to reach 1830, which it needed to do on the technicals to head up to 2300. Now it from a technical standpoint it may fall back into the 1600s. HMY lost two workers on Monday and closed a major mine. The Hui Gold Bug index was finally a buy in the beginning of May 2021, but a sell at the end of June and has not been a buy since then. Bitcoin meanwhile seems to be kicking Gold's rearend. It may be finally time to sell HMY, take my lumps and stop the pain. Tough decision. If I say, I will never look at Gold again. I just think it is much easier to make money in equities that are dependent on the value of their product, and not the price of something which they have no control over."
Any other recommended stocks for Gold Mining? I think its time.
Gold price moving aggressively higher today $EGO $IAG $BTG $HMY $AUY $GDXJ $GDX
I'm looking at really low valued gold companies and this came up.Seems like really discounted but what the heck is up with all the fatalities? I'm on there IR page... 2021 7 fatalities this year.Underground mines but Jesus this doesn't seem normal.What the heck is going on?(I own no shares but interested)
Tapering has already been reflected in gold prices. Gold moved higher after September CPI report. Markets finally acknowledging inflation is not transitory and will impact economy growth rates expect heavy safe-haven inflows in Q4.$EGO $GDXJ $GDX $IAG $BTG $AUY $HMY
Dropping no surprise. Excellent buy. Give me a $0.20 drop and I'll buy more.
"Where does hmy rank in the AscI department? Best i can tell, it is about twice the cost per ounce of the average miner. Now over 1500 per ounce. That's obviously a huge tail wind here."
"Bought at 3.45. Guess I should have waited a few days. Well, story of my life. :("
"Okay, any reasonable guesses when this is back over $5.00. I'm thinking not until we'll into 2022..unless the bottom falls out due to us default, and people flee to gold."
"Perhaps the problem with HMY is the increase in ASCI? ""The average gold price received during 2021 was $1,719 versus $1,461 in 2020. AISC for 2021 was $1,460 per ounce vs. $1,293 per ounce in 2020""."
"$hmy underpacing gold yet again steal of a buy. Dividend 3.8%, earnings whopping 60Â¢/share, just paid off half its debt, only $38m USD debt left.17% undervalued, that is 17% lower than last time gold was at current price. $au $gold $nem $fnv"
Options expiration might be playing a part in suppression of stock price..hard for them to keep HMY under $3.50. Lets see what happens later today...
"As the market, cryptos, Real Estate and everything else I can think of hit nose bleed levels, gold is the only value left. Will see new highs by Q1 2022. GLTA"
Any news on the seismic event that killed 2 workers and closed mine in South Africa?
"Spent some time today on the HMY homepage and reading its financial statements, CEO presentation, etc. I used to be an accountant, but mining and the specific's related to accounting for reserves, depletion etc. is beyond me, so I am not going to try and will rely on somebody who has an expertise in the financial accounting for mining operations. I will just note, that production costs increased 37% in US dollars from 524 million to 933 million. That is pretty significant. There were various impairments at some of the mines, like a 70 million impairment at one in particular. Debts decreased from 895 million to 542 million, don't know what the interest expense on that debt was, but as I recall (didn't write it down), the carrying cost of retiring that debt saves about 15 million or so for the next year. If so, that indicates a carrying cost of about 4.2%. At any rate, probably what has hurt the company more than anything are significantly production costs. Obviously if gold continues going up, that will not be a problem, but the market may be anticipating that even if gold goes up temporarily, it may not stay up long term... and the market is forward looking, so that is probably why we are where we are. Given the financials and the large amount of debt, I would not be expecting a buyout anytime soon. Right now cash flow is strong, debt has been reduced, grade is up on some of the recently acquired minds, but there are too many pieces for me to know what is important in gold mining..whatever it is that the market is considering, it does not like what it sees. Still, if Gold can breach 2000, this stock should be back above 5 or more. Just my random thoughts."
"This company is a typical value trap. It supposedly has a low P/E, but will investors ever seen any of that money? The dividend STINKS considering how much money they are supposedly making. This company needs to triple the dividend if they want to attract investors. Another problem is that the investor information is terrible. Yahoo does not show press releases, and there are not even any analyst estimates. Why does this company bother with a U.S. listing? It seems to make very little effort to inform U.S. investors."
"758% increase in net profit and the share price lost almost 20% in a month and almost 5% premarket?!!! A big question mark yet, we keep hoping for a fair share price"
"why is HMY going down despite Gold stabilizing for the day and heading back up? Is it the fact two people were killed, or is HMY playing the technicals and assuming Gold now has a lot farther to fall? Probably a little of both. I have a list of well over 100 miners and HMY, though not at the bottom, is in the bottom 20% for percentage loss today.........Figures."
See you over $4. Junior miners way oversold. Higher bids on gold will result in a correction to the upside for this sector
"$1800 gold here we go! Can't wait to also get my $5000 dividend...its been a rough ride, but I looks like we are finally be making some good profits in the coming months!"
Announcement in a few days will send shares flying. Loads of cash in the bank and major drilling results on copper gold and cobalt.

"Short interest has finally decreased a bit in the past two weeks by 1,460,000 shares! Even the shorts are covering at these levels. Everyone knows things will turn around."
PE below 5 placing my order now. Lol buy the dip or regret it for life.
"People waiting for US August jobs report, due out this morning. A weaker than expected report will be good for gold."
"@Fencer, remember you back from the ego board a while back. Thinking of adding this. General question, which could save me some time researching...how much in gold reserveres does hmy have total ownership after jv's and is there anything ego/certej going on with the reserves where the reserves at a particular mine will nevet be dug up but is counted towards reserves? Any significant copper at all? Thanks in advance."
"MEMO: FOMC members insider trading during tumultuous but opportunistic 2020 was not great shocker. Covid 19 brought great human challenges but mostly great opportunities to invest and dominate. Eldorado Gold (EGO:NYSE ELD:TSX) is about to be re-rated higher in the short-term as Greek assets-counting for over 50% of current NAV-and somehow forgotten legacy style Lamaque mine and surrounding assets in Canada expanding at rapid pace. Precious metals washout is officially over. Quarter 3 reporting period majority of producing miners consensus will have stronger H2 with surprises on the upside regarding R&R statement eoy and overall liquidation level valuations offering discounts in share price not seen since start of pandemic. M&A has picked up in mining sector recently and will continue to accelerate in Australia, North America, Canada-too many players. M&A arbitrage with Eldorado Gold rated #1 most likely takeover target in Canada due to current extreme discount in share price and billions in NAV to be unlocked in the short term. Eldorado will release an updated feasibility study for Skouries mine ($250 AISC gold/copper) in Q4.$GDX $GXXJ $EGO $ELD $BTG $HMY $IAG $AUY $KL $AEM $NEM $GOLD $FNV"
The large holders are manipulating lower to try and squeeze retail holders out at cheap prices on HMY. By days end/ next week it will probably be closer to 4 then much higher
Laggard in mining space worth adding
