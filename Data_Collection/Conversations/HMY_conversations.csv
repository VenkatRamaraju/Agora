"Gentlemen......I just get this feeling that gold could be at $2,000.... and HMY would be at $3.10.... I've held Harmony for years - has been a frustration to say the least."
"IMO this company shows great investor potential for future gains and is presently severely undervalued / overlooked. Any ideas as to why this stock has fallen out of favour? With a value of 1.01Billion , Price/Book value 0.36, small amount of debt relative to cash/ income/ assets compared to many other miners and a solid book value of 5.6$ I'm surprised this stock hasn't shot up past this book value - I can easily see this at around 8$ with further increases in gold price. Am I too optimistic / missing something?"
The previous low of 1.56 did not serve as a support. Now it is not really clear where we will bottom!
Seems hedge funds are holding down and building huge positions gor run upwards in coming weeks
"Sell higher interest rates coming and tapering bond fed. Gold sell off $1500, then $1300, then $1200 hmy$2.50 like iag lmao"

June consumer inflation soared 3.4%. YIKES!!
3 Month consolidation in the range also seems very bullish to me. Has resisted breaking down multiple times. https://www.tradingview.com/x/MWqPYuO8/ We will see though...
"This price is a prima aprilis. Phisical gold is not available right now, and for sure not at this paper price..."
"This stock is always manipulated by someone. Keep buying more to average it down, you will be awarded soon."
South Africa in turmoil how will it effect Harmony?
Premarket + 5.56%. Any news?
"It is very important gold holds the line here. In not, next support level is 1690. And if it doesn't hold there, fib retracement takes it to 1580. I hate selling at these low prices, but damn that was a strong downdraft today. Keeping fingers crossed for next week."
"I've stopped trying to understand why this stock and others I hold (AG and SBGL) go up and own like yo yos for no discernible reason. Rigged? Probably. I'm holding long term in the conviction that gold and silver miners will ""leverage explode"" eventually when with the metals themselves really break out - 2021? 2022?"
Wells Fargo just came out with a report that it expects Gold to soon resume its rise and that China is stepping up is Gold Purchases significantly. I'm considering bottom feeding here...I just have so much HMY already.
"Gurufocus puts out a hit against HMY’s valuation. PE is under 12, recent increases in production and the progress at Wolfi Golpu suggest otherwise. The mm’s are working very hard to get the price down and they probably will succeed, very unfortunate. I’am bullish on gold, but unfortunately the Market is not."
Well here we are with that one year retrace to $3.75. I hope that the last of it and we finally start a upward trend! HMY deserves a much higher price. Virtually debt free and positive cash flow moving forward...
"Most of the miners are up a few percent today. HMY one of the few down. I do think somebody is holding this down, but why? Is somebody buying the shares up and trying to get them as cheap as possible?"
Why the big volume and price change today?
Small caps with a low valuation could still rise despite the consolidation in gold prices.
"Since March 20 now hmy is up 285% so it's priced for gold to be $3,600/oz up 142% since then. Way, way overpriced."
Why down 5 percenr on pre marlet ?
"Finally, looks like Gold bulls are waking up. I wonder if soaring inflation might have anything to do with it."
"I keep wondering who the people are that are selling their shares at these lows? 2.6 million shares today and over 4 million yesterday. Who is selling here and why? Is it mostly hedge funds selling to each other trying to get cheap shares, or are people that afraid that price will keep dropping?"
this really is a terrible platform. Yahoo removes posts at will with no rhyme or reason. Anybody have any recommendations for a better run forum by chance with a good HMY board?
"Spent some time today on the HMY homepage and reading its financial statements, CEO presentation, etc. I used to be an accountant, but mining and the specific's related to accounting for reserves, depletion etc. is beyond me, so I am not going to try and will rely on somebody who has an expertise in the financial accounting for mining operations. I will just note, that production costs increased 37% in US dollars from 524 million to 933 million. That is pretty significant. There were various impairments at some of the mines, like a 70 million impairment at one in particular. Debts decreased from 895 million to 542 million, don't know what the interest expense on that debt was, but as I recall (didn't write it down), the carrying cost of retiring that debt saves about 15 million or so for the next year. If so, that indicates a carrying cost of about 4.2%. At any rate, probably what has hurt the company more than anything are significantly production costs. Obviously if gold continues going up, that will not be a problem, but the market may be anticipating that even if gold goes up temporarily, it may not stay up long term... and the market is forward looking, so that is probably why we are where we are. Given the financials and the large amount of debt, I would not be expecting a buyout anytime soon. Right now cash flow is strong, debt has been reduced, grade is up on some of the recently acquired minds, but there are too many pieces for me to know what is important in gold mining..whatever it is that the market is considering, it does not like what it sees. Still, if Gold can breach 2000, this stock should be back above 5 or more. Just my random thoughts."
"One thing I have noticed about HMY stock trading...it has over 600 million shares outstanding and yet the 50 day moving average of trading is only a little over 6 million shares, so just 1% of the float trades on average per day (this morning...down, its a little over 3 million shares)?"
"Buy, this mid tier miner with a PE under 10, added 10k shares today. Also added to my AUY position. This is such a discount and way out of proportion to the present price of gold. What a gift."
"earnings are expected next week, keep holding people, this may rise again!"
Drop probably due to options expiration....Someone wants stock to trade under $3.50 to make options worthless.
"One good thing, volume is way down for today, 2.6 million so far vs. a 50 day moving average of volume of over 6 million per day. That tells me there is not a lot of conviction to sell at these low levels, so it may well be shorting in an attempt to catch the low hanging fruit. I expect volume will go up with price going up in the near future. We will see."
"Dilution disappointing..... But, putting it in to perspective, it adds 10% to the cost of purchasing what appears to be a quality high grade mine. It's down 30% from $2.20 it traded at just a few weeks ago. I think the sell off is overdone."
An investment firm called Fairtree took a 5% stake in it last week. I read they also invest long-term
"Simply look at future reserves. Gold isn't only metal out there. #AUY has 8 in-pipeline projects, pays dividend and has $50 BILLION copper/gold/silver/moly Agua Rica mine ready to go with recently closed Newmont Alumbrera mine infrastructure just 36km away. Do your own due diligence. Not suggesting you sell #HMY, but if you're looking for new investments in this sector, check out Yamana. gl"
"This is how I see it (on a macro scale). Long-term bullish, short term bearish. All speculation though xD (thoughts?) https://www.tradingview.com/x/tVeL8I2W/"
"This company is a typical value trap. It supposedly has a low P/E, but will investors ever seen any of that money? The dividend STINKS considering how much money they are supposedly making. This company needs to triple the dividend if they want to attract investors. Another problem is that the investor information is terrible. Yahoo does not show press releases, and there are not even any analyst estimates. Why does this company bother with a U.S. listing? It seems to make very little effort to inform U.S. investors."
did anyone see 60 minutes last night about what is happening 60 miles down in South Africa s HMY gold mine and its future?
"Gold up near 2016 highs, strong fundamentals and a book value of around 5-6$ - how is this down? :/"
"Why are miners not trading higher today? All indicators point higher...Gold is up, weak dollar, lower 10 year. The big short funds, Fed and whoever else is behind this is manipulating prices here..it is very obvious."
Nobody is paying attention here. Good.
"Can anyone find another miner out there with virtually no debt (38Million USD), that produces over 1.5 million ounces of gold a year, and has a P/E of 5 or less, and an AISC of $1460 per ounce? 2021 revenues rose from 1.86 billion to 2.71 Billion. What more do you want from a company? We should be at $10 a share!"
The market apparently likes the details of HMY's new acquisition in South Africa. Up over ten percent on the announcement!
"So whats the outlook on this one everyone? I am going to hold my shares as I can only imagine with demand of technology increasing gold and silver will rise no matter what. Every ""analyst"" always seems to miss that the electronics they are using to be bearish about gold and silver, has hardware made from gold and silver. Why can no one recognize that we are exponentially expanding technology, which will result in more gold and silver being mined. Can't trade your bitcoin without the help of gold and silver."
Anyone willing to comment on what “real” (more than merely public announcement that talks are restarting) progress on Wafi-Golpu Project would mean for Harmony share price?Talks appear to be resuming. I am speculating on price of gold and need for cash being too much to to destroy this project. Everyone wants it to happen? Harmony has an established presence and good reputation in PNG? The stalling and infighting in PNG is about scraps?What say you?
"Emailed and received an update for those interested : (Lauren Fourie) "" I followed up with the security team this morning. The investigation into the Kalgold heist/armed robbery is still ongoing and Harmony will provide an update as soon as further information is available.12kg or 386oz is less than 0.04% of Harmony’s production, furthermore Harmony has insurance in place. --->"
"Read the on the HMY website the update and found the following highlights:All In Sustaining Costs for 2020 Q1 up 14.5% to $1,298/oz. Gold price in Rand increased 21%Avg Grade/ton: 5.68, +.37Gold production was down 8.5%HMY plans to issue upto $200 Million worth of new shares."
Gold up almost $30..HMY being manipulated
up 70% in 2 weeks.
Two vaccines just went to phase 3 trials - one by mRNA & one by azn which produces T-cells as well as antibodies. Yet hmy keeps rising? Why?
$2.50 coming but first $3.49 and under today lmao FED will taper and commodities like gold crashes. Gold 1200 oz coming!
"China buying gold again. Banks needing gold. Goldman Sachs says Gold can hit as high as 2500, depending on the assumptions but those assumptions look like reality, higher inflation, lower growth."
"VAN ECK ASSOCIATES own 64 million shares, They seem to like it...."
3 percent drop?? This stock should be around $3.20. I have it as a BUY on my list.
"I've traded in and out of Harmony as well as Yamana gold mining stocks for 15 years. Today is the first time in my memory that HMY had a higher PPS than AUY. Yeah.... I know, thanks for the public service announcement."
Please help. Hi everyone first off let me apologize for such a noob question. My question is about the holding more than 1 year holding period tax deduction. If I buy some of this stock today but but were to then buy more of it 6 months from today does that reset the 1 year holding period tax deduction to 1 year from second purchase or is it still from the first purchase. Again my apologies for the noob question and thank you in advance for your time.
Anyone know for certain if Harmony pays dividends? Don't trust yahoo finance info fully... Thanks in advance
"I am starting to get interested in this stock even though it has had a good run. Many companies I review have significant problems. Digital Currencies have 2 problems (high fees + Controlled Access to funds) - digital currencies could have replaced gold but for these two challenges in my view. Gold is in limited supply, has strong liquidity, and is a more trusted currency. Major trading currencies continue to experience great volatility. HMY has a good balance sheet in my view and recently had good earings. Any guesses on the 12 month upside here?"
@HMY will hit $3.50 per stock before the end of this month.
"People waiting for US August jobs report, due out this morning. A weaker than expected report will be good for gold."
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 5.90% to 3.77
$EGO #HL #IAG #HMY looks like stimulus is going to pass  load your miner stocks !
Big boys on the move now. They really need this to be under $3.50. Make them pay. Keep buying towards closing.
Did something get mixed up with foreign currencies in the Yahoo Finance calculations? I'm finding it hard to believe that they have a price to sales ratio of 0.07.
Bottomed out?
The large holders are manipulating lower to try and squeeze retail holders out at cheap prices on HMY. By days end/ next week it will probably be closer to 4 then much higher
"no worries, bought 4000 euro yesterday."
This stock is on sale today - just added more
This is way oversold. Stock was trading higher when Gold was at $1821 at the start of May.
well at least HYM met its guidance that its slightly reduced several months ago.
"Okay, so per the earnings report, they expect future all in sustaining costs to be in the neighborhood of 765 thousand to 800 thousand ZAR per Kilogram. That translates to $54,456 to $55,900 per kilogram. A kilogram is 35.274 ounces. Lets lo with the $55,900 cost, and divide that by 35.274 = $1585 per ounce. Not sure exactly what goes into ASCI, whether it includes salaries and admin costs, but regardless, it is up about 9% or so, so Gold needs to stay above 1700 and preferably 1800 for a decent profit"
I have a strong feeling the stock will jump up about 5% in the after hours today
"I’m looking to buy more on any dip, maybe after gold reaches $1960. This will test the $15 level by the end of 2021, or sooner depending on when gold hits $2200."
Beautiful chart.The best amongst gold miners.double benefit from strong gold price and weak currency.
Short squeeze!!!
Seeking Alpha reports production in line w guidance however aisc increased. Buy the dip and be happy u did
"My guess is the market is predicting fed tightening ...bad for stocks, bad for gold short time."
"Gold going up yet HMY going down? Are all of the miners going down, or is this specific to HMY?"
big boys need this under $3.50 to kill lots of options. just buy and hold for free money.
Up over 7% today! Not bad. Let's see if we can build on that next week and get back above $4. A positive earnings announcement should take us closer to $5.
Every one knew non-farm payrolls would be higher this month as people get off unemployment benefits that come to an end on Sept 1. I don't think the workforce will improve much more though unless infrastructure bill passes. This will increase debt and should be good for gold. All this current and increasing inflation will benefit gold...
Harmony hit a high of $18.64 back in 2006 before the great recession of 2008!
come on
"Yeesh, 5th day in a row of selling off? I thought I got in at a good point on 7/22, is someone trying to scare off newcomers, or is there something I don't know about?"
Buy buy buy $4.00 coming!!!!!!!
"I am amazed at where the price is right now but it is a given there will be another stimulus. The only question is the size and when. The dollar will still go down and the price of gold will go up. Also volume has dropped off significantly these last few days, so I am not putting much stock in the continually downward price. I think this is a great buying opportunity and I would be willing to bet (actually I am betting significant amounts) that this will be back above 6.00 before this is all over."
CPI data is due out this week.
Time to take some profit and sell. Gold price will fluctuate and come down again.
"$.60 cents difference in stock price in three trading sessions...$4.35 to $3.75...retesting the recent low I guess. Not sure who would want to sell here. Its obvious US economy is not heading anywhere and inflation is here to stay. Interest rates are not going up for another couple years, if ever."
"TODAY: FROM THE MARKET REALIST ------>Harmony Gold (HMY) is trading at the lowest multiple among its peers at 2.6x. The company bought a mine from AngloGold in 2018 and funded the acquisition through shares. This equity issuance was the major reason for the stock’s underperformance in 2018. While it remains a higher-cost producer, its management is expecting the South African rand’s weakness to support its costs going forward. Higher gold prices and a weaker rand could also provide support for the company’s valuation."
I'm trying to figure out the elasticity (relationship) of HMY's stock price to gold prices:Does anyone know more about HMY's hedging strategy and what % of production is tied to that and how far ahead?
"I invested in HMY because it has more gold than most miners in the ground. Once gold goes higher, HMY will be valued correctly in space way high."

"Well whatever HMY is doing right now due to hedge funds, we already know the score. Hmy met its production goals as reported a few months ago. The stock is fairly valued right now between 4.80 and 6.10. If Gold can get up to 1870 or so, as is likely later this year, it may well fly to 2300 based on the technical outlook. They are playing the game here they always play. Take it down as far as possible, catch the bottom lying fruit, then take it back up, sell high, rinse and repeat. Now that I see how this game is played, I am going to be playing it along with them."
one of the best bargins in the market. in for 10k shares....lets goooooo!
"Bull flag still intact till 1448 breach. HMY 4 month support at 3.00. , we'll see if China pulls away further or not soon"
"Solid fundamentals last 1 year, chart little off over 3-5 year. Need to bring earnings up, still purchased at 3.01 and 2.92. Judging historical data I need to wait at least 6 months to see decent profits."
Lots of interest in HMY. Don't be tempted to jump to early.
"we are just closing some gaps left behind$3.66 will close the first gap, we were almost there today.another gap at 3.07-3.14 , now that's a nasty one.either way, once this downtrend exhaust itself, we may see some fireworks comes earnings. Reply"
"I think the stronger ZAR is weighing on the share price and I don't think they have any currency hedges in place at the moment. I'd have to do the math and look at the daily gold prices in the 2nd half to figure out whether the higher POG has outweighed the exchange rate, but i'm guessing the analysts have done it and it doesn't look too good."
"max out the chart back to 1994, the pos has been above 3 for 98% of the time over 24 years. With gold on the rise I'm still buying"
"Nice Pre. GDX up, POG up, CME Gold Futures up. DUST down.Follow the tracks you guys."
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 5.87% to 3.79
I'm beginning to think this was a bad investment.....is everyone else holding on to a sinking anchor and hoping it won't hit bottom.....not dishing the position just looking for some insight.
"What do you think of this? If we bounce off 1260 I think we will see 1400 (or close to it very soon). Otherwise, before year end will be trading near 1380 levels by the looks of things. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iip9fzOz/"
Advancing POG will make HMY a great buy for months to come. Opinion: Buy and hold for now.
Harmony Gold Mining Company is down 6.70% to 3.28
"758% increase in net profit and the share price lost almost 20% in a month and almost 5% premarket?!!! A big question mark yet, we keep hoping for a fair share price"
Might buy more at $2.5
Earning report at SEC dot gov.Harmony Gold earned $0.15 per share. Nicely profitable. HMY will be even more profitable at the level gold price is at now. They have a lot of assets and small debt. HMY could go over $2.50 per share.
"High volume this morning at the open. 1 million shares traded in just the first 10 minutes of trading, and now 4.4 million as of 10:35 am. This could be the capitulation we have been waiting for. If we can finish flat or positive, it could be a sign we probably hit bottom. I can't see stock going much lower..take a look at the 10 year chart and stock was trading in much higher ranges, in the $13-15 range between 2002-2008 when gold was $300-900 and ounce. The company has never been in as financially sound a position as it is today, with almost no debt and a gold price of $1800."
why didnt i sell this when it was 2.50!!???
I agree with Baba.Canadian gold companies had the lead yesterday.South African gold could take the baton today.
Today is a fantastic buying op. Make use of it. ;)
"Once again, my innocuous posts were deleted talking about hmy historical prices, that were informative imo. I have been searching for some good message boards out there and there are some that might cost a little but are far superior to Yahoo. Its a shame, Yahoo once had very good boards...i rank it as among the worst out there at this point and Yahoo will never get a dime from me for their financial information as a result."
"Great ER coming out soon, in the next few weeks. Guidance will be fantastic"
"Look at the 5-day, 1-month, 6-month, 1-year GDX, the 1-year POG chart and the CME gold futures. Throw in the slowing world economy just for fun...Now, give me one good reason not to be owning HMY...."
One of the few miners where Share price is divergent with gold price.
When do we find out about a declared dividend? Didn't HMY promise to pay 20% of its free cash flow to its shareholders?
"I have a feeling that if gold price hits 1300+ this share price is going to explode. Trump dumpster fire, shaky stock market and FUD - fear uncertainty doubt will cause a stampede to gold imo."
Gold up hmy down. Gold down hmy gets crushed 
good entry point!
"Added another 10k shares at 4.90, this is a buy now, feel bad for those that bought at the top. That Richard guy must have lost tons on it, he went from cheerleader to bullish. If you own it don’t sell it just ride the trough up to the next peaking wave. Gold will be 2300 year end."
this stock has est to earn .69 a share in 2021 and a book value of $3.41 with low debt
"Fwiw, David Paul, who is an experienced gold trader, says gold maystll go down to a fib level near 1720 or so but he thinks gold will push up to 2300, once all of the non believers are gone. On my end I will continue to hold hmy and if it does hit the fib level at 1720 or so, will buy more."
"Bought at 3.45. Guess I should have waited a few days. Well, story of my life. :("
I got in at $6.30...Should I worry?
"Bought at $5.75....a few days ago...so far bad purchase for me...been terrible....sell , buy more. Or just hang on,??? Any thoughts on this much appreciated ty"
"1780 was support. Now it's resistance. Gold has to fight to get back to 1830, more resistance, than needs to fight to get to 1870. Hmy shareholders watching and waiting."
may june july august big strong months for gold/ silver and other precious metals Mining shares will move up nicely $IAG$GSS $GORO $GAU $HMY $BTG $GOLD $EXK $NGD $EQX
Does anyone know when HMY will pay its next dividend?
"Only traders care about how a vacine might affect gold. INVESTORS know about monetary policy, bail-outs, interest rates, and continual money printing affecting it. HMY 18 by mid 2021."
PE under 6 $$$
Major Indices Down. Gold and Miners Up. The way it should be!
What’s going on in the markets with a potential trade war is only bullish for gold. I see a great opportunity now
Down 2 weeks HMY time for a rise. FED will not hike rates anytime soon. Inmfact more stimulus coming. Delta Variant growing stronger. HMY $4.00 then $5.50!
"I have posted the same question twice and twice my post has been removed. A fair question too, having to do with why the price of hmy was so much higher 10 years ago when price of gold so much lower. Yahoo I do not trust your people or your data so I will never pay a penny for your services. There is far better than you out there. Hire more quality people and maybe I would sign up for your financial data, but the trust is not there."
HOOLD 
ER out tomorrow before market open.
"Hold the line folks, or this is the opportune time to buy more. Take advantage of the hedge funds trying to drive this down, they will be covering soon enough."
Price is a steal now and ready to move up sharply in days. 10X from here soon! Star performing AlphaNorth Asset Management was LEAD INVESTOR in new private placement when shares were $.36 https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5606254
"The point is Buffet chose to hold a Gold mining stock, not a Gold or Gold stock. You know what is this meaning!?Long and hold HMY with Gold rush trend!!"
"Remember, all the investors buying the shares at these prices expect it to go up. Hang in there. This stock was $3.50+ on lower gold prices."
Looks like GLD and HMY are on the verge of breaking out in a big way. Would not be surprised to see 4$ within 2 weeks.
Bought 3100 shares
Options expiration might be playing a part in suppression of stock price..hard for them to keep HMY under $3.50. Lets see what happens later today...
"When I look at gold price chart in terms of south african rand, I can see that the price of gold has fallen 11% over the last one month, whereas the price in USD has appreciated 6%. That tells the whole story of HMY."
My NEM and other gold stocks are up decently. Why not my HMY? Hmmmm!
What is the result expected for Q 3 ?. All indicators tell us that the results must be better than in previews two ones. The new management have to show capabilities for running this company and paying dividends as they promised and said. Personally on current stock price I loose some small money but I trust to see a better future very soon.
HMY should be back above $4 once Gold hits $1800.
This stock usually mirrors the patterns of GFI and SBSW; lets see if Gold can bounce off $1851 this morning and mining stocks can reverse course.
I see a valuable company with its stock price suddenly beaten down. I am using this opportunity to build a position back down at the bargain price.
How come gold has not run on inflation news? I thought gold would go higher with inflation. Is it because they throw out the term “transitory”? Or am I incorrect about gold and inflation relationship?
Hmy may have unlimited upside and will keep going up till we have a real vaccine -
"Stochastics measured on a scale of 1 to 100. 80 is overbought and usually means a pullback. 20 is oversold and usually means a rally. Right now stochastics on a three month chart is about 4.75. About as low as I have ever seen it. But RT is still well below 1, so I still don't think this is a good buy for a trade at this price."

"Perhaps the problem with HMY is the increase in ASCI? ""The average gold price received during 2021 was $1,719 versus $1,461 in 2020. AISC for 2021 was $1,460 per ounce vs. $1,293 per ounce in 2020""."

I had been thinking that HMY - low priced as it was/is -- was like a perpetual gold option. What gives here?...can't even hold $3 with gold over 1500. Is it: Currency risk? .... Safety risk for how this company has operated?... Did they aggressively hedge their gold production at lower levels? ..... anyone actually have an idea?
"I have been following this closely and think we might actually repeat what we did June-July 2016 with a steep run-up to 4$ +. My original analysis indicated a 2$ price target however it seems that gld has held better than anticipated. With stocks this frothy a steep retrace in the coming month wouldn't be surprising together with a drop in the dollar. A combination of a stock correction, currency devaluation and a ~7-8% gld retrace could lead to the next leg up to the 1500-1600$ range. Gld seems poised to snap higher if it can break the downward channel, likewise a breakdown below would lead to a target of roughly 1360-1380 gld. Personally, it seems to me that we might break higher as GLD consolidates at the current level. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0SurZ4tE/"
"bought a thousand more shares at $2.83, eventually, this will be a winning trade. They can't rig this market forever"
Earnings report on Feb. 12
Sorry for the recent spam - are we forming a giant bull flag? https://www.tradingview.com/x/wnCvRi9o/
"Someone keeps feeding the ask with lots of shares; most likely some naked shorting coming in from Europe somewhere. This should end soon as buying will just outpace the selling. Just too good of a company with positive fundamentals to keep price at such a discount. Company will be debt free in coming months, and have positive free cash flow going forward on all gold sold above AISC of $1370. PERIOD, nothing negative one can say here. Hundreds of millions of USD in profits will come in this year and stock will have to rise..or it will just buy back its shares with the profits. 400 million share float x $4 a share right now...company could theoretically take itself private and roast those short f%^&*%&*&^ in the process."
"Every time Gold looks like it is about to break out, something or someone brings it back down. Really quite remarkable."
when there's blood in the streets... opinion poll: thumbs up -> buy down -> sell
"We won't know where Gold is going until Powell signals where the taping is going. If there is tapering, that will take Gold down, with the market. If no tapering for a while, hopefully Gold will be going up."
"Well on our way to 1690. If that doesn't hold, 1580. Too late to sell now imho."
"Might have got up from the table too soon, but sold st $4.10Will buy back on the next dip.Good luck and best wishes to you folks.~Dave"
"We are now trading at 52 week low, back when gold was at $1680 or so...this drop is unwarranted and ridiculous. Miners are making huge profits here with positive free cash flow. All in costs for HMY are around 1400 per ounce."
sGold up this wa down down 1% Gold down this is down 4 %Huge Manipulation for something big coming up and some one somehwere wants shares cheap. This week will be interesting. Any take ?
"Earnings, profits was solid, they growing and making money HMY $5+ or they will get bought out. Junior miner gets swallowed buy a major like Barrick, NEM"
"End of August I believe, but will there be any surprises? Unlikely. Technically Gold can still go down to 1780 or so but if it can manage to get above resistance around 1920 or so, it can get to 2300."
Harmony Gold Mining Company is up 6.81% to 4.08
"May have been amazing earnings but how is it being sold? Misses by .15 earnings, misses by 130 Million revenue"". That is the way the game is played."

"Although this relates to BEAR market funds and inverse ETFs, the technical indicator discussed in this article (the death cross) is very helpful for those of us who seek other safe havens, such as gold-related stocks. Give 'er a read. Would love to hear comments. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-dips-below-200-185803581.html?.tsrc=fin-srch"
gold will keep going up until the tariff with China is resolved and the talk of recession stops
Last yrs tax selling began in haste Tues Dec 4th with gold rising 6% in 3 wks. Tues Dec 3 may be trapdoor opening this yr. China wants trump defeated so I can't imagine they want to aid his cause w signing anything meaningful now after kicking it down the road for 18 months already. And it's all over 10% but China holds way better cards
“HMY is the superior value option right now.”https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hmy-aem-better-value-stock-154003783.html
Trump wants to devalue the dollar. Being tweeted right now. This will be rocket fuel for HMY
Just wondering how soon before they suspend mining operations due to COVID19
"Cheap prices for HMY given the current market conditions (0% interest & FED QE Infinity) & book value of ~4$. People throwing the baby out with the bathwater every time the market tanks. 25% undervalued at present value. Forward looking if GLD climbs higher it will shoot higher after breaking the ATH, could easily see a 2000$+ gold price by December 2020 imo. Accumulated some more today and will be adding given more opportunity!"
"Premarket at 1.91. If it comes down further, will start building a position."
"US retail sales will be down huge for July, when announced next week. Gold will be back above $1800 by Wednesday"
can somebody stop this manipulation?
"@Fencer, remember you back from the ego board a while back. Thinking of adding this. General question, which could save me some time researching...how much in gold reserveres does hmy have total ownership after jv's and is there anything ego/certej going on with the reserves where the reserves at a particular mine will nevet be dug up but is counted towards reserves? Any significant copper at all? Thanks in advance."
"I finally agree with Charles, selling now is selling to the Grifters, charlatans, manipulators and the rest of the Cesspool we call Wall Street. With the infrastructure bill, and then the additional democratic spending proposals of trillions, once again Gold will go up significantly, and HMY, after it has been stolen from from the hands of the naive, will again be heading to five and above. The last few months of the year should be good for Gold. Once the market collapses because they finally have to cut back on QE and all of the injection of money into the system, who knows what Gold will do. Hopefully I will be out of the market by then."
"Short interest has finally decreased a bit in the past two weeks by 1,460,000 shares! Even the shorts are covering at these levels. Everyone knows things will turn around."
Harmony Gold Mining reached a 52 Week high at 4.59
"Commercial gold hedge short protective bets under their long positions at historic lows. Very bullish , happened before 1924 high also. Called COT"
Looks like some of the reports were released today (looking very promising! ) : https://www.harmony.co.za/invest/reporting/fy19https://www.harmony.co.za/invest/company-announcements/2019/item/1019-investment-strategy-boosts-cash-flows
"My final word, I now understand why HMY is facing these headwinds. It was all discussed in the earnings call and can be read in the available transcripts. People for now are simply moving into shorter term plays. Its really that simple."
This is completely unfair
"HMY reduced its net debt by 75% last year. It has only 40 million USD of net debt left on its books, if I read correctly and will have no debt by later this year! Positive free cash flow as we move forward! Who else can give you these prospects? This is a screaming buy."
"One other thing I will note, that the stock has been falling in greater than average volume these last few days. 9.5 million shares traded. Given there are 600 million plus shares out there, that is not a lot, but still more than average. As they say, volume is conviction....I am guessing some weak hands have been selling. No choice though but to hold even through another down day....4.5% so far."
Mining weekly has a great interview with the CEO excellent
I think gold will go over $2000 an ounce fairly soon with all the printing of money ... but on a side noteAnyone else here because this company shares the name of the production company that made a childhood cartoon in the 80s? Just curious...I bought in years ago at $1.70 out of nostalgia and haven’t let go of this stock
"The only thing going for Gold right now is Basel 3. Some ""experts"" think this will drive the cost of Gold up to 2100 by the end of the year, Bank of America just said they believe the effect will be neutral. Otherwise inflation goes up, Gold goes down. Stock market goes up, Gold goes down. Stock market goes down, gold goes down. inflation goes down gold goes down. Bitcoin goes up gold goes down. Bitcoin goes down Gold goes down. The only reason it seems that anybody would buy gold is because the end of the world is coming, but then what do you need gold for? Am I pessimistic about holding HMY? Yes. Do I think HMY is a great company? Yes. Do I think it matters? No, apparently not. Maybe somebody will buy the company out."
https://discord.gg/gRvEZajGny
"Unless the earnings report is disappointing, that 24 million share short position will have to cover soon. There could be a huge spike up next week if earnings are good and gold keeps rising back towards $2000."
"Gold is an obstacle to the complete control of societies, which is why the elite are doing their best to discourage us from this metal."
Just bought 1500 shares
"2 M shares traded by 10 AM , volume often precedes price"
"$hmy underpacing gold yet again steal of a buy. Dividend 3.8%, earnings whopping 60¢/share, just paid off half its debt, only $38m USD debt left.17% undervalued, that is 17% lower than last time gold was at current price. $au $gold $nem $fnv"
Guidance raised. Production much higher for 2021 and being raised for 2022
"Hmy is way overpriced. Way exceeding twice the % rise in the price of gold as normal for gold miners. It's priced for gold to be over $2,000/oz. All downside risk now."
Higher highs with higher lows last 3 days in a row sets a trend as the pros speak. Next week gold may get alot more activity after clearing 2nd resistance
should've closed above 4 dollars this week
I will buy under 2.00
manipulated 100%
Add when you can... any bad news will have these gold miners stocks running again. IAG & EGO have pulled back too. Keep stacking when you can!
"I’m sure I’ll keep buying up more stocks. However, in this Paradigm shifts situations, all of investors have to have a Gold in the portfolio like a Dalio, Buffet and others.https://economicprinciples.org/downloads/Paradigm-Shifts.pdf"
GOLD going to $1600 you best believe that
We are at the cusp of a huge PM rally for a good reason.
Seems many are unsure as to when this will breach 1400 (including myself). Was playing around with some charts and came up with this https://ibb.co/V3ktzJh What do you all think - 1400 before or after 2019? :) I am optimistic about this trend playing out faster than shown in this chart but fully anticipate a retracement to 1250-1260 levels before making a crack at the 1400 level. Thoughts?
$3.00 next stop for hmy
congrats to those still holding
$HMY (key resistance level & volume booming)Currently sitting at 3.65 with lots of volume coming in. Excited for today's PM session; waiting for the rebound to $4.
"Unfortunately, due to HMY reducing its guidelines for production over the next year, I calculated about a 17% reduction in revenue for the year, without which we would likely be well above $6.00 per share right now. This will eventually work out, but it sure is hurting the stock right now."
A short attack is underway here with this stock just as there is with a few other miners. What are they trying to prove?
AISC is around $1400 an ounce for HMY; It has been making about $400-450 an ounce of positive free cash flow per ounce of gold mined for the past quarter. Stock should be much much higher.
"Feds will raise interest rates inflation too hot, gas $3.50 gal. and cpnsumer goods prices too high, gold will setback below $1700 very son then HMY $2.00 under! sell!!"
"The more money the FED prints out of thin air, the harder the market can crash and the higher silver and gold will go up"
Got in at 1.95 this morning...haven't owned a South African Miner since I owned DROOY before Y2K.
"Gentlemen: I observe this: In Au 2007 Gold was trading around $670 an oz; HMY about $13 a share. October 2018 Gold is around $1,200 an oz and HMY about $2.10 a share. There must be some fundamental item with this company -- what is it? ...anyone know who has been following it for a long time?"
It was me buying but someone has been busy!
Let me speculate. Somebody is accumulating HMY shares as cheaply as possible because it intends to buy the company out? Maybe they are in negotiations right now? Why has HMY not declared a dividend besides all of its cash flow?
Is this company losing money and I am wasting my money and time or should i buy more to bring the average down please? Thanks.Total Revenue 1.96BEarnings from Continuing Operations -104.7KNet Income -56.04M
PE below 5 placing my order now. Lol buy the dip or regret it for life.
"hold on to your hats boys and girls , cause if you see what i see in the charts , this stock is about to go on a rocket ride up"
I highly recommend watching the Michael Gentile interview with Kitco from two days ago. It is very telling for where Gold may be going in the future.
"This has been my worst stock selection in a very long time. I was thinking that with all of the new stimulus coming, never ending Fed QE, that the dollar would be dropping...and this was almost a sure thing. And yet...I still am hopeful..not selling yet, but I am getting very concerned that I may end up having to hold far longer than I intended."
"One other thing, because the Stock is now trading below $5.00, I'm assuming a number of institutions had to sell. Perhaps it would be a good idea if HMY did a reverse stock split, say 1-4, reducing the float and increasing the price."
"so, why the nose dive the last 2 weeks?"
"I have no doubt HMY will get back on the rise, most of the negative comments here are not trustworthy. I see this stock going to $10 in a month or so. Gold is hitting all time high and thats a good reason to invest in gold mining companies. Best of luck"
AMAZING Earnings!!!! Just looked on website. We should be over $4 right now....
"Guess everyone wants a piece of the pie. It's okay....PNG could mine it themselves...SYDNEY (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea wants to keep 40% of gold produced from the proposed Wafi-Golpu project, the country's commerce minister said, creating a potential hurdle to an agreement with co-owners Newcrest Mining and Harmony Gold."
Ouch... 52 week low... and the bad months are still ahead.
"Harmony Gold Mining : U.S, allies propose financing for power plant for Papua New Guinea gold minehttps://www.marketscreener.com/HARMONY-GOLD-MINING-COMPA-1413368/news/Harmony-Gold-Mining-U-S-allies-propose-financing-for-power-plant-for-Papua-New-Guinea-gold-mine-28541595/"
I like HMY out of all the other gold related stocks. Sales last year were over a billion and the stock value is closer to $11. I have 1k shares but new month is coming...will add more on the dips.
"Don’t against the FED! Last time low interest rate at 10 years ago, Gold price was historically high and HMY was $20. Now, FED officially announced at this weekend which is zero interest rate with 5 years or longer even inflation rate hit 2%. That is suggesting HMY going to higher than $20 in sometime.Again, don’t against the FED that’s the simple rule of make money on the market!"
HMY is coming on strong. Up 15% in the past 3 weeks. Formed a nice base and is rising. HMY is still very undervalued.
"Shorts might be in trouble tomorrow! Looks like we are going higher, unless the FED opens its mouth. Job numbers should be bad."
$FNV Just bought discounted down 5% past 5 days with gold & silver up. $AU $GOLD $HMY $NEM
HMY is the best performer among the miners
"A lot of people wondering why this stock (and other gold miners) has been selling off over the last few days.Technical investors flagged gold miners as being overbought based on the charts and there was a very high chance of a downward correction. That said, it did not predict the extent of the correction. The article also pointed out that the fundamentals (a weak dollar, high gold prices, and a stock market poised to fall) all seemed to indicate long-term strength for gold.The takeaway was this.... gold miners may fall this week. If you are a short term investor then you will take some lumps on this. If you can stomach holding onto the stocks for awhile then you can most likely ride out this fall for a week or two then get a nice uptrend back to all-time highs. Gold miners have largely structured their operations to make profit above the $1500/ounce price line since that is where gold has been hanging out for awhile now. With the new costs associated with Covid it has pushed the mining costs to about $1600-1650/ounce. At current prices that is going to most likely mean profit boosts of several hundred percent for the big miners for Q2 and especially Q3 and onwards.So, if you are a technical or short-term investor then jump ship now. If you are more of a long-term person then hold on and wait. Pretty simple."
"Warren Bufffet bought Gold shares, I hope this will bring traders into gold stocks"
If we bounce from here we are most likely going to be breaking out of this giant bull flag higher ^^^ https://www.tradingview.com/x/AnY9EJ5W/
^^^Got IN under 3-00....Know I didnt make a Mistake
"What's going on? Guesses? Not selling but it sure seems like somebody is manipulating here, somehow."
"Only the price of gold is holding the pps of HMY, otherwise this is a $2.50 stock. Either buying or shorting HMY at this price has the same risk, price can move either way"
So glad I bought into this albeit at around $2.15.
I’m not a chart expert at all but it looks like a bull flag is forming on the 3 month chart
Premarket-Joke: Somebody sells in 100-shares-steps. Heavy manipulated. Don't give up. This is manipulation!
"Have to admit, I bought DUST as a reverse ETF arbitrage move Friday afternoon. The POG has been advancing maybe a little ""too nicely"" these past two weeks. Also noticed that the short % has been increasing in most miners since December. I want to stay positive on gold and especially HMY. Just couldn't help but buy a little insurance though. ~ Go Patriots!"
What’s happening here? Some political issues in Papua Guinea??? Don’t understand why is so oversold…..
Gold slowly going back up...but hmy seems dead.
"Just noticed DXY 1985 peak is inline w 2002 to present peaks as resistance, crazy chart for gold bulls. Was 152. 35 yrs ago... it could be the end of strong dollar hurting gold price"
can anyone tell me what that green number means next to HMY's ticker symbol on the Yahoo page? 8>)
I think this is looking bullish. If there is any weakness I am adding.
4.54 when gold was 1680. Gold is 1750 now. Goldman Sachs says it's going to 2750 by year end due to very low interest rate returns. Earnings are just getting better for hmy. ￼￼￼￼ I think we mlght see $8 by yr end or an acquisition.
"gold @ 1.218,00 hmy losing money mining, how long can they stay afloat? feel free to share thoughts :("
"Keep in mind that HMY has reset after its earnings report. Pre-earnings, with gold flirting with 1800, HMY would be about 4.30 and if gold hit 1900, would be over 5 on its way to 6. So for whatever reason, hmy has been devalued by the market, likely due to rising production costs imho."
"Wafi-Golpu got its environmental permits signed 2 weeks ago. New Guinea needs the cash cow now. The mine will produce 450,000 ounces annually solely owned and operated by Harmony. Goto webpage for info."
The gap from last week has been closed....time to buy again.
This will be up next week to catchup the GOLD price. And now that GOLD has kicked off the momentum will keep going in Sept. We probably will very likely see 5 by EOM
Hefty climb in HMY today. People realizing it is undervalued. A 9% rise in stock price. An undervalued gold mine.
wow down 6 days row shorts and longs you have to wonder! lmaoa $3.50+ next few days!! hmy $5.00 very soon!
Shocking similarity in GLD consolidation with Feb-May 2019. Think we may be primed for a breakout in the next 1-2 weeks. https://www.tradingview.com/x/mZkyGhaw/
Long slog back above 1900 and then 2000. Should just not pay attention.
"The trade war being started by Trump will be very helpful for gold prices. Dollar will start falling, time to buy gold is now."
With 250 T of debt in the world and growing daily there's only 10 T of gold. Kitco believes a 50% increase in gold price to 2250 could happen bringing 15T as debt soars as a balance. Trading channel to 1620 next...
"Well we are still at a crossroads.. do we break up or do we break down? And how much will the Jackson Hole conference at the end of the month impact us? Goldman still says Gold 2000 and China is buying more Gold, so I am betting on Up. I suppose all longs are."
"Double the volume on a big up day for actual metals...this down...USA fraud, worst cancer in the world hedegefunds live there.God does not exist I think...hahaa"
"HMY traded down to $3.75 for a few days between Feb 17th and March 3rd, when gold had its last drop to 1685. Whats interesting is the HMY was down to the high 3's when Gold was at the same price as today, 1775-1785. It actually gained in value as gold dropped to lower temporarily before bouncing back. I think the same will happen. Maybe a little more pain and then a very strong rise back to $5-6 in the coming weeks. Earnings will be better as gold has been strong the past few months. I don't see any negatives, unless there is some political situation we are not aware of yet."
Will be buying at $3
"This is really bargain price now by short period trend since last week. However, gold is still long trend to $2,300 ~$5,000 by analysts. When gold up HMY up more."
4% down in an hour.
"The problem now is traders are buying hmy at lower lows and selling at lower highs. Can't blame them, but that is going to make it more difficult to break through resistance."
When are earnings due out?

But I'm guessing they have taken out a lot of stops.
Remember the earnings are tomorrow after market close. What are your views about last quarter earning?
Where is the bottom? Perhaps 1.56 imo which is the 12 month low. I think this is a high quality company and should recover given enough time. GLTA

"Fear & panic causing a sell off in every asset: BTC - GLD - SLV - Stocks - this happened in 2008, 2000 due to margin calls & a liquidation of hedges for cash. However, following both 2000 & 2008 Gld saw positive movement as a response to the FED's actions. FED printing ludicrous amounts of money / dropping rates / helicopter money / bail outs etc. This will continue. Following a sell of GLD will be back with massive upside as that cash on the sidelines looks for new opportunities. My thoughts on the current situation - am I wrong? Thoughts? :) Definitely a painful time for any investor."

"Looks like this stock is going to under preform today. I suggest purchasing a few more shares as this will rise. Covid relief is no where near over, the fed is pumping unfathomable amounts of dollars into the market artificially boosting stock prices. Its basic economics you cant just create all of this money and never pay it off. And the US can never pay off their debt, it would be impossible. The fed can never increase rates now without taxing Americans more than they already are. People can barely afford the taxes now, if the fed increased rates it would kill the middle and lower classes."
