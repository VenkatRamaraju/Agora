"Beautiful break out today, in the worst possible market. Unappreciated company."
Well I've been here for almost a month now. I've searched everywhere but there are no investors. It's just me. I learned how to make a fire with sticks. I made a crude spear and have learned how to skewer fish in the shallows. Wish I could send a telegram.

Still no one checking in. This is really funny.
"This company has the worst management. The reason is that they are clueless about customer service. The wait time if you try to reach them has gone beyond 30 minutes and counting. Try email and the website link doesn't work for customer service. Try to chat and the chat person from their company doesn't respond!!! How can a customer focused company have the worst customer service. They need new management who ""gets customer service"" and this company will excel."
Will WU be next to partner with a crypto and reduce costs for money transfers? Why not?
Just use bitcoin. No point in WU anymore
"You guys must use the wrong Moneygram or something. $MGI is way cheaper than $WUCalculated on June 24, 2020:.MGI: 500 CAD is equal to 284 pounds with $5 fee.WU : 500 CAD is equal to 272 pounds with minimum $7 -up too $15 fee. So if one went with WU you would lose on $12 pounds ($21) and spend 2-7 more on fees for the same $500 CAD. Meaning for every 500 CAD sent to UK, you save $23-30 sending through MGI rather than WU. mgi is KING."
WU is up 5.24% to 21.68

"#Western Union Company ($WU) looking good for higher prices. #StochasticOscillator and #RSI go green, according to stoxline."
interesting in the new financial report Western Union has set aside 2 and 1/2 to 3 billion dollars for acquisition.. they need to get this done it is important for both of their survival$mgi very important hint from $wu 2Q financial report “Anticipate approximately $2.5 – $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases (if no significant M&A” Allocation Priorities1)M&A 2)Repurchases very strong signal that @WesternUnion is acquiring @MoneyGram
WU is up 4.99% to 26.31
Will be looking at how these numbers compare to MGI. Notice the comment about digital. Would be nice to get one of these upgrades this week.Western Union +2% after BofA points to upside https://seekingalpha.com/news/3614037?source=ansh $WU
"""They’re trying to purchase their own growth because the organic revenue growth in the business has been negligible for ten years. If you add acquisitions into capex and subtract out cash made from divestitures to get your total capex number for a given year, and you do this for ten years, you will see that Western Union has spent $1.58B in capex. Depreciation still cost them $2.51B. They are rotting faster than they are growing.""https://nclbreports.substack.com/p/western-union-wuDon't be an ant walking north while on the back on an elephant walking south."
WU reached a 52 Week high at 25.68
Yeah it's cheap but it deserves that valuation. https://nclbreports.substack.com/p/western-union-wu
"If you see consumer pricing for MGI and then look at Western Union differences of over 10x are being seen. MoneyGram has won, they adopted. Its over for WU, I would sell now and ride mgi's climb to $20. Make fun of me now. Let's check back this time next year?"
WU is down 7.19% to 26.21
WU is up 5.98% to 18.78
comparing $MGI to $WU on many metrics price should be at least $21-28/sh for Moneygram. That's how undervalued this company is. But you already knew that.
western union offers to buy money gram

Happy Thanksgiving telegram to me.
"Needs an updated business model, “Fresh” name (something that does not scream “old person”)and digital payment system for customers all over the world to use whenever they wish, not just at their physical locations- which people can only send and receive $. How old school and way outdated! Goodbye and goodnight WU Hello HUMBL"
WU is up 4.94% to 23.50
WU heading back to $16 or below! More bad news! SELL ASAP!!!
Anyone there? Knock knock.
"Few more for you:1) $WU is shopping, looking to acquire weaker rivals, with a goal of a) synergy & b) digital strategy2) Last time (2015?) there was a rumor of a buyout by $WU, and they quickly came out with a denial, not this time though."
"Shorts have always been active on this stock for as long as I can remember. I strictly remember being ridiculed and disliked for comments like "" I am buying more every 5 cents it goes bellow 2.3"" . This doesn't make shorts dumb, they have their own interests we have ours. But this isn't the stock to short unfortunately (for them;) . Like I said may 13, 2019 'longs, history will show we are making the right decision'. Today I can happily say it has. Furthermore, today September 15, I can say same thing why don't we talk about this in February? As for now, like my other stocks I am going to go ghost on this account and will only answer questions from the new people getting in. For the rest of you- ignore the bs-.P.S read this post from another thread, if you still want and see why I am so confident: TWO years ago $MGI was at $17! There is nothing to say that it won't easily get there by the end of the year! Remember, $MGI revenue ($1.4B) $WU revenue ($5.6B). $MGI is 25% of $WU. Market cap $MGI $0.29B and $WU $9.5B today. That means that $MGI is generating 25% of $WU revenue but is only 3% of the market cap! Hmmmm......With $50M from Ripple, efficiencies in non-VisaDirect payments from $XRP.X, 1st to go live with Visa-Direct.....Can anyone tell me why $MGI would not be able to pay off the remainder of their debt AND continue to grow? Even if their Market cap is 25% of $WU that would make them a $2.3B company with a stock price of $49!BTW, MGI transaction prices are current;y 500% CHEAPER THEN WESTERN UNION. NOW YOU TELL ME.Peace out."
Western union is a solid play along with CVS
18$ here we come
"Any reason why this isnt a good stock to keep long term, wu is everywhere and you can use online and offline. Transactions are better for me atleast when i want to send money. And they so charitable work"
If you guys have WU you guys should look into tsnp Thank me later
I thought it would be up more pre market
This train leaving for $12
"WU is not undervalued. The stock is wallowing around just like the company itself. It is a company waiting for another company to buy them for the Western Union brand name. The underlying IT systems are a mess (think British Airways IT fiasco mess) because Leadership is just trying to milk the brand to scrape by and not really invest in the tools/systems it would need to become a growth company. There is no executive there that has the skill set necessary to really build the company (this includes the CEO, COO/CIO; CFO & Chief Compliance O) . The company culture is cancerous - people are discouraged from ""telling truth to power"" (even when it comes to items as benign as project statuses), and are HIGHLY rewarded for telling the executives what they want to hear while obfuscating the truth. Its not a growth company. Only 'Buy' if you think the company that ends up buying WU will offer a premium for the Western Union brand (because everything else -systems and leadership - will have to scraped). Given the new, and true, FinTech companies out there, there is no reason a buying company should offer a premium price."
The Western Union is up 6.10% to 23.83

"Upgrade today, Guggenheim. Buy. This company underappreciated."
Oh oh.Is todays reaction saying something about earnings next week?Is bad news coming? I was going to buy some but now I am a little leary. Maybe I should wait until after earnings annoucement.
what if trump were to shut down all money transfers to Mexico. what would that do to WU? What if he added China and other countries to a possible 'do not transfer money' list?
"If WU incorporates XRP the global remittance market will grow exponentially due to lower friction & settlement costs.People will send money overs seas because it will fast and cheap, not because they have to which is the case now."

Your CEO has the vision to go to Beverly hills real estate auction and offer a final bid of 90 % below the market value. Sadly WU is the SEARS of the industry and because of it's old business model NO one will buy it either
MGI way better!This is an old co behind the curve!Short it to $15

Headed up! #MGI #SQ #WU
What is with this stock? Every time it makes a nice move upward it gets pounded back down. Seems to want to go higher but just can't.
"WU is on its way out. If there’s any luck it’ll be acquired by a larger crypto player, for its network of vendors. The cost of Sending crypto is like 90% what are you thoughts?"
Sell this #$%$
"Even with the settlement, WU is still one of the largest sources of illegal immigrant funding, money for people trafficking, and drug running sites on the net. And everybody knows it."

"Yes, PayPal may be convenient, not to mention slow and VERY pricey, in order to use your OWN money. Western Union has become ancient along with Moneygram.HUMBL (TSNP) is the digital wallet and several other desired platforms all in one. Whether investors in PayPal, Western Union, Moneygram, etc. want to believe it or not, HUMBL really is the future. I’m not waiting until HUMBL’s stock price escalates to get in. Just think about it, wouldn’t it have been great to get in on the ground floor of PayPal? Very few did. Here is our chance to do that with HUMBL (TSNP). Can’t wait for the new ticker “HMBL”. Investors (the young at first) will flock to this phenomenal company. My generation will need to learn quickly about this technology that HUMBL is packaging for the population. Can’t wait for the new ticker “HMBL”, which will be replacing the “TSNP” ticker in just a few weeks. What an opportunity."
Its been a steady Eddy for me
Very little reaction to the BIG deal with Amazon: $1 billion estimated revenue opportunity for a company with $5.6 billion in revenues sounds like a lot to me. Under the radar?

"I'll never do business with WU again. Sent a friend $400 this a.m. What an overpriced lame service. Will use Walmart next time for only 8 bucks. My friend had truck troubles and is traveling. So I sent the funds and the site tells you that they can pick up anywhere in the US, footnote6. My friend shows her DL and provides the tracking number and the agent would not release funds. So I call WU and get someone with very poor English. So lame and so expensive. Walmart is only 8 buck so I'm told."
This company keeps on chugging trying to carve out the bits that work. I bought into it as a small investor frankly becauseI thought it could be a BO.
Get MoneyGram (MGI) instead.
Anybody in here? Thinking I may short at this level.
Does anyone know if it will be good or bad for $MGI or $WU is more countries start regulating cryptocurrencies like Turkey and China are doing?

Anymore talk of WU buying out MGI? Seemed like just a rumor!
better get with xrp before moneygram takes our lunch

"bitcoin and other cryptos are gonna kill Western Union business, times are changing"
"this whole move by $wu into $mgi play turf at $wmt is a classic move by an acquirer pushing the target to accept their terms. It's a fake, they are not gonna make any money on it. And Alex won't buckle, they will out compete $WU. Seen this many times on other M&A. Almost never works and the acquirer will have to pay fare market price + premium.Cmon Ersek, announce your move already, Alex called your bluff."
RIPPLE IS KING

SELL. The case is in the fundamentals. There's increasing competition in the financial payments market. Lots of small companies have entered the space and margins must be hurting. All you have to do is observe. Immigrants who send money overseas have MANY MORE options today than 5 years ago and those options tend to be cheaper. Same trends are hurting AXP too.
better switch to moneygram. ripple/xrp crypto will take over the world
Once the day traders SELL off from $19.20 WU will plummet back below $19.20!!! SELL ASAP!!!

"we are crushing any new fintech in terms of revenues and soon in EPS, and growing fast. Alex frustrated with sell side analysts for not recognizing the progress that company has made so far and given facts that those same analysts give competitors much higher multiples despite their growth slowing and moneygram's accelerating, think they miss the fact that prey becomes a predator and can not only fight back but to take their projected digital share.for a comparison, $MGI trades at 4.5 multiple to EBIDTA, has $815M debt$WU trades at 7. multiple to EBIDTA, has $4B in debt.$WISE trades at x23 multiple to revenue, 0 debt?$remitly has $5B valuation (could not find their metrics)Global money transfer market is $600B estimated, plenty of room for MGI to grow their digital business as 60-70% of that market is still legacy walk in."

Bitcoin will wash western union and money gram off the face of the earth. The poor will finally be able to transfer money to their loved ones with ease and not get charge outrageous prices to do so. No more driving and wasting your valuable time to get hosed from WU or money gram. Easy transfer that takes seconds and costs hardly anything with bitcoin. Take your losses now baggies. Get out and use your L you just took and invest in bitcoin. Make them gains back.
I would not be surprised if Ersek / $WU would go after $MGI again. buying it would be much better value than repurchasing shares / paying dividends imho.
