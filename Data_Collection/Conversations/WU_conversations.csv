Just bought my first lot here @18.35. I disagree with the narrative that stablecoins or FB will kill the business. There are strong regulatory barriers in this sector and these will be extended to crypto. The Leviathan/state will criminalize any free competition.
"You ask Why does WU keep selling off? Well there is the inconvenient fact that during this iteration of WU's existence (IPO took place 15 plus years ago), stock price has gone up about 4 percent, while the general S and P 500 has gone up about 370 percent. And that there is absolutely NOTHING in current plans to break this trend. So yeah, I can't see why selling off, but I can see why don't want to buy into."
Treat WU as a utility and keep collecting dividends until you get your sell price.
The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine. Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful only do occasionally
"we are crushing any new fintech in terms of revenues and soon in EPS, and growing fast. Alex frustrated with sell side analysts for not recognizing the progress that company has made so far and given facts that those same analysts give competitors much higher multiples despite their growth slowing and moneygram's accelerating, think they miss the fact that prey becomes a predator and can not only fight back but to take their projected digital share.for a comparison, $MGI trades at 4.5 multiple to EBIDTA, has $815M debt$WU trades at 7. multiple to EBIDTA, has $4B in debt.$WISE trades at x23 multiple to revenue, 0 debt?$remitly has $5B valuation (could not find their metrics)Global money transfer market is $600B estimated, plenty of room for MGI to grow their digital business as 60-70% of that market is still legacy walk in."
Bitcoin will wash western union and money gram off the face of the earth. The poor will finally be able to transfer money to their loved ones with ease and not get charge outrageous prices to do so. No more driving and wasting your valuable time to get hosed from WU or money gram. Easy transfer that takes seconds and costs hardly anything with bitcoin. Take your losses now baggies. Get out and use your L you just took and invest in bitcoin. Make them gains back.
Best candidate for quick short......
"Shorts have always been active on this stock for as long as I can remember. I strictly remember being ridiculed and disliked for comments like "" I am buying more every 5 cents it goes bellow 2.3"" . This doesn't make shorts dumb, they have their own interests we have ours. But this isn't the stock to short unfortunately (for them;) . Like I said may 13, 2019 'longs, history will show we are making the right decision'. Today I can happily say it has. Furthermore, today September 15, I can say same thing why don't we talk about this in February? As for now, like my other stocks I am going to go ghost on this account and will only answer questions from the new people getting in. For the rest of you- ignore the bs-.P.S read this post from another thread, if you still want and see why I am so confident: TWO years ago $MGI was at $17! There is nothing to say that it won't easily get there by the end of the year! Remember, $MGI revenue ($1.4B) $WU revenue ($5.6B). $MGI is 25% of $WU. Market cap $MGI $0.29B and $WU $9.5B today. That means that $MGI is generating 25% of $WU revenue but is only 3% of the market cap! Hmmmm......With $50M from Ripple, efficiencies in non-VisaDirect payments from $XRP.X, 1st to go live with Visa-Direct.....Can anyone tell me why $MGI would not be able to pay off the remainder of their debt AND continue to grow? Even if their Market cap is 25% of $WU that would make them a $2.3B company with a stock price of $49!BTW, MGI transaction prices are current;y 500% CHEAPER THEN WESTERN UNION. NOW YOU TELL ME.Peace out."
interesting in the new financial report Western Union has set aside 2 and 1/2 to 3 billion dollars for acquisition.. they need to get this done it is important for both of their survival$mgi very important hint from $wu 2Q financial report “Anticipate approximately $2.5 – $3 billion in dividends and share repurchases (if no significant M&A” Allocation Priorities1)M&A 2)Repurchases very strong signal that @WesternUnion is acquiring @MoneyGram
"Why does WU keep selling off? Exceptional yield, conservative payout ratio, low PE. What gives?"
"Facebook pressured to drop Novi crypto wallet project by SenatorsOCTOBER 20, 2021 BY PARTH DUBEYIn a letter, the US banking committee Senators have vehemently opposed the revival of the stablecoin and wallet project of the world’s leading social media platform, Facebook.Just a few hours had passed after Facebook’s launch of a pilot version in collaboration with a leading crypto exchange, Coinbase when Senators started handing in a letter of disapproval. There were around 5 Senators voicing their concerns regarding Facebook’s revival of its blockchain-based project.In a letter, one of the five Senators, Elizabeth Warren, raised her concerns. She is known for her skepticism about crypto and wrote,“Given the scope of the scandals surrounding your company, we write to voice our strongest opposition to Facebook’s revived effort to launch a cryptocurrency and digital wallet, now branded ‘Diem’ and ‘Novi,’ respectively.”Elizabeth Warren’s letterFacebook looking to revive the stablecoin and wallet projectFacebook had decided to launch a stablecoin termed Libra which failed and is now rebranded as the Diem token. The plan for the release of this project saw a lot of hurdles and remarks from a majority of regulators for the past couple of years.It seems that rebranding the project didn’t have any effect on the financial authorities, as they continue to remain dubious of Facebook’s activities and the crypto industry as a whole.According to the social media giant, the goal of the wallet is to hold the yet-to-be-released Diem token as well as other stablecoins. The wallet was tested in Guatemala and the US on 19th October in collaboration with Coinbase. The social media platform could learn about the efficiency and demand of their wallet through this testing process.Senators against the social media giantThere were 5 Senators who co-signed the letter, including Tina Smith, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz, Sherrod Brown, and Elizabeth Warren.“Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient.”The Senators claimed in the letterOn the other hand, the social media giant’s partner in the project, Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong came out in support of David Marcus, the leader of the entire project."
"SCARYSCARY CRASHBELOW $8 BY 2022 WUU IS OLD OLD MONEY TOO LATE TO CHANGE THEY NOT ADAPTING AND CHANGING WITH TODAY TIME , CRYPTO IS THE FUTURE OF MONEY TRANSACTION GAME GAME OVER FOR WUU"

You can now send BTC remittances instantly with the lightning network over Twitter anywhere in the world for pennies. WU= 
"So this company is pretty much dead right?! You guys realise that correct? Because this company is like the boomer generation, they got fat and rich off the poor but now they’re going extinct! I don’t think anyone cares either."
"Few more for you:1) $WU is shopping, looking to acquire weaker rivals, with a goal of a) synergy & b) digital strategy2) Last time (2015?) there was a rumor of a buyout by $WU, and they quickly came out with a denial, not this time though."

Facebook just landed the first salvo that will sink WU. The ability to send a regulated US $ stablecoin anywhere in the world will make WU's remittance business completely obsolete.
Yes all the common folks and immigrants who use WU to send their relatives and friends money are all set to use bit coin
