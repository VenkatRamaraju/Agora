"450 shares at 27,9. Friday gonna be a good day"
"This is the great thing about ""corporate speak"" ... when the CEO and SVPs get fired for malfeasance ... it is called a ""Leadership Transition""."
Please stop with the FIRST ENERGY METAL comments!!!This is First Energy Corporation!!!! A power generation and transmission company!!!
"AEP, if you’re listening, please buy out FE at $60/share !!! Please! You need to do it!!"
FE is in desperate need to restore investor confidence. I'm sure Mr. Strah is a good man but he is part of the old guard. It's time for an outsider with a great track record to clean house and restore confidence. This company and it's shareholders can't afford to wait! Things will probably get considerably worse if major moves aren't acted upon now!
Are they going to pay dividends? I can't find any info on a date.
"Ok, who knows what???"
New high
FE sold the entity in question in 2016. CEO said the subpoena is no issue. Back to $40 next week!
Break though $45 pps.........to the moon.....keep raising divvy to shake out the shorts......45c/divvy.....
"10 Cent Divdend Increase coming. 15% Electric Demand in July largest demand since Summer of 1977,"
Who loaded up at least 20% of their bankroll on this for $28????
Would love to see 29 again. Could I dare ask for 30 this week?
As in previous years FE Dividend Announcement will be out in December. They'll most likely be raising to .42. given the good financials of the past year one of the best.
"A quote from Warren Buffet:Almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been decent, likable and intelligent. Nevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money or business matters. It simply was not their game.”"
This is over sold. Should be in the 30s now then back to 40 after resolving these issues
"This is a political disaster, not a financial one. Political bad boys have a hard time justifying a dividend. Political bad boys must be punished, maybe to the point of selling the company. So who will be the white knight, who will then roll FE earnings into their own dividend calculation. Stay tuned folks, this may be fun."
"High demand on Lithium and $FE is just on time. Gurminder Sangha, CEO of First Energy Metals stated that, ""The first drill hole at Augustus Prospect exceeded our expectations in terms of width of the lithium zone which was reported over six metres in historical drill hole near this location. We are very excited about having a wide lithium pegmatite near surface."""
Same thing happened with Excelon with bribary and EXC quickly came back. They ended un paying a 200M$ fine. In Exelon's case the subsidiary involved is still part of the company compared to FirstEnergy. So the latter might end up with less issues according to analysts as they didn't have any incentive (bribary happenened after the split 2018 vs 2019).
"Keybanc's upgrade today to ""overweight"" (price target of 42) has been well received."
"I see lot of panic seller right now, give it another 20 mins, dust will settle down to go north $26++"
I could be terribly wrong.....but I am a buyer.
"Excited about $FE.CN , Everything seems to be pointing in the right direction."
"Great earnings, great guidance, CEO believes that company's support to Ohio's bill was ethical.Price should hit $30 on Friday."
"Great news! The My Animo stock portfolio is adding FE tomorrow (Aug 2)! They're up 54% annualized for 2021, so this is great news for FE stockholders! https://youtu.be/gh2ElTgPZb8"
Upgrade coming even with pending issues
I don't see how upper management will get out from under this chaos unless they bring innew reliable CEO to clean it up.
"All of you are safe to invest. It's a great Company with fantastic employees and they carry the weight. Given that Chuck is gone and his great golfing buddy Dennis is gone, it's upward from here. Steve Strah is extremely capable of getting through this. I know all the characters personally."
Even if FE pays 69 million back it takes in 1 billion + a quarter. Even if the state wants the 69 million back. It still leaves the state with 3 mouth balled NUKE Plants. Which they don't want. The Class Action is not any reason why this should not be $42.
"$35 hopefully next wk , while traders start figuring that this isn’t going to stop this company. Clean house and keep moving"

"@Harry. It amazes me how often these sorts of things happen: CEOs trying to underhandedly line their pockets knowing full well their actions could result in criminal charges and prison. I just wonder if their egos make them feel they are above the law, above eventually being held accountable, above the stockholders? The turbines will keep spinning and eventually FE will reestablish its equitable stock price. I'm waiting for what I believe to be the low before I bottom feed."
Indexes are up. I'm thinking Wall Street is sensing a Trump victory? If the Marxists win it will not be good for investors.
Wow
"FE has a history of spotty mismanagement and failure of internal controls testifies to poor management and numb bod oversight. Much worse situation than Exelon, where just one or two executives were fired and a 100 million fine was levied. So we could see more consequential penalties. Whether whole bod must resign, other executives fired, plus a bigger fine??? We shall see. I agree there may be others able to buy out the company and replace this lousy management with a respectable one."
FE. The only up in my 15 stock listing. This bodes well for the company. Sit tight and collect those divis.
I am going long.......
Just read the transcript and I believe this will go to 35 next week and back to 42 by Labor Day.Outstanding call and completely clarifies FE role in this debacle which I believe is negligible.Jones seems solid as a rock.Now FES that’s another story.
"FE stock price has fallen about $14/share since the investigation became public. There are about 540 million shares outstanding, which means the company has lost about $7.5 billion in market value over the last few days. This loss in value appears to dwarf any potential penalty it could face from this event. The SEC keeps a list of bribery cases covered under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and these penalties have rarely exceeded $1 billion.I’m not a lawyer, but based on the information we have now, it seems like the stock price has over corrected for this event"
Big difference between GAAP and NON-GAAP numbers.GAAP numbers are great. NON-GAAP not good.
Could the blatant corruption be any more apparent? Sad management rode roughshod over this golden goose. Ignorance is not such a great defense.
Sold took my very short term profit in my IRA Thank You
"The majority of the California Retirement Funds Class Actions which now have been combined will be tossed. Just based on the 10Q filed on 11-19 a 4 million consultant fee and a change in Governance policy $10 million fine tops. If you trade on facts your buying here at a great opportunity if your trading on un-factual data you'll lose. As far a a Lobbyist, signing an affidavit on what lobbyist do. far reaching at best. After seeing the Political Michael Flynn job this one is typical. But the key players continue to plead innocent and their appears to now be no more evidence saying they are not. Load the Boat."
"The allegations that Jones and other executives participated in insider trading, all before HB9 was passed, come from a shareholder lawsuit complaint filed with the court. I don’t think you can necessarily link that allegation to being fired, but it’s possible. What concerns me is there may be a link between two persons pleading guilty to federal charges, and Jones etc getting fired."
Curious if anyone has an idea why this sank almost 4% today.
My Gut says by next summer all beaten down Energy and Financials will be 100% higher then now. The trend of this virus is behind us in the next 90 Days. Upped my 30% investment into stocks to 50% today.
Is it just me or does anyone else ask . .. where are or were the Wall Street analysts and cfas covering this company? They are absolutely clueless.
Looks like a double bottom at 26.41 and 26.43 in Nov.At least we know the floor now unless some other scandal hits. I'm in with 7500 shrs at $33. I consider this a long term hold for thedividends. Although there is a serious temptation to sell if this goes right back up to the low 40's.Some other attractive quality stock would have to show up.

"In after hours today (4/23/21), CFRA raised its 12-month price target for FE from 38 to 44 and from a ""hold"" to a ""buy""."
"Wonder how much it costs FE to have the Browns Stadium named. And there is another baseball park in Reading Pa.Maybe someone can tell me, why a utility, which has little or no competition, can take part of their electric bills, and use it to have stadiums named ? Advertising for a utility regulated by the State, should also be regulated by the State. It costs millions and millions of dollars. I am going to ask the PUC to stop allowing FE, and all other utilities that operate in the State, from recouping money spent on Stadium naming. perhaps FE's price to compare would be below 6 cents, if it didn't buy stadium rights."
It will go a little up maybe 30 or 31 then will go back down will hit 24 and then will jump to 37 with some wave after down then back up to 43 am it might higher 50 long
Moving up bigly while other utes falling. Something is up!
"Firing of executives: ""the Board determined that these executives violated certain FirstEnergy policies and its code of conduct"". Anyone know if FE is liable for something? It is down big after hours?"

Why is dropping so much
Once Icahn buys the stock..price movement will be up...We wait and see...
This is a $38 to $45 stock trading at $28.91 with two upgrades from Morgan and Merrill. Load up here folks the storm is over as they say! Next year at this time this will be $50
"Hm.... this price range should be the buy area... but all we are seeing is low volume sell-off. I get it, low volume isn't concerning... but what is concerning is that no one is interested in buying at this level."
"he reason why the lawsuits will be tossed is because it appears at this point the F.B.I caught to Lobbyist that do what they do. They have First Energy paying a lobbyist firm which 99% of energy firms do. Does not mean anything illegal at First Energy occurred at all. In fact if the FBI believed that was true they would have indicated Charlie Jones and employees of First Energy. Which they clearly have not done! Lastly, the outcome of the investigation on HB6 will clearly be the same. Ohio is not going to lose its Nuke Plants and the $7.00 Surcharge with potential to have that waived in good quarters is a great deal. So here is what's going to happen in the next six months here. 1.) HB6 will be audited and the deal will stand. 2) Larry Householder and the other three who pleaded not guilty, will be found not guilty. 3) Any fines accessed to First Energy will be less then 1 million to 10 million for paying a consulting contract. 4.) All shareholder suits are without Merit. Unfortunately, firing your CEO internally over a 4 million consulting contracts governance and controls does not constitute bribery. Nobody was bribed here. How the Lobbyist firm handled payments (OK) great the lobbyist firm guy goes to jail. Moody's should be upgrading FE's debt now that the 10Q has been released. This is one of the weakest attempts ever by the environmentalists trying to raise Ohio's Energy rates. I hope the Shutter Harbor Energy.. Great it will coast Ohio Taxpayers $3 billion which they will pay and then there FE Energy Rates will triple! They will triple no matter who is running FE if you shutter those plants. So dam logical. This was a pre-election lame case to which nothing more then the two people pleading guiltily will be charged. If Charlie Jones is guilty arrest him! They have nothing. The Class Action shareholders have nothing. Oh my shares dropped 45%? means nothing so did Exxon Mobil, and many energy shares. It's not Fraud it's the market. If they sold on some bad advice and news so be it!"
It may be that the contract that was settled was with the utility regulator's company so that when he took office there would not be a conflict of interest.
I’m reading another vp got canned today. Read the 8k. Could anyone on this board explain the rot that seems to define this corporation?
"Warren Buffet always see the ""Big Picture!""The picture here with safe dividend and massive infrastructure and customers is very tempting."
"FES raised debt using FE rating. Money raised from debt was used by both FE & FES. In addition, FE takes tax advantage from FES loses and FE uses money from selling FES assets. But when time comes to repay FES debt, FES is a separate company and has nothing to do with FES. I think that FES debt investor should go after FE."

Are we at an entry point here ?
Too much internal turbulence at FE to buy at this price. I'll consider buying some when it dips below 32.
"FES raised debt using FE rating. Money raised from debt was used by both FE & FES. It's like if I take a debt in my wife's name using my credit score & then declare my wife bankrupt to avoid paying the debt. Until 2016, FE & FES had the same rating because it was assumed that FE would pay for FES debt. In addition, FE takes tax advantage from FES loses ($9B in 2016, $2.4B in 2017) and FE uses money from selling FES assets (last year sale of gas plants for almost $1B). But when time comes to repay FES debt, FES and FE are separate companies. All the individual investors should complaint to justice departments. How to report bankruptcy fraud? https://www.justice.gov/ust/report-suspected-bankruptcy-fraudFE should be reported to justice department in case of FES bankruptcy."
in at 25.70
Southern Company is interesting. They have 2 new nuclear plants about to be completed in the next year or so.
How are the large Mutual Fund holders holding the FE liable for this chaos? Who in FE answers to them? A buyout of this company would probably be the best thing that could happen. Upper management has too many ties to the regime that have been shown the door.

Solid investment!
I bought FES Bonds while they were still Investment Grade. Now they are at 32% of face value. Who is representing the FES Bond holders in the re-structuring? These are my retirement funds!!
everybody shocked over this bribery scandal...I'm just like...well...that's how our political system works...money is free speech. and corporations are people! down is up and up is down
Why down today on such a positive day for utilities? This should be a $40 stock by the end of the year.
Dividend still solid here?
Started a position last December and have been adding monthly. Future looks promising going forward and may double down with the latest quarters results. Spent a little time in Amish country this week and would recommend a trip through the rolling hills of Ohio as a great getaway.
"Bought another 1,600 shares this week. Hope to buy more soon if the price stays this low."
"I would not be surprised if American Electric and Power, does not make a $42.00 Cash and Stock offer here for FE which is trading so much undervalued to it's EPS. If not them even others."
"With the bogus fraud allegations dragging down the market price , this old line regulated utility is an attractive acquisition target..could fetch $45 per share....."
"Several Key Points: 1.)At the end of the day the way Nuke Power Plant-Surcharges, the same method used in several other states will not change. Actually, the method saves consumers millions. Any changes would just mean 35% higher Electric Rates to OHIO citizens. 2. Don't know if while folks were trying to measure the impact of the latest news about FE, which is clearly a non-issue, there has been several heat waves in the Northeast and OHIO. The Electric Demand over last year to to the Multiple Heat Waves is running 9.5% then July 2019. With longterm weather outlook stating could continue thru August. So FE is a $45.00 to $50.00 stock mispriced by $15.00 to $20.00 a share. I would not expect that misalignment to last pay ext week. Missing also is the $1.59 annualized dividend which FE appears to forecast it's ability to maintain. 3.) If you think this is a issue take a look at how Defense Contractors do business. 4.) The only Class Action Lawsuit that I foresee is shareholder stupidity for selling into such stupidity and at the end of the day Shareholders actual recourse for any losses may indeed ones the shareholders should bring against the Law Firms for ambulance chasing without facts. Any losses due to the price drop in FE is not FE's fault it's Shareholder Stupidity Day Trading on non-factual news and against the Legal Firms who public such meaningless non factual ambulance chasing news. Lastly, Lobbyist they exist in all industries more so in the Defense Contract space. But in this case Bad Bad Lobbyist! Agree. But the underlying outcome is one utilized by Multiple States regards the closure of Nuke Power Plants. Next Friday $37.00 Close for FE easey monty."
Icahn wants to sell parts of Mon Power. I suppose rural electrification companies would be interested in the less populated heavily wooded areas as they can charge more for the same product and services. This will of course shrink revenue. It seems First Energy is always chasing gold only to end up with manure.
"When will the bottom fall out? I know they are now making money (finally) again, but every time the stock would touch 40, it would quickly fall out back down to 30. Hope some investors shake out and sell. This stock is a steal at 30."
Morningstar just affirmed their $44 fair value for FE. They concluded that FE and FE Solutions have been entirely separate entities since 2018. They also stated that FE stood to benefit little from HB 6 and were therefore skeptical of any untoward lobbying.
Taking bribes does not affect the operations enough to justify a near 50% loss. Easy money here
Yesterdays selling should have been enough...Todays selling is panic selling creating a buying opportunity...JMHO
Sold 600 shares of Denny’s today after buying last week Friday for a 13%profit.. Guys.. i’m putting that money on FE now.. Guys this is going to come roaring back hard!!!! It’s easy money in January!! Big MONEY!!
Time to buy more. Compared to its peers it's so undervalued. PT of 37.5$
I could see fe @ $40s by yr end. This will get sorted out. No sweat
Time to start buying this one back. The dividend is too hard to pass up.
Hit 34+ and is falling back. Why?
Holding for 1 year. Divy and capital gains should yield 20% gains minimum. Sooner I get that the sooner I sell 80percent of my position
I heard a stock analyst answer a question about what happened to First Energy last week..He said that in his opinion the dividend might be at risk....A lot of people are going to have to testify and the question that needs answered is just how involved was FE in the payoffs and did any of the people at the top know what was going on......JMHO
In it for the respectable 4.5% Qualified Dividend and now some growth. Can't beat the good combo.
"A few months ago I bought this stock for $27.50 because some people thought it would go down but they were wrong and it didn't go down because it went up instead. Now it is worth $32.50 so that means it is worth about 18% more than I paid but I also got a dividend so that means I am up about 20% so I'm pretty happy about that. Now I can just sell it, or I can just hold it, or I can just sell Jan $35 covered call options for $2.50 or I could do some combination of these things but I don't know what to do. For me the hardest thing about investing in stocks is knowing what to do."
"The IRAN Middle East tension are going to kick Energy Companies up 18% on Monday, The Morgan Stanley analyst is correct you buy when the downdraft is more political in nature then business in nature. The Harbor Energy deal for $7.00 surcharge I hope they do audit, because I think the number should really be $12.00. I want to know why OHIO Consumers are only getting charged $7.00 with the luxury of that going even lower in years of profitability and the people of Chicago have to pay $12.00 in the Exelon Energy similar deal. I think the audit they want will end up raising the Fee to $10.00 at least. Also, at this stage if OHIO Legislature wants to shut down the OHIO Nuke plants, I'm good with that also. Because then OHIO consumers First Energy electric rates will triple and FE will be $70.00 a share by the end of 2021. You can't get cleaner energy then with Nuke Power. The Alternatives in OHIO are very limited, unless you want to ramp up Fossil Fuel generation or Coal Generation. If Ohio Consumers feel AEP or Exelon will provide cheaper rates then First Energy then fine! Stockholders a FE are ok with a Cash and Stock buyout of First Energy by AEP for $35.00 cash plus 1 Share of AEP for every 4 of AEP. As Joe Biden would say folks: The massive housing building and new customers base at FE, over the past year is not going to stop. The U.S. Population and energy demand in the FE service area is not going to get smaller. Just the transition to Electric Cars over the next 10 years is going to triple demand. Ohio Consumers should not be looking at trying to figure out how to hurt it's nuke plants, it actually should be asking when will we build more? Load up this will $60 in the next 12 months."
guys told u 2 hold ..its utility with heavy discounted price ...we will soon launch to above 35
"The Board has taken action to help authorities. This malfeasance is due to individuals not the Corporation. The Corp will aid in the investigation to purge the company. While the Corp may get fined as they have deep pockets, it will be minor relative to the financial resoiurtces. The stock has discounted this issue by 50% of the stock price. That seems sufficient. Now it is just news traders spreading rumors about a delisting. The financials will be correct as the Corp officers have to sign off and have personal liability."
I sold this dog and bought NGG. It is a better run company with no scandals and solid management.

"Hmmm. Approaching 30. Look at the other utes today, almost all negative. Me thinks someone knows inside scoop. Either the investigators have begun winding down or could a buyer be snooping around??"
"Still cheap, considering buying more."
"Okey doke so the brains on the 19th floor with their helpers on Wall Street both financial and legal wanna offer a lucky someone a chance to own 20 percent of fes transmission business for 2.5 billion. So just thinking out loud. That means fe values the tax business at roughly 12.5 billion. The market cap of the entire company is currently around 20.5 billion. So that means the everything else is valued roughly at 8 billion. I just my first question to would be why would anyone pay 2.5 billion for a 20 percent stake in the tax business. I well understand that tax is where the money is made and the recovery of capital spent is easy. But I dunno. Is the price being asked at all reasonable? This one puzzles me a little. My initial sense is hat there is a lot of wishful thinking going on here regarding the offer, especially regarding price. But I’d love to hear other opinions. All in all it’s kinda of a strange deal to me at least. Although I think I may have read duke did something similar."
I’ve been saving so much money on electricity since my wife always keeps the lights off when her boyfriend comes over. The savings alone pays for my shares!

In addition, FE takes tax advantage of FES loses ($9B in 2016 and $2.4B in 2017) and FE uses money from selling FES assets (e.g. last year sale of gas plants for $1B). Now FES is going bankrupt and FE is claiming that it has nothing to do with FES debt. Situation is very similar to banks in 2008-2009. Banks were not allowed to spin out and bankrupt their mortgage businesses while keeping their other productive assets. That's why FE should not be allowed to declare FES bankrupt while keeping other assets. It's hard for individual investors like me to fight FE (& its partner billionaire investor, Paul Singer)."
way over sold ....earning will.b good ...due to covid home stay electric usags
"From what I gather, the ohio AG investigation is over. There is no fine levied, only forgoing the transmission surcharge past and future, in addition to the management tightening up compliance activities. If this is correct, and confirmed on the CC Thursday, this mother is going up big time. To what? I’d guess 35 minimum, 38 potentially."
"I love this stock. Great buy at ~ $30. Hold for the dividend, and sell whenever it gets to $35+. Anything else (like growth!!) is icing on the cake."
told u guys hold ..it will rise
Pretty sad price action today considering good earnings. Looks like people cutting positions and it wants to test lower. Better opportunity to buy
We did it! We closed above $40.00! Wee!!!
Cheapest price in 20 years? Seems like a great opportunity. Wish I had caught this yesterday. But I’ll take this price
A New 52 Week high....again.....today....!
Will only go up from now. Old news are absorbed already. Cheers got in
AEP is chomping at the bit to grab FE at these fire sale prices...a bid in the high $40 will be forthcoming before year end....in the public utilities section these gifts don’t come along very often....
at least the ads from the law firms have stopped on the yahoo news feed for FE.
whats with the debt draw down? i guess they figured theyre not carrying enough and how else to fund their salaries and fat dividends while the ship goes down.
"The chairman of the Ohio PUC resigned. And rightfully so. Will we see jail time ?FE is down, because of improper and illegal payments authorized by certain executives.While FE should repay any money they made by these illegal actions, the penalties and fines should be born by the management involved. Not by shareholders and FE customers. As a customer and shareholder, I don't want FE doing illegal activities. I don't condone it, I don't authorize it, and I don't profit from it. We are innocent. Ohio better not authorize higher rates to pay for legal costs of this corrupt management. And Pennsylvania."

Anybody have news as to the status of the investigation?
Until the source of the $1.5 billion bribe is determine everything is up in the air. Is FE involved? Even if FE can maintained its dividend at $1.56/share at 27.09 that's only 5.75%.
"though most utilities have risen in last month, this one seems it is being accumulated"
Keeping my small position from yesterday. In at $28.49. Feel like this was one of those rare lucky price breaks the market throws at people from time to time. The dividend is the cherry on top.

"(Bloomberg) -- FirstEnergy Corp.’s chief executive officer said he never gave money directly to a lobbyist in his life as he continued to assert the company did nothing wrong by pushing for an Ohio law to subsidize nuclear power plants owned by its former subsidiary.CEO Charles Jones said the company hasn’t had control of decisions made by its former FirstEnergy Solutions unit, now Energy Harbor, since November 2016. And he said FirstEnergy is in talks with U.S. Justice Department lawyers after receiving subpoenas related to the alleged racketeering conspiracy involving to the passage of the reactor subsides last year.“FirstEnergy acted properly in this matter, and we intend to cooperate fully with the investigation,” Jones said on a call with analysts to discuss the company’s second-quarter results. “I’ve never made a payment directly to a lobbyist in my life, nor asked any lobbyist to make a payment.”The company’s shares rose as much as 10%.On Tuesday, federal authorities arrested Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four political associates, saying they took $61 million in bribes in connection to the bailout. Prosecutors said the money came from a corporation -- identified in court papers only as “Company A” -- in exchange for supporting the measure.FirstEnergy has not been charged. Nor was it named in the complaint filed by federal prosecutors. Nonetheless, its shares have lost about one-third of their value since the scandal broke.Jones said he didn’t believe that all the statements attributed to a “CEO” in court documents filed by prosecutors are referring to him.“I don’t know who it was, but it was not me,” he said on the call.FirstEnergy Solutions changed its name to Energy Harbor when it emerged from Chapter 11 earlier this year and spun off from its parent."
Most stocks with nice dividends go up right up to their ex dividend date. I'm holding.
"FE finally got rid of TMI. Nuclear energy is not green. It stays dangerous for half a million years.It was Carter that made it illegal for energy companies to try to reprocess spent fuel, due to terrorism concerns. Now that Hillary gave Russia ownership of 20% of our uranium mines, and a significant portion of material has already been lost or stolen, it doesn't make any sense to continue worrying about reprocessing. THEY ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH TO DO THEIR JOB."
"Some more fun in The news today. 4 million dollar consulting fee. Again, I ask, where are the analysts? They supposedly scour the financials. In the end they are just toadies. They must have been really good consultants for that price! Here?s a suggestion to whoever might be in charge and honest out there...if there is anyone who fits that bill. Hire Harry markopolus to investigate this cluster #$%$ Purge the Augean stables."
"Continuing strong movement today, again while the sector is trending slightly down. Something is about to break. Glad I’m on board this train."
"It’s going back up over time. Don’t listen to the sheep that feed you a different narrative. It’s a utility stock. Good dividend and regulated. You’ll be handsomely rewarded over time.And of course, the lawyers couldn’t wait to sue."

Chuck jones news release in yahoo finance…seriously.. The guy sends out a news release the day of or after the settlement. How lame. Obviously done for legal or financial reasons.The release sez and claims he did nothing illegal. So be it. I’ll ride with that. But why’d the bored fire you big guy? Answer that one in a news release.
I suppose the BOD was asleep while this debacle was being constructed. Get rid of the whole bunch! They continue to collect hefty sums while stockholders suffer. Time for all of you house cats to clear out!
FE thinks that Elliott would save FE. They should remember that Elliott is an activist investor that only cares for itself with short term objectives. It's CEO's job to run company efficiently for long term survival instead of depending on activist.
here is the webcast that just started. sound good so far )
"Good idea getting out of the nuclear business. One utility I will not buy is SO. They have interest in the construction of a new fission power plant. It's already WAY over budget and getting more expensive every month. The power it will produce will be incredibly expensive.How is that for the promise they made back in the '60s when they said electricity will be ""too cheap to bother to meter""."
This is going to me a good invested if things (markets)get rough.
Is it still a good price to enter?. Or wait until the issue is resolved?
"With all due respect to Carl, his involvement in other companies like HTZ, Nuance...were not good for shareholders."
I see several downgrades but no sell ratings yet.....
Twice now I've posted a note from wikipedia about Icahn. Twice it's been deleted. I give up.
You can do a song and dance but there are institutions that want a 5%+ divy big name utility company and will be more than happy to hold shares for YEARS.
What’s up today?
Great Earnings report!......Please!.......increase the dividend to fifty cents a share.
"Court Denies FirstEnergy?s Attempt to Evade Environmental Responsibilities EDF statement from #$%$ Munson, Director, Midwest Clean EnergyApril 4, 2019 (COLUMBUS, OH) The U.S. Bankruptcy Court today ruled that FirstEnergy could not use its subsidiary?s bankruptcy filing to evade its environmental clean-up and remediation responsibilities. The subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions filed for bankruptcy in order to reduce its debt, but it also tried to release its parent company, FirstEnergy, of all liabilities associated with cleaning up poisonous coal-ash pits and decommissioning radioactive reactors. Federal and state agencies in Ohio and Pennsylvania recently joined Environmental Defense Fund and its environmental and consumer allies to oppose these evasive efforts by FirstEnergy.?FirstEnergy hoped to simply walk away from a steaming pile of expensive, hazardous waste. Thankfully, today?s decision makes clear that the company can?t avoid its environmental responsibilities.?"
"FirstEnergy had a pretty good week (ending 4/16/21), advancing 2.645%. Electric utilities are hot right now (no pun intended) and a favorable earnings report next week should generate further share value appreciation. May 6 is just around the corner. Good luck to all longs."

Why is this tanking?
remember it is utility company ..which is backbone of infrastructure ...i think it will hang around 35 ..till issues resolved
This is utility stock. It is bribery case . It is not going anywhere. It will stay.
I’m a happy investor this has positive movement
"It is appalling to see the statement that the fired ex CEO put out. Even though texts, phone calls,etc., say otherwise. I am a retiree from FE and I know that myself and thousands of others are extremely embarrassed by his behaviors."
Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday voiced support for keeping House Bill 6′s billion-dollar nuclear bailout in place even though federal authorities assert it was the product of the largest bribery scheme in Ohio history.
17 million short interest three days ago. about 1.5 million of that covered at the close over the past three days. Thus figure 15.5 million shares short with the Bollinger Point just broken at $28.50 next easy target is $31.50 with the short interest we can blow past that...
"It's interesting to watch. All chat rooms have similar patterns and utility chat room is an oxymoron, old conservative industry invaded by punks with digital power. But the cream always rises, you can see who knows the industry, macroecon, history. A young guy drawn to a utility because he's instinctively a bottom fisher(value investor) and watches percentage change lists is great. He's on the right path long term . Contrast that with the obvious spewers who have no chance long term. 90% of options buyers lose money....therefore 90% of options sellers make money. (this will be censored because of this last phrase) peace out"
Going up today! New substation fencing. Install more fencing.
RSI chart in overbought oversold means nothing today in upside. way oversold
"Many of you may not be aware that even though the ex CEO was fired, there are many in place currently that he placed in positions that should not have been. It's difficult to increase stock price when you have the same group in place that will continue with his same ideology. I know, I worked with all of them. Point being, it's time for a wholesale change unless you want the same behaviors to take root. Demand the Board make changes."
Looks like dividend cut will have to happen if they are going to lose the $1.5 Billon Ohio spent to save this POS company. This is the next Enron.
Not even considered selling unless $40
this price for utility stock is a big lunch for investors like warren
"A the end of the day it will be deemed that Larry Householder was working to secure the best alternative for OHIO Electric Consumers as was the entire Legislature. Lastly, in fact when Legislature completes is Audit of Harbor Energy and does a compare versus Excelon Energy, they are going to come to the same exact conclusion that the agreement entered was one of the best deals in the industry. In fact, like I said in a previous post I want to know why are OHIO consumers only paying a $7.00 surcharge when Indiana consumers are paying 12.50?? What's good for Harbor Energy is this new Democratic Lead Audit may actually determine that the surcharge rate really should be closer to $12.50 and Ohio Consumers get the rate hike the democrats want to occur. Again, a political pre-election stunt the democrats pulled here and First Energy is going back to $52.00"
"Anyone remember WorldCom? They said it could never go broke either....""The WorldCom scandal was a major accounting scandal that came to light in the summer of 2002 at WorldCom, the USA's second largest long-distance telephone company at the time. From 1999 to 2002, senior executives at WorldCom led by founder and CEO Bernard Ebbers orchestrated a scheme to inflate earnings in order to maintain WorldCom's stock price.[1] The fraud was uncovered in June 2002 when the company's internal audit unit, led by vice president Cynthia Cooper, discovered over $3.8 billion of fraudulent balance sheet entries. Eventually, WorldCom was forced to admit that it had overstated its assets by over $11 billion. At the time, it was the largest accounting fraud in American history."""

"Recently an activist investor/hedge fund barged their way around helping with First Energy Solutions. When they vacated, the stock price was up appreciably. Additionally five executives have since been fired for helping to spin off First Energy Solutions. Ohio politicians grabbed by the FBI for helping collect a few dollars. Stock dropped like a rock and company in poor condition. The CEO and hedge fund made out like fat rats. Now another activist looking to strip the last bit of meat from the bone. The new activist has already improved the stock price and has to back up the hype. A regulated electric utility has limited options for improvement without lobby for rates. This will be a propaganda parade about how costs are being cut and processes streamlined. I don't want to speculate on cost cutting measures that may be taken because we're down to the bone!"
"Hello. I guess I got lucky. Bought a few shares yesterday. Did some research and it seems like FE is going in the right directions after the legal mess, virus and so on. Now of course, we all want FE to be $100000 per share but realistically do you think it could go back to $50ish?Not an expert at all here"
nice to see FE gaining....not sure why! trading at 240x earnings. I guess that's better than not having earnings!
"Per Barron's, FirstEnergy rates as an ""Overweight"" at this time, based on the ratings of 17 analysts. Eight analysts give it a ""Buy"", one an ""Overweight"", seven a ""Hold"" and one a ""Sell"". Barron's also shows that MarketGrader rates it as a ""Buy"" at this time."
FE has moved in the last 6 monthsUp very wellDoesn’t anyone ever talk bout it Anyone out there????I’m sitting on a bunch of shares any thoughts from anyone
Buying opportunity. It's not like they were cooking the books.
All looked good on earnings including full year guidance. Also it isn't sound like there was much sweat briefing that FE was NOT involved in this political bs. Could head back to 40 quickly
I’m feeling bullish on FE after Chuck Jones statements. If he had something to hide he would have said nothing. To much risk to himself and FE to make false statements.
Don't miss this article. I suggest you read it twice.https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-08-18/ohio-ag-seeks-to-halt-payouts-in-nuke-plants-bankruptcy
It's a beat. .58 earnings on 2.5B. On the top end of their guidance.Should be interesting tomorrow. A cleverly worded press release would do wonders for the pps
Just pay a fine and go back to printing money.
I am preparing a similar letter to what Ajay wrote. FES depended on the credit rating of FE to sell Bonds to current bond holders. FES should be backed by FE who is financing extensive T&D.
"The Ohio House is considering a piece of legislation, HB6, that will create a new fee on electric bills and scrap the state’s green energy standards. FirstEnergy Solutions’ two nuclear plants would stand to greatly benefit from the bill through large subsidies. There’s a long history between FirstEnergy Solutions and its former parent company FirstEnergy Corp, a large GOP donor.FirstEnergy Corp and FirstEnergy Solutions are not the same company.That’s the one thing Chuck Jones, FirstEnergy Corp’s CEO, wanted to make very clear to Ohio lawmakers in a letter he sent in February. They might share the same name, but they’re not operated by the same people. They are independent of each other.And FirstEnergy Solutions may have been a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp, up until last year, but they are not the same company anymore.FirstEnergy Corp is an energy distribution company, which delivers power to homes in northeast Ohio, and charges for that transmission through a monthly electric bill.FirstEnergy Solutions is an energy generation company, which runs power plants including coal and nuclear."
FE will be fine.. all the panic abt late filing and bribery scandal is all water under the bridge.
Their transmission towers would Would be a good place to start I’m sure they could hang all of upper management and whoever else was involved And the tower would still be structurally sound
Paul if it’s open for $22 I will triple my shares for sure.
"After earning, $30+"
So the chuckster after his lame press release now gets nominated to be added to the Ohio attorney generals racketeering lawsuit along with the vile and lecherous co conspirator Mickey dowling and randazzo who earned $22 million for part time legal work. Nice work if you can get it. The article I read said they couldn’t be reached for comment. You can’t make this stuff up. I can’t wait to see the number of down posts this results in. Cause there are mouth breathers and snot gobblers out there still that continue to believe these are virtuous people.
What is the difference between what they did and lobbying? Seems synonymous... why is it illegal?
Classic market over-reaction. I'm in at $28.36 and have no doubt I'll see way higher.

Don't you just love it when a negative news article about a Canadian stock with the same symbol (First Energy Metals-cndn FE) makes your stock go down.
Bad timing on my part. I sold half of my position on Tuesday.
"I don't understand this ""earnings report"". FES is in bankruptcy."
Last week I thought about buying some FE for $29. Today I bought some FE for $27.50 so I'm pretty happy I didn't buy last week.
"How low does the share price hit this week? In the last 20 years, any company with a ""scandal"" has its share price destroyed. Most recently, I think of Luckin Coffee. It traded over $50 per share in January, 2020. Now, it's under 3 bucks. How low does First Energy go? $10? $5?"
Looking forward to my calls $30 for only .8. This could be a huge payoff with low risk. Fingers crossed 35-40 by October 16!
"What does this company do? I randomly typed in first, because I want to invest in a company with ''first'' in the name."
"The CEO said they have not done anything illegal. The investigation, so far, has not charged anyone from the company. The case is very similar to what had happened to ComEd where they paid $200 million to settle without admitting guilt to the charges. Similarly, the worst thing that can happen to FE is that they pay some amount of fine and that should be it."
"American Electric Power (AEP) has to be doing the due diligence, once again as in 2016 to Merge with FE. That Cash and Stock deal would be worth $47.00 per share to FE and give AEP the accounts and they want and need in OHIO. Not that FE can't run on it's own power and easily get back to $52.00. But AEP representatives are circling."
"Considering that FE went ex-dividend today, the session turned into a pretty good one for the stock with that nice advance in the last hour. Go FE!"
"Stop telling yourself this will rise to $40... don’t listen to anyone, either i or anyone.one big mistake is getting attached to a stock, Even thou they beat earnings, they still got investigation going on... so stay on the look out because anynews could crash or rise this.. if they come out positive from the investigation, it will pop so high but if they come out negative, it will drop so hard... so be on the lookout"
Great buying opportunity....I'm sure they will just have to pay a fine and everything will move on.It should be above 30 this week after the 2 day jitters.
"Ex Div August 6. Got to keep it till then, not? Nice yield."
The odds have improved greatly that a large utility company will take advantage of this chaos and buy this company at a bargain
"This puts a serious support to the lawsuits. True or not, the investing public will see this as FE is guilty and the lawsuit(s) will have a better chance of exacting some real money."
Ok day traders start chasing!
I just saw this.... Warren Buffetthttps://247wallst.com/infrastructure/2020/07/23/why-warren-buffett-may-get-involved-in-the-firstenergy-stock-fiasco/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+247wallst_partners+%2824%2F7+Wall+St.+-+Syndication+Partners%29&mod=mw_quote_news
"In the last billing mailing, First Energy boasts how their employees raised 3.6 million in their annual fundraising. Since many local affiliates give to planned parenthood, it would be wise for FE to consider another charity, like the Red Cross, to raise money for."
"The question you have to ask: ""Is this scandal going to affect the companies earnings?""Most likely it will but (my opinion) not that much.So now do I have a chance to pick up some shares on the cheap and get a really good dividend rate?"
it's going to get a lot cheaper soon so you can all buy more.
"BofA analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith upgraded the rating for FirstEnergy from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $32 to $37."
Still holding my 500 shares...entered at $23.50. Not selling until it reaches at least $40.
"Here is a May letter to the editor from the CEO to the Cleveland BladeTo the editor: Blade unfair to FirstEnergy MAY 19, 2020 10:00 PMI was greatly disappointed to read the May 15 editorial “FirstEnergy’s Bad Math.” Full of misleading statements and assumptions, it should more accurately be titled “Toledo Blade’s Bad Journalism.”While The Blade even acknowledges the full separation between FirstEnergy Corp. and FirstEnergy Solutions (formerly FES, now Energy Harbor), the editorial still attempts to marry recent actions taken by Energy Harbor to FirstEnergy Corp.The fact is the two companies have no relationship to one another, and the actions of Energy Harbor have no legal, financial, or other bearing on FirstEnergy Corp.In late 2016, FirstEnergy Corp. made the decision to exit from its competitive generating business — FES — and become a fully regulated utility company.Soon after, FES appointed an independent board of directors and retained its own separate legal and financial advisers.The finances of the two companies were separated in early 2018, and in March, 2018, FES filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. FES emerged from bankruptcy as Energy Harbor earlier this year.FirstEnergy Corp. and its other subsidiaries were not part of the Chapter 11 filing. To suggest the company was “crying poor and demanding a $1 billion bailout,” or was a “bankrupt company” is patently false.Our regulated utility operating companies have remained strong, delivering reliable and affordable electricity to our more than 6 million customers.It’s a shame The Blade insists on continuing its long history of smearing our good name, in this case by tying it to actions by a company that has no legal, financial, or operational connection to ours.While it could be passed off as ignorance or bad reporting by an individual reporter, an editorial board cannot use these excuses to justify such blatant smear tactics.CHARLES JONESPresident and Chief Executive Officer,FirstEnergy Corp. Big, not fastPresident Trump’s claim that we will have a vaccine for the coronavirus before the end of 2020, which will be “big and fast like the Manhattan Project” is another example of his lack of knowledge of American history.If I were a betting woman, I would wager that he has no clue what the Manhattan Project entailed. Yes, it was big, but it wasn’t fast. From inception (1939) when discussions and theorizing got under way, to completion July 16, 1945 was six years.It seemed an eternity to American leaders who feared the Germans were ahead in building a weapon using nuclear technology.In January, 2017, en route to Asia, Mr. Trump stopped in Hawaii. He was given a private tour of Pearl Harbor.By some accounts, he had a vague idea of some battle there and asked his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, why they were visiting this location. The above are just two of the multiple accounts showing his ignorance of U.S. history.

"FirstEnergy Announces Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsAffirms Guidance and Long-Term Growth Projections, Provides Third Quarter 2020 Guidance, Comments on DOJ InvestigationCompany Release - 7/23/2020 4:42 PM ETAKRON, Ohio, July 23, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $309 million, or $0.57 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $2.5 billion. In the second quarter of 2019, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $308 million, or $0.58 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $2.5 billion. Second quarter results include the impact of special items listed below.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the second quarter of 2020 were $0.57 per share, near the top end of the company's guidance. In the second quarter of 2019, operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $0.61 per share.""I am extremely proud of the performance by our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy chief executive officer. ""They have not missed a beat as they adapted to new work protocols to keep each other safe and continued delivering energy to our customers. At the same time, our fully regulated business model and rate structure are providing a measure of stability through the economic slowdown, and we remain on track to meet our commitments to the investment community.""""We intend to cooperate fully with the Department of Justice investigation involving the Ohio Speaker of the House, and we will ensure our company's involvement in supporting HB 6 is understood as accurately as possible,"" Jones said. ""I believe that FirstEnergy acted ethically in this matter. At no time did our support for Ohio's nuclear plants interfere with or supersede our ethical obligations to conduct our business properly. I believe the facts will become clear as the investigation progresses.""For the third quarter of 2020, FirstEnergy is providing a GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) forecast range of $395 million to $450 million, or $0.73 to $0.83 per share based on 542 million shares outstanding.The company is affirming its full-year 2020 GAAP earnings forecast range of $1.02 billion to $1.13 billion, or $1.88 to $2.08 per share, based on 542 million shares, as well as its full-year operating (non-GAAP) guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.FirstEnergy is also affirming its long-term growth rate projections. The company remains on track to achieve 6% to 8% compound annual operating (non-GAAP) earnings growth (CAGR)** from 2018 to 2021, as well as its extended CAGR of 5% to 7% through 2023. That projection includes plans to issue up to $600 million of equity annually starting in 2022 to fund the company's regulated growth initiatives.Second Quarter ResultsIn FirstEnergy's Regulated Distribution business, second quarter 2020 operating results benefited from higher residential volume, incremental rider revenues in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and weather-related usage. These factors were offset by the absence of the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider and higher expenses compared to the second quarter of 2019. Total distribution deliveries decreased 3.1% compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic on commercial and industrial sales. Residential sales increased 17.1%, as a result of the stay-at-home orders in our service territories and a benefit from weather-related customer usage compared to the second quarter of 2019. Commercial deliveries decreased 14.4%, while sales to industrial customers decreased 11.7%. In the Regulated Transmission business, second quarter 2020 operating results decreased slightly primarily due to higher net financing costs and a true-up of the formula rate, which offset higher rate base associated with the company's ongoing investments in its Energizing the Future transmission program. In the Corporate/Other segment, second quarter 2020 operating results reflect higher expenses compared to the same quarter of 2019.For the first half of 2020, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $383 million, or $0.71 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $5.2 billion. This compares to GAAP earnings of $623 million or $1.17 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $5.4 billion in the first six months of 2019. Results for both periods reflect the impact of special items listed below.Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* for the first half of 2020 were $1.23 per share, compared to $1.28 per share in the first half of 2019."
"Sell today and watch it hit $38 in no time. I've seen this sort of behavior over and over. Shyster law firms appear and work in concert with short sellers, but the end result is always the same: once the shorts bank some coin, a short-covering rally brings the stock back to the long-term moving average, which in this case, $38-42. I'll pick $38 for the low end, just to be cautious."
"Commercial deliveries decreased 7.5%, while sales to industrial customers decreased 3.0%. How will that look in the next quarter with 22 million unemployed."
"Before leading the commission, Randazzo was a lobbyist and an attorney for energy companies and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, which represents some of the state’s largest industries.

"According to their website, FE, Met Ed, whatever, is going to raise 600 million annually staring in 2022, by selling equity (more shares), to fund their growth program. Anyone get a mailing saying Met Ed's rates ae going up 14.88 on Dec 1st ?Hows come the PUC doesn't make FE tell us what any approved rates are in the near future. The way we find out now is, get our bill, read the various rates, and compare to what it was. To me, Met Ed should be required to give notice, in the bill preceeding a rate increase. If you look at the message area of the bill, theres plenty of room to notify people in advance. On the current bill, it says ""on Oct 1 the Distribution charge was adjusted..."" Hey, tell us the month before, and tell us what the charge was, and what it will be. Don't just say it changed. And why not say the last time a change was made. Tell us in Sept ""On oct 1, the dist charge will go up 5%. The last time it changed was in 2017."" Is that too much to ask for ? Keep us informed. If not for us, you wouldn't have a company. Don't treat us like shareholders."
With what's going on at FE... pushing the earning's date to tomorrow 10AM EST seems even more suspicious....
The scandal of FE's lies continues. Did you know that they also lied about one of the nuke plants having a hole in one of the containment heads ?Read all about it.

Several have no price per KWH listed, and promise you a rate based on your usage and Other Things. Wonder if some of these LLC companies are there, just to collect customer information ? Keep up the good work PUC. You seem to be helping these con companies more than customers."
Thank you Icahn! 
like FE is distancing itself from scandal ....loongs u should also make a distance from shorties here 
Whose day got better because of our little FE cause she’s looking ‘sooo... fine’ !!!!
"FirstEnergy's top lawyer, chief ethics officer are out; acting CEO gets $150,000 pay raise"
All yuz. You’ve been long and wrong so long. When does this red headed stepchild crack 40? Come on for crissakes. Tell me.
"My broker just sent me a corrected 1099DIV statement about the reclassification of First Energy dividends for September (45%) and December (100%) of 2019 as non-dividend distributions. I assume all who hold the stock will get similar statements, and will have to file amended tax returns for 2019.How in hell could FE officials not know the proper classification of the distributions when they were made so the info they sent to brokers would be correct? The 8937 forms they filed with the IRS were dated June 29, 2020. https://investors.firstenergycorp.com/Dividend-ReturnOfCapital/Index?KeyGenPage=1073754620"
utility stock n is 40 percent discount ....those who r still.thinking to jump in r ..........
"HB6, Even if the OHIO Legislature repeals HB6 in 2021. It will really only mean one thing for Ohio Electric customers much higher Electric Rates then the $7.00 per household charge, which is a lot cheaper then many other states with mouth balled Nuke Power plants charge. If they want to shutter the two Nuke plants in Ohio all Ohio consumers would see rates increase triple digits. Going out to the free market and buying energy will be way higher then the $7.00 surcharge. So it's really not how the deal got done, because anyone looking at the deal can see it was a great deal for Ohio consumers. That's most lively why Larry House holder was re-elected. So you want a Judge to shut down Harbor Energy. Then What! what does that do! Do you want a Judge to stop Nuke Power generation for OHIO and it's Factories! Then what? FE or AEP would just go out to the free market for Energy and charge consumers huge rates! What we have her in this First Energy Deal is just a bunch of Politics and if Consumers and Investors want to leave it up to a OHIO Judge on what's better for Ohio Consumer's in a court of law and trials based on Advertising what's better for OHIO Electric Consumers. You all are going to be amazed on the outcome. Not only was HB6 the way to go, it's backed by facts and hard numbers. The impact of repealing HB6 is horrific for consumers and legislation and Judge in the world would no that. In fact Ohio Consumers compared to most states got a great deal. Plus, the deal actually allows the $7.00 surcharge to be lower in times of peak output. So those thinking Harbor Energy and Ohio Nuke Plant's are going away forever due to Political Funding lobbyist scandal are truly mistaken. Because at the end of the day any audit firm looking into HB6 Legislation in OHIO, will tell you they wish they could have gotten that deal for the firms in other states. Repeal is just environmental people talk that hate Nuke Power! Problem is OHIO a leading Manufacturing state needs the POWER. There are no jobs without power and if you take Nuke plants down. Ohio Consumer and Retail Energy rates would increase by 35% to 40%. People in OHIO should be saying thank god for Nuke Power. It's clean. Take them away and what do you replace them with Solor? Not enouh for OHIO Industry!"
"Reply to This will be $22 monday. If this sinks to $22 for what ever reason(definite will not), I'm taking a big loan and buying so many of this sp500 company and then I will be very rich."
Dont sell out of desperation. This stocks way below value. Dont think also the scandal affects company performance. It does not. They are not facing charges. Its another company tied to it that is. FE is fine. NO one working for them is in trouble either. People post to try scaring you into selling so they can buy up shares. Hold tight and let it ride up over time. Also earnings tomorrow will be great as people are home more and spending more time home means more electric usage which means more profit.
Top 200s SP500 company that beat earnings. Bribery does not affect business model. Its utility company during a time of stock market uncertainty. You crazy if you dont buy this for a discount.
After hours results look good and tomorrow we learn the detail of the resolution of the FES bankruptcy. Results beat and guidance is good...We may see 40 by year end....
Got out at 27. Enough is enough. Good Luck all. You're going to need it.
Bank of America Downgrade the stock To $ 30.00
"The company should consider purchasing shares hand over fist at 30, 35 not when it goes back to 45+!"
I got a few hundred shares of FE a couple of months ago because I saw chance to collect a good dividend and some growth. So far it is working out and hope to keep adding as the cash come in. GLTA.
Bought 1000 shares yesterday at $37.26 thinking it was a over reaction and then I watched it go south to the close but when I signed on this morning and saw it under $26 I bought another 1000 at $25.72. At least that has my average down to $31.49 and I'm real comfortable at that level but time will prove me right or wrong. The Morningstar analyst on this stock commented earlier this morning on the news and after considering it - maintained his Fair Value at $44.00. I have a Merrill Edge account and the Merrill analyst just lowered his price objective from $45.50 to $36.50.
From a pure Tech Analysis standpoint we break $28.50 we go to $37.00. OGE another energy stock with negative earnings and negative P/E has been above $30.00 for weeks now. FE will get upgrades this week as the Political Lobbyist Saga at FE wanes and fabricated lawsuits with not much evidence other then the typical day to day Lobbyist actions also wane. Blast off to $37 coming.
FE filing with PUCO states that money put towards political or charitable spending did not come from ratepayers.
"Any potential delisting on the NYSE would be at least six months away. FirstEnergy on Wednesday said that while it missed an already-delayed Monday deadline to file its third-quarter financial report, it still expects to file. The report is tied to third-quarter earnings FirstEnergy released on Nov. 2.The quarterly filing was delayed because the utility said it needs more time to ""provide appropriate disclosure"" and other information tied to the ongoing federal investigation into the $61 million Larry Householder bribery scandal that has involved FirstEnergy, its former subsidiary Energy Harbor, and others over the passage of House Bill 6. The law provides more than $1 billion in subsidies to the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants now owned by Energy Harbor.FirstEnergy fired its chief executive officer and two other senior executives in late October as a result of an ongoing internal investigation. Its top lawyer and its chief ethics officer were also ""separated"" from the utility last week.""The company intends to become current in its SEC reporting obligations as soon as possible,"" FirstEnergy said in a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The NYSE notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the company’s stock on the NYSE or on any of the company’s outstanding bonds,"" FirstEnergy said in the filing. ""The NYSE informed the company that, under the NYSE’s rules, the company has six months, until May 17, 2021, to file its Form 10-Q, and any subsequent delayed filings and regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards."""
Wells Fargo maintains PT at $40
"FE back to $30 and higher, this isn’t the end of this company, I am sure they are cooperating and are making and selling energy "
How much of 2020 dividends will be return of capital?
"I'v owned fe since the mid 1970""s along with dominion, duke and others. this is the worse company I""v ever owned and the only one that ever cut it""s dividends. Don""t be deceived !"
Someone else and I both heard dividend cut is coming for Nov Ex-date. No adjustment on Aug Ex date already declared.
The link below to Assoc press article is incorrect— it should read that FE EXCEEDED earnings expectations —- 2nd quarter non gaap earnings were $0.62 per share which exceeded the $0.53 per share as forecast by analysts—-this article should have been proof read before distributing and corrected asap.Otherwise all share holders should enjoy a nice lift in share price today as well as thru many quarters going forward!FirstEnergy: 2Q Earnings Snapshothttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-2q-earnings-snapshot-212337493.html
FE makes new 52 week High today. Life is good for the longs.FE is the #1 performing electric Utility this year. Life is good for the longs.
One thing you know. Icahn is going to get FE sold to another utility. A quick buck is his MO.
Sub 40 is a good entry point. Safe company with a solid business model. Safe dividend coverage. This stock will recover as the COVID19 threat is reduced. Long FE!
FE is going to make record profits with this heat wave........If only a few people are involved today could be a great buying opportunity.........
Agree. Have to love these deals when they happen.
Look at a chart going back 6 months and it would like seem $37.00 has strong support......JMHO....
Why repeals wont happen. Its very time consuming when the government has to deal with the following: 1) Pandemic2) China vs America tensions3) Passing a new stimulus bill4) Dealing with record high Unemployment 5) Increasing violence in usa6) Protest BLM7) Reelection They have no time for this.
Anyone know if FE had reserved money in anticipation of fines?
Chump are selling off for a small 8% gain. Longs know this going to $40 for the real prize.
"As for analyst reaction, “we can no longer recommend the stock after the Department of Justice/FBI arrests and investigations announced yesterday,” Scotiabank analyst Andrew Weisel wrote in a commentary cited by Bloomberg.He cut his rating on the stock to sector perform from sector outperform and slashed his share-price target to $39 from $53.Weisel doesn’t see a “scenario in which shares outperform peers over the next 12 months.”KeyBanc analyst Sophie Karp cut her rating to sector weight from overweight.While it looks like the government doesn’t intend to indict FirstEnergy or its officials, the company’s risks are “reputational and political and, as such, hard to quantify,” she wrote in a report cited by Bloomberg.Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza wrote in a commentary that for now, “we believe FE will remain a value trap as investors steer clear of the uncertainty,” Bloomberg reports.He downgraded the company to neutral from buy, reducing his price target to $36 from $51.Barclays analyst Eric Beaumont downgraded FirstEnergy to equal weight from overweight, with a $37 price target."
Outlook - FirstEnergy ST: the RSI is oversold
this utility has all its bad news baked in....long term shareholders are buying on this year end tax loss cyber Dec sale....
The fact that DR is holding through this red market makes me believe it will get better
Hard to figure what this means they basically issued 20% of the previous float in new shares at a 10% discount to Fridays price and are going to unwind all the trading and book to become a fully regulated business then shore up the pension plan . While optimistic as a long term follower and shareholder ( CX was the first stock I ever bought which they acquired . I don't understand todays move as anything but a short squeeze and wonder if they can maintain the current dividend as in their agreement they must pay the new preferred at a rate they pay the common and it will dillute as it is a mandatory convert . Basically current shareholders paid a 10 % discount and some cash flow for a loan at the rate of the forward common dividend . Debt is being serviced not any expansion of income though the investment grade credit rating should be saved along with some interest moving forward along with risk when their done . It will be interesting to see what comes out as they wind down in terms of write offs should not be too bad Elliott is thorough on DD .
Carl Icahn own's 3.5 percent of First Energy....
short squeeze at close. Bottom priced in for petty 60 million dollar scandal unproven
