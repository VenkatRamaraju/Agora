"Got too excited too fast. Buy in the time being. Just wait, it'll go up again."
This pumping scheme will probably last until earnings. Enjoy while it lasts...

"Jonm, ya I agree I hate stocks that do nothing except for go up over the last 5 years"
- PODD is somewhat later in its valuation cycle compared with TNDM. It WILL be interesting going forward where TNDM seems to find a fair valuation with regards to current market share(+captureable mrkt. share) and revenues compared with PODD. GLTA

Valuation looks too high for this company. What is it that's stopping ABT and MDT to start with a competitive product soon? I have a feeling this stock is getting pumped by wall street only to dump it soon.

Don't think this is the top yet. Might pop above $200.
Trying to find any news or details into the possibility of a Dexcom integration. All news speaks of Horizon platform going to full clinical this year with a release date sometime in 2020
"I guess we will continue to limp into 25OCT until otherwise reflected by the share price. The market seems intent on not letting growth names breakout to new highs. No intention of selling on any dip here short term. $2B valuation is fair for $TNDM at this moment but I expect we contend with $PODD for comparable valuation by 2020. Revenue growth is what everyone expects...to what degree remains to be seen. I believe in a possibility of new markets unlocked in Canada and through UHC/$UNH... no stock is invincible but if the company in which you own equity is growing revenues, I suppose the share price will have to reflect that sooner or later. If you can afford to hold your shares, I would. If you can add more through the coming 18months, I would.To those that lost, you have Jeff Johnson at Baird to thank for the correction. I actually think Jeff Johnson’s “downgrade” will be seen as a good thing for long term valuations (assuming the market allows for that type of thing)"

"This stock has been a fairly lucrative investment for me, but reading the transcript of the CEO's presentation in Orlando last month, it struck me as a little slipshod. He seemed to meander from point to point and go over the same ground repeatedly. He obviously thinks he's good on his feet and can just wing this stuff. Somewhere in all of that, what I construe as the main point - the transition to an insulin pod which is manageable via a cellphone app - was lost."

What is your thoughts on Pod after the earnings report? Will the stock land at $230.00? Especially because of the partnership with dexcom?

"Curious what are people's thoughts about the P/E ratio of $PODD being around 609? 609 is WAY high, but I looked at its stock performance over YTD, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years at https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PODD/momentum/performance and its performance is stellar (doubling in less than 1 year, and increasing near 1,500% in 10 years. Or I guess a 609 P/E is ""priced for perfection"", which the stock performance over the past 10 years does seem ""perfect."" I bought some $PODD recently, but I'm concerned that if there's a recession that usually the stocks with very high P/E ratios tend to be the ones that % crash the furthest."
