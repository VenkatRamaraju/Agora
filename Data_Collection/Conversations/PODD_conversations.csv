"If there is any chance that antibiotic infusion or chemotherapy can be administered with an Omnipod (will take some tweaks obviously), that would seal the deal."
Last quarter this did the same thing on earnings date. Then went up 25$ a share over the next few weeks. I expect the same here.
"C-Bill, what do you think is a fair value for PODD? Factoring in growth."
Do you own shares of Insulet Corporation?
I became an investor 9 years ago when my daughter started using one at 11 years old. She has been totally independent since.
Ready for a big pop tomorrow!!
"Great, 5x+ so far, except I bough this in three UTMA accounts for my kids who only had 2000 to invest in it between them. 10k for them, plus the gains in Disney and Microsoft should make them happy, although now they think the stock market only goes up."
4-star analyst JP McKim from Piper Jaffray maintained a Buy on $PODD. JP has a 100% success rate
"I guess we will continue to limp into 25OCT until otherwise reflected by the share price. The market seems intent on not letting growth names breakout to new highs. No intention of selling on any dip here short term. $2B valuation is fair for $TNDM at this moment but I expect we contend with $PODD for comparable valuation by 2020. Revenue growth is what everyone expects...to what degree remains to be seen. I believe in a possibility of new markets unlocked in Canada and through UHC/$UNH... no stock is invincible but if the company in which you own equity is growing revenues, I suppose the share price will have to reflect that sooner or later. If you can afford to hold your shares, I would. If you can add more through the coming 18months, I would.To those that lost, you have Jeff Johnson at Baird to thank for the correction. I actually think Jeff Johnson’s “downgrade” will be seen as a good thing for long term valuations (assuming the market allows for that type of thing)"
Great Q
Should we short podd given the Oramed announcement FDA phase 3 progress about a pill for insulin replacing need for injection?? Would eliminate need for insulin pumps?
"$SENS will gain market share from $DXCM, $MDT, $PODD, just a matter of time, go $SENS"
"Well, guess it can fall now that I have bought and profit taking for the new year is in place. I'm an actual user so will see if it ran up too fast or can run much higher. Great product for me and now will see if great investment."
Thought I'd share that I'm seeing PODD ADs on YouTube lately. Not sure how this different from my SENS that I already own. But looks like this is much larger company.
Upgraded with price projection $213 share. Loving it.
Is anybody out there ?Hello ?
Don't think this is the top yet. Might pop above $200.
"I like this company, love the product but how do we justify 540 PE?"
"This piece of Krapp, should drop 50% their 1 billion in convertible debt, will greatly dilute shareholder equity, once exercised end of 2024"
"Woah, what caused this to increase almost 9% today? (not that I'm complaining )"
