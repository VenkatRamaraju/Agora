Holding up extremely well given earnings report. Where will it eventually bottom?
"Clever wording in their press release, .11% raise from 1st qtr 2017 divy."
.48 declared today. Stock ripping.
wow!
Newtek Business Services is up 5.79% to 27.23
"Hasta La Vista Baby, I'm Out."
NEWT is up 11.32% to 11.53
Tripled my position today.
"I currently own 52,000 shares and have been a huge supporter of Barry Sloane and have considered him as a genius with the company he has built. What he is thinking now I have no idea. He is turning the Co. into a bank. Banks are very unpopular, they are heveally regulated and restrained by the Fed, politicians are after them all the time and the Fed regulates their Dividend payouts to around 30% to 40% of profits. What this means to me is about a $250,000 stock loss tomorrow and an annual Dividend going from $160,000 to probably $60,000 if I'm lucky. The banks have had trouble since 2008 of meeting Fed. benchmarks, achieving share price appreciation and Dividend increases. I am deeply disappointed but I will wait and see. I'm not selling tomorrow with a $5 drop!"
"In the addendum, management is also proposing changing the ticker from NEWT to NEWK to better reflect the atomic bomb effects of structural changes on shareholder capital."
They are up slightly now. I'm not sure why there is all this bouncing. Earnings are scheduled to come out today. We'll have to wait and see.
I would like to see some current conversation on Newt's performance.I'm old and need some help on staying or selling.
i think this run up was a little too far too fast. Would imagine NEWT and broader market to selloff next week. I took some profits even though Im still incredibly bullish with the intention of buying a dip.
"Down 10 , 22 million share float. 10x22 = 220 million dollars shed today. So company valuation now 558 million instead of 778 Nice going Barry. How to ruin a stock in one day."
Sold mine this am. Cannot trust management. Total return about $0. I feel lucky.
"AGNC yields about 9% and pays monthly. At less than $16/share, and after recent sell-off, technically it is sitting on support established right after COVID crash."
totally irresponsible move by mgt....sell any company you do not trust....i no longer trust these people.
"One confused Company. Maybe there is a big deal on the horizon?November Stock Repurchase plan announced (200k shares). January Stock Offering of 1500k shares.November Note repurchase plan announced (7% yield, $4.8M). January increase revolving credit $50M to $75M."
NEWT Looking good for higher prices. Strong technical buying signal at 9trading. http://www.foxchart.com/share/678339037.png
NEWTL is down 14.63% to 17.50
Glad I bought the dip yesterday. It was on sale
"Hello, I've been following Newt since last January and sure wish I had gotten in but......any comments on room to grow from this SP? Can it continue? why or why not? Thanks.Dave"
"AS the worst investor I know, me, I continue to be pleased to have found Newt. Seems like on days like today, others are also happy and new blood finds the NEWT. Redman"
NEWTL is up 16.45% to 20.96
"Yawn. Current back to where we were last week, that's all."
Newtek Business Services is down 14.96% to 15.01
Call the deal off and take a one time hit..Deal will destroy stock for next five years !
"In the long run this change might be beneficial to the stockholders. But in the meantime all the yield investors are bailing, many at a huge loss. It's too late to bail now so I'll ride the big divs until later in the year when hopefully it begins to recover a bit. I got close to 2 bucks for $25 Puts, If I get stuck with the shares I've cut my BE in half and if not, I've cut $2 off the loss."
Newtek Business Services is up 5.24% to 33.44
Did they cut their dividend?
NEWTL is up 6.61% to 21.30
NEWT is down 6.28% to 11.72
nice dividend...
There's too much volume for it to be some random happenstance. Somebody either knows something or somebody made a big mistake.
"Just received my Special Meeting of Shareholders 8/2/2019 proxy. OMG they are proposing to sell up to 20% of common shares below NAV WITHOUT LIMIT. "".....there will be no limit on the percentage below NAV at which our Common Shares may be sold........"" This would be effective immediately upon affirmative vote of the shareholders. DILUTION ON STEROIDS If I am somehow misreading this, would someone more informed in this regard please reply? In the meantime, my sell stop's in!"
NEWT reached a 52 Week low at 15.57
"Impressive how well this is performing today on possibility of tapering and higher yields. None of my other financials are up as much as NEWT today. Lot of red in the markets, but financials and the dollar are firm."
"rida.morwa sent a message on #High Dividend Opportunities:NEWT was down today as much as 13% due to a downgrade by a firm called “Compass Point”. Frankly, “Compass Point” is a firm with no reputation and has no credibility as far as I am concerned. It probably created some panic among a few investors. Since NEWT is thinly traded, probably computer algorithms took over and made the pullback even deeper. I personally took advantage and doubled down on my position. The yield of 9.2% on NEWT is not going to last long. NEWT is set to hike their dividends soon again. I am not going to let this opportunity pass! @all"
has newt declared 4th quarter dividend yet?
Newtek Business Services is down 5.17% to 35.39

When is the dividend supposed to be credited in the brokerage account? I thought it was today (9/30).
NEWT is up 8.23% to $16.97
"So hey, I'm so confused about dividends. first let me ask If I buy a stock such as newt, does that automatically mean that I get a dividend payout on the next scheduled payout?"
"Investors looking for a high dividend altetnative to NEWT with significant potential for divudend increases and price appreciation can consider AGNC which is trading at about $16 (just above support after a significant sell off), ans has a consensus target of over $18.

"Is it possible that Management foresee Inflation and high Interest rates coming. And Banks usually do very well in that type of environment. Just wondering.... Given that NEWT is my largest position, I do not like the move, and will vote against it."
Newtek Business Services is up 5.72% to 17.55

NEWT is down 4.99% to 15.60
"Sloane stated on Conference call AUGUST 11, 2021. Today is DAY 41. So we should hear something very soon.So approximately 30 days to 45 days, we hope to give some additional transparency and forecast a dividend for Q1 2022. Going to slide number 4, 2021 key metrics, we've clearly positioned ourselves for a midpoint dividend of $3.15 for the year. That will be a 53% increase over the year prior."
"I must say, if you listened to the presentation this morning and look at the slide deck, the plan is all laid out there. It can be found on NewTeks investor relations website. Barry made many good comments that have me believing he sees what is best for his company."
Why wouldn't they need shareholders approval to make a 180 degree change like? We shareholders own the company after all!!How can a few knuckleheads be allowed pull the rug out like this?Serious question.
NEWT is up 11.90% to 12.32
I plan to contact investor relations tomorrow on promised 30-45 update. We are past that end date I post anything I find out
I feel optimistic about this company... What do u feel
Did the divi drop from $.44 to $.40?
"NEWT management and their ability to quickly pick up the loans authorized by the new legislation. That's the key. Of course the economy and the success of the medical community, both the caretakers and the researchers will be critical too. The troubles for the health care workers are heartbreaking and the number of deaths from the virus is too. We were so ill-prepared its a scandal, if not a crime, and our January response from POTUS was to go off and play golf."
I see lawsuits…….this type of actions aren’t new……but the lawsuits will come.
This is crazy.....down 15% after hours on news of an acquisition? SMH...
"dividend declared for 1Q = $.401, as expected. They will track last year's payouts per quarter with a 4Q increase to $.51 per share. Those that don't do any DD and don't know how they have paid their dividend in the past will panic and sell when they see the 1Q dividend is $.10 lower than the 4Q/2018. Great buying opportunity."
So very nice!!!
Would love to buy into this stock at 17
Newtek Cut to Underperform From Market Perform by Raymond James9:17 AM ET 1/8/20
"Entering a worst recession than 2008, did anyone notice NEWT SBA delinquencies rose from ~2% 2Q18 to ~8% 4Q19, a 4X when volume up YOY? Usually, ""denominator effect"" masquerades out-of-control finco pumping volume for gain-on-sale income but this is alarming. As a result, NEWT has issues with SBA OCRM division. Most of downdraft today was due to ETF/retail selling but sadly NEWT red flag of 4X DQ decline bull will result in SBA enforcement action/shutoff of SBA gain-on-sale income"
NEWT is down 4.93% to 18.70
"About 10 days ago CEO said loan referrals are up 800%...Gov't stimulus virtually eliminates increase in loan losses for next 2 qtrs. By law, 90% of profits MUST be distributed...unless there is something in stimulus package that changes that. NEWT must pay a dividend. I for 1 cannot see how a company that was and most probably continues to do most of their volume in SBA loans that were 80% government guaranteed, now going to have Gov't paying principal and interest payments for the next 6 months on existing SBA loans and 100% guaranteed for the next 6 months on new loans, have a major decrease in earnings with referrals increasing substantially...I don't think the USGovt will default on their promise to pay principal and interest for the next 6 months..if there is a negative, selling the loans at a greater ""margin"" might be a minor issue, but should e offset by larger volume with no losses...that's my thoughts...maybe time to buy more?"
What happened to the normal chat room and where did all the posts go to?

NEWTL is down 12.42% to 21.15
"How are dividends paid, monthly or quarterly"
"NEWT did not reduce the dividend rather they typically have employed a base dividend that grows over the course the year at each quarter and also may include a special/extra dividend paid late in the year. As someone (poorly) explained below, the YOY dividend already announced for MAR/2020 is HIGHER by 10% than MAR/2019. And this is the initial dividend of the year (which typically grows during each year)."
read my post from 1 year ago..numbers have not changed
"""The best way to rob a bank is to own one"" was the title of William K. Black's 1998 college thesis at the University of California, Irvine, and also the title of Black's 2005 book."
The stock is rolling over on serious volume today. I sold last week when it was struggling to move higher after owning it for over 2 years. Its done well but its trading 30% over NAV and its just gotten beyond fully valued. I'm back if it trends down around $18 or so.

"I bought a 1000 shares today at 14, I do plan on buying more but will wait until after earning announcement."
As a large shareholder I listened to Barry's conference call and slideshow presentation and am now 100% behind their plan moving forward. I still view him as a genius after his explanation and deem his proposal as the best long term strategy to maximize share holder value. Presently as a BDC they're only allowed to leverage themselves 2 to 1 without doing another stock offering to raise additional capital for lending thus diluting shareholder value. As a bank they can leverage 10 to 1 and also use low cost deposits for lending instead of doing a stock offering. Cost of Capital should be around 1.8% as opposed to 3.8% now. The stock will also trade at a higher premium as a bank as opposed to a BDC. They will operate as a Fintec as opposed to a traditional bank with many physical locations thus their cost structure will be much lower increasing return on capital. Barry also plans on marketing their Fintec model to other traditional banks adding additional value. He stated that the Dividend would stay in place and continue to be quite attractive going forward. One additional item is along with putting his reputation on the line with this strategic move he put his money where his mouth is. I'm not certain but I believe he has over 8 million shares which gave him an approximate paper loss yesterday of over 80 million!
should I be long on this stock? Do they consistently pay their dividends? Seems like a nice investment doesn't really fluctuate too far
NEWT is down 6.54% to 14.30
why?
"""To better serve are customers'"" Where does he expect the dividend to go ?"
"abad March 22, Monday is earnings call.NEWT is poised fro a good report and a good 6-12 months future. Based on what is going on in the nation. I expect a range of value beaten 27-32 and expect an increase in dividend. Let us see what news for NEWT March 22 brings to us."

"3Q dividend announcement is due at any time (last on 5/11). We already know it will be significantly higher than Q2's .42 dividend, perhaps REALLY higher. They've been clicking on all cylinders this year. I'm guessing at least .49-.50 cents, about 20% higher than previous."
awesome news on another divvy hike
NEWT reached a 52 Week low at 11.77
What's the opinion on the proxy that permits management to sell all of their at up to 20% less than current market price?
Newtek Business Services Corp is up 4.98% to 35.00
Newt does rock.
"Looking at the bright side... It seems that my RMD payment for 2022 is going to be much lower that I had expected, thanks to NEWT. :) My vote for converting out of BDC is: NO!!! But, while waiting I instructed my broker to replace my reinvest dividends position to cash."
NEWTZ reached an all time high at 27.67
I will add more in this stock next week hopefully... It is good to stay at this price for a while
dropped 5.7 percent to $19.52. Raymond James downgraded Newtek Business Services from Outperform to Market Perform. That means they want the price down so they can buy more. This is my biggest position. I had an account at Raymond James 10 years ago and lost 40% of it's value in 6 months in what were suppose to be safe investments.
.90 divvy declared for Q3. $1.20 Non GAAP NII.....Blowout.
Definitely climbing back.
Sounds like a 3-4yr plan. Likely many more bank aquisitions coming. It's a plan for a buyout of the company down the road.
"what's going on? any thoughts? I was up 40% a month or so ago, now only up 15%... everyday down, down, down."
"Smart move,you will very satisfied with a rising share price and increasing dividend."
NEWT is down 4.98% to 21.00
Was waiting for another good entry point. think I missed it at $15.50. I think I'll sell something else and buy more here 
question ? if the high for the day Friday was 15.96 and the close was 15.90 why was dividend paid at 15.98 per share?
Seems like the drop was an overreaction to X div date. No real reason for it otherwise.
"Will be voting NO on all mgt request...compensation , directors etc. If I'm still around ..looking now for another BDC with 8+% yield.Not sure we'll have say on this move as it's a buy out not a merger.Need to flood IR with our dislike for this out the Blue change."

Does rising interest rates and a slowing economy because of rising rates hurt this co? Are people selling because of rising rates?

"yikes...broke thru the 200 ... just 750 shares, but im going to the sidelines.. im a trend follower"
If i wanted a company like Live Oak bankshares I would have bought it....what I want and what i thought i had was a dividend paying BDC....they should be sued for misleading shareholders and changing their entire business model without notice...many retirees like myself bought this for income....now they change their company to a bank...why not an oil company? Crooks....

anyone know why the stock jump for the 17s to the 19s?
"Trying to figure out this price slide? Cannot see how this guaranteed stimulus plan will not put a great amount of profit into NEWT? Couldn't their dividend guidance be one of ""it's going to be higher?"" Folks taking down newt to gather shares doesn't seem like a reasonable explanation either, just wondering."
This downward price action today is typical before earnings tomorrow. Buy at end of day.
Newt has enjoyed a couple of outsize increase days on high daily volumes. Appears someone is accumulating.
"Note that NEWT has exceeded my original forecast of 22-26 as it has steadily climbed to 26.5. expect a leveling off with a yearly dividend which approaches $2,50 in the near future Excellent business operation for loan placements."
"Is this HUGE DROP today (4.62%) just because an institution closed out a holding, or what. Anyone know?"
"Well, after dropping to as low as 24.07 today, NEWT started rising to 25.77. I bought a total of 1000 shares today, already some a few to take profit. This one was oversold today and I won't be surprised it would return to around $30 in 2-4 weeks."

"ArtieRight after dividend, stock started moving down.... Why? Someone needed money.... Nervousness stock moving too fast...Interest rates rising with a perception business slowing.... Definitely NG for NEWT....None of us on the bottom rung knows.... Should become apparent soon....Just shows you the company just confirmed $1.80 for the year....I own a lot of stock since 9/11.... I was at a business presentation of a # of companies at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel that fateful day!NEWT was my bet (what a day!!!). Very impressed with Barry Sloan....Good luck to us...................................."
My guess is every mutual fund will want to buy NEWT when they converting to bank holding company based on their earnings.
"I was just about to purchase NEWT yesterday and, of course, I did not! Just as surprised as the rest of you by today’s move. Is it just a matter of someone wanting to buy in regardless of order fill? Or is there something in the works?"
Down 12% but I can’t find any news that would account for the drop.

I don't see how this is going to benefit shareholders. I read the spin but obviously the market isn't buying it. This reminds me of when the CEO of HTGC wanted to change that BDC from being internally to externally managed. That was beaten back by the major share holders but it took years for the stock price to recover. I think this is a sad day for the small retail investors.

Nice move up. I have a sense with the dividend increase this will steadily move up.Thoughts?
This feels like the buy of a lifetime w/ SBA7(a) book fully insured for 6 months + fee/ servicing income on PPP program. Looks like large insider buys from Barry and team to support. What am i missing here?
I just bought stock today. Since it was the ex-dividend date will I be paid dividends next time around?
"Now that I have read more about the FBI action, this is probably a nothing but a good opportunity to get into Newt at a good price."
Surprised not much of a conversation about becoming a bank holding company. I have a miinor position. Thankfully I guess given the stock price reaction
Government loan guaranty program is a home run for NEWT...guaranteed 6 month principal and interest payments on existing SBA Loans and 100% guarantee on new loans. read press release.
Swing play baby

Should be 22-25 in near future with excellent dividends.""Barry Sloane, President, Chairman and CEO said, “We greatly appreciate the opportunity to service independent business owners across the U.S., and we are currently submitting first- and second-draw PPP loan applications to the SBA on behalf of our customers. We appreciate the SBA designating NSBF in the first lender group, which will assist our borrowers in having priority in their receipt of their SBA loan (E-Tran)"""

Well....Barry never ceases to amaze me. He is a very detailed guy so it doesn't surprise me he came out with a addendum today for further clarity. Based on his 2022 projections I guestimate the dividend to start on completion of the merger to be around .60 annually. A couple side notes - as Apple always does Barry's projections are always conservative and we usually get an upside surprise each quarter - not to put any pressure on him of course. Another side note is once becoming a bank there should be a lot of buying pressure on the stock since they will have to be added to indexes and they will qualify for a lot more institutional funds. BDC's are limited when it comes to institutions.
Well gosh. This sure looks like the place we should all average down. Multiple bottom at the low of the year... Any takers?
Because some people think the divi was cut and it was not. see comments below. Progressive divi raise during the year is typical and the company's announced divi projection for 2020 is$2.19 pef share or above 10% annually. See 2019 payout for reference.
NEWT is down 14.96% to 15.01
"If people wanted to own a bank, they would already own one....and one with a proven track record and established dividend history. These knuckleheads are hiring one bank guy, not even a former ceo, and converting from a BDC to a an infant bank. Quite a leap of faith that these guys could outperform real bank, much less build something to weather banking cycles. A fool and other people’s money. I’m sure management will protect themselves with big salaries, bonuses, parachutes, cheap options, etc. but letting shareholders bear all the risk."
This is a way overblown sell off. There's a few investors here talking about selling on the absolute worst day. The market always overshoots in both directions on near term news. Hold your positions collect the rest of 2021 dividends and sell out of your positions at the end of this year or beginning of next depending on your taxable gain or loss. I wouldn't be surprised if we are above 30 again by the end of the week.
Full year 2018 guidance up to $1.70 from $1.64 in 2017. Good start with 1st qtr of .40.
In 3 years this stock has almost doubled and pays 10% dividend? Why do not more people own it? Glad I do. Redman

"The NAV at 12-31-19 was $15.70...presently trading below NAV / BV...this is OVERSOLD BIGTIME.....SMART MONEY WILL SEE THIS. GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY,although there are plenty of uneducated investors...Be Patient and the price will rebound....as approximately 80% of the loans are SBA loans and guaranteed...the downside is limited."
NEWT is up 5.26% to 10.80
"I sold NEWT a while ago because I was uncomfortable with their portfolio of investments going forward. It looks like management feels this is a good time to reposition the company to protect shareholders long term. Given the press release, it looks like things are fine short term and they have given themselves a long runway to transition and refocus the company."
"Raymond James playing games again, downgraded to underperform. I doubled down this morning. Their analyst history is less than stellar."
NEWT is up 5.90% to 14.00
I've owned newt for about 7 years and am very glad to have had the opportunity to pick up more shares on sale. I love the dividends which buys me even more shares

Their ppp loan department is a mess. Been trying to withdraw my application for weeks. Does anyone know who to contact for action?
"So let me get this straight, this guy Barry decided to turn his company into a bank when it isn’t a bank?"
"They buy a bank with ONE location, so its just a store front. And they just get a downgrade from Raymond James."
Do they pay a quarterly div?
NEWT is up 6.31% to 10.36
So who here feels this stock is going to take of soon with the thought of doing more gov. small business loans? I loaded up more shares a few days ago in preparation for this.
Strange they announced 3rd quarter divy before the 2nd quarter divy pays and the 2nd qtr earning call. Anyone here know anything?
BDC's and REIT's usually trade with a yield around 6%. At $1.80 payout this stock should trade at $30. It as been way undervalued for a long time. Maybe institutions are just now catching on to this issue (being the stock I mean).
Newtek Business Services is up 5.39% to 35.40
NEWTL is down 12.24% to 19.00
Any ideas which BDC folks might be buying with the money leaving NEWT?
no news and 1.8 up with double the average volume. Is it buyout or what
I love making solid buys the day before it moves on up
So what happened to make it jump so high.
"After reading some articles online I am now an expert. NEWT is transitioning from a Business Development Company (BDC) to a Bank Holding Company (BHC). These are legalise terms of how an organization exists and operates. As a BHC, NEWT can be more involved in different businesses while spreading their overall risk across the different endeavors. BDCs like REITs must return a high percentage of their profits to shareholders per the law. Not so with BHCs. So although mgmt said they intend to pay the full 2021 dividend guidance, the dividend will likely get cut starting in 2022.....which is also probably the time their BHC status will be approved the Federal Reserve. Mgmt will stay the same and it seems these smart people continue to maximize all the avenues to be successful in the highly regulated business world. So now NEWT in the future will be able to reinvest the money that always goes towards dividends back into developing businesses that they oversee. NEWT has seen great growth and returns as evidenced by their stock's increase. So to me, this transition to a BHC allows them more potential to develop, grow and have even larger positive returns to the shareholders. The problem is this is likely years down the road and investors want money now. So, will investors sell until NEWT is a successful BHC? Totally stinks bc it seemed what NEWT was doing as a BDC was a good thing and now they are taking a step back to take two steps forward. So I say all this bc I lost 15% of my portfolio tonight in after hours trading. Will the stock drop more in the days to come or do these business restructuring moves bounce back quickly??"
What is the NAV? Anyone know?
Nice DIV better SNACKING.......
"This is why when the stock gains after initial buy, you should sell enough to get back your initial investment. Shares I own now are just leftovers after initial invest was paid back and moved on somewhere else. Dividends are nice and who knows what the price may do. This could be a good long term investment for the youngsters out there."
Newtek Business Services is up 5.08% to 16.74
Newtek Business Services is up 13.07% to 17.73
AS a BDC I think they got tired of returning 90% of the income to the shareholders. No way will any commercial bank pay that dividend.
So what is it. NEWT owns them or not ? What is the connection?
NEWT is solid for the next 6-9 months and dividend should be fine at current level for at least 3 payments.
Will be interested again in $16-18 range.
Glad I bought the dip a few weeks back. I always watch for the panic selling and it's profitable.
"where do you think it will stabilize in the near to 6 months out? any estimate how long the conversion takes? what happens to the loans already made, which were the attraction we all had to invest in the first place?"
Newtek Business Services is up 5.90% to 14.00
What about a class action lawsuit?
"(NASDAQ: NEWT), an internally managed business development company (“BDC”), today announced that its Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2020 cash dividend of $0.56(1) per share, which is payable on July 31, 2020 to shareholders of record as of July 15, 2020"
Let’s it 22 today
Divvy announcement around 8/11. I expect about 85-95 cents for Q3 based on the midpoint of their last guidance. They're seldom wrong.
