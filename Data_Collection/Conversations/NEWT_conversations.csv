My guess is every mutual fund will want to buy NEWT when they converting to bank holding company based on their earnings.
"About 10 days ago CEO said loan referrals are up 800%...Gov't stimulus virtually eliminates increase in loan losses for next 2 qtrs. By law, 90% of profits MUST be distributed...unless there is something in stimulus package that changes that. NEWT must pay a dividend. I for 1 cannot see how a company that was and most probably continues to do most of their volume in SBA loans that were 80% government guaranteed, now going to have Gov't paying principal and interest payments for the next 6 months on existing SBA loans and 100% guaranteed for the next 6 months on new loans, have a major decrease in earnings with referrals increasing substantially...I don't think the USGovt will default on their promise to pay principal and interest for the next 6 months..if there is a negative, selling the loans at a greater ""margin"" might be a minor issue, but should e offset by larger volume with no losses...that's my thoughts...maybe time to buy more?"
Why the big drop and sell off at the end of the day?
"(NASDAQ: NEWT), an internally managed business development company (“BDC”), today announced that its Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2020 cash dividend of $0.56(1) per share, which is payable on July 31, 2020 to shareholders of record as of July 15, 2020"
"From Seeking Alpha: Newtek Business Services (NASDAQ:NEWT) agrees to acquire National Bank of New York City, a nationally chartered bank with ~$204M in total assets and $36.5M in Tier 1 capital (each as of June 30, 2021) for $20M in cash, as part of its plan to reposition Newtek as a bank holding company. The company expects the acquisition to clos in about six to 12 months. The deal is subject to approval by federal banking regulators and the U.S. Small Business Administration/ Newtek shareholders will vote on withdrawing Newtek's election as a business development company. The company reaffirms its 2021 annual dividend of $3.00-3.30 per share. Conference call on Aug. 3 at 7:30 AM ET.The key is the sentence above the last one."
"Impressive how well this is performing today on possibility of tapering and higher yields. None of my other financials are up as much as NEWT today. Lot of red in the markets, but financials and the dollar are firm."
"I currently own 52,000 shares and have been a huge supporter of Barry Sloane and have considered him as a genius with the company he has built. What he is thinking now I have no idea. He is turning the Co. into a bank. Banks are very unpopular, they are heveally regulated and restrained by the Fed, politicians are after them all the time and the Fed regulates their Dividend payouts to around 30% to 40% of profits. What this means to me is about a $250,000 stock loss tomorrow and an annual Dividend going from $160,000 to probably $60,000 if I'm lucky. The banks have had trouble since 2008 of meeting Fed. benchmarks, achieving share price appreciation and Dividend increases. I am deeply disappointed but I will wait and see. I'm not selling tomorrow with a $5 drop!"
Do they pay a quarterly div?
Upped the 4thQ div to $1.05 share.
"Sloane stated on Conference call AUGUST 11, 2021. Today is DAY 41. So we should hear something very soon.So approximately 30 days to 45 days, we hope to give some additional transparency and forecast a dividend for Q1 2022. Going to slide number 4, 2021 key metrics, we've clearly positioned ourselves for a midpoint dividend of $3.15 for the year. That will be a 53% increase over the year prior."
I plan to contact investor relations tomorrow on promised 30-45 update. We are past that end date I post anything I find out
"Investment Summary Newtek Business Services Corp. has a differentiated BDC model Newtek is an internally managed BDC; does not pay a 4% management fee to an external manager Portfolio companies are wholly owned, most for over 10 years Portfolio company dividends tend to be less sensitive to credit risk, interest rates and inflation, and couldpotentially benefit with such increases Forecast paying an annual cash dividend of $1.84 per share in 2019 Proven track record; Established in 1998; publically traded since September 2000 Over 15-year lending history through multiple lending cycles; great depth and breadth of experience NSBF does not purchase repackaged loans; instead, originates on a true retail basis leading to strongcredit quality and loan performance Small balance, industry and geographically diversified portfolio of 1,844 loans with an average loan size ofapproximately $181K of the average unguaranteed retained loan balance Floating rate notes without a cap, tied to Prime and with a quarterly rate adjust Management’s interests aligned with shareholders; management and Board combined own approximately6.3% of outstanding shares as of September 30, 2018 No derivative securities in BDC; No SBIC leverage; Do not invest in CDOs or loans with equity kickers,No 2nd lien or mezzanine financing as a business line No direct lending exposure to oil and gas industry"
I don't see how this is going to benefit shareholders. I read the spin but obviously the market isn't buying it. This reminds me of when the CEO of HTGC wanted to change that BDC from being internally to externally managed. That was beaten back by the major share holders but it took years for the stock price to recover. I think this is a sad day for the small retail investors.
awesome news on another divvy hike
Seems like the drop was an overreaction to X div date. No real reason for it otherwise.
Glad I bought the dip a few weeks back. I always watch for the panic selling and it's profitable.
Newt ex-divvy date 17 Dec 1.05
Definitely climbing back.
.90 divvy declared for Q3. $1.20 Non GAAP NII.....Blowout.
"After reading some articles online I am now an expert. NEWT is transitioning from a Business Development Company (BDC) to a Bank Holding Company (BHC). These are legalise terms of how an organization exists and operates. As a BHC, NEWT can be more involved in different businesses while spreading their overall risk across the different endeavors. BDCs like REITs must return a high percentage of their profits to shareholders per the law. Not so with BHCs. So although mgmt said they intend to pay the full 2021 dividend guidance, the dividend will likely get cut starting in 2022.....which is also probably the time their BHC status will be approved the Federal Reserve. Mgmt will stay the same and it seems these smart people continue to maximize all the avenues to be successful in the highly regulated business world. So now NEWT in the future will be able to reinvest the money that always goes towards dividends back into developing businesses that they oversee. NEWT has seen great growth and returns as evidenced by their stock's increase. So to me, this transition to a BHC allows them more potential to develop, grow and have even larger positive returns to the shareholders. The problem is this is likely years down the road and investors want money now. So, will investors sell until NEWT is a successful BHC? Totally stinks bc it seemed what NEWT was doing as a BDC was a good thing and now they are taking a step back to take two steps forward. So I say all this bc I lost 15% of my portfolio tonight in after hours trading. Will the stock drop more in the days to come or do these business restructuring moves bounce back quickly??"
