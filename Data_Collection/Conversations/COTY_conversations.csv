Not an event to sell over. Diluted share reporting doesn't increase. Buy the dip like I did.
institution ownership down from 50%to 35%.. comments???
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"What a wonderful leadership. For those who want to point that Dow and S&P are down, its because of the low CPI number which is a supposed to be a good thing for Coty as their supply chain should be cheape4r and people should have more money to spend on consumables. and oh btw Dow is down .91% and S&P is down .63% while coty is down 3.5%. That's 500% more downward pressure than S&P."
60% of this stock is owned by insiders... it really makes no senses for insider to tank this stock at this price level... it has show no signs of over $8... it didn't make senses at all!
"I mean, this is a gift for longs lol. They will reimplement the dividend soon the more shares you scoop = more future revenue + $12 is a virtual guarantee over the next year."
Wont be suprised that will head back to 4 usd….
Well I just bought the October 15 $9 calls. Hopefully we can at least get back to that.
Selling is over guys. Should be weekly green average till $10
Believe me or not this Q will be very much positive and Coty will head above 10$ !!!!!!Mark my words
"there was nothing to cheer about this one as individual investor for the past 6 months. The management didn't give damn about the stock price. I owned serval stocks which had second offering (CELH, NTLA..). Their management would protect the offering price and their stocks came back within one month to match the offer price as per agreement prior to the offering. Anyway, I trimmed down my positions to take some profits as most of my shares with average price $6.5 since last year."
I heard about COTY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Evil Award goes to.........Sue
The preferred don't usually effect the price action of the commons unless they dilute the holding of common as they are about to. Now had they made the conversion pending price of $15 this would be a win win for all parties but then they would have to wait for that price to get there. It would have created a possible confidence in the share prices and they would have eventually been able to cash out. This rush seems to to indicate an urgency. Why else would u convert ur preferred to below current common prices?
"Well, thanks to the huge share offering from KKR, here we are today…. Below $8 and heading to $6s if market continues to tank. All the momentum towards $10 was flushed away and unlikely we will see any reversal upwards so soon. The big $$$ players who are keeping this stock from hitting double digits must really be celebrating now.Has anyone ask Sue and the management what is their target share price and what they expect year to year? Or what is COTY worth in terms of share price?By the way…… seems like death cross is coming up soon if this keeps up and you guys should know what might likely happen next. :("
Sue working hard to keep to keep the prices depressed for JAB. She must be aiming for another round of bonus options
The slow bleed out is painful to watch
insiders getting fat
it is just worth shorting this
I have to resist the urge to look at this for six months.
"Brenden, your proposal of ""15-20$ by end of year easily"" is beyond dreaming.Do you understand basic math? the market cap is $7.292 billion. the proposed $15-20 is huge spread of $3.8 billion. @ $15, market cap = $11.5 billion@ $20, market cap = $15.3 billionThat's a difference of $3.8 billion (that's half the current market cap)Do you realize that even a growth stock is not likely to 100% in less than 4 months?I like to support mixster's suggestion that if you end up being wrong that you go away permanently from this board and if he is wrong that he/she should go away permanently. The race is on."
Coty is rebuilding it self and that in turn will increase our share price into the future. Coty is a strong hold. Do not allow the vulgarities of the Market to affect your investment in Coty.
Some one bought 1.8 million shares at 2:18 this afternoon..........Some one also bought 300 k shares just before noon...........
Seems like sell of did not stop yet !!!!!!
Buying for me now. Adding 2k shares
"Such a disappointment, that's all can say at this time."
"$COTY moving forward on solid footings, be patient and you shall be rewarded.Long and strong"
"IMO, this is a great opportunity to load up more or avg down for the ones who feel like they missed out at some point. Hold if you can't buy & stay the course. All should fare well if you are LONG. Why would you panic sell now when you could've sold a few weeks ago when it hit the 10's. It'll come around & up again sooner than you think. Matter of fact it already did inch up. GLTA, GLTA"
"I am tired of these people pushing these so called ""Guru Sites"" on our thread taking our time and space up. I just mute them but it still it is a pain in the rear when they have nothing to contribute to Coty Investors."
"ohhh,watch the baby traders take their usual 10cents,they should trade huggies !!"
"The fundamentals have not changed - In fact one could argue that they are set up to be even better. And while folks were filling this board up with negative comments, I’ve been quietly accumulating. Thank you for the cheap shares!"
"hopefully we're at the bottom of the trading range .... I think it's time to load up 5,000 shares"
"business good, but stock price is slow.. they need to get more large institutions buying in.... I am holding for long with 4% in my portfolios.. it is shame that I bought CRBU at $15 two months ago and it gave me more than 60% return while Coty is still dancing around in mid 9s... so I would believe it has good value to balance the portfolio for long run...but not for quick money maker in 6 to 9 months.."
"This stock is perpetually pinned between $7 to $9. Looks like it will hover here at this price for a while. And then IF and IF they do deliver good results next quarter, at the most they go to $9+. So what?s new really? After that it will probably repeat again by dropping back down on whatever ?lame? #$%$ Don?t forget that KKR and JAB still have substantial amount of shares/bonds (preferential or otherwise) and can/may do another round of huge offering or selling anytime. Who?s to stop them?$10 price level has now become a massive resistance level on the charts and am sure lots of selling will happen there since they have established that barrier in place now. Until the day it can break $10 convincingly and hold ground, I think it is too early for anyone to start rejoicing on empty optimism.Disappointment with this stock is simply an understatement.Just pray hard that this market won?t crash hard in the near future. Because if it does, it is gonna be ugly for all and more so for this stock in particular."

very strange day... good retailers' data and all cosmetics sectors are down.
"Sue hits payday. SEC filing yesterday for beneficial change in ownership. Cottage Holdco transferred 10m restricted class A shares to her. She may become the highest paid most successful Trans woman CEO in history. A lot of folks are counting on her- IMO, failure is not an option for her. Enjoy the ride and history in the making. "

"The KKR deal means it IS a dilute event but it has been known it would happen when the deal was made last year when the stock was at 4 dollars and the strike price was 6.25, if you look at the August 27th filing KKR converted all of the preferred shares for 150mm shares which means the shares outstanding will go to 920mm shares but they no longer have to pay back the debt of the preferred sand no longer have to pay the 90mm dollars a year which could go to pay off debt or maybe one day go to dividends to common shareholders. So, yes dilutive but not in the traditional sense of a secondary to raise cash for the company it is a preferred that is converted. Enterprise value basically will increase 400mm more or less from this transaction. Part of me think this is the price to pay for avoiding major issues, KKR helped the company avoid issues but did so at a steep price. Hopefully, we get that money back when wella stake gets sold for $2 to $3 billion of which I am certain half goes to pay debt and maybe some goes to buyback shares or start the dividend again, either way company is profitable now and will continue to be."
Was expecting 15$ but it feels impossible so 12$ is good price range to sell and forget about Coty
I believe this tree has been shaken just about as hard as it could be. We are either going back up sometime in the future or we will be stuck in limbo holding the bag. That is my reality check....
We have 5 weeks before the next ER. Catalysts to cause a run up into earnings are 1. Closing of the Wella deal with KKR 2. Brazil IPO 3. COTY Annual meeting updates. 4. Industry insights from competitors.
if they don't blow out earnings 6s make be in the cards on year end window dressing. I'm accumulating. 2022 should be a much better year for Coty.
"Don't buy coty till one week before earnings, Ceo and her accomplices are manipulating big short position."
"One of the best reopening trades, COTY, on sale. Screaming buy."
"They are going to try getting it to the $6s. Never say never. You will never know in this dirty game of share price manipulation and #$%$ dirty money dealings. I shudder to think if the few coming quarter earnings reports disappoints instead and fails to meet expectations somehow. It went to $7.50 pretty fast. And Sue and the company board of directors all keeping very quiet.And even if the earning reports are reasonably good, look how far the share price has already fallen?.. at the most it will only try to scratch the recent huge share price offering at $8.50. After that don?t be surprised to see it crumbling again. So basically we are all stuck at some losing no mans land?? the opportunity costs are huge given that there are other better performing company shares out there with better potential, even within the same beauty industry and sector. More so in some others."
I do not have any expectations for Coty in the next two or three weeks. But I expect Coty to at least hold above 8. Our time is just around the corner when they come out with more guidance and their quarterly report. At that time I will reassess my position and do what is necessary.
"Pre-covid share price is around $8-$9. With the reduced revenue, no reason it will go more than pre-covid share price."
Just added 6k shares. Dollar cost averaging over the next hour.
"For those of you who have said Sue has a vested interest in Coty and therefore faithful to the shareholders, you are only partially correct. She is not faithful to today's holders, rather those of 2025. Her options can not be exercised for 2.5 more years. By which time Coty will be mostly owned by JAB and that's when the prices will pump."
More mindless bashers on the board the more bullish i am on the stock
The problem I have with this arrangement with KKR is the price per share. Why so low? Should have been at least nine dollars.
I like the boosters because they good for my morale but not worth much.
So depressing to see this price action hopefully Q earnings will move us higher
"Coty pursues partial IPO of its Brazil business while retaining a controlling stake, which will help advance the company’s deleveraging agenda."
not worry much as long as they could hit results.. plus Holiday season is near..no panic
"As always, they will always find some ways to suppress the stock price of this company. $10 will now be a massive monster resistance level. Just when we all thought it was reversing to an uptrend after months and months of stagnated decline….. it is now being smacked down hard to kill off any and all momentum. Such coincidental timing indeed. Whatever it is…. The big $$$ market makers (aka manipulators) will always win.Some of you are really optimistic. I admire your resolute and positive belief but it will now take a long while for COTY to even make a run back to $10….. and to be honest, the general market seems ripe and prime for a crash anytime. That is gonna crush this stock further for sure.COTY better be beating expectations quarter after quarter henceforth or we will be seeing new lows soon instead for this year and next!"
Kylie baby is out of stock ! missus just tried to buy it
"Pathetic daily SP movement action. Like sitting on the bleachers waiting for a game to start and the players come to the field with a bad case of diarrhea and the game gets canceled. Holding this long for almost a year now. Thankfully, I'm holding at a low avg of 3.99. But then again tempted to sell as money making opportunities are being passed on due to this holding. Waiting for the upcoming ER to see if it'll move the needle enough back to mid 10's at least. A place where I didn't even think of selling when it hit a few weeks ago because I believed in the company and their future guidance. But this price manipulation is getting old already. Not even dividends to wet your whistle somewhat while it recovers. At the end of the day, the stockholders should be taken care of, Sue. Remember that. Clearly, we're still here...show us what you've got."
Time to buy
anemic volume which is a good thing on a down day!
"If the price set was $8..53 to the public, we never touched $8.50. How does that work? Surely most of this was KKR"

Coty Sells 9% Stake in Wella to KKR in $426.5 Million Deal
$9.48 at 12:30pm EST. (we just went positive .37%). Sit back and let the market do its thing today.Its Friday... relaaaxxxx
"Who’s ready for the $7s? Then next earnings, IF and only IF they can deliver good results, it probably goes back to high $8s and $9s again as per before. Same as where we all were before sometime this year and then something will happen again, and it goes back down. You can practically see what has been happening….Worst case if the shares are gonna pick up pace upwards, KKR (or JAB) still have a boat load to do another share offering….. ouch!"
Girls/women are looking a lot prettier these days equals buy the dip.
sold half my shares today and bought Skin....
Warning  Don’t walk into the options trap . COTY ready to take the next leg higher 
8/30/21D. A. Davidson Raises Price Coty Inc. (COTY) $10.00 -> $10.50
Well just got my COTY proxy. Is Sue worth $3.52m a year?
The market is forward looking and the future is brighter than ever for COTY. Even a fifth grader can see that their performance and delivery over the past 4 quarters was outstanding despite the headwinds. What’s left are the many tailwinds that exist and will take their conservative 2022 outlook way over the expectation. I predict many analysts upgrades coming out the near future. Great ER call yesterday and excellent analyst questions. GL Longs 
"It looks like a bargain basement sale maybe getting into high gear thanks to Sue, JAB and KKR. If they want to keep on depressing Coty's share price I am going to load my truck up with more cheap shares of Coty and will cash in later. Make my day Coty! Because when the going gets tough, the tough get going!"
"COTY is highly correlated to more people getting out and about, ie., the reopening. Much of that is in front of us. No complaints about mgmt. Buy."
In my opinion if you invested in under eight you should be great. If you invested over eight you are going to have to wait. Either way is Ok!
"buy 1 week before earnings, sell immediately after it announces,,thats it and fire ceo not American."
"I don't feel so bad after all Coty did stay above 8 USD. I am not complaining. But I do hope it gets better later. An old adage or saying "" You Can't Lose if you don't Sell"""
Coty has a lot of brand names. A few are neither popular nor profitable. They could be dropped or sold off. The Wella deal will raise some cash and could prove to be a good move.
Chinese stocks have been crushed last 3months. yet I'm thinking they will easily outperform Coty. Short or long term.
glad that I only have 5000 left and will exit out once it reaches long term cap next month
S&P Global RatingsCoty Inc. Ratings Affirmed On Modest DebtReduction; Outlook Remains Negativehttps://www.jabholco.com/section/press-releasesNot so good news):
The street gives KKR way to much clout. They're just another fast money investor. Nothing has changed otherwise. the reopening is alive and well. Buy.
If you want to prevent the shorts from shorting just put in a sell order for the future and that will lock up your shares and they will not be able to short the amount of shares that you have.
If you see down as up and up as down you are experiencing what is going on in our Nation today. So my question is will politics affect our Coty investment? If so! How?
Next stop if not good Q report we will see 6 range
Sham-Wow! over 12 million shares traded today. And looking better! A couple more days like this and I will be very satisfied. GLTA here....
Strap in! We in for a roller coaster ride today. Enjoy and Good Luck.

our fate for a period of 3 months will be decided today
It didn't have any new life in this stock so far with market up or down
great job on Sue and Coty management. they just earned my long term commitment
"Highly undervalued. Sue nabi and team have done a wonderful job since she joined on as CEO a little over a year ago. Look at what she did with Loreal, very impressive"
Watch this close in the green. Sell calls and buy puts for insurance if your thinking this will tank. I'm thinking gift they're telling us the 8.53 price how nice is that. Kinda like showing your hand to the other players. Check out the option action for additional insight. Interesting indeed.
15-20$ by end of year easily. Management teams very strong here
Won’t go much past 8.5 until tomorrow’s 8.5 calls expire.
"Ever since COTY crashed its share price by over a dollar back on Sept. 8, from $9.29 down to just above $8.10, buyers have been skittish about buying here ........COTY-0.12%September 8, 2021In this article:COTY-0.12%Explore the topics mentioned in this articleNEW YORK, September 08, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY) (""Coty"") today announced the pricing of its previously-announced registered public secondary offering of 50,000,088 shares of Coty’s outstanding Class A common stock by KKR Rainbow Aggregator L.P. (""KKR""), at a price to the public of $8.53 per share."
did you see the volume today? 762% of the daily average. per marketwatch. 49 million shares vs. 6.4 million.
the price is as it was 6 months agoEverything is green only Coty is red.what's going on with this company ?
Wella has been a great cow to milk. Terrific deal and financial prudence on the part of COTY! 
"Considering they have been cash flow positive in this slow quarter, having a decent product margin, the increased volume due to the stronger upcoming season and market share gains should create another upwave when next quarter results will be out. Also not to forget the Kylie Cosmetics addition."
"If you have the cash, buy this dip. Another over reaction. Debt ceiling won’t be an issue despite what the media will say."
I see downside minimal risk Upside small possible gain in future. Maybe to$9 again
Uk easing its travel restrictions good for Coty
"Congrats to the management for being so loyal to their puppeteers, JAB!"

Final hour of the day was nice- strong close! 
"After this great deal with KKR is complete you’ll see a god move on this stock. Until then there holding the price, I’m thinking"
"Who knows what is really happening: This could be just an artificial dump! Or maybe with new, younger management KKR might buy more shares. Or maybe just more manipulation by the big boys. What ever it is. I am going to keep holding the proverbial bag because a friend once told me that I can't lose if I don't sell. Or what ever! LOL"
dead stock.. EL up 3% with huge DOW market gain
So 70 million shares traded last two days. Looks like a reset of share price. Up from here!!
"Honestly, I thought we'd be around 12 at least after a great ER. However, I know it will be soon enough and seeing a 14-15 SP EOY at the very least. Continuing to hold long without any hesitation until end of May 2022 at the very least and maybe longer after reassessing then. A no-brainer here with the great growth guidance & projected revenue that were released. GL longs."

Time to sell
messed up for sure...
buy before earnings
Such a bright and green day in the market and we are heading in red zone !!!! Amazing manipulation
"I just today took the time to listen to the entire earnings cc. I was very encouraged to hear how well each area of the business is performing. I think the 2022 forecast is a major low ball given the momentum that was reported across all segments of their business. The six target business plan is being followed exactly as laid out last year. I sense that the management team is turning the corner on credibility, which is very important before big money will be all in. This is starting to look like a real deal turnaround......2 more quarters of execution against the business plan and you are looking at major stock price increase. Thats my takeaway and my money is on the line."
Reddit and Rhood come to the rescue
"business model is good with growth... As long as it has growth and meet the earning, I am willing for long term and not worry about stock price much"

Thank you for the sale season.
Full reopening trade is now before us. The delta variant is losing strength. Sort of like IDA after landfall. Buy hard below $9.
Shorts will cover today. 12.50USD by EOD
Hmm lets stay on the topic. Why would kkr do this now. Well perhaps and lets assume they know a bit more than we do. There insiders after all. My take is there tired of the share price being manipulated as we all are and there fine with the 8.53. They still have a large position and there confident that the company brands are firing on all cylinders. They cut cost and are moving to on-line marketing strategies. This is panning out as sue pointed out in the conference call. So it's a SP price stabilizing move to do this now. That s my take anybody got a clue. Im long both shares and calls.
"We have some traction... ""Coty is now expecting first-quarter sales to grow by a high teens percentage."" And +13% gain on the day will bring attention from the broader retail market. This is what we needed to put COTY on the map. Will continue to get stronger from here..."
"this upcoming earning is very critical for Coty. At the least, it was for me to decide whether it is worth long time holding and whether the management is on the right path"
When will it get over $8.53 is the question.
"Awful undervalued. COTY is even doing better than pre Covid, strong forecast, should be $12 by now."
"I am longer term share holder holding 6000 shares for 14 months now. Although I am up since my original purchase, I am starting to wonder if there are deeper concerns with this company that only the big boys are privy too. I understand the manipulation but why manipulate a company for this long. Wondering if I should just cut ties and move on. I have current sells in at $12 and $16, 2000 shares for each one while letting the remaining 2000 shares to ride . I just don’t know if this company is healthy enough to get there. My only hope now is a strong Christmas season. Good luck to longs including me."
Hate to say this but Just wait when the general market takes a big dump…. This one may look and turn really ugly. They seem really determined to knock this down to mid $7s (and maybe $6s?). Guess no one from the company really cares or bothers about the share price nowadays. What is going on? Everything is green except this…….
Sue petting share holders
Looks to be forming a reverse head and shoulders pattern
When Coty looks like she is on the bottom and at its most bleakest point. Than that is when things start to move and change. Keep a close eye on Coty going forward because she is totally unpredictable and manipulated.
"Time for another round of bonus for Sue and the gang, Bravo!!! u have make JAB happy and share holders depressed."
this price and lack of momentum is sic
Sold 1/3 position on that pop. Not buying this move up
"Coty schedules an investor meeting on September 13th as the company intends to reaffirm its guidance, trends and strategic information that was discussed in the Company earnings press release."
"As I stated many times, coty will rise only on good reports. ONLY. now maybe IPO news. Each time good reports come out, more investors regain trust, or become interested to invest. I am here since april 2020. What I noticed, that after each good report, we get +2$-3$ per share. I see 10$ no problem. After next ER 12$ is possible. Then after one more maybe 15$ and then stabilise at 13-14$. That is 6 months from now. By 2022 we may have 12$, by summer 2022 we may have 15. Provided that no market correction and good reports. Agree?"
"This one needs to go up quick... there are lots of good investment opportunities.. I bought UPST and it went up 5 times within two month.... my point is that investor patience is limited and we would need to have some return within 3 month, 6 months and 1 year... check last year Nov, this year Feb price.. very disappointed so far... today, Dow jumps 500 points and it didn't move to $8"
Tailwinds for COTY1). Kylie’s launch in EU and next APAC2) Potential to be acquired with investment firms already inside COTY’s door such as KKR and JAB Holding (am into financial/acquisition firm and this is the first step in molding to sell the company)3) New CEO who has been in the Beauty industry unlike previous CEOs.4) Not fully recovered from Covid effects considering boom in the Beauty industry.
I beginning to think that Coty is holding up better than I expected. Anybody else think the same?
Shares will be devoured in short order. Smart buy here. Take that to the bank.
"did you notice the...wipe that buys the close and sells premarket every day, hurts the run!!"
"This stock is more volatile than my ex. Lots of day traders and shorts what's cool. Looking ahead to Nov earnings release...12$ is realistic. Anyhow, all the NKOTB , stay cool...don't sell this sort of stock if you are making losses now...you will be ok if you can hold till end Nov."

"TO ALL FELLOW COTY LONGS,It was a rough ride this past 3 months. I was tempted to sell in 8's, then tempted to sell in 7's last week. My conviction in this company prevailed and i held every single share I've accumulated over the past 18 months. I did not sell, I held tight. This ER was the big one, for many here it was make or break. We now have confirmation we are standing on solid ground with a future that is bright. GLTA and congrats."
After the sale KKR remains COTY 2nd largest share holder with 10.9%.
Welp apparently KKR thanks COTY is worth no more than $8.53 a share. COTY is pushing on a billion shares now. Annual shareholder meeting coming up in November I believe. Reverse split is going to have to be a topic of conversation soon.
"AMRS is coming after Coty. They’re not just a makeup company like COTY is, they are a synthetic biology company making clean products…and oh by the way…also selling their raw ingredients to COTY, L’Oréal, etc. Biossance is their brand and sold at Sephora, Target, etc. When you buy AMRS, you get great skin and beauty brands and a heck of a lot more too!"
Pete Najarian just said he is seeing monster call buying and he is in COTY too
"just curiously, which firm bought this stock from KKR with $8.52 offer price that is 6% down"
This is a non dilutive offering. No new shares are being issued. Stop freaking out
does anyone know whether the offering has completed? who or which institutions purchased those shares?
I am revising my vision for the stock price. Coty is a snail not a whale. But it is always darkest before the storm. I am still waiting because you will not lose if you don't sell. Not the best advice but that is how I see it for now.
"Okay, sp will drop to about 8.53 dollars because it is the offering price. There is nothing new that these offerings are below the market value to get them sold. I think this might really help Cotys sp in long run, because there is more shares to be traded. Lets see if it sp drops a lot more which I do not believe because fundamentals have not changed since er. Revenue is growing, costs are going down and demand is growing."

Do is up 225 pts and coty is in the red. u got to love how sue is screwing us over.
Was KKR the Brazilian IPO or were they part if the Brazilian IPO?
I sometimes wonder how much of an affect Options have on Coty's share price. It seem to be that they hold Coty back.
it would be great if we can maintain above $8 for this correction but i Doubt it.
Ok- I’m done. 18k shares added between $8.25 and $8.40. Going for a long dip in the pool. See y’all at the closing bell. GL longs 
A lot of people in this forum say about Sue and JAB. There must be something else with this stock though.
"No, no, vaccinations will ensure that the reopening continues. Buy."
here comes 8.65-8.7 as highs.
"How any of you think Sue deserves another option bonus for showing her loyalty to JAB by keeping the prices depressed? No worries that wont make her do anything favorable for the shareholders. He options will be like the others she was given, They can be cashed out in 2.5 years when JAB owns even more shares."
You know what really stinks is that the RSI and MACD are not looking good either. so probability of a recovery is only possible on good news. Which in my opinion would be a class action against the board of directors and Sue for conspiracy to keep share prices artificially depressed.
Strange whats reason for this drop again
If you like roller coaster rides we are on one. I see no reason one way or the other to panic. Enjoy if you stay good luck if you go.
"bought at 8.11, just sold at 8.40"
Morgan Stanley blew it on the secondary given today's pricing. Where's the SEC?
6m chart Looks fantastic. Now i feel Better when i sold that.
Does anybody have any thoughts on the Brazilian IPO. How that could affect Coty's bottom line.
A little surprised about the dip below $8. Holiday has already shipped so wonder if this is an omen of what to expect.
"It has become rather apparent that COTY shares continue to be sold by those who have received them recently by way of the WELLA agreement or whatever........For example, just this morning when the market opened over 110,000 shares were sold which shows that whomever sold them hadn't paid for them and/or have NO experience in trading stock.......That is because No-One would Sell 110K shares at the open with the futures ""up"" hundreds of points as they were today.!!!!!!!! There is buying going on, but the buying for now is being offset by that selling by those who know nothing other than they just want their money, particularly when you consider the share price was less than $3 in the last 52 weeks..... This selling will hopefully dry up by the end of Oct, and that's just a guess, including end of year tax-loss selling.........."

"I was just at my local CVS. The new merchandising looks terrific! They have also grown to 20 linear feet for Cover Girl and 8 linear feet for Sally Hanson. If you know anything about retail merchandising, it’s all about dollars per square foot. They would not have this kind of placement or shelf space if they were not selling or profitable for the retailer. Long and strong COTY "
"After the big price rise yesterday, it’s normal to see some profit taking today. I’m satisfied that Coty is making progress in all areas with regards to its turnaround, so I’m holding for the long term. One thing I’d like to know is when/if we can expect the dividend to return."
November 4th is Coty Share Holder Meeting. You can vote ahead of time if you have received their 10k in your E-Mail. I have already voted. Nothing earth shattering.
"When will u guys finally believe me??? Sue (JAB's puppet) plans to keep the prices depressed so that JAB can continue to accumulate. then in 2.5 yrs when the class action suit is far in the rear view mirror and Sue's options mature, then they will pump and sell their shares. That's what JAB has done historically."
"Painful junk to hold. We all got screwed by the huge share offering by KKR. That wiped out all positive momentum upwards when we were moving up towards challenging $10 levels again back then.As I said before, at the most if the next quarter earnings are truly ?great?, we will perhaps be lucky to see high $8s or Low $9s (that?s assuming the general market doesn?t crash) and then this can gets recycled and thrashed down again. KKR and JAB still have a boatload of shares to offload and can always launch another huge offering. What?s to stop either one of them? In any case, they and the other big players can still continue to manipulate it somehow. Looks like this stock is capped at $10. And may still get flushed down to $7s again. That is always possible if they end up with some #$%$ earnings report somehow.This year is truly wasted on this stock. I am not a happy shareholder. I still make money but at the cost of a lot of other better opportunities out there. At the end of the day, we retailers want to make $$$ too and not just the big players.Let?s be realistic with what has been going on with the share price for this year (till today it is still below the price of the huge share offering - #$%$ in view of the big market rally) and NOT be a silly ra-ra cheerleader here. I am not dissing anyone in particular but blind optimism can make one look silly. I already felt silly and angry myself for missing huge opportunities elsewhere!"
"After seeing the support at 7.75, I decided to jump in. Good news today. That's a lot of cash to be used for its operation temporarily. Let's go!"

Thank you for the cheap shares this morning. 
"Those that bought KKR's shares were not Coty type investors. They were fast traders, likely, and sold. Screaming buy under $8. Mark this post."
Mark my words. Once it go back to 9 i am out of that bs. Keep holding for more than a year with avg 5.0usd. So many opportunities run away Just due to fact that i was waiting for Q report every single time and do believe that gonna hold Above 10. I am fool.
"I see that the links with proof of allegation of class action against JAB and the links to the puppets they have put n the board were deleted. NP. for those of u who r interested in the truth, just google it."
Q earnings should be good due to no major lockdowns in the world and travel rebounding much faster!!! Lets wait again Q earnings this only way to move share price higher
Kylie baby out of stock already 
Ouchhhh what is reason of this drop ??????
PAAATHETIC. Let's just agree on that. Still will not sell below $12. Guess that means i will still be here for another few quarters? Hopefully they can move some major retail volume during holidays.
"$7.64 - $7.75 is big support level. It means, we will fly to the moon soon."

"This is very discouraging. When a stock that is down significantly over the last 2 months can't go up and stay up on very good news......well, that is a problem, a major problem......this stock could end up down for the day."

"Kylie Baby just launched today. Personal and skin care for babies and part of the COTY partnership. Absolutely brilliant!! BTW, she’s pregnant with child #2- the timing is perfect. Check it out Instagram. COTY ."
I wonder if this is enough to move Coty's stock up?
"How many of the folks making comments have worked in the beauty field before or are still in it? If so, how many of those have the pedigree of Sue Nabi? If you do, then quit your current job and get hired by Sue. She could use more great minds. Why is it that Sue left Loreal and took on the land of misfit fragrances at Coty? And, why is it that Sue has made a noticeable difference in only one year? Sue is that good. KKR is monetizing part of its Coty position. That is a good thing. It allows more investors into the mix and makes KKR less onerous to Coty. In the meantime, Sue just keeps coming....like the terminator. She will reinvigorate the name brands. She will create a new persona with the likes of Kylie K and others. Sit back and be patient. This is going to take some time.....but like anything worth doing....it's worth doing well."

"Market green COTY red a little, market red COTY red a lot. Bottom line is this isn't going to $10 until near next earnings call. I should have sold for the brief seconds it was over $10 this week."
COTY would be a cheap BO candidate for a bigger company but just don't know if a bigger company likes COTY's balance sheet?!?
"Coty has a lot of brand name products, some of which are not popular or profitable. Mgt should consider giving up a few of these brands to improve profitability. Getting some additional cash from the Wella deal may be a starting point."
I heard about COTY the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"after one week of up beating earnings, this one didn't do anything and I sold half of my positions before its secondary offer... so glad I did that... something very strange with this company...I will hold another half till end of this year to see what happens"
swing trading Coty was my best decision in my IRA.
Here comes the squeeze!
