Coty has a lot of brand names. A few are neither popular nor profitable. They could be dropped or sold off. The Wella deal will raise some cash and could prove to be a good move.
Won’t go much past 8.5 until tomorrow’s 8.5 calls expire.
"Coty is great opportunity.Was Sue right when she exercised options to buy nearly $ 100 million worth of stock? Sue Nabi acquired her massive stake when the stock was trading around $9.70.Coty is demonstrating clear evidence that its fortunes are improving.Folks, COTY has minimal risk downside now!As a part of consumer staples, it is the best inflation play.And of corse there is great upside potential through effective management and new management interventions.This is hedge fund down play before big ride.Downside moves are hedge funds game!(60.11% % of Shares Held by All Insider27.25% % of Shares Held by Institutions)"
Q earnings should be good due to no major lockdowns in the world and travel rebounding much faster!!! Lets wait again Q earnings this only way to move share price higher

14$ before earnings. mark my word.
"Those that bought KKR's shares were not Coty type investors. They were fast traders, likely, and sold. Screaming buy under $8. Mark this post."

Finally!
Was expecting 15$ but it feels impossible so 12$ is good price range to sell and forget about Coty
"Seems like the company is beefing up the balance sheet with paying down debt by raising capital. That goes to the bottom line. Makes the company more attractive and if 6 point plan works, things looking very up."

Over 17mil in volume that helps put a floor down for Coty. And their business execution was exceptional today.
Some one bought 1.8 million shares at 2:18 this afternoon..........Some one also bought 300 k shares just before noon...........
ULTA investor day tomorrow will guide the way higher. 
I am revising my vision for the stock price. Coty is a snail not a whale. But it is always darkest before the storm. I am still waiting because you will not lose if you don't sell. Not the best advice but that is how I see it for now.

Rick. No dummy would sell any shares prior to this month’s numbers. If you feel that way sell them all.
"hopefully we're at the bottom of the trading range .... I think it's time to load up 5,000 shares"
"The fundamentals have not changed - In fact one could argue that they are set up to be even better. And while folks were filling this board up with negative comments, I’ve been quietly accumulating. Thank you for the cheap shares!"
don't look at the shelves.. talk to the salespeople... Ask them what's selling.. What's in demand. vendors pay for shelf space.....
„Coty (COTY) Gains on Strength in Partnerships & Core Priorities„ —-> -3.11%. Really COTY gains on strength…. What a joke.
ghost stock... investors don't like what they see with the company selling office productive assets
"For those of you who have said Sue has a vested interest in Coty and therefore faithful to the shareholders, you are only partially correct. She is not faithful to today's holders, rather those of 2025. Her options can not be exercised for 2.5 more years. By which time Coty will be mostly owned by JAB and that's when the prices will pump."
I do not have any expectations for Coty in the next two or three weeks. But I expect Coty to at least hold above 8. Our time is just around the corner when they come out with more guidance and their quarterly report. At that time I will reassess my position and do what is necessary.
Fortune is built on disappointment. And there is a lot of disappointment here. And talk about over sold? Wow!
"After this great deal with KKR is complete you’ll see a god move on this stock. Until then there holding the price, I’m thinking"
The shake and bake continues. Although I am pleased with today's retracement.
November 4th is Coty Share Holder Meeting. You can vote ahead of time if you have received their 10k in your E-Mail. I have already voted. Nothing earth shattering.
oversold buyers.... couldn't hold the high for the day.... still most indicators r negative... if your a swing trader this has been a awesome stock.... buy hold at these levels....

No worries. JAB is probably having an emergency meeting with their puppet (sue) to figure out a way to sabotage the upgrade.

Hate to say this but Just wait when the general market takes a big dump…. This one may look and turn really ugly. They seem really determined to knock this down to mid $7s (and maybe $6s?). Guess no one from the company really cares or bothers about the share price nowadays. What is going on? Everything is green except this…….

Coty is bumping up against its fifty day moving average of USD 8.09. If we can pass through maybe Coty will be in better shape to move forward. Wait and see is the game right now! GLTA here.
Seems like sell of did not stop yet !!!!!!

Coty Sells 9% Stake in Wella to KKR in $426.5 Million Deal
"Well, thanks to the huge share offering from KKR, here we are today…. Below $8 and heading to $6s if market continues to tank. All the momentum towards $10 was flushed away and unlikely we will see any reversal upwards so soon. The big $$$ players who are keeping this stock from hitting double digits must really be celebrating now.Has anyone ask Sue and the management what is their target share price and what they expect year to year? Or what is COTY worth in terms of share price?By the way…… seems like death cross is coming up soon if this keeps up and you guys should know what might likely happen next. :("
"Here we go, price going up because of company going in right direction. Giving to much information on details just causes to much expectation, small amounts of good news reduces expectations so the stock price goes up because everything is lining up for a bright future, the end of Covid with people getting vaccinated, women and men freshing up their look for travel, clubbing, going back to work, their social media page, dining out, back to school, back to the gym, Halloween parties, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, birthdays, Valentines on and on and on"
Strange whats reason for this drop again

"Coty schedules an investor meeting on September 13th as the company intends to reaffirm its guidance, trends and strategic information that was discussed in the Company earnings press release."
Coty is rebuilding it self and that in turn will increase our share price into the future. Coty is a strong hold. Do not allow the vulgarities of the Market to affect your investment in Coty.
swing trading Coty was my best decision in my IRA.
Delta airlines post better then expected EPS beat as well revenue beat great for Coty meaning sales in the airports getting better with more people traveling
sold half my shares today and bought Skin....
"If you have the cash, buy this dip. Another over reaction. Debt ceiling won’t be an issue despite what the media will say."
Ulta guidance is dragging the category lower. COTY longs know that DTC model has been in the works and paying off. Also partnerships with Amazon and other retailers. Good time to look at the pe values of others- COTY is sorely undervalued.
Bounce is coming. It’s just right here
https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/lauren-liebermanGuys we have upgrade from Barclays
it is just worth shorting this

"It has become rather apparent that COTY shares continue to be sold by those who have received them recently by way of the WELLA agreement or whatever........For example, just this morning when the market opened over 110,000 shares were sold which shows that whomever sold them hadn't paid for them and/or have NO experience in trading stock.......That is because No-One would Sell 110K shares at the open with the futures ""up"" hundreds of points as they were today.!!!!!!!! There is buying going on, but the buying for now is being offset by that selling by those who know nothing other than they just want their money, particularly when you consider the share price was less than $3 in the last 52 weeks..... This selling will hopefully dry up by the end of Oct, and that's just a guess, including end of year tax-loss selling.........."
I sometimes wonder how much of an affect Options have on Coty's share price. It seem to be that they hold Coty back.
it would be great if we can maintain above $8 for this correction but i Doubt it.
"Remember, DB raised the KKR sale as a forward, potential negative. No more with its upgrade today lol. Buy the lights out under $10. COTY is the perfect reopening trade."
I have feeling that Q 3 has been pretty good. USA is mainly open and many other countries also with lots of events and etc. It will reflect to Coty’s revenue in positive way.

Coty may be getting ready to move forward. GLTA here...
We have 5 weeks before the next ER. Catalysts to cause a run up into earnings are 1. Closing of the Wella deal with KKR 2. Brazil IPO 3. COTY Annual meeting updates. 4. Industry insights from competitors.
Hmm lets stay on the topic. Why would kkr do this now. Well perhaps and lets assume they know a bit more than we do. There insiders after all. My take is there tired of the share price being manipulated as we all are and there fine with the 8.53. They still have a large position and there confident that the company brands are firing on all cylinders. They cut cost and are moving to on-line marketing strategies. This is panning out as sue pointed out in the conference call. So it's a SP price stabilizing move to do this now. That s my take anybody got a clue. Im long both shares and calls.
"How any of you think Sue deserves another option bonus for showing her loyalty to JAB by keeping the prices depressed? No worries that wont make her do anything favorable for the shareholders. He options will be like the others she was given, They can be cashed out in 2.5 years when JAB owns even more shares."
The calm before the take off.
Shorts will cover today. 12.50USD by EOD
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the COTY board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
"Eventually Coty will get to $12. However, you can go to almost any other stock of value and make much more before Coty will ever see that price."
the price is as it was 6 months agoEverything is green only Coty is red.what's going on with this company ?

Strap in! We in for a roller coaster ride today. Enjoy and Good Luck.
very strange day... good retailers' data and all cosmetics sectors are down.
4 billion in sales and not profitable.....
I see downside minimal risk Upside small possible gain in future. Maybe to$9 again
Resistance is about $ 8.25
The slow bleed out is painful to watch
what is driving 6% increase today?
Share price has been sideways for too long meanwhile Sue and Management has been killing it all year. Highly undervalued
Final hour of the day was nice- strong close! 
dead stock.. EL up 3% with huge DOW market gain
"Who knows what is really happening: This could be just an artificial dump! Or maybe with new, younger management KKR might buy more shares. Or maybe just more manipulation by the big boys. What ever it is. I am going to keep holding the proverbial bag because a friend once told me that I can't lose if I don't sell. Or what ever! LOL"
Will wait pump to 8 and will sell all my shares tired of waiting and loosing other opportunities!!!!!!
Let's see if we can hold this above 8.50 for more than a couple days. Through Friday would be nice...????See the tiny little things you ask for when youve been here for a year!!!!!!!9.00 should really be our true support until next ER.
maybe a prayer will help
Wow. Havent been here for a long time. Seems that stock is not moving at all. What a shame. Good company….
Is hige gamble to keep stock through Q earnings!!!!! Most probably Coty will not reach revenue or EPS so too risky to hold more
"$7.64 - $7.75 is big support level. It means, we will fly to the moon soon."
All the bashibg on this board is one guy with multiple accounts. Mute and buy mute and buy
Ouchhhh what is reason of this drop ??????
look at Revlon and Coty 5 year charts... similarities????
It is unbelievable how this stock let us down day after day...
Market is in green zone no reason coty to be in red zone very strange price action
If COVID had indeed anything to do with the make up sale then this quarter Sue et al have no excuse. Using Delta variant as an excuse is lame and wont work as it did not cause any new close downs. The earnings therefore should be at worst the same as the last quarter. Anything better and the tock will be $9-10 in a couple of days.
The street gives KKR way to much clout. They're just another fast money investor. Nothing has changed otherwise. the reopening is alive and well. Buy.
Not Surprised.
if they don't blow out earnings 6s make be in the cards on year end window dressing. I'm accumulating. 2022 should be a much better year for Coty.
Well just got my COTY proxy. Is Sue worth $3.52m a year?
PAAATHETIC. Let's just agree on that. Still will not sell below $12. Guess that means i will still be here for another few quarters? Hopefully they can move some major retail volume during holidays.
institution ownership down from 50%to 35%.. comments???
Sham-Wow! over 12 million shares traded today. And looking better! A couple more days like this and I will be very satisfied. GLTA here....
"They are going to try getting it to the $6s. Never say never. You will never know in this dirty game of share price manipulation and #$%$ dirty money dealings. I shudder to think if the few coming quarter earnings reports disappoints instead and fails to meet expectations somehow. It went to $7.50 pretty fast. And Sue and the company board of directors all keeping very quiet.And even if the earning reports are reasonably good, look how far the share price has already fallen?.. at the most it will only try to scratch the recent huge share price offering at $8.50. After that don?t be surprised to see it crumbling again. So basically we are all stuck at some losing no mans land?? the opportunity costs are huge given that there are other better performing company shares out there with better potential, even within the same beauty industry and sector. More so in some others."
"i think, we will reverse today."
"Coty has a lot of brand name products, some of which are not popular or profitable. Mgt should consider giving up a few of these brands to improve profitability. Getting some additional cash from the Wella deal may be a starting point."
we need to close over 7.86 today if not 8.
Seems Coty will prepare to investors amazing News on investor day on 18 of November!!!!!! Even location is different this time hopefully smth positive will happen!!!! I strongly believe Coty worth more then 10$
Where is all bashers ????????
good day to add shares.... not bullish yet but soon

'tomorrow' AHHHAHAHH
Would not be surprised if they announced a reverse split.
"This is very discouraging. When a stock that is down significantly over the last 2 months can't go up and stay up on very good news......well, that is a problem, a major problem......this stock could end up down for the day."
"Pathetic daily SP movement action. Like sitting on the bleachers waiting for a game to start and the players come to the field with a bad case of diarrhea and the game gets canceled. Holding this long for almost a year now. Thankfully, I'm holding at a low avg of 3.99. But then again tempted to sell as money making opportunities are being passed on due to this holding. Waiting for the upcoming ER to see if it'll move the needle enough back to mid 10's at least. A place where I didn't even think of selling when it hit a few weeks ago because I believed in the company and their future guidance. But this price manipulation is getting old already. Not even dividends to wet your whistle somewhat while it recovers. At the end of the day, the stockholders should be taken care of, Sue. Remember that. Clearly, we're still here...show us what you've got."
Girls/women are looking a lot prettier these days equals buy the dip.
here comes 8.65-8.7 as highs.
"The KKR deal means it IS a dilute event but it has been known it would happen when the deal was made last year when the stock was at 4 dollars and the strike price was 6.25, if you look at the August 27th filing KKR converted all of the preferred shares for 150mm shares which means the shares outstanding will go to 920mm shares but they no longer have to pay back the debt of the preferred sand no longer have to pay the 90mm dollars a year which could go to pay off debt or maybe one day go to dividends to common shareholders. So, yes dilutive but not in the traditional sense of a secondary to raise cash for the company it is a preferred that is converted. Enterprise value basically will increase 400mm more or less from this transaction. Part of me think this is the price to pay for avoiding major issues, KKR helped the company avoid issues but did so at a steep price. Hopefully, we get that money back when wella stake gets sold for $2 to $3 billion of which I am certain half goes to pay debt and maybe some goes to buyback shares or start the dividend again, either way company is profitable now and will continue to be."
A lot of people in this forum say about Sue and JAB. There must be something else with this stock though.
Thanks DB for upgrade!!!!!!!!! Sentiment is getting better

"I was just at my local CVS. The new merchandising looks terrific! They have also grown to 20 linear feet for Cover Girl and 8 linear feet for Sally Hanson. If you know anything about retail merchandising, it’s all about dollars per square foot.

"It looks like a bargain basement sale maybe getting into high gear thanks to Sue, JAB and KKR. If they want to keep on depressing Coty's share price I am going to load my truck up with more cheap shares of Coty and will cash in later. Make my day Coty! Because when the going gets tough, the tough get going!"
It just can’t keep it up
I beginning to think that Coty is holding up better than I expected. Anybody else think the same?
So where is Brendon/Brent? he is usually panty sniffing Sue and has been absent since the dip.
60% of this stock is owned by insiders... it really makes no senses for insider to tank this stock at this price level... it has show no signs of over $8... it didn't make senses at all!
Coty is up 6.12% to 8.49
"it is great day for me... coty up 7%, crbu up 7% plus Peri up 30%.. all set"
I believe this tree has been shaken just about as hard as it could be. We are either going back up sometime in the future or we will be stuck in limbo holding the bag. That is my reality check....
"Patience pays off,Long and strong  "
"Well, I have had a little time to reconsider what is going on with Coty today and I believe that we are at the bottom again with Coty's stock price. If Coty can meet or exceed their projections on November 4th than we will probably move up smartly. If not! We will languish at this level until the economy smooths out. Although I have by doubts about that with the buffoons we have in our Government today. Coty is still a value play and a turn around situation that we have to wait for. Because those were the reasons why I invested in Coty."
Selling is over guys. Should be weekly green average till $10

"I am longer term share holder holding 6000 shares for 14 months now. Although I am up since my original purchase, I am starting to wonder if there are deeper concerns with this company that only the big boys are privy too. I understand the manipulation but why manipulate a company for this long. Wondering if I should just cut ties and move on. I have current sells in at $12 and $16, 2000 shares for each one while letting the remaining 2000 shares to ride . I just don’t know if this company is healthy enough to get there. My only hope now is a strong Christmas season. Good luck to longs including me."
I have a sneaky suspicion that Coty may move up from here. How far is anybody's guess.

Time to buy

The forces behind Coty will not be able to manipulate much longer.
this price and lack of momentum is sic
"This one needs to go up quick... there are lots of good investment opportunities.. I bought UPST and it went up 5 times within two month.... my point is that investor patience is limited and we would need to have some return within 3 month, 6 months and 1 year... check last year Nov, this year Feb price.. very disappointed so far... today, Dow jumps 500 points and it didn't move to $8"

Wella has been a great cow to milk. Terrific deal and financial prudence on the part of COTY! 
Believe me or not this Q will be very much positive and Coty will head above 10$ !!!!!!Mark my words
