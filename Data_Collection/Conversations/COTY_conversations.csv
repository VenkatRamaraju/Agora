"Believe it or not I like the Bashers and Pumpers here because they provide entertainment for me when I am bored. The stock market is not about always going up or down. To me it is like an ocean that ebbs and tides continuously. The fact that we were up six cents today kinda proves that to me. So keep bashing and pumping while smart investors are accumulating and holding. It is all good. Oh! And as far as manipulation goes, I do think Coty is manipulated somewhat by the big boys. Hope I am on the right side."
I believe Coty has 59% of the Perfume Market. Although I am not sure of what I am saying here. They either have 59% of their product in Perfume or they have 59% of the Perfume Market. Please let me know which is correct. I am getting burned out on information.

"No, no, vaccinations will ensure that the reopening continues. Buy."
"Honestly, I thought we'd be around 12 at least after a great ER. However, I know it will be soon enough and seeing a 14-15 SP EOY at the very least. Continuing to hold long without any hesitation until end of May 2022 at the very least and maybe longer after reassessing then. A no-brainer here with the great growth guidance & projected revenue that were released. GL longs."

This is a non dilutive offering. No new shares are being issued. Stop freaking out
KKR is a VC. They're not investors per se. Use their rash exit to buy cheap. I did.
I see $12+ today
Haven’t you ambulance chasing shorts learned your lesson yet  ???
44m shares traded in a very narrow price range today. Very stable floor IMO. Bullish 
"Beauty products companies often command premium valuations. LOreal (LRLCF) and Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL) trades for more than 55 times earnings, while e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) sells for 90 times earnings. ELF price to sales 8.1 LRCLF price to sales 7.4 COTY price to sales 1.6"
I smell a partnership in this level
jeez 10+ close would be great recovery.10.5+ close would be obvious breakout and its been too long and we need it now..
They had some interesting insights about COTY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"this upcoming earning is very critical for Coty. At the least, it was for me to decide whether it is worth long time holding and whether the management is on the right path"
"Jefferies Stick to Their Buy Rating for Coty Inc6 hours ago (Aug 25, 2021 05:09AM ET) Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephanie Wissink maintained a Buy rating on Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc on Tuesday, setting a price target of $12, which is approximately 46.88% above the present share price of $8.17.Wissink expects Coty Inc to post earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.02 for the third quarter of 2021.The current consensus among 3 TipRanks analysts is for a Moderate Buy rating of shares in Coty, with an average price target of $13.5.The analysts price targets range from a high of $15 to a low of $12."
Great opportunity to add more shares !!!!!
"Congrats to the management for being so loyal to their puppeteers, JAB!"
close 9.9x - 10.0xUpgrades to 12-14 range is coming.still target is 12.5-13 by EOY
I am looking forward to September because the Stock Market should react very well during the month of September. Coty will probably move up smartly and we will enjoy watching our nest eggs grow. Good luck to everybody and God Bless America.

"just to show you how low the confidence level is in COTY, the 2020 jan $5 strike price is 3.34 while the share price is 8.53. So the call option not only has no time value but it sells at a discount to the price. If I had the money I could make money buying the underlying shares and selling them back. Go ahead and tell me how wonderful sue is."

"Additional insights from IPAR call today. Regarding inflation and offsetting rising cost, especially freight:“…we have decided to increase prices. We gave notice to most of our customers on August 1, so this was not a long time ago, that we will have certain price increase on January 1. The reception was quite accepted because we don't do this often and it seems that all our competitors have -- are doing it. So, we didn't see any issues with that. Price increase that we are talking about is anywhere from 2% to 4%”."
If EPS is -9cents means coty 9USD share should be worth -9USD. 1 share generate -9cents. This is no brainer. Proper scam

"Okay, sp will drop to about 8.53 dollars because it is the offering price. There is nothing new that these offerings are below the market value to get them sold. I think this might really help Cotys sp in long run, because there is more shares to be traded. Lets see if it sp drops a lot more which I do not believe because fundamentals have not changed since er. Revenue is growing, costs are going down and demand is growing."
$9.48 at 12:30pm EST. (we just went positive .37%). Sit back and let the market do its thing today.Its Friday... relaaaxxxx
Have to say that this stock has become a good fodder for trading between $8-$9. Some folks have been making really good $$$ just doing that over the weeks/months. But measure it against the rest in the same industry…. It stinks since the others have already run up so far hitting new highs while this one basically tanked (from $10s) and stagnated.

now in september there should investment conference or something right ?
"EL 1-Q of 2022 Outlook First Quarter Fiscal 2022Sales OutlookReported net sales are forecasted to increase between 17% and 19% versus the prior-year period.Organic net sales, which excludes the non-comparable impacts from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures as well as the impact from currency, are forecasted to increase between 11% and 13%."
Hmm lets stay on the topic. Why would kkr do this now. Well perhaps and lets assume they know a bit more than we do. There insiders after all. My take is there tired of the share price being manipulated as we all are and there fine with the 8.53. They still have a large position and there confident that the company brands are firing on all cylinders. They cut cost and are moving to on-line marketing strategies. This is panning out as sue pointed out in the conference call. So it's a SP price stabilizing move to do this now. That s my take anybody got a clue. Im long both shares and calls.
What does earnings matter now? Even if it beats it will just get back to where it was a week ago
It might turn green You never know lol
"Revlon just reported earnings. This quote is great insight into COTY expectations for mass cosmetics sales. Mass cosmetics make up 24% of the portfolio.

good stock chinas slowing be careful!
So many comments with no sense of understanding !!!! Relax and wait the Q earnings it will be blowing Coty will pop above 10 very soon !!!! Holding 10k shares with average 5.7
The Stock Market is forward looking and so am I. I am looking forward to the next two or three quarters for turn around and improving their bottom line. Coty will be a winner and the future belongs to the people who are willing to risk what they believe in Coty. Do your own Do Diligence and reap what you sow.
"Highly undervalued. Sue nabi and team have done a wonderful job since she joined on as CEO a little over a year ago. Look at what she did with Loreal, very impressive"
"Coty schedules an investor meeting on September 13th as the company intends to reaffirm its guidance, trends and strategic information that was discussed in the Company earnings press release."
Thesis validated COTY is a Long with a new phenomenal management and a definite turnaround play wait for the analysts upgrades
"Coty is going to expand its skin care portfolio with luxury brands and with mass.products. Adidas brand will be next in mass. with skin care portfolio. Coty is looking for Global Brand Director adidas (Skin Care). It means Coty wants to play with Nivea, P&G and L'oreal in mass market.

"all - it is all coming down to whether Sue and Coty are able to meet the earning or not.. If they are able to meet the earning and confirm the revenue guidance next week, it would show they are on the right directions for the future growth. If that is case, it is worth riding the stock for long run. If they miss the earning again, I would feel something won't work after sue took the company for more than 9 months."
"They will beat earnings for sure. Simply look at the commentary from Macy’s, EL and LOreal. Fragrance is on fire. Coty with brands such as Gucci, Burberry and Tiffany is the number 1 fragrance company in the world! and they have the Kardashians!"
"For it to be convincing that it is really on the move upwards, Coty needs to go up above $10 and hold ground…. Otherwise it is still at the range where it was for months between $8 to $9+ and we know some big $$$ players have been manipulating and suppressing it. It could very well repeat again. Am sure a lot of us prefer that it doesn’t get trapped in that pathetic wash and rinse cycle.Whether KKR and JAB are up to some tricks to take it private remains debatable and questionable. It is ‘undervalued’ and we all know it can do better. Like many here, I always thought it should already have been $12 to $15 by now given how upbeat the market has been performing on the whole (over the year) and how the other competitors within the same beauty industry/sector have been shooting up in their share prices. This stock really needs to catch up more for sure."

Holy favk enough with the discord
"What a wonderful leadership. For those who want to point that Dow and S&P are down, its because of the low CPI number which is a supposed to be a good thing for Coty as their supply chain should be cheape4r and people should have more money to spend on consumables. and oh btw Dow is down .91% and S&P is down .63% while coty is down 3.5%. That's 500% more downward pressure than S&P."

"Who’s ready for the $7s? Then next earnings, IF and only IF they can deliver good results, it probably goes back to high $8s and $9s again as per before. Same as where we all were before sometime this year and then something will happen again, and it goes back down. You can practically see what has been happening….Worst case if the shares are gonna pick up pace upwards, KKR (or JAB) still have a boat load to do another share offering….. ouch!"
"business good, but stock price is slow.. they need to get more large institutions buying in.... I am holding for long with 4% in my portfolios.. it is shame that I bought CRBU at $15 two months ago and it gave me more than 60% return while Coty is still dancing around in mid 9s... so I would believe it has good value to balance the portfolio for long run...but not for quick money maker in 6 to 9 months.."

"ohhh,watch the baby traders take their usual 10cents,they should trade huggies !!"
Looks like it is back to the $8-$9s range again. Not sure if it is something to be jumping around in ecstasy at the moment. I will be more convinced and happy if it can go pass $10 and hold ground above it. Otherwise it is back in the court again for more manipulative play by some big $$$ entities. Don’t forget we were stuck in that range for a number of months previously……… I won’t deny though that I am actually a little relieved that the stock didn’t tank. :)
"In at $8.42, out at $9.76, not bad for 10 minutes."
The preferred don't usually effect the price action of the commons unless they dilute the holding of common as they are about to. Now had they made the conversion pending price of $15 this would be a win win for all parties but then they would have to wait for that price to get there. It would have created a possible confidence in the share prices and they would have eventually been able to cash out. This rush seems to to indicate an urgency. Why else would u convert ur preferred to below current common prices?

"Awful undervalued. COTY is even doing better than pre Covid, strong forecast, should be $12 by now."

first gap fill 8.45 and being optimistic close around 9-9.059.5 would be too high for COTY ..long holders know it like me ... It's slow money...
lets see if we get to 10 today to see higher highs and close 9.8x if not higher. IMOWe could be stuck here again for a while like nearly 6 months of consolidation isn't enough which is between 9-10 (+/- 50 cents)
This price action start to become very scary !!!! Waiting Q earnings to decide what to do with Coty!!!!! Feeling like it wll tank after earnings
Gee! Insiders are rewarded and so are we as investors. I know I am! Coty is going to grow in many ways.
"Kylie birthday collection launches at noon today, across the globe via dtc. Watch how this sells out!!! Marketing genius!"
It can pop anytime soon
should be $14 at least
"As I stated many times, coty will rise only on good reports. ONLY. now maybe IPO news. Each time good reports come out, more investors regain trust, or become interested to invest. I am here since april 2020. What I noticed, that after each good report, we get +2$-3$ per share. I see 10$ no problem. After next ER 12$ is possible. Then after one more maybe 15$ and then stabilise at 13-14$. That is 6 months from now. By 2022 we may have 12$, by summer 2022 we may have 15. Provided that no market correction and good reports. Agree?"
Beautiful!
our fate for a period of 3 months will be decided today

Going up people
"COTY is highly correlated to more people getting out and about, ie., the reopening. Much of that is in front of us. No complaints about mgmt. Buy."
Great company but being held back. Sales and performance are there. What do you guys think?
This is super kool. Kylie Cosmetics has been relaunched and will be very successful. Coty is reimagining it self for better days going forward. GLTA here!
Seeking Alpha articles are variable in quality depending on whose writing them however the below article after thorough reading and doing my own DD seems pretty accurate take a peek and see what you think https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410174-bottom-fishing-club-coty Another link to show you the true short on the float is circa 14% The short on the float is there for historical reasons IMHO https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/research/stocks/summary?symbol=COTY Short squeeze potential could be quite high. Do your own DD
coty to 8
Am sure the bulls and bears will agree that this company is not shareholder friendly at all. Definitely prone to manipulation.SEC doesn’t care anyway.We all should obviously know by now when it comes to share price why it is such a ‘laggard’ compared to all its other competitors in the same beauty industry/sector. Utterly disappointing and disturbing. What will it take for this company’s shares to really progress from here I wonder? When the coming bear market is right at the corner………?
Seriously might sell before earnings. EL is in the green and we go down again. Tired of losing hope
Well I just bought the October 15 $9 calls. Hopefully we can at least get back to that.
Full reopening trade is now before us. The delta variant is losing strength. Sort of like IDA after landfall. Buy hard below $9.
"And then come the upgrades.......follow up should be good as they play catch up with the others. They have laid out a clear pathway and they are executing. Will not run away yet, but this should establish a floor/base to move forward from."
Next leg up should put us around 12-13$. COTY has been severely undervalued for too long
"you can buy all the shares you want,this is guaranteed to DROP UÑTIL EARNINGS, then back up,so sell now buy back 1 day before earnings"
If you want to prevent the shorts from shorting just put in a sell order for the future and that will lock up your shares and they will not be able to short the amount of shares that you have.
Macys at 20$ and were a far better company with premium products and a rockstar CEO. I think we should be around 25$ a share by now but regardless of share price things are looking very good for COTY
Someone is loading up on shares. 2 one million block buys today.
Jobless claim is low and this one will be up significantly.. no reason to hold it back
"Green day and this is up less than 1%. If the market was flat today, this is down 4%. Something to ponder. Too risky holding through ewrnings. $6 after earnings."
Earning big beat! and strong start to fiscal and Brazil IPO. This will fly !
"If the price set was $8..53 to the public, we never touched $8.50. How does that work? Surely most of this was KKR"
"Coty pursues partial IPO of its Brazil business while retaining a controlling stake, which will help advance the company’s deleveraging agenda."
This stock is volatile because of the small float the good news it can go up as quick as it goes down
Slightly above resistance with low volume. This will be soon 10.50$ and beyond.
Where is Mixter ?????? The best basher of Coty ….

below 9s...... you heard it here
El had huge beat. Why isn’t COTY going up in sympathy?
COTY still has too much debt. They need to sell some brands to at least cut it in half
I sometimes wonder how much of an affect Options have on Coty's share price. It seem to be that they hold Coty back.
Thx for the cheap shares lol. My family salutes you.
I think we hit $11 before earnings and top $12.50 shortly after. Almost all competitors have reported and results have been spectacular for all categories. COTYs portfolio of brands is one of the best. This along with prudent execution of strategy and plan this past year will deliver an impressive sales and profitability story on the 26th to close out their fiscal year. GL longs
Earnings were great and future is bright! I feel this is a great buy on the pullback today.
"COTY is an investment for the next 3-5 years. Spend one hour of your time and watch COTY presentations from the last 5 years. Only this year COTY has focused on consumer, innovations and investments to fast growing categories as SKIN care with higher margin . COTY copies EL models of portfolio brands. I would like to remind you that P&G bought WELLA 16 years ago for 7 billion dollars and after 10 years sold Wella to COTY. Even P&G could not manage WELLA business well vs L'oreal. Two previous CEOs except Peter Harf did not have any experience in the perfumery business at all. Camillo Panne big part of his life working at Reckitt where JAB was the biggest shareholder. Pierre Laubies spent 25 years in Mars for the pet-food business after that he was CEO for Jacobs coffee business as a private company in JAB holding. Perfumery is a very emotional business and to be smart with P&L only it is not enough to succeed as El and L'oreal. My opinion, the big mistake which JAB did was not being a proper CEO for such a business as perfumery. Current CEO is great. She has good experience and expertise in such very competitive category as perfumery. She knows how to manage and develop COTY but it is not enough for stock growth. COTY has lost credibility for investors- from 30 USD to 2,85 USD price share during 4 years with such ICONIC brands that's horrible. COTY needs 4 or 6 successful quarterly results and come back with dividends and after that these shares will fly over the roof:). I think that JAB will not buy back COTY- 5 billions debts, plus money for stock buyback- 4 billions and current debt which JAB has about 10 billions. Based on JAB's annual reportJAB had 3 billion losses in 2020 . JAB needs money for debt covering. It could be dividends and share sales with higher prices than in an IPO."
"JAB will do third IPO during one year.NEW YORK (Reuters) - JAB Holding Co is carving Panera Bread out into a new unit that will also include Caribou Coffee, Einstein Bros Bagels and other brands to help the chains expand as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, Panera Chief Executive Officer Niren Chaudhary told Reuters.The new group, to be called Panera Brands, combined will have nearly 4,000 locations in 10 countries.The new structure, which Panera will announce later on Thursday, is the kind of maneuver companies sometimes make ahead of a deal like an initial public offering or sale.Chaudhary, who will lead the new group while retaining his position at Panera Bread, declined to comment on an IPO or sale but said that ""we are always exploring opportunities.""JAB is a $120 billion, family-owned Luxembourg-based consumer private equity firm that also owns major stakes in Keurig Dr. Pepper and beauty company Coty Inc.In June, it spun off its Krispy Kreme Inc doughnut business, which went public at a $2.7 billion valuation.In May 2020 its JDE Peet's coffee chain went public at 2.25 billion euros.All the Panera Brand companies ""have really strengthened their respective brands, teams and business models through the pandemic,"" Chaudhary said in an interview. ""We can collectively leverage the runway of growth.""Each company will remain independent and retain its own chief executive officer, app and loyalty program. But they plan to collaborate on menu and beverage development, data analytics, suppliers and other areas, Chaudhary said.""We can help propel the brands faster because of this infrastructure we have,"" he said.The group plans to open new cafes and so-called ghost kitchens for delivery only, to open locations in new countries and to explore consumer packaged goods."
If the volume comes in at over 11 million shares trading today than we may see 12 USD......
Youd have to have an IQ under 20 to be bearish here. Highly Undervalued growth company with a very professional CEO
Beautiful start to proceedings today. Bought a few more shares last week so very happy that paid off. Not selling anything pre $12 then may take 10% off the table to lock in some profit in what would be an extremely bloated position. Long term target 15+

If people can not see Coty is worth over twelve Dollars a share now they should just go ahead and unload because I will be glad to pick up some of the slack. Coty is going in the right direction. If that is not good enough for you than unload. That is my best advice and opinion. Good luck.....
"someone I remember compared EL with coty. Well, in 1 year timeframe we made 177%, meanwhile EL 50% . Difference is that EL is well established company, which was not on the verge of bankruptcy.

Up
"+100% in 1 year. slightly fell last report even though it was not perfect QR and stayed in 8-9 range. now went to 7$ range for a few weeks and all you started crying:D ridiculous... what you want? +10% growth every day?... you guys funny... If QR bad, we go to 6-7$ range maybe dip to 5$ and stay there until next QR. If it is good, we go to 9+. Very simple logic... This company was dying since 2016-2017, and now it is slowly resurrecting. You cannot expect AMC-like jumps. That is simply not the case. I believe in good QR. Will hold until I am sure this company found it's way to prosperity. Sell at 20+ My average 6$ . Have been accumulating since 3$."

Lets see what Q earnings will be !!!! Should be good this time
COTY will soar with the successful launch of Kylie's product in EU. Another tailwinds are: i) Experienced CEO; ii) Potential to be acquired very very soon as KKR is already inside the Coty's door.
Beautiful earnings report as expected
COTY’s short interest is 15% while GME and AMC are 13% and 18% respectively. COTY has been a battered stock for years. Calling all Reddits and Wallstreet Bets to make COTY a meme stock.
If you like roller coaster rides we are on one. I see no reason one way or the other to panic. Enjoy if you stay good luck if you go.
S&P Global RatingsCoty Inc. Ratings Affirmed On Modest DebtReduction; Outlook Remains Negativehttps://www.jabholco.com/section/press-releasesNot so good news):
"I got feeling we may jump over ten USD today, It is only .23 cents plus 1 or more."
This is so wrong. at least the JAB offering was at $11.65
Today we are going to take a bath in more ways than I can think of. I am holding for the long haul. You can't lose if you do not sell. That is your options for now.
"IMO, this is a great opportunity to load up more or avg down for the ones who feel like they missed out at some point. Hold if you can't buy & stay the course. All should fare well if you are LONG. Why would you panic sell now when you could've sold a few weeks ago when it hit the 10's. It'll come around & up again sooner than you think. Matter of fact it already did inch up. GLTA, GLTA"
"Brenden, your proposal of ""15-20$ by end of year easily"" is beyond dreaming.Do you understand basic math? the market cap is $7.292 billion. the proposed $15-20 is huge spread of $3.8 billion. @ $15, market cap = $11.5 billion@ $20, market cap = $15.3 billionThat's a difference of $3.8 billion (that's half the current market cap)Do you realize that even a growth stock is not likely to 100% in less than 4 months?I like to support mixster's suggestion that if you end up being wrong that you go away permanently from this board and if he is wrong that he/she should go away permanently. The race is on."
"lol a company that likes to torpedo its own stock momentum is one to stay far away from. Last week considered a buy in the 9s, now I wouldn't touch til it hits 6s"
The simple fact is that Coty is paying down her debt and pairing down brands that are not working as hard as they expect. Coty is situating her self to rise above all the miss-characterizations by the doubting Thomas's.
Coty is not trading lower because its disrespected or that its misunderstood. Its by design. It seems more and more clear that JAB owns Sue and she is playing to their long term plan to take the company either fully private or to continue to accumulate more and more shares until there is little left of retail and investment by others and then the price will reflect the true value. They are playing it smart by keeping the prices depressed to keep others away while they continue to accumulate more shares. There was already one lawsuit regarding this issue. there will eventually be more. They will pay it off with shareholders money and when JAB has enough accumulated thenBAM! the price will go up either as a private holding or as a company that JAB can then unload over priced shares.
stock needs serious help to break through 10.5 and get to 12-13 range..soo undervalued..market is all time high and still not getting enough bid(s)patience..
"A lot of talk about Coty beating earnings or not, so my question: What is your expectation on earnings?"
"How many of the folks making comments have worked in the beauty field before or are still in it? If so, how many of those have the pedigree of Sue Nabi? If you do, then quit your current job and get hired by Sue. She could use more great minds. Why is it that Sue left Loreal and took on the land of misfit fragrances at Coty? And, why is it that Sue has made a noticeable difference in only one year? Sue is that good. KKR is monetizing part of its Coty position. That is a good thing. It allows more investors into the mix and makes KKR less onerous to Coty. In the meantime, Sue just keeps coming....like the terminator. She will reinvigorate the name brands. She will create a new persona with the likes of Kylie K and others. Sit back and be patient. This is going to take some time.....but like anything worth doing....it's worth doing well."
I am starting to believe more in Mixter's conspiracy theories.
"Very strong forecast, next Er will be huge!"
I have given up all hope. Will Sell before earnings. Can’t risk riding this down to 5
What is KKR really up to and what do you think the desired outcome is for them? Sincere and educated responses only.
In my opinion if you invested in under eight you should be great. If you invested over eight you are going to have to wait. Either way is Ok!
9.55-9.6 needs to hold by close for any chance to visiting 10.5 soon..or we back in grind of 9-10 range. IMO
Strong support at 8.30
I don't like bashers but I also don't like empty pumpers either.I remember when someone on this board said coty will b in the 7's and Brenden come down so hard on him/her and said he has a low iq. Now I wonder how he feels? can he at least say he was wrong?
The price @ 4pm close will tell the tale. Sue hasn't crashed it yet thats a good sign
very strange day... good retailers' data and all cosmetics sectors are down.
"after one week of up beating earnings, this one didn't do anything and I sold half of my positions before its secondary offer... so glad I did that... something very strange with this company...I will hold another half till end of this year to see what happens"
Wont go under offering price..
Final hour of the day was nice- strong close! 
Not an event to sell over. Diluted share reporting doesn't increase. Buy the dip like I did.
The problem I have with this arrangement with KKR is the price per share. Why so low? Should have been at least nine dollars.
Coty Prices Secondary Offering of 50 Mln Shares at $8.53 Each. Source: https://prem.li/DailyStockMarketNews
Wow! Volume today is six times what it normally is. That to me looks like Coty has a future. And at the end of day fourteen percent up is a good direction to go for Coty to rebuild its brand.
here comes 9.9x if not 10.x
Here come JAB's friends:CFRA MAINTAINS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF COTY INC.Coty Is Maintained at Underweight by Wells Fargo

"If this is going to be flush than I hope it is a fast one because what ever happens, normal investors are being hurt and scared off. But we do have chance of popping or surprising in the next couple of weeks. I am hanging on because I have left myself a lot room to play with but I don't like it."
"KKR charges a lot for a ride in their lifeboat. Coty survived, but will walk with a limp for awhile."
8/30/21D. A. Davidson Raises Price Coty Inc. (COTY) $10.00 -> $10.50
I will take small increments up until the quarterly report and than I expect a nice bounce. The big boys are watching and waiting to pounce on Coty. Wait and see if I am correct.
Super light volume. Buy and hold. Carry on. 
The Market Maker has their book and they know at what point investors are willing to let go. And that is where they go to shake the tree out of weak hands and then run the stock back up. This is not rocket science because they are messing with us along with the big boys. If you believe in what you invested in then hold for long run.
Is the $8 support about to fall?
"I just today took the time to listen to the entire earnings cc. I was very encouraged to hear how well each area of the business is performing. I think the 2022 forecast is a major low ball given the momentum that was reported across all segments of their business. The six target business plan is being followed exactly as laid out last year. I sense that the management team is turning the corner on credibility, which is very important before big money will be all in. This is starting to look like a real deal turnaround......2 more quarters of execution against the business plan and you are looking at major stock price increase. Thats my takeaway and my money is on the line."
Does COTY sell Lube in their makeup lines?

After the sale KKR remains COTY 2nd largest share holder with 10.9%.
Ulta had huge earnings beat. COTY shouldn’t be able to F this up
Non gap beat earnings by 2 cents. That’s the number that matters
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
I know everyone wants us to cross the $10 barrier but we really need to hold $9 for a while. This will shale off short term traders and option holders of quick profit taking. Once they are done then we should push to $10. otherwise we will cross to 10 only to have it short lived.
Wohoooo Q earnings beated 
tomorrow we go down? Any thoughts?
"I think we can almost predict what’s gonna likely happen….. with this huge secondary offering, in the short term the stock price will be punished and hit bad. No way will it pass $10. It will drop back down to $8s again and maybe even $7s…. (Or $6s if whole market collapses). Then, IF and WHEN COTY announce good earnings results next quarter (assuming that will happen), it goes back to high $8s and $9s again. Typical wash and rinse. There you have it…. Whole year of ‘nothing’ and then the cycle restarts again.No wonder this is such a ‘laggard’ and is way behind all the other established players in the same beauty sector/industry, despite having so many brands under it. It is one of the most manipulated stock ever. Definitely not shareholder friendly.Personally I do think it is undervalued and have said before it should already have been $12-$15 by now. Looking at how it has performed so far, COTY will never be even a quarter of EL ever. Someone should challenge Sue to do that. I will gladly eat my words if COTY can even come close to a quarter of EL. Rev is doing even better than COTY. What a joke."
I am happy! I hope the rest of you will feel the same. Good luck for the rest of the day!
"This stock is perpetually pinned between $7 to $9. Looks like it will hover here at this price for a while. And then IF and IF they do deliver good results next quarter, at the most they go to $9+. So what?s new really? After that it will probably repeat again by dropping back down on whatever ?lame? #$%$ Don?t forget that KKR and JAB still have substantial amount of shares/bonds (preferential or otherwise) and can/may do another round of huge offering or selling anytime. Who?s to stop them?$10 price level has now become a massive resistance level on the charts and am sure lots of selling will happen there since they have established that barrier in place now. Until the day it can break $10 convincingly and hold ground, I think it is too early for anyone to start rejoicing on empty optimism.Disappointment with this stock is simply an understatement.Just pray hard that this market won?t crash hard in the near future. Because if it does, it is gonna be ugly for all and more so for this stock in particular."
"We have some traction... ""Coty is now expecting first-quarter sales to grow by a high teens percentage."" And +13% gain on the day will bring attention from the broader retail market. This is what we needed to put COTY on the map. Will continue to get stronger from here..."
Does anybody have any thoughts on the Brazilian IPO. How that could affect Coty's bottom line.
Buying more again this is a great price.
Uk easing its travel restrictions good for Coty
All the investors here when COTY went 1.29% up. LOL
dont tease now...get over 10 and PRINT 10.5 today - lol
Coty acting like all stocks. The tide will turn ! Great price if you have powder!
Longs know that every quarter we get a fresh new crop of ambulance chasing shorts who get their rocks off on bashing the company. The mute feature is great for filtering out all of that useless noise.GL longs! 
"There are a lot of bashers on the page, posting negativity. Ignore them. They wouldn’t be here unless they had a motive. That motive is to get you to sell your shares. Ask yourself, why would someone take the time to post daily, negative comments, pretending to own a large number of shares? Why? If you don’t believe the stock will give you a good return, you wouldn’t own it. If you do own it, you wouldn’t post the same tired comments about the CEO. Tune those people out."
"Wouldn’t it be funny if the stock got bashed and somehow sold off to Low $7s (and/or even $6+) prior to earnings and then finally on 26th Aug when and if we get good earnings reports, the stock price goes back to $8-$9+ and stays around there again? Back to square 1.Mmmmm…. I wonder. Just a thought that’s all."
Revlon went up 5 percent today. What does it mean that COTY can’t even rally 2 percent with earnings coming up?
KKR share sale won't change earnings' estimates. Buy the dipper!
ER tomorrow before open
"Starting Monday COTY should once again at regular market conditions and I wouldn't be surprised to see a gradual climb in the share price...... ""The offering is expected to close on September 10, 2021, subject to customary closing conditions."""
Earnings were great and future looks bright! I feel this is a good time to buy in.
"$6.50 in 2 months, mark this post. I warned you guys about the dilution 3-4 weeks ago. Huge debt and not profitable for 2-3 more years."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"TO ALL FELLOW COTY LONGS,It was a rough ride this past 3 months. I was tempted to sell in 8's, then tempted to sell in 7's last week. My conviction in this company prevailed and i held every single share I've accumulated over the past 18 months. I did not sell, I held tight. This ER was the big one, for many here it was make or break. We now have confirmation we are standing on solid ground with a future that is bright. GLTA and congrats."
The market is forward looking and the future is brighter than ever for COTY. Even a fifth grader can see that their performance and delivery over the past 4 quarters was outstanding despite the headwinds. What’s left are the many tailwinds that exist and will take their conservative 2022 outlook way over the expectation. I predict many analysts upgrades coming out the near future. Great ER call yesterday and excellent analyst questions. GL Longs 
"Coty current stock price is pure manipulation. Whole cosmetic market is growing rapidly see all report P&G,Unilever,Nivea, L'oreal. Today report from EL Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “We delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2021, capped by an exceptional fourth quarter and powered by our multiple engines of growth strategy as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. Notably, both sales and profitability meaningfully exceeded fiscal 2019 performance. Amid the challenges of the pandemic, we invested in near- and long-term growth opportunities and managed costs elsewhere with discipline, while making important progress on our social impact commitments and sustainability goals"
The street gives KKR way to much clout. They're just another fast money investor. Nothing has changed otherwise. the reopening is alive and well. Buy.
A little shake and bake is good. This is just a breather for Coty and she will take another run at the ten later.
I notice group full of panic people!!!!!! Relax guys all is going well ! You will be shocked on 26th with progress that Sue is doing so keep calm ! Just for info 7mil$ shares have been purchased by insiders last 6 month and guess what none of them sold any shares !!!!!!!
You can't lose if you do not sell. My position now is hold.
https://fintel.io/so/us/coty/kylin-management-llc
So 70 million shares traded last two days. Looks like a reset of share price. Up from here!!
What?? what do u mean COTY is down today. Oh is it because the rest of the market is red? oh but then again it goes down when the rest of the market is green. then at what point does it go up? oh right... it doesn't.
Coty looks strong and this move above $9.50 will hold. It pops above ten soon and never looks back. Business is picking up and management is finally had a plan.I’m long and staying put.
"Results are reasonable according to expectation, I would have expected a bigger reduction in debt, but that momentum seems to have passed, new goal is 4x edbitda, as opposed to the 3x they where referring to before, But good thing is that at least there is an expectation for FY22, with an adj ebdit of 900 million. First time since Sue to the lead, they actually make predictions about that."
This stock is going higher. Consolidation
1.6M Volume. COTY has been undervalued for far too long. Look up what Sue Nabi did for loreal years ago. Very impressive
I heard about COTY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
15-20$ by end of year easily. Management teams very strong here
10 + coming and staying

"Buckle up guys, its gonna be rough day. Really so not understand why are they selling but lets see how this turns out. Atleast its better for us that KKR is not that big owner anymore, so they dont have the power to keep share price low."
Amazing again we will stack in 8-7 range Same story begins if positive earnings we will jump to 10 
5 billion debt and net loss each quarter. When will they make money? Loss each quarter. No wonder share price does not return to precovid level. Intelligent response only allowed.
"Market green COTY red a little, market red COTY red a lot. Bottom line is this isn't going to $10 until near next earnings call. I should have sold for the brief seconds it was over $10 this week."
Drifting Back to Low $9s and high $8s. Wash and rinse cycle being renewed once again. Have to wait until the big $$$ players have had their fill. Even most of the analysts are Low balling it to keep price down. Oh well… what’s new?
Buying!!!
"After the big price rise yesterday, it’s normal to see some profit taking today. I’m satisfied that Coty is making progress in all areas with regards to its turnaround, so I’m holding for the long term. One thing I’d like to know is when/if we can expect the dividend to return."
Ipar smashed earnings. CEO said business is booming and best quarter ever. Their stock is 5 percent off all time high. No way Coty won’t report a blockbuster quarter.
Uptick is real. Up we go!
So many meaningless comments !!!!!! Fact is Coty on rise and it will go above 10 very soon!!!!!!
Welp apparently KKR thanks COTY is worth no more than $8.53 a share. COTY is pushing on a billion shares now. Annual shareholder meeting coming up in November I believe. Reverse split is going to have to be a topic of conversation soon.
Shares will be devoured in short order. Smart buy here. Take that to the bank.
Here we go. lets see how Coty and management will disappoint this time? will it be by numbers? by next q projection? by cost cutting projections? will it be by a simple yet deadly nudge from Sue to keep investors away? what will it be? I guess we shall find out soon.
"business model is good with growth... As long as it has growth and meet the earning, I am willing for long term and not worry about stock price much"
"the Manipulators of coty are picking the pockets of tiny little traders,takin it down till earnings!!"
Look at the sec filings:1. Peter Harf doesn’t make money till $9.492. Cottage holdco (JAB holding company) doesn’t make money till $11.49. My average shares are way lower than that and I have patience to wait this out. Follow the biggest share holders- they ain’t doing this for a loss.
I’m still up but will be risking margin calls if it tanks on earnings. I have to sell before
Watch this close in the green. Sell calls and buy puts for insurance if your thinking this will tank. I'm thinking gift they're telling us the 8.53 price how nice is that. Kinda like showing your hand to the other players. Check out the option action for additional insight. Interesting indeed.
"OK, am I correct that almost 3b is paid for debt, and that is the main reason for loss per share and decrease in cash ?Otherwise I like where this company is going. I like this report. I like this CEO. Goal is the same: HOLD until 20+... then we will see:)"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Shorts are covering as they should, based on the volume. Up or down after earnings, I'm in for the long haul. Good luck all; either way."
"The KKR deal means it IS a dilute event but it has been known it would happen when the deal was made last year when the stock was at 4 dollars and the strike price was 6.25, if you look at the August 27th filing KKR converted all of the preferred shares for 150mm shares which means the shares outstanding will go to 920mm shares but they no longer have to pay back the debt of the preferred sand no longer have to pay the 90mm dollars a year which could go to pay off debt or maybe one day go to dividends to common shareholders. So, yes dilutive but not in the traditional sense of a secondary to raise cash for the company it is a preferred that is converted. Enterprise value basically will increase 400mm more or less from this transaction. Part of me think this is the price to pay for avoiding major issues, KKR helped the company avoid issues but did so at a steep price. Hopefully, we get that money back when wella stake gets sold for $2 to $3 billion of which I am certain half goes to pay debt and maybe some goes to buyback shares or start the dividend again, either way company is profitable now and will continue to be."
Any body who loses confidence in their decisions should unload their coty position. The big guys are on the sideline just waiting for you. So! Go ahead and sell if it makes you feel better.
Beauty
"As i said, We need to maintain the $9's before everyone gets excited about hitting $10."
Retail stocks selling off on supply and freight issues for rest of year. Coty going back to mid 8 range
A small gain compared to what's coming.
with all the dilution in the last year at least they won't be claiming bankruptcy
"adjusted loss of 9 cents a share, missing forecasts for a loss of 5 cents a share. that's a 80% miss. geez......"
What ever happens with the Stock Market up or down Coty will survive and sooner or later Coty will thrive.
"Insider KKR Fund Holdings L.P. reports selling 50,000,088 shares of $COTY for a total cost of $419,500,738.32"
"As always, they will always find some ways to suppress the stock price of this company. $10 will now be a massive monster resistance level. Just when we all thought it was reversing to an uptrend after months and months of stagnated decline….. it is now being smacked down hard to kill off any and all momentum. Such coincidental timing indeed. Whatever it is…. The big $$$ market makers (aka manipulators) will always win.Some of you are really optimistic. I admire your resolute and positive belief but it will now take a long while for COTY to even make a run back to $10….. and to be honest, the general market seems ripe and prime for a crash anytime. That is gonna crush this stock further for sure.COTY better be beating expectations quarter after quarter henceforth or we will be seeing new lows soon instead for this year and next!"
Strong volume today. Hopefully we're going to be moving up.
Tailwinds for COTY1). Kylie’s launch in EU and next APAC2) Potential to be acquired with investment firms already inside COTY’s door such as KKR and JAB Holding (am into financial/acquisition firm and this is the first step in molding to sell the company)3) New CEO who has been in the Beauty industry unlike previous CEOs.4) Not fully recovered from Covid effects considering boom in the Beauty industry.
see ya in the 8s... I'll add shares...
8:25 am 2.5 mil down 47.5 mil to go. Gonna be a long 3 days.
Love hedge fund
"right now, be honest, Sue has not earned my trust till she is able to meet the earing this quarter..."
Added 1.9k @ 7.86 This is a no brainer.
"For all those who r high on yesterday's positive move, i want to remind you that we were at$10.40 with a bad q report. but due to Sue's agenda, we couldn't hold that level. It still comes down to her and her goonies as to where the price action will follow. Since yesterday, Already we have 2 well paid analysis's with old rating on coty with not very nice to things to say."
guys at one point I had 60000 shares. started swing trading since it was Under 3. just look at the charts for the last year..... over and over 6 times total. I'm extremely happy with my trades. buy and hold is great too but Coty lacks diverse ownership. check it out yourself.... the patterns are money makers.... go Sue go
Sue said they are on track to have profit growth this year.
We only missed earnings by 1 PENNY last qtr and stock down 25 percent since while market at new highs. Why feel confident Thurs?
"Considering they have been cash flow positive in this slow quarter, having a decent product margin, the increased volume due to the stronger upcoming season and market share gains should create another upwave when next quarter results will be out. Also not to forget the Kylie Cosmetics addition."
Stick to the fundamentals ELF price to sales 8.1EL price to sales 8.05LRCLF price to sales 7.4COTY price to sales 1.6 Stick with low price to sales in this over valued environment
did you see the volume today? 762% of the daily average. per marketwatch. 49 million shares vs. 6.4 million.
Wash and Rinse all over again. Yet again. And again.
Not selling! Watch this double up in November
I am sure we are going to survive this week. But I am worried about next week. Coty has to show improvement or else! Generally I think the big boys are screwing with us. I wonder how far they are willing to go?
