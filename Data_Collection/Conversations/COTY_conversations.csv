"Seems like the company is beefing up the balance sheet with paying down debt by raising capital. That goes to the bottom line. Makes the company more attractive and if 6 point plan works, things looking very up."

"Here we go, price going up because of company going in right direction. Giving to much information on details just causes to much expectation, small amounts of good news reduces expectations so the stock price goes up because everything is lining up for a bright future, the end of Covid with people getting vaccinated, women and men freshing up their look for travel, clubbing, going back to work, their social media page, dining out, back to school, back to the gym, Halloween parties, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, birthdays, Valentines on and on and on"
Finally!
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the COTY board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
"FOMO is increasing, nothing like missing the Cruise Ship."
Thanks DB for upgrade!!!!!!!!! Sentiment is getting better
Let's see if we can hold this above 8.50 for more than a couple days. Through Friday would be nice...????See the tiny little things you ask for when youve been here for a year!!!!!!!9.00 should really be our true support until next ER.
Big upgrade by one of Coty's biggest analysts. $11? Up we go!
A lot of people in this forum say about Sue and JAB. There must be something else with this stock though.
"The fundamentals have not changed - In fact one could argue that they are set up to be even better. And while folks were filling this board up with negative comments, I’ve been quietly accumulating. Thank you for the cheap shares!"
14$ before earnings. mark my word.
Delta airlines post better then expected EPS beat as well revenue beat great for Coty meaning sales in the airports getting better with more people traveling
Where is all bashers ????????
what is driving 6% increase today?
ULTA investor day tomorrow will guide the way higher. 
"Coty is great opportunity.Was Sue right when she exercised options to buy nearly $ 100 million worth of stock? Sue Nabi acquired her massive stake when the stock was trading around $9.70.Coty is demonstrating clear evidence that its fortunes are improving.Folks, COTY has minimal risk downside now!As a part of consumer staples, it is the best inflation play.And of corse there is great upside potential through effective management and new management interventions.This is hedge fund down play before big ride.Downside moves are hedge funds game!(60.11% % of Shares Held by All Insider27.25% % of Shares Held by Institutions)"
"They are going to try getting it to the $6s. Never say never. You will never know in this dirty game of share price manipulation and #$%$ dirty money dealings. I shudder to think if the few coming quarter earnings reports disappoints instead and fails to meet expectations somehow. It went to $7.50 pretty fast. And Sue and the company board of directors all keeping very quiet.And even if the earning reports are reasonably good, look how far the share price has already fallen?.. at the most it will only try to scratch the recent huge share price offering at $8.50. After that don?t be surprised to see it crumbling again. So basically we are all stuck at some losing no mans land?? the opportunity costs are huge given that there are other better performing company shares out there with better potential, even within the same beauty industry and sector. More so in some others."
Ulta guidance is dragging the category lower. COTY longs know that DTC model has been in the works and paying off. Also partnerships with Amazon and other retailers. Good time to look at the pe values of others- COTY is sorely undervalued.
another day in Sue's paradise
November run up!!!Annual meeting 11/4Earnings release 11/8Investor Day 11/18Buckle up 
PAAATHETIC. Let's just agree on that. Still will not sell below $12. Guess that means i will still be here for another few quarters? Hopefully they can move some major retail volume during holidays.

"Patience pays off,Long and strong  "

"I was just at my local CVS. The new merchandising looks terrific! They have also grown to 20 linear feet for Cover Girl and 8 linear feet for Sally Hanson. If you know anything about retail merchandising, it’s all about dollars per square foot. They would not have this kind of placement or shelf space if they were not selling or profitable for the retailer. Long and strong COTY "

I have feeling that Q 3 has been pretty good. USA is mainly open and many other countries also with lots of events and etc. It will reflect to Coty’s revenue in positive way.
Coty is bumping up against its fifty day moving average of USD 8.09. If we can pass through maybe Coty will be in better shape to move forward. Wait and see is the game right now! GLTA here.

The calm before the take off.
I have a sneaky suspicion that Coty may move up from here. How far is anybody's guess.
"Remember, DB raised the KKR sale as a forward, potential negative. No more with its upgrade today lol. Buy the lights out under $10. COTY is the perfect reopening trade."
Seems Coty will prepare to investors amazing News on investor day on 18 of November!!!!!! Even location is different this time hopefully smth positive will happen!!!! I strongly believe Coty worth more then 10$
"Fundamentals, economic outlook, and recent company news is better than during the run up in late April/May. IMO, we should meet or exceed those highs in November. GLTA"
