"Energy sector was strong today and price of crude has been heading up. In addition, In Q4, MMLP stated Q1 is going to be good AND that in Q3 revenue will start to flow from the pipeline project in the permian basin. What investors are buying into is that the dividend coverage ratio will be improved from a strong Q1 and that the dividend will be secure. With that materializing with a solid Q1, investors will be"
"Funny thing is I have a good friend who was a frat bro with Martin, R. He describes him as a very keen always with a plan type guy. Hard for me to believe that MMLP hasn't a plan to succeed. I think they are a good long term bet."
"Does this announcement amount to a 6% div.? If so, I’ll be buying at $2.75 tomorrow AM. Try to average at $3.35 p/s and wait."
Sorry to be a bummer but I just put a buy order in at the next support level $8.00. All longs convince me why I should raise it.
Consistently paid at least a $.50 quarterly dividend the last 10 years!
I'm sure we haven't heard from Giuseppe because he must have had several heart attacks.
"@Buckrig. OK you got me! I was kidding about $5. I really want my avg of $16.68 and then, you bet, I'll bail"
"After hours volume... wonder why? Election related maybe? Been busy today, what’s the news?"
One good note is that the insiders own a lot of stock.......I'm in and hope for the best.
well when are they going to anounce divided?
Hurry last chance to buy before ER!
everyone calm down. just buy more don't sell. please and thank you 
This stock is high risk - but looks like we are near a turn-around. Did what they promised and sold assets that where loosing money. Also looks like business has turned this quater - and there is a good chance they can actually start to make money again this quater. At the same time they deliverage. So - even it is true the high divi signal risc - I took the risc and jumped onboard now to take part of the ride up - together with my dividend and more than 14% - after the reduction....
This was due to happen just based on the insider buying.https://formwhispers.com/s?t=mmlp
I am a little surprised that MMLP is up today instead of giving back .35 or so. Hope resistance is over!
BE CAREFUL
Interesting to see if they used the ONKE check to get out of some of their debt?
@ Jump. No I haven't. I'm investing in IEP and SUN. Had both for some time now and both pay a great cash distribution. Both have weathered the market down side and held their payout. Just waiting on mmlp at $5 and bail time.
"We will see an announcement fairly soon on their refinancing due August. If they are able to do so, I see another upside leg in the making."
This will get better soon
"Okay, folks, this our early Christmas present."
I don't like today's news release. I fear another dividend cut. I hope I'm wrong
Encountering a lot of resistance in mid 13's. That's to be expected. I think it punches through next week.
MMLP is down -4.90% to 14.55
Looks like CEO just bought 5000 shares
You gotta but at this price
"So, it appears the next ex date is Feb.6. I will take advantage of the drop when that happens to buy more. In the meantime, Capital Gains work just fine! In fact the dividend percentage has come down a bit, due to the price rise lately. A win-win for the investors here, for sure!"
Jackie what happened? Why did it drop.
Is Giuseppe buying again?
"Company Guidance 4Q19 versus Actual: Terminalling/Storage: at $11.5m actual/ $11.6m est.. Transportation: $9.1m actual versus $9.2m est. So half their business was down $200,000 actual from guidance. Natural Gas Liquids: $11.4m actual / $10.6 est. Sulfur: $7.4m actual / $4.7m est. Total: $35.5m EBITDA actual versus $32.1m est. MMLP Dec 12th presentation to Wells Fargo forecast a proforma $0.25 dividend for Q419. And their actual Distribution Coverage was above the estimate 1.71x on actual. You can see the problem?"
"Great day. Its not hard to expect strong storage revenues. As an oil/gas operator, I could see their oil hauling profits do well. Our gatherer has been using frack tanks to store oil and sell the physical into the forward months. Its a great physical arbitrage and Im seeing it work. MMLP could do well in this environment, if they are aggressive."
the reason I sold last year at 13.05 was because of the coverage ratio. The “we are doing great and our coverage should increase next quarter” sounded quite familiar to the months prior to the previous cut I suffered through. I am still shocked at the huge drop. It makes me wonder if a significant bounce isn’t coming before it continues down.
"All over the place today, on much bigger volume than the average. No idea what that means, though. Unfortunately."
Mr. Martin just stepped down
"Well good enough. No trading after hours which indicates to me the market is satisfied but not over exited. My best guess, 15.50 to 16.50 in the coming days."
"""optimizing our assets"" must mean they are looking for work. ""optimizing our assets to maximize free cash flow"" must mean they have no money.Yeah, okay, we knew that. C'mon guys. Tell is something we don't know!"
"I think for a lot of MMLP investors that road out the carnage and did not want to take the loss, based on your individual price/unit, like myself, it made more sense to take the 3.5% yield with the new distribution. Kinda like holding a 30 year treasury with maybe some upside potential in the future."
Looks like their Cushing storage contracts will yield strong cash flow.
We on the way to the top!!!!
Good news about the current distribution being held at current levels. Makes me hopeful about earnings and the dcf for the year. Hard to hold your breath till the earnings release and whether to add to my position.
"Very good conference call today folks. One time expenses will be offset by west texas line coming on in Q3 and then larger profits in Q4 with full ramp up in q1 and beyond. Distribution coverage ratio solid at 1x and lots of potential upside. Very conservative guidance which is good which leaves plenty of room for earnings beat. KEY POINT IS THAT Motion for Reconsideration on West Texas LPG Pipeline Rate Update is on the agenda for February 27, 2018! If rate increases are approved.... looks like we will get a very nice lift in revenue and stock should head right back to 19! Hoping judge is fair and allows for rate increases finally after 3 years!"
"MMLP is getting mentioned, the target is $10 hold long term earnings going higher."
They just declared 25 cents for the quarter. Shouldn’t that get us back to at least $5 or $6? Honest question.
"Things are looking pretty promising. Clearly the maintenance of the distribution helped. With cold weather approaching, the next few quarters should be pretty solid. I'm in principally for the distributions, but won't complain about a bit of price appreciation. Will stay the course and judiciously accumulate."
Not the day I thought this wouldBe having
This could be a huge quarter!. GO MMLP. The Transport business will be a great addition to the LP as well.
Hopefully we got our ex-dividend drop out of the way yesterday and will start a slow move upward today.
RSI still only 30 despite the recent uptick. Previously buried at 18. Suggest it's still oversold
"After every quarter's earning report, there are insider buys. This quarter there are NO INSIDER BUYS. Hmmmmmmmmm. Makes you think! I am out and will re-enter at 1$"
Thank you to whoever sold me those shares at 11.93 this morning. Sorry for your loss.

"""The downgrade reflects our expectation that Martin Midstream Partners (Martin) will not be able to refinance its 2021 senior unsecured notes prior to Aug. 19, 2020, which will accelerate the RCF maturity date to Aug. 20, 2020 from Aug. 31, 2023. In our view, Martin will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the $201 million outstanding RCF balance in 2020. Our simulated default scenario contemplates a payment default occurring in the second half of 2020. We assume that due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in WTI prices on the capital markets, Martin will not be able to refinance its senior unsecured notes, which will accelerate the maturity date of the RCF to August 2020. We also expect that the partnership will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the outstanding balance."" S&P"
will buy more
buy low and sell high.
"That ,52 coverage stat scared the  outta of me. I was expecting a huge down day. As long as I can break even with this in 7 years I will count myself as lucky."
I’m riding it out
Hey Buckrig. Been awhile. Vacation in Co spending all that mmlp div! Took about 2 sec. almost out of mmlp stock. reinvested in SUN and IEP. Take a few years to make up the loss but not worth holding martin anymore. Take care my friend!
I will be looking for an S4 to see if the most recent action is related to insiders. It would be good to see this.
"From the partners today regarding the pipeline sale and distribution coverage: ""We believe that with the benefits from this sale, the Partnership is now in a position to take advantage of viable growth opportunities including potential drop-downs from our general partner which could drive our distribution coverage ratio to a target of greater than 1.2 times.""Doesn't seem like the distribution is in jeopardy."
This was $44.xx about 5 years ago................and now it's $12.xxTHAT is not what I call a good investment..............
"MLPa as a whole have performed poorly. And that masks how abysmal MMLP has done. But compare MMLP to the ETF AMLPSept 2015. AMLP $67.10 MMLP 27.70Sept 2020 AMLP $19.42 MMLP $1.22Change: AMLP -71%. MMLP -95.6%Value of $10K invested 5 years agoAMLP: $2900. MMLP. $440. What’s the best thing we can say about MMLP, well they aren’t bankrupt yet! But they have zero influence on their markets. So they depend on the market as a whole. And IMO the energy sector isn’t improving any time soon."
Not cuttin divvy. It’s a winner
The div coverage as per last CC is 1.31. Don't see a div cut coming at all. Insiders bought about 45k shares last Q. Total over reaction. Shorty at work. BRING BACK THE UP-TICK RULE. Would help alleviate some of this nonsense.
insiders sold stock week before collapse
MMLP is going to have a GREAT Q4.... Load up folks. The cold Winter is making for GREAT profits. We will be back to 16 shortly after MMLP announces 2018 guidance on/about january 15
"If next quarters revs/earnings are not enough to sustain a 1.0 dcf for the year MMLP will be forced to cut or eliminate distributions. Sad, because MMLP, up to now, has been a good position for me."
"Just checked before buying. Found a lot of insider ""Buying"". Revenues are stable and high. Divies are wishie washie but are paid. What say you?"
"CEO bought 3000 more shares yesterday Nov 15, so he has bought 8000 shares in the last two days!"
I’m begging to wonder if someone knows something and this will continue to decline faster than the payout.
50 cent dividends looks safe. In 2003 it was 50 cent.and price was 18.
new to mmlp here. bought dec 26 and have enjoyed the ride so far. Is this massive blow due to the butane issue going to cause a short-mid term issue? Is this really anything I should be worried about? 2.2% y/y seems decent to me.
I have 38050 shares that I've had since 2016. I don't even know what to think about Ruben Martin. They are all for sale for $16.68 per. Any takers!!!!
"Amazing! A good day today on good volume. Been a while since that has happened here. Although I feel like I am talking to myself, since nobody seems to post on this message board, except me and LF. Whatever."
MMLP WILL MISS THE EARNING WATCH OUT
Martin Midstream Partners reached an all time low at 1.81
"It's a buy at 5........can't keep this distribution level up......I look for .80 annually from here until liquidation of some assets, which is a mistake IMO. So shareholders have had it good for years and now it goes south."
Martin Midstream Partners L.P is up 10.23% to 3.30
Time to Buy!!!!
What happens AFTER X-div day ?......................
Is MMLP financially positioned to maintain the 1$ dividend?
"Consider: Their most recent power point for their December 11th Wells Fargo Midstream Conference on page 12 states that Dividend Distribution coverage is forecast to jump from 0.84x in Q3 to 1.70x in Q4. I can tell you they would not state that number 75 days into the 90 day quarter if that number was not going to be close. If they are close to this number, it should finally give some confidence into this stock, which has been driven into the ground by not just management mistakes but mother nature (ie: midwest storms that destroyed, yet delayed sulfur demand). Therefore, I don't see the dividend cut at all. If management can stop missing quarterly estimates in the next few quarters that yield per unit is going to be cut in half as the stock rises back to $8. Its worth the risk."
"I am 57 years old and super high dividend stocks are and always will be a mistake to invest in. Unfortunately I needed a refresher course apparently when I invested in mmlp at an average of 25. Any mlp that yields in excess of 8 percent is high yield and risk increases as yield increases. Of course there is a little more to the equation but that is the basic equation. Life experience gives me the odds if I invested in 10 different mlp’s yielding 14%, I would be lucky to have half my money in 10 years, even after Div payouts. One or 2 of the 10 will recover fully in price, the other 8, 2 or 3 bankruptcy. The rest just struggle. Will mmlp be one of the 2 winners in my scenario? Possible but it’s the luck of the draw."
"I’ve got four companies reporting earnings tomorrow. AMD, MMLP, MSFT, XLNX. Who do you think will have the most earnings growth? If I gave you three guesses would MMLP be on the list?"
"Glad I held on when we got close to $4. I still plan to buy more before the next ex date. So far, so good."
"Click above ""Financials,"" then click ""Balance Sheet."" And then you see the amount of common shares, and notice that management has been buying back shares, and thus reducing the dividend payout by share reductions.The amount of outstanding shares in 2014 was 470,943, and the amount of outstanding shares in 2017 was 290,927 shares.Do simple math, the dividend payout is less."
Dividend confirmed.... Price will rise
So are you all expecting earnings to go from -.42 to +36?
I feel about this company like I do COVID. I’m tired of waiting for something positive out of both situations. The current management team has seen the stock price drop 97%. Why isn’t the board doing something?
Freezing weather in NE big storm coming Thursday and energy stocks will just keeping heading north.
I think they will announce distributions after the close. People in the inner circle already know the answer.
Martin Midstream Partners L.P is up 12.37% to 3.18
"Reaching resistance today; I think it punches through, in time."
What a bargain folks.... Lock in before the upcoming x-date.
"MMLP is quite undervalued, if It moves, It will rise UP fast , I keep buying now, buy asap and Hold !"
Is the dividend really 18%???
I bought MMLP in 2004. It was my first MLP. I stay in as long as it keeps making distributions.
The reason the price went down is because the insider buying stopped.https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mmlp/insider-activityThe insider buying is a clue that huge earnings are in the future.That is why Zacks now list MMLP as a strong buy.
Moody's downgrade to b2 causing the reaction/drop in price. A bit of an over reaction. Martin received temporary relief in their bank covenants to be able to invest in the West Texas pipeline. I believe the worst is over and they will have improved results going forward. All oil/energy related markets are strong.
Strong finish. This should flirt with $6 tomorrow
I MENTIONED 1 MONTHS AGO THAT THIS STOCK WAS GOIN3 TO GO TO $1 AGAIN BUT EVERYONE DIDN'T BELIVE ME....
"Well, a week ago I didn't think they would reduce the distribution, but when they said they would announce distribution and results on the 24th...that was a red flag for me. I sold mine on Monday, thank goodness. I've been in and out of MMLP for a few years. I've owned a few MLPs in my time. Seems to me, in the past few years MLPs have steadily losing steam. The only ones I buy now, are the ones backed by larger companies. I owned Dominion and they rolled their MLP back into Dominion and I made out ok. ETP or ET has a con artist running it. I have bought HESM and done well. I purchased BPMP about a month ago, and it really hasn't done a lot, but they keep increasing their divvy and worst outcome BP would roll it up and I'd get BP shares. I'm just saying, don't chase the yield. Buy one that has a major company backing it. Worst case, you'll get shares of that major company."
divvy announced. ...50 cents. .....rise to 15+
big fish. traded 12.5% of its entire float today. another big tomorrow
"DIVIDEND ANNOUNCED!!!! IMO, great time to buy to get upward appreciation and a wonderful dividend! Management already mentioned Q1 is going to be good... I wouldn't be surprised if they raise guidance for the rest of the year to the upper end.... hmmmmm. IMO, be smart and lock in."
"so I see the after hours showing 7.89. At the current distribution, that would make the annual rate at 12.67% annually. Seems ok?"
MMLP WILL GO BACK DOWN TO $10 AFTER PEOPLE'S WILL COLLECT THE DIVIDENDS. THE NEXT QUARTER THEY WILL CUT THE DIVIDEND....
Have been in and out since 2010 but now see a Phoenix rising from the ashes. I jumped in at $3.91 and will hold long and enjoy a dividend north of 25%!!!
I BOUGHT AT 1.12 WILL GO ALMOST TO $ 2 THEN SELL
they want to get it the stock at low price but i think the price is here right
"Oops, they're paying a dividend! Who got baited by Zacks to sell when it dropped to $9?"
"MMlp is about to get 193 million in cash. If they bought 15 million shares they would save 30 million a year in DIV payouts. Instead they will reduce debt and save 16 million a year in interest payments. My numbers may be off a tad but this I should a good question. They only reason not buying shares would not make sense is if they expect the shares to be much cheaper in the future. Why pay off debt at 8% when you could stop paying 15 percent in Divs? Am I looking at this wrong? if so, enlighten me."
Selling assets to maintain profitability? What are they going to have left to sell... lemonade?
"Hmmm, looks like Giuseppe is taking profits again."
Rally time! Need some good news earnings
"They got the deal done!!! Monday will be very interesting! ""Partnership has received the requisite majority consent necessary for the adoption of the proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the Existing Notes (the “Existing Notes Indenture”), which will, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the Existing Notes Indenture, delete certain events of default""."
Since there is no one else to communicate with we can review the current conditions of MMLP.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4363307-martin-midstream-partners-another-distribution-demolished-still-stage-comeback?utm_source=money.cnn.com&utm_medium=referral
Screaming buy or run to the hills?
Just a matter of time for this break out to happen. This sector looks good on all points and the transport business is booming!!!
so why is this thing going up?
i bought yesterday lot of shares ha ha ha
"A lot of interesting things happening here. The last time it closed below $3 was on Aug 10th. The volume has gone from 727,500 on Aug 18th to 54,500 on Aug 20th. On Aug 6th the volume was over a million. As Jim pointed out they have stretched out their debt to make the current looks better. Yet, the price holds above $3.00. It makes me wonder if they really do have a future. Hmm, could be!"
"Are others here dripping the dividends? I am. I find it's a great way to growth my portfolio, especially with a dividend yield this one has."
Great stock for retirees. If stock goes down significently and you need a tax brake sell it BUT MAKE SURE TO BUY IT right back! Do not be concern with NOW The market flucuates and oil and other liquids are down.
American Airlines with a BB rating is selling bonds with an effective 12% yield. Where does that put Martin with their CCC rating? They need some cheap stimulus money. I hope they are successful in getting it.
Make no mistake. Pressure is on with the company debt.
This is not a 5k. It is a marathon that we will win. Just hang in there and await the MLP market to come back full force. and it will. History long memory short. cycles.
Looking good
I’m telling my followers in ST to jump in for the ride up... it’s coming
Take-off time---!!!!!
Which way the Texas RR Commission rule?
"Is this a good time to BUY? If so, why? Price keeps dropping...."
Are partners bailing? Or is the stock being shorted?? How does one find out?
I've owned MMLP on and off since 2013 and have made a lot and lost a lot! I bought in again while checking stocks on the Dividend Channel which is where I heard about MMLP in the first place. It was around October 24th and I checked Analyst Reviews on Fidelity and it was listed a STRONG BUY! So I leaped in again!
@Gary01 Added 5000 more at $4.46
"Could be tax selling. Selloff started on April 11th. We will know in the next few days. Maybe funds shorting against the box to take a tax benefit, only to purchase back within 2 months."
ranks as worst stock Ive ever known. calling SEC today so they can look at price action prior to today.

"For more than a decade I stuck with it and enjoyed the dividends and had hopes there would be a visible upside to the carve outs, even considered to buy more at these levels but today my trigger pulled and a very long relationship has ended."
Hey Buckrig. What's that GREEN dot on the earnings chart. I've never seen one here before!
"me thinks there will be no dividend, uh...no distribution, this next time around. glad I am out."
Reports tomorrow! Could be huge!
Just wanted to say hi to all my friends in here.. things are looking pretty good for us!!
Huge move on good volume today. Looked like a couple of institutions buying. Or it could be good news leaking out? There's reason to expect significant improvement for q4 based on last CC and contango in the oil market.
Results demonstrate the dividend is secure and this is a great price to secure a 14% yield.....
"President and CEO, 10% Owner Ruben S. Martin bought 66 shares for $12.6 per share on Feb. 20. Is that some kind of joke?"
Amazing how a small increase in oil can effect this price dramatically.
"MMLP recently announced improved earnings, and asset sales to pay off debt. Don't understand the recent severe drop in the stock unless the insiders are withholding critical information!"
Dividend is secure and oil and gas are now at highs... COLD weather=great news for MMLP!!!!! congrats longs we will be rewarded very soon.... last chance to get in before we head to 16.
"Loading Loading Loading, Yeeeeha. As always, I want to thank people who sold me these shares at these low prices."
Worked all day on this stock. Very nice profit. Wonder what tomorrow will bring!! Happy Girl
$2.00! Hopefully we have a good solid climb going into earnings. Hopefully we see a nice reduction in debt this go around.
"Why would any bond holder accept 650 per thousand for a bond that you can sell today for 732.50? So does that mean the other bond holders not in the first group of 62% major holders will want the new bonds at 1000? Or does it mean that more than 5% of the bond holders will tender their shares and force BK??? This is why the stock went down 27% today as the stock could possibly be worthless in a reorg. Also the 2/2021 bondholders may be leery of accepting 2025 bonds that come up after the 2024 bonds being used to finance the 650 cash offer. Put yourself in a bond holders shoes and ask yourself, what would you do?"
Looks like dividend is quite secure. I am a buyer.
"KKR acquiring Discovery Midstream for $1.5b, and its assets are in Colorado which is under threat by legislation that might curtail drilling significantly. Makes you wonder about MMLP getting so low it could........."
"It's a solid company, but a lot of fear mongering going around...study the chart pattern, read and understand the company's press releases, financial reports, and buy low (now) and sell high (later)."
Looks like we are having a tough time breaking through this 1.70 resistance level.
Excellent results!!!’

"FYI, Insiders have been buying this stock recently. Since 6-11 thru 7-23, company insiders have bought 44566 shares from a price of $6.81-$6.99. Randall Tauscher (executive VP/COO) bought 20k on 6-11 at a price of $6.81."
It’s coming true
"don't expect dividend to go up any time soon, this company has been bleeding for along time."
"I bailed Wednesday, it will go to $39 now"
"Possible takeover target, the industry is overdue for consolidation!"
Why would anybody sell this stock in the 12’s???
I have been waiting for a while for Martin to show some signs of life.It is so undervalued. It should be $8 by the end of the year. $30 by the end of next year.
This is paying a $2 dividend???
"MTI is expected to contribute approximately $23.6 million and $14.7 million of EBITDA and distributable cash flow, respectively, to the Partnership in 2019, contributing to an estimated distribution coverage of 1.1 times at December 31, 2019.There will be no cut. The MTI acquisition is not the only event that will arise to boost distribution cash flows."
"Good news overall. The bonds are being refinanced/restructured for 11.50% with a due date 5 years out. The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplates the following transactions:• The Partnership will commence an Exchange Offer to exchange the Existing Notes, held by eligible holders of record, for either of:(1) $650 in cash for each $1,000 in principal amount of Existing Notes tendered (subject, along with the Cash Tender Offer described below,to a combined cap of $77 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes, and, along with the Cash Tender Offer, the “Cash Offers”),(2) $1,000 in principal amount of 11.50% senior secured second lien notes due 2025 (the “Exchange Notes”) for each $1,000 in principalamount of Existing Notes tendered, and(3)(a) The right to acquire such holder’s pro rata share of $50 million of 10.00% senior secured 1.5 lien notes due 2024 (the “New Notes”,and the offer of the right to acquire such New Notes, the “Rights Offering”), the proceeds of which will be used to fund the CashOffers;(b) Holders that participate in the Rights Offering will receive Unused Proceeds (as described below) on a pro rata basis based on theprincipal amount of Existing Notes participating in the Rights Offering, and $1,000 in principal amount of Exchange Notes for each$1,000 in principal amount of such holder’s Existing Notes remaining after application of the Unused Proceeds; Unused Proceeds willbe an amount eq"
And I am long.
"Total Over-reaction to moody's required adjustment based on ratio's... Keep in mind, if we get a positive ruling on the court case next Tuesday or positive direction on increase in rates in the near or midterm. Revenue is going to increase dramatically. Buy on the dips folks lock in that 14%! monster dividend which is covered."
The ones that sold last week are already buying back as I have. It was very clear that there would be a cut!
Shouldn’t this stock be $20?
Just checking in!!! We are going up!!!
Near 1.0 dcf for the year might just be enough to support MMLP through the next quarter which is a good quarter for MMLP. Keeping positive!
This is scary with ER and holding.. just scared
I'm hoping to get enough from this stock to buy a gallon of gas for my bike.Does anyone think that will happen?
"Sorry, it's all about FCF coverage. If it's over 1X this quarter with a positive spin, this will move up. The $.50 distribution is a positive until they report."
Wow. Stock drops 5%. Bonds up 8% to the max at the exchange window. Don't know what to make of it - or how much risk to take.

Looks like Wells Fargo his holding on to that $3.00 target.https://www.benzinga.com/stock/mmlp
"BARGAIN FOLKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! earnings right around the corner! Its been a cold, cold, winter folks! We should see a nice pop in earnings! Buy low, sell high!"
"Rubin makes $13,000,000 per year in dividends alone. He is not going to cut the dividend, especially with the accretive Transport acquisition recently completed. There is also the fact that new Permian pipes will soon be delivery large amounts of crude to Cushing storage, which will boost demand for MMLP storage. And there are many other things that will boost the company's profits. Not much longer till we see this, maybe next quarter."
ON THE PATH TO BANKRUPTCY
THEY WILL CUT THE DIVIDEND ....
I read an article about MMLP about how the volume has been so low. I always looked at low volume as a bad thing but this article claimed that the low volume is caused by nobody wanting to sell. I’ve never thought of it that way. Any thought?
Best is in front of us here. The next two quarters are going to be huge.
$4.00 by Tuesday morning
What asset they acquire after the sale of pipeline?
"No news, so I am wondering if the drop might be due to flippers of the 2.6M share secondary offering that went out earlier this week, possibly also in conjunction with peeling off the dividend?"
"Would be interested to hear from Gary01 (or other knowledgeable), to opine about a potential div reduction. How would that Typically affect stock price? I am new to this one and like the potential of s/p growth."
"I realize that not many post to this board, but the price rises here lately are awesome, and on good volume, as well.Very encouraging!"
I've got 30.5K shares at a cost of $600K invested in this company. I'd hate to see another div cut. The price drop is bad enough
Why does Yahoo Fincance often list the wrong dividend amount???
May 2011 the Peter Principle strikes MMLP. The Peter Principle observes that employees rise up through a firm's hierarchy through promotion until they reach a level of respective incompetence.Tauscher promoted from Exec VP in charge of sulfur to Chief Operating Officer of the whole company.Scot Shoup - Ex-Koch - currently Exec VP at a machine shop hired as Sr VP of Operations.Yost promoted to Sr. VP of Terminally & EngineeringMurry promoted to Sr VP of Surfaces TransportationLawrence promoted to VP of Sulfur ServicesRuben - Pleased to announce these strategic changes in our senior management. I believe these appointments position us well for continued growth by leveraging the expertise of these individuals.Stock price then: $38.81. Stock price today: $3.17 Stock appreciation: Negative 91.8%
Should be hearing about the payout in a weak or two. That will certainly get some action; nut the best catalyst will be earnings; I'm expecting an upside surprise.
finally broke through the mid 13's.........nice to see
"Have 7350 shares; down 19k on share price but with dividends, up about 2k total. Average price 13.16. Expect the next 3.6k dividend soon. Overall, I'm on the cusp, but am willing to hang in a bit more. They seem to be aiming for 1.2 coverage, and with the current yield of 14+%, a switch to a similar yield will also entail risk. Basically hoping that the next few quarters will signal a recovery of this in particular and the sector in general. Just need to keep my eyes open."
Everyone waiting earnings
is it time to buy?
"The typical 10 to 15% collapse after the 4% div payment seems to have run its course. Unless oil tanks, it might climb back to 12.75 between now and next Ex Div. As for me, I’m going to take my money and lose it elsewhere. Lol"
You want a nice div.......?....Buy today..........but be wary of how much it will cost you tomorrow.............
Guess everyone's scared away; maybe time to buy?
"My, my. So much bitterness, so little hope.Sure, five years ago it was at 35 and a few months ago it was 90 cents.That was a really bad time for Martin.With oil there is always hope and opportunity.Now is that time. CFRA has it as a buyMarket Edge has it as a buy.Now in AH I see it at $2.45.Looks like it has turned the corner."
"I guess you could look at it this way: at its current price, the dividend (distribution) yield is now over 13%."
"I’m long, a couple days in the green. Oil needs places to go right? Huge dividend here too to encourage long holds... held this one a couple years ago for a while it didn’t perform well, but now i feel better about it."
Someone knows something ---what is it???
"No not near enough. However, I hope they saved one tube of grease for Martin. He's going to need it . Hey Buckrig, a stock for thought. IEP $2 per share distribution. Icahn owns around 95% of the stock so he can pay that kind of distribution. HAD THIS ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND STILL BUYING! Have a good and safe holiday my friend!!!!"
Now it looks like it will be a couple more years before things really look good.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394189-martin-midstream-partners-avoids-bankruptcy-distributions-likely-to-remain-minimal?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha#alt2&mail_subject=mmlp-martin-midstream-partners-avoids-bankruptcy-but-distributions-likely-to-remain-minimal-indefinitely&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-2
What’s moving MMLP up 9% today ? Is there any bug thing happening
I loaded up a couple more thousand shares. buuuuuuut... I can't keep this stock floating on my little pocket change alone.
"Since they delayed the distribution announcement till the earnings call, it looks like they will be cutting, right? ........but how much?"
It appears that the carnage is starting. Down .63. The smart investors seem to be abandoning the sinking ship today. Sad! MMLP was once my shining star for over 15 years.
@Jackie did you keep some of your APPN? It’s having a nice run. I hope it keeps going. Maybe it’ll offset my MMLP.
loaded up 4000 shares at 11.9
Kudos to all of you that added to your or created a position when MMLP was 11.00 and change.
I am happy with the results and will buy more.
"I bought this company based on articles I read from several analysts in March, April, May, and June saying it was set to explode. I bought at an average cost of 2.84 with a 1 year average projected of 400% increase. Now the same people who reported a few months ago are saying it’s projected is $2.00. How do you find news you can trust."
declared 25 cents for the quarter. Shouldn’t that get us back to at least $5
You shorty's...they just declared the .25 div..x date 11-6 payable 11-14.
I’m new to the investment world. Only recently dipping my toe in the water. I bought MMLP because an article end of April was touting it as a good growth stock. I missed an opportunity to sell at 4.69 a few weeks back. I’m nervous I will never see that price again. Your thought?
Way under valued. A multi asset company. 16% div.
"I feel like a genius selling for 13.25, even though I lost a nice chunk of change."
"Ruben Martin owns 6,400,000 shares.....at a buck= 6.4mil at 3 bucks=19.2mil......As of last week 92% of the bonds where exchanged for new notes. I hope everything is good next week...."
"Another great day!! There separate units could do well going forward, especially their sulfur business as farmers gear up to meet the extra demand from China as reported today."
"LOL. Right at this moment, mmlp is one of two stocks I have in the green. And it’s my biggest gainer so far today. Go MMLP."
"I am posting this as an answer to earlier questions. Why do I think they will cut the dividend? Because no MLP ever in the history of Energy MLPs has ever and I mean ever maintained a 25% yield. One of two things happen. Either they will cut or go BK. If the were an upstream MLP managed this poorly, it would have been toast long ago. Since it is a midstream it can hobble along for a bit. I sold at $12 and change when the yield got too high. (Also my catalyst for selling was the yield % getting to high coupled with GS analysis. I spoke with GS energy analyst, and of all the MLPs we discussed that I owned, MMLP was sold immediately after that call. There is no way a 25% yield is sustainable. You should not look at the high yield as a good thing. It is a warning sign telling you to run away. I am not short and have no position in this one. If you want to trade it have fun. If you are buying to hold good luck. There are way better MLPs to invest in for the long haul. Do you really think you have found the 25% yield pot of gold. Guess again."
Sure looks like a bargain to me!
As I said before.... Lots of posts to drive down MMLP.... based on nothing. Listen to coverage ratio guidance on June 30 earnings call. Affirmed distribution guidance both in remarks and in Q/A first question . Affirmed debt coverage and paid down debt with OKE payment. Best thing to do now is BUY because of share price boom upwards when these shorts cover.
What's up with the plummet yesterday and the 5% increase today? Insiders find out the dividend is safe (for now)??
"the insiders sold weeks ago, AND GUESS WHAT? They are buying back! Insiders are buying back stock at a cheaper price. Makes me wonder. I guess markets are rigged."
MMLP seems to have settled down to $7.50 ish. Hopefully returning to the core business model will yield some growth in the future..
negative article by Motley. but I'm holding on. Dividends mitigate drop in SP
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO $ 4 BUT I WONDERING IF THE DIVIDEND IS SUSTAINABLE. IT'S LOT OF MONEY'S. HOPE THEY WILL NOT CUT AGAIN....
Bond holders take note. The 2021 bonds exchange for $650 and routinely sell for $800. [One can also buy at $790.] I sold my holdings and picked up the $150 per bond. I cannot figure why these bonds are selling so high above the exchange pricing. Any thoughts.
"There is a lot of talk on this board of not reaching 1x distribution ratio, but in the earnings call that is addressed very adequately. In fact, going off memory, they stated a significant reduction of tens of millions no longer needed for maintenance going into 2019. Moody's raised its rating to positive a month ago? To me, this stock has a PR problem. And yes, management seems lost with all the assets sales, etc. They react instead of being proactive in building a company. We will see."
New to this forum.....what’s with this guy Giuseppe? Wanna-be prophet?
Pretty amazing Quarter considering all the headwinds.
"Get ready for the next leg up folks... last chance to buy before we go to 19.... 2018 guidance will obviously be positive otherwise they would NOT have made a separate conference call for 1 week later..... MMLP has the dividend covered folks... IMO, last chance to get load up on a 12% dividend payer! Institutions are going to start noticing the Dividend coverage ratio and the Free cash flow!"
Maybe a distribution cut would be the smart thing to do to strengthen the balance sheet. I really wish MMLP and their employees well. I just spoke to a couple of employees about an error on my K1. I sold last year but supposedly the K1 had me still owning shares. They were so helpful and you gotta love that Texas accent!
why is the stock significantly up today. any news?
Nice jump here
THIS STOCK IS ABOUT $ 2.50 FOR MONTHS DON'T MOVE SOMETHING WRONG...
"Actually, the dividend percentage is down to a little over 21%. It was 25% not long ago. I hope it gets down to 20% or less soon enough!"
Considerable insider selling......http://ir.martinmidstream.com/node/15916/html
"So x date is Feb 6th. They will of course cut. So wait, buy after “return of capital” cut. This will hit $2 and change. Buy the dip ride it up on energy sector is underrated, under loved, low multiple to earnings hype."
"Hey Shorty, Why does management keep buying???"
12% revenue growth over 1st quarter 2017...nice*
Listen up boys and girls....CARNAC THE MAGNIFICENT just told me MMLP is going to $16.68. WEEE DOGGIE
Sad day for the stock and Company. I sold for $13 taking a loss at the time of $2 per share. I’ve been second guessing the decision over the past few months but feel relieved I made the right call. Still believe in the company and will buy back in if it hits $6 tomorrow. The dividend will be close to 14%.
I just think he buys at this price and sells at $1.70 . He’s predictable actually
My patience is wavering...
Going to shatter earnings
It's dropping because it's just about time for the announcement of the quarterly dividend. Will they pay? Will they cut? Will it be the $0.04 like many other companies do? Will it be zero? Negative uncertainty makes stock prices go lower.
"Early this morning,,premarket for mmlp hit a high of $5.40/share......Someone knows something is about to happen on the upside. Now today avr. $4.66/shr enjoy the ride to +$5"
"Out at 13.25. Net loss of 14k even after the divs over last 6 years. The reason I sold, usually stronger pre exDiv then a drop of 10 to 15 percent. Oil prices strong, yet mmlp weak. .52 coverage is scary even though expected. With a goal of 1.0 coverage, the chances of another DIV cut is there. Best of luck to the longs. The best part is this year is the last year I need to pay someone to do my taxes because of that darn K1."
"According to the recent ""official"" company press release, the current dividend will be maintained. Click ""Profile"" above,and then click on to the company's website // press release."
Who is holding til $2?
Anyone got a clue as to whether this report is a positive looking forward????
"I just noticed that the ex date is the 6th, and the pay date is the 14th. Awesome! My biggest holding, NRZ, actually takes about a month from the ex date to the pay date, so 8 days is awesome. I will just use the proceeds to buy more. Compounding at it's finest."
this will not last this price
Collected my dividend payout today!
"Our territories have significant overlap with Plains All American (PAA). PAA halved their distribution in 2020 and sold some assets, though they really didn't need to. Sitting on a ton of free cash flow. Makes me wonder if we might just be an acquisition target???"
A lot of things going on . . .https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001176334
Lots of posts to drive down MMLP.... based on nothing. Listen to coverage ratio guidance on June 30 earnings call. Affirmed distribution guidance both in remarks and in Q/A first question . Best thing to do now is BUY because of share price boom upwards when these shorts cover.
remember i told you time to get in it will be double
so anyone know what happened today? ...besides the obvious price drop?
I am going back in at $6 Heavy
Maybe we should celebrate when it hits two dollars. We could all meet at Jim's house and party all night.
"I may be wrong, but I don't think they are going to cut the distribution this quarter. The shares sold by execs were nothing, compared to the shares they still own. Time will tell."
"MMLP stands to benefit as the Midland oil glut moves to the Gulf which has only 300k of additional oil storage at this moment. The 2m bopd pipelines that come in 2019 will move huge volumes to the Gulf that does not have enough storage. MMLP has some storage for products that could benefit, plus transportation. Im long with adding additional positions."
Bought a little more at $12.70. I guess it will go to $12.00 now. Hoping it will be higher in the summer of 2018.
"The stock has gotten KILLED over the past several days, once again and on no real substantive news. I know there are negatives with the Company, but nothing really too bad in the last week. Any ideas why this most recent drop has happened? Institutional seeking maybe????"
I TOLD EVERYBODY WAS GOING AT 11
Sold 163 shares at 5.15 early because I knew it would be a down day today
when are they going announce dividends?
"I picked up 10,000 more shares at 3.99 today. That puts me at 50,000 shares, with an average price of $6.60. Will probably sell today’s 10,000 at $5, just to lock in a short term profit to offset some of the unrealized losses that I may end up having to realize at some point. I expect to buy each time it hits $3.99, absent some new disclosures that change that."
TOLD YOY BE CAREFUL NEXT MONTH WILL BE THE BIG DROP
