"Crucify another unreliable and guesser analyst, Wellington Shields. They downgraded ZBRA without reason a week ago. BTW, need to thank them as I was able to buy the stocks. What are the implications of these guessers or manipulators of stock prices?"
Now THIS is the kind of earnings report I like to get out of bed for!! WOW!! I knew things were looking good for their business but sure didn't see that beat and buyback coming!! Very cool!!
"Consistently strong results and forecast, no slowing down"
Selloff seems unwarranted to me.
The hospital I work at is moving away from zebra handhelds and will be using iPhones for patient identification next year. I talked to a service rep and she said that seems to be the trend...
Don't worry for the short term momentum.ZBRA will go rally at $400 as target.Don't ask. Don't think. Just Buy now.
"6 days ago I mentioned the possibility of this breaking down...and we’re here. So, it should have a steady trek down to about $166 and expect a little chop, then it’ll hit $156 after earnings...that will be the floor. Safe to buy then. I’m bullish long term, but not stubborn enough to hold through the pain. I’ll be long at $156. Take puts into mid august and cash them out at around 160ish. The touch at $156 might happen premarket and it should rebound fast, and you don’t want to be stuck holding those puts on the violent swing this will have after it bounces."
wth is wrong with this
Free cash flow benefiting greatly due to debt restructuring.
"no sweat, up over $220 by middle of next week. RFID approved for AM radio freq. This opens up a lot of new opportunities for the small businessman."
"I used to own shares in Zebra in the late nineties, early 2000's. That was back when it was more of a value stock, with decent growth and little debt. I had rather forgotten about it, didn't even know they bought Symbol, but looked at it a couple of months ago and started nibbling at a few shares. Today they seem to be a great company still, just not a value stock, but a true growth stock with solid financials and opportunities. I'm nicely in the green now. BTW, when I owned Zebra it was in the $50's, IIRC. By the looks of things, I think I'll be holding for a while. I just don't see any big ""why nots"" anywhere. Good luck longs."
Another great quarter from Zebra Tech.
"You know, I love the fact there is not a lot of conversations on this board. This stock is a GREAT sleeper! If the Internet is the equivalent of the Gold Rush then ZBRA is selling picks and shovels!"
"If you're a smart cookie, you will move your chips from MSFT to ZBRA. The cashier needs to lift up the drawer in the cage to access the striped chips underneath the 3% ROI green chips."
Great MF pick. Could have doubled my money if I would have bought it... Congrats to all longs
Bingo!
anyone have any sincere insights on Zebra?
"CEO just bought 14,626 shares Friday at $205.12.http://archive.fast-edgar.com//20190506/AQZSB62C3M22WZKZ28292ZZ2F252Z22RZ2B2/"
"ZBRA down today, the day they released their Global Shopper Study. I think people are missing the point of the study. Seems to me like it provides good arguments for stores to invest in more inventory control systems like the ones sold by Zebra!"
If ecommerce trend going on this one Will jeep rising for long..
