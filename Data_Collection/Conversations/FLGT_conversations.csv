Down 15% in AH's. I guess some investors wanted them to announce a cure for AIDS during the report? And a new fuel for cars?
I believe that the squeeze is in full effect now! Don't be too surprised if this opens at 140 to 150 next couple of days.
GREAT earnings call. Analyst price targets will be raised.
I keep seeing people commenting that COVID is diminishing I believe it will not be the same as last year but this Virus will keeps mutating and get strongerDelta-Virus will be one of many and it will take years to get this under controlExpect the testing to stay around We are going to the Winter time and that means that being closer to Flu season a lot of testing has to be done Today it will drop at the open but it will be interesting to see the closing at the end of the day This is still a company with very positive numbers and out look
Delta variant overwhelming the world right now and only going to get worse. FLGT going to have monster quarters for at least a year
ny making tests compulsory for unvaccinated people everywhere
The 6 Best Robinhood Stocks To Buy Right Now - Check out https://youtu.be/niac0v4RFXs
I honestly think FLGT has a reasonable chance of being a 100 bagger within the next 10-15 years. I bought more this morning and will keep buying. I also like RILY and TDOC long term at current valuations.
"Before any of you who are financially literate take any unnecessary profits, please read or listen to 100 Baggers: Stocks that Return 100 to 1 by Christopher Mayer. It's a very good case study and I think many of you will be able to visualize Fulgent having a similar story from here."
Great conference call. Great management team. Have big confidence in the future. Just picked up more shared this morning… And think will pay off !

Maybe Cathie will finally start a position on the dip.
I just canceled sell orders for $100 and $110. Keeping all shares and staying long.
The return of Covid-19 Delta is making thousandairs of many retail investors. Good for you. I sold this at $120 on the way down and I hope you get repaired for having faith.
Long FLGT
only thing it's trading 50 percent discount to quidel
Tell me again…. What was wrong with the quarterly report? We’re not going to let these day to day traders get in the way… they just don’t get it !!
its all options related
"$500 company! Buying more on dip , huge bargain. Will continue to accumulate until I get 1,000 shares. Will retire with it"
So we got to almost $105 yesterday before folks started a big sell off that brought us back down to close at $100. What say we all hang in there today and hold our shares no matter what and just see how high this thing can go?
"Looks like reporting policies of right wing states are adversely affecting the volumes of FLGT. Fewer testing reports gives the impression of a slowing of testing, but in reality, testing is still occurring but at an unknown rate. Could FLGT fall to $65 then jump to $115 by Q1 22'?"
Buying CSI Labs.
My calls have doubled in value and im still not selling i have confidence in this company and covid is on its way back which means testing will have to ramp up again. GLTA lets keep making money
Bought 550 more shares at 78.8 today. Shorties are paying for my retirement.
Manipulation at its worst. Charlie
Going all in for this Bagger!!
nobody knows
I am buying big this morning . Adding another 300 shares
Up or down at earnings im still gonna hold love this company
@John - your beloved volume is finally coming through today. Everyone can rejoice!
There is so little news on Fulgent. Here is a great recent article that is worth reading. Bullish too. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4442977-fulgent-genetics-buy-if-you-believe-covid-testing-here-to-stay
Well they really missed the numbers Top and Bottom -But they also are gearing this company to be a good growth and money making story -I am staying on board and will not be selling my shares -I will be taking advantage of these prices to accumulate some shares - The future looks bright -JMHO
120 end of week
"Shorts can't be feeling too good about their positions in FLGT. Seems to be a daily grind up in share price. Have the shorts over played their hand here? Very likely they have, thus the slow and orderly covering (so far at least). As we approach the er I think the sp may reach $100 or more. What the shorts might do if the sp reaches an acceleration point is anyone's guess."
Why down????????
first quarter covid revenue was 381 million and was lowered and projected at 418 million for the balance of the fiscal year 2nd quarter covid revenue may have softened but going forward the resurgence in testing as well as school contracts make this a winner
Why go down ? ER look good to me
support me please
"The ongoing correction is a great opportunity to load up the wagon at low prices. Think about it - FLGT is fully hedged against any adverse developments on the market. What would be the main source of any adverse development? Covid resurgence. FLGT would make a windfall on that, so you are fully hedged. If Covid goes away, FLGT still has double-digit growing NGS business, oh and the fact that everyone now knows the company due to Covid testing and it has made a stellar name for itself means more NGS business down the road. Either way a win win."
no volume hope ends 96 $
"Call options are very expensive for FLGT right now. Unless you just think that the roof is going to blow off of this thing, just sell a call. Put in to sell the $110 August strike for say $7-$8 (currently at about $5). Not a bad way to make some money. If the stock gets called away, you have still made 20% from here plus another 8% for selling the call."
should I hold this stock scary dropping almost 10 percent in a day but I feel like this is deff a hold

Shorts right now...
I want to buy eod 15k but afraid about tomorrow someone can give advice ??
Overall it was a good quarter but Zack plucking top rev from the air and we had massive missed.
What happened?
This better be climbing back to 95 or higher.
why the big dip today?
This is the repeat of a coupe of months ago… nothing wrong fundamentally just big momentum money rotation from small / medium hyper growth stocks to big caps. Hold on and don’t let your shares being stolen away from you so cheaply.
After hours is looking real weird right now
Covid testing searches are up on Google Trends.
Won't touch it until it drops under 85.
"I am glad the world sees value in this stock again. It is finally above my re-entry point (103), after dumping in the 120s."

Big picture FLGT is positioning itself to be an absolute monster of a growth stock/company. Very smart people running this company and the acquisition was shrewd. They have a clear vision and just jumped into another huge total addressable market with the acquisition.
This is a $300 stock!
"Investors, FLGT has around $700 million in cash and stocks/bonds. They also have several million in receivables, even if they collect on a fraction of these with cash/invested assets they amount to about $30 of the share price. So even with conservative earning projections for 2022, the PE for the remaining $54 of share price amounts to a PE below 15. This stock should be viewed as a growth stock with solid fundamentals. Short term the delta variant has caused the 7 days average of cases in the US to go from 11k/day to 38/day since last month, with most of the cases coming after July 4th. Unfortunately I don't see people changing behaviors or increasing the vaccination rate much. No sign of flattening in this recent surge, so this likely will continue towards 50K since this variant is being reported as more infectious. I predict more testing until this is reduced again below 15K cases again, with a steady amount of screening testing as well."
"I feel like the universe is setting FLGT investors up for a nice windfall soon. Usually when the short interest is as high as Fulgent's, it's because the stock is associated with a dying business, not one where the core business is growing 170% and the company is approaching half it's market cap in cash. This is going to be fun when the short squeeze starts."
they missed by 50 million and hoping to catch up by year end on testing demand as delta worsens
missed rev by alotttt $153mil expected $198mwill test $60-70
"Shorts reaction to shake you out of your shares; nothing to worry about here, add to you holdings all you can."
"If FLGT drops below $100, I’m going to start buying more shares."
"One thing to consider: non-covid ""core"" revenue include NGS sequencing of covid. I think it should be part of coved revenue because it will track with it the same. This is a significant part of ""core"" revenue that could drop off if covid get under control. That being said, they will still have about 700 million in cash after the acquisitions. They certainly have the ability to continue M&A and a high growth rate but there is execution risk."
Looks like the 50-day is providing meaningful support at the moment. And it’s bumping up against the 21-day.
this qtr sales maybe 300 million again
"thank goodness I sold covered calls at 100. Took one look at the options interest and instantly knew they would keep this baby under 100 by 8/20. long term she's fine, lots of growth vectors in quarters to come"
Nice shake off to get rid of the weak hands today! It helps to build support after a 20% run in the last two weeks. Long FLGT!
AJ111....good call to consider some profit taking prior to earnings. I still have a small core position and will once again being adding as the price falls. FLGT could revisit the seventies especially if there is ever again a market correction.
"funny, depending on where you look the earnings estimate is 2.54, 2.67, 2.81."
Just checking back in. This is starting to look interesting. After I took a nice profit in Feb I moved more heavily into BNTX. I sold out in the $120s and missed the top by a lot.It now seems COVID has a longer life than previously thought. BNTX is golden but this is waking up.
the report they mucked up estimates a d drawing attention away from with it csi
Buying that dip to $90 was a no brainer. This company will be one of the most important and valuable companies in healthcare in the next 10 years. I see this a a 10 bagger within 10 years. Hold in confidence long term.
"Well, I'm now back in the red."
Congrats to whoever bought the dips today
Earnings.....Wow
It says there is a short interest of 29% as of June 30 !Isn't that a huge short interest ??
Makes no sense to me.
How low does this crash this time ?
"Just a reminder to all that growth is never linear. As a stock trends upwards, there are always drops along the way as earlier investors get out to book their profits. But as those earlier investors get out, eager to sell, new investors join the ownership with much a much higher cost basis, and hence, they're not selling anytime soon. We get stronger as the ""weaker"" hands drop out, but the key is: This is a GREAT business, growing exponentially through its core business, and hoarding hundreds of millions of cash as COVID continues longer than expected. I still think it's a screaming buy at anything under $125. And as a bonus, it's also a lottery ticket in case a squeeze happens. HOLD and buy the dips."
I bought this at 44 and sold at 134 and saw it run much higher. flgt is one of the highest short %:stocks and way underpriced I'm thinking about getting back on board with flgt.Btw don't listen to Fernando. hes mentally impaired
"Fulgent Genetics Reports Second Quarter Financial Results Revenue grows 790% year over year to $153.6 million Core Revenue grows 296% year over year to $25.7 million Announces acquisition of CSI Laboratories Announces commercial agreement with Helio Health through strategic investment Announces incremental controlling investment in Chinese Joint Venture entity, FF Gene Biotech"
Well boys and girls the tale of the tape took a bite out of this but don’t despair. I’ve been watching since I sold in the $120s on the way down. I was tempted to come back in the $70s so I missed some of the up. In spite of the negative put out now this could still be a winner as Corona revenue will add more cash soon and that will support a growing base of the long term genetic testing products which are the future. Down the road this still has promise.
This is all negative hype to shake off weak hands from the market.
"I thought the recent run was in anticipation of the upcoming Q2 results, as I have been saying for weeks now that the projected reduction in covid testing revenues was way overdone. But no, it is just the shorts messing with stock once more. They reall are a/holes. Charlie"
"When you know the company and understand the story, it's easy to hold for 10+ years. Most of us here have found the future and we're tempted to book 30% profits?? Lol. We have to stop doing that. IBD had me doing that silly stuff for a long while. I took 30% profits on Facebook and Nvidia when they were both in the $30s even though I thought they were certain to be 10 baggers."
"Again starting to look like another day where we sell off a few dollars in the AM but rally to close in the green in the afternoon. If we do it again, it'll make seven straight green sessions. I love the buying pressure -- all arrows pointing to a three digit share price very soon! GL longs!"
its down due to meme stocks
its a moving targrt
any news ahead ???
Complete and utter freefall.
"The sooner the market realizes this isn't just a COVID stock, the better."
90 next week
Don't be tricked by the shorts. Report was aimed at an analyst's estimate anyways. July 4th was launch of Delta widespread so Test sales will be growing again. Be smart. Shorts are pouncing to create fear to get weak hands to sell so they can cover. Great growth company long term hold.
Let's push this over $100 (and stay there).
cancer diagnostic a 200 billion market in usa alone
Next time to buy is late October. It will probably be in mid $70's then.
Time to cross that 100 level again
"So I’ve made a decision to keep all shares until $150 and then shed 20%. If it goes down before then, then it’s ok bc I believe it’s a solid company and most of you know all of the other positives. At $150 it will become more than I’m comfortable with as a percentage of my portfolio. Any perspectives from other long term investors are appreciated."
I am not saying this would hit $150 but it can and is poised to. The earnings weren't bad TBH this company has 0 debt which is an amazing feat in in this industry where R&D is a key driver. It surely has the potential to break new highs.
"Weak hands are selling into earnings, as happens all the time. I bet we will have blowout earnings!"
"Here’s the deal. Covid cases are approaching peak pandemic levels. Going into winter. Covid revenue will likely return, and weekly MACD bull cross says bullish intermediate term (next 4 months or so). This stock is gonna recover and shock naysayers"
"Nothing surprising in the report. Nothing has changed. Target price of $120 for sometime in 2021 is still intact. What has changed is 2022 is guaranteed now to have similar growth as 2021. (DO NOT INCLUDE or think of COVID testing into any hope for an extra valuation for the company). As I posted last week and suggested for longs to take profits, FLGT is now close to being fairly valued for 2021 at about $3 billion (please refer to my post).2021 outlook is as follows:For the full year 2021, Fulgent expects: Total Revenue of approximately $800 million, representing growth of 90% year over year Core Revenue1 of approximately $110 million versus previous guidance of $100 million, representing growth of 201% year over year GAAP income of approximately $12.00 per share Non-GAAP income of approximately $12.50 per shareI still think they would do $125 million for core non covid testing, but lets go with their outlook of $110 millionTotal GAAP earnings is $360M ($12/shr * 30 million outstanding) from their $800M revenue.That would make the GAAP earnings for non-covid to be at about $49.5 million thus making the P/E to be about 62 (based on $3B market cap). PEG = P/E divided by growth = 62/90 = 0.7 (based on 3B market cap or a stock price of $109).For PEG to be at 1, and hence FLGT at fair value the market cap to be at $3.5B or appx. a stock price of $120/shr.Hence, nothing really has changed and the price target of $120/shr by sometime in 2021 is the fair value.The only thing that has changed is the strategic purchase the company has done to position itself to maintain its growth of core revenue and earnings in 2022 and beyond.The stock maybe trading in the low $80's/high $70's again in the short term which should be viewed as as gift if that happens for all hard nose bargain hunters.Price target for 2022 is yet to be seen once Q4 earnings come out , but for 2021, $120 is set.If you are the kind of long term hoder who just enjoys watching (BUT NOT ENJOY USING) their money grow and never sell to enjoy the gains to improve the quality of their lives, then hold on and your money will grow tremendously. Otherwise do take profit as the stock nears $110-$115 and enjoy life (assuming you bought in the $60's and $70's back in May).Take care everyone"
Blackrock owns now 10.5% of shares. Seems to be a good sign.
NYC area and LA both require vaccines or weekly tests....both are FLGT territory contracts$$$$$$$$$$$$
the whole world is one big mess
We did not get much information about CSI. How much did they pay? I read at another chat site that annual sales are around 63 million. Not sure if that is historical or next years forecast. The market must have anticipated a big announcement. Maybe a public company purchased with cash and stock. Ming is a builder. He is going to build on the Fulgent foundation. Might be faster although riskier to buy more revenue but not his style. The non COVID business can not be built as fast as the COVID is diminishing. We will see if CSI is the right building material. I like the idea of adding something that compliments existing business and as well compliments what is purchased
the stock should be trading at 390 at least and long term worth 800
ahhhh ya just got to play the silly hissy fit selloff game and buy more. Probably rebounds before the EOD.
delta variant testing going up with schools reopening
"No Hurry to buy back in. No catalyst to move share rice forward until at least next QR when outlook for 2022 after covid revenues will be better known. Buying now will only be an investment in ""dead money"" until November report. It won't move much until the week before Nov QR as has been the history. May see a bump in testing this quarter because of Delta but it is already factored in by the Street and hedge funds. They want to see where its headed next year, as do I."
I picked up my shares at $93.28...looks like it may go lower but I am happy with that price
its probably a 400 to 500 price stock not 93
Look at how much they lowered the earnings call expectations because they thought COVID is going away. Well it’s not if they can beat it and turn around test sales plus the come back of their genetics revenues this is going to rip even higher
All analysts are raising their price targets!! good sign when the report was spun as negative because of the covid numbers.
"17M float, 70% absorbed by insiders and institutions = 5M shares. there are 5M shares short.Institutions have increased their buying of FLGT. 94% ROE and plenty of cash in the bank. P/E of 7.This should be bought with both fists."
It will be at $130 by Friday

patients guys great company no debt great pipeline great horizon ahead 100 $ easy by and of July. it's all about shorts
"not that I put much stock in MF articles but i think this guy has it right.....""Fulgent stock is incredibly cheap right now at just 6.5 times earnings. Its enterprise value is also far lower (the lower, the better) than its market cap of $2.773 billion due to the company having no debt and more than $773 million in cash on hand. Its non-COVID-19 gene testing revenue also grew by 296% year over year to $25.7 million in the quarter, so there's something to fall back on even if COVID-19 testing is no longer in demand. Overall, consider the sell-off as an opportunity to buy the healthcare stock on the dip."""
"Is anyone more annoying than ""Anonymous""? I mean, I'm high and long on FLGT, but stop with these fluff posts already, please!"
"The current extreme volatility (going from $98 at one point on Friday to $87 today) is a boon to a patient investor. I've bought the dip today, averaging down, and very happy about it. There's absolutely no reason why FLGT should tank. The winter is coming, whoever wanted to get vaccinated already got vaccinated. % wise in population, the hold-outs are so many and so dug-up due to the whole vaccine discussion being politicized, that the caseload among them and the resulting need for continuous testing will drive FLGT's supposedly one-off Covid testing revenues for quarters to come. All the while FLGT's management uses the proceeds from the windfall wisely, boosting their NGS business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. What's the bear thesis here, really?"
"What a time to get in. The federal, state and local mandates are forcing vaccines...or in small print frequent testing. This increase along with the variants coming along are going to boost earnings and we will see a significant pop coming. In addition the growth of the other sectors make this a great long term investment."
"I think market too short term focused covid testing will generate some revenues but it will be lumpy, u have to look at core 200 percent growth"
https://covid19.lacounty.gov/covid19-news/la-county-transitions-covid-scheduling-platform/
"Short interest has declined but remains 25% of the float and 16% of the total; meanwhile, the SP is climbing in advance of the August 5 earnings report. Add the mounting concern about the delta variant and I think this is one where the longs will carry the day. Back to $120?"
Everyone knows the next earnings will be an insane blowout. If it#$%$ the 80's today I'm doubling down.
They had some interesting insights about FLGT on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Do I sense an imminent short squeeze?
"AJ111.....where are you? If you still own FLGT would like to know your thoughts since the price is now at $95. Your analysis has been among the best concerning the stock.There have been many mindless comments made here the past several days that add no value to investing. Just wondering if some of the long term investors are still around, or sold during the recent rally? I have trimmed back my position by about 30%, but only because I had too much."
Qtr 2 earning will likely be a miss....but guidance is what propels these biopharm stocks. I can't see with the mandates of testing in both NYC and LA that they won't see huge potential sales. Maybe a little stumble at earnings but you can't deny that Variant Delta is ramping up testing needs again and FLGT pps went crazy the first time.
Most stocks go down after Earnings Reports. I’m buying more tomorrow.
Bottom of the new channel is right around 90.50. I added here feel pretty good about a quick run up tomorrow
Missed on the company's own estimate on both revenue and earning by about 24% or the second quarter. It is credibility issue. How could investors trust the company's. new guidance this quarter and beyond?
Just entered into $FLGT today but have been following it for awhile. I’m also long on $HGEN for COVID treatment to prevent respirators EAU announcement due any day.
"Another green close gives FLGT five in a row. Rapidly approaching a new 3 month high at $98 intraday, $95.68 close. Would set off more than a few ""upward trend confirmed"" alarms in the short camps. GL!"
The shorts just sent us to the poor house on less than 1 million volume.**THAT** is why volume matters.
my target price is 500
"i think QDEL results was the problem, covid-19 tests dropped"
"The risk/reward is clear. $40 or so of the current price is accounted for by cash on the balance sheet ($1bn and counting). Unless the market is completely #$%$ the share price cannot go below that floor. The remaining NGS business, with projected sales of roughly $100m a year only needs to account for the remaining $1bn to get to the current valuation. From what I recall, PEG, is around 0.7 which reads significantly undervalued. So even if you discount the remaining Covid business to 0, you are already buying the NGS growth business on the cheap, for PEG of less than 1. And assume Covid business does not go away, and it keeps generating sales for a number of years. At what? 70-80% net margins that FLGT has? My point is - you can only go from $75 to around $40 in the worst possible nuclear scenario. In a realistic scenario, you should be able to get to $100-120 when PEG is normalized at 1. In an optimistic scenario, where Covid testing stays (to what extent it stays is anybody's guess, obviously), we go even higher from there. A bit of an asymmetry in the risk/reward trade-off, perhaps?"
"Posting this out here so everyone can see. LAUSD does NOT use Fulgent COVID tests. They use 2 tests from 2 manufacturers. One of them is named SummerBio, which is a company based in California which provides the nasal swab PCR test, and the other manufacturer provides saliva based PCR test named Clinical Reference Laboratory, which is one of the largest CLIA labs in the nation, that uses the CODX test to make their saliva test."
Be nice if they announced a share buyback with some of their cash. That would confirm at least they think the stock in undervalued here.
"This stock will bounce back to $100, easily."
At $96 in a hurry this morning! Over 200K in volume too. Shorts just might be starting to sweat a little.....
Thank you to whomever just sold me your shares.
"A little disappointing but we’re not in it for one quarter. Maybe the traders are but not the investors. The acquisition and the partnership show management is focused on using its balance sheet properly to fund exceptional future growth for years to come. We’re in this for the future of NGS, which is growing superbly. Still holding with a 10-15 year view."
"I can see the Covid business generating at least $100mm each quarter for at least the next four quarters. With NGS at an annual run rate almost reaching $130mm starting with next quarter's $32mm estimate, I think Fulgent can continue it's acquisition spree from new operating cash alone, which should be at least $75mm a quarter. That's a lot of ammo for M&A activity. They are set up to be a major consolidator in the space going forward. That $777mm on the balance sheet (minus the CSI purchase) may not be needed until it's time to do a BIG deal. As optimistic as ever, especially since Fulgent will get a higher multiple on any revenue they aquire from acquisitions than the multiple they will pay to acquire the business."
Ouch
A sleeping GIANT of a stock/company. I’ll see all you longs at $500+ in 5 years
Fulgent Genetics is up 9.21% to 83.34
"Anyone know why covid tests are sent to a lab for analysis and then on to Fulgent, even if the tests are negative?"
FMV for FLGT may be $5B.
"New daily US COVID cases (using a trailing 7 day average) were 13,423 at the end of June. Yesterday (a mere 28 days later) that number jumped to 66,898. From the end of June (13,423), it took 14 days to double (to 27,751). From that day, it took 11 days to double again (to 56,897 on July 25th). In the 3 days since then, that number is up 10,000 cases to 66,898 yesterday. Cases are EXPLODING and currently showing no signs of slowing down. But COVID cases are NOT FLGT's primary business, but the company had predicted a sharp decline in testing in Q2+, which is looking premature. The end result? Lots of extra cash in FLGT's coffers compared to expectations. Use today's dip to get yourself in the game before results come out on August 9th and, hopefully, this stock heads to its true value of $130+ (a nice 40% bump)."
"With the current volume and bullish flow, we can aim for 110+ today. Hold strong"
"This is about to absolutely skyrocket with that earnings report, especially considering the fact that they didn’t expect covid testing to increase"
FLGT is a covid stock right now....in the future a much bigger player but now the money is being made on COVID testing which is ramping up again. Also a big friend of the Dem party leaders. I predict that Fulgent products will gain more acceptance around the country and guidance due to Delta Variant will be very strong. History has shown that guidance for these Pharma stocks is the main driver...get in now because after earnings this may really pop.
"A hundo per share on the close! I'll take it, but IMO we're just getting started to even higher levels here... holding on to my shares."
KEEP HOLDING YOUVE DONE IT FOR SO LONG. JUST WAIT TILL POSITIVE EARNINGS
I will keep buying sell me your cheap Shares! Think long term! Its a genetic testing company not just COVID!! So much growth!
"FLGT is rated ""strong sell"" by Zacks due to declining expectations."
"Just a few observations this year:0) Market goes up because economy is going to grow fast, covid is not a concern, inflation is not an issue (Jan-Feb, 2021)1) Market sells off because economy is growing fast, inflation is rising and of concern (March-April 2021)2) Market rebounds because economy is growing, inflation is not a concern, covid is not a concern (May-June 2021)3) Market sells off because economy is not growing fast, inflation is not a concern but covid concerns are back.If market was a human being, it could solidly be viewed as being psychotic schizophrenic with signs of manic depression.LOLP.S - Hang on to your hyper growth stocks such as FLGT, and dont let the market elites take them away from you cheaply."
"JV with the Chinese firm a net Negative. What proprietary info will they have to give up? The CSI acquisition is smart as mgmt knows this is peak earnings for covid testing and will decline from here. They have to find other areas of growth. Probable it will fall back to $75-80 as that is the known value of support from non covid core business. Not known at this point if CSI is net negative or positive. Revenue Earnings great, but not really more than expected. Long term this is probably all good except the jv, but it will take a while to prove it and covid will be down going forward. Expect short and intermediate sp pressure."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Fairstox.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Post and Pre-market are hilarious. The past few days during this run aftermarket and pre-martket, crazy reductions happen all at once, never can I buy shares at the prices shown. I've put buy orders in and get nothing at the existing prices, they don't fill. Let's go to 100.00 tomorrow!"
"Sold out today at $110 before close. Traded this company a couple of times and never had more then $15k invested and most of the time less and ended with a $15k profit or 100% of peak investment. Think it will move higher at ER Monday and I will miss out, but am happy with a 100% gain. This last trade had me in at $99 and I've been waiting patiently for several months. First trade was in at $44 last Dec and out at $130 in March. Missed the peak but patience works."
One thing about this stock that no one ever mentions is the over head resistance. There are a lot of investors in this stock that likely bought in the 130 to 180 range. They have been underwater for some time now. Most are looking for a chance to just get even. This is a major factor as a stock tries to move up. Will likely be a drag on sp going forward.
"As AJ111 has pointed out in this thread before, this was a fair value $130'sh stock, and that was before the return of US COVID cases (and honestly, it also ignored FLGT's cash hoard). It's hard to imagine that this isn't a $150 stock UNLESS you've become used to the $70'sh share price. In that case, you might see $92 and think ""Wow - I should sell!!"". Don't let the big guys steal your shares from you for so little. Hold tight and wait until this makes it MUCH closer to fair value range (I'd say at least $120... at least at that point you're not leaving much upside on the table)."
"Volume is incredibly low today... the trading day is almost over and the volume is less than half an average day (still under 400,000), which means very few of the shorts, if any, have been covering today = big volume (squeeze) still to come if we can get this price higher and force some margin calls"
"FLGT holder here, making moneyyyy"
"Listening to the earnings call. ""Dramatic increase in testing"" and secured the contract for schools in NY. Who cares if they missed revenue, growth is set to explode in the upcoming quarter. I sold most my position before market close and kept a small amount. I feel very good about the continued business FLGT will do in genomics and their Covid-19 testing. The only reason I sold any of my position is because of typical overreactions."
"Several months ago a self described ""expert"" on this company when it was trading at $140 after falling from $180 said there is resistance at $120/share and it will be tough to buy below that level. Probably safe to start buying at 120. If it falls to $110 step up buying as you are getting a huge discount. If it falls to $100, back up the truck and buy hand over fist as it would a huge deal. Of course it did all that and then continued to fall to mid $60's. If anyone listened to that sage advice on here you have seen nothing but red ink since and need a bounce from here to break even. Point is that if you listen to anyone's advice on here you should not be investing in single company stock and would be better served with an index fund or bank CD's. Do your own homework, form your own conviction, decide when to get in and when to get out."
What to expect today b4 earnings wise people?
"There is a big disconnect. The push is for increased vaccination and proof of vaccination, not increased testing. Last fall there was no approved vaccine. Now, it's proof of vaccination or proof of a negative test. It's not both. A free vaccine or continuous out of pocket testing. You do the logic and see which side diminishes."
now i gotta buy more
"Reading the CC transcript, I came across the following gem:""So your second question was on M&A. We specifically focused on oncology or a more broad area. I mean, obviously oncology is of particular interest to us. You can see by the moves we've made. That said, no our M&A strategy is going to be broad. It's going to be broad, it's going to be bold, it's going to be aggressive and fast. We are looking forward to deploying this capital and continuing to leverage the technology platform to bolt-on tuck-in these acquisitions in a meaningful way.""""Broad"". ""Bold"". ""Aggressive"". ""Fast"". Management is building FLGT's Core business like bats from Hell. It is no wonder the PPS is strong despite the short-term COVID revenue shortfall. FLGT is a winner."
"I note in the last pisting that Citadel has chunk of FLGT stock. Now there is a manipulating bunch if ever there was one. They will push the price up and down at will. This, I believe, is why the stock price is not being fully realised. All in my humble opinion. Charlie"
"P/E 5. Ok go ahead and sell, You can go buy Tesla at P/E 380."
"LA Unified School District just said they're going to REQUIRE weekly testing for EVERY teacher/student. Does anyone know if Fulgent provides those tests for LAUSD? I know Fulgent has a contract with LA County, but curious about the School District...???"
"enter food establishments, mall, or public venues without proof! Also after speaking to a colleague in NYC who works for the feds, they have put off any decisions to return in office barring testing or vaccination....very interesting!!!"
pcr testing booming for years
I hope it's okay to buy this around 89. Let me know if you disagree.
GREAT earnings call. Analyst price targets will be raised IMO.
"Another nice trading day for FLGT ... 4 green candles in a row (even in a choppy market), and there does seem to be some constant buying pressure lately to help fuel another leg higher."
I just want stock price to go up like moderna I don't care if it's delta lamba that cause cases to go up
Anyone has any info on the latest short interest for Fulgent?
covid cases up
"Still learning the ropes on investing and trading. Before the earnings report, I read quite a bit about a possible short squeeze, but not much since. I think a lot of folks thought the stock price would continue to fall, but perhaps due to the acquisition and helio deal, the share price has recovered quickly. Is a possible short squeeze still in play?"
Just purchased 250 more shares.
Fulgent Genetics is up 8.75% to 109.25
LET HER RUN BOYAS AND GIRLS!LET HER RUN!FLGT BACK TO $110+ WE GO!COVID WITH US FOR YEARS !GO FLGT!
"Time and time again, we'be been told to consider the Covid testing revenue stream as a one-off and disregard it in valuation. Yet Covid cases are on the rise and it doesn't look like the virus is going to dissipate any time soon. After disappointing Q2 results, the management has duly low-balled the Q3 guidance. With Q3 results in, I expect the exact opposite of Q2, and a massive earnings beat. I am buying the dips, and consider FLGT my best hedge against the upcoming long Covid winter season."
There's only about 30 million shares of this stock. That's low. Shorts are playing with fire.
"They said they will have 1 billion in cash soon. Imagine if they just bought back stock with that. That would put market cap at 1.7 billion and a p/e in the 2's. To bank that much cash in less than 2 years shows these guys are efficient operators and can scale rapidly with margins intact. At that market cap the NGS business alone would make it cheap. Not to mention, covid is not going away. It's rare to see a virus gain fitness through variants like this. covid tests will become part of standard of care anytime someone comes in with cold or flu like symptoms. The CDC will most likely demand variant testing to continue to monitor the viral evolution. You would be crazy to bet against this company."
Maybe somebody can explain how this stock swings.
is there a audio feed for announcement?
How much did they pay for CSI?
"So this is getting very interesting…. We’re at a monumental point, I think this one will Rocket after earnings, what’s the word from the wise on this board?"
"COVID cases hit a 7 day trailing average of more than 97,000 yesterday. 16 days ago the number was only 37,000. It's exploded over the past two weeks and is still increasing, which means COVID testing is here to stay for the remainder of 2021 at the very least. FLGT, in its projections, had COVID testing greatly decreasing in the 2nd half of 2021. We have already seen how much cash this company can mint when there is a lot of COVID testing. Full speed ahead, longs. Hold, hold, hold! I just bought in again at $105.40. Expecting $120 within a week."
"If Fulgent goes up 100x in the next 10-15 years, what are you going to do with the money if you sell at that point? No negativity please. For optimistic people only. I'll start... I'll take a small piece and buy a four-year-old Corvette and put the rest in ARKW, assuming it's still being managed properly. Of course, if I see other potential 100 baggers, I'll invest a little there as well."
price collapsing. It may have a PE less than 1 after next earnings.
What’s your price prediction for End of Year?
what do u think of the mu variant
Options expire tomorrow
I was expecting 225 million and 1 billion upward guidance
"This is NOT about having the cheapest cost to produce cannabis ....... or having the highest quality........... it’s MUCH larger than that. I will not tell you how I know what I know ......... FLGC will quantum leap everyone in aiding pharmaceutical breakthroughs in treatments of almost every problem the human body encounters. Forget about the obvious observations of cost........ they will assist with proprietary technology that will propel the stock to levels you can’t imagine. When the REAL reason for the sudden stock price rise comes out, this will make CSCO in June of 1990 look like a bad investment .... or Chipotle with their simple Mexican food chain........ or WalMart on it initial public offering."
"Wow - that ""SimplyWallStreet"" article on FLGT appears to have been written by the most brain-dead investor ever. There is zero content of value in that article. The author states what he thinks ""fair value"" is, but provides ZERO insight on how he came up with the number. He also focuses on how FLGT's business is about to shrink, but that's missing the entire point of what FLGT is as a company. It's not a COVID play that is about to shrink - it's a genetic testing company that is growing its core business by 100% per year and will be sitting on $1B in cash by year's end. Any analysis that ignores these facts is one done on a high level using inappropriate metrics."
Jennifer Nuzzo just covered covid 19 on Bloomberg testing for covid regardless of vaccinated should increase going forward.....hmmn
buy back the stock they can buy 10 million shares
I heard about FLGT the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
no one knows until earnings day they miss big time
why quidel is 5 billion cap I guess Chinese discount
"Fellow FLGT longs - a word of caution prior to the earnings....And an advice for those who want to listen: Consider taking some profits. And here is WHY.3 months ago in May I posted here in real time the following when the stock was at $66/shr:======OK...this is the right price now for anyone who is a hard nose bargain hunter.. at $66 and change, FLGT is literally being given away to you for free comparing to the imminent massive gains you will have in about 4-6 months from now... PEG is now close to around high 0.3. This does not mean we wont see lower prices but at this point it really does not matter whether you buy now or wait to get an additional 5-10% discount for in the end you are going be making 120%+ gain in the short term.... Why is that?The irrational exuberance the market is having with cyclical stocks and what is referred to old economy value stocks (i.e. utilities, energy, consumer staples, etc.) is now well into deep insane territory. Growth stocks - and especially the profitable ones - (the likes of FLGT, HALO, UPST, RVLV, NTRA and many many others, et. al.) are being thrown other the door in favor of buying utility stocks?!! Why? Because inflation has risen to 4.2% and this is a HUGE surprise to everyone?! LOL.Without getting into much details, all I can say and that is just my views, you will forever remember May of 2021 as the month that retail investors could buy premium growth stocks which are going to take over the U.S and the world economy for massive productivity, and disruptive new ways of doing business in healthcare, finance, and other sectors of the economy, at pennies on the dollar. Just remember you read this here (as I am sure others will also start saying as sanity will come back to the market). :)-========Earlier right after Q1 earnings report had come out I posted the following in real time right here:*********Great report! FLGT is a screaming buy at this point. And here is WHY:Firstly, ... So... I was right! :)- At the end of February and then in March I posted here and said the following:1) $100 million revenue in 2021 for non-covid testing (while they ahd forecasted $70 million)2) I said Share price would be cut to low/mid $70s or a market cap at around $2-$2.5 Billion.3) I also said Majority of revenue from covid-testing would be in Q1 and dropping sequentially.4) And I said BANK ON FLGT's Great management team.SO now that the earnings report is out based on above where the stock will be at the end of this year?Discount everything that has to do with covid-testing and consider the $730 million revenue as just one time booking. So we are left with $100 million in non covid testing.1. In my view FLGTwill do $125-$135 million in non-covid testing (probably more but I do think it will be $125-$130 million for sure). THis is based on what we see with all other precision medicine companies and the rate of demand and growth. Also they said on the CC The NGS revenues for Q1 a little less than $16 million and less than $1 million of that came from the CDC. This implies as covid testin revenue is going to drop sequentially, the NGS revenue is going to increase sequentially.2. The question becomes how much of this $100 million revenue translates into actual earnings. The projection is $380 million profit based on $830 million revenue. So if we do the simple math of taking the percentage of non-covid vs. covid, i.e. $100/$830 = 12%, and if we assume 12% of the $380 million profit is attributed to non-covid then we are left with $45 million profit from $100 million non-covid testing.This makes the P/E (based on market cap of $2.1 Billion as of today Thursday May 6, 2021) to be about $2.1 billion market cap divided by $45 M = appx. 46.So now lets see with PEG (Price to earnings ratio to earnings growth is). The earning growth as a whole is almost at 78% ($380 in 2021 vs. $$214.3). This is also true for non covid testing earnings growth YoY (at the minimum). Thus making PEG = 46/78 = 0.59PEG = 1 >>>> stock is fairly valued.PEG < 1 >>>> stock is undervaluePEG > 1 >>>>> stock is overvalued.Clearly PEG being at 0.59 (strictly from NGS) implies at a market cap of $2.1 billion, the stock is VERY CHEAP and a SCREAMING BUY.For PEG to be at 1, market cap needs to raise to $3.5Billion (thus making P/E to be at 78 and hence PEG = 1).And based on 30 million outstanding shares, it would mean a fair value for FLGT stock is at around $120. This is strictly based on their core business of genetic testing which the market would consider (the covid testing is viewed as one time temporary revenue).As such FLGT is a screaming buy with the target price of $120 per share.Best wishes to all****So now as we are at $110/shr and very very close to the target price of $120 based on what I had noted above,it maybe time to start taking some profits. Best wishes to all."
"If anything, the last 3 trading sessions have demonstrated that the market still thinks of FLGT as purely a Covid play. Delta scare goes up, FLGT goes up. Delta scare eases, FLGT goes down. This is a great opportunity for any investor who has spent at least two hours studying this company and understands the implications of its NGS business and that FLGT does have a bright future beyond Covid."

This was $183+ 5 months ago. Short sellers took it down 65%.This Co has a lot of potential & should have never dropped below $100.
Time to ride this back up to $170 again.....first time in at $40's out at 160's @4k sharesback in at $84@2500k shares expect this to go to $150 minimum here in the next monthsthis is a money maker with a huge short squeeze coming
"I just don't understand who is selling in this market? If you're a long term holder, you hold. If you're a short-term profit taker, you probably bought in the $70's, $80's, or even $90's, and thus, you shouldn't be selling now. But at $76 for FLGT, I was thrilled to sell many of my other holdings to stock up on FLGT."
Does this company ever come out with ANY news......
"(APLIF)$0.52-- MCap $32 m--Covid PHASE 3 readout expected THIS Quarter /Drug partnered with Dr Reddy / UNKNOWN stock =1000% ++ opp like NVAX or MRNA """"We are encouraged that an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board has recommended continuation without modification of Appili’s ongoing Phase 3 PRESECO (PREventing SEvere COVID-19) trial evaluating Avigan/Reeqonus (favipiravir).

Yawn.. so tired of insane overreactions
but who knows it maybe good longer term q2 bad but q3 and q4 will be good
"My takeaways from Q2- NGS (now called Core) business did great, an acquisition of CSI will further add to growth in that segment. Great news. Covid testing tanked and missed the revenue target by a large margin. Result: as market still sees FLGT short-sightedly as a Covid play, we'll go back to $90s, possibly even $80s short-term, which is as much as the NGS business can support for now. Great opportunity to load up, in other words"
don't buy options or on margin cases are going up means more testing
"Wish I had researched this junk a little bit more.I wondered why it had a low PE ratio of 6...The reason is, earnings forecast for 2022 is less than $4/ share, which should put share price roughly between 40 and 80."
"Covid testing is continuously increasing at rapid numbers! When someone tests positive and announces it to family, friends & work associates, everyone who came close to that individual will get tested. This is happening all over the country! Covid testing will continue to increase rapidly!!"
This should be here (or higher). Dropping into the $60's was ridiculous.
Positive earnings + delta variant concerns + shorts = 150+
Abbot just announced it was laying off hundreds from their COVID test labs. Saying the orders have died as business and testing at public sites end.
Rockting soon
I'm going with the run will start at 2:30pm!
Apple requiring employees to show if they've been vaccinated or tested....bullish
"The vaccine stocks are tanking because research out today concludes that vaccine booster shots are not recommended. It seems like FLGT is tanking along with them, even though it's not involved with vaccines. That makes absolutely no sense, but the stock market often makes no sense."
Fly baby fly!! And it’s back !! Destroy the shorts please
