TV news just reported CCL to require masks till end of year on all ships and they canceled 4 cruises out of Australia
Check options and you will see todays closing price. Easy trade. Enjoy.
"Come on with the buybacks, how oversold can we get"
"Bahamas, including ALL private cruise line islands just released a statement saying that no ships will be allowed to dock if anyone 12 or older in unvaccinated on the ship. The entire ship will be denied access."
This looks like my CCL stock….it’s growing and growing making me tons of disposable cash! I can hire even more shorts to do my landscaping….hahahaha
410 ships already sailing with another 190 joining this month involving 90 cruise lines means that 50% of the global fleet will be sailing by the end of August. Source: cruise industry news.
Mr. clean deleted all of his messages! What a fraud! Very very wrong
"Pre-cruise testing & mask requirements extended: In addition to last week’s announcement that pre-cruise testing will be required 2-days before effective September 19, we have now, based on CDC guidance, extended our pre-cruise testing and onboard mask requirements through the end of 2021"
Mr. clean why are you so quiet today should be the day you rejoice!?
A co-worker in Florida wife works in a hospital near Fort Meyer. She claims admission for covid is no greater now than 4 months ago. Very low. Where is this negative news coming from? Obviously some media sources have us thinking doom and gloom.
The best deal money can buy CCL will go up to $40 in a couple of months!
Keith where are you be?
"Looks like people are starting to realize that $24 is ridiculously cheap price for this stock. Even at 70% occupancy cruise lines are making money. And 100% occupancy is around the corner. And shorts haven't start to cover yet, 73 million shares shorted, 10% of the float. I wonder how many days it will take to go to 30 when they start covering... Probably only 5 or 10!"
Where is that wonderful analysis Keith?
"Hold onto your shares, the short squeeze is only starting, let the shorts feel the heat!"
doesnt matter what the pattern is today.. monday is a new game and the market will continue to go down and drag ccl with it
Still green Mr. clean!
"Funny how they announce more sailings but are cancelling tons of cruises. Enjoy.(12:30 p.m. EDT) -- The California port of Santa Barbara has announced it will cancel all cruise ship visits for this fall, affecting Pacific coastal and California coastal itineraries onboard Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line and Princess Cruises.This is the latest news on Carnival Cruise Line cancellations. These sailings are now CANCELLED:Conquest 10/8/21 – 12/10/21Sensation 10/21/21 – 12/31/21Liberty, Sunshine, Paradise and Ecstasy 11/1/21- 12/31/21Radiance 11/5/21 – 12/10/21"
"This sweet number has been priced in too much good expectation since spring! However, now summer has gone, it only left huge disappointment and even more brutal winter ahead!"
25 TODAY!!!
I bought the discounted shares today you will be buying back next week !
Why its large selling off?
"Sinve July 19th , several higher highs and higher lows , on verge of a break out. Afollow through tomorrow should force a squeeze."
"Hedge funds have increased their bearish bets against CCL lately, now CCL is a perfect candidate for a massive short squeeze. It will not go unnoticed at WSB. The hedgies will be ruined in a matter of days. Hold onto your shares, the show is coming any day now."
Today was the last time you saw Carnival trading below 23. The climb to 30 and beyond is set to continue.
Today is the day that Mr. clean said that the stock would close under $22.50! We shall see!
"shorts better cover, this may squeeze to 50 tomorrow"
"You got to love Longs trying to justify an impossible position. Facts are CCL said 2 conference calls ago 100% of ships would be in the water come end of 2021, Last conference call it went down to 75%. Chances are it will be below this number come year end.Europe is shut for most cruise lines, UK are only doing around UK staycations that will end very soon as summer is finished. Plus they are giving away cabins at the moment as no demand for cruising here.USA Hurricane season and with Alaska season ending soon. Plus all the troubles being reported by passengers at the moment, covid on board, costs, (so many negatives) You won't see much demand up to year end. So basically this year is dead to the cruise lines, Southern hemisphere pretty much closed also so all these ships would normally head there so no revenue here either.At the very best CCL will be profitable again end of 2022, but that is looking like a big IF. Losing money quarterly, no dividends, expect these levels to be the highs for the next 6-9 months.(P.S) Bought @ $8 sold @ $29.90. Will buy back in when the company reflects it's correct share price. Presently $16 is generous and fully expecting this to go lower as the year goes on. A company that if you bought it today with 2 billion loses per quarter. Being valued (enterprise value) more than when it was turning over 20 billion revenue in 2019 with 3 billion profit per year is very overvalued. It will be pumped and dumped but will settle somewhere between $10-$15 within the next 9 months. Enjoy."
"The mega squeeze is about to start, hold onto your shares. Shorts are about to go broke!"
Shorty ……I know you love me……
Jeff didn’t you say all indicators put into this going down to $17 or lower lol such a joke such a joke
Bring it anytime Mr. clean don’t talk if you can’t put up! I got nothing but time and money to show you! So it’s no big deal if I’ve got 5000 shares with an entry point of $19.50!
"RIP shorts and their hopes for 22, 21, and 20"
Back to $30 this week!
By the way Mr. clean look at the scoreboard again! You’ve been wrong all day!
It must be scary shorting a recovery stock. So much potential
Break out to 30 real soon
Another cruise canceled  They are going to house emergency workers from New Orleans...more money down the drain
It was a pleasure meeting many of you along with Mr. Miguez in Los Angeles yesterday.
"Hedge funds will start piling in looking ahead 12 months. By summer ‘22, cash should be flowing in and recovery in tact. $32 is a fair target. Beyond that depends on debt strategy."
CCL is worth holding 5 years at least.
All aboard!!
This is the next big short squeeze! Going to $25 by the end of the day
"You are literally watching stock squeeze everyday. SPCE, AMC, GME, CDIM, ANY, SKLZ, and hundreds more that have so much less value than #$%$s only a matter of time before we go back to $70. Think about all the times you ran after a squeeze, how about just buy and hold this and wait. This will be a great value and you know it, you're just scared to wait."
"This is your chance to get in. FDA Approval, whether you like it or not, will make these travel stocks soar back to pre pandemic levels!"
"chart went negative today, it could recover but for now looks bad. Stock is getting battered today. I hope we close in 23.50 range."
Jenny I know I’m not a smart person
"IM out in force, I take it CCL was green yesterday. If only he knew how to trade he might make easy money shorting these false hopes. I am and making a mint shorting everytime this goes up. Enjoy."
"""WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence fell in August to the lowest level since February amid rising concerns about the rapidly spreading delta variant of the coronavirus and worries about higher inflation."" Where is the good news for Carnival? There is none."
"Carnival Cruise Line Announces Next Round Of Restart Plans""We are very pleased with the progress of our restart which will grow to 15 ships sailing from seven U.S. homeports by mid-November,"" said Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. ""We are making slight adjustments to our timeline to take into account supply chain realities and ensure that our destination and shore excursion offerings can meet the strong demand we are seeing from our guests. Our teams, ship and shore, are prepared to continue delivering on our great guest experience and manage all health and safety protocols."""
It will open above 25 tomorrow. Blessed are the 24 call owners
$24 today ?
CCL looks like a good investment with the increasing pent up demand. Can anyone tell me how much longer this corporation can last with the debt load and low earnings?
Considering market was down today CCL held up good and is avove yesterday close and holdingGo CCL
Now that the worst is over and clear sign CCL getting better BUY BUY BUY
"Those who cruise are the ones with money. Those with money are established in their careers and generally older in age. So yeah, they are most definitely vaccinated. CCL will see good profitable days again."
my mother 76 years old got covid a couple weeks ago and she said it was no more than a common cold..only reason she got tested was because she is unvaccinated and has to test to get into see my father in memorycare. she said flu was worse than covid... let's cruise!!
"There's a gap between 22.02 & 22.24 formed on Aug 23, and apparently it's not gonna ever be closed. And stupid shorts are dreaming of 21 and lower prices. Bears are bound to lose a lot of money on this stock, lol."
This is going to pop soon - If you sold today you got shaken out.
This is great news they are buying back there share https://www.carnivalcorp.com/static-files/c12956f5-5967-405d-86e2-2aff6f2081f8
"Monday's playbook - Lots of volatility in Carnival's share price. CCL will open down, and then have a slight increase as some speculators see lower prices as a buying opportunity. Shares will trend downward for the day losing anywhere from 2% to 7% in value. Eventually, rating agencies will downgrade Carnival shares (possibly on Tuesday or Wednesday) which will bring prices into the teens."
Ccl you belong to me!
impressive come back today
People always talk about earnings and how it’s going to bring the stock down in 2 and a half weeks.......truth of the matter is is that ccl had only gotten better in the last quarter. How could it be worse we are actually cruising.
Weren’t we supposed to be buying puts yesterday?
One of the best deals out there right now CCL!
"Great news… from today in the UK, double vaxxed people no longer need to isolate if no symptoms. Another move back to normality. Source: Sky news."
Ccl was once a $60 stock....and once CCL able to control covid on it ships then it can go back to $60 in not time.Buy at any opportunity everyone can.
If they can fill college football stadiums and pro basketball arenas then they can fill a boat
"Breakout is imminent, buy as much is you can. This thing will not stop before it reaches 25"
"Conference calls, quarterly reports, charts, blah blah blah. At the end of the day sentiment moves the stock. Study the financials all ya want the market has a mind of its own. Yeeeehaw"
Tell them that blue oyster loves CCL!
Well I’m a believer now CCL is going up to $30! The accumulation Is real!
If you do not buy now you will CRY!
I see many new goats in my future! Now if I could only find a toothbrush and some deodorant I’d be good!
"SEATTLE, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Seabourn, the ultra-luxury ocean and expedition travel company, is appealing to adventurers and historians alike with the announcement of Seabourn Venture's new inaugural itineraries, Wild & Ancient British Isles Voyage and Scottish and Norse Legends Expedition, setting sail in April 2022.Seabourn VentureSeabourn VentureThe first of the line's two new purpose-built, ultra-luxury expedition vessels, Seabourn Venture is scheduled to depart for its inaugural voyage on April 10, 2022, exploring the United Kingdom in an unprecedented way with a 12-day Inaugural Wild & Ancient British Isles voyage from Greenwich (London), England, to Leith (Edinburgh).

These voyages are available for booking on August 19, 2021."
Keith - I’ve been waiting for 3 months for your $18 prediction to come true. I’m starting to think that maybe saying it over and over again on a yahoo board won’t actually make it come true. Who knows though.
"Covid ending is nowhere in the prices. I believe covid is ending at this recent downtrend in daily new cases. The reasons are because:1.) About 65% of world population works, most of which has been vaccinated (40-50% of world population has been vaccinated) and it is among the workforce where covid *would* spread. ""Vaccinated people are well protected against new variants."" which I really appreciate.2.) People who were infected with one strain rarely get re-infected with new variants, and the few who do have mild symptoms.Also, ""daily new cases"" charts show these waves. You might expect those waves to continue (I did) with every new variant. But what I did not account for was how every wave was during less vaccinated periods. You'll notice the ***DELTA WAVE*** of late August was actually less severe (with a peak of 746,485 daily new cases) than the late April wave (with a peak of 903,239 daily new cases). Why was April worse? Because only 7.4% of the world was vaccinated, and now it's 42%. Take a look at daily new deaths. April's wave peaked at 15,856 and August's peaked at 11,731, and all generally a smaller wave. So really appreciating that it's vaccinations (at 42%) gradually ending covid, consider the workforce hypothesis again: closer to 100% of prime would-be spreaders are vaccinated. In other words you see this 42% number and don't realize the potential surprise of how it's better than it looks. There is some malarkey about vaccine ineffectiveness which is completely contradicted by the data I just laid out."
I assumed to soon Am I seeing a break out (Hopefully) hit 24.49 just enough to have a new high.Every one buy some shares and this keeps going
TREMENDOUS BUYING OPPORTUNITY!!!!! Load up on CCL NOW!!!
"Big money at the very least wants the 23.5c in the money. 24c is possible this session, but I think the 25cs all expire worthless."
"CCL is only going higher, the vaccine and test requirements are being embraced. This is the next phase moving FORWARD, CCL longs know the BIG PICTURE of progression here. The Non-Vaxers won’t sail and that suits the Vaxers just fine and are willing to pay a little more for their safety. SHORTS don’t see this for some reason, dilution is only a small part of building back to massive profits in the long run. When I say 3, 4,5 TIMES YOUR INVESTMENT……..I not only mean it but will prove it! One more word…..BUY!"
"We're three weeks away from the earnings report. The June-August quarter will be ugly, which is expected. However the guidance for the next quarter and beyond will be better than Wall Street projects and it will move the stock higher. It's obvious that Delta impact on cruise lines was minimal. It's being mitigated by pent-up demand and lack of other options for travel."
"Here's the reason for the recent selloff in cruise stocks. However this is a sound advice from CDC and a good news, because bears where expecting a much harsher reaction from CDC, but it's a simple advice not to travel for people who would not travel anyways:Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday people at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, irrespective of their vaccination status. Older adults and people with medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from the disease and should take professional advise before cruise ship travel, the agency said."
1 month chart is looking great. Higher highs and higher lows
Only good news here is for shorts.
I had a carnival cruise booked for november 29 its cancelledThe rep said they have over 100 cruises cancelled . I think there in real trouble.
"The CDC warning vaccinated people not to take a cruise, won't make any difference. CCL's heading for restructuring anyway."
When else can you buy a company making a couple hundred million that is set to resume business in excess of $10B!?  buy these dips
Mr. clean sounds like you have a lot of people counting on you being right about your prediction about being under $22.50 today we shall see GLTA
"I’m here till next summer, so I can deal with days like this, but the manipulation and bipolar nature of this stock (sector) is exhausting."
"Funny, my account shows a weird number…….98.97% gain to date! Where are the shorts"
Most time having knowledge or insight about a particular activity can as well be a pleasing exercise. I can boldly say that forex and crypto trading is one of the profitable money exchange services that elevates investors and their financial status
Thanks CDC … dear god
Max must be the new Mr. clean SMH!
Look at the scoreboard Mr. clean! How are you doing? No response needed.....
December booking is starting to fill up quickly
Of the 27 people that tested positive for Covid they were all vaccinated and they were all asymptomatic! That’s good news!
"50% occupancy is enough for cruise lines to have POSITIVE cashflow. Just facts:""What occupancy does Royal Caribbean Group need on its ships to be at a break even point for cashflow?Somewhere between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the ship, according to Jason Liberty, executive vice president and CFO. “The ships are accretive to us around that 35% to 50% mark,” he said, on the company’s second quarter earnings call. “And obviously, the newer, larger ships are closer to 35%. And older, smaller ships are closer to that 50%.” Ramping up operations in the last few months, Liberty also noted the company is that after a few weeks of getting ships up and running, they get to occupancy levels “in which the ships are accretive to our overall cash position.”"""
Mr. clean when you’re in there you might find something 
"Just returned from Playa Del Carmen Mexico. We could see Cozumel pretty well everyday sitting on the beach. Noted several cruise ships coming and going everyday throughout the week, just to far away to see what companies. Also the tourist spot ""5th street"" was packed. Lots of masked and unmasked (50/50). Travel is on, people just enjoying being people."
Oceania Cruises Sets A New Single-day Booking RecordI assume this is negative news for the cruise industry too @Jeff?
Hey Mr. clean look at the scoreboard it’s green!
"Who cares about the short term movements if you are a shareholder? Options, I can understand, but why buy the short dated options. I’d be looking out at the earliest to the 1/22s. Pretty sure this can recapture 27-30 by then. Delta already on the wane. Can’t see there not being a rotation back into travel / leisure at some point as what happened late last year earlier this year. It’s inevitable."
"About 99.999% of fully vaccinated Americans have not had a deadly Covid-19 breakthrough case, CDC data showsThis is a great opportunity to buy for long term investment."
I have a feeling that I will be seeing many goats in my future for my goat farm!
I find it interesting but puzzling why the $24 area is becoming such strong resistance level.Also seeing the last 2 highs are slightly lower than the 8/25 high (lwr Highs) normally not a good sign ?? What is the thoughts of the group? Todays pop and give back of 50% thinking should trust chart and take some profit and play again next week ??
Customers go bye bye. Enjoy.Cruise news update! In today's show we look at CCL who has extended their vaccine and mask policy through the end of the year.
28$ next week
Come on Mr. clean be negative you need to bring this down! Do you realize how much your opinion matters and affects the stock price. Please where are you at come save us shorts! Lol
like it or don’t like it....... learn to love it because CCL is the best thing going baby!
It will soon business as usual worldwide.
"Crazy volatility. When the CEO was asked about the effect of Covid on the cruise industry, he very smartly said the following: ""A. I can’t talk between quarters, but just generally I would tell you that as we look ahead we don’t see major barriers out in the future to cruise."". So, he instinctually wants to keep share prices as high as possible before the next share dilution."
All these green days make me hard!
"More Red tape for cruise lines to encounter going forward. Enjoy.(CDC site Covid -19 updated Friday)Breaking cruise news. The CDC has released new guidance calling out people who should not cruise right now regardless of vaccine status. These included those who are older, those who are obese, and those with other comorbidities."
"Price dropped today because the CDC now recommends that passengers get a COVID test within two days of boarding a cruise ship, a shorter time frame than before. But actually it's a good news because now it's important to make cruising as safe as possible to get more elderly people on board."
Market looks 6 months ahead. Looks good to me for a bit of a pop here and over the next several trading days.8/26/2021 $23.65 1:00PM EDT
"CCL is flagging and has formed a triple top within its consolidation. This has now tested the bottom support channel 6 times and looks poised for a breakdown to the next level of support, around $21.50. Enjoy."
Buy now at $23..... It will be $50-70 in two or three years.
Mr. clean Will you be cleaning my house when you lose all your money today for money
"WHY you guys buying CCL at $$51 BILLION Valuation, near ZEROO Revenue..?? Net DEBT $32 BILLION+ $27 Billion mkt cap.. They issued new shares, will keep burning Cash next 3 years at least, keep adding debt..To be honest CCL Valuation has been diluted, balance sheet DEBT up to eyeballs..CCL deluding you, it's not strong like before, its opposite of prior to covid19.. But good luck to you all, I hope CCL SKYROCKET TO $100, and why not if AMC, GME can do it, why not CCL.. But I wouldn't count on investing like that"
Lovely week. Enjoy.
$40 end of October
"I just returned from my SECOND Carnival Cruise since the 3 July restart. They are sailing at 70% occupancy. They DO require 95% vaccinated and DO require a negative COVID test for 100% of passengers. Masks are required when entering the Dining room, using elevators and attending large gatherings. Thank you CCL for the free $200 On Board Credit for being a stock holder and I have TEN future cruises booked. There is demand, and thank goodness that the negative anti-vaxer's aren't part of the Carnival FUN! Cruising is back."
Why are the same people always posting on here? Seems like they have an angle.
cruising is going to be the core of all vacations. it's becoming more and more popular among families. just give it a little time until this crisis passes by.
"Norwegian cruise ships are docked at Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Portsmouth, Va. A federal judge on Sunday night, Aug. 8, 2021, granted Norwegian Cruise Line’s request to temporarily block a Florida law banning cruise companies from asking passengers for proof of coronavirus vaccination before they board a ship. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams granted the preliminary injunction in a lawsuit challenging the state’s “vaccine passport” ban, which was signed into law in May by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis"
Tech points to a break out now
"By the end of August, 275,000 people will be cruising globally. Last September there were only 26,000. Source: cruise industry news."
CCL will be in the 40$ by spring of 2022
Enjoy.CRUISE NEWS - LESS DEMAND FOR CRUISING.While more and more cruise ships at starting up every week. it seems demand for cruising has begun to fall sharply. At least for the rest of this year. That means there may be even more savings ahead as cruise lines try to fill the ships.
"IM4 hours agoThe mega squeeze is about to start, hold onto your shares. Shorts are about to go broke!It drops 53c since the post...Enjoy."
I bought 200 puts $24.5 expiring tomorrow. WE ARE GOING TO WAR PLAY <3
"Covid cases are way down in the U.S., money is flowing back into Carnival stock."
"This is undervalued, this might go back to 30$ really fast !!!"
I cannot wait to watch the stock go to $40 so I can buy my first of many 7-Eleven’s! I will then be able to have free Slurpee’s anytime I like!
Where is that iron death cross?
We are about to launch... 22.80 is a key level... next stop 23
Looks like we’re heading for a good day! Everyone knows this will be back to $30 by the end of the year no doubt!
30$ next week
It appears that we will be moving on up to the $24 mark next week! Normally October as a flat month for stocks but in this case with CCL I do see that this may outperform the rest of the market because the cruise line stocks have not recovered their losses and they will in the next coming months. It’s not about P&L’s it’s about sentiment and we all know after watching Gme amc and many other stocks that they can be game changers when you bet at the right time. I’ve placed my bet won’t you
90- 100% occupancy will be soon for all Cruise lines.. some are fully books.
My wife left me
"I was Pfizer vaccinated, both doses, and got the Rona. It was a typical lingering cold, that's all, definitely didn't live up to the hype and I've been a lot sicker. Not a single one of my family/friends caught it from me (all vaccinated). We need to stop worrying and start living again. Just get the vaccine and you're protected, and book that cruise!"
"Citi upgrades CCL to $34 price target, but Norwegian earnings disappoint and options today…"
If this reaches $24 today you can pretty much kiss away the BS that Mr. clean talks!
Seems CCL is holding up good considering dow dropping this AM.For CCL to recover from the drop shows strength to me Lets get to 30 and move up from there.The ship staying in New Orleans to provide housing for a short time was a good move IMO
"73 million shares shorted. Data shows that Hedge funds shorted big CCL in the end of July and August when the stock was trading around $21-22:Citadel shorted 2.3 million shares, Millennium Management shorted 2.3 million shares, JPMorgan Chase - 1.1 million shares. Back in November when big boys run for cover and bought back only 40 million shares stock price increased 100% in one month: from $12 to $24. And that was before Wallstreetbets. The story is going to repeat itself, but this time the price will double from $20 to $40. IF WSB participate, this is going to happen in a matter of days. Cruise line stocks are a very attractive short squeeze targets right now, because the short interest in GME, BBBY and other ""classical"" stocks has significantly decreased and right now is comparable to Carnival. Hold onto your shares, you'll double your money in no time."
It appears you were going to be wrong today Mr. clean! I see you have been playing other stocks and have been neglecting your comments lately on CCL which is very disturbing to me! I like a man who will stand up and stand behind his comments! Not a weasel
This will go up to $25 today!
I'm good with 1% green everyday!!!! 3.5x my money every year! This will go back to $60 easy!
Enjoy shorting folks! LOL
"If the reversal occurs, it’s gonna make a really strong chart."
Nice bear trap today. I bet we'll hit 24.50 tomorrow.
CCL doing fine!! Stay long and watch this stock again begin to climb higher.Looking at 30+ SOON! jg
I’ve got one thing to say I’m glad I am not Robert!
The U.K. said it will relax strict COVID-19 rules to help boost international travel.
This stock has lost so much money in the past 18 months I can't even begin to tell you what will happen when interest rates rise and feds taper. This will literally go BK
Need to close at the highs today to move to 25. imho
Closing under $22.50 on Friday like i’ve been saying. Options tell the story kids
"+XPLast week I wrote that ""a close below 21.89 would call for a test of the lows."" Well, Thursday closed at 21.66 and CCL did not take the death plunge. This is the third weekly rebound after three weekly swings down. The upside volume is still anemic but CCL seems to have a bid to it on the dips. Today I added to my modest long position at time 11:38 CDT and raised my GTC sell stop. The June 2/ June 8 double top which broke down on June 10 coincided with the 3rd quarter and new moons. I believe the rally in CCL will start 23 Aug after the full moon of Sunday 22 Aug. Upside to Mid/Late September. For all of you news junkies, don't be surprised if the CDC and /or CCL make some sort of major announcement over the weekend. Sill cautiously bullish with sell stop below.Peace."
"• Beginning September 13, 2021, all customers wishing to enter any Oahu restaurant, bar, gym, or other establishment on Oahu will need to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test. The 'Vaccine Pass' is part of the Safe Access Oahu program, which will remain in effect on Oahu for at least 60 days, until mid-November 2021."
So CCL debt went up 3X and their shares outstanding went up 50% which would mean a $50 share price two years ago is $25 today
"Dear everyone, go travel. Also enjoy those 2022 cruises which you have already booked massively."
"Have a good weekend. Enjoy.CRUISE NEWS - CANCELLED CRUISES AND EVEN MORE TESTING REQUIRED.Princess, carnival, and Cunard cancel cruises. British virgin Islands may require test to get off ship. Passengers on the carnival Magic delayed getting off ship in Amber Cove."
Where are you at Jeffy?
When full FDA vaccine approval comes next week - BOOM up she goes !
And Robert by the way I’m not selling until this thing hits $30
"CCL is a perfect target for wallstreetbets now, shorts are about to go bust. This stock could triple in value in a couple of days!"

"The interesting country to study is Israel. They had the highest rate of vaccined people ... and yet ... the new infected spiked to all times high.I have been watching CCL/RCL/NCLH ... and believe that NCLH is at risk at having to rise capital at a point in time.In the UK, they are thinking at implementing a firebreaker period later on ... the world opened a bit exageratel to save tourism industry and give fresh air to the population. I personnaly am not invested anymore in the cruise lines and expect a correction as figures of infections (delta) will be growing and CDC may tighten some rules or ... depending on how it goes and also how cruise operators will handle the sicks onboard. I sometimes play the shortcovering ... but in this situation ... 10% ... is not a lot and the stock could double (worst case for shorters) ...while leaving nice downside potential.

"Cruises in Europe are going at 100% occupancy and no tests are required for fully vaccinated passengers. In the U.S. they are switching to 100% occupancy already next month. Only Australian branch is not sailing yet (only 3 ships). Let's see how much profit Carnival will make in the 4th quarter (September, October & November). It's really possible for them to return to profitability that soon if they manage expenses well"
"All ships sailing by end of year, now they are admitting the lies. So not December but May next year. Enjoy.SEATTLE, Sept. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- By late spring 2022, Holland America Line will have a complete fleet back to cruising with the restart of operations for Noordam, Oosterdam and Westerdam. Noordam will restart with a March 14, 2022, cruise in Japan; Oosterdam will begin cruising May 1 in the Mediterranean, and Westerdam will return to service May 8 in Alaska."
"Robert, your spamming on here makes it obvious that youre short on this stock. A word of advice, nobody cares"
$38 End of September
Mr. clean looks like everything is green! You’re a dope Feen! Don’t mean to be mean mr clean. Just watch a green ccl and try to be serene while listening to a dope feen like you. Word to your mother! Green Green Baby!
"If you want to get an early peek at what direction the country is heading with COVID just look at the number of daily tests being done. Those numbers have peaked and falling already. The less tests, the less positive cases. You'll start seeing positive COVID cases drop a few days later since it takes 3-4 days for those results to update."
To the moon today
"Covid-19. vax only part of the solution. Need more therapeutics so we can treat it, be it on a plane, an office, a cruise ship, etc."
CCL making her happy too! I wish shorty would see the light….oh well I’ll toast to shorty on my next CCL cruise!
"Hey, 2019 ccl had 2b liquid with 9b debt. 2021 they have 9b liquid with 26b debt; soooo the net difference is 10b. Keep in mind, they can refi the debt with lower interest once near full capacity cruising is achieved. In 2020 they trimmed the fat by disposing less efficient ships. In conclusion, CCL compass is pointed in the right direction after dodging the covid storm. Everyone should book a cruise!"
Today I purchased mini goats for my goat farm! I am the largest goat Barron in all of the country that I live in. My peoples need CCL stock to go up!
I’m praying everyone stays away from this with winter coming and Covid continuing to mutate liberals will never stop crying about it and move on cruises will never recover fully
Buying right now the stock is going up $.30 in the next hour
"Even though it is still very early in the trading day and anything can happen later it sure looks like AS USUAL the paid basher / pumper, @Jeff may be wrong again for the umpteenth time.@Jeff with his prediction of 9/17 closing below 22.50. You may not have seen his post because he is a coward and deletes most of them. Or his famous watch for the dip to 16 comment.In addition, Who here does not know that:@Wolf of Wall Street @GSound, @Mr. Clean, @ Carn-Evil C.L., @Habib, @Keith, @Robert, @IM, @Ayden, @ Issay, @Allen, @CJ, @Gordo, @Christopher, and about 60 other usernames is the low life bipolar fake trader @Jeff."
Just keep buying at this bargain price.
This thing is going anywhere until COVID is behind us and CCL shows a good earnings
Mr. clean when you lose all your money come work on my goat farm!
"I'm long this via options but the pattern thus far has been green day, red day, green day, red day. By this logic tomorrow will end up being red. Very frustrating stock recently. The 22.5 put holders will wanna push this lower and the 25 call holders will wanna push this higher. I think the 25c holders have a good chance of getting smoked this week. Doubtful we can hit 25, unless there's a massive sudden push."
30k options expire next week @22.50. would think it finishes below that price next Friday. Enjoy.
Hey shorty….you’re losing a ton of money trying to short CCL!
"Rick at the Motley Fool today: ""Carnival's reputation is taking on water, and not just because a passenger died. Why was she left in Belize with her family having to finance her return back to the U.S. to receive better care that came too late?""Well Rick, even before the Pandemic cruise lines wouldn't assist passengers that became sick. EVERYONE should have a form of travel insurance, and in CCL's defense that passenger had the opportunity to purchase it from CCL directly prior to the cruise. It is sad that a passenger died, but in NO way is this CCL's fault."
How delish! Shorting from yesterday’s peak! LOL
So you're worried about covid on a cruise ship. How many cases are linked to the Mexico boarder crossings? The media doesn't even touch on the subject but they continue to think a cruise is going to bring the end of the world. Hmmmmm. Crazy world we live in.
How are those puts doing robert? You should be thanking us for trying to warn you. Best of luck!
With my earnings I plan on buying a 7-Eleven so I can sell Slurpee’s all day!
"Short squeeze is starting, all aboard! Longs are about to get rich. Let's take it to 70 in three days!"
"Today is the last chance to buy for sub-24 prices. Next week we'll move to 26 which would be a fair price for CCL for now, considering it's not fully back to business yet."
Rob lik my #$%$
Things are looking good for CCL! The volume is great and sentiment is high!
"CarnivalEven cruising fans are coming after Carnival. Last week kicked off with 50 passengers from a recent sailing filing a class action lawsuit against the world's largest cruise line operator for not doing a better job of protecting its passengers on a cruise that had a COVID-19 outbreak. It would go on to extend its vaccination requirement through the end of the year, a move that will help make its ships safe but will also alienate a chunk of its audience. The stock would then go on to tumble along with other tourist stocks following the U.S.'s problematic monthly jobs report. This recovery is clearly going to take a lot longer than bulls were expecting."
Close above 23 today. There's no reason whatsoever for this stock to trade lower that 30. This anomaly will be corrected very soon
I sold a put spread in CCL at the 25 22.50 strikes towards the end of June thinking that even if it did breach there would plenty of time for it to come back around to 25 by August expiration. This position has made me want to pull all of my hair out.
Nothing but a G thing baby! This is going to $25 by the end of the week Mr. clean!
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Bought 5 @$19.48 hoping to see $60 when cruise line sail again
It’s so easy to manipulate a couple of shares after hour. We just can’t stop institutions dumping CCL tmr once markets open! LOL
"73 million shares shorted. Very soon shorts will run for cover and take us to mid-30s. Their bet on Delta was wrong, it's almost under control and demand for cruises will soon go back to the reported couple of months ago 20% above 2019 peak level"
"If he remains in office, he may add more covid restrictions since he won't be in an election cycle. But the citizens in California are pretty sheep-minded when it comes to covid fears, they support mandates. Nor much will change if the governor remains in office, most of the cruising in America is happening in Florida where the economy is fully open. Any significant change will only happen if the recall is successful and Elder is made governor, at which point he might make an effort to lure cruising into my socialist state."
Fundamental say that this is going to break out! Enjoy I know I will to $30!
Buy all of the CCL you can!
"Charts turned bullish again, we're above 50 day sma & 20 day sma. Will be trading in the 24-25 range by the end of the week."
"Cramer is calling for more downside, for the market for the rest of the month."
Volume is up. I am happy with CCL this week. We just need Joe gone to bring back the economy and freedoms!
COVID cases are declining. $ 24 tomorrow
"I haven’t been here for a while. Great consolidation recently. Good to see that Robert is still claiming to buy puts every day. Love to see it. Just thought I’d check in. Robert - how are those puts doing that you bought at $19, $20, $22? Also, when are we going to $18? You and Jeff have been saying this for 6 months now. I guess your puts have Likely expired worthless by now. My advice is to stop handing out money to people who are selling puts at the lows."
"CDC had their say, nothing bad happened, cruising will continue as usual and shorts will have to start to cover on Monday"
Time to sell-definitely a dead cat bounce before inflation numbers tomorrow!
"We gonna close in the 23.50-24 range today, load up the CCL shares while they are still cheap!"
I Keep Buying. Been in CCL since $14. Bought another 5K shares at $23.10. Now at 35K shares.If you snooze you lose on this one.
CCL has broken through the $24 mark . 2nd time of late it went as high as $24.50 plus. This is one tough stock & saw very low 20s. This stock may see $25 plus. Any good news & who knows
"At the current rate of loss, they only have enough cash to last till March 2022 before before more dilution or borrowing more at even higher interest rate - that is if any bank would lend. Delta infection rate is still increasing and could last well into Spring next year. This is very dangerous. Can anyone give your bull thesis to invest in CCL that I am missing?"
buy this dip

"Europe is completely open for cruises which are allowed at 100% capacity. Costa Cruises (Carnival's Italian subsidiary) has 9 fully booked cruises in August, 19 cruises in September, 32 cruises in October, 40 cruises in November and 45 cruises in December. In Europe vaccination rate is close to 75% and there's no test requirements for fully vaccinated passengers and no limit on how many unvaccinated passengers can go on a cruise. Guess what? Carnival is going to make more money in Europe in the forth quarter than it did in 2019"
The CDC has announced on the roads recommendations for travelers not to use cruise lines because of the new variant of COVID-19 I am not a rocket scientist are a genius but I would think that that would affect the stock price we will see
"Frankly, CCL is heading down below 19 from now on! Institutions have been selling at such a sweet price. When retail traders recognize it. it’s already below 19. Then CCL is heading to 14 in October."
"CDC personnel must have been buying Put options prior to today's announcement: Fri, August 20, 2021, 2:57 PM·1 min read""(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday people at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, irrespective of their vaccination status.Older adults and people with medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from the disease and should take professional advise before cruise ship travel, the agency said.""I can just hear my doctor saying: ""Oh sure, your 75 years old, but go ahead with your cruise plans. Covid won't hurt you if you have been vaccinated"". Thanks, DocLooks like the bad news for the weekend has already leaked out. Put options heaven on Monday's opening share price. I need to remember to increase my limit sell prices before Monday morning. Please remind me!"
"Its clear some on here want the stock to do bad. sry to break your hearts, buts going to dbl within 6 months"
"CCL open on Monday at $24, stock reversal about to begin. Buy baby. . ."
Major correction 18 bottom
Buy as much CCL as you can put all of your best clients on it!
"Larry Elder might get elected in the California recall, if that happens he's removing all mandates and restrictions which could help the cruise industry there."
"For those asking “where are the bashers today?” Let me explain. The reason we are not seeing bashers today (as much as usual) is because the volume is high. The people paying these bashers are not going to pay them to post here when the volume / movement is out of the control of the market maker. This is why you don’t see them posting as much today, because they’re not getting paid to. They get paid to post when the volume is so low that the market makers can take advantage of bid ask spreads and manipulate the share price down to make better entry points. I tease Robert and Keith about how much money we all would’ve lost if we listened to them and about how much they have theoretically lost, but they haven’t. They haven’t lost because they’re actually long on the stock. They bash because their bosses tell them and pay them to. They’re not going to pay them to bash when the buyer volume (shares traded) is so high that they can’t manipulate the stock. Simple. Remember when we ran up to $32? The bashers vanished completely. Gone. It’s simple. It’s clockwork for these guys. Take advantage and capitalize of the fear of retail traders. I’d say smart, hats off to them, but they’re unethical. They lie and exaggerate to spread FUD which is a scummy thing to do.GLTA"
I guess shorts are beginning to realise that shorting CCL in the low 20s was a bad idea
Where are you at Robert and jeff?
"9% of the float sold short, 74 million shares vs 13% of the float for GME and 17% for BBBY. CCL could be the next short squeeze target. Would be fun to watch the stock at 40 and all the shorts burned to ashes."
2 things you can do to push the price higher ——- Buy CCL and book a cruise!
Sure has been in a range 22.00 to 23.50 latelyWith Dow down today dragging most stocks done CCL hit alsoI thought it would of gone above 22.50 today. Held up early but fell on the Dow going down
To the Shorty McFLY……it’s true… you will lose….A LOT OF MONEY!!!
Run to 25 tomorrow? Lot of open interest on the 25cs expiring.
"This stock will be at 40 next spring and will be over 50 by the end of the next year, after two-three profitable quarters. Don't miss your chance to buy a great, well-managed and undervalued company for a fraction of it's real price."
Looks like CCL might be going up from here.......
"Carnival beginning to cruise is not the good news. Now, is when problems begin to occur which takes the wind out of its sails."
"This stock if it closes this far and the green will open up on Monday at $24 just like that! Looks like the sleeping bear might be coming out to be a big old bull ready to be the next bull to run like amc and gme. The accumulation is here and solid with many quality bag holders, with a big push or rotation of trading this stock could easily have a quick run up to hit $30 before October 1st! Bankruptcy come on Jeff lol stop please that just shows that you’re in your moms basement jerking off! Lol."
"Take Note:-while Carnival's stock price is way down, its enterprise value is actually comparable to what it was before the pandemic. In other words, the market is saying Carnival's business is worth roughly the same right now as it was back in 2019 when times were good for cruise companies. I disagree with the market on this one, and it's why I'm calling Carnival stock overhyped.Looking forward to a best-case scenario, I don't see any reason Carnival's business should be better than in 2019 anytime soon. After all, it's not like the cruise ship industry was growing by an impressive rate before the pandemic. That said, it was steady and profitable. And its profitability made Carnival a decent investment back then because management was buying back shares and paying a juicy high-yield dividend.In 2019, Carnival generated operating income of almost $3.3 billion. And it ended that year with just under $10 billion in long-term debt, which was manageable. As of the most recent quarter, however, Carnival had almost $26 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Simply put, even if Carnival got back to full strength today and was generating substantial cash flow, it would take years before it could repair its balance sheet and return to being the company it once was. Remember: Lenders always take priority over shareholders. Therefore, there probably won't be any share repurchases or dividends for some time. This is the problem that I see for Carnival investors today. I'm not suggesting the company is doomed. But it's going to be a long road to even justify its current enterprise value. And generating market-beating returns on top of this seems like too big a challenge to overcome."
I heard about CCL the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"vaccine mandates coming for shopping malls, airlines, ground transportation including Uber and Lyft, cruises, all companies and school. CCL and NCHL will fly! All day Long!!!!"
Oct1 24 strike calls have low implied volatility now... get them now before they surge as earnings approach.. tech points to a $25 price target in the coming days...
What will earnings look like next month? What are the options indicating?
Do you know are used to think that the stock was going to go down over the last couple of days. But now as I look at the chart and I see that it?s gone sideways almost a month up and down up and down every day and I look at the trend I do believe this might hit $25 before it hits $22.50! So that?s good for me if it goes to $25! But Mr. clean says it?s going down to sub $22.50 today! And since he is the stock God and genius I think I will listen to him! Not! Have a good day Mr. clean clean my #$%$
Mr. clean come out and play wherever you are lol! All those guarantees last week with all that bull coming out of your mouth! You better be right today son! Because if you’re not I’ll be the one who reminds you every day of your life because I got nothing but money and nothing to do but I don’t like you! So you better be right for your sake if not you might as well just plan on changing your name and moving to a different wall! I hear Stocktwits might suit you better Mr. clean!
This news will finally drive the shorts away hopefully. And better yet give some chance to buy somemore travel stocks.
who listens to the CDC anymore?
"Hold tightly onto your shares, we'll be over 30 in no time!"
Closing over $24 today.
Going up today! GLTA
I just want to say I was happy to make a donation to CCL Robert!
gavin newsom won...... california is doomed and carnival as well...
As usual folks the negative Nelly’s are nowhere to be found I do believe the stock might finish above $24 today!
"Well, well, well. Carnival just cancelled a bunch of 2021 Princess cruises departing from various ports including California and Florida. Of course, affected passengers have not yet notified, and Carnival released the news at 1 pm. Pacific time just as the markets closed. More ships sitting empty until 2022. Carnival vs. Covid. Covid is winning."
Someone on this board may want to check the Los Angeles news today.
Just went through the comments and had a good laugh at shorts who say that Carnival will go bankrupt because vaccinated people will not want go cruising anymore because of fear of getting asymptomatic Covid or because of testing requirements for passengers. Nice try!
Back to 24 by Friday's close. Covid-19 resurgence will not affect significantly the cruising business. The cruises will continue no matter how many new cases per day are reported in the US and Carnival will not have any trouble to fully load their ships with passengers because of pent-up demand and because there are limited options for travel right now. Many countries are either closed or half-closed. Let's face it: cruising is the safest and the most troublesome way to travel right now. Carnival will be profitable already in the next quarter and the stock price will reflect that
We're just 2 days away from 25. Shorts are completely clueless shorting a stock in a clear uptrend
"Huge losses and extremely significant debt at very high interest rates, COVID surging, money runs out around March...No need to short this, it goes to hell on pure fundamentals IMO..."
You can blame Joe for the fall of this stock. Stock was above 40 under the last president
Where are you Keith where are you Robert? No response needed we know! Lol
"Extremely oversold, another great buying opportunity. We'll be back over 24 next week and will hit 25 this month. The stock is clearly in an uptrend since it hit 19.19 on July 19th. I've loaded up at 19.83 and 21.33, probably will add more next week."
"This is not what we were waiting for in the summer. We were really disappointed. All this is because of the Delta, the inflation, the intransigence of the Americans and their failure to take the vaccine. They spoiled everything because of their insistence on not getting vaccinated."
Today could be the real reversal day … deep red start after crazy volatility day yesterday … let’s turn this real green by 10am
Keith used to be a Long you used to brag about how the stock was going to go to $40 for months ago? What happened to you? We all know you like the stocking want to earn it you just want to own a cheap. So another words you do like the idea of the the stock just not at this price correct? Doesn’t that mean that you do believe it’s eventually going to go up before two years from now? Why would you be on here if you didn’t plan on this going up in the next 3 to 4 months? It’s so obvious!
People are willing to pay the extra money for rapid testing at(or near the embarkation area). Proof of neg test is not enough.
Hey guys! It looks like something is happening with the stock. Mr clean was very wrong
"Charts have turned bullish, now the real buying will start. Shorts are fried"
Josh - You can thank me later for convincing you to sell your shares. Where is Princess Cays?
