"I’m riding this stock out until next summer. Some might critique this decision, but it allows me to ignore days like this and all the current manipulation in this sector. I truly believe all travel and hospitality stocks will be in a much better position by June next year."
$22.50 is the bottom! There’s a lot of resistance!
I live in puerto Vallarta next to the marina. Today I looked out my window and we had 3 cruise ships here. That’s the first time I seen that before covid started. The ships are going to be full with waiting lists.
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Why is this red if the company is saying 2022 bookings are way up? Is it because new outbreaks are occurring in Europe?
Fantastic deals on cruises right now with 'lots' of availability. No problem hopping on at the last minute. What a deal with a 70% cap. You might have a blast but the shareholders will be left holding their bags.
Don’t miss the boat!
It should move up today on the news restructuring debt is a very good idea.
"Cruises still like 60% of capacity - Can't make money doing that. Why are cruises at 60% when hotels at 100%? Because there is a fear that when 100% it becomes so crowded that outbreaks can occur. Tell me what other reason why not at 100% now? We will see how smoothly sailings go if and when 90%+ . In the meantime, CCL going to burn a ton of money until at least spring of 2022 - assuming by Q2 ships are close to full capacity."
Oh ice you’re so wrong!
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
Will there ever be a end to the selling in this flea bitten dog ?
"Cruises are gonna miss a significant component of cruisers - Canadians. While Canadians can now travel to the U.S. they need a PCR test to return home. Imagine taking a cruise and then one member gets infected and then what do you do? You are not allowed to fly home. So you need to stay in the U.S. But where? How many hotels will allow you to check-in when asked if you are sick? If I am wrong and it is not a disaster situation then someone can refute me on what a Canadian family does once a member gets a infected? Canadians make up around 10% of cruisers. And most unvaccinated Americans stillwon't be going on cruises due to restrictions on their movement, especially ports of call in many places in the Caribbean. Cruise lines simply have a much smaller current TAM. Now that everyone relauunching ships I expect prices and/or load factors will fall. The numbers been good only because of lower availability capacity and pent-up demand that is a blip. Just look at demand for resturants coming off the boil where many people ate out a lot after being cooped-up. sure restaurants still doing well, but much lower than the first few months after reopening because much of the pent-up demand has been satiated. Same will happen to cruises in 2022 especially if almost 40% of American's remain unvaccinated and if Canada continues to require a PCR test to come home."
shorts are so happy they pushed the stock down 3% by shorting 51mil+ shares.. hope ya know that's 51mil+ new shares for investers and y'all will have to cover sometime
"Want an 8% return? As you may or may not know, Carnival is a dual listed security, Carnival Corp and Carnival PLC. It's the same business entity but different legal entity. Shareholders receive the same voting rights and dividend. Both are listed on the NYSE. As of today, CUK currently operates at an 8% discount to CCL, but historically this has not always be the case. There was typically pricing parity between these 2 securities prior to 2019. Since then, CUK has seen a discount of up to 35% over CCL in 2020 and has now moderated to roughly 8%. Carnival took notice of this arbitrage opportunity and did a stock swap. Basically sold CCL and bought CUK to close the gap. When it will achieve pricing parity again is anyone's guess. This is simply an idea that can add to your rate of return for those who like Carnival."
"time to load up, shorts will be covering."
I do believe we are slowly inching our way back up from the major dip yesterday!
"Morning buyers of cruise stocks will prove to have been ""bag-holders"" by the end of the day. Cramer cherry picked comments like ""profitable in 2022 (which is a goal) vs. the clear negatives like RCL saying Q1/2022 bookings have been below normal and remainder of 2022 looks in-line with normal, which is WEAK because not all capacity up and running yet. If there was this huge pent-up demand that the Bulls want to make then as ships come available for bookings they should be largely sold out quickly - Obviously that has ""factually"" not been the case. You can thank Cramer again by the end of the day."
Wishing all of you a wonderful weekend.
Entry point does not get any better than this!
COVID is no match for our vaccines. It will run out of people to infect soon. Ccl will recover and thrive again.
Well low 20s just seems like a bargain this will not go bankrupt worst case 2 cruise lines will merge together or get bailed out by the government they employ so many people.
"Awesome dip yesterday, just bought in. Remember, buy when everyone says sell, and sell when everyone says buy :) Nobody cares about your investment except yourself"
Good news Carnival (CCL) upgraded by Berenberg from Sell to Hold
"I’m down $600, should I sell or hold?"
Blue light special on CCL huge profits next year buy add and hold and this will turn to gold.
"90% of Carnival US based ships will be sailing by February. More families will be on-board once the vaccine for children is introduced shortly. ""Carnival Cruise Line announced plans for more ship restarts for January and February, as it works towards the return of its full fleet sailing from U.S. homeports in the spring of 2022, according to a press release.With 17 ships scheduled to be operating by year-end, Carnival Sunshine will restart from Charleston on Jan. 13 and Carnival Liberty from Port Canaveral on Feb. 11.With today's announcement, Carnival's U.S.-based operations will cover the following homeports and ships by February, and represents 90 percent of Carnival's U.S.-based capacity:• Galveston: Carnival Breeze, Carnival Dream and Carnival Vista• Miami: Carnival Freedom, Carnival Horizon, Carnival Sunrise and Carnival Conquest• Port Canaveral: Mardi Gras, Carnival Elation, Carnival Magic and Carnival Liberty (effective Feb. 11)• New Orleans: Carnival Glory and Carnival Valor• Long Beach: Carnival Panorama, Carnival Radiance and Carnival Miracle• Baltimore: Carnival Legend• Tampa: Carnival Pride• Charleston: Carnival Sunshine (effective Jan. 13)"""
get ready....
"Ice, Robert, Robin, you’re really gonna act like you guys are brilliant when the stock is only down .18% give me a break talk to me at the end of the day!Ice why don’t you respond to your mistake about HTZ? Are you embarrassed?"
Hopefully it will not go below 18.70.
"Even if takes 5 years which probably will take much less for CCL to double from here, still 20% annualized gain and I guess there will be some dividends once they get to their full capacity."
Radio silence from ice because he’s frantically doing research and realizing oh I was wrong about HTZ lol. No response needed expected or wanted Robert
Ccl is in major trouble for citi to down grade by that much means restructuring will happen very soon with possible bankruptcy in 2022
"Bought the dip, love when people sell on fear"
Good news!Ccl replaces $2.3 billion old high interest debt with new low interest one. We should be happy
My guess is pricing is going down with all ships relaunched by the industry. Easier to brag about higher prices when availability was limited.
"Packed places, daily new covid cases going down, vaccinations going up, sell. Zero cruise bankruptcies coming, sell. All that's coming is full fleet, full capacities, and positive cash flow. sell.With all the debt, I don't see why big banks are giving cruise stocks higher ratings than current prices. I mean what do banks know about debt generally?"
All this so said positive news not lifting this stock..........interesting.
"this is like a bad one night stand, teases you then leaves."
Can’t make money when the ships are half full and fuel going up
Ice why don’t you do your homework you’re definitely wrong about HTZ
Whether you like it or don’t like it learn to live with it this thing ain’t going down to $20!
We’re hitting massive resistance folks….this is the TIME TO BUY !!!!! There will not be a better time to double and triple your money in 12 months! CCL is going one way…..and that IS UP UP UP!!!
i think its waiting for me to buy more shares so it can dip lower again. i'll play this game cause its eventually going back up.
"Think Ill start a position here. If it drops, oh well I'll buy more."
There are several types of restructuring for corporations. So which ones best for CCL ? More explicative.....which one will be necessary ?
23$ today
I bought in at $12 and I am in it for the long haul. Statistics are not showing the bookings for 2022. It is the best at what it does. They have met or exceeded CDC compliance. Hold Hold Hold
Go look at cruiselawnews website as they detail numerous infections onboard cruises that are not reported in mainstream media or easily found by simply Googling covid+case+cruises. There is a reason cruiseline companies are cautious to approach 100% capacity as the normal huge crowding can be super spreader events.
What a surprise. Red again. More to come !!!!!!
Tesla should acquire CCL
"Obviously nobody on this board could ever touch or manipulate this stock, but to think that something just keeps going down and down and down to zero is ridiculous. Shows a lack of intelligence. Why don’t you say something like after it goes down to $20 it will rebound up to $24. That at least sounds intelligent. Some of you guys are unbelievable the way you come on here daily. I short some, I go long on some change and roll with the punches but I never Come on here and bash! If you’re a day trader you buy 5000 shares at 21.97 and you sell at 22.20 5-10 times a day you’re going to do just fine, close your position out at the end of the day and you guard your losses! Some of you people that come on here and bash really sound like 13-year-olds. It’s actually pretty amusing! Lol"
My friend had just came back from ccl cruise out from Galveston port.They are fully book.
"50’s by year end, and 70’s to follow in 2022! It’s going to be a GREAT YEAR FOR CCL!!! Buy now or be sorry!!!"
This might dip to $21.50 but I feel it will sharply rebound to $23 immediately within a week! Then I could see this going back up to $26-$27 in November easily. So I’m just gonna sit right here and just wait it out. I’ll get plenty of money if I’m patient!
"UK has new variant AY.4.2 that is an offshoot of Delta. U.K now has the 2nd most daily cases (U.S. #1), but UK highest on per capita basis. UK cases surging now. What if this new variant is more severe - i.e., better at infecting vaccinated people? U.S. plans to allow Europeans to travel in on Nov 8. If U.K. cases go much higher and their hospitals get overwhelmed could U.S. reverse that policy - if only for U.K? Granted I am saying ""if"", but I am far from illogical fearmongering. What does that do to travel habits again? Cruise stocks still burning tons of cash to get boats back sailing - and at reduced capacity - and when oil prices surging. They can't tolerate a major change in travelers not wanting to cruise of new variant breaks-out. This time CCL and others loaded with debt. CCL EV back to 2019 which is nuts - I think risk-reward is terrible."
"For longs who don?t #$%$ easily?..I?m looking at my CCL investment and I?m seeing 5X profits for next year. Seriously as covid lessens (which it will) and MORE people get vaccinated not LESS, CCL is going to go through the roof ! I?m thinking my profits on this will pay for my 2-3 annual cruises for the next 20 YEARS!!!! Wow did I make a great investment, as did my fellow LONGS!!! Bon-Voyage shorty!!! ?"
Well Robert ice Robin look we’re green again! Just like that
"I just don't understand why CCL is not asking Grandpa Joe to add a bailout into the infrastructure bill? Everything else is in there. I know they are not incorporated in the USA but plenty of non- Americans are receiving our money. We are on a roll, let's just give it all away. Geez."
Booking prices wil be heading down now that all cruise operators brining back capacity. 1/3 of Americans still unvaccinated. And way fewer kids are getting booked on cruises. Onboard spent/person will also go down - the reason up was most initial cruisers were middle-aged/younger adults that drink. If and when seniors/kids become a bigger percentage of cruisers onboard/person will go down.
"CCL has gained 0.59% In Premarket Trading. To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
"I just got off of the Carnival Elation cruise yesterday. Apparently it was the first cruise out since covid. Here's what I know.. they are sailing at 65% capacity. our ship maybe had 40%. It felt pretty empty. But it was clean!! (and I own a cleaning company) The workers cleaned constantly. There was one other carnival ship out and one Disney ship. On the beach excursion in the bahamas, the resort was approximately 75% full. Many of the shops were permanently shut down because they couldn't afford the rent during covid. Aside from having to wear a mask quite a bit, it felt near back to normal. It was quite enjoyable!"
"""Cruise ships will return to San Francisco with a record 127 port calls expected in 2022"" per CBS. People love taking cruises."
"Carnival is about to teach their shareholders a very expensive lesson. You cannot lose hundreds of dollars each second (ask Josh for the calculations) while expecting to have your investment grow over the next few years. Carnival is running out of every bit of potentially good news (first ship to sail from San Francisco since the Gold Rush). Carnival will begin their dilution of shares at the tune of 100+ million dollars very soon. Carnival could have brought in 40 million more dollars if they had started the dilution a few days ago, and management is kicking themselves for not having started earlier."
Price target increased to $41. Outperform. Credit Suisse. Ben Chaiken who was on earnings call.
"The reason CCL is down in the premarket:Citi analyst James Ainley downgraded Carnival to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $24.50, down from $34. While he continues to believe in a recovery for the cruise industry, Ainley's comparative analysis of the pricing environment, ship pipeline, earnings quality, returns and valuation suggests that Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) will deliver more attractive returns to shareholders relative to Carnival. Carnival has delivered slower revenue and earnings growth over the last 10 years and its decision to exit older, less efficient vessels and smaller pipeline will limit its revenue recovery versus Norwegian, contends the analyst."
"Once Merck’s pill is approved by the FDA. CCL will shoot immediately to the $32 level, Could be early November,Pfizer is working on a pill too,COVID Is going to be over soon, those pills are going to be approved, there is no other choice,Kids 5-12 years old will be vaccinated starting next week,that will be great for family cruising,CCL has no problem getting capital, banks really trust this business model."
When is this crash going to happen boys? I can’t wait to buy some more. I already have 2000 shares at $21.40... can’t wait to buy another 5000 when this thing tanks but it doesn’t seem like it wants to so why do you guys keep predicting dumb stuff? Time in the market is hard enough! I’d like to at least get some wise advice besides Don’t invest in ccl when it is 1/3 of its high 2 years ago!
I said $$21.50 is the bottom and I’m sticking with that!
"Texas bans vaccine mandates for private businesses. Should this not impact CCL's vaccine mandate for its embarkation cruises in Texas? Of course, I am biased as negative on the stock price of CCL, but notwithstanding it is legitimate question. I am not even sure how CCL manages the mandate that disallows asking to vaccination status for guest in Texas."
Time to BUY AND HOLD!CCL is setting up a huge gain! STACK YOUR INVESTMENT NOW!!!
dont worry people will buy more carnival shares guaranteed. debt and dilution doesnt mean anything anymore
Holding
Ice I can’t help but see some of your post and you clearly didn’t do your homework when you were talking to Bill yes HTZ did file bankruptcy but they didn’t go through with it do your homework yes they were delisted yes they changed their symbol but all stockholders were made whole! Don’t speak if you don’t know what you’re talking about it’s better to say nothing and look smart then open your mouth and remove all doubt!
"The cruise ship operator is looking to syndicate a secured loan maturing in 2028 to replace a chunk of the 11.5% notes that it issued in April 2020 to boost liquidity while Covid-19 halted travel, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
This is a can’t miss! Picking up 5000 shares right now! FOMO
Cruises are returning … people can’t wait to get themselves on board! Keeping $CCL in portfolio makes allSense.
"Yeah so…Princess is sailing as we speak! India. Southampton, Vigo Spain, Panama Canal, Puerto Vallarta, CABO, Princess Cays…..say it with me …..MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!!!!!"
"Whoever want to invest go for it . Don’t listen to the losers who saying company is bad . They are just haters with no clue What is going on in real world. 2020 is the worst pandemic world ever seen at least for last 100 years . Carnival is one of the biggest cruise company’s in the world they survived over pandemic , they handle situation that no one was expecting to see ever . They got twice more beautiful ship then Norwegian . People are keep working , eating , traveling and enjoying their life’s. It’s not apocalypses . They 100% will recover. Like all other big corporations and industries that worldwide leaders . Imagine life without cars , boats and plains what we gonna do , ride a horse to get somewhere or maybe take a bicycle trip to Hawaii ??! The bears are just clowns "
I heard about CCL the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Many reasons to be excited!5-11 year old vaccinations in early NovMerck covid pill 90% of US based cruises will be sailing by Feb, full fleet by summerCDC issuing ""guidance only"" starting in JanAustralia cruses start in FebAnalysists forecast a positive EPS in 2022On average, analysts forecast that CCL's EPS will be $0.18 for 2022, with the lowest EPS forecast at $-1.04, and the highest EPS forecast at $0.74. In 2023, CCL's EPS is forecast to hit $2.05 (min: $1.51, max: $2.64)."
Black Friday's sales are coming early for Carnival's shares. Amazon will be envious.
"Since you never respond to this question @Jeff, @Robert @Kevin @Bill @Issay @Ice Eh (All the same person) I see you now moved further out your guarantee of CCL issuing more shares by February. Maybe they will or maybe they won't. You are usually 99.7% wrong anyway.I will ask once again, when are they going to announce filing for BK? I want to add a lot more shares to my portfolio but don't want to until you tell me when BK is guaranteed like you have lied about for 18 months.No response expected, again you tool. By the way are we still going to drop to $22.00 by Friday too?ENJOY!"
CCL will go up when vaccines are approved for children. My opinion
Easy money this is going to $28 by the end of November
Now we're on the way back to 27. Load up while it's still cheap!
"Trader ? Why did CCL drop on great financial news this AM at the open. Does not make sense? Market is up on govt budget extension , news is good for more ships coming on line Virus numbers are dropping Every thing is good What is missing ???Please no BS answers Tired of reading the BS on this board"
all aboard
This will rebound next week to $25 no sweat!
"This a couple of days old but CDC keeping most restrictions on until Jan 22, 2022. Data on virus cases not good enough to life restrictions."
I need to have this go up or I’m going to lose my goat farm!
Longs will be greatly rewarded….patience my little grasshopper. CCL will be huge green translating to very large bank account for you. COVID-19 deaths and cases heading down FAST….this is perfect setup for LARGE and I mean LARGE GAINS for longs. Buy NOW before it returns to 70’s!
"Carnival's marketing department is feverously working on the next rabbit they will pull out of the hat. For Princess, maybe more discounts on Winter travel for Carnival's most favorite passengers (Public School teachers). We'll certainly see another publicity stunt soon."
"Carnival bought 234,000 shares yesterday in their stock swap program"
"Oil prices hit another post 2014 high. Bad for cruiselines, but more so for CCL as ""I do not think"" they hedge their oil (could not find any oil hedges in 10K). RCL I know hedges some."
"First info from our cruise yjis Saturday is that you can still book to get on it. So even with reduced capacity and sailing to the Mediterranean, they cant fill the ships. Enjoy."
8 more cents and it’s red. Unbelievable!!!!!!!
US border will be open to all travelers coming November for Fully Vaccinated with PCR test.But US do required for Un-vaccinated travelers to get PCR test for proof of not infected with covid.

Expected move Citigroup Downgrade CCL FROM Buy to Neutral
Added another 500 today. Hoping this stock isn’t dead for the next 2-3 years
If nobody sells this would be the best stock ever.
"Listen, the shorty McFLY is letting some big ones go because they really thought CCL would be at $17 or lower. The fact is CCL bookings are through the roof and recovery is eminent in the months ahead. BUY AS MUCH CCL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE $70 will show its face in 2022!!!!!!!"
CCL. Hold your positions!! The shorties are trying to make you sell. don't fall for it.Cruising is back and will continue to increase in 2021 and 2022 +++. $$$$$.jg
23$ close
Shorts are desperately posting nonsesne non-stop and I understand why: very soon cruise companies will ditch all the capacity restrictions and will start earning big money again. Carnival stock will jump to a new 52-week high in a matter of days.
$25 by next week!
New CCL sleep POD cabins!Sleeping on a bed of CASH! Thank you CCL!!!Reserved only for LONGS!

"One would think the 'great news' of the CDC lifting restrictions in January, would give this stock a lift.So why the stagnancy ? Any ideas?"
Don’t think that other stock will perform better and CCL will do worse if food and fuel go up!!!
RCL admitted that booking on suites had been particularly strong - but given bookings for 2022 are only normal that means bookings for smaller cabins (majority of guests) is weaker. I can understand when ships are below 100% capacity and many wealthier people dying to travel and suites safer as more space I can understand why those bookings stronger - but that pent-up demand will dissipate - I say comments on bookings towards end of the year will be weaker with lower prices on new bookings once we pass the short lived pent-up demand and more capacity becomes for sale.
"Hi, Our steel guy needs you help, ( positive posts), your dream already happen to CLF (EPS $6.5), X (EPS $14.5), but our stock price is at same level with CCL, really frustration, can you help?"
Covid cases on ships much more prevalent than can be found on mainstream newshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnnF_0GkGrwhttps://www.cruiselawnews.com/
So where’s the next bottom?
"Just re-fared Princess 14 - day Mediterranean May 2022 cruise originally booked in Aug. for $2600 to today's price of $2000. CCL's profit margin continues to decline due to slow bookings. Just waiting for Princess to cancel this cruise as they did for my Feb. 2022 cruise in South America. See how Princess cancelled July 2022 cruises:Due to a full ship charter on Regal Princess on July 30, 2022, we will be cancelling the following cruises:• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 16, 2022 • Mediterranean with Greece Isles, France & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles & Turkey 7-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles, Italy & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 30, 2022Full ship charter is unreal most likely."
Good riddance hedge funds. I’m buying more. Also loading up on a hot EV play: ZEV
Buy now?
Merck is applying for emergency approval of COVID pills. So there will be no more outbreaks on cruises.
Over back to green Robert I know you’re so concerned!
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than CCL
Well lookee there Robert we are green now how you like them apples? No response needed...................
I think this bumps along 21-24 for a month or two and then hits 30 in spring.
is CCL a good buy ?
Should be atleast 30 way oversold adding to a long position 35 to 40 all day long in the longterm.
"Cramer says if oil keeps going up the market is in trouble. Nothing more in trouble than cruises - even more than airlines. Yes, fuel is a far bigger expense for airlines, but if people want to go on vacation they will still fly. But high oil prices makes cruises at a margin disadvantage to land-based hotels/resorts. So cruiselines either need to raise prices further - which makes the marginal traveller choose land-based or they accept even lower margins. and as ships still not at 100% the fuel cost per passenger is really high now. CCL trying to ""hand on for deal life"" and not issue more equity despite their debt now at a very high level. Bad risk management. If that Delta+ variant now ravaging the U.K. turns out to evade vaccines what travel activity take a dive again and cruises the first for governments to put on restrictions."
"Getting ready to load the boat. Easy money here. Will continue to add if it pulls back to it’s 100 day moving average (which would be a total gift lift to long term share holders). At some point in a few months, good news on covid will emerge and this thing will rocket back towards 30."
"Exactly what's holding this stock up ? Reduced capacity, increased fuel and food pricing, labour costs not going down, vaccination restrictions, continuing virus with variants, ports turning away cruisers. All of this with a whopping debt ! Who in their right mind would take a position here?"
Great times ahead!
