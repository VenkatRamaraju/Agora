"Who cares about the short term movements if you are a shareholder? Options, I can understand, but why buy the short dated options. I’d be looking out at the earliest to the 1/22s. Pretty sure this can recapture 27-30 by then. Delta already on the wane. Can’t see there not being a rotation back into travel / leisure at some point as what happened late last year earlier this year. It’s inevitable."
"Good to be collecting steadily on every dip, world loves cruises and nothing will change that."
"Covid cure in a Pill, thank you Merck. Time to cover your short!"
Merck is applying for emergency approval of COVID pills. So there will be no more outbreaks on cruises.
Just got 1700 shares. whose riding this train!!!
As usual folks the negative Nelly’s are nowhere to be found I do believe the stock might finish above $24 today!
All charts indicate major correction
"CCL should be more than prepandemic....with lesser interest rates, newer ships that are fuel efficient and have higher margins, improved capacity and reduction of low margin ships that they sold during pandemic. They are leaner and more fuel efficient.Not to forget the stake taken by Oil prince with reduced fuel costs."
"OK, here we go, That report was just horrible, Refused to give $/share loss is very worrying. Revenue was lower than last quarter meaning that even if ships are sailing they aren't making hardly anything on these. Expenses going forward will be higher, All ships sailing again has been pushed out till 2nd half 2022 (was supposed to be end of year as per last quarter), see what you want to see in it, but that was an horrendous quarter and this will go lower once reality sets in. Pump and dump in action and again the little people buying here will be the bag holders. Again this stock price doesn't in anyway reflect the situation. Being valued as a company making billions of revenue a year and in reality losing 2 billion. Enjoy your inflated share price whilst you can. Even more bearish than I was Friday morning. Enjoy"
yep another 20 just bought! Buy and Hold this! This will see ATH within a year!
Today I purchased mini goats for my goat farm! I am the largest goat Barron in all of the country that I live in. My peoples need CCL stock to go up!
It appears that we will be moving on up to the $24 mark next week! Normally October as a flat month for stocks but in this case with CCL I do see that this may outperform the rest of the market because the cruise line stocks have not recovered their losses and they will in the next coming months. It’s not about P&L’s it’s about sentiment and we all know after watching Gme amc and many other stocks that they can be game changers when you bet at the right time. I’ve placed my bet won’t you
Mr. clean why are you so quiet today should be the day you rejoice!?
"My personal experience on an 8 day Carnival cruise that just ended: staff executing mask wearing literally 100% everywhere always over nose and mouth and most wearing kn95, some were double masking. Go out in public and where else do you see hundreds of employees with this type of percentage? Guests mask wearing was on par with what you see in the general public (not great maybe 50-60%?) we were reminded numerous times daily but I didn't see staff single out anyone to comply. Cruise was fun and on par with precovid cruise enjoyment. Food and staff was top notch, perhaps slightly more upselling taking place than I remember before (encouragement to order from the bar, excursions, shops, photography) but nothing too pushy. Staff has 'watches' for contract tracing to minimize disruptions should covid spread among them. I really don't see any shortfalls for covid to enter aside from excursions, vaccinated and tested prior to disembarking but on excursions we are free to roam in the public and some ports were pretty populated in town and we are never tested again. Longer cruises may present some problems should the virus have time to inoculate and spread but overall I think things are well on their way to recovery."
Fundamental say that this is going to break out! Enjoy I know I will to $30!
The cruise lines will not be held down for long and will return to there original share price if you have been paying attention to prices in general guess what crise line price will also go up and that will send there profits to the moon.
I see many new goats in my future! Now if I could only find a toothbrush and some deodorant I’d be good!
"@Keith AKA @Jeff AKA @Mr. Clean AKA @Carn-Evil @Robert and 68 other usernames on this board. Every prediction you make is wrong. Also, earnings are from previous quarter so no one is expecting anything except your BS Psyco babble. Just get paid by your paid basher company and be grateful you have a job."
Hey shorty….you’re losing a ton of money trying to short CCL!
Added 4200 shares. Free money give away today!
"Ccl is fully book out from Galveston, Texas port."
nice turnaround...hopefully people didnt give up on cruising and with merk pill good news for those on board
"Not going away anytime soon. Enjoy.Two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are 90% effective against COVID-19 hospitalisation for at least six months but only 47% effective against infection after that period, according to a new study."
Where is @Keith to talk about Enterprise Value?
"Carnival is about to teach their shareholders a very expensive lesson. You cannot lose hundreds of dollars each second (ask Josh for the calculations) while expecting to have your investment grow over the next few years. Carnival is running out of every bit of potentially good news (first ship to sail from San Francisco since the Gold Rush). Carnival will begin their dilution of shares at the tune of 100+ million dollars very soon. Carnival could have brought in 40 million more dollars if they had started the dilution a few days ago, and management is kicking themselves for not having started earlier."
0 buying pressure...
"90% of Carnival US based ships will be sailing by February. More families will be on-board once the vaccine for children is introduced shortly. ""Carnival Cruise Line announced plans for more ship restarts for January and February, as it works towards the return of its full fleet sailing from U.S. homeports in the spring of 2022, according to a press release.With 17 ships scheduled to be operating by year-end, Carnival Sunshine will restart from Charleston on Jan. 13 and Carnival Liberty from Port Canaveral on Feb. 11.With today's announcement, Carnival's U.S.-based operations will cover the following homeports and ships by February, and represents 90 percent of Carnival's U.S.-based capacity:• Galveston: Carnival Breeze, Carnival Dream and Carnival Vista• Miami: Carnival Freedom, Carnival Horizon, Carnival Sunrise and Carnival Conquest• Port Canaveral: Mardi Gras, Carnival Elation, Carnival Magic and Carnival Liberty (effective Feb. 11)• New Orleans: Carnival Glory and Carnival Valor• Long Beach: Carnival Panorama, Carnival Radiance and Carnival Miracle• Baltimore: Carnival Legend• Tampa: Carnival Pride• Charleston: Carnival Sunshine (effective Jan. 13)"""
O that's smart. STRONG sell. lol. This stock does not like being below $25. At least you know you can HOLD at $23 to $25. And make a lot of money over the next year.
I live in puerto Vallarta next to the marina. Today I looked out my window and we had 3 cruise ships here. That’s the first time I seen that before covid started. The ships are going to be full with waiting lists.
"I don't want to discourage pandemic rebound trades, but do you realize that currently many travel stocks already have higher market cap than they had before pandemic due to dilution (including Carnival). It literally means they are all already overpriced since business hasn't returned to previous glory and they are all with huge debt now."
I'm good with 1% green everyday!!!! 3.5x my money every year! This will go back to $60 easy!
Price target increased to $41. Outperform. Credit Suisse. Ben Chaiken who was on earnings call.
Closing over $24 today.
"DAL trading down despite earnings beat because they said fuel prices up 60% YTD and 20% in just the past month so guided to loss again in Q4 despite bookings increasing with more business travel and huge pent-up demand for Europeans to come to US once allowed in November. Obviously, cruiselines have fuel issues."
Back to $31 this week. Will be 50 early next year. This is a great mid term hold! Buy now and hold!
Did I hear somebody mention my name about the goat Farm earlier?
Yahoo news - CCL launched the popular Princess cruise line on the west coast. January and February they will restart the CCL line with a huge agenda or ports. Read the news.
Who is selling as these prices ?! What the
Come on Mr. clean be negative you need to bring this down! Do you realize how much your opinion matters and affects the stock price. Please where are you at come save us shorts! Lol
"Since you never respond to this question @Jeff, @Robert @Kevin @Bill @Issay @Ice Eh (All the same person) I see you now moved further out your guarantee of CCL issuing more shares by February. Maybe they will or maybe they won't. You are usually 99.7% wrong anyway.I will ask once again, when are they going to announce filing for BK? I want to add a lot more shares to my portfolio but don't want to until you tell me when BK is guaranteed like you have lied about for 18 months.No response expected, again you tool. By the way are we still going to drop to $22.00 by Friday too?ENJOY!"
Soon things are going to be normal !
Gonna beat both top and bottom…. Breakout gonna confirm
"CCL should be sailing into the THIRTIES, there are many ""ocean cruisers"" with pent up demand for those midnight buffets! LOL."
Oceania Cruises Sets A New Single-day Booking RecordI assume this is negative news for the cruise industry too @Jeff?
Sure has been in a range 22.00 to 23.50 latelyWith Dow down today dragging most stocks done CCL hit alsoI thought it would of gone above 22.50 today. Held up early but fell on the Dow going down
"This stock has lost nearly $2 this week, whilst the stock market has gained nearly 1000 points. Good news isn't moving the stock anymore, financials are coming to the fore. Expecting this to get hammered with any market weakness and also just drift lower in between. Looking to make a long term investment around $16. Still think we see this within a few months, Enjoy."
"I’m riding this stock out until next summer. Some might critique this decision, but it allows me to ignore days like this and all the current manipulation in this sector. I truly believe all travel and hospitality stocks will be in a much better position by June next year."
@Ice Eh and @Jeff (Same Person) don't you think you should bring back @Harry Bawls and @Bill for the holidays. They will be coming to LA soon as well.ENJOY!
"This may go up, may go down in near future. But we all know you're only here because it will be at pre-pandemic levels soon! 2022 here we come!"
Keep squeezing the SHORTY…..they are ready to implode!!!!! CCL =$$$$$
"Good chance of breaking higher by EOW, possibly even tomorrow. Close in the 24s or higher would be SUPER bullish."
"seems like the stimulus stuff has slowed by necessityand interest rates are to move up more, maybe a lot more, eventuallyI am the last person to know if that's the case, but the fed is tightening going forward, it seemsthe debt will hurt them more if rates go up and they pay close to 2.5% (look it up)I just saw lower interest rate for them, but it seems I read on Guru Focus that it is around 2.5%could be wronganyhow, they have around $32B in debt in place to help beat them up"
Most time having knowledge or insight about a particular activity can as well be a pleasing exercise. I can boldly say that forex and crypto trading is one of the profitable money exchange services that elevates investors and their financial status
No sir I will not be tricked into buying the stock at $25.94 that price is too high!
I had to give back two of my goats back to the repossessor today. Please CCL save my village and help the stock go up to $30!
The only time I like something to go down as when my wife goes down not my stock!
Shorts are you ready for unlimited losses? Feels good... Stock is ripping and bulls in control...
Slow and steady moving higher. The news of people getting vaccinated is UP and this spells BIG CASH for CCL! Hold on boys…..
Profit taking from insiders
Tell them that blue oyster loves CCL!
Ccl. Don’t let slight dips effect your long term goal. Cruising is BACK.Ccl will continue to climb. $$$$ jg

"The interesting country to study is Israel. They had the highest rate of vaccined people ... and yet ... the new infected spiked to all times high.I have been watching CCL/RCL/NCLH ... and believe that NCLH is at risk at having to rise capital at a point in time.In the UK, they are thinking at implementing a firebreaker period later on ... the world opened a bit exageratel to save tourism industry and give fresh air to the population. I personnaly am not invested anymore in the cruise lines and expect a correction as figures of infections (delta) will be growing and CDC may tighten some rules or ... depending on how it goes and also how cruise operators will handle the sicks onboard. I sometimes play the shortcovering ... but in this situation ... 10% ... is not a lot and the stock could double (worst case for shorters) ...while leaving nice downside potential. Therefore i wouldn't count on shortcovering. I saw much more dramatic situation. And these guys are good at manipulating markets. ... i see no short squeeze in the evident future."
wth just happened? algos hit the monday morning sell button? shake out the sleepy retailers.
Well I’m a believer now CCL is going up to $30! The accumulation Is real!
"Good news are pouring in:MIAMI, Sept. 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- With Carnival Dream and Carnival Glory resuming guest operations on Sept. 19, Carnival Cruise Line now has 11 ships – representing half of its U.S. fleet – sailing again.Beginning with its return to guest operations on July 3 with Carnival Vista, the line is operating from seven U.S. homeports including Miami, Galveston, Seattle, Port Canaveral, Long Beach, Baltimore and New Orleans, providing guests with a wide range of options to get Back to Fun."
"A warning to shorts. I have actually turned down free cruises. Not my thing. However, I bought CCL because I know lots of people that Will cruise as much as they can, No matter what. Three or four times a year is not enough for them. Cruise fanatics are crazy. It's not a good idea to bet against their love for cruises."
"We're three weeks away from the earnings report. The June-August quarter will be ugly, which is expected. However the guidance for the next quarter and beyond will be better than Wall Street projects and it will move the stock higher. It's obvious that Delta impact on cruise lines was minimal. It's being mitigated by pent-up demand and lack of other options for travel."
I just purchased 10 shares to help my cost average $27 down a little
Hey guys! It looks like something is happening with the stock. Mr clean was very wrong
"Texas bans vaccine mandates for private businesses. Should this not impact CCL's vaccine mandate for its embarkation cruises in Texas? Of course, I am biased as negative on the stock price of CCL, but notwithstanding it is legitimate question. I am not even sure how CCL manages the mandate that disallows asking to vaccination status for guest in Texas."
"This looks like a good play. Chart looking good and cruises starting back up. Like, what could possibly go wrong here?"
"The cruise ship operator is looking to syndicate a secured loan maturing in 2028 to replace a chunk of the 11.5% notes that it issued in April 2020 to boost liquidity while Covid-19 halted travel, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
I am Surprised with today's drop in price since holding up so good with yesterdays market dump.Any thoughts on why dropping today folks. Don't see any bad news etc?
"Squeeze today; crash tomorrow (Monday). The earnings are not there. . . . margins are terrible. 1,000 X $2,000,000 loss = (-$2 billion dollars) ????? Hello, McFly !"
We should correct to 22 below
Oh the beauty new ship MARDI GRAS is a gem! Of course the new one coming ENCHANTED PRINCESS and 2022 DISCOVERY PRINCESS and also the CARNIVAL CELEBRATION. Travelers will want the NEW ships to explore and CCL is booking up! 2022 is going to take my $12 to the 70’s …..YEEEEE HAAAAAAAA!!!!
Look at the scoreboard Mr. clean! How are you doing? No response needed.....
Today is the day that Mr. clean said that the stock would close under $22.50! We shall see!
"Why bother for short term, just using this to add more stocks to my portafolio and checking in a few months if not 1+y carnival will get back up its just a matter of when."
YEEEEE HAAAAA……CCL to the moon BABY!We’re going to have SUM fun on CCL!!! Buy buy now!
"College football stadiums are full , how much longer do you think it will be before cruise ships are full too ? It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out , everything is opening back up ! Cruise on my friends "
28$ today
1/3 of our average volume in the first 25 minutes. We're slowing gaining traction and will be at ATH within a year! You'll read the comments about how it will take years to get back to $60.... I read those same comments when I was in at $9 a year and a half ago. Don't listen to them. The ships are back in the water and taking reservations! Buy and hold for a year and you'll be happy with your long-term (1+ year) gains!
"Shorty..,,CCL Is not a game…you trying to wack the price down with negative words and shorting the stock will only frustrate you….this is obvious. You need to start looking at the company as a whole and where it fits in with tourism and the present decline of covid deaths. Notice I don’t say covid cases as covid is here to stay just as CCL is. Bon-voyage shorty……we’re sailing."

People always talk about earnings and how it’s going to bring the stock down in 2 and a half weeks.......truth of the matter is is that ccl had only gotten better in the last quarter. How could it be worse we are actually cruising.
green tomorrow?
This is consolidation from all the people that bought when it had its mini spike. It's fine. We all know we had the previous wall of $24-25 back and forth for two weeks. If it stays above that wall and we build a new wall above $25.00 we're good!!! This is a great company to be a part of and very soon it will be profitable! $70+ on the horizon!
Looks like CCL might be going up from here.......
Keith where are you be?
doesnt matter about fuel price going up.. This stock trades with oil . look at oxy. everytime oxy goes up with the price of oil this stock goes up. oxy is down today and oil is down and guess what. ccl is down

"Great day for CCL today. This is just like a win after the market is getting pounded. I would say the ""FAKE"" shorts are going to be in trouble. ENJOY!"
Not a good sign today!
Nice bear trap today. I bet we'll hit 24.50 tomorrow.
"All cruiselines will going to be talking about much higher fuel costs coming up. Hello? You see what oil prices have done in the past 2 months - WTI gone up 20%. Worse, cruiselines burn the bottom residuals from refineries. These are low value products. However, with gas prices in Europe and Asia now more than double oil prices some utilities there will burn oil. Granted, only a very few can switch to oil, but you only need about 1 million barrels to make a huge difference to the price of bottom residuals (i.e., the dicount to WTI will be smaller) as power plants that burn oil tend to burn the gunk too. If the world consumes about 100 million barrels per day about (I think) about 15% would be residuals."

"Some perspective:Dec, 2019 CCL had debt of $11.0B and cash of $0.5B for net debt of $10.5BEnd of Q2 CCL had debt of $30.0B and cash of $7.0B for net debt of $23.0B.So net debt up 12.5B - That doesn't matter.And average interest rate way higher as CCL did some real high coupon debt during the Covid crash.And you can't just look at net debt, CCL now feels it needs to hold a lot of cash that generates zero interest income, but has debt that pays a lot of interest - very inefficient, but no choice as needs CASH liquidity.CCL still gonna burn billions the next 3 quarters. I will bet they will issue more equity after Q3 especially as stock recovered from summer lows and popped after Merck Covid treatment news."
"listen. . . 3rd quarter Revenue was $0.30/sh and 3Q net earnings was (-$2.00/sh). This is major loss and is unsustainable. CCL has $32 billion in debt. If 4% interest that is $0.30/sh. So, right now the revenue stream can barely cover the interest on their debt, let alone all the other expenses that they have. CCL is in big trouble."

I'm selling my 340 shares. this is inevitably going down to 20$ ish again. I'll buy back in when its lower
Why ccl doing so bad compared to nclh?
This pop in cruise stocks allowed me to short again. Stocks are ridiculously over-priced and expectations unrealistic. Debt has piled-up and interest expense a major additional burden. Watch for more equity issues after Q3 especially f stock prices stay around here. People got excited about CCL CEO saying Q1 cash flow neutral. He was talking operating only - not after CAPEX. So I think CCL still going to burn lots of money even into Q1. They say bookings as good as 2019 and prices higher - did prices go up enough to account for huge inflation of costs since 2019? Hello...food costs. Hello... oil prices way up. Did well shorting it last time - This pop gave me a second chance.
"I guess I should sell. Everyone of these shorts in here tell me to. No, I think I'll hold on to my shares. I do like it when shorty gets nervous."
What up Robert? What up Jeff? Y’all told me to short this thing and it keeps going up!

"Price dropped today because the CDC now recommends that passengers get a COVID test within two days of boarding a cruise ship, a shorter time frame than before. But actually it's a good news because now it's important to make cruising as safe as possible to get more elderly people on board."

As part of its release last week, Carnival said that it burned $510 million per month in the third quarter of 2021, showing just how costly it is to run a cruise line that's still not at full capacity. The future of the cruise business really comes down to when customers will be comfortable traveling in even larger numbers. Carnival said that it was only operating at about 35% of its capacity at the end of August, so there's a lot of room for improvement. But management also expects to be at just 75% of capacity by June 2022, showing there's a long recovery ahead. Given the sheer cost of owning and operating cruise ships, this is an industry I will stay away from. Cruise stocks might have recovered nicely from the depth of the recession, but the business is still in shambles and will be for the foreseeable future. Today's pop is nice based on positive comments from the industry, but the reality is that fundamentals are still very weak, and until that changes I'll stay out of cruise line stocks."
"I get it, CCL had to take on major debt, but it will get back to pre-covid prices. It may be 12-18 months, but certainly probable. If they were to file bk, it would have been announced by now and fund managers wouldn't be buying."
New CCL sleep POD cabins!Sleeping on a bed of CASH! Thank you CCL!!!Reserved only for LONGS!
Easy money  Buying a few shares here. Way oversold
"wow, my mistake, CCL had a $20B yearguess the cruise business was/is as big as the burger business"
"$28B in debt and losing moneyMCD has $51B in debt, which is HUGEhow much does CCL take in compared to MCDand MCD has a dividend 2.2%, I believe"
"With the shareholders licking their wounds, not much time to be chatting. The set date for share dilution must be near."
Today was the last time you saw Carnival trading below 23. The climb to 30 and beyond is set to continue.
"As much as I truly hate Robert, Jeff, and all the other negative shorts BUT I have to admit the stock has not done as well as I thought it would have. That’s all I’m gonna say! Not a pumper I’m not a dumper.......Just an investor who used to think this was going to do like AMC and go through the roof but clearly I was wrong and all of this might’ve been priced in the whole time"
Fantastic deals on cruises right now with 'lots' of availability. No problem hopping on at the last minute. What a deal with a 70% cap. You might have a blast but the shareholders will be left holding their bags.
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Ccl. Shorters are going down. Lol ccl is now on line for much higher stock prices.
Nothing but a G thing baby! This is going to $25 by the end of the week Mr. clean!
Keith - I’ve been waiting for 3 months for your $18 prediction to come true. I’m starting to think that maybe saying it over and over again on a yahoo board won’t actually make it come true. Who knows though.
"Yeah we're going green again! This is awesome consolidation! With the whole market red by a lot, we're staying afloat in a stock that has been hit so hard. This is what hope looks like! We're going back to normal and with normalcy, you will see prepandemic volumes on this stock! The ships arent going anywhere and are here to stay! 2022 will be a great year!"
Buy all of the CCL you can!
CCL @ $.75 cents a day gets us real close to $30.00 by Friday's close!
"Bought at $22, sold recently at $26.50. 20% is nice :)"
Buy all day long easy money  insane drop they have a ship that runs on natural gas..
"What perfect earnings for the times, very good news!!"
This is probably one of the most lousy investments one could make. Sorry I ever invested in the stock! Bag holding at $27.13! Boy was I duped on this one again!
"Conference calls, quarterly reports, charts, blah blah blah. At the end of the day sentiment moves the stock. Study the financials all ya want the market has a mind of its own. Yeeeehaw"
positive cashflow. all that matters.
"Hedge funds will start piling in looking ahead 12 months. By summer ‘22, cash should be flowing in and recovery in tact. $32 is a fair target. Beyond that depends on debt strategy."
Look at yahoo one year target they took it away bankruptcy will happen
Looks like Ccl couldn’t hold nice correction to 20 very soon
@Keith It was wonderful trade. Made $2400.00 in only a few hours. I would call that glorious. At least I actually own some CCL. You are just here as a paid basher and don't even own any.
Just sold all of my shares for a loss
Well I just lost another $2000 on CCL!
Wow! Great after hours news.
"At the current rate of loss, they only have enough cash to last till March 2022 before before more dilution or borrowing more at even higher interest rate - that is if any bank would lend. Delta infection rate is still increasing and could last well into Spring next year. This is very dangerous. Can anyone give your bull thesis to invest in CCL that I am missing?"
@Ice Eh is @Jeff's alias # 73No legal threat. It is a certainty. Done deal and a very easy one at that.
CCL will be in the 40$ by spring of 2022
We arent leaving!!! This is bound to recovery to $50+ and people know it!!!!
Robert read the fresh article that just came out one minute ago on market watch. It ain’t going down from here slick Rick!
I’m visiting the new CCL ATM…..it’s called EASY MONEY!!!
I’m going on a Cruise Y’all!BUY BUY BUY!!!Guaranteed $70 in 2022!!!
"Did you cover your short??? Covid cure, stock moving up and to the right!!!"
"Yikes, fuel oil prices going up. From FT ""US oil prices rose to their highest level in seven years yesterday after Opec and its allies refused to increase crude production further, resisting calls from the US to help tackle a global energy crunch."" In addition, many Carnival passengers are using Future Cruise Credits on board which means that they are not using cash. How will this impact Carnival's shares? Oh, I know ""Carnival will be $30 by the end of the week""."
Shorts are scared.
CCL heading to the 70’s…..if you don’t own it…BUY NOW…..RIGHT NOW CCL =$$$$$
As much as I would like to believe this is going to go up from here I get this feeling that this isn’t the end of the dip
Covid on the rise ccl should correct to 21 soon
Oh Keith one day you will learn my child one day! I know you miss owning the stock because you just don’t know when to buy back in because you’re cheap!
"2 couples I had lunch with last Saturday recently (2 weeks) got back from one of the Carnival cruises that left from Miami. They had great times, said food, entertainment, and room service was fantastic. All the crew wore masks but maybe 1/3 of the passengers did but said no crew members said anything if you didn't have a mask on. The mask rules are ""recommended guidelines?, not requirements. They also said the onshore areas were pretty much mask-free. They are retired and have another cruise booked in November and March one to Panama and the other to Alaska."
What will earnings look like next month? What are the options indicating?
"""Cruise ships will return to San Francisco with a record 127 port calls expected in 2022"" per CBS. People love taking cruises."
"Carnival does not issue news releases when cruises are cancelled. Here are a few:Due to a full ship charter on Regal Princess on July 30, 2022, we will be cancelling the following cruises:• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 16, 2022 • Mediterranean with Greece Isles, France & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles & Turkey 7-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles, Italy & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 30, 2022So, Carnival found a better customer (full ship charter), and pulled the rug out from underneath hundreds or possibly thousands that had already booked. Management not only jerks around customers, but also shareholders."
believe your eyes. look at the football games. covid is over. this is third week of college football. no out brake. airlines are opening up.
"Cruises are gonna miss a significant component of cruisers - Canadians. While Canadians can now travel to the U.S. they need a PCR test to return home. Imagine taking a cruise and then one member gets infected and then what do you do? You are not allowed to fly home. So you need to stay in the U.S. But where? How many hotels will allow you to check-in when asked if you are sick? If I am wrong and it is not a disaster situation then someone can refute me on what a Canadian family does once a member gets a infected? Canadians make up around 10% of cruisers. And most unvaccinated Americans stillwon't be going on cruises due to restrictions on their movement, especially ports of call in many places in the Caribbean. Cruise lines simply have a much smaller current TAM. Now that everyone relauunching ships I expect prices and/or load factors will fall. The numbers been good only because of lower availability capacity and pent-up demand that is a blip. Just look at demand for resturants coming off the boil where many people ate out a lot after being cooped-up. sure restaurants still doing well, but much lower than the first few months after reopening because much of the pent-up demand has been satiated. Same will happen to cruises in 2022 especially if almost 40% of American's remain unvaccinated and if Canada continues to require a PCR test to come home."
Volume is still beautiful! Keep it going! Back to $30 hopefully by next week and that'll be the new floor!
"More good cruise news: ""Norwegian Cruise (NCLH) Plans to Resume Full Operations by April"""
Max must be the new Mr. clean SMH!
We are about to launch... 22.80 is a key level... next stop 23
Lots of options next Friday @$22.50. Don't think it will finish higher than that this week coming. Enjoy.
"This stock if it closes this far and the green will open up on Monday at $24 just like that! Looks like the sleeping bear might be coming out to be a big old bull ready to be the next bull to run like amc and gme. The accumulation is here and solid with many quality bag holders, with a big push or rotation of trading this stock could easily have a quick run up to hit $30 before October 1st! Bankruptcy come on Jeff lol stop please that just shows that you’re in your moms basement jerking off! Lol."
"If Bit Coin has the potential to be main line currency in the future, how can this work when the value fluctuations are so much? The main stream public will not take a gamble on their day to day wages being high one day low the next."
Great global news this morning about relaxing travel restrictions. Shorts are very disappointed with minor losses today on big down market day.Looks like all of @Jeffs 72 personalities will be in big trouble. ENJOY!
"I'm not sure who it was. but he told me he shorted ccl at 23. I asked him why and he said you'll see. now I ask, when?"
My friend had just came back from ccl cruise out from Galveston port.They are fully book.
"I honestly believe this stock will go up again. Before the pandemic hit, everyone I knew, (including myself) were booking, or leaving on a cruise; it's still the cheapest way to travel & visit different countries. I'll hold my 800 shares, & may buy more, when it drops further, to cost down my average of $28/share. Cruising will definitely make a come back next year."
"I recently invested $250,000 between CCL,CUK,NCL. I don't plan on selling until we get at least double from here. Make no mistake todays prices are a great buying opportunity. Glta"
"SLOW, very SLOW grind up since July from around $20 to $26. If CCL will reach over $30 by EOY, will be a very positive long term sign. The high cruising season will start again in March 2022........and unless there is some nonsense about COVID, I expect CCL to reach old highs just prior to pandemic around $50.Be patient and you will rewarded....... COVID is BS and sooner than later the people are recognizing its over and is now nothing but a political tool."
We see El Pez Gordo is down one goat from his herd this morning.
I read somewhere many yrs ago that if you place a sell order at a very high price on your shares that they can't borrow for short selling the CCL.stock. Comments?
"Keep pushing this higher people, Need to short this for max profits, Technicals are getting worse by the day and this is going back to $20. Enjoy."
I guess Mr. clean finally left the board since he predicted that this would go below $22.50 on Friday! Lol you definitely got that one wrong! It still hasn’t gone there yet you are sorry
It should be $40 by December
I cannot wait to watch the stock go to $40 so I can buy my first of many 7-Eleven’s! I will then be able to have free Slurpee’s anytime I like!
I have to confess el pez it’s 87
Sums up your knowledge. How's that working out for you!!! EnjoyEl Pez Gordo 2 days ago$CCL conversationAdded 4200 shares. Free money give away today!
