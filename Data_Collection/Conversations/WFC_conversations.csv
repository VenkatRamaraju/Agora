Not selling less than 80
"Sold our position last week. It was a double for us ... rode it from $24 to 48. A 54 week investment.Bought mostly Draft Kings, Tilray, Wheaton Precous Metals, Barrick Gold and GDXJ. All the best to everyone ."
Ready for $50+
"I always thought that it would take a strong argument to change my primary Credit Card from the AMEX airline miles card to something else. Well, the something else is: Well Fargo 2% Cash Back Active Card. A wise person once said, ""Cash is King""................she/he was right."
From 20 to 50 plus a small dividend. Good comeback
I SOLD WFC because of their gutting of the personal credit line.Regret it.A...cause I didn't understand the whole personal credit issue and B... it us the hottest Bank stock out there....a real killer!
"Smart to start a position in the financials $MS $COF $JEF $GS $BK $WFC $C $BLK $BX if you haven't already. No need to take big bites... adding shares gradually over the coming year should do. Of course, pullbacks are to be exploited. gl2a."
well that sank fast at the bell
Hello $50 my old friend.
"I was lucky enough to get at $22 and now looking to get out. I own other banks (JPM, MS, C, BofA) which are better long term values. I have never really like the WFC brand or franchise and all the other banks have trading arms and global reach. WFC is just a big US bank and I think upside is limited. So what do to? Sell covered calls at $55 and be happy it will get called away and I have a huge gain or try to wait 12 months to take out $60?"
Even the chairman is out! Charlie and Steven will move Wells into the right the direction now.
The 3.2T stimulus bill bleeds green new deal initiatives that force clean energy mining. $jp $wfc are in crypto so we are ok
Are we getting a new 52 week high today? Let’s rise!
This is a perfect example is how you have to understand the sentiment. I don t agree that financials is the way to play the next several months but everyone else is thinking that.Tech will run in the 4th quater..but this quarter is all about finacials.
Getting closer and closer of capital restriction release.
"Definitely have potential but its gonna be corrected Definitely, going to take some profits and play on the dips"
"If you have not already, today/this week, is the day to snap a buy on WFC.Reasons: big cup and handle on the long term charts Probability of asset cap removalEntering second phase recoveryand the bank is fundamentally well.Each to there own but we have been waiting on this week since March 2020, meme stonks don’t even know what the moon looks like, they’re too busy chasing stars"
"As said b4, WFC will clear $60 by 2022-end. The road to $60 will be choppy, impacted by COVID and its impact on the US and world economy, but when the calendar strikes December-22, those who were patient will be rewarded.Remember, nothing good in banking happens in a hurry. Value investing in financial stocks covets the proven path, where boring but steady progress toward a stated goal is optimal. That is the path WFC is on and when it ends, WFC will again rival JPM for largest market cap for US based financials."
"Here is a post of mine from 5 months ago: Pitty some failed to read it.When investing in individual stocks, it is rare to have an advantage of knowing how certain events will eventually turn out. However, at this point in WFC's recovery you do to some degree. While event timing always remains an exact unknown, you do know that the following positive events will eventually come to pass and incrementally have a positive impact on price:-> The asset cap will be lifted at some point - the new BOD and our friend Charlie will see to that-> The expense structure will improve over time as evidenced by improvements to the Efficiency Ratio.-> Dividends will increase to the norm-> Stock buy backs will restart to best leverage WFC's excess accumulated capital-> The new management team will only get better over time-> The 232,000 Wells Fargo employees remain committed to their clients and the company as a whole.I've been a client of Wells Fargo since 1987 across most of thier business lines. I'm Long, expecially since early November 2020 and am patient. As Charlie Munger has often said; ""the key is in the waiting""."
I was looking for entry point at 30 but moved up fast in Spring. got 5000 shares at $36. Rock on!
Strong day for big banks. This is just the beginning. Yields will continue to rise as the fed begins to ease and the buying ends. And that is just one of many catalysts as the economy continues to recover. Good times ahead.
"So what is everyone exit price. I can’t see much more upside here, although Jpm is at 90$???"
"Will take my KMI, EPD, RDS and MMP dividends and purchase more WFC and BAC."
"Undervalued, catalysts including a full dividend revival and removal of the asset cap upcoming."

"It seemed the current market is very concerned about the ""forecast"" economic slowdown and isn't care about the tapering, so some people start to chase tech again which has been a dead money for several cases. An intelligent investor knows he should not move with those herds, instead he should take advantage of it and outwit the herds..."
"Mr Market is making a mistake currently, an intelligent investor knows how to take some advantage of him..."
Kudos......Exec Mgt realizes the mistake they made and reversed it. Personal LOCs reinstated. Hoping Scharf goes on to rid the company of the myopic nit wit(s) who made the original call. We'll see.
"Well, well, I guess WFC isn't ""Tone Deaf"" afterall and has reversed their decision to end personal lines of credit, but simply to not offer the product going forward. Good move Charlie."
$50 is so close I can taste it!!!
It's looks like my strike price of 51.50 by the 13th may hit and I break even.
Who’s been eating well because of this stock.
Is there anywhere you can watch an equity ticker live like they do sometimes on CNBC.?
is it true that WFC is having the cap removed within 30 days?
Taper tantrum when the tapering is not even started yet. Nasdaq is in green??? Good luck to those that still chasing high growth tech stock.
In Charlie we Trust. Grinding our way to $60.
Let’s hope rates keep rallying.
Dividend Doubling Declaration Date today?
Back to 50 before you know it
"stanstentruckerrighterjoflo or whomever you one person are, I think I finally muted all 75 of your bots. I have had a clean WFC conversation list... (well, pending the ""market bubble burst) for at least a week."
