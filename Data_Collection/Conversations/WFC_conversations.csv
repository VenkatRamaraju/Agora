This market is really bi-polar. Or the big boys are manipulating the short-term price to fleece panicky investors.
"The are buying back stock, cutting costs, P/E is 13, and rates can only go in one direction. BUY"
Only wish I bought more at $21 a little longer than a year ago
Just started position sold 24 45 puts and bought 2300 shares

Helluva day! Now let's see the divy upped to .30 on the back of strong earnings and send the shares firmly into $50's.
"Jim Cramer said hold WFC, new AAP guys said sell. You be the judge."
"WFC dropped because the loan segment dropped a little. That's to be expected since the country isnt all back to work yet. Profits went up over 50%, that's what I'm focused on. The rest will fall into place over time. Well's is a great bank, they are fixing the mess and I'm adding the dips."
"yahoo says all the banks reported earning beat , if so then why are they sinking today ?"
"Added 34k to my position today, stock should be trading around $71 a share."
"Though i won't sell my shares, the current market is very frowning..."
Dividend declaration on tap for next week. Prior 7 decl. dates fell on 26-28th. Expecting nothing less than .25 with potential for up to .30.
Dividend will not increase for 12 months. $ better allocated buying back stock.
"WFC stock price still have more room to grow, check the stock price movement history of BAC and JPM, WFC is way behind."
"stock price is way undervalued compare to other banks, it will catch up."
$60 soon !
I still hold WFC...
doubled the dividend along with huge profit per share and tons of buybacking. this is a 65 dollar stock once the feds get off their backs.....
"Stay calm, it will finish green and also a big increase in dividen will come. Remember Buffet, buy when everyone is fearfull."
Bought 1000 shares of WFC @$25 I’m a happy man
Good night wfc shareholders now I can wait for the dividend in early November. Thanks to all!!
"Having worked at BK, I don't really understand the allure of Charlie Scharf. Go back and look at his tenure there - same message. Going to cut costs and transform the bank. He must have supercharged that stock right? Nope. $44 to $41 on the stock. XLF performance during the same time frame? $22 to $27."
$60 by June-2022. The buy back program and earnings alone takes us there. Live long and prosper.
"Look for Charlie to again buy back stock aggressively in Q4-21, perhaps even more so than in Q3, which would be quite an accomplishment. While the cap continues to restrict asset growth, by default it strongly supports a strong buy-back program over the next three to four quarters. Quarter over quarter EPS comparisions will be eye catching. Expect to see $60 by January 2022 end."
Nice move today WFC$
"You have to sign a 20 Page ESIGN and signature agreement ONLINE now & Sign a form saying No class actions & binding arbitration ONLY just to see your Credit card balance online???? Is this the ""new idea"" of customer service at WF?"
Price to sales 2.64Price to book 1.14Book value 41.7Tons of cash on balance Had to post
I demand Wells Fargo raise it's dividend immediately.
"Repurchased 3% of outstanding shares in the quarter, 114M, $5.2B. That's the number I was looking for. They said $18B over 4 quarters and there was $1.6B last quarter. The next 2 quarters will each need to average $5.6B of repurchases"
"Nice cup and handle on this one with 21, 50 ,and 200 day moving averages one above each other. RSI above 50 and uptrend line intact. Looks like a winner."
Stephenie link CNBC she is surprised to see stock down after reporting strong qtr but one should consider this buying opportunity
Stephanie on CNBC: buy $WFC on weakness like today…. It’s on a multi year solid recovery process. Price to book is very attractive…
Looks like the dividend will remain at .2 cents per share. This shouldnt be a surprise to anyone and it is good news. Right now the money is being used for buybacks and raising the dividend would hurt that in a few different ways. I bet once the buybacks are complete the stock will be higher and they will be looking to increase it then. My estimate is Q3 of 2022...Either way it looks like the company is on a good path forward.
1.625% 10 year…
"Serious inflation problem while the banks are down sharply, this market is losing its mind. I would say this is a good time to add more shares..."
"Here is the 50 again, keep holding...."
"Looks like Warren has moved on, but people are still piling dirt on the best US bank but it keeps marching forward. Let's go."
"How the cap is going to help WFC weather this recession:They are no longer dependent on making money to boost stock price. There won’t be a slowdown in revenue that will hit all other financials. They have been forced to grow profits by cutting staff, not chasing new clients."
"Wow WFC beat estimated earnings last 2 quarters, it is up 62% YTD, up 118% for the year. Yet there are still dopes bad mouthing the stock. My only regret is that I didn't buy a lot more of this bank."
Nice turnaround...double since covid crash..new mgt new price
