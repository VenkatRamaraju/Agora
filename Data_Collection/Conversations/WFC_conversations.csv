"Wells Fargo has told customers it’s shutting down all personal lines of credit. Last year the CEO Charlie Scharf was whining that his pay was cut by about $2.7 million during the pandemic. His compensation for the year 2020 was $20.4 million instead of nearly $23 million. But yeah, customers personal line of credits need to go…. interesting. I don’t know about you guys, but this is the most corrupt banking entity of all time. Glad i’m no longer an investor and took my profits. Hope this stock goes to $0 and you all should do to."

"Here we go again, correction time. However this time, the repurchase program is locked & loaded and unrestricted. Bring it on down baby!"
Ok. This is not good. I thought I will keep adding when it is low. This much of a jump throws my plans awry.
From 20 to 50 plus a small dividend. Good comeback
"It seemed the current market is very concerned about the ""forecast"" economic slowdown and isn't care about the tapering, so some people start to chase tech again which has been a dead money for several cases. An intelligent investor knows he should not move with those herds, instead he should take advantage of it and outwit the herds..."

So tomorrow big guys being the shares back ip as they hold a huge portfolio on this stock. They picked up millions of calls this afternoon. I got lucky as I didn’t hold shares. I just picked ip some dirt cheap calls man!
"as always, the market is overreacting. but so far I'm not regretting getting out of WFC."
BAC CEO was on cnbc closing bell tonight. Followed by WFC CFO.
Great bounce WFC$.

"At this moment, I own 23000 shares. Waiting for the dividends to go back to $2 or more. I dream of the day the dividends hit $5 and I can retire. Probably not gonna happen for another 10 years."
Fed must be the only one buying this pumped up or Buffet
can you believe that wfc pledged 400 million to blm a self proclaimed marist organization................
"Here is a post of mine from 5 months ago: Pitty some failed to read it.When investing in individual stocks, it is rare to have an advantage of knowing how certain events will eventually turn out. However, at this point in WFC's recovery you do to some degree. While event timing always remains an exact unknown, you do know that the following positive events will eventually come to pass and incrementally have a positive impact on price:-> The asset cap will be lifted at some point - the new BOD and our friend Charlie will see to that-> The expense structure will improve over time as evidenced by improvements to the Efficiency Ratio.-> Dividends will increase to the norm-> Stock buy backs will restart to best leverage WFC's excess accumulated capital-> The new management team will only get better over time-> The 232,000 Wells Fargo employees remain committed to their clients and the company as a whole.I've been a client of Wells Fargo since 1987 across most of thier business lines. I'm Long, expecially since early November 2020 and am patient. As Charlie Munger has often said; ""the key is in the waiting""."
Lmao. Laughable. Absolutely no reason to crash 5 percent over some bs news. Lmao

"Mon, June 28, 2021, 5:35 PM EDTIn this article:WFC-1.27%Explore the topics mentioned in this articleMetalsMy WatchlistQuotesYoYoETFsView my watchlistsSAN FRANCISCO, June 28, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC) today announced that it has completed the 2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test process. The Company expects its stress capital buffer (SCB) to be 3.1%, which represents a percentage amount of incremental capital the company must hold above its minimum regulatory capital requirements. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has indicated that it will publish the Company’s final SCB by August 31, 2021.The Company expects to increase its third quarter 2021 common stock dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.10 per share, subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting in July. Additionally, the Company’s capital plan includes common share repurchases1 of approximately $18 billion for the four-quarter period beginning third quarter 2021 through second quarter 2022. The Company will continue to prudently manage capital levels based on its internal capital adequacy framework."
"Why is everyone in love with jpm stock, Wells Fargo stock has done 30% better year to date and 10% better over the past 12 months. EVEN WITH handcuffs on"
"People still do business with this ""bank""?"
"Why would you not put your money in the big banks, like MS, GS or WFC? Strong yield, big buybacks, strong performance/earnings and 2% 10 year by year's end. What am I missing? Seems so obvious."
Sure not so long ago it was 20$ and now more than double Do we have the best economy to justify it ? Ir is it a scam just like they know how to open fake accounts….

I expected WFC will hit 50 51 within the next week out. For some odd reason it sky rocket over the weekend. Which was pretty good for me. With my share in the stock. If I would have made my brought my call option last week. I could've capitalized on some bucks. But I wasn't confiendent. I'm still learning options and Robinhood setup
Capital restriction should be releasing soon.
This is bad. They are lucky if their stock doesn't half by the end of the week.
Even the chairman is out! Charlie and Steven will move Wells into the right the direction now.
"Sold our position last week. It was a double for us ... rode it from $24 to 48. A 54 week investment.Bought mostly Draft Kings, Tilray, Wheaton Precous Metals, Barrick Gold and GDXJ. All the best to everyone ."

Sinking ship
Nice close. WFC.
"Most institutional investors dropped financials this past month. It is a very crowded retailer holding. Maybe, we have a lot of us thinking about the same on holding bank stocks."
"I posted this same message sometime last year ---- when WFC was in a horrendous nosedive --- and I quote! ---- “Buying Wells Fargo common stock for the dividend while you are bleeding capital out the wazoo is kind of like sitting in a very comfortable lounge chair on the deck of the Titanic. You're gonna go under water and die, it's just a matter of how soon the ship sinks!”One year later, that is truer than ever!Ray Sizemore ----- June 29 ----- 2021 ----- 6:25 p.m."
Overreaction.
Wells Fargo Technology is bad. When was the last time you saw a new feature on your Wells account. Probably never or in 2010. 2 years since Saul took over nothing has happened. He loves big tech vendors ( who never gets into delivery) and hates minority/small tech vendors who gets the job done. I would be surprised he stays in the next year.
This is a perfect example is how you have to understand the sentiment. I don t agree that financials is the way to play the next several months but everyone else is thinking that.Tech will run in the 4th quater..but this quarter is all about finacials.
wells fargo knows whats about to happen
IF 10 year keeps rising . Going to 60
does this bank have 1.5 trillion of debt?
This is stupid.. so Bloomberg wrote something and the bank stock went down. Crazy how a pen can do to your pocket!
Tom = Walter…lots of poser shorts here trying to scare investors…hilarious…they make $.05/post?
"Of all the stocks that I own, I worry about WFC the least.Don't think twice, it will be alright ____ Bob Dylan."
"If it goes down a little more 41–42 I will be forced to add more, I’m already overbought but oh well I’m in for the long haul!!!!!!"
There was Fraud on my account Friday when I tried to sent a wire. What they did then is totally block my account. I can't pay my bills take out any cash. It going to be that way until and get a new Wels Fargo card. If they were like American Express they would overnight it. Wells Fargo I hope to get my card by Thursday next week.
"Worst bank ever....getting out of wealth mgt....what dopes. This is a trading vehicle only...when its goes higher on buyback and dividend news, sell it....buy MS or Lazard."
In Charlie we Trust. Grinding our way to $60.
Is there anywhere you can watch an equity ticker live like they do sometimes on CNBC.?
"The fever has broken, and WFC closes at the high, on a Friday."
Nice!!! Buybacks are kicking in I suspect! Sweet
"added, this sale doesn't last long, banking sector is one of the strongest in current environment."
Let’s hope rates keep rallying.
"Hello $50, Now let’s go get that $60"
Dividend Doubling Declaration Date today?
I was looking for entry point at 30 but moved up fast in Spring. got 5000 shares at $36. Rock on!
Holly Cow.
A nice recovery this week. Last week was a painful reminder to revisit the fundamentals and commit or not.I'm in the @Monday camp on the charts until proven otherwise. A long term cup with handle could be forming.Those who are long term know of the potential catalysts.With the right timing of same WFC could be a double from here at some point in 2024.I'm in.Good luck all.
"Market manipulator Motely Stool finally speaks some truth... ""But it might surprise you to learn that the best performing big U.S. bank is none other than Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), which has delivered stronger performance than its peer group by a wide margin so far this year."""
They just announced they are cutting off their personal lines of credit which coincides with the news that came out that there looks to be a lot more cases regarding Wells making fake accounts.
"This market doesn't make any sense, great Q2 stats, great future outlook on the economy and then market continues going down."
Bit of a disappointment since dividend was 51 cents a yr ago .
what happenedd?
"Isn't this exactly what we all wished for a month ago, an opportunity to put capital work? Let's roll!"
Wells Fargo $WFC today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2 per share up 100% from their previous quarterly dividend of $0.1$WFC also added $18B to its share buyback plan
People reacting as if Wells got mixed up in a new scandal.. same old drama same old settlement nothing new
"Well, well, I guess WFC isn't ""Tone Deaf"" afterall and has reversed their decision to end personal lines of credit, but simply to not offer the product going forward. Good move Charlie."
All the other banks raising dividends. Wells Fargo’s turn now
WFC buying back 10% of its stock means the stock price is very cheap as seen by management. It is equivalent paying 10% special dividend. I guess the negative posts are trying to keep it low to buy more shares.
"Wow, WFC just keeps soaring. I have a couple of thousand shares, but I wish I had loaded up more. I bought a large chunk of NWBI, but that is barely holding its own. It does pay a great dividend though."
Well Fargo strong like bull
"I generally agree with Robert and I like the previous point about renters, however, the bank did not terminate the lines immediately and allowed ample opportunity for additional advances against existing lines. In addition the bank is converting the lines to personal loans at termination with fixed payments. These loans will have smaller initial payments and a shorter payback even though they maintain the same rate (the math is simple, existing lines reduce payments over time and take longer to pay back). They are taking very little away from existing customers in an immediate sense. I personally had a line closed and I will miss the flexibility of using my line as a rainy day fund at far lower long-term carrying costs. I can do the same thing with a loan, but I expect it will be more costly and complex. This was a service for the affluent and if they do not make it easy and cheap to perform a similar function with loans, they will trend toward a slightly less affluent client base."
Always good when you bought in the 20’s and are playing with WFC’s money during the scaring out moments while the big guns are buying up the stocks selling. Hold tight and you will start cashing in some of their chips
CFRA upgraded WFC from Hold to Buy and increased price target from $46 to $52.
When the news breaks about WFC$ asset cap removal... EOY or early 2022.
Somebody knows something.......................nice day WFC.
"People finally come to senses, it is impossible to stop the pandemic immediately, we have to live with the virus for a while, and slowly reduce the infection rate until it vanish completely, the vaccine roll out in worldwide is in the fast pace, forget about the morons who refuse to take vaccine, they are just a small population, you can try to educate them, but DUMB and SELFISH has no cure. Recovery is in progress, so does all the recovery stock which is in bargain price right now.$BA $AAL $UAL $WFC $C $CCL $SPG"
wow excellent time to ad to my position soon 60+ the Fed have no choice but to lift their cap. also they put aside 12billions for purchase I bet wfc loading his wagon. easy money great dividend excellent CEO
Wealth Management layoffs next week
"Look for the dividend to be increased to $0.30/qtr in early July, Charlie moves incramentally. Also expect buy-backs to increase with improved earnings in Q3 and Q4. In 2022, expect dividends to move to $0.40 after YE earnings are released in February.The asset cap should depart in 2022, but when? Q2 latest."
Next stop is a new 2021 high of 49.25. Wheels up!
"Hedgies are desperate to keep it under 45,huge options volume expiring tomorrow with strike price 45.Hodl,and this will go to 48 in no time"
Summarily closing personal credit lines.....another self inflicted screw up. All in an effort to juice transfer fees to credit cards? Media is blasting away. At least this time it is all on Schifft without any help from Warren or the OCC/Feds.LG
"""Repurchased 35.3 million shares of common stock, or $1.6 billion, in the quarter"""
Buying opportunities are in full swing for a stock that should be in the high 50’s and day now. Easy money
is it true that WFC is having the cap removed within 30 days?
Wells Fargo has no future
"Big disappointment not to increase the dividend more. I was in Morgan Stanley which paid less dividend than Wells Fargo did, now we get the opposite. I dont feel comfortable about it. Could this be a SELL for Wells Fargo and should I go back in Morgan Stanley?"
"this is insane, what's going on???"
"With this good earning and value, nobody cares. While tech is up again with absurd value, an intelligent investor should sense the mistake of market is making right and take advantage of it..."
"Undervalued, catalysts including a full dividend revival and removal of the asset cap upcoming."
Would love to see a close above $45 today.
I'm surprised Algos didn't drop it 20% with THOSE keywords and sources.
WFC going to make a ton of money as economy continues to recover
going to get over $50?
The 3.2T stimulus bill bleeds green new deal initiatives that force clean energy mining. $jp $wfc are in crypto so we are ok
"Well, looks like WFC is sitting pretty. I expect it to head toward its 52 week high in the next couple of weeks. The company should be coming out with some very positive statements and moves. Good luck. WFC has been a big winner for me. I also have a lot of NWBI, a small regional bank that pays a good dividend. It is still modestly priced in my opinion."
$50 soon !
"No mystery here, not even necessarily buyback activity today. It's a jump  in 10 year treasuries. It's the real deal."
"rally into close my blow my mind. 10,000 shares since 32...almost sold at 40"
We buckling up￼
"First stop at $54.50;Accumulating Second stop at $63.00AccumulatingMy crystal ball stops there. After the huge market correction, WFC takes the lead, not lagging like the last time."
"Rolling, rolling..."
BUY THE DIP !
"Occasionally a whale pushes the wrong button. Not saying that's the case here, but it DOES happen. Good luck."
I SOLD WFC because of their gutting of the personal credit line.Regret it.A...cause I didn't understand the whole personal credit issue and B... it us the hottest Bank stock out there....a real killer!
just bought 100 more shares. small investor averaging up from 22 per share
"A relative has a WFC personal line of credit of $150K...and is current on the amount drawn (about 10K), but got laid off due to covid....so guess what...based on WFC news of shutting down the personal credit lines he has drawn the entire $150K....you think that is smart for WFC?..gosh, they really are a poorly managed bank...."
Big guys are buying calls now and tomorrow boommmm!
Kudos......Exec Mgt realizes the mistake they made and reversed it. Personal LOCs reinstated. Hoping Scharf goes on to rid the company of the myopic nit wit(s) who made the original call. We'll see.
"So what is everyone exit price. I can’t see much more upside here, although Jpm is at 90$???"
"I am a big fan of WFC both as a long time customer and shareholder. But one thing they have done recently really puzzles me. I have a WFC credit card. I pay my balances off monthly automatically and I charge a fair amount so they make money on the merchant side. I have a very high credit score. I have a mortgage on an investment property with them that I have paid off almost 4 years early. I have multiple accounts and have been a customer for decades. But I get a letter about 2 months ago from them saying they won't let me keep my current credit card limit unless ""I spend $4,000 on my card within the next 2 months"". The funny thing is that I have a lot of cards and this one has one of the lower limits and I have never even been anywhere near the limit. But suddenly I have to spend $4K just to keep the same limit I have had for years with a spotless payment record? That seems very odd and just bad business. The kind of thing that makes long term customers says ""bye-bye""."
"Smart to start a position in the financials $MS $COF $JEF $GS $BK $WFC $C $BLK $BX if you haven't already. No need to take big bites... adding shares gradually over the coming year should do. Of course, pullbacks are to be exploited. gl2a."
Regarding the technicals.A shorter cup with handle has moved us into the mid 40's. Consolidating since.If we see a new 52 week high thru 49-50 then...a much larger cup with handle chart points to a potential 64-81 target.catalysts-Dividend increase?10% share buy back?Loan loss releases?Expense ratio reduction?Asset cap removal or increase?Higher 10 year treasury rates?I'm in.
The 10 year note will not stay this low long !!!! Plus wait till earnings and see where they’re making money plus the buyback !!!! I holding and adding!!!!!!!!
"stanstentruckerrighterjoflo or whomever you one person are, I think I finally muted all 75 of your bots. I have had a clean WFC conversation list... (well, pending the ""market bubble burst) for at least a week."
"earnings schedule announced, Next Wednesday BMO. The 7 day countdown..."
What a beautiful stock
Can you imagine if we had NOT beat the quarter??!!? This is Wall Street manipulation at its finest!
"All conveniently timed for the last day of the month. Hmm, what portfolio managers got the tip first?"
"With all the ex-ceo gone, wfc finally found good Charlie, over 50 -54soon."
moving on up...and up....and up....
WFC creating value through raising the dividend AND reducing the o/s. What is there not to like? Raising the dividend to .20 still leaves plenty of room to grow moving forward. The future looks BRIGHT for WFC shareholders.
WFC. Great day all things considered.
Tomorrow WFC is breaking out and surge.
bought few sep 17 48 calls just now
Don't forget there is a $12B repurchase taking place. The cheaper the better.
In the green baby
"Someone or Mutual Fund just dumped millions of shares of WFC ? Can't find a bad news here ...What happened? Sudden drop 3+% in very short time ... :-(If no bad news, then stock will jump back up ...."
Are you ready for $50? Will the algorithm gods let it happen? WFC.
"I don't feel that management and the BOD dropped the ball when only doubling the dividend to $0.20. Sure, they could have elected to increase the dividend 200% -> 300% and thus provided additional support for the stock price. However, the wisdom of doing that runs at cross-purposes for a company that intends to aggressively reduce the number of its common shares over the next 2-3 years. It is a poor use of capital, or said with the bark on, simply stupid to do so.It is evident that the new BOD and Scharf are taking the long view when it comes to rebuilding the bank. Given the fact that Scharf is now 56 years old, this is likley his last large bank career assignment. Scharf's legacy will be dominated by how he performs over the course of the next 10-14 years, and not by what he did prior in the industry. These early years will be conservative ones, but the years that follow when the core profitability of the franchise is on full display and shareholder numbers reduced will be most interesting and rewarding indeed. So be patient and prosper."
Easy swing trade set up here. Worst case scenario we re-trace the 3 month support around the 42 dollar level. Going in with half of my position size and will average down if it retraces to that mentioned support. This will be an easy trade back to the 50 dollar level within a couple weeks time. This is a total short term over reaction based on old news.
"$48.81, Wells Fargo has $18 billion dollars to play with, could it be that they are trying to trigger a Short Squeeze?"
Someone should sue bloomberg for this hit piece.
Why ah is falling badly?
Charlie will defeat Delta!!! Lol
Don’t know about anyone else but I’m buying the dip big time!!!!!!!
"Nothing ever changes on this patently and incredibly Wells Fargo-rigged message board.Honest, virtuous posters attempt to speak of the obvious message board rigging that WFC commits on this conversation board on a daily, pardon me I mean hourly basis.Wells Fargo deletes their warnings.Others point out that WFC has deleted those courageous and virtuous warning posts by solid posters.And then those solid posters, in turn, have their after-the-fact warning posts deleted by shady WFC management as well.As I said before, nothing ever changes on this patently and incredibly Wells Fargo-rigged message board.You can check my yahoo posting history (unless WFC has already deleted it).I've personally witnessed the same damn thing time after time for many years."
"Any idea when the dividend and buyback announcement will come?, next week?"
So this is what you call a chill ride up no pressure
Tapering is coming and bank is falling???
"This is one of those moments when retail investors have an advantage of automated algorithm trading. Does not happen often, but sometimes. The Algo-trade detects a negative news story on WFC and then it's off to the races....sell sell sell.The retail trader can actually read, digest and analyze the tangible impact of the story.... Option 1.. Story is bogus and nothing happensOption 2.. Story has a sliver of truth and WFC gets a nasty ""Hurry Up"" letter from regulatorsOption 3.. Story is true and regulators slap WFC on the wrist.Option 4.. Story is true and regulators attempt to make an example of WFC.The problem with Option 4 is WFC has already paid most of the fines out. It's not like regulators can argue WFC isn't making payments, they are just struggling to make final payments given they can't clearly identify individual's true harm.So what is the probability that Option 4 actually happens. I'd say 5%....10%... 2%..? Regulators aren't going to come in and jack up the penalties/fines by some insane $$ amount. At the end of the day this has little chance of being tangible and every chance of being a nothing story in a few days.Let the Algo-Trades sell it down and take advantage of your ability to reason."
OVERREACTION!!!
Move your money to a Credit Union!
How can you not love WFC!! Great stock to hold over the past 6 months:)
Fed tapering on the horizon. Watch mortgage backed bond market. Yields >>> WFC$
Nice day WFC$
DOW needs to chill. WFC ready to go green.
"Management needs to make a statement, good or bad"
well that sank fast at the bell
I alway's feel sorry for the 9 to 5 guy that loses more on his investment than he made at work today.
"chart make it look over sold, Not sure though as we don't know why its down"
WFC just keeps shooting themselves in the foot. They have become the least friendly consumer bank there is. Now they are just taking away credit lines. Does no one at the bank have any idea how to create good customer relationships?
"Wallstreet acting like the CPI is big surprise, are they even live in the same world like normal people? Maybe they are too rich and don't see what's going on with PRICE HIKING ON EVERYTHING! Buy bank stock, period.$WFC $C $BAC $JPM"
"Posted earlier and got 1 like and 7 dislikes for spreading straight facts. Wells Fargo is slowly becoming irrelevant and you are just continuing holding such a dud, because of “value”. Here’s the facts, 30% of s&p 500 is tech. That will double by 2030. So why be in anything but tech? Biotech, Fintech, clean energy(tech), AI."
I’m just getting my little piece of the action!!!!!!!!
This wants to reach 50 so baldly lol come on now get the cameras ready
"Corrupted WF down, big after earnings, BAC down 2.00 5%. Both banks u cannot trust"
"I always thought that it would take a strong argument to change my primary Credit Card from the AMEX airline miles card to something else. Well, the something else is: Well Fargo 2% Cash Back Active Card. A wise person once said, ""Cash is King""................she/he was right."
Only 20 cents...MAJOR disappointment. Market Agrees! BOD and Sr. MGT needs to grow a spine.
Bye bye 52 week high...:)
I learning trade options in Robinhood. I currently own one share of Wells Fargo and about to purchase 100 shares on a put call.
I don’t like to put more than 10% in any one position but I might have to make an exception in this case !!!!!!
Nice beat WFC$
"I hope we just keep going up, but something tells me with this wierd market that this is gonna act out especially with monthly options beeing a thing, but hey if we can hold above 45USD that should be some good upwards movement for next week."
didn't WFC announce stock buyback?
How much can you rely on the Bloomberg’s speculators?
dividend has been doubled!
"When can Fed understand pumping more money to the market is no going to help the industry that dampened by COVID heavily, it just going to cause more bubble to growth stock, whatever aid/tool they have they should provide direct to the industry - especially airlines and cruise lines. They are using these heavily impacted industry as an excuse to halt the interest rate hike, and keep brewing higher and higher inflation. $WFC $AAL $UAL $BA $CCL"
Loaded heavily at $45.48 will hold for a while
what a disappointment
This whole game is rigged!!
"I'm sorry, but if this is not manipulation, I do not know what is. 12- days before triple witching"
Former CEO of WFC was on CNBC talking down economy and markets. Such a negative ship.
"My thinking is WFC could of released a smooth statement, ""We are working diligently to make amends to our victims"" and it could of cut off much of today's bloodshed. ""No comment"" didn't seem to be the right answer."
Sell now before its too soon!!!! I saw a NTFLX docu on wells fargo they bad people!!!!!
"Last week, Cramer said WFC was a great buy...I thought ""Hmmm....How many picks of his did I try and get burned ?"" So, I took a pass."
what does wfc have to do to go up.? produce gold?
"Rarity to get a sale like this, buy now before algos catch on"
I feel that this is a great buying opportunity on the dip today.
I don’t think it will pass 51$ who agrees
Will today’s fed stress test reveal allow WFC to increase dividends and buybacks? I’m optimistic.
banks have bottomed .. 2q reports will be solid. tough comparisons to previous years 2q but plenty of cash generation for buybacks. i am sticking with financials and cyclical trade. we are in lazy days of summer but i see better days ahead ..
$50 is so close I can taste it!!!
"""Alternatively, authorities could hold off on additional punishment to see how quickly the bank makes further headway in response to warnings.""This is way overdone. Almost like a manipulated short attack. Read the article. The regulators want WFC to move faster with payments. This is a threat. WFC will respond."
WFC$ Working our way to...
https://discord.gg/5vcBNPc
What’s going on???? There’s no news I can find
WFC buybacks
Bancolombia SA target price on August $40. Are you prepared ?
"whoops! It was only a matter of time. What Chuck had to do was clear & simple, identify and compensate your customers that you defrauded. And set-up internal controls and change the past culture so these crimes don't happen again! Too much to ask? Speculators now control WFC stock, once a long-term, buy-n-hold invstmt w/ a good divy. Now just a shell of its former self. Take the $$$ & run folks! Other banks are MUCH better investments long-term past, and future!"
why did the price go down? Is it because the dividend increase was so small? Will we see 42 again before 47? I would of thought it would of went straight to 47.
"How bout that Repurchase, should be in full swing today!"
"So it seems WFC stole the show tonight with a planned repurchase of 9.4% of outstanding shares? More if the share price pulls back some during the buyback period. Less if share price goes up, but who will mind that."
I feel that this is on the way to $48 per share very soon.
Between WFC and BAC I've never seen so much negative sentiment without BOT activity. I think modern banks are dinosaurs staring at a meteor with the exception of active investment/business development (M&A) banking.

If you compare WFC's div. yield with BAC's this could drop a lot more tomorrow.
Sell your crypto and buy financials today. Thank me in 6 months.
"Giving big boosts to my 401K, wish I would have rebalanced even heavier on WFC"
Pay attention to the volume on call options $49 this Friday and next Friday. You don’t need a rocket scientist.
"here come the left wing censors, no wonder verizon got rid of democrat left wing yahoo"
Great day WFC$
Buybacks have begun. Float looks about 28MM shares lighter today. Nice!
Great move exiting personal lines of credit that are inherently risky and moving to higher yielding less risky business! F Elizabeth Warren.
Banks are golden tickets
Are we getting a new 52 week high today? Let’s rise!
undervalued
"Barrons article indicates that WFC will likely raise dividend to .25 from .10. Frankly, that seems mildly disappointing given that the div was .51 before the pandemic and bank balances sheets are extremely over capitalized. Stock buyback authorized will need to be fairly significant to move the stock higher."
Any idea what happened to our stock price today? Damn.
This board is closed for the cleansing of anti-WFC posts. Please come back another day.
credit unions pay better interest. even though interest rates sooo low. but wfc is not the worst bank - with the new mgmt.
Dividend doubled .86% - 1.8% and $18 billion set aside for buyback for the next four quarters.
"Will take my KMI, EPD, RDS and MMP dividends and purchase more WFC and BAC."
Showing wrong balances is just around the corner. don’t know any employee who is happy there. Wells cant be JPM. Just faking it..
"WFC dividend doubled, 18 billion buyback."
Nice day. Crazy volatile market. $50 coming soon.
Who’s been eating well because of this stock.
BOUGHT SOOOOOO MANY AT 45.20
2 days to earnings - still holding well.
Warren can go get bent and nice job WFC in ending the line of credits…reduce their risk exposure and shifting focus to higher yield returns…maybe if the asset cap was lifted WFC would notNeed to consider such actions which I fully support 100%…much better for us investors and shareholders
"HEADLINE FINANCIAL NEWS""Wells Fargo share price falls to near book value as $12B share repurchase program gains steam"""
Heading for $60 by October-end. Expect $70 when Asset Cap lifted in early 2022 following Q4-21 earnings release. In Charlie we trust.
Heading towards 52 week high... WFC$
take that stan! gus! or whomever you are pretending to be today!
Hello $50 my old friend.
Is it because the bank is failing or are the personal lines of credit being held due to looming foreclosures and massive amounts of debt Americans will burden due to the free money train? We will see
The WFC west coast brain drain has commenced and will be in full swing by early winter 2021. You may have heard it here first!
I was happy to hear about the dividend cap being lifted. With excitement I checked my WFC stock and....
"Yahoo has to find a way to get the discord spam under control, this is ridiculous"
Ouch!Oh wait- flat for the month and more shares coming via reinvestment tomorrow. Never mind.Going back to work.
Getting closer to...
I hope after market goes well fingers crossed
Big dogs lowered price so shorties can cover and load up. Now up 2.5% on good earnings. Down 2% and now up 2.7%. Imagine that.
Just found out that Wells Fargo charges for check books. 100 checks will cost you about 18 cents per check (cheapest) or up to 60 cents per check if you want delivery in 2 days. Amazing.
Buying WFC under $45 is the best thing you can do today for your 2022 Thank me later
warned ppl 16 minutes ago they should sell when it was only -1.5 percent. hope they listened...
"While long WFC, I have to question if mgmt. is tone deaf. Why ever give Pocahantus any reason to open her mouth when simply letting the personal lines mature would have the same, but more orderly result over time? I understand the product as designer may hold a greater risk profile, but why force the issue by force closing them?Somebody in mgmt stepped in it."
Banks with big dividends being rewarded by the market this morning. It seems they miscalculated what the market prefers.
for whatever reason we are in a breakout...i believe

"10% share repurchase bumps earnings same amount, nearly gets them to a record $4.50 annual earnings WITH the asset cap in place. I'm seeing an ultra cheap Forward PE of 10 here, what am I missing?"
meanrevers is another gus stan fan...muted!
Not hearing the bashers now?? Fed lifts curbs on banks. Earnings coming in a couple of weeks which hopefully will include stock buyback and increased dividend! That should pop it over $50 and when fed lifts asset cap the rise will continue with conviction.
"I would like to suggest a one-time dividend of $1 per share, just to kick things off."

AM +2.46 to -0.07? WHAT IS GOING ON
Warren Buffett and Liz Warren - the two warrens did their best to drown WFC.
Today’s panic selloff was probably due to overly sensitive algorithms. Buying at a 6% or $3 discount should pay off by the end of the week.
"Unbelievable. Gains in the past weeks evaporated in an instance!I hope response from company will answer the points raised by the regulators. If not, time to remove the CEO and the BOD since they had been sleeping at the helm the past few years."
Excellent entry point! load your wagon easy money great price. overdone down. up it goes.
On 07-14/2021 WFC reports earnings; What do you think? Will it go up or down?
"Jim Cramer says kick all the other banks to the curb, but buy WELLS FARGO. Biggest position in his trust. Its not just an interest rate story its a turnaround story with new CEO."
Strong day for big banks. This is just the beginning. Yields will continue to rise as the fed begins to ease and the buying ends. And that is just one of many catalysts as the economy continues to recover. Good times ahead.
Taper tantrum when the tapering is not even started yet. Nasdaq is in green??? Good luck to those that still chasing high growth tech stock.
"As said b4, WFC will clear $60 by 2022-end. The road to $60 will be choppy, impacted by COVID and its impact on the US and world economy, but when the calendar strikes December-22, those who were patient will be rewarded.Remember, nothing good in banking happens in a hurry. Value investing in financial stocks covets the proven path, where boring but steady progress toward a stated goal is optimal. That is the path WFC is on and when it ends, WFC will again rival JPM for largest market cap for US based financials."
CHART SAYS BREAKING OUT!
Book value has already increased over 10% under new CEO Charlie Scharf (see the Earnings Supplement). Common Shares Outstanding decreased 33M vs last quarter. What's not to like?!
"Why is it taking so long to go higher, am I the only one that saw those excellent reports?!"
"While I was hoping for a larger dividend move, buying back stock aggressively in the 2H and beyond is a more efficent way to send excess capital to shareholders until the Asset Cap is lifted."
"Charlie just wants Wells to be like JPM/Chase... thats all folks! Cutting areas that are risk/low profit. No there are no more ""fake accounts"" , no more scandals, etc. Take your bash posts somewhere else. If you lost money, boohoo, this is a long game stock, not crypto. Go to Vegas if you want fast cash. I hear its nice this time of year."
"Let put it this way, the human nature is lazy. You can probably see the trend if you are not blind. A lot of people actually prefer the Covid situation stay bad, so that they can:- Stay home without need to goto work- Continue to collect free hand out stimulus check- Continue to collect unemployment benefit- Continue to buy the Nasdaq tech and growth stock, regardless how big the bubble is- Continue to short recovery stock- Continue promote Delta variant impact, prolong the current growth stock over value stock trend, so that they can continue to get easy money from share market just like last year.I am on the other site, that hope for things will get better and people can go back to normal life, that means:- I am worry about the economy impact to EVERYONE than Delta variant most likely just impact those that REFUSE TO TAKE VACCINE- I am worry about the free handout money, and country debt that keep piling up, and how much tax hike in future to fill the debt hole.- I am worry about company with value will eventually go bankrupt if the current trend remains.- I am worry about inflation that is REAL right now, than interest rate hiking.You can't wake people who pretend to sleep - that's the sad reality now, I just have to admit, some people just don't want things to get better, and it is reflecting on the share market now.Stock that got beaten up so bad and worth considering to long if you agree with what I said:$AAL $UAL $CCL $WFC $C $SPG $BA"
"Really surprised by the size of the negative reaction here, I'm in WFC for the long run so not bothered about whether it's a bigger dividend or share buybacks.I think long term WFC is a good pick but is it a better pick than a JPM or MS, that is the question?"
The wells repurchase program is a bazooka. Not just the sheer size of it but the fact it's happening at such a low share price
"Definitely have potential but its gonna be corrected Definitely, going to take some profits and play on the dips"
I'm going to buy a few at $45.30. :)
"more money will go into crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken etc. If you want to see your money dwindle in value and purchasing power, a traditional bank is for you"
Here comes the MONEY !!!!!
Wells Fargo is an absolute joke. I’m getting increasingly bullish on Fintech and blockchain technology. Young people are using neo-banks and payment apps. Blockchain technology such as Terra will enhance payment solutions as well. We will continue to use USD but in a more efficient way.
They had some interesting insights about WFC on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Double dividend and huge stock buyback sound traffic to me.
All 10 of the biggest U.S. banks crested about 1:10 PM except Wells Fargo which went sideways towards the close ...3 PM.

"Wfc the only stock that’s been green no matter what. Now with the new dividends, time to buy more !"
Certainly WFC is worth at least what it was before the pandemic. $53 soon.
Cup and a handle completed - poised to surge big now!Over $50 in 2 months!
"(Reuters) -Wells Fargo & Co's Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said the bank was not yet planning for the end of a damaging asset cap imposed by regulators after it smashed Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings.The Federal Reserve in early 2018 ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets below $1.95 trillion, until it had improved its governance and risk controls following a wave of sales practice scandals.The asset cap constrains Wells Fargo's ability to make new loans and grow as rapidly as rival banks, and Scharf has pushed for its removal since his appointment in September 2019.Asked by analysts if the bank was factoring an end to the cap into future projections, Scharf replied, ""We're not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap.""""The work remaining is significant, and as such, this remains a multi-year journey for us,"" he said."

Nice to see some and serious WFC Treasury $ in the market today. Any estimates for what the share count will be on 9/30 ? Down 5% by Q3 - end is mine. Longs - standby for the flood of capital to come.

I expect a formal response from CEO once they have all the facts.
Wells Fargo can now buy back more shares with the same money !
Many good hard working ethical WFC employees who put in long hours foregoing their own personal lives to service their customers. Some bad apples took advantage of a program rewarding them with income for additional sales. Banks have become everyone's whipping post.

Getting closer and closer of capital restriction release.
"18 billion buy back on 4.13 billion shares, should increase share price by 9 percent, that and doubling the div. not too bad. Now let's finally get the fed cap removed by end of year or beginning of 2022."
"I was lucky enough to get at $22 and now looking to get out. I own other banks (JPM, MS, C, BofA) which are better long term values. I have never really like the WFC brand or franchise and all the other banks have trading arms and global reach. WFC is just a big US bank and I think upside is limited. So what do to? Sell covered calls at $55 and be happy it will get called away and I have a huge gain or try to wait 12 months to take out $60?"

Wells Fargo appears to be a real sick puppy if this is the best it can do. Makes you wonder what else is wrong since it cannot get back to at least half of its pre covid dividend amount of .51.
I challenge the shills here to name a bank stock which is done better than Wells Fargo YTD or the prior 12 months.
