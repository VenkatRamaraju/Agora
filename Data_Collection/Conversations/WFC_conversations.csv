Does anyone know if CEO Charlie Scharf is still maintaining his office in NYC while WFC Hdqrs are in SF….
One of few large banks that had increased revenue q over q. Last quarter was close to BACs revenue for ~half the market cap. The CEO has done a great job and I have been buying in 20s and bought more on the dip last week.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"Frankly, with the stock repurchase program in full bloom, I rather like the mid-40's. We are buying 14% more shares for the same price, an unexpected tailwind come Q3-21 EPS results.The patient will prosper."
There was a big spike at the end of the day. Looks like everyone tried to jump on board at the end.
"Sold our position last week. It was a double for us ... rode it from $24 to 48. A 54 week investment.Bought mostly Draft Kings, Tilray, Wheaton Precous Metals, Barrick Gold and GDXJ. All the best to everyone ."
"Jim Cramer said hold WFC, new AAP guys said sell. You be the judge."
"Buy 1,000 shares !!!!"
"As yield climb, share going down, Wells can buy back more shares. Wells will have more room for growth and improvement as they work hard to solve the past issues. So not all are bad"
"According to a report by Bloomberg, Wells Fargo isn't sending restitution payments to victims of its numerous scandals fast enough, and regulators are apparently not happy with the progress the bank has made to change its culture.This is a big deal for a few reasons. First and foremost, Wells Fargo is still subject to the Federal Reserve penalty that stemmed from its scandals and essentially prevents the bank from growing. If regulators are unhappy with the bank's progress, this penalty could remain in place longer than investors expect.In addition, keep in mind that this is the first signal to indicate that regulators are unhappy with the bank's new management under CEO Charlie Scharf. Until now, regulators' anger has been entirely directed at the leaders in charge at the time the scandals were taking place."
They will continue to buy shares the CFO said. The cycle for banks is good sell otm calls
Reserve releases will be fairly measured in Q3. It is the level of share repurchase success and forward comments about more in the future. Taking share count numbers down aggressively in 2021 pays big returns in 2023.
"Give it two weeks. Give it two months. Give it two years....I’m thinking there will be a broad market end of year sell off, like every other year, but I’m going to hold. This stock will be at 55 to start the year, and you pick up 10-15% in January. 30% return fast."
With problems in China - banking stock in USA will become more attractive.. !
"Unbelievable. Gains in the past weeks evaporated in an instance!I hope response from company will answer the points raised by the regulators. If not, time to remove the CEO and the BOD since they had been sleeping at the helm the past few years."
"SANCTION ALERT!!Bloomberg reported that per people with knowledge of the situation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) have privately indicated that the bank might face new sanctions, ensuing unsatisfactory progress on remedial efforts and fulfilling its obligations."
So? settled a lawsuit is suppose to be bad news?
Why all the bank stock is getting hammered?$WFC $C $JPM $BAC
10Y T 1.546%. WFC will bounce.
Exited all my WFC between 48 and 46. Will wait to get in under 42. Very low quality earnings compared to other banks. Holding on to MS much better bank. And Better opportunities out there.
12 month return up 100%
"Beware of the middle management brain drain the last few years with replacement of less experienced or qualified leadership team in many business units. Market was expecting lifting of consent order limiting asset growth this year and recent news does not support this. I sold half of my WFC position at $50, but regret not selling all of it."
Trust is no longer exist in most of folks for Wells Fargo.
Wells Fargo reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over claims it overcharged commercial customers who used the bank's foreign exchange services. ... The bank agreed to pay $37 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the government in federal court in New York on Monday
CEO is trying to cool the market and do more buybacks on the cheap. stay with it in 10 years it will be $150 a share
It will test 52 week high before earnings! $50 coming! HODL
"Wells Fargo Shares Move Lower; Bloomberg Reports Co Could See Regulatory Action Over Speed Of Its Restitution Payments2021-08-31, 1:05 PMAugust 31, 2021 01:03 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Movers"
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-wells-105810570.htmlThus, the steepening yield curve, as well as expectation of solid economic growth, will benefit major banks' net interest margins amid a low interest rate environment. Though the Fed kept the short-term rates unchanged this time, there has been increasing expectations of a rate hike as soon as in the second half of 2022. This, in turn, will support major banks' top-line growth. With banks' financials directly tied to the health of the economy, investors are now expecting improved profitability for major banks in the quarters ahead."
Time to buy Banks?You can if you want to. However the time to buy Banks has already been here.
Good news today yet it is going the wrong way. Hope to see some positive movement next week.
"The US Government continues to PUMP NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) Tulip Mania Relentlessly and Artificially, DESPITE Skyrocketing HYPERINFLATION, Tanking Corporate Revenues, ABSURD Valuations, Collapsing Economy, Insanely Astronomically High Debt Levels and Record High Bankruptcies!$WFC $BAC $BA"
"stock price is way undervalued compare to other banks, it will catch up."
Closed my positions too much too fast
well that sank fast at the bell
This is the exact opposite of what I thought would happen. I thought we would have a run up the days before and then a selloff on the day of the earnings announcement. Trying to figure out the market lately is not easy.
Bank of England signaling sooner than anticipated rate hikes due to inflation. Mind the gap please! 
$44.83 low today.This shows you that WFC is valued at prices lower than $45.00 a share. Why in the world would you overpay for your shares?It makes no sence at all.
WFC earnings call 11:30 A.M.
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-bank-stocks-buy-ahead-202644144.htmlWells Fargo has been the top performer among the seven banks mentioned so far in 2021, and it is Katzke's top overall stock pick among large-cap banks. She says Wells Fargo has the most sensitivity to rising interest rates, and the eventual lifting of the Fed asset cap could be a key catalyst for the stock. Credit Suisse has an ""outperform"" rating and $55 price target for WFC stock, which closed at $47.96 on Oct. 5.Blah blah blah. We will see. Crazy unhinged market."
"I think they're better off accepting the asset cap and just doing LOTs and LOTs buybacks. Let JPM and BAC load up on bad loans to appease communist like E.Warren, it didn't work out so well the last time."
Around 700 shares in my 401K....A good day to hold WFC
"I own 4650 shares. While I don't completely agree with Warren, I too have lost patience with Scharf. If he can't sort things out in two years, I don't think he's up to the task. At the very least, he needs to be replaced with someone who understands this is an urgent thing to deal with."
Bank of america down 3 percent. This is green. This might double drop tomorrow if banks are down to make up for today. 5 percent drop in the cards now. But what do i know.
Time for Bloomberg to do another intra day hit piece. /sarc
"I read Warren’s effort as a last ditch effort to justify CFPB holding WFC down, five years out from the scandal. They know the asset cap is about to be lifted and they wanted to grandstand one last time. The reason she addressed Powell was probably because he is in favor of removing the cap. There is no legal justification for a government agency to be controlling a company after the stature of limitations for prosecution has expired. The CFPB is not a Court unto itself."
I should have never sold at $34 but than again I did buy it at $24. $10 per share profit isn't so bad.
"Going to mid 80s, all these nonsense noise is so the institutions can get in on the cheap."
Wells Fargo Technology is bad. When was the last time you saw a new feature on your Wells account. Probably never or in 2010. 2 years since Saul took over nothing has happened. He loves big tech vendors ( who never gets into delivery) and hates minority/small tech vendors who gets the job done. I would be surprised he stays in the next year.
big hedges are loading on this opportunity...they just shook the tree and all weak hands are gone! $55 is where this is headed next!
They have been operating under the asset cap for 5 years... 5 years of pelting shareholders with dividends and share buybacks.
I am sick of the the good earning report keep tainted by the so called 'cap' that kept bringing up in news title. The 'cap' is already baked into the stock price LONG LONG TIME ago.
"Stay calm, it will finish green and also a big increase in dividen will come. Remember Buffet, buy when everyone is fearfull."
Green tomorrow adding more on the cheap.
Did they announce their dividend and ex date?

I demand Wells Fargo raise it's dividend immediately.
"Seems weird out of all the businesses out there, she picks WFC. Maybe they charged her a late fee or something and she still hasn't forgotten "
"The company reported that, effective at the end of the day yesterday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) consent order issued in September 2016 regarding the bank's retail sales practices had expired.""The expiration of the CFPB's 2016 consent order is representative of progress we are making,"" Scharf said. ""We have done substantial work designed to ensure that the conduct at the core of the consent order - which was reprehensible and wholly inconsistent with the values on which this company was built - will not recur."""
"There was a time when I almost respected the early ""consumer care"" views of Senator Warren. While I did not agree with the need for the CFPB to protect consumer interests, as other agencies were already filling that role and were focusing on improving performance, her views clearly had the consumer's interest center stage. But as time has progressed, Warren's views regarding ""banking reform"" have become less focused on the consumer and much more political in their intentions. She built her political career on ""serving the consumer"", but today's reality is she is using the consumer to serve her political views."
Just started position sold 24 45 puts and bought 2300 shares
doubled the dividend along with huge profit per share and tons of buybacking. this is a 65 dollar stock once the feds get off their backs.....
Sold out of my entire BAC position today and will wait the 30 days to move it over to Wells Fargo.
"we have dividend increase. no other banks can increase the dividend. This will push the stock which will irritate the so called ""progressive old lady"""
"You buy a company that willing to face the past and right the wrong, this is what the current WFC management doing now."
Bought at $45. Looks primed for a run to the 50s.
Buy TiGR. You’ll make a lot more money because it’s high growth and oversold.
"Earnings were excellent, but even more importantly as mentioned during the ER discussion by Scharf et al, because of cost cutting efficiency, improving loan demand outlook, transparency and regulatory progress, the future going into 2022 and beyond looks very bright. The stock should be mid-fifties already, and when the Fed finally lifts the cap, look out!"
$51 MO
0.09 PEG indicates super charged growth is ahead.
Six cents per share on the $250M fine. Big deal.
What's the problem now?
Well at least they can buyback more shares at a cheaper price now. If they can do that right. I still can't believe that after all this time that they have not solved the problem...Maybe it's time to hold some of the high paid execs accountable...

Don't listen to the shorts and their garbage. This is a $52.00 stock easy. Get some while it's cheap.
sale sale sale!
What is a reserve release?
37 mil fine! give me a break... they probably settled because they would save just as much in a week paying the lawyers.
"All the articles say Wells Fargo's problems started in 2016. They started long before that. In 2003 I took out a mortgage with a lender called Residential Mortgage. Within months Wells Fargo bought the bank and took over management of my mortgage. A month or so later I received a letter (not certified) saying my monthly payment had gone up over $400/month or I could make a deposit into escrow to cover the shortage. After inquiring why my escrow was short I was told is was because I had let my homeowners policy lapse so they took it upon themselves to insure the home and charge me the exorbitant amount. Here's the kicker. My annual homeowners policy had been paid in full at closing, and the loan was only months old. So I'm sitting there arguing over the phone ( w/ closing documents in my lap)with their representative and he's basically calling me a liar, saying they sent me a certified letter (which they hadn't). So while this is all going on I'm refusing to send in the extra amount and they're charging me a late fee every month. I had to go to my insurance company and get an affidavit of ""proof of insurance"" to finally resolve the matter. The insurance company said they had several complaints with the same issue with Wells Fargo. This has been going on for a long, long time. My ANNUAL homeowners was $1200, Wells Fargo was trying to charge me almost $5000 for the three month's left in the year."
Hope WFC bought some and more back this quarter while it was cheap.
Wells Fargo expected to report 100%+ earnings increase Q3–Reuters
"I bought at $45, why not"

This is restructuring play better to restructure while rates are headed up
Stephanie on CNBC: buy $WFC on weakness like today…. It’s on a multi year solid recovery process. Price to book is very attractive…

"""Wells Fargo request to Dismiss Shareholder Lawsuit, Rejected""! - Another ongoing suit brought about by shareholders like yourself, that WFC executives deliberately mislead shareholders on the status of the Bank in the early yrs after the widespread fraud was discovered.

popped to 48.3 after hours... Don't be surprised to see 49 again tomorrow!
Was the dividend increased? I read one article that said it had doubled from .10 to .20. But that happened last quarter according to my statement.
this company is turning around and is a great value at 47 for higher interest rates will come during second half of 2022. I prefer it to Bank of America.
WF has so many regulatory issues that this stock will lag. their new CEO would rather sell off division of the bank than fix them to meet regulatory standards. The new smug CEO was not the right fit.
Market down badly everywhere for the most part… not most of the bankssssss 
news is a bit confusing. did they settle for this issue or is the DOJ suing for a new issue?

Option 1.. Story is bogus and nothing happensOption 2.. Story has a sliver of truth and WFC gets a nasty ""Hurry Up"" letter from regulatorsOption 3.. Story is true and regulators slap WFC on the wrist.Option 4.. Story is true and regulators attempt to make an example of WFC.The problem with Option 4 is WFC has already paid most of the fines out. It's not like regulators can argue WFC isn't making payments, they are just struggling to make final payments given they can't clearly identify individual's true harm.So what is the probability that Option 4 actually happens. I'd say 5%....10%... 2%..? Regulators aren't going to come in and jack up the penalties/fines by some insane $$ amount. At the end of the day this has little chance of being tangible and every chance of being a nothing story in a few days.Let the Algo-Trades sell it down and take advantage of your ability to reason."
"Steady as she goes. Bank valuation isn’t a mystery. The stock price will just keep bumping up 10% quarterly. Previous high, with asset cap in place was 65. I can wait another six months, but probably won’t have to."
"Todays Labor Department's jobs report, which showed a sharp deceleration in hiring has the market down today. This stock is gonna bounce high Monday or Tuesday."
Seems suspicious not one person from WFC is making a statement about this!!!!!!!!!!!
"well...well...well.... Good ol' morgan stanley led by lil' jimmy gorman piles on Wells Fargo with a downgrade on the news of a settlement and yet more comments from the financial sectors nemesis, loco poco lizzy ""endless fines"" warren. One has to wonder what the motivation for ms could possibly be. Perhaps it's to accumulate a significant position in WFC at a lower price? Would ms actually manipulate a stock like that? The short answer is you betcha. I would consider this a dinner bell......have a seat at the table. As far as ""thin lizzy"" and her comments about breaking up WFC......adios una mujer vieja"
Market manipulation to the max
Warren is looking for a distraction for the house failing to take strong stand on taxing the super rich. They are taking a bite off of the middle class again.
"Repurchased 3% of outstanding shares in the quarter, 114M, $5.2B. That's the number I was looking for. They said $18B over 4 quarters and there was $1.6B last quarter. The next 2 quarters will each need to average $5.6B of repurchases"
Senator Warren is going after the Feds right now.... we should rejoice... maybe she'll leave WFC alone :)
Good night wfc shareholders now I can wait for the dividend in early November. Thanks to all!!
#2 gainer on S&P. WFC - I'M BACK BABYYY!
Doj suing FCW
"Positive news...NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co(WFC) on Monday reached a $37.3 million settlement to resolve U.S. government accusations that it fraudulently overcharged hundreds of commercial customers who used its foreign exchange services.The settlement filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requires a judge's approval, and resolves civil fraud charges against the fourth-largest U.S. bank.Wells Fargo (WFC) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In afternoon trading, the bank's shares were down 2.1% at $46.91.The San Francisco-based bank has been dogged for the last five years by a series of scandals over its treatment of customers, and has been subjected since 2018 to a federal cap on asset growth until it improves its operations and oversight.According to court papers, Wells Fargo(WFC) defrauded 771 customers between 2010 and 2017 by systematically charging higher spreads or sales margins on foreign exchange transactions than it promised, and providing financial incentives to salespeople for the overcharges.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Mark Porter)"
will come in lower 40's on monday
1.569% up+0.045 WFC$ #$%$ day.
Nice bounce WFC.
"Just went into a Wells Fargo to open an account for my wife. We were ready to drop 25k, transfer her 401k there because she changed jobs. Absolutely no one other customers were in the bank. We were told that we need an appointment. An appointment to open a checking account. Wow. Not too long ago they would have opened an account without my premission."
"WFC dropped because the loan segment dropped a little. That's to be expected since the country isnt all back to work yet. Profits went up over 50%, that's what I'm focused on. The rest will fall into place over time. Well's is a great bank, they are fixing the mess and I'm adding the dips."
"Calm down and think again, settling a lawsuit is actually a good news....Mr Market sometimes makes mistakes, an intelligent investor knows how to exploit mistakes rather than making the same mistake as your neighbour Mr Market...."
Gets fined $250 million by regulators. Yet share prices rise 2% pre market. Makes no sense.
thank God she is not our president
January 4 $29.40 was a strong buy.
"Repost: 60HzEE 11 hours ago ""Five hours and thirty minutes to the statutory deadline, they bureaucrats propose a fine. And, where are the ""facts?"" Does the OCC have a list of customers that haven't been contacted? Where's the evidence? ""Unsatisfactory progress"" is poppycock. I would hope that Wells Fargo doesn't pay this and takes the OCC to federal court so that it will have to provide evidence, as in proof that ""unsatisfactory progress"" is somehow documented via individuals, by name, that deserved restitution; and that the bank had their proper contact information, yet failed to contact them over the last four years."""
WFC is up 4.91% to 47.53
This market is really bi-polar. Or the big boys are manipulating the short-term price to fleece panicky investors.

Warren must be investigated. She has caused far more harm to America and Americans than WFC could ever cause. Her policies have destroyed the economy and she is the embodiment of all that is wrong with America
"I am a big fan of WFC both as a long time customer and shareholder. But one thing they have done recently really puzzles me. I have a WFC credit card. I pay my balances off monthly automatically and I charge a fair amount so they make money on the merchant side. I have a very high credit score. I have a mortgage on an investment property with them that I have paid off almost 4 years early. I have multiple accounts and have been a customer for decades. But I get a letter about 2 months ago from them saying they won't let me keep my current credit card limit unless ""I spend $4,000 on my card within the next 2 months"". The funny thing is that I have a lot of cards and this one has one of the lower limits and I have never even been anywhere near the limit. But suddenly I have to spend $4K just to keep the same limit I have had for years with a spotless payment record? That seems very odd and just bad business. The kind of thing that makes long term customers says ""bye-bye""."
Old FOREX investigation results in the filing and settling of a lawsuit for 37 million. Buy the dip.

WFC$ reported net income of $5.1 billion ($1.17 a share) vs. $3.2 billion (70 cents a share) last year.
Nice bounce today. Market is down yet WFC is climbing. I expect 47 by Friday.
I'd love it if everyone would stop selling before we reach $50... yeah... thaaaanks
"This is classic political grandstanding by Warren. I won't be surprised to see the Dems start squawking about all their favorite bogeymen as we head into 2022 elections. They need to distract from The Hair-Plugged One's many calamities. Expect pharma to be a target, as well as banks, oil companies, and corporations in general. Covid will also be kept front and center. There will be no mentions of Afghanistan, the Mexican border, Cuba, or inflation. Warren will probably make WFC break-up her new mission in life. She misses the limelight."
"My thinking is WFC could of released a smooth statement, ""We are working diligently to make amends to our victims"" and it could of cut off much of today's bloodshed. ""No comment"" didn't seem to be the right answer."
wayyy undervalued
"As long as Janet Yellen is around, WFC will never see its asset cap removed!"
Why is the CEO not making a statement on this! Unbelievable.
This is setting up for a nice run back to the $47 - $50 range once the market is done shorting. The question is when.
JPM beats with solid Q3 numbers.
Did Wells create the financial crisis??
"The are buying back stock, cutting costs, P/E is 13, and rates can only go in one direction. BUY"
"Wells Fargo’s (NYSE: WFC) earnings release, scheduled for Thursday morning, is likely to be “amazing,” Cramer said. Wells Fargo’s quarterly report will not be “as bad as it used to be,” he added.Hmmmm. I hope he is right and knows something we don't."
Any predictions on what the stock will do tomorrow?
"Just to put a bug in some ears here, if you're looking for a play on higher interest rates without the political mingling here at Wells Fargo, check out Unum Group (UNM). Largest disability insurance provider in the U.S. ; 5% and rising dividend ; Forward PE < 5.0! Just moved from the S&P500 to the Midcap400 so has taken a hit its CHEAP."
"Just to be clear, I'm holding long until we reach $100/share. At that point, will review and likely hold and ultimately gift to family."
"WFC certainly is an interesting, objective case study. And any WFC investor should certainly KNOW what they own and research its history. For years ... WFC was a strong, stable, long-term investment with a good divy, and well-respected among Financials and the broader market. Little did folks know the culture that was was breeding within their branches. That culture of fraud 1st came to light in late 2016 when the fake acct fraud 1st surfaced. WFC stock dropped, then languished a bit. Wells promised they would ""make this right"". And the market largely forgave them, as the stock, and the broader markets, performed well through 2017 with WFC reaching all-time highs. Then ... it was discovered that the scope of the fraud was MUCH deeper than originally disclosed, up to 4 Million fake accts. Plus it was discovered that 27,000 auto loan customers were were force-placed additional insurance premiums, when they already had coverage documented with the WFC loss-payee clause. This caused many to default, late fees, and damaging credit reports with massive $$$ damage to borrowers. Add another mortgage scandal ... and WFC stock tanked in Feb 2018 when regulators finally in posed sanctions. New investors looking for a quick buck, again drove the price up a bit. That's when I finally bolted at 57+ in Sept. 2018 after being a 20 yr investor. As more details of these scandals emerged, the precipitous decline of WFC stock continued through 2019. This at a time when other banks and the broader market saw 20%, 30% gains and more. WFC lost and sdditional 20% plus! Then ... the Covid paranoia in 2020, with WFC falling harder & faster than the rest of the market. In 2021, with more promises from WFC and the Covid paranoia subsiding, WFC investors did recover some of their losses, as the stock outperformed, which was somewhat predictable. of course nice gains in other Financials & the S&P also! :-). NOW ... adter all the fines, settlements, and sanctions; its discovered that WFC is not completing their restitution and obligations as they promised. Sound familiar? Be careful with this stock folks! Many investors & retirees lost massive $$$ on WFC the past 5 yrs. With the recent discovery, and Charlie remaining mumm, it doesn't look good! Much safrer and better returns to be had elsewhere! Good luck!"
The stock can go up or down from here or stay where it is. My thought for the day. That said I am super duper bullish on Wells.
Clearly the recent action shows that recent regulatory action is being shrugged off. WFC should regain its footing in the $49-50 range prior to earnings… at that point be holding as many shares as you can.
BAC is at parity with WFC
Accelerated buy back will benefit WFC.
"Nice move today. My guess is the Q3-21 total shares outstanding number has found its way to The Street and it is far lower than expected, suggesting an aggressive/successful buyback campaign in Q3 as suggested by Senior Management. We shall see."
