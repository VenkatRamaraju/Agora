"Housing cyclicality &/or lack of business diversification risk? Wouldn't a truly flawless business have diversification yielding an element of counter cyclicality? Not argumentative ,just trying to pick your brain Tom.I do like the company's renewal /extension of SHRP authorization by $300mm esp as PPS is deciding on +/- the key $4000 area. Mgt clearly has faith. My technical focus assists scale up/scale down decisions as I love the idea of buy & forget a great business. For 4 years NVR has been in a big channel roughly between $2100-$4400ish. It's looking more & more likely that it wants to break to upside & make a LT move much higher."

"~$154M deployed on share repurchases with ~$550M remaining under the existing program. Given that the company has been conservative in deploying cash throughout the pandemic, this is acceptable to me.Nothing has changed with regard to my outlook on $NVR. I believe the shares will exceed $5,900 in 2021 and $8,900 by the end of 2022.Despite the tremendous risk that exists in the market, ultimately, value abounds."
Earnings avg estimate is 72.53 and low estimate is 61 for the quarter ending in June. Last quarter earnings was 63.1 so why is the price falling before the earning report? Any idea?

Everyone happy today ?!
"$NVR saw returns on invested capital decline by ~27.4% YoY in 2020. This reduction in ROIC can be explained by an increase of ~30% in current liabilities. It not a deterioration in efficiency, despite the added costs associated with doing business during a pandemic.Also, $NVR's ~25.37% decline in return on assets is directly attributed to the fact that assets increased ~51.44% YoY in 2020. It's a larger denominator, nothing more.I maintain a bullish disposition on $NVR. Folks have gotten so worked out about rates and have missed out on the gains in the market, including residential real estate, as a result. The fact is that rates remain low, as do taxes. This is a good environment for domestic equities. $AAPL $AMZN $NVR are three of my favorites."
Looking for this 2nd crash to get in on this . Little worried about ghost towns being built and no buyers .

Can anyone tell what’s going on with NVR for the last two weeks?
Did you see briefly in the AH’s we were up $744….scared my short shorts !! I shorted 40 shares at $5291.30…. Love this stock for its wild swings. But when I saw it up $744 at 40 shares short I almost shited my shorts !!
worst stock ever i had
What if we have an inflation? Is this dropping because interest rates might go up and less demand for real estate? I am just hoping in the long run I gain some profit because my portfolio is bleeding right now because of this stock.
buy X to gain 3 times if home builder stocks go up!

"$NVR really epitomizes my idea of a wonderful business. We’ve got abundant cash flow produced from core operating activities, an asset light model, robust demand for the product, conservative accounting practices (no goodwill) and most importantly, a management team willing to forego dividends, retain earnings and use free cash to repurchase aggressively. If you’ve got something that’s making you rich, why do you want to bring in additional partners? Why not keep the money for yourself? This is so fundamental to my investment philosophy.Lastly, I love that $NVR is taking on more debt. Why not raise as much capital as possible - makes perfect sense and I would love to see them raise a little more. Folks, that cash is going to straight to repurchases. You can get away with a more top heavy capital structure when you have a proven ability to produce cash flow from operations. It’s different than some other companies, where there’s cash coming in from assets sales. discontinued operations, cash flow from investing activities and other non-core sources. The low variance in $NVR’s operating cash flow helps to support its low WACC, which only further supports the case for borrowing."
NVR is up 5.29% to $2357.47
"Over the last 3 trading days the out flow has been out pacing inflow- 61-% to 39%.. on 9-13 there were 1923 medium to large size sells. Don’t panic, keep your powder dry and BUY BUY BUY !’ I picked up 169 shares at $4958.59 at the close."
"Since my last post, I've adjusted my price target to $5,900 per share. Analysts are too conservative and wrong about $NVR and the influence of the unprecedented action from the Fed. That said, my price target has many assumptions baked in including continued low rates through all of 2021, a Trump re-election and COVID resolution.This estimate includes revenues of around ~$8B, net income of ~$1B, around ~$750M spent on repurchases, a float of ~3.4M shares for EPS of around $295 per share next year.The company has unbelievably high ROA, ROE, ROIC all from a very balanced capital structure. Operating income and hence operating cash flow is the most important characteristic of any business in my view. It's $NVR's ability to continue to produce strong operating cash flow that enables it to repurchase so much stock and enrich existing shareholders by increasing their proportionate equity.I think I mentioned in a previous post that a high ROE really isn't that impressive for businesses with a lot of debt. You see, if a company carries a high amount of debt and has minimal equity, it means those few partners are exposed to a greater amount of risk - but - they can also potentially increase their equity faster, spread amongst fewer partners and therefore potentially generate higher returns on equity but not necessarily on invested capital or total capital which is a better measurement of operating performance."
"EPS of Q3 increased 25%, but price lower 10% than year ago :)"
Apparently even a great report isn't good enough... :-(
"Why doesn't this company and Paul Seville in particular, ever have earnings calls? There's a number of concerns investors should have about NVR. Yet, the only path to getting them answered is through investor relations. This is NOT acceptable in 2018 for a company the size of NVR."

NVR is up 11.33% to 3755.80
"30 year treasuries are yielding ~1.6% compared to ~3.5% in 2018 and ~5% in 2010. “Interest rate risk” as it pertains to home builders is overblown. The short end of the curve is at zero and the long end is essentially zero in real risk-free terms.I completely agree with the viewpoint that the vaccine will expedite a sell off on the long end of the curve and drive yields higher. But it’s not so precise; it’s not so precise that a few bps up or down actually affects a buyers disposition towards purchasing.Folks, newsflash, there is overwhelming demand for residential real estate. Average homebuyers don’t understand the time value of money or the yield curve. They just want their white picket fence for $500,000 and $NVR is building it for them."
