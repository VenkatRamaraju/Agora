is RYB the leader in this sector? does anyone know names of its competitors? we need to do some studies and find out if RYB can weather through this storm. price right now is so attractive...
"The public outrage triggered by the official investigation report on the red, yellow and blue child abuse incident in Beijing is on the ebb. Three more kindergartens in Hebei are punctured by their parents with needle sticks or toothpicks, including a red-yellow-blue kindergarten in Cangzhou, but many related videos Relevant information sent from parents was blocked.According to reports by Chinese media on the 29th, parents of Red, Yellow and Blue Kindergartens in Canal District of Cangzhou City, Hebei Province, reported to the police on 27 November that they said that there was a needle eye on their child and suspected that their child was infringed upon in the nursery. Kindergarten was temporarily closed after police alerted the police.Earlier, a parent of a suspected kindergarten child posted a message in the WeChat circle of friends saying: ""My son's diagnosis shows that punctate skin is damaged. Now four of our children in the same class have pin-pointed eyes ...""Another parent said, ""This is my son's hurt in the red, yellow and blue kindergarten. I have already reported it. I hope the kindergarten will give me an explanation."" Attached a few photos of children's acupuncture points and hospital diagnoses.There are parents, said: ""tuition a month 4,000 dollars! The best thought for the children, did not expect the child to be punished every day."""
Monday it will reach 12
could go south to 15s or 10s
Buy before this takes off....other preschools are even much worse than RYB. kids need to go to school! are there other better choices???
"We know they are lying, and they know they are lying, they even know we know it, we even know they know we know it, they even know we know they know we know it, but they still chose to do so."
"The Operating Income: 2014 LOSS (-3000); 2015 LOSS (-1000); But 2016 Suddenly Became Not NEGATIVE of $8000! It is fake on income or really made that money? IF really made that amount, what did they do in 2016 to get the unbelievable miracle operating increase?"
"http://www.wenxuecity.com/news/2017/12/26/6847681.htmlMr.Huang: what happened in kinderguard should be throught to be moral issues. In his opinion, the key here is not enough resource for child care. People have hard time to find good resources for their kids. what needed here is to improve and get more resources for kids.RYB after learning the lesson should do much better in all areas. I think this incident in the end could be good a turning point for them to improve its quality."
Time to buy!
This is a good time to load more....This sector is booming in China....
$16.33 a smart buy!premarket
GREAT BUYING OP...GREAT
"this quarter earning is very bad, but the revenue outlook for next quarter is good, so the share price will come back"
RYB reporting tonight at 4pm... Result should be good and this will go to $23+
"Yes, RYB is ready for take off . . . look at today's great price action, on heavy volume. Appears all the bad old news is already priced in; now ready to re-take its IPO price, then higher."
great buy now
"Aunty Em . . . Where do I begin?

earnings does not matter. company reputation at stake and next quarter parents will stop sending to this school. so it will not have similar report next quarter
The value of this company is 0 now if not negative. The extend of damage can be compared to the fake milk event 10 years ago. The entire Chinese dairy industry was basically wiped out and still far from being recovered.
any news？
"RYB Education responded yesterday, saying the company has provided documents and surveillance footage to police, and that the teachers allegedly involved have been suspended.The company also told police it has been falsely accused and framed by some people. This statement from the company. Be careful shorting as this story could go a completely another way."
"Child abuse scandal in one of the sites in beijing，kids under the age of six are reportedly to have been sexually abused ，drugged and injected with needles. Police are involved, wish they have child protection service as in US..."
"PE Ratio (TTM) 55.01 too high. 16.56s, should be 0.5$/s"
Yahoo finance reported the news just now
Let’s short this. Shame on RYB!
"Should buy RYB asap now, Hold it higher and higher, and BUY !"
do we short the adr?
$12 bucks near future? will wait 2 see option activity for some direction
http://www.businessinsider.com/r-chinas-ryb-education-fires-head-of-beijing-kindergarten-embroiled-in-abuse-scandal-2017-11
Chinese government just announced that public companies are not allowed to run education business. Might be the reason.
this stock will crash on Friday
Stock halted ? Not moving.
Let’s sell ryb to the hell
"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to China. For those who do not know, China has changed there one child per family policy. Now you may have 2. Many Chinese now make more money and millions of couples are currently trying for a second child. All this screams long-term buy for RYB. I also have a 3year old daughter myself and hope any wrong doing is punished swiftly and hardly. The company as a whole though has a growing market and string fundamentals."
The police report triggered people's anger. There is no logic that more than 10 parents report rumors to the police at the same time. The hard drive of the monitoring system is conveniently broken. They paid high fees to get in this kindergarden.
"sometimes, investors came here for a quick profit, may not for the young kids."
"despite of the abuse issue. i do think RYB future is promising in longterm because if you have done the investigation on the china pre-school marketing, you will find it hard to get so called ""permission"" to set up one school, and it almost was somehow monopolized by someone with strong connection with government."
Public trust is the key for this company’s future. Not sure it can regain the trust or not. An early education company has to expand very slowly and carefully not to have scandals like this.
market open and this will be slaughtered
Does anybody has the information about RYB's short interest and percentage?
"What is interesting here is that investors outside China put money into a company inside China and they have no reliable information other than third party or forth party info, PRs, etc.At this price range, it is not worth the risk."
Today had no enough stock to short and just ran for half day. Monday will drop another $10.00 or maybe direct sit on $2.00 chair!
"We came from beijing , China. That problem was already solved , only one person had responsibility, small thing. We believe RYB is a good company, RYB is going to bounce UP to $25.00+ soon !Shold buy asap at this point and Hold it higher !"
16.5 soon and if that's broken it will move to 14
Punishing a student with a ruler hitting on his hand is very common thing in China school
Please short this stock！！
Do u think China Gov let this company alive? Deal or Jail? Wait and See !
Cost was high because it went to public last year. I think the business is doing well. I believe the price will go up for sure.
"After the storm, the sun always rises again, after all."
"No direct evidence of child abuse is released(video footage, records, etc), just some words from furious parents and biased media. It’ll go up soon, just bought some shares before close"
who is tracking the 50MM USD buyback plan? institutions moves?
"I think ER showed good growth for a small cap stock, but not at a very exciting rate..."
"Have you looked at number of law firms shouting until blue trying to get people to join their class action lawsuit!Anytime RYB comes out with good news, they innundate news wire with lawsuit enlistment announcement! Odds are pretty good lawsuit will mount to not much and will profit law firms handsomely at existing shareholders. Those who lost m,oney will only get fraction of their loses if they get any at all!GLTA in stock casino!"
"Is there a link of their investor concall manuscript? The Chinese media reported that the RYB called it ""turmoil"" and ""isolated incident""druing the conference..., the third isolated incident in two years, I guess..."
I bought big today. I do not think the RYB have any big wrong in this case. One employee did wrong things not means the company's policy is wrong. All the lawsuits are very common things when the company stock downing big. And mostly time it just goes away if nothing is wrong. Also the report came out yesterday and it looks very good too. The business of RYB is only going good in the future based on the new chinese fertility policy and chinese economy getting better & stronger. Holding your shares you will appreciate.
Scandal of sexual harassment on children exposed..be cautious
"So, is there any one shorted this stock in the name of “protect the children”"
"I read through posts in this board. I dont think those bad news or rumors will hurt RYB badly. It is China. Message are not freely spread. When government said RYB is good, it is good. Obviously government is on RYB side. It is totally different from QD. It does not matter what you think. It is not USA."
"rumor is RYB is backed by a very powerful and corrupt government official. they are now starting to silence all public commenting of RBY in China. and RYB released statement including threat to go after parents who ""vilified "" RYB ""without cause or evidence."" the timing of RYB is so perfectly timed with these events. good luck to longs! congrats shorts!"
"Keep Green, good job"
Anyone knows what happened?
"If you're able to short this stock, don't miss this chance because of what they did, sexual assault, to only 3-year old kids in their kindergarten in the capital of China"
This will go up tomorrow too
"25% held by insiders, now consider this. There is pretty much uncertainty right now, but what if the new regulation will only prevent new entries into the market`?"
Shorts will start covering when it breaks through $8 and it will pop fast.
"Has been all over the news regarding the child abuse from one of these centres in Beijing. Children refused to go to school because they ""didn't want to take medicine when they aren't sick."" School refuses to release surveillance footage. Thumbs down."
Ryb seems ready take off
"Perhaps, this one will go back $30.00 after the scandal. Not comfortable to short it... Hopefully, im wrong."
The company spent over 50 million on buying back. Short now.
MMs jumped in and pushed the stock back up in the past two days...this is a good news!
"RYB is going to rise UP fast coming ! Hold it higher and higher, and Buy asap !"
"Second Quarter 2018 Operational and Financial Summary• Number of students enrolled at RYB directly operated kindergartens was 23,526 as of June 30, 2018, a 15.0% increase from 20,463 as of June 30, 2017.• Number of franchise play-and-learn centers and kindergartens in operation were 1,029 and 216, respectively, as of June 30, 2018.• Net revenues increased by 25.6% to $47.5 million, compared with $37.8 million for the second quarter of 2017.• Gross profit was $15.9 million, compared with $9.4 million for the second quarter of 2017.• Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for the second quarter of 2018 was $4.7 million, compared with $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders1 of RYB for the second quarter of 2018 was $6.9 million, compared with $4.5 million for the second quarter of 2017.• Net cash outflows from operating activities were $10.6 million in the second quarter of 2018.Balance Sheet: As of June 30, 2018, the Company had total cash, cash equivalents and term deposits of $143.0 million, compared with $158.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash balance was primarily driven by operational cash outflow, capital expenditures of $2.4 million and acquisition payments of $2.3 million in the quarter.Cash $143 million Vs Market Cap $228 millionThis opportunity you will hard to see in the market"
"For us, RYB is just an investment stock. when the problem exposed, the company held the perpetrators accountable and acted promptly on their part. they are just a company. what else could they do? if you hate Chinese government, there is right way to do that, but not punish a company and its shareholders. we have nothing to do with it."
Why drop so much today?
Why is RYBeye down this AM?
"if nothing big happens, I guess ryb will go up big time."
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42105443
When is the earning? I think RYB will have a good earning. It is said that for enrollment one has to apply one year in advance. The demand is big.
Nice job everyone who had the chance to short it.
What’s happening??
like Sanlu
"updated news from Beijing regarding RYB, 2 suspects has been arrested for fabricating the child abuse case and spreading through the net."
It's said there's another needle case reported at a different location.
Did Yeshiva's and Catholic Schools in US close....NOOOOO
"RYB will likely fall to lower teens, and possibly file for a bankruptcy in 2018 as its reputation and business continue to deteriorate."
ER out yet?
BEDU down 16%. RYB down 54%. RYB will bounce back up.
The police arrested several officials from the education authority in charge of reported ryb kindergarten in Beijing Chaoyang.
Buy at open. Watch shorts line up to exit. Squeeze 16-17-18. Exit. Watch it fade. Done for the day. Thank you
RYB Education is up 10.71% to 3.10
http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/2122301/ryb-education-shares-were-being-shorted-even-beijing-child
RYB targets at high-end customers and charges expensively. Its reputation and brand have been ruined. So its stock price will continue to go down.
BEDU is climbing a bit so already old news. RYB will climb back up also. Over sold.
"RYB preschools and kindergarten are primarily for kids from rich families. if they are really bad and systemically abuse kids, how could they grow so fast?"
RYB BAGHOLDERS LOST MONEY!       
going to 12
"Many individual investors were incited to short this last Friday, so 16-17 should be their cost and probably that’s what they want."
earnings does matter. that's why q4 will be a problem because parents are telling each other. blocking messages by the government in China means something fishy. Otherwise they will just respond instead of blocking.
This stock is just weird to me—can’t get its rhythm at all.
Forces Awakening!
Short this mdfk
I just visited RYB school . You cant tell any differdnce. Budiness not affected at all.
ER tomorrow after market close?
Order & discipline have been placed. Business growth is solid. $23 is imminent
timing to short
"I talked with my friends in China about preschools...the most important thing for parents is quality of the early education, not babysitting . RYB is clearly the leader in early education. so Parents will most likely still send their kids there."
ryb another location (Han dan city ) occurred the same thing in beijing
Shame on RYB
"This caused massive angry. Now, China Police, Department of Education, Women's Federation, City of Beijing Government, etc. already starting for investigation. With many evidences as kids said and found on their bodies in China media, I highly concern this company will still have a credibility and getting government authorization to keep its license for continue to do the business in China.Let's say, in very rare chance, maybe it secure its license. But it will immediately face two problems. 1) Lost Credibility. Parents will seriously lost confidence to pay top dollars to have children send to the company; 2) large & many lawsuits and class lawsuits will be filed in Both China and Unites States courts for justice. If so, the revenue will drop down to the floor, the expense will go to the roof. What kind result will be, you can imagination, I will watch!"
@Emma are you an IPO shareholder?
"It was reported some government officials in charge of education were being investigated for the RYB incident. It is kind of fishy here: if RYB is innocent, what are the government officials being investigated for?"
I think this will drop by 60%
Let’s short this mxxxxxxfxxxxx
"and THOR, don't count on Meuller. He didn't get anything. And Flynn case is probably going to be dismissed because he was interviewed by some PREVIOUS FBI agent."
"just saw a needle in the chart going up to 11.26, was this a message`?"
"This stock was manipulated by some shorts. The news was leaked out on Thanksgiving day for one individual case at one school ( they have near 100 school). The news was spread on social network, and hit on the day after Thanksgiving days. It is just tactics to maximize the price move. I have seen the similar thing before, but for now days, the social network makes much big impact. I bought on that day and sold after two days bounces. I will do the same today. Forget the news, do the research yourself to make your own judgment."
"$RYB is involved in sexually abusing kids by drugging them, taking off their clothes and selling them to male adults for molestation. It is under police investigation."
"and RYB has claimed officially that it will go to police for any ""framing"". sure it would try desperately to cover things up."
I bought some today and will buy more for sure!
"Education is a good sector. Will RYB go up?加入微信讨论群：To join the Chinese Investor Group, please add WeChat ID: ChinaInvestorGroup"
RYB now is public enemy
This Week's Top Gainers in U.S. Stocks https://stockreport.tips/Top-Market-Gainers
some explanation... https://twitter.com/readkrystalhu/status/1063088759724564481
this Will drop atleast 50%
RYB in Chengdu was reported
Here we go!! (up)
"it should be time for this one to recover some. no reason to continuely decrease.child education is a very promising area in China,especially for one child family. the incidents happened for the one school of RYB should be independent and shouldn't be thought to a common issue. I believe most people in China understand this and won't affect by the incident. I am not sure what kind of business has better potentials and future than what RYB is doing now. Giving some time, this one should take off. good time to accumulation."
Back to IPO price of 18.5!GLTA in stock casino!
"They issued a statement where they say they will ""continue their best practices"". Lol, this goes to $10 today."
I deem it will revive to 20
Last chance shorts. Buy to cover with ECN or get burn to the ground.
"REPORT RYBB SAID A SECOND RYB KINDERGARDEN WAS FORCE TO SHUT DOWN.CHINA MAJOR POLICE FORCE DETAIN DETAIN A TEACHER FOR USING NEEDLIES TO PUNISH CHILDREN FOR DESCIPLINE CHILDREN ANOTHER REPORT NORTH OF BEJING IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCE HEBEI CLOSE TO BEJING, AUTHOTIES THERE ARE INVESTIGATING AN ALLEGATION OF CHILD ABUSE HAVE TEMPORY CLOSED THERYB KINDERGARDEN SCHOOL, NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR RYB, LOK OUT BELOW HERECOMESANOTHERSCARY SCARY CRASH CRASHBELOW $13 TODAY"
several lawsuits have been brought up against ryb including Pomerantz and Rosen. Pomerantz has 80+ years in this business and Rosen is the no.2 to settle the equity class action cases in the country. the cash ryb is holding is probably not enough to cover the lawsuits cost.
"look at the volume, only 2.5m shares changed hand so far, that means no much seller or sorter now. The stock will back to normal range $25-30 on its way."
also balance cash is at $158.7m comparing $178.4m at Q3
Why it’s dropping so quick again?
What happened to Index? landsliding
"The teacher was arrested. More supply in the market is to come. That means, more competitors without bad news and bad history will be in the market."
"in a red day, RYB is green"
Animals! http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42105443
shorting it to death.
"Latest official report released, saying: no sexual abuse, most of them are rumors fabricated by journalists or some parents....."
"Anyone know why the price goes down? The report is good, no?"
The whole thing was fake news?
"the revenue growth is very slow, and the cost is going higher. The profit is down comparing with Q3 2017. That is why the stock is going down"
Financial fundamentals have not changed. This is a below 20buy. I do hope any wrong doings are punished swiftly and fairly as I have a 3year old daughter myself.
This is a $30 stock. i think it will rise up fast very soon.
The needle thing was last year wasn't it?
RYB is down -5.74% to 16.26
Buy asap ! Buy as much as possible !Only way is UP fast coming ! Buy and Hold !
"ONE THING ABOUT ALL CHINESE PARENTS LOOK AT CHILD SCHOOOL REPUTUTION VERY VERY IMPORTANT,ONCE THE CHILD SCHOOL HAS AVERY VERY BAD REPUTITION ,THEY WILL PULL THIER CHILDREN SO SO SO FAST , TO THECHINESE PARENTS IT ALL ABOUT WHICH SCHOOL YOUR CHILD GOES TO IN CHINA ,AND IF IT IS A BAD REPUTTION SCHOOL ,THEY WIL NOT HESTATE TO PULLTHIER KID OUTHE SAME WEEK OR MONTH, I SEE A HUGEHUGE DROP IN ENROLMENT IN Q4 IN RYB"
"A good comparison is the ""toxic milk"" scandle about 10 years ago. It basically wiped out the entire Chinese dairy industry. Chinese still don't buy local brand dairy products now, particular those for kids such as formula. They only trust imports as long as they can afford. The damage is very long termed if not permanent. Similarly, RYB is very likely to be bankrupted by the current scandal. When coming to kids, Chinese people can be extremely serious"
http://shanghaiist.com/2017/11/24/beijing-kindergarten-scandal.php
This kind news is 10-20% drop of maximum!
one child was found to have more than 50 needle marks.
I chatted with one of my workers who had lived in Shanghai before. this business is booming. high end preschool and kindergarten are highly demanded. tuition is around $1000 TO $1600 per month in Beijing and Shanghai. waiting list is super long and kids need to wait for more than a year to get in.
It is reported today one of the center in Beijing regularly drug and inject kids and invite a group of adult to sexually abuse the kids. The person who brought in the adult is the center directed/owners husband. Many parents reporting finding needle point marks on kids. Some kids abused ended up in emergency room. This is how it was discovered. The news n social media posts are being deleted or blocked.
This should see a nice boost soon I think $7.50-10!
"BELIEVE ME ONCE A SCHOOL HAS A BADBAD REPUTITION THE CHINESE PARENT WILPULL THIERCHILD OUT SO SOSO FAST FROM DAY TO WEEKS TO AMONTH, WHEN IT COME TO ALL CHINESE PARENTS IS ABOUT WHICH PRESTAGE SCHOOL YOUR CHILD GOES TO THAT IS INCLUDING KINDERGARDEN SCHOOL ,MORE SO CHINA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD , TO THECHINESE PARENTS IT ISABOUT WHIC PRETAGE SCHOOL YOU GO TO IN CHINA , AND IFTHE SCHOOLL HAS AVERY VERY BAD REPUTITIONMTHECHILD WILL BE PULLED OUTQUICKER THEN YOU BLINK AN EYE , THIS IS WHY I SEE HUGEHUGEDROP IN ENROLLMENTIN RYB IN Q4"
