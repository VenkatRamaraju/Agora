It's said there's another needle case reported at a different location.
What happened to Index? landsliding
Nice job everyone who had the chance to short it.
"just saw a needle in the chart going up to 11.26, was this a message`?"
RYB is up 6.63% to 21.07
"In China, it is ok for parents and teacher discipline kids by punishment. It is Chinese culture."
$187.4million cash
looks like this will b trading sub $16
"Emma, dahlin', y'alls don't know that the Trumpster's bank statements from Deutsche Bank were just nabbed by Meuller. Take it from a retired IRS SEP Agent (Special Enforcement Agent . . . we work fraud/money laundering/overseas accounts evasion cases) . . . It's over for the Trump crime family (cannot believe he STILL doesn't know it; Ty Cobb sure does (erstwhile brilliant criminal defense attorney)."
Ryb seems ready take off
Last chance shorts. Buy to cover with ECN or get burn to the ground.
RYB is down 32.31% to $11.27
16.5 soon and if that's broken it will move to 14
with 50% drop also it's not a big. looks like the news is all over the place
big sell of bearish technical triggered looking sub $14 to $12
"sometimes, investors came here for a quick profit, may not for the young kids."
"For us, RYB is just an investment stock. when the problem exposed, the company held the perpetrators accountable and acted promptly on their part. they are just a company. what else could they do? if you hate Chinese government, there is right way to do that, but not punish a company and its shareholders. we have nothing to do with it."
Here is the crux of the issue. What will happen to the bottom line? Will families pull away from enrolling? Will enough families pull away to make a noticeable difference? Only time can tell. Until then it is just soft core opinions and sentiments.
Lots of shorts will be covering soon.................didn’t turn out how they hoped which was to keep free falling. Especially if they bought today and it pops up to $10 tomorrow
"wow, lost money immediately. set another buy @16.5"
set @$17.4 to buy
ROKU tomorrow. there's things are easy...
"rumor is RYB is backed by a very powerful and corrupt government official. they are now starting to silence all public commenting of RBY in China. and RYB released statement including threat to go after parents who ""vilified "" RYB ""without cause or evidence."" the timing of RYB is so perfectly timed with these events. good luck to longs! congrats shorts!"
RYB is down -6.06% to 20.61
Scandal of sexual harassment on children exposed..be cautious
BEDU down 16%. RYB down 54%. RYB will bounce back up.
"Anyone know why the price goes down? The report is good, no?"
Too many people tried to jump in and short today between 7-8 so they will be forced to cover when this pops above $8.
"This news definitely will hurt RYB daycare brand in China.Official Reports:2015 RYB JiLIn 4 teachers arrested for Child Abuse2017 RYB BeiJing （大红门） Child Abuse, one Teacher and the head teacher was fired2017 RYB Beijing this Thanksgiving Bejing Daycae Child Abuse. One teacher was arrestedUnofficial Report:2017 Nov 27th Hebei Child Abuse 2 teachers arrested (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H2WeYrTDL4）;"
good time to buy more
one child was found to have more than 50 needle marks.
"Can anyone tell me how a single 22 year old female teacher feeds drug, pricks and sexually abuses kids in group???If you guys think it is OK to make money from this company, then don't complain if one day your kids get molested. Because it is you who funds people to do this #$%$. What goes around comes around."
Anyone knows what happened?
RYB in Chengdu was reported
"If ppl in China think the school is ok, I wonder why they don’t back up the truck!"
"They issued a statement where they say they will ""continue their best practices"". Lol, this goes to $10 today."
I have a feeling RYB will see a pullback now. What yall think? google awe-someSTOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
I shorted the stock but was told this stock is hard to borrow.

"$RYB is involved in sexually abusing kids by drugging them, taking off their clothes and selling them to male adults for molestation. It is under police investigation."
I deem it will revive to 20
is RYB the leader in this sector? does anyone know names of its competitors? we need to do some studies and find out if RYB can weather through this storm. price right now is so attractive...
"The teacher was arrested. More supply in the market is to come. That means, more competitors without bad news and bad history will be in the market."
Let’s short this. Shame on RYB!
"updated news from Beijing regarding RYB, 2 suspects has been arrested for fabricating the child abuse case and spreading through the net."
RYB is up 5.54% to 21.45
Is this still good short?.....
http://www.backchina.com/news/2017/11/25/529366.html
"I read through posts in this board. I dont think those bad news or rumors will hurt RYB badly. It is China. Message are not freely spread. When government said RYB is good, it is good. Obviously government is on RYB side. It is totally different from QD. It does not matter what you think. It is not USA."
It is overreact===life-time chance to buy bargain!
"RYB will likely fall to lower teens, and possibly file for a bankruptcy in 2018 as its reputation and business continue to deteriorate."
"Child abuse scandal in one of the sites in beijing，kids under the age of six are reportedly to have been sexually abused ，drugged and injected with needles. Police are involved, wish they have child protection service as in US..."
"I know this firm very well with its cutting-edge management team. They know what to do. This is an individual case and not a financial accounting issue. Why do you react to a such headline news? if you do, you are doomed to fail in your stock operating."
any news？
RYB reached an all time low at $5.60
RYB is down -10.67% to 19.25
this Will drop atleast 50%
Not a buy
"Is there a link of their investor concall manuscript? The Chinese media reported that the RYB called it ""turmoil"" and ""isolated incident""druing the conference..., the third isolated incident in two years, I guess..."
timing to short
"What is interesting here is that investors outside China put money into a company inside China and they have no reliable information other than third party or forth party info, PRs, etc.At this price range, it is not worth the risk."
great buy now
"25% held by insiders, now consider this. There is pretty much uncertainty right now, but what if the new regulation will only prevent new entries into the market`?"
"It was reported some government officials in charge of education were being investigated for the RYB incident. It is kind of fishy here: if RYB is innocent, what are the government officials being investigated for?"
Punishing a student with a ruler hitting on his hand is very common thing in China school

"No direct evidence of child abuse is released(video footage, records, etc), just some words from furious parents and biased media. It’ll go up soon, just bought some shares before close"
"class action law suits were filed by a couple of law firms in the name of the investors, all should have got emails or mails about the case"
huge increase in enrollment numbers ...looking nice!
"After the storm, the sun always rises again, after all."
Buy at open. Watch shorts line up to exit. Squeeze 16-17-18. Exit. Watch it fade. Done for the day. Thank you
earnings does not matter. company reputation at stake and next quarter parents will stop sending to this school. so it will not have similar report next quarter
This will go up tomorrow too
Don’t bother guys. Kindergarten already apologized and polices has already obtained the evidence. Don’t expect this to come back any time soon. Child Abuse stock should never come back.
RYB targets at high-end customers and charges expensively. Its reputation and brand have been ruined. So its stock price will continue to go down.
Back to IPO price of 18.5!GLTA in stock casino!
What’s happening??
RYB is down -5.74% to 16.26
RYB is down -5.42% to 21.03
When is the earning? I think RYB will have a good earning. It is said that for enrollment one has to apply one year in advance. The demand is big.

"What is a 'Short Interest'A short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out. Short interest is a market-sentiment indicator that tells whether investors think a stock's price is likely to fall. It can also be compared over time to examine changes in investor sentiment. BREAKING DOWN 'Short Interest'Investors use short interest to make predictions about the direction a particular stock is headed, and to measure the bullishness or bearishness of investors' sentiment toward the market as a whole. Short interest can be expressed as a percentage by dividing the number of shares sold short by the total number of outstanding shares. For example, 3% short interest means 3% of the outstanding shares are held short. Short interest can be expressed as the number of shares sold short but not yet covered or closed out. Short interest data is widely and easily available online.Short interest for individual stocks is updated monthly. The short interest is a combination of shares sold short by individuals, professionals and institutions including market makers and specialists. When the short interest for a stock rises above 25%, it may be a warning sign that sentiment is growing negative on the company. Stocks with short interest above 40% are highly susceptible to potential short squeezes. Stocks with smaller floats and high short interest have the highest danger of short squeezing as shortable shares become scarcer more quickly.Short Interest and Short SqueezesA short squeeze forms when short sellers are forced to cover some or all of their positions by buying back the shares. Usually a short squeeze ignites on a large price, and volume spikes sparked by news or rumors. The unavailability of additional short shares traps the existing short sellers, causing forced liquidations from margin calls, which sets off another wave of buying to cover short positions. Oftentimes, individual brokers may also raise the maintenance margin requirements on these stocks, which forces more short sellers to downsize their positions. This pushes the stock price even higher as more desperate short sellers panic trying to cover.This cycle repeats itself until the stock finally peaks out and exhausts. Predicting where a short squeeze will finally conclude is a futile endeavor. Fundamental news items such as strong earnings reports and raised guidance, FDA approvals, successful clinical trials, outside investments, partnerships/joint ventures with larger peer companies, successful court rulings, patent news and analyst upgrades can fuel a short squeeze. Takeover rumors and speculation are also notorious for sparking a short squeeze."
Time to buy!

"There has been too much capital eyeing on China preschool education, a rule setting would be a positive guideline to cool down the furious competition, opportunities are huge"
"The stock price will go to zero, cuz no one in china dare to send their child to the hell ryb kindergarten."
RYB Education is down 10.36% to 3.46
Why it’s dropping so quick again?
I chatted with one of my workers who had lived in Shanghai before. this business is booming. high end preschool and kindergarten are highly demanded. tuition is around $1000 TO $1600 per month in Beijing and Shanghai. waiting list is super long and kids need to wait for more than a year to get in.
"I think ER showed good growth for a small cap stock, but not at a very exciting rate..."
Short this mdfk
Google it ... children were abused with needles
Monday it will reach 12
Did Yeshiva's and Catholic Schools in US close....NOOOOO
This is a $30 stock. i think it will rise up fast very soon.
New incident reported on 12/26. Parent filed police report on allegedly needling of son by Head of a RYB kindergarten in Chengdu. Surveillance video deleted. Hard drive now with local police.
"the revenue growth is very slow, and the cost is going higher. The profit is down comparing with Q3 2017. That is why the stock is going down"
MMs jumped in and pushed the stock back up in the past two days...this is a good news!

This Week's Top Gainers in U.S. Stocks https://stockreport.tips/Top-Market-Gainers
The company spent over 50 million on buying back. Short now.
"ONE THING ABOUT ALL CHINESE PARENTS LOOK AT CHILD SCHOOOL REPUTUTION VERY VERY IMPORTANT,ONCE THE CHILD SCHOOL HAS AVERY VERY BAD REPUTITION ,THEY WILL PULL THIER CHILDREN SO SO SO FAST , TO THECHINESE PARENTS IT ALL ABOUT WHICH SCHOOL YOUR CHILD GOES TO IN CHINA ,AND IF IT IS A BAD REPUTTION SCHOOL ,THEY WIL NOT HESTATE TO PULLTHIER KID OUTHE SAME WEEK OR MONTH, I SEE A HUGEHUGE DROP IN ENROLMENT IN Q4 IN RYB"
I wonder how much they paid for the PR and police. Or how badly the Chinese gov wants to cover this. We just want to know the truth! Who invest this company be human first then think about making money! !
trading stock is the way someone lost big and someone made big. I expect holding ones i bought today and sell it less in one month at 30% gain
RYB is down -5.81% to 20.12
"Police also arrested another woman, also surnamed Liu, on suspicion of spreading “unconfirmed and illegal facts”, a catch-all euphemism that include everything from spreading rumours to disseminating information the authorities deem unfavourable. The 31-year-old has already expressed “deep regret”, according to a police statement."
"It seems to me some people are very eager to tell the story RYB will go crash tomorrow. After two days of police investigation, there still no official evidence of any crime committed by any person, only rumors competing to make the social medias more excited. The original rumor includes some of the most no-common-sense stories, like a three year old child told her parents ""uncle doctors"" did check up on her body. Really? how can a three year old knows the concept of doctor and check up? and another story is "" a group of children are forced to watch uncles having sex with children in a dark room"", etc. which make it so similar to Japanese AV film craps. However, some Chinese people are not looking for the facts, what they want is to make a short sale opportunity for themselves."
BEDU on the same boat.
shorting it to death.
Financial fundamentals have not changed. This is a below 20buy. I do hope any wrong doings are punished swiftly and fairly as I have a 3year old daughter myself.
"I talked with my friends in China about preschools...the most important thing for parents is quality of the early education, not babysitting . RYB is clearly the leader in early education. so Parents will most likely still send their kids there."
RYB Education is up 10.52% to 3.86
Anyone know why is going up?
talked to the lawyers...sure case sounds like
"We know they are lying, and they know they are lying, they even know we know it, we even know they know we know it, they even know we know they know we know it, but they still chose to do so."
"Me I think ryb will be much higher in a few years, patience will pay."
RYB is down -5.60% to 20.31
Anyone know what is going on here? Only gov Policy changing? By the way I bought in big today
could go south to 15s or 10s
RYB reached a new All Time Low at $11.35
Why is RYBeye down this AM?
ryb another location (Han dan city ) occurred the same thing in beijing
"BELIEVE ME ONCE A SCHOOL HAS A BADBAD REPUTITION THE CHINESE PARENT WILPULL THIERCHILD OUT SO SOSO FAST FROM DAY TO WEEKS TO AMONTH, WHEN IT COME TO ALL CHINESE PARENTS IS ABOUT WHICH PRESTAGE SCHOOL YOUR CHILD GOES TO THAT IS INCLUDING KINDERGARDEN SCHOOL ,MORE SO CHINA THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD , TO THECHINESE PARENTS IT ISABOUT WHIC PRETAGE SCHOOL YOU GO TO IN CHINA , AND IFTHE SCHOOLL HAS AVERY VERY BAD REPUTITIONMTHECHILD WILL BE PULLED OUTQUICKER THEN YOU BLINK AN EYE , THIS IS WHY I SEE HUGEHUGEDROP IN ENROLLMENTIN RYB IN Q4"
"and RYB has claimed officially that it will go to police for any ""framing"". sure it would try desperately to cover things up."
Yahoo finance reported the news just now
RYB is down -5.66% to 20.02
I bought some today and will buy more for sure!
The value of this company is 0 now if not negative. The extend of damage can be compared to the fake milk event 10 years ago. The entire Chinese dairy industry was basically wiped out and still far from being recovered.
"if nothing big happens, I guess ryb will go up big time."
I just visited RYB school . You cant tell any differdnce. Budiness not affected at all.
This stock wants to break out today. but MMs are controlling the price to accumulate if you see the chart. I don't like this company but I wouldn't short without hedging or leaving it over night. too risky
This company probably abusing children for a long time.should never go on ipo.now they steal your money and run
who checked if the buyback 50MM USD runs out or not. got public at the end of Sept. and only 25% shares floating out there. not much liquidity anyways.
GREAT BUYING OP...GREAT
Buy 300 shares today and make $1200 by 1pm
Does anybody has the information about RYB's short interest and percentage?
"By the way, what's wrong with you Yahoo Finance? Can't do simple math?7.83-8.82 (-52.97%)At close: 3:59PM EST7.82 -5.39 (-32.37%)After hours: 4:30PM EST"
"it should be time for this one to recover some. no reason to continuely decrease.child education is a very promising area in China,especially for one child family. the incidents happened for the one school of RYB should be independent and shouldn't be thought to a common issue. I believe most people in China understand this and won't affect by the incident. I am not sure what kind of business has better potentials and future than what RYB is doing now. Giving some time, this one should take off. good time to accumulation."
it will break 16.5
The police report triggered people's anger. There is no logic that more than 10 parents report rumors to the police at the same time. The hard drive of the monitoring system is conveniently broken. They paid high fees to get in this kindergarden.
$16.33 a smart buy!premarket
market open and this will be slaughtered

"with the Chinese parents reputation is very very important to Chinese parents in which school they send thier children . and if a school that has a very very bad reputition ,they wil not hesitate to pull their children out of that school and transfer thierchildren to another school other than ryb , with child abuse situation and on going investigation on teachers and school could see enrollment going down in q 4 and parents pulling their children out of ryb"

Cost was high because it went to public last year. I think the business is doing well. I believe the price will go up for sure.
"People, please short this stock. What happened at Beijing RYB is not isolated case. RYB daycare was accused for child abuse at different locations across different cities in China. Yesterday, there was other incident In Hebei China, parents found kids was abused by needles. RYB quickly removed all related videos and news reports from Chinese Media and on line. But you can still find the video from youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H2WeYrTDL4Please saving the kids from this organization. Don't put your money to help them to abuse more kids!"
do we short the adr?
The world has become a mess and the bottom might drop out in the markets.
"Yes, you can buy this stock to make money. This money is very dirty and you are making it from the youths. It is the same things as blood diamond"
RYB now is public enemy
There are a lot of shooters here..Stock looks promising from all that I've read..1500 employees and possible a very few employees if guilty..Company says it is a lie..
"The public outrage triggered by the official investigation report on the red, yellow and blue child abuse incident in Beijing is on the ebb. Three more kindergartens in Hebei are punctured by their parents with needle sticks or toothpicks, including a red-yellow-blue kindergarten in Cangzhou, but many related videos Relevant information sent from parents was blocked.According to reports by Chinese media on the 29th, parents of Red, Yellow and Blue Kindergartens in Canal District of Cangzhou City, Hebei Province, reported to the police on 27 November that they said that there was a needle eye on their child and suspected that their child was infringed upon in the nursery. Kindergarten was temporarily closed after police alerted the police.Earlier, a parent of a suspected kindergarten child posted a message in the WeChat circle of friends saying: ""My son's diagnosis shows that punctate skin is damaged. Now four of our children in the same class have pin-pointed eyes ...""Another parent said, ""This is my son's hurt in the red, yellow and blue kindergarten. I have already reported it. I hope the kindergarten will give me an explanation."" Attached a few photos of children's acupuncture points and hospital diagnoses.There are parents, said: ""tuition a month 4,000 dollars! The best thought for the children, did not expect the child to be punished every day."""
BEDU is climbing a bit so already old news. RYB will climb back up also. Over sold.
Doing research on new stocks is getting so hard. That’s why I joined up with this free service that sends one solid stock pick every single week. So far the picks have been great. Just go to https://getstockdorks.blogspot.com/ to learn more. .

it was not short. it's simply sold
"This stock was manipulated by some shorts. The news was leaked out on Thanksgiving day for one individual case at one school ( they have near 100 school). The news was spread on social network, and hit on the day after Thanksgiving days. It is just tactics to maximize the price move. I have seen the similar thing before, but for now days, the social network makes much big impact. I bought on that day and sold after two days bounces. I will do the same today. Forget the news, do the research yourself to make your own judgment."
News: China to provide more affordable preschool edu in a few yrs
like Sanlu
Down 18% like BEDU brings us to $12 plus. Nice!! Buy buy.
RYB is down -5.29% to 21.50
"Policy has stated even tho RYB already public, from now on, the money RYB get from Stock market can no longer be used on their primary business, which is kindergarten. So i dont see this coming back any time soon."
ER out yet?
"http://www.wenxuecity.com/news/2017/12/26/6847681.htmlMr.Huang: what happened in kinderguard should be throught to be moral issues. In his opinion, the key here is not enough resource for child care. People have hard time to find good resources for their kids. what needed here is to improve and get more resources for kids.RYB after learning the lesson should do much better in all areas. I think this incident in the end could be good a turning point for them to improve its quality."
RYB Education is down 10.53% to 3.40
"This is one of Chinese stock I think going to do great for the long term, Because it's dealing with children,"
several lawsuits have been brought up against ryb including Pomerantz and Rosen. Pomerantz has 80+ years in this business and Rosen is the no.2 to settle the equity class action cases in the country. the cash ryb is holding is probably not enough to cover the lawsuits cost.
"Told you so: RYB is oversold for fake reason.OMNT is also good buy: target is $12, given this online e-commerce just released 261% revenue growth!"
"RYB preschools and kindergarten are primarily for kids from rich families. if they are really bad and systemically abuse kids, how could they grow so fast?"
"where are the shares of this sucker? I cannot even borrow shares to short it? Probably, RYB bought them back to hold to avoid it collapse. But anyway when these shares are available I will short and people will short. It's not just for profit. It's for our Children!"
It is reported today one of the center in Beijing regularly drug and inject kids and invite a group of adult to sexually abuse the kids. The person who brought in the adult is the center directed/owners husband. Many parents reporting finding needle point marks on kids. Some kids abused ended up in emergency room. This is how it was discovered. The news n social media posts are being deleted or blocked.
anybody buying this is insane.
The Chinese are going to short this stock to death
fosl pushing higher it seems
Look at her fade just like I said. People. Easy money at open. Fade to close great trade
Even though it is wrong but most likely under public pressure authorities will close RYB ed. Inc. This is wrong because most of the company employees are innocent and their families depend on this facility. A good court ruling should be the beheading of these criminals at the door of the school and show on the national TV.
RYB BAGHOLDERS LOST MONEY!       
Why drop so much today?
"Should buy RYB asap now, Hold it higher and higher, and BUY !"
0 share available to short?
@Emma are you an IPO shareholder?
I think it is over valued.
"Looks weird, a good quarterly report, then with 13% drop"
"Done going down, folks. Chi-Coms did their ""thing,"" and now it's over. Time to buy; time to retrace to the upside. You're going to hate yourself for not buying at these levels, now. Same thing with QD. Party's over to the downside. Time to buy, and then buy more."
Prediction: A couple of days or week between $7.00-$8.50 and then an hour or two of BOOM!
earnings does matter. that's why q4 will be a problem because parents are telling each other. blocking messages by the government in China means something fishy. Otherwise they will just respond instead of blocking.
"Policy changes in China would not be a big deal since there is no rule would not be bent there. It is institutional mind change caused such a big drop, RYB should buy back shares big time and get onboard investors who knows China well, the fundamentals are sound , business would only go big there in China. Do not cut your loss yet if time is on your side"
RYB is down 8.14% to $16.70
Shame on RYB
Stock halted ? Not moving.
"this quarter earning is very bad, but the revenue outlook for next quarter is good, so the share price will come back"
RYB reporting tonight at 4pm... Result should be good and this will go to $23+
The whole thing was fake news?
"The most basic issue boils down to this: in view of what has happened, rumor or not, would you keep your kids in those schools? If yes, buy more stock and stop drinking. If not, short it or stay on sideline. What is unavoidable is american shareholders class action, possible school shutdown, death penalty. school needs to be rebranded or merged.must be crazy to go long."
"RYB is going to rise UP fast coming ! Hold it higher and higher, and Buy asap !"
The needle thing was last year wasn't it?
"a lot of rumors and serious allegations scared people away....might be a good opportunity to get in. if proven to be false, this one can really jump high. ..but I didn't dare to buy in last Friday. .."
"If you have a soul, only short this one. Anyone buying this for a pop should reevaluate their lives."
There is still no explicit and irrefutable evidence without some pictures and unconvincing statements from parents，I will stay neutral for more info released
Here we go!! (up)
RYB is down 13.51% to $7.30

"look at the volume, only 2.5m shares changed hand so far, that means no much seller or sorter now. The stock will back to normal range $25-30 on its way."
"So, is there any one shorted this stock in the name of “protect the children”"
Let’s short this mxxxxxxfxxxxx
Public trust is the key for this company’s future. Not sure it can regain the trust or not. An early education company has to expand very slowly and carefully not to have scandals like this.
"in a red day, RYB is green"
"Many individual investors were incited to short this last Friday, so 16-17 should be their cost and probably that’s what they want."
"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to China. For those who do not know, China has changed there one child per family policy. Now you may have 2. Many Chinese now make more money and millions of couples are currently trying for a second child. All this screams long-term buy for RYB. I also have a 3year old daughter myself and hope any wrong doing is punished swiftly and hardly. The company as a whole though has a growing market and string fundamentals."
"despite of the abuse issue. i do think RYB future is promising in longterm because if you have done the investigation on the china pre-school marketing, you will find it hard to get so called ""permission"" to set up one school, and it almost was somehow monopolized by someone with strong connection with government."
this stock will crash on Friday
who is tracking the 50MM USD buyback plan? institutions moves?
"Latest official report released, saying: no sexual abuse, most of them are rumors fabricated by journalists or some parents....."
ER tomorrow after market close?
"Keep Green, good job"
going to 12
Chinese government just announced that public companies are not allowed to run education business. Might be the reason.
"Perhaps, this one will go back $30.00 after the scandal. Not comfortable to short it... Hopefully, im wrong."
"Once bitten, twice shy"
Huge amount of middle class Chinese will fight this company for justice. Zero tolerance for child sex abuse.
when is the earning date?
"Have you looked at number of law firms shouting until blue trying to get people to join their class action lawsuit!Anytime RYB comes out with good news, they innundate news wire with lawsuit enlistment announcement! Odds are pretty good lawsuit will mount to not much and will profit law firms handsomely at existing shareholders. Those who lost m,oney will only get fraction of their loses if they get any at all!GLTA in stock casino!"
The police arrested several officials from the education authority in charge of reported ryb kindergarten in Beijing Chaoyang.
"Also buying JT, and QD . . . waaaay over done to the down side. These are fake Chinese stocks . . . they bounce back with gusto (in this phase of their price action). Were these stocks already years from their respective IPOs, then maybe, maybe they'd have a more difficult time, as a now viewed ""broken stock,"" e.g., MOMO, VIPS, LEJU . . . even SHOP has broken down (since that biting short report from a respected shorter - cannot remember his name - all of which have been cut in half, after a long, long run . . . But these guys - RYB, JT, QD - nah, these are buying opportunities, and will reach new highs before long. Seen it, done it."
manipulating powers to cover bloody crime. hell
Blue you short the stock?
Today had no enough stock to short and just ran for half day. Monday will drop another $10.00 or maybe direct sit on $2.00 chair!
"this whole IPO feels like yet another scam like LLEN, Suntech Solar, Oriental Paper just to name a few Chinese ipos that went bust."
"This was released last night b RYB..1 22 year old woman was fired and nother woman surnamed Liu was also arrested for allegedly disrupting social order by spreading false information about the alleged kindergarten abuse, Chaoyang police said."
"Jimbo, love your quaint sentiments when you say: ""If you guys think it is OK to make money from this company, then don't complain if one day your kids get molested. Because it is you who funds people to do this #$%$. What goes around comes around."" . . . Judge Moore, and your president, Donny-with-the-little-hands have shown us that people are forgiving - especially the flyovers. So, as RYB falls (IF if continues to fall), I buy more (started a position a couple of days ago). Will make MILLIONS on this fine company with the ONE BAD APPLE, avec the knitting needles."
"Hong, I know what you mean, and I know you know what you mean."
"If you're able to short this stock, don't miss this chance because of what they did, sexual assault, to only 3-year old kids in their kindergarten in the capital of China"
"The Operating Income: 2014 LOSS (-3000); 2015 LOSS (-1000); But 2016 Suddenly Became Not NEGATIVE of $8000! It is fake on income or really made that money? IF really made that amount, what did they do in 2016 to get the unbelievable miracle operating increase?"
Where is the earnings!
also balance cash is at $158.7m comparing $178.4m at Q3
RYB Education is down 13.96% to 4.13
Do u think China Gov let this company alive? Deal or Jail? Wait and See !
"Yes, RYB is ready for take off . . . look at today's great price action, on heavy volume. Appears all the bad old news is already priced in; now ready to re-take its IPO price, then higher."
"This caused massive angry. Now, China Police, Department of Education, Women's Federation, City of Beijing Government, etc. already starting for investigation. With many evidences as kids said and found on their bodies in China media, I highly concern this company will still have a credibility and getting government authorization to keep its license for continue to do the business in China.Let's say, in very rare chance, maybe it secure its license. But it will immediately face two problems. 1) Lost Credibility. Parents will seriously lost confidence to pay top dollars to have children send to the company; 2) large & many lawsuits and class lawsuits will be filed in Both China and Unites States courts for justice. If so, the revenue will drop down to the floor, the expense will go to the roof. What kind result will be, you can imagination, I will watch!"
Let’s sell ryb to the hell
I think this will drop by 60%
"Aunty Em . . . Where do I begin? Just the facts, ma'am:Never been so sure that IRS/Mueller have goods on Trump (Yikes! 400+K Trumpster documents . . . glad I'm retired now!) . . . and he and his erstwhile brilliant legal team know this (not kidding, ""believe me""); that the charges (to be made public ca. mid/late summer 2018 , , , I surmise) will be (at a minimum): 1) Federal Tax Evasion (multiple years . . . showing, crucially, a ""recurring pattern of evasion""), and 2) Aiding/abetting money laundering [a Federal crime, folks, asserted without regard to venue, i..e., asserted worldwide for US citizens]. Don's . . . or should I say, ""The Don's"" . . . feigned ""ignorance"" as to whom - or how much - he sold Trump apartments (in NYC and Panama City), and the half-dozen Florida properties at wildly inflated prices - ""indicia of overt acts of money laundering,"" as we who have had Special Enforcement Training and experience (IRS/Treas, DOJ) are all aware - is EASY to prove - especially with subpoena power. My guess is that, at some point in Mr. T's (and Jared's - aka: Jerry, Jare, Kushy) history of crushing debt (see Kushy's albatross building at 666 Fifth [666 . . . coinkadink?] unloaded to Kushy by the brilliant Tishman Speyer/TMW, for ca. 1.8B - all DEBT FINANCED), Trump and Kushy debt was purchased by ""the Russians,"" (and the Chi-Coms, in Kushy's case) . . . who recognize financial desperation when they see it . . . which makes Trump, et al. their eternal bit## (for life). Alas, impeachment and/or incarceration, won't help them.Inquisitive U.S. taxpaying citizens (doubtless, including you, Aunty Em) want to know: Why the countless lies re contacts with ""the Russians?"" . . . by NINE (and counting . . . 6 more ""persons of interest"" need to be interviewed . . . from what I ""hear"") . . . more indicia of fraud and deception; does not pass the ""reasonable man"" test.One last thing . . . Yes, there's no criminal code section referring to ""collusion."" Collusion is the nomenclature of ""civilians,"" not legal professionals. We call it ""conspiracy"" . . . as in: conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371, creates an offense ""[i]f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,"
This should see a nice boost soon I think $7.50-10!
there will be a privatization since according to new rules company doing children education are not allowed to fund through issuing stocks. Any idea what will be the privatization price?
premarket bid opening below $10 on Monday you been warned be very very afraid to loss alotlot of money on modday Tuesday all week next wek
"A good comparison is the ""toxic milk"" scandle about 10 years ago. It basically wiped out the entire Chinese dairy industry. Chinese still don't buy local brand dairy products now, particular those for kids such as formula. They only trust imports as long as they can afford. The damage is very long termed if not permanent. Similarly, RYB is very likely to be bankrupted by the current scandal. When coming to kids, Chinese people can be extremely serious"
Please short this stock！！
This stock is just weird to me—can’t get its rhythm at all.
"RYB Education responded yesterday, saying the company has provided documents and surveillance footage to police, and that the teachers allegedly involved have been suspended.The company also told police it has been falsely accused and framed by some people. This statement from the company. Be careful shorting as this story could go a completely another way."
"http://www.worldjournal.com/5301092/article-%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%86%8D%E5%82%B3%E5%B9%BC%E5%85%92%E9%81%AD%E9%87%9D%E5%88%BA-%E9%91%91%E5%AE%9A%E6%98%AF%E4%B9%BE%E6%80%A7%E6%BF%95%E7%96%B9/?ref=%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8Bsource : New York Chinese - pin #$%$ abuse of children was false, rumors spread faster than wild fire."
"Thanks for the info, JZ and Will. What do you think of other recent IPOs from the Chi-coms, e.g., REDU, SECO, QD?"
"lawsuits have been brought up against RYB. on the other hand, since police report indicated that some people intentially made up lies. if this is true, lawsuits shall also be filled against them to compensate shareholders."
Company is BUYBACK ! RYB is going to rise UP to $28.00+ ! Hold and Buy !
"Has been all over the news regarding the child abuse from one of these centres in Beijing. Children refused to go to school because they ""didn't want to take medicine when they aren't sick."" School refuses to release surveillance footage. Thumbs down."
Buy asap ! Buy as much as possible !Only way is UP fast coming ! Buy and Hold !
serious allegations
http://ir.rybbaby.com/2017-11-29-RYB-Education-Inc-Reports-Third-Quarter-2017-Financial-Results
I bought big today. I do not think the RYB have any big wrong in this case. One employee did wrong things not means the company's policy is wrong. All the lawsuits are very common things when the company stock downing big. And mostly time it just goes away if nothing is wrong. Also the report came out yesterday and it looks very good too. The business of RYB is only going good in the future based on the new chinese fertility policy and chinese economy getting better & stronger. Holding your shares you will appreciate.
I am expecting this sliding wont stop tomorrow
"We came from beijing , China. That problem was already solved , only one person had responsibility, small thing. We believe RYB is a good company, RYB is going to bounce UP to $25.00+ soon !Shold buy asap at this point and Hold it higher !"
