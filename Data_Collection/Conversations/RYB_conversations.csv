any news？
this stock will crash on Friday
I think this will drop by 60%
I chatted with one of my workers who had lived in Shanghai before. this business is booming. high end preschool and kindergarten are highly demanded. tuition is around $1000 TO $1600 per month in Beijing and Shanghai. waiting list is super long and kids need to wait for more than a year to get in.

Let’s short this mxxxxxxfxxxxx
RYB reporting tonight at 4pm... Result should be good and this will go to $23+
"This caused massive angry. Now, China Police, Department of Education, Women's Federation, City of Beijing Government, etc. already starting for investigation. With many evidences as kids said and found on their bodies in China media, I highly concern this company will still have a credibility and getting government authorization to keep its license for continue to do the business in China.Let's say, in very rare chance, maybe it secure its license. But it will immediately face two problems. 1) Lost Credibility. Parents will seriously lost confidence to pay top dollars to have children send to the company; 2) large & many lawsuits and class lawsuits will be filed in Both China and Unites States courts for justice. If so, the revenue will drop down to the floor, the expense will go to the roof. What kind result will be, you can imagination, I will watch!"
earnings does not matter. company reputation at stake and next quarter parents will stop sending to this school. so it will not have similar report next quarter
going to 12
Forces Awakening!
I bought big today. I do not think the RYB have any big wrong in this case. One employee did wrong things not means the company's policy is wrong. All the lawsuits are very common things when the company stock downing big. And mostly time it just goes away if nothing is wrong. Also the report came out yesterday and it looks very good too. The business of RYB is only going good in the future based on the new chinese fertility policy and chinese economy getting better & stronger. Holding your shares you will appreciate.
several lawsuits have been brought up against ryb including Pomerantz and Rosen. Pomerantz has 80+ years in this business and Rosen is the no.2 to settle the equity class action cases in the country. the cash ryb is holding is probably not enough to cover the lawsuits cost.
"What is interesting here is that investors outside China put money into a company inside China and they have no reliable information other than third party or forth party info, PRs, etc.At this price range, it is not worth the risk."
RYB Education is up 10.71% to 3.10
The police report triggered people's anger. There is no logic that more than 10 parents report rumors to the police at the same time. The hard drive of the monitoring system is conveniently broken. They paid high fees to get in this kindergarden.
"We know they are lying, and they know they are lying, they even know we know it, we even know they know we know it, they even know we know they know we know it, but they still chose to do so."
"it should be time for this one to recover some. no reason to continuely decrease.child education is a very promising area in China,especially for one child family. the incidents happened for the one school of RYB should be independent and shouldn't be thought to a common issue. I believe most people in China understand this and won't affect by the incident. I am not sure what kind of business has better potentials and future than what RYB is doing now. Giving some time, this one should take off. good time to accumulation."
ER tomorrow after market close?
"It was reported some government officials in charge of education were being investigated for the RYB incident. It is kind of fishy here: if RYB is innocent, what are the government officials being investigated for?"
Anyone knows what happened?
Today had no enough stock to short and just ran for half day. Monday will drop another $10.00 or maybe direct sit on $2.00 chair!
Why it’s dropping so quick again?
This is a $30 stock. i think it will rise up fast very soon.
"The Operating Income: 2014 LOSS (-3000); 2015 LOSS (-1000); But 2016 Suddenly Became Not NEGATIVE of $8000! It is fake on income or really made that money? IF really made that amount, what did they do in 2016 to get the unbelievable miracle operating increase?"
is RYB the leader in this sector? does anyone know names of its competitors? we need to do some studies and find out if RYB can weather through this storm. price right now is so attractive...
It is reported today one of the center in Beijing regularly drug and inject kids and invite a group of adult to sexually abuse the kids. The person who brought in the adult is the center directed/owners husband. Many parents reporting finding needle point marks on kids. Some kids abused ended up in emergency room. This is how it was discovered. The news n social media posts are being deleted or blocked.
Why is RYBeye down this AM?
Does anybody has the information about RYB's short interest and percentage?
What’s happening??
"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to China. For those who do not know, China has changed there one child per family policy. Now you may have 2. Many Chinese now make more money and millions of couples are currently trying for a second child. All this screams long-term buy for RYB. I also have a 3year old daughter myself and hope any wrong doing is punished swiftly and hardly. The company as a whole though has a growing market and string fundamentals."
"Has been all over the news regarding the child abuse from one of these centres in Beijing. Children refused to go to school because they ""didn't want to take medicine when they aren't sick."" School refuses to release surveillance footage. Thumbs down."
"I think ER showed good growth for a small cap stock, but not at a very exciting rate..."
Short this mdfk
Cost was high because it went to public last year. I think the business is doing well. I believe the price will go up for sure.
"This stock was manipulated by some shorts. The news was leaked out on Thanksgiving day for one individual case at one school ( they have near 100 school). The news was spread on social network, and hit on the day after Thanksgiving days. It is just tactics to maximize the price move. I have seen the similar thing before, but for now days, the social network makes much big impact. I bought on that day and sold after two days bounces. I will do the same today. Forget the news, do the research yourself to make your own judgment."
