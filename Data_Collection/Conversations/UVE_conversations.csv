5.5x forward earnings. that is like finding a unicorn in this market. bought few times this afternoon. price dropped every time after a purchase. unless there is a big seller or a large short seller cannot make out the price action. adding more if the market keeps dropping it.
Hurricane season looking over and the stock can't get any traction. What is the excuse this time?
Bots and Shorts ? Big holder bailing out ? Shorts cashing in on Market weakness ?Sentiment ? thanks to the decimation in FNHC UIHC HRTG ? CAT damage of some sort ?
My Problems with UVEStarted buying UVE at $6.75 years ago and kept buying down to $3.30. Stock then climbed into mid $20. Life was good despite the CEO and C suite taking a large shares of earnings. UVE expanded into other states which was good but they still had a large exposure in southeast Florida. UVE typically made good business decisions except C suite kept taking too much compensation and kept selling shares. Then short sellers got involved dropping the stock and a huge near miss of a large hurricane. Ultimately got out due to storm risk but primarily from C suite compensation that greatly reduced shareholder earnings and was a drag on the stock.
UVE reaffirms annual $2.75-3.00 a share in earnings. 4.7-5 forward PE. A dividend of 4.7% (probably will be raised).
Insider still dumping shares in September according to Yahoo insider. Very reassuring to investors.
Uve and Hrtg are great buys right now. EPS will continue up as the premium increase are earned and recognized. And with UVE there is a nice kicker. Half way through hurricane season without ANY in Florida. And who cares about hurricanes anyway? UVE has survived and thrived and grown through the best and worst of Mother Nature.I love these sorts of opportunities.
"The question isWhy buy a stock that is so vulnerable to severe wealth events that are inevitable especially since an important director sold 100,000 shares this year alone? If the stock is cheap, insiders would be lining up to buy more shares."
Universal Insurance is up 5.78% to 14.28
"Fingers crossed hurricane season goes out with a whimper and early, bring on the cold fronts."
"It would be nice if the largest insider shareholder would quit selling 20,000 shares each month. Doesn't give much confidence for anyone else who holds the shares."
"I have to think the disconnect between earnings, value and price per share has to dissipate eventually. I will stay long."
"A few more hurricanes and storms will do wonders for this company. If the stock was so great, you would see insider buying instead of selling. The Chief Technology Officer only owns 3,117 shares. At least buy another 100 if you think the company will continue to prosper in the future."
"I estimate 20-80% upside within the next year at the current market price of $27. Considering Sean Downes' recent comments about the second quarter being good, I estimate that current book value is around $16.35 per share, or 5% above Q1 book value (in line with their historical growth rates for BVPS). The normal trading range for the stock is 2-3X book value, which puts us in a range of $33 to $49. If it's a light hurricane season, I expect to see high ROE's and trading up around 3X book value. If it's a bad season, I'd expect it to be closer to 2X BV. Either way, the current price is a steal. Time to buy another 500 shares."
relief over Louisiana hit ?
Beautiful results! Stock remains a great one to buy. The company is in control.
"Henri mostly rain and flooding, not much wind damage ?"
"Excellent results by UVE. Revenues are way up. Net income is also up nicely. Balance sheet is much better. UVE is a highly profitable company. They will likely earn net income of over $80 million this year. The company is far undervalued. I think we could see $30 per share this year. Prices for insurance are being raised, and that is a great harbinger for UVE. For Q3 2021, UVE reported net income of over $20 million for the quarter. UVE reported EPS of $0.64 on a GAAP basis and $0.63 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Quarterly direct premiums earned were up 15% from the year-ago quarter to $410.6 million, with an annualized return on average equity of 16.4%. That is excellent."
With the waning threat of hurricanes one might think the stock would start rising and yet here we are.
"And another minor hurricane that completely missed FL. UVE has zero policies in Texas, zero in Louisiana. Everything is aligning for 2021 EPS of over $2.50. 2022 will push $3.50 with the higher premiums."
