Time for current management to increase ROE by trimming the dead wood of highly compensated executives that failed to stay ahead of the curve on AOB and managing adequate reserves. A purge of those who have acheived their Peter Principle is in order.HRTG management saw it coming.
UVE gets no respect cant even get any analysts interestedAnthony Bozza and Whitney Tilson still spinning their tales to those who will listen ?
"Wind speeds at 2pm today in St. Augustine, Fl...13 miles per hourStrong Buy"
"Joe, if you think the stock is going down, you would want to keep on selling."
What we need is an El Nino but 84cents is certainly encouraging.
Lots of Sep put buying forcing options market makers to short shares to hedge their positions
"Time for new management, Sean Downes costs us a fortune in more ways than one starting with Thanksgiving of 2015. His latest AOB fiasco is just unforgivable especially given his pay. Looks like Mr Wall Street is giving his leadersip a vote of No Confidence."
"Totally liquidated my position in UVE today and reinvested the cash elsewhere. Sick of seeing the insiders being granted all these shares while the shareholders have been crushed over the last couple years. I'm fine with well compensated managers if they are performing, but the level of compensation these guys are getting for lousy performance was the last straw for me."
Today is the day to watch shorts stain their shorts over UVE.
Do they have any guidance on how many folks are defaulting on the insurance premiums with this virus. that will impact the results too. They need to provide guidance on it pretty soon.
unbelievable...
"Another 2,000,000 incentive shares registered for horrible performance . Tilson was right"
Billion dollar market cap straight ahead!!
"""Prior year reserve development was primarily made up of a $40.7 million reduction in anticipated subrogation recoveries in the fourth quarter,""Reads like some entity is slow to pay ? that is more than a $1 per share. Sep transcript mentioned them waiting on Florida reinsurance reimbursements"
"I estimate 20-80% upside within the next year at the current market price of $27. Considering Sean Downes' recent comments about the second quarter being good, I estimate that current book value is around $16.35 per share, or 5% above Q1 book value (in line with their historical growth rates for BVPS). The normal trading range for the stock is 2-3X book value, which puts us in a range of $33 to $49. If it's a light hurricane season, I expect to see high ROE's and trading up around 3X book value. If it's a bad season, I'd expect it to be closer to 2X BV. Either way, the current price is a steal. Time to buy another 500 shares."
Excellent. fast growing revenue and stronger profits. Beat estimates by a mile. Analysits expected 91 cents. UVE hit 1.12 per share..beautiful cash cow.Likely will head over Likely will head over 44 per share.
where are the buybacks? is the management sleeping. Anyone knows why this thing keeps going down.
"UVE is going to see a great benefit as the corporate tax rate gets reduced. UVE is not a multination corporation who has double-Dutch schemes and such, and therefore one of the many companies that pay very high tax rates.. UVE pays the 35% tax rate. They are paying around $50 million per year in tax on pre-tax profit of about $150 million per year. They consistently pay beyond 33% in taxes. A reduction in tax rate to 20% will do great things for UVE. UVE is way undervalued."

I just bought some more
Management should be buying more shares soon. They can afford it with what they pay themselves.
"Blockrock's recent filings with SEC seem to show them buying into the Florida based insurers UVE, FNHC, HRTG. An interesting development that might require more digging into."
"From latest 8K:Sean Downes only renewed for 1 year and takes a pay cut ?Base salary of $1M, was more than that before, last contract was in 2016Maybe the Board is waking up to reality."
"Lousy results. Glad I got out of UVE in the beginning of the year. Are any of UVE's competitors making money, or are they all in the same boat with lousy underwriting and combined ratios >100%?"
"UVE pays too much for re insurance. It is buying from state and other third parties. A substantial part of the earnings go for the same. Other insurance companies only buy the state, hence have more cash in hand. I think the management should focus on removing the extra insurance so that it has a better cash in hand and a better eps. Hope the management and the institutions are taking a note of this."

"Springer and Donaghy bought 10,000 shares each. Nothing reported for Downs."
Continuing to hold but these guys need to get their act together. Stop under-reserving for gosh sakes. So much potential here and lots of talk. Time to execute. I'll give them another year to prove themselves and remain cautiously optimistic. If they significantly miss their 2020 guidance I'm out.
What's your opinion; do you think they will beat q3 earnings and the stock could rise?
79 cents
"In some ways, as a long term investor in UVE, it was nice of the bear raiders to allow me to load up on more shares after the crash. Thanks sleazeball bear raiders."
Way to go UVE crushes it again!!! .38 eps 4th quarter handily beats analysts estimates of .30... they also did this with a major hurricane in the 4th quarter... that hurricane took off 44 cents to the eps in 4th quarter so if they didnt have a hurricane it would have been .82 cents which would have been awesome... some highlights i saw in the earnings release were the 40% plus growth in premiums written in the outside of florida market... the 90% plus growth increase in investment returns for 4th quarter... investment returns for insurance companies on general is going to be huge with all the interest rate hikes expected this next year... with only one rate hike it helped uve whats going to happen if the fed hikes 2 to 3 times next year??? Hmm i like it!!
Bought more UVE today. Great price.
"looks like Florence may be shifting S into northern SC UVE only has 13000 properties in SC vs 48000 in NClooks likes Ted's hopes of death and destruction enriching him are only going to cost him money now, what a sad lost soul you are gloating over making money off of others misery"
Vanguard seems to have increased their position by 13% to over 10% in most recent filing. Would guess they're buying more here ? maybe they're pushing the price down to buy more ?
"UVE was expected to have net income of $0.65 per share. UVE came in with net revenue of $172 million for net quarter and net income of $0.75 per share. UVE blew away both revenue and earnings estimates. This is a new record in revenue I believe. The profits and cash are also rolling in strongly for this company. The company has shareholder equity of over $370 million and has net income of over $100 million per year. I believe the company is conservatively worth over $1.2 billion. That would put share price over $34 per share. I don’t see a good reason for it to remain under $34 per share for long. Beautiful ! They expanded their footprint and were strongly profitable. As I said on a month ago, I was hoping for $3 per share in net income for the year and UVE is definitely on track to hitting that huge record. The $27 million in net income is very impressive. Shareholders’ equity is up strongly. A lot more people in UVE’s region of the USA are realizing the importance of insurance. UVE strongly outperformed UIHC. This one is way undervalued. See you over $34 per share soon. Stock will gap up tomorrow."
Any one nervous about next earnings with hurricane numbers being within that earnings period?

Great to see some investors posting here. I doubt the shares move fast but I do think it will begin a steady upward march.
UVE reached a new 52 Week High at 28.70
A lot more cash and profit rolls in for UVE. These are excellent results.EPS came in stronger at $0.70 per share for the latest quarter.I especially like the growth and the strong guidance.Probably UVE will exceed $20 per share this year.
This guy sounds like theclatest incarnation of Anthony Bozza and Whitney Tilson.Management should have dealt with these people long ago ! http://stocktwits.com/MarketMontana/message/175943379
Any thoughts on the recent upticks in price? Insider buying? Possible dividend increase?

"Henri mostly rain and flooding, not much wind damage ?"
Nice quarter! If we have one of those mild seasons with no major hurricane landfall in FL we could be seeing a TTM EPS pushing $5 come February.
"The adjusted earnings should be at least a $1.50/Shr. instead of the $.13/Shr. reported. A $97.3 million dollar extraordinary expense for an adjustment of prior period loss reserves should be taken into account when evaluating the quarterly report. Consequently, the stock should be up instead of the shorts taking it down. UVE is worth in excess of $60/Shr."
Fabulous results! The stock is way to cheap. I will keep buying. Multi year upward trend will commence.
Earnings date declared. Lets see if they beat this time.

"Dodged the bullet in Hawaii ?Hawaii radar and local weather forecasts for the islands only show tstorms, rain and 30some mph winds.Is anyone aware of anything worse ?"
I will buy some more. UVE in great shape. Hurricane season behind us.
Should get info on special dividend this week or next week (11-12-19 until 11-22-19)
Time to institute the buy back
"In other words, you're fired ?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/universal-insurance-holdings-announces-sean-201500483.html"
And considering the 4th quarter earnings disaster there's no apparent reason why anyone in management should be deserving of any sort of bonuses. Truly abysmal performance especially on the part of the Board Of Directors who are our eyes and ears.
"Welcome to hurricane season. Once it looks like a hurricane will be heading toward Florida, the stock will begin falling in an overreaction. Accumulate on weakness."
"2019 hurricane season expected to be near average, Colorado State University outlook saysOn April 4 the Colorado State University (CSU) Tropical Meteorology Project released a new forecast for the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, which predicted fewer storms and hurricanes but warned that that does not mean it will be less dangerous."
The 6% drop in ore market should have been the worst of it today. Not sure who brought it down so low but thanks. Picked quite a fee up at around 31. Will recover most of the loss.
"Shorts backs are breaking. Shorts are finally admitting defeat and are covering their short positions on UVE.In the most recent update on short-interest:Short Interest (Number of Shares Short) has been reduced to 2,520,200.Short interest reduction (percentage change) from the prior period was a whopping -24 % !!Shorts are no longer confident that UVE has below average management. In fact, in seeing them buy back around A MILLION share in the past month, shorts are actually running scared and admitting they don't think there is any drop coming in UVE stock price. Maybe they have also tired of paying longs the repeated dividends. :) Shorts are now admitting this is a financially sound company. Thanks for all the money, Shorties!"
"As of December 31 there are 2,000,000 shares shorted up 400,000 from two weeks prior.And the unbelievers here wonder who is selling."
Does anyone know if the recent stock purchases by Downes were option grants or not.
Zeta is incredible still strengthening over cooler water and wind shear. That is 2020 - a year of pain in from Covid to Hurricanes to Lockdown Induced Unemployment to you name it.
Every quarter their seems to be some unexpected event that hurts earnings. Solution is to be more conservative in underwriting and raise rates. Underwriting needs to improve before UVE stock can soar again.
"Getting close to hurricane season, which means there will be occasional periods of overreactions. I will be adding on dips."
We should get a dividend announcement this week ( 11-05-18 thru 11-09-18)
Here's the problem with UVE and any other insurer.. Weather is the variable. The last couple of years it hasn't been good. UVE comes out with guidance that excludes most events.. So in a perfect year they can hit their number $.. But perfect years may not happen.. If this is a $3 annual earning stock it should be trading in the $30's at least.. But it doesn't. Good luck
Currently company is in a blackout period before earnings which means SEC greenlights the manipulators. Analysts are unaccountable to anyone and can post any figures they want while management is gagged and can't or won't refute them. So we get hung out to dry.
UVE reached a new 52 Week High at 35.40
"As per the earnings call, AOB reform bill should have a positive impact on the earnings, organic growth is very good. Management compensation has been reduced too. More buyback to continue. everything is in the right direction in my opinion. they should increase the dividend at some point."

My Problems with UVEStarted buying UVE at $6.75 years ago and kept buying down to $3.30. Stock then climbed into mid $20. Life was good despite the CEO and C suite taking a large shares of earnings. UVE expanded into other states which was good but they still had a large exposure in southeast Florida. UVE typically made good business decisions except C suite kept taking too much compensation and kept selling shares. Then short sellers got involved dropping the stock and a huge near miss of a large hurricane. Ultimately got out due to storm risk but primarily from C suite compensation that greatly reduced shareholder earnings and was a drag on the stock.
buy all you can. Usually see this type of move before a buyout. its extremely cheap. After it survived the worst hurricane in history this is a cash cow
I suspect with the continued strong results UVE is a buyout candidate of a large insurance conglomerate. I would venture to say an offer of $45 or maybe even $50 is possible
"this is rediculous ..why they take 4months to report the earnings (last earnings reported on oct 30) . there is no reversal until earnings. still 9 trading days left. I can't take it anymore. goes down everyday, on what basis no idea."
looks like a good day to further acquire from my monitor. no worries... UVE always beats expectations
"Bottom line, Management has lost control of the stock, its just a game piece now, a pawn being toyed with for others profit."
Tons of puts traded and a ton of buying of some sort ? What brought the buyers in ?
I imagine the company is buying back a lot of stock. This is insane while all you hear on the news is markets are making new highs.
"If the upside is limited because of risk of an extraordinary weather even, and the downside in any one year is limited because of reinsurance, and the premium rates charged are determined or approved by the Office of Insurance Regulations, and the dividend is over 4%, isn't that more or a less a utility? The litigation environment and the rates charged by Citizens (the state's last-resort property insurer) are determined by by Florida legislature. I've held this stock for years and notwithstanding the annual hoopla over the most recent set of hurricanes, it acts like a utility."

"I see that Sean is getting incentive options after ""all he has done for us"". Biting my tongue. So many of their options are out of the money and worthless now. The only one that should maybe be getting incentive options is Donaghy, the rest of them deserve to suffer like us if not moreso."
UVE needs to hire Trumps tax guy. Pay zero taxes.
Should be getting Q4/FY earnings release date soon
Hurricane season looking over and the stock can't get any traction. What is the excuse this time?
"Fingers crossed hurricane season goes out with a whimper and early, bring on the cold fronts."
Higher earnings estimate due to a much lower tax rate (from 40% to 26%). I'm estimating $1.10 or more. UVE will take off once these earnings are announced (watch out shorts).
"I have to think the disconnect between earnings, value and price per share has to dissipate eventually. I will stay long."

"Dividend announcement should come this week, hopefully at least .14 plus .15 special."
"More insider buying (CEO purchased ~$285K worth of stock). The COO also recently had a large purchase as well. These guys know their business, and their actions suggest that the stock is undervalued. Don't be scared off by these low prices, buy more and lower your cost basis... these low prices won't stick around forever!"

Happy to buy at the discount.
2020 EPS guidance was 2.80 to 3.10 without any extra-ordinary events. If you subtract the 44M after-tax loss you are left with about 1.30 to 1.60 EPS in 2020. The current stock price is about right. 2021 will be no better. Weather events will only worsen due to climate change. There is no future here. I will hold until I get to my buying price which may be very long.
This seems overdone

Awesome company selling super cheap. This is the time to be buying people.
"They mentioned they have licenses for 4 additional states, aware of N Hamp, W Vir and Iowa, what is the 4th"
I am still waiting for the guidance on defaults for the quarter and guidance on the next quarter. Publishing the results when all is done will not help anyone. These folks should also fix the management compensation. Giving stocks to employees and then buying back shares does not reduce the outstanding shares. They have brought at high prices and will use those for compensation. It is ridiculous.
"Long term holder since 2010. Great example of ignoring the emotions that come into play with the market. Whether it was the recommendation to ""short"" that was not based on facts or the potential for a hurricane that could wipe out FL. Trust your gut. Stay long with good companies and you'll be rewarded."
Mark it: $46.00 by year end - A hypothetical buyout next year (2020) will be priced even higher. Get in while the tree is being shaken.
Anything interesting in the conference call ? Have to work can't lusten no transcript yet.

"Can someone enlighten me? Is this UVE?In consent orders signed by Florida Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier, Universal Insurance Co. of North America (UICNA) was approved to drop 13,294 personal residential policies and Gulfstream Property & Casualty was approved to cancel about 20,311 personal residential policies. Both insurers will remove the policies over the next 45 days.Southern Fidelity Insurance Co. was approved to nonrenew approximately 19,600 personal residential policies over the next 14 months, with approximately 2,300 receiving less than the required statutory written notice of nonrenewal.The early cancellation and nonrenewals of policies is “an extraordinary statutory remedy reserved to address insurers which are or may be in hazardous financial condition,” the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation stated in the orders, which also require the insurers to take other steps to stay solvent.The regulator’s actions are the most recent indicators of Florida’s stressed insurance marketplace that has been described as “spiraling towards collapse.” Altmaier and others have previously warned of problems for Florida’s domestic companies thanks to spiking litigation, dishonest contracting practices, catastrophe events and high reinsurance costs. Florida insurers were reported to have lost a combined $1.7 billion in 2020.“OIR remains focused on the protection of consumers and fostering stability in Florida’s insurance marketplace,” OIR said in a statement to Insurance Journal. “Allowing for the early cancellation or nonrenewal of policies is not a decision made lightly, and requires a finding that such action is necessary to protect the best interests of the public or policyholders.”The respective orders outline what “hazardous” financial conditions led to the approval of the policy cancellations and nonrenewals:Universal Insurance Co. of North America (UICNA)UICNA’s cancellation of 13,294 of its 57,000 Florida policies will occur as part of a financial restructuring plan that includes a merger with and into Universal North America Insurance Co., a Texas domestic company.UICNA reported net losses of $4.1 million in 2019 and $22.5 million in 2020, and had decreased its surplus by more than $9 million as of Dec. 31, 2020, OIR stated in the order approving the policy cancellations. UICNA’s surplus deterioration came despite the company receiving capital contributions of $13.5 million, without which it would have been considered an impaired insurer as it would have fallen below Florida’s minimum required surplus of $10 million.OIR said UICNA provided financial projections that show without the cancellation of the approximately 9,341 homeowners policies and 3,953 dwelling policies, the company’s financial condition would further deteriorate to an unsustainable level by the end of 2021.Given UICNA’s catastrophe loss experience, higher reinsurance costs, and significantly increased litigation, the identified policies for cancellation would “provide an immediate impact to the company’s financial position and facilitate the completion of a financial restructuring plan to protect its policyholders and the public,” the order says.The policy cancellations are also a condition of the company’s merger plan, OIR said, which is still subject to approval by the Texas regulator. If the merger plan is not approved, or if Universal North America Insurance Co. is unsuccessful in becoming licensed in Florida, “UICNA agrees it will consent to immediate administrative supervision, for the purpose of conserving assets while UICNA develops a fully funded plan,” the OIR order states.UICNA must file its plan of merger with OIR and the Texas Department of Insurance no later than May 14, 2021, and must provide at least 45 days’ notice of cancellation to the affected policyholders. UICNA must also continue to file monthly financial statements with OIR until further notice and submit an updated business plan to the regulator by Aug. 1, 2021 for the period of July 1, 2021 through Dec. 31, 2024. The plan must include the company’s ability to generate “successful operation results by the implementation of underwriting changes, rate adjustments, operational savings, capital management, and other significant modifications to its current business model.”"

Someone's head has to be served up on a platter for this disaster. We need transparency and the assurance that tjose who failed to foresee the AOB and INBR debacle are removed from the decision making process from here out. Show them the door.You can't convince me that the Board of Directors was doing its job of oversight with any diligence for this mismanged nightmare to rear its head. Hopefully Donaghy sorted it all out and the damage done is behind us.Never again.
Complete over-reaction.

"Lakewood Capital Bozo and his sidekick Tilson came out with their shorting attack last November. The stock went to $16, and Tilson was caught with blatant exaggerations as he said he was “sure UVE was going to $0 per share”. Since then, UVE has risen to $24.60 per share. Oh, how wrong Tilson was! In November, Bozo will come up with a new attempt to manipulate another stock in the small cap market. He has stayed relatively quiet because there have be a lot of complaints filed to the SEC, based on his prior attempted manipulation. Bozo and Tilson will recommend a new prime short candidate to their lemmings in 1.5 months and they and their lemmings will close their current short and jump on the new bandwagon. When they cover their shorts on UVE, UVE will climb and they will do their best to manipulate the new victim stock. This is a great time to get into UVE and maybe to later purchase their next victim stock (after their new victim settles). UVE rose over 50% in the past 10 months, so probably their next victim of market manipulation will also be a very good purchase at the end of November as well."

We are in the middle of hurricane season and that will keep the share price down even though the reinsurance strategy proved extremely effective last year. The stock will be back in the $35-$40 range for those patient enough to wait it out. As an investor I could care less what the traders are doing

what happened to the quarterly dividend? they usually announce it by this time of the year. thoughts?
Looking at the call in show one would think this company is hurting big time????? Why do they use these insurance numbers to miss lead the common person into thinking this company is going down???? Adjustment earnings should have been use to explain the drop in earnings. This was a misleading report that should have been handle in a different way.
Why is it going down everyday? Is there something we don't know about the losses? And where are the buybacks?

Thought we were doomed to close for a loss today and I come back to my desk all bummed out and I see we closed slightly up.Fingers crossed that institutions are liking Downes gone and Donaghy cleaning up his mess once and for all.
Wow.. What a 2 month run down..
Again we are the leader down..
"UVE doesn't exhibit a pattern of understating their reserve estimates and shouldn't be penalized this drastically. This is an overreaction benefiting the shorts and the market makers who are loading up on the cheap. If your selling, you'll be very sorry when this goes over $50."

Is there a point in having a home insurance business. Since they have started diversifying the insurance there profits have disappeared. They pay over $400 million in hurricane related reinsurance and what we get for it nothing. There loss plus expense is now consistently above 100. Their loss plus expenses are always going to be above 100 so why have the insurance business at all. WE already have done AOB reform and even after that there is no money for us.The home owner insurance rates sucks in Florida and other states and it is a regulated industry so let the state put tax payer money instead of my moneyif an institutional investor is there they should either take this private and there after remove the hurricane reinsurance and have a roll with it. either you shall make a lots of money or go bankrupt if the hurricane strikein both case you can make moneyPlease liquidate this business and give my money back or take this privatewhat you long term shareholders think why we should provide any service to the state of florida for nothingthis is my money and give me back. I do not want to sell i want the cash value of the business

I had been in the process of bailing out of UVE. But with an average cost of $4. Just sealed the deal with this earning report. I'm out.
"$43M retention on Florida and $15M elsewhere, i guess its leaked they will be claiming these numbers, storms have been bad this year, shorts and market insiders seem to know everything before we do."
1 analyst says -$2.38 other one says +$.53. I really feel that if the results are not close to $-2.38. Such analyst should be fired and not allowed to cover the companies they don't understand. they have one job to do and they cannot do properly. They should not be allowed any further. I still it will be close to $1 earnings for Q4.

Great to see shorts getting burned. The new analysts' estimates are going to burn them MUCH more.
Nice to see that UVE beat Q4 2020 consensus estimate. Numbers better than expected.
"Despite a long tradition of stockpicking in the US I am amazed that so few seem to follow UVE. The new legislation (passed Friday, 3 days ago) and its hopefully positive effects on Florida's insurerers seem to be below the radar for most investors. However, one of the cornerstones to achieve a healthy Floridian home insurance market is now in place (unless litigation lawyers find new ways to parasite on the market)."
"Amazing that the SEC hss yet to do anything about unrestricted Short Selling, at least restore the uptick rule if nothing else. Let shareholders decide for themselves what the shares are worth."
"I'm curious to know what you folks think about that puny ($80 million revenue per year), low assets, franchise-based insurance company that is currently valued at $2.8 Billion? It is called Goosehead Insurance (GSHD). Management promotes it and continues to dump its stock. To me, it seems like an overvalued bomb waiting to fall apart any quarter now. I have shorted it this week. Its debt is high, its growth has slowed and it hasn't been able to earn significant profits, so that is the only thing I could do is short it. What do you think of GSHD?"
I don't get it. Why is the projected earnings for UVE so bad? What happened?
"Hopping in now, buying more thank you very much"

"Florida Insurance market general condition may appear not to be so good in recent past, but that is behind usThe state is a wonderful place with a lot of people moving into the state.This is a required business and every home owner is required to have insurance. there was abuse in the market which has been corrected by legislation and market shall improve.This is a wonderful time to buy this share. Load up the share"
"And another minor hurricane that completely missed FL. UVE has zero policies in Texas, zero in Louisiana. Everything is aligning for 2021 EPS of over $2.50. 2022 will push $3.50 with the higher premiums."
Fednat had another unfavorable reserve adjustment from prior year claims. Does this mean we'll see the same thing on UVE's Q4 results? NO. But it's certainly possible and it's clearly what the analysts think with negative estimates. This is creating fear in the sector. We have a setup here for an absolutely massive rally if the Q4 results are good. If it's another negative Q4 we may see the price drop into the high teens with stock trading right around book value.
$1.12 vs expected 0.91 ... :D

"UVE currently pays out only 13% of its earnings as a dividend, according to its trailing twelve-month data, which means that the dividend is covered by earnings. If it continues to drop before earnings, I'm adding."
"my opinion about UVE1. Lots of industry experts think they are insolvent. Why??They don’t pay claims, are Massively under reserved, have tens of thousands open lawsuits that are bleeding them dry, massively overexposed to TriCounty, and Dowling says they are through the top of their reinsurance tower. 2. Adverse development like this is beyond shocking and is ripe for shareholder lawsuit. Look at the numbers: 4Q 2017 50m, 4Q 2018 100m, 4Q 2019 125m. These numbers are massive and reflect a pattern of under reserving that is getting worse. 3. Subrogation reserves?? Huh? What? These guys booked nearly 100m of anticipated subrogation reserves and dropped this “assumption” into reserves instead of putting in cash. What should the number be...5m max. More pain to come. I mean seriously, they have #1 market share in Tri-County and have been carrying NEGATIVE IBNR reserves? That’s impossible and everyone with a brain knows it. There isn’t one insurance executive that bought this BS. Apparently the actuaries are finally taking action. 4. Reinsurers hate UVE. Why??? Because they billed massive amounts of money to the reinsurers for claims adjusting and then bragged about it. Example: 4Q 2017 they booked 50m in adverse development and then billed the reinsurers 50m for adjusting losses. They did it throughout 2018 to pump up the numbers but now that game is over and they can’t plug the hole any more. Reinsurers see this type of behavior and walk away and that will likely cause their pricing to increase. 5. They actually said that they didn’t see AOB coming and that’s why the took over the TriCounty. Are they blind?? It’s all everyone complained about since 2015. It’s BS. They just wanted to feed investors with “growth” and then decided to underpay claims and underserve losses. Stock price goes up, insiders sell, company looks fantastic....until it doesn’t. The past predicts the future. Their prior numbers are pure fiction. If they were real they wouldn’t have 275m of adverse development. So don’t believe there “guidance” for 2020. It’s more BS IMO. The only company that saw all of this and moved quickly is HRTG. It is painful when you shut off growth for 3 years but they knew that it was better to exit TriCounty, take your lumps, diversify the company and increase loss reserves. They did it while turning a profit every year. Now they are much stronger, more stable and growing top line outside of Florida. Why own UVE at a premium to book value when you can own HRTG at a big discount to book value? Don’t investors want to buy low and sell high?These are just my opinions, but please tell me where I’m wrong...."

"Selling is reaching panic levels now. Maximum hit to UVE is less than $1 per share, post-tax, on a worst case basis.Added $20 calls here."
unless i interpret the reinsuance incorrectlyit appears UVE out of state loss per occurrence is limited to $5 Million for Florence ?
WOW still dropping.
Based on Sep 10Q they spent $11.1M repurchasing 342K shares in the prior 9 months Hopefully they spent the last $9M buying this downdraft and replenished it with the new $20M program. 
i just hope they keep diversifying in other states with at least 30% revenue coming from other states keeping expenses and management compensation low. They should also increase the dividend. With all this and AOB law taking effect it is a good long term bet. Their aim should be to bring the eps to 5-6 dollars soon. They are very smart folks and will get there soon.
End game here is for shorts to drive it as low as they can while they have management gagged and bound. Any good earnings results will he meaningless as any rebound will still be be to a price that is lower than when it all started. SEC didnt think uptick rule was necessary as predatory short sellers apparently don't exist.

Will be oversold soon if not already as market prices every hurricane as the second coming of Katrina.
"Overall, UVE is looking like a pretty good value down here in the $17 range. The beat EPS estimates. Their business is not significantly impacted by the pandemic. The conference call sounded quite good. Earnings guidance is strong. If they can bring in $3 in EPS, then P/E is around 5.7 which is excellent. Balance sheet is excellent. The stock has been beaten down to half of last year's valuation. This is looking like a very good buy while it is below $25 per share."
"I've a question: Didn't the FTC impose a $.05 increment for bid/ask prices? I've noticed lately that trades APPEAR to be happening at intermediate prices (like the rest of the stocks in the market). Did that restriction expire? Or, am I just getting dotty in my old age. :)"
Down she goes again..
It's a sad state of affairs when the analyst is more reluable than yoyr own management. Kudos to Broomall.https://www.dowling.com/analyst_information?ref=a062E00001Rf0qfQAB
"I have read everyone's commentary, and while I am greatly disappointed in the results, I think we also need to cut management a break. I think the one thing that a lot of folks have missed is the fact that UVE has diversified into new markets which have different underlying claims rates in an effort to diversify the business and provide all of us with greater long-term returns. Being a beancounter myself, and having been in the insurance industry for part of my career, I understand the complexities of trying to estimate claims reserves, especially as an entity goes into new markets. Having said that, we have had 2 years where we have had to make significant Q4 adjustments and the SEC will not tolerate that being a recurring matter. So hopefully they have gained the knowledge necessary to better estimate their reserves going forward and they will make appropriate pricing decisions in each individual market as they continue to grow the business."
they should reduce the management compensation and show that the shares are actually reducing. they buy the shares from the market and then generously award the management with the same. This needs to stop.

"Conditions are ripe for a squeeze here. Hurricane season is just about over, and the company still showed a decent profit after one of the largest storms in history ran right up the Gulf coast. Reinsurance tower worked as it should. In all probability we are at least 9 months from threat of another major weather event and company is continuing to diversify risk away from Florida. If you were short why would you continue to pay interest and dividends for that time period when the chance of bad news is so slim?"

UVE is up 5.06% to 30.20
Universal Insurance is up 4.98% to 14.54
Uve and Hrtg are great buys right now. EPS will continue up as the premium increase are earned and recognized. And with UVE there is a nice kicker. Half way through hurricane season without ANY in Florida. And who cares about hurricanes anyway? UVE has survived and thrived and grown through the best and worst of Mother Nature.I love these sorts of opportunities.
Does anyone see news for this mornings drop
"This is pure manipulation. Look at the volume, its so low. How can it tank 5% with such low volume?"
Management compensation is too high for a company like UVE. They need to get their act straight so that they don't miss like this. Very bad results. Hopefully they will hit 4.50 eps this year.
Another great day for UVE..
"If this was a tech stock, it would be up 5% minimum. $0.84 Beats $0.69 Estimate. Annual dividend 4.6%.Insiders own over 3 million shares."
"A few more hurricanes and storms will do wonders for this company. If the stock was so great, you would see insider buying instead of selling. The Chief Technology Officer only owns 3,117 shares. At least buy another 100 if you think the company will continue to prosper in the future."
Insider still dumping shares in September according to Yahoo insider. Very reassuring to investors.
