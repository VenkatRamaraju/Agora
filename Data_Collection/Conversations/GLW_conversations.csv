@Somarphous: Agree with what you said. I think Ford should buy Corning and have Farley run the company. Agree?
"From FattaThis is all that counts Analysts expected Corning to earn 58 cents a share on revenue of $3.632 billion.. Adjusted profit rose to 56 cents a share from 43 cents a share.THAT IS A MISS !!! 56 cents vs 58 cents. Punishment coming. Spank, spank!"
I am having trouble digesting this. Corning announces they are growing their fiber infrastructure adding 200 jobs and it goes down 1.50 in two days. They say the demand for fiber is very strong maybe they should raise their prices to AT&T and make some money. Something is wrong with the management at Corning they must be weak and easy to take advantage of. Same with the bottles for Covid must be selling them too cheap! Maybe they do not know inflation is everywhere and letting profits slip away. I am sure the workers are getting paid more how about increasing prices of the products! Weak management very weak!!
GLW looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"William KerwinAnalyst - MorningstarAnalyst Note | by William Kerwin Updated Oct 26, 2021We’re maintaining our $40 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Corning after the company reported third-quarter results that were in line with management guidance. Corning’s strong pace of revenue growth continues, but its profitability is still dampened by rising input and logistics costs. We maintain our expectations for robust top-line growth to continue behind secular tailwinds toward 5G and connectivity, as well as growing dollar content in end applications. With shares down more than 5% after the release, we believe the market is skeptical about Corning’s ability to grow the bottom line in pace with revenue. We think current inflationary pressure on margins will be short term and that Corning’s profitability will improve as it leverages its centralized cost advantage and uses its sticky customer relationships to pass on pricing increases. We view shares as undervalued and think the current price presents an increasingly attractive opportunity to invest in a diversified, excellent operator with long-term growth potential."
Good buying opportunity. Adding incrementally - in case it goes lower during this momentary blood bath.
"I'm just a little surprised at the current weakness in the SP and not sure what to make out of it, maybe manipulation is the only thing that comes to mind unless the inflationary costs hit GLW like a tornado in Q3.Recent News Updates:1) EPA registration of guardiant antimicrobial particles in paint - Think of all the hospitals, schools, airports train stations etc. that will use this paint.2) 4th quarter dividend announcement of $0.24, hoping for $0.27 first quarter 2022.3) $150 Million expansion of optical based on commitment from AT&T, similar to Verizon deal in 2017 and this is over and above the capacity already in place for the Verizon deal.The weakness amid all this news all but suggests that there is some manipulation to shake off the weak hands. Of course some of the weakness is coming from the market, but we had lost a lot of ground when the market was strong. 2021 YTD TR performance of GLW -> 4.35% vs S&P 500 -> 17%Not sure what it is but the company has no respect on the street and only time will tell who is right.We need solid Q3 results and Q4 guidance to shake us out of this malaise.Comments?"
from fattaSame old pattern!! Drive the price down before earnings. Someone knows how to manipulate the price and make money.
"Why haven’t we heard from all the cheerleading d-bags who defend this smoldering pile of dung, lol?!Surely, they’ll tell us how wonderful this stock is because of the dividend, and they purchased when it was much cheaper, while completing ignoring the fact of how poorly it typically performs even when the market is near record highs."
Should be a dividend announcement shortly..
"I do realize that GLW has underperformed the market in the last 4 months, but on the flip side I don’t see a single post on why GLW is a good value at ~$37 to attract new money. The usual trashing posts from investors who either bought at the recent 52 week high or in the single digits 20 years ago, who get their daily gratification from watching the stock price. What is not to like from a stock that is selling at a discount to the S&P, increasing dividend, strong growth ahead and the company buying back it’s own stock. Either use this opportunity to buy and recommend to friends and family to average in their positions or short the stock."
"Furthermore, in 20 years this stock has shown miniscule growth."
"""Sales reach all=time highs"" ""net income drops 13% shares fall""Above are the two headlines from today looks like more fiscal discipline is in order!Where is the money going from those increased sales to decrease net income 13%? Hope it's not increased compensation for management. Need new and better management for this great company!!More money coming in and 13% less profit can anyone explain it to me."
@Bizaritrino: Thanks. I agree but not sure if this company ever has a “true” breakout.
What do people think the price action will be after earnings? We seem to be stuck between 37-38.
anyone now concerned about year end tax selling and this going under $30 by year end? I've made money in all my investments except this one. Thinking of selling for a tax loss myself.
"from fattaThis says it allCorning isn't an exciting growth stock, but it provides a balanced way to invest in the long-term expansion of the mobile, optical, life science, and auto markets. Corning's end markets are cyclical, but its current growth cycle hasn't peaked yet -- and its dividends should continue rising for the foreseeable future."
I got out of GLW 2 years ago and was curious and checked today. Why would anyone invest in this yo-yo no-go same old same old stock.
ok glw time to stop going down. need to start heading up
Looks like cost of goods rose 14.7% cutting into margins. Finally they said they will be raising prices on goods sold. Jeez you think they would have started that sooner. Bring in some new blood at the top like Microsoft did and this stock will take off!
"Earnings = $0.56. So much for all my estimates of a climbing pps. lol Looks like we're headed for a rough day, week, month. C'est la vie."
A 24% haircut from the high!!
How about putting a couple of engineers in charge of the company instead of lawyers and MBAs. We might make some progress. With all the money spent on R&D where are the new products? How about some patents to products?
"From fatta,I have been kicked in the chops many times by GLW but I think this time hurt the mostIt should have been a blow out quarter! What a disappointment.By the way :The estimated Net Worth of Wendell P Weeks is at least $56.4 Million dollars as of 25 May 2021. Mr. Weeks owns over 100,000 units of Corning stock worth over $24,415,691 and over the last 17 years he sold GLW stock worth over $17,692,230. In addition, he makes $14,283,700 as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at Corning."
Nice volume! Over 6 million on the day and over 1.5 million in the last hour.
from fattaGLW is the stock with loveLOVE TO HATE!!!They need to get a new experienced CEO
"Down 20% off the annual high. I want to get back into GLW but, I wonder what is going to happen when the market enters a correction (which I believe will be within 6 months). I suppose I could dollar-cost average in however; I believe there is more short term down-side to up. Thoughts?"
"CORNING, N.Y., Sept. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced it is expanding its longtime collaboration with AT&T (NYSE: T). The two companies will work together to extend investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks, and accelerate 5G deployment. Based on AT&T’s long-term commitment to its network buildout, Corning is investing $150 million in optical cable manufacturing in North Carolina, initially adding 200 jobs."
"Corning Incorporated GLW is scheduled to report third-quarter 2021 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.9%"
Unbelievable! Got to get out of this stock at the next high - wonder how many years ?
"I haven't been in Glowworm for several years. Earnings miss while the market is hot is frustrating. But thinking of buying some if market weakens in the near term. It's still a very innovative company, which hasn't translated to huge earnings growth, but it's outlived several generations of tech and still kicking. Plus I loved visiting the museum, lol. Now that it is roughly flat on the year, may be time to think of accumulating, but since the market itself may need a breather, looking for the right moment to buy."
Weird how it fell more than the S&P on a day of Optical expansion. My feeling is that optical is sold out for at least 2-3 years if not more. Good thing is that a lot more cheap shares will be purchased at the end of the day tomorrow by DRIP. Another 2-3 million shares removed from circulation.
Isn’t Corning buying back shares…
"@HOBO: I am down about 1.7M with the boatload of GLW that I own. However. I believe we will rise to the low 40’s by years end, but not 50. If it reaches the old high or higher, I am definitely selling my larger blocks. It is a shame this stock is such a poor growth stock over the past 20 years."
"She's running up again .... be sure to own a ""boatload"" for that wonderful dividend before Nov. 10"
Pitiful performance as usual for today!!
"Read the earnings report what a joke first two paragraphs greeting and numbers than on the third paragraph he goes to the worst segment of the company talking about inflation and the weakness in the automobile industry and it's negative affects on the company. What a salesman it would be like a realtor showing a house to a client and once in the door saying oh here is a big leak in the roof before showing the house. He should have started out with the good segments of the company first leaving the autos for last. He started the stock drop on his third paragraph very negative thinker that is why we are stuck and Wall Street does not give us credit for all the good this company has. Great company, bad stock and very weak CEO who should retire. We need a corporate raider to come in and fix up this great company!"
This is pitiful! Did not think this would continue to drop.
This is terrible. Management needs replacement!
"Not sure if anyone noticed, but the vol. in the last hour on Friday was over a million shares."
