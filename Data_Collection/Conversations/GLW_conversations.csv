"COVID support, 5G ramp, growth potential, and dividend...what's not to like? Solid long term investment."
"I am starting to think diversification is stupid, and I should just buy 3 really good stocks and just accumulate, because I look at the 5 year trends for most companies (like this one) and growth is garbage compared to Apple, Amazon, etc. etc.."
"This stock never ran up with Apple when it ran to over $200 a share, but drops like a log when Apple reports bad news. This drop is a joke when you consider Cornings overall business. A drop of .40 or .50 a share would be fair but even that would be high."
"Bought more on today's weakness. The new Gorilla Glass, massive vial production for vaccines, US money for vial ramping, and improving TV and computer sales make GLW a stock I feel comfortable owning at this time. Good luck!"
Barron's just.came out with a favorable article on Corning saying glass for screens are in high demand and that the rest of Cornings business' are doing very well. The price was raised to over 50 in the article as well!
corning up almost a percent from the open 
Any news out there for the big drop today?
Zombie bottoming Wednesday. Next q is going to be great for inventory rebuild blowout rod per orders and inventory pull. Have a great day traders and longs just think of how nice this will be in the Great Expansion of 2021-2023
Corning has earned 40 to be its base. Solid company. Needed long term products and a rising dividend.
"From Fatta:Well, well, here we go folks. Same as always going down and down some more. Anybody starting to get what I have been saying?75% owned by institutions. They have learned how to make money doing this. Low volumes shares sold a low prices to down the price then high volume purchases at the low price to ride it back up to where it was.Neat! How they do this!"
"From Fatta,Sure makes me feel good about selling shares at $33 and $34 /share. I have seen this movie too many times. Nothing short of a major announcement will propel this stock."
I enjoy owning this stock. Great products and they are keeping up with technology if not leading in most all areas.
Well closed all calls and bought here what is the expression buy when blood in the street I expect a better weeks in July I have been wrong. Picked up another 600 so about 1700 shares so far sold the 40 strike for next week
"GLW got hammered today for no reason. All the fundamentals are in place, and they should remain so for the foreseeable future. Earnings are growing in just about all of their diversified product lines. Today's dip below $40 looks like a good entry point or a level to add shares. Unlike many other stocks, GLW has actual sales and earnings and a bright future. Good luck!"
"Where are the cry babies today!! Never see anyone posting on a day when GLW outperforms the market.Dividends also announced today!! Operation Warp speed, 5G acceleration, infratructure stimulus, rural broadband, IT spending for bandwidth, all trends looking good!"
"Wow! We broke 41 for a few minutes! I think Corning is finally be taken seriously for its product diversity, proven innovations, increasing dividends, and product trust and distribution. Long and strong since 2001. Corning has steadily grown into a solid, forward thinking, diverse company! Bravo!"
I thought 5th time was going to be the charm but looks like we will have another down day. Amazing how there are no buyers for a dividend growth stock selling at a discount to the market.
Someone bought 16 k 43 strike a couple weeks out calls. This is so they can take profits and buy options further out and reclaim calls in the money.
"Time for Corning to spend every bit of the buyback fund NOW! Maximize value for the shareholders, remove maximum number of shares at these Blue Light Special prices!"
Similar price action with others reporting today. That includes exceptional volume. Many 52 week lows are former highs of those particular days last year. This is probably mostly profit taking by big investors taking a little off the table to save on taxes and maybe buy a new car. Not worried. This is healthy long term.
Omg I can’t pass this up added 1500 sold 39 call for next week
"Deja Pooh, lol, and/or SSDD"
Optical guidance moved from up 10% to High Teens. Optical is the crown Jewel of GLW. The market will love these earnings. Corning IS delivering on all the things that said they would !!
"I will never understand how this stock performs. Will sell some stock at the next high, whenever that is."
"""maybe they are set to announce their new capital allocation plan which will be for $10B over 3 years and include 10% dividend raises and $5B stock buyback.""They literally announce that today (my guess from 2 days ago) and the stock goes down. I don't get this companyExpects growth investments to drive 6-8% sales and 12-15% EPS compound annual growth rates in 2020-2023Targets shareholder distributions of $8 billion to $10 billion, including annual increases in dividend per share of at least 10%"
A beat on revenue and a $.02 beat on EPS. They also provided guidance range for Q2 that is higher than analyst current estimates.~Bubba
Why doesn’t Corning get involved in the area of using coated glass to generate electricity and be used for window and facade on buildings and windows on cars and trucks?
glw looking real good. what is going on
"Do you remember how quick WW was to tamper down analysts' expectations and temper guidance downward just before the last earnings release. He seems to spend more time trying to woo the analysts and make them look good than taking care of his shareholders. I wish he would give a little more thought to discussing all of the future positive things going on at GLW ---- or at least give the negative and positive perspectives equal time. If he can't do it or doesn't want to, maybe he should consider engaging a good PR firm. I hope GLW is not all TVs. That's the past. Aren't we doing things with the automotive world, the building industry, the pharma industry, the communications industry, and maybe a few other areas as well. Share prices move up on long term perspectives. WW just concentrates on the ST ones that only appeal to in and out traders and not LT holders. Am I the only one that feels this way? I have been a ""too -long-holder"" for the return I got over 10 years. My patience is waning."
"from Fatta:New buy recommendation from BofA Merrill LynchKey reasons to BuyWe upgrade Corning from Neutral to Buy rating as (1) we view the growth profile asbetter than historical and more diversified, (2) Gross profit dollar growth should scalewith near term investments that are impacting gross margin rates, (3) glass pricingenvironment is a tailwind and could surprise incrementally to upside, (4) operatingleverage should help drive incremental margin expansion over the next few years, (5)opportunity to return incremental capital to shareholders through corporateactions/incremental debt, (6) Lower capital intensity for new initiatives given ability tore-use idle capacity (e.g. Gorilla Glass), (7) We expect a positive update at the upcominginvestor day in mid-June, and (8) Corning is significantly outgrowing declining unitgrowth in smartphones, TVs, Autos given its increasing content in each of these. Ournew PO of $40 (was $38) is based on 18x C20E EPS of $2.18. We view the pullback inshares yesterday (-6% vs SPX up 0.1%) as an especially attractive buying opportunity."
"Jeff, good info. I too read where Asiya Merchant raised GLW's price target to $42. It's about time GLW starts getting some respect. They already predicted they will do better than they estimated earlier, so their next earnings should be at or above the revised estimates. Good luck!"
"@Robert: I think anyone would bless what you have done and congrats...you have more than earned your right to hit the sell button@S: Unfortunate that you bought it at $46 as a trade...no one cares if you sellIMO, as you all have seen: I think the future is very bright for the end markets it serves. Think another overlooked part of there business is ownership interest in Hemlock Semiconductors that makes some of the highest quality and cleanest silicon and related chemicalsCorning was literally built for this era!"
Added 2100 shares
Excellent Q and a nice indication of a good up day for starters. The real meat is in the guidance forward. I am hoping that there is more meat than the premeal snack we’re seeing now.
"I love the volume. it speaks volumes. we should have a good upside until the Q1 reports come. If they continue to reflect growth, up we go. Stay strong all longs."
So if you're long $GLW and believe the story then the market has just given you an opportunity to buy in at a small discount. Expect weakness all day and maybe the rest of the week. I doubt the stock is going to $40 or below (until there is a market correction later in the year) so buy in and enjoy.
"From Real Money article: I like it ALOT!Meanwhile, Corning has continued to do what attracted me to shares in the first place -- returning capital to the shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. The company bought back $347 million in stock for the quarter and $2.23 billion in all of 2018. The buybacks decreased Corning's shares outstanding to 788 million, down 9% from last year and down nearly 50% from 2011.Since late 2015, Corning has returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through the combination of buybacks and dividends. It also has increased the dividend 50% during that time frame. Last year, the quarterly payouts were increased 16% from 15.5 cents a share to 18 cents; the prior year's dividend increase was nearly 15%. The question now is whether the company will increase the dividend this year, and if so, by how much?We should know as early as next week whether Corning sticks to the pattern of the last four years of increasing the dividend in February after keeping it steady for four quarters. Judging by the increases of the last couple years, one could expect the new dividend rate to be in the range of 21.5 cents to 22 cents. That would put the indicated dividend yield in the 2.6% range, up from the current 2.1%. Of course, whether there will be a dividend increase at all is conjecture at this point, but we'll know soon."
Nice change in volume recently and to the upside to boot!
"Much to my dismay, Nerdy CPA’s prediction of ""below $38 by end of this week,"" may prove true as we’re currently at $39.78.As mentioned previously, Corning is an excellent, innovative company, but a TERRIBLE stock to own; I rue the day I invested in GLW."
"Analysis Request from Corning Investors: Yesterday (March 29th) there was tremendous volume (8 plus million shares)rapidly going back and forth throughout the day with only a .1 cent loss at the closing while a 52 week high of 44.12 was reached as well. Corning ultimately held on tight to the $2 plus gains from the day before and the gains from the day before that. Today, except for a short, early rise, Corning was down most of the day until the last 1/2 hr. where it ended ""up"" .20 cents on the day at very, very low volume. Leaving the general market out of the equation for a minute, what are your opinions? I think professional moderate, and conservative investors are locking in their positions for growth and income for their investors and individual investors like myself are looking for less risky growth and income in the medium to long term as well. Meaning, I think Corning has earned the trust and respect by ""Investors"" to manage its success. stear through turbulance. innovate daily, and timely deliver quality, state of the art products to it's customers all the while giving back a nice, and yearly rising dividend. Buy hey, though I do my due diligence, I'm an optimist and a moderate risk taker in dividend generating stocks in general."
Wouldn't it be nice to close above the 52 week high today.!!!One hr left.
"Currently down more than 3% @ $41.84 – why?!GLW has been punishing shareholders lately, especially those such as myself who recently purchased additional shares at $46+Needless to say, I’ve been extremely disappointed, and now feel very foolish believing GLW would continue doing well, which hasn’t been the case at all."
"U.S. Departments of Defense, Health & Human Services select Corning Valor Glass packaging to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines"
"Been quiet off lately, last day today to buy shares for the $0.24 dividend on Sep. 29, we go ex-dividend on Monday. Other than that no news to pump up the stock price, just collect the dividend and sleep well!"
"Well, that's the thanks ya get for a good earnings report."
"I bought a sizeable position on today's dip. GLW is going to profit from all its segments, and it appears they will sell all the vials they can make. I don't know how much they make per vial, but they will be selling them for the foreseeable future. Covid vaccines will need multiple and then yearly shots, so GLW is definitely going to be selling all they can make. The 5G rollout is also good for profits as people are needing to upgrade phones and networks. I believe GLW said they are expecting at least an 8% growth in earnings, so I am expecting they are seeing even better things to come."
"Interesting start to the week GLW stock wise and Market movements. GLW has 11 trading days left before going ex-dividend on 5/27. The heavy volume (GLW and S&P) at open this am didn't look encouraging with GLW being down 2.59% vs SPY down 1.78%. GLW was knocking on $44/share and it looked as though we'd test the $43.50/share that GLW did buyback on 4/5. About 10:45am things turned and GLW caught support to finish the day -.22% but SPY closed -.89%, considerably lower.IMO, the stock has growth and finally seeing signs of dividend support paired with the growth. It will be an interesting follow the next 20 trading days as we head into and exit the ex-dividend date. Especially if Markets have downside pressure like this am.~Bubba"
I posted 2-3 months ago that I adjusted my avg. daily volume level to 4m. I'm adjusting it again to 3.6m (low 3.2m; high 4m). I don't think any more adjustments will be needed as the Samsung shares have settled in or finishing settling in for the stretch run. Long GLW.~Bubba
Volume was super high today but this stock is in fact a #$%$ I've had this for 20 years and am incredibly dissatisfied.
Take Heed….. nothing repeat nothing will over shadow the G7 and the meeting with Putin. Add to your positions. The Fed will take 2nd stage and nothing will change. No policy change you don’t repeat you don’t do anything to disturb the recovery that has started. This will not be a sell in May which Cramer was wrong again….. now he says in June then it will be July then August. The economy just starting to bloom you do not stop the recovery. GL to All
Volume so far is low especially for an earnings day. Doesn't seem like any strong commitment to the down play. Let's see how the day proceeds.
Exactly like I predicted 18 days ago!Corning announces moderate price increase for display glass in 3Q21.
"OK, I bought back in with 500 shares just below $38. GLW is in a sweet spot, and it does have a dividend coming within days. I knew it got ahead of itself yesterday with the Barron's article, but it is a great company with many cutting edge products. I don't believe the Barron's article said anything about their anti-bacterial paint additive which seems like a potential revenue generator as we will be virus conscience in schools, hospitals, and all public places.Today's give back didn't seem to have massive volume. So that is a good thing.Since I was sitting on around 3K shares, I wanted to take advantage of the pop. Now I will just sit back and let GLW ride. Good luck!"
"Corning Inc. GLW is planning to increase production of glass vials for COVID-19 vaccines by 50% from prior targets, after receiving more federal funding, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The glass maker is now expecting to produce 150 million vials this year, that will hold about 1.2 billion vaccine doses, the paper reported, citing Brendan Mosher, vice president and general manager of the company's pharmaceutical technologies business."
"It is difficult to determine what yahoos ideological dictates for posting on a financial board are, exactly. BY process of elimination, it appears that one can't point out that China officials decisively announced that there is no problem at the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant, as I predicted they would. GLW having many operations in China - a problem at a nuclear power plant would be of interest. It's a mystery why that is fails to conform with yahoo's ideological dictates for posting, but it does. No doubt they'll find this post ""nonconforming,"" too."
"I wouldn’t be surprised if Specialty Materials crosses 2B in annual sales in 2021. Looks like ceramic shield, gorilla glass and advanced optics are all experiencing explosive growth. If you’ll remember the investor presentation from 2019, goal was to reach 2B in sales by 2023."
could hit 43.00 after earnings
GLW is way underpriced. Conservative estimates for the near future are $45. GLW is both a industry and a technology company. It is in the best position that I have seen in the last 30 years. I predict that this security will be at least $62 by the end of the year perhaps even more.
"@S: Agree totally, but will only sell some. Do like the dividend."
It would appear today is going to be good. Barclay's upgraded this am form equal to over weight and PT from $31 to $44. The first half hour of trading we're up 3.73% banging on 52 week high and 1 million shares traded in first half hour. The volume is validating the move so it would appear a late day fade off an early move is less likely.Just my thoughts.~Bubba
"Wendell Weeks Share SalesCan someone shed light on CEO share sales after every quarter, like clockwork after every quarter results you see him selling.Is he exercising options that expire every quarter?"
GLW is a great company with strong earnings in many hot sectors. It pays a decent dividend and should offer long term benefits because it has real earnings and is not being pushed up by manipulation or hype. Good luck!
"We believed the upward trajectory hype, only to be fooled once again; sadly, when we were in the $46s two months ago, we didn’t know it would come crashing down into the $38s before long.I’m afraid to imagine how low this downward spiral will go, and what will happen when earnings are reported next month, especially since the PPS often drops sharply even when earnings exceed expectations."
"By my calculation, almost exactly 66% of currency hedge contract loss in Q1 has been recovered in Q2. This will be a significant boost to Q2 GAAP earnings. To the casual retail investor, this will appear to be a great quarter, just like Q1 was falsely perceived to be a very bad quarter. In the short term the stock market is a beauty contest, in the long run it is a scale. GLW is well position for significant growth and profit expansion."
@S: I have owned GLW for 20 years purchased between $1.60 and $5.50. Retired early with all dividends reinvested. I think it is time to sell some soon (170k shares)
"With the new tax rates, it's time to increase the dividend again. Let's go Corning and reward your shareholders."
"Increased vial production and stimulus checks hitting bank accounts. Watch big screen TV sales rocket, with GLW glass."
"Today’s low has already been $39.29, which is a loss greater than $1 compared to yesterday’s PPS, yet the cheerleaders respond as if these losses are rewarding shareholders."
"From FattaI am not so worried about dilution as most of you are.Let's clear up a few things:!- it will be a stock option of restricted stock No premature selling2- It is only in effect until Dec 20203- A $40,000 paycut amounts to less than 2,000 shares4- Managers, dept heads and exec's become owners of GLW stock and have a vested interest in performanceIn less than 1 month we now have 5 unit (segment leader's focused on their own unit (Not WW)More employees will have an equity position in the company and will benefit directly from performance From experience, I will tell you those employees will look at the GLW stock price multiple time a day because their ""skin is in the game""Just my opinion! We'll see what happens"
Added 60 to short this will fall into earnings even though this will be strong q
Let's put out some crazy optimistic numbers for the fun of it: (7 billion people) x (2 glass vials per person) x ($2 per glass vial) = $28 billion in revenue 
We have a pulse!!
"From Fatta:A serious question for other investors on this board:The company appears to be doing many right things so this question does not have to do with Corning performance.The question is how many of you are happy, satisfied or feel good about the stock performance? Only the stock performance. If not what do you think is the problem?I was thrilled with the quarterly report and was thrilled with the shareholder presentation but here we are again. It's like a magical yo-yo that goes up once and down 4 times.Maybe I am missing something and wonder what the rest of you think."
"Another upgrade from JP Morgan, price target $55. Looks like the analysts are finally waking up!"
"from fattamalle:WOW! Finally:Corning initiated with a Buy at UBS UBS analyst John Roberts initiated coverage of Corning with a Buy rating and $43 price target. The analyst cites the company's leading position in the roughly 10% of glass/ceramic applications as specialty materials. Roberts adds that Corning is continually reinventing itself as new applications replace older ones, with 8% R&D as a percentage of sales being the highest in his coverage. The analyst further states that there is ""no end in sight"" for growth in optical fiber used in 5G and data centers as well as LCD/OLED display glass."
"To all new Corning ""Investors"" this past year: I still believe 40 is our new base and that Corning is still fundamentally undervalued but knowing this stock as I do (I have visited Corning and spoke with workers and locals over the past 20 years) now more then ever I believe Corning is a solid Growth & Yield investment that I believe is now in a stable 40 to 50 trading range. Their products, balance sheet, outlook, increasing dividend, and innovative initiatives speak for themselves. But know this, Corning evolves and grows at its own pace based on research and societal needs they can actually improve. They don't waste their time and they are not a one-trick pony anymore. Those days are long gone! They presently have many common sense and proven,""New Economy"" ways to make money with ideas and innovations in the pipeline. But nobody is going to rush this company. That is the purposeful and upstate New York way. Slow and steady means quality control and they are not about to change that business philosophy now. Corning has earned its stripes to be looked at as a Growth & Income stock.All the early investors have always known this but the new investors need.to know the history. So if you are young, re-invest your dividends and add to your position when you can . If you are retired or need the money, take the dividends and hold your investment. But either way, to me, Corning is presently a buy and long term hold that is in a good trading range. Conservatively and long term speaking, IMHO, anything above 50 strengthens Corning for solid dividend increases and moderate growth long term. Still long and strong!"

Wow! After 20 years of owning this stock patience is paying off. I do think we will see 45-50 this year!
This stock gets no respect from Wall Street. Just don’t understand why down or little movement past two trading days with market up???
"Interesting. Twice I've posted my opinion that Corning stock may have gone down due to the administration's and the big 3's as well as other automakers goal of 50% EV production by 2030 because it would affect Corning's Catalyst sales. And twice, the comment has disappeared. Is it being censored? just an opinion, and hardly out of bounds compared to other looney stuff posted not even related to GLW stuff being posted."
hoping for 45.00 by middle of August.
"This is actually the first time in a long time that I’m not worried about the dip, for a couple of reasons.1) The yield at 55% over the S&P 500 becomes more attractive as the price dips and buyers will appear as it gets more attractive and not to forget 10% div. increases in 2022 and 2023. 2) Tony is waiting on the sidelines hopefully scooping up shares. If Samsung deal was done now the share count would have been further reduced by 4M shares.3) They’ve learnt their lesson from the last optical build out that there will be no capital investment for any one customer unless cash is received upfront. Eg. Apple, Uncle Sam4) No build capital required to meet sales target thru 2023, meaning a lot of free cash flows to further buyback shares and increase dividend. 5) No real pricing pressure as demand exceeds supply in all businesses, only negative is exposure to increased operating costs due to inflation.6) All growth drivers firmly in place, part of the selling is obviously market driven but others selling are probably cashing out to pay for other bets gone wrong. In fact I’ve been telling my friends to average in their Corning position if they have cash on the sidelines."

"OK, I'll keep this simple. 5G is a must have and I am in the business of installing fiber for all of the major companies. we MUST have an unimaginable amount of small cell sites in place to accommodate this because 5G only goes 1640ft from site to site. there is an unbelievable amount of fiber that has to be placed in the air and underground to make all of this happen. Trust me when I say that we are not even close in the United states of having this fiber in place. Cable companies, phone companies and many other service providers have a ton of work of getting the backbone and infrastructure built to make 5G happen. THAT is the reason they say it will not be fully completed until 2025. each of these sites must be fed with a fiber optic cable and this has not even come close to being done. Corning better really get geared up because there is still thousands of miles of fiber to get installed. It is not the technology and it is not the equipment, It is a matter of getting it all in place and installed!!"

"Following this stock for so long, one thing I noticed is GLW would frequently (not always) trade at about the 2x the Nasdaq. If the Naz was up 2%, good chance GLW moved up 4%. Todays GLW (major player in 5g and heavy Covid revenue outlook) is trading around 2x the Dow.

With a pending selloff in the tech sector, nice to know Corning won't trade with it at 2x!"

It seems like every day there are new recommendations for companies that participate in the new 5G network but not one mentions Corning. Pretty sad!Maybe Corning's management does not feel like they have a positive story to tell.I hope that you are all happy but I told my portfolio adviser that this is the last year for me with GLW..One way or another, I will be out this year except for the shares that I will leave for my kids.Down a half a buck on this historic day!"

"GLW to $100! What can I say, my specialty is making spectacular things happen. I am like AI, I know exactly the buttons to press in the matrix of existence to get things done. GLW will revisit its DOTCOM bubble highs, soon!"
we thinking good numbers tomorrow morning?
What is everyone’s opinion as to why we are down so much? I just don’t understand the reason. Glad I have no purchased any shares the past 3 months. Thanks.

"I see more valor glass vials being sold, more gorilla glass for phones,tv's and EV's sold, more 5G cable sold, and more diesel filters sold two to 5yrs down the road plus new products brought to market along the way. In my view, I feel Corning like utility stocks will be a good hedge against inflation if there is inflation, while also providing growth . Companies are now relying on Cornings products for the integrity and quality of their own products. Whats a product with out Gorilla Glass, or Valor Glass, or 5G cable? An inferior product. If Corning is heavily sold into this earnings call it will only be a buying opportunity for others so I still feel we are in a 40 to 50 buying range. Once we get past 50 and hold there (this year or next) I think Corning enters a new league with a solid base to grow from. Investors are paying attention so It will be interesting to see how the economy grows into 2022 and beyond while Corning grows and evolves at its own pace."
"Can anyone offer an explanation, given market highs? Thanks."
"""Saying that the fiber build and improved display pricing make Corning's (NYSE:GLW) long-term targets achievable, JPMorgan upgrades the company from Neutral to Overweight and raises the price target from $39 to $55.""""Chatterjee now says Corning's once ""seemingly aggressive"" targets of 6-8% revenue growth and 12-15% EPS growth will be achievable through to 2025, warranting a premium valuation.""That's what I was looking for, the sustainability (FY2025) to justify it's not a one and done. Also, the premium valuation is warranted. With those 2 items mentioned, hopefully other analysts will follow suit in the weeks ahead. The market, macro, or other events pull back will result in the dip being bought. GLW has had some short term runs FY14, FY17 but the dip was seldom bought.Just my thoughts.~Bubba"
"Poor performance again today, and unfortunately, for the most part, this has been the pattern since reaching its 52-week high on April 26th. The decline has been ~ 8% since; will this pattern continue, and if so, how low will it go?"
"Well, the results are precisely what they stated they would be months ago. It was already baked in. But, facts never seem to matter to the market when it comes to GLW. The word ""idling' is a good choice of words. A lot of speculation on companies that will/could potentially profit from 5G has grossly inflated the P/E of several, but fiber optics is required for the last mile (unless one plans on standing in line of sight with a pole)...and for all intents and purposes, the rubber hasn't hit the pavement on the road to 5G, yet. The question is, will 5G actually ever be installed to any significant degree? I am guessing - yes, but no one knows at what rate. The current rate is amebic...and GLW is now joined at the hip with that rate of implementation. Meanwhile, the market just loves super devices, connectors and chips that have very few places to go - yet. And, the market appears to think they'll be good for something other than a paperweight. Yep, it isn't just glw that is idling … waiting for a reason to put that engine into gear - they are just the only one punished for 5G's current near non-existent expansion rate."
"Earnings was good but is this what's dragging it down? These particular categories? I am new to GLW so just wondering. [Sales were up 4% year-over-year in display technologies, which mostly supplies television manufacturers. The company said that price declines “were moderate” in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 10% in optical communications, off 5% in environmental technologies, and down 13% in life sciences.Corning didn’t provide fourth-quarter financial guidance.]"
"Looks like GLW is going to get the Barron's Bounce today. The article I read was quite positive, and it pointed out that GLW has a lot of irons in the fire going forward. It is about time that a real company with real earnings is getting noticed."
what is going on with glw
As we approach earnings would like to get opinions on price action post earnings. I’m hoping that we will trade over $22 after earnings.
"From Fatta:B of A ResearchCorning Inc. (GLW)Our price objective for Corning is $38 and is based on 22x our 2021E EPS of $1.70. Thismultiple compares to historical range of 10x-24x, with median 15x. We feel our choice ofmultiple balances near term gross margins pressure vs. longer term share gains in LCDglass. We also remain positive based on use of Gorilla Glass in new end markets(including automotive), and a strong capital return program.Upside risks to our price objective are better adoption of Gorilla Glass, better thanexpected TV unit and area growth, upside from recovery in the heavy truck business, andupside from stronger telecom demand. Downside risks to our price objective are anunexpected slowdown in TV sales, glass supply/demand becoming unbalanced due tomore than expected supply coming online, Corning's customers cutting utilization ratesmore than expected thereby reducing demand for LCD glass substrates, and higher thanexpected CapEx investments."
Corning Up Premarket 4%.Credit Swiss Tech Conference today with update.Fourth Qtr Sales to grow 5 to 8% sequentiallyOperating Margin expected to grow at approx DOUBLE the rate of sales sequentially..Waiting for this run for a LOT of Years.Just Beautiful.!!!!!GLTA...
I am surprised we have not gotten any upgrades or PT adjustments. Apple came out with earnings last night and already there are numerous upgrades and adjustments.
how is that a profitless company like doordash can have a marketcap 2x of corning..... a company with so many amazing technologies and innovations.??? what am i missing???
bought 1000 shares going long for GLW corning are excellent company to Hold.
"from Fatta:This could be huge!Corning Guardiant Antimicrobial Particles Enable Paint and Coatings Demonstrated to Kill More Than 99.9% of Bacteria and Viruses, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Two Hours or LessUnder test methods approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), paint and coatings containing Corning Guardiant were shown to kill more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2, THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.Corning is working alongside PPG as it seeks EPA registration for its paint product formulated with Corning Guardiant."
hopefully we hit 43.00 next week
"Is the hoarding of cash what’s keeping GLW from moving higher?After reading the earnings report and an optimistic Qtr 4 and 2021, what is it? It almost seems like the business perfect!"
"well,well,well here we go again"
No Diamond Hands the hedges and option traders are trying to make some Mula today let’s see if the swing it back above 42. Now that would be a sign of real hard core traders. If not just minnows in the pond. Good luck long for eps
"The market is up, and GLW is down, as usual; as mentioned previously, same reaming, different day, lol"
"An I wrong? Vaccine bottle sales have added little to earnings, and we haven't seen a huge boost to GLW's earnings from coronavirus vaccines. Am I wrong? "
"what lovely person/shop loves hitting that sell button at the market open and close??? Hey buddy, the fundamentalists won't let you blow up the technical picture to create a deeper selloff...look at the open and closing in regards to previous days close and it seems like they are trying soo hard lolhow much more positive news can this stock get to move back towards its recent highs? Surely we can break out of this range!"
"Can't figure why GLW has languished lately. With the the specialty glass shortage, virus fighting paint formulation, competitor's production problems, and government funding for increased production capacity, I would think the stock would have at least held its own. It also projected higher growth a while back, so they will most likely have decent earnings. Maybe they should have kept the good news to themselves and surprised the market at earnings. Then again, maybe they left a little good new up their sleeves. At least they have decent earnings and interests in many important product lines. Good luck!"
"Feels nice to have a good day, and wish we had more. I'm especially anxious and concerned about next week's earnings; perhaps we'll be fortunate, and we won't suffer the usual sharp decline."
So I think they can start buying back stock again tomorrow. Should give some support to the stock
"I sold 40% of my holdings of GLW yesterday on the pop, and I bought it all back today under $38. I really like GLW's prospects, but I thought yesterday's jump was exaggerated due to the coming dividend. I played it safe, and just sold part. I expect GLW will move over $40 in the next month or two, so I wanted to keep my position. Good luck!"
I bought a couple of hundred shares more under $37. The company beat earnings and is predicting above estimate earnings for next quarter. It is raising its dividend 9% for this quarter. Barron;s had a analyst this week who raised price target to $44 on strong prospects. I can't think of a better bargain than GLW at these levels. I have no idea why anyone would want to dump shares at this price and just before getting the dividend. Just my thought. Good luck!
I think the analysts' price targets are too conservative on this company. I honestly see GLW going a lot higher from here due to the high demand for their products. I invested several weeks ago for that very reason and already have a 22% return. My price target honestly is in the 60-70 range. We will see how it plays out but one thing I'm certain of is that this name has more room to run from here.
meh results but selloff does not make sensesequential sales fall-off is not good. bought 1000 at $31.50 in pre-market with orders at lower prices
"This happens often and that's why were 15% off our all time high, it makes no sense to drop on a day like this."
"All things considered, I now deeply regret purchasing additional shares at $46+, and wish I had sold my shares rather than purchasing more; alas, another GLW lesson learned the hard, expensive way."
"from Fatta:Zacks has changed their tune, This should help!With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock appears to be a solid investment option at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.I can't remember the last time Zacks had a ""buy on Corning.Also, Corning has 60 job openings in Big Flats NY."
I just wish on day we go UP $6 in a week instead of down. Anyone think will ever happen?
Corning is ready for a dramatic upswing in earnings due to the current glass shortage.
"from fattaBank of america---Corning Inc.Fundamentals remain sound despite macroweaknessReiterate Rating: BUY | PO: 34.00 USD | Price: 30.24 USD Estimates move higher, PO to $34 (from $26)From S & P Global:CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINIONON SHARES OF CORNINGINCORPORATEDWe raise our 12-month target by $2 to $33, 19.5x our 21 EPS estimate at $1.69, comparable topeers, reflecting our view that conditions have begun to improve in a number of end markets We think GLW is well-positioned to weather Covid-19, with capex cutin half in Q2 and production levels in line with demand.From Morningstar:Stewardship Ut Oh WendellMark Cash, Eq.

However, we believethis type of power concentration is far from ideal andwould prefer the roles of chairman, CEO, and presidentnot be tied to just one person. That said, we appreciatethe diversity, independence, and significant expertise ofthe rest of the board."
"I wonder why analyst's only project out only 1 to 2 years for Corning, when there are a lot of upcoming technologies and markets where Corning will be a major player because of their size, scale and commitment to research and innovation.Why don't analyst's put any value on quantum communications, carbon capture, glass and ceramics in Li-ion batteries, EUV and the list goes on....Clearly the analysts don't understand the growth potential of this company, wise and patient investors on this board should take advantage of the dislocation in valuation."
"1.40 Swing today in share price. Do they (MM) play us like a fiddle or what.?Hey Bubba, can you quantify GLW's exposure in China? % of manufacturing, sales, etc. Heavens Forbid, If China blows up & decides to invade Taiwan, that's gotta be a game changer for the US & the World. Especially all the American Companies Manufacturing over there. Can't imagine the Impact.!!Doubt if the Corpse in Charge will do any retaliation. Just not very optimistic on the World View of things.Any clarity would be appreciated...GLTA"
@Corning2retire:Triple digits?? Are you kidding? I have not sold any shares/dividends since 2001 but will be happy with 50 for now.
"Folks, continue to watch the volume, it says it all. Looking very strong at this point and that should continue. Good luck longs."
.53. or higher tomorrow
"EU are to pay #$%$15.50 for per vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna, wonder what % of that is being paid to Corning for their specialist vials..."
With a trailing PE of 38 and a Forward PE of 17 what more do you expect? This has never been a high growth stock and it’s future has always looked bright but their ability to deliver consistently increasing profits has been spotty so my expectation is $44 by year end and I am okay with that being a long term holder.
"At the end of the last quarter, the CFO said they expected a strong quarter to end the year. Sounded good to me then, and it still does now. With their anti-microbial paint, $15 million dollar investment from the gov., vial production, gorilla glass, auto emission glass, TV and phone screens, etc., GLW seems to be in all the sweet spots. We shall see tomorrow. This market does not act like us old time investors would expect, so I am ready for anything. Good luck!"
2021 EPS estimate: $2.50PPS with a PE of only 20: $50Let us give thanks!
Ex dividend 11/15today is the last day to capture the dividend
Corning is showing real strength on Friday I held the 42 options and as it rose bids jumped into the 100s with nobody selling. I see 45 by the EOW and steadily climbing past that in the coming weeks. Hold and buy this may be the safest stock in the market IMO
With TV display glass being Corning’s largest most profitable business and most flat screen TVs reaching their 10 year upgrade cycle and the holiday season forecast to be the largest EVER AND Corning management saying “this is the best pricing environment we have seen in 10 years” AND Corning having just opened a new glass factory for TV glass.... Does anyone think this is not going to be a GREAT End of the year for Corning? Ask yourself how old is your TV? What will it take for you to upgrade it to a 65 inch screen that uses much less power and only costs $800? How close are you to a new TV this year ? GLW to 45 by February 2019! (Right after Q4 earnings).
"Seems like investors/traders/society wants instant gratification.....Following any hype. The more hype the better.Too bad GLW doesn't fit in this category, but I own it anyway as a stable holding/div."
yeah might be pennies in front of a steamroller...but holly guacamole just out of the money weeklys when this thing has basically been preprogrammed for this trading range...be careful but glw is a loaded spring right now 
$15mm award from DoD and HHS to tool up for production of swabs used in Covid 19 testing by robotics.That's the gov't reaching out and saying we can't get enough of these and in the past you guys have come through for us.Here's some cash to push our needs to priority in your production chain.No guidance about how big a market swabs are and what kind of margin to expect.Could just be a drop in the bucket but never hurts to be on the DoD's speed dial.Tried to post the link but it kept failing.
"Typical of GLW board, no one has anything to say when GLW outperforms the market 4X!"
"It’s funny how some of the other msg. boards like TSLA have thousands of messages every day and GLW less than a hundred/week, quietly outperforming the market and at multi year highs. Every time we post a new high, I see msgs. from newbies. GlW is flying high below the radar."
"We were all hoping for $1.00, makes sense to be prudent as the pandemic is still in the drivers seat. Hope to see $1.08 for 2022!"
"Definitely forgot about the preferred conversion and JP Morgan timed the downgrade right around the conversion deadline of Jan 15, 2021 or 25 days above 35 within 40 trading days before 7 years. Samsung will be forced to sell ~36M shares to stay under the 9% threshold after conversion. GLW will be under pressure in the short term with the dilution sale. Not sure if Corning can cough up 1.26B and buy the 36M shares in a private transaction. I wonder if that was the reason we never shot past $35 in the past and not sure what to make of it right now. Comments or thoughts from other investors are welcome."
Filled a lot of gaps today…..
"One year ago, $31. Today $41. Next year $55. Steady as she goes......"
"@ David F: I can accept and understand reasonable dips/fluctuations according to the market; however, losing 20% in a short period of time is entirely unacceptable.While GLW may be an excellent company, it’s proven to be a TERRIBLE investment. The cheerleaders who continue to justify, and/or rationalize the recent, tremendous losses are obviously in denial and refuse to confront the facts and reality ."
Collecting cheep shares for the dividend on the 26th raised 9% to .24 a share we should start moving up next week.
Reasonable growth from a semi-industrial company with a dividend. Pick your entry point carefully but GLW remains a buy.
we will be fine
"From FattaI have to admit that I am totally surprised that during this horrible market correction period, GLW has held fairly steady compared to the most. I experienced big losses in many of my holdings this year gut GLW was the portfolio anchor. This is the most positive sign for GLW that I have in a very long time.I have been critical in the past but the steadiness has given me hope that the battering of GLW has stopped.We'll see over time."
from FattaCornings innovation for Mercedes Benz. Pretty awesome. https://youtu.be/FBLVSxXcTuE
The current one year trend line has Corning above $50 before this time next year. Just sitting patiently. Thank you.
"Is there any doubt that GLW is ""best of breed"" in their area? This is (finally and at long last) one I held on to. Should be a great keeper,"
GLW is reportedly getting $57 million to increase vial production. No wonder GLW is bouncing back again. This company is loaded with options and a host of products that are in great demand.
Tomorrow's earnings report.
"Huge deal for GLW. Buys 3M optical division for $900M. $400M in sales, 500 employees,accretive in 2019 7c-9c. Deal will close sometime in 2018.Stock up in the pre-market. This looks like a great deal. Didn't overpay. Fiber division is hitting on all cylinders and probably needed to add more capacity. They just bought more capacity."
Over the years I have bought 249 shares with an investment of approx. 4k. Through div reinvest I now have 313+ worth over 11K. I can not complain.
"Minus $1.27 today, and ~ $8 in less than sixty days, and yet the cheerleaders vote thumbs down when I express my disappointment in GLW, and respond as if we've been doing well.As mentioned previously, Corning is an excellent company, but a TERRIBLE stock to invest in, unless you’re a glutton for punishment, and enjoy losing money."
Remember Team they want it cheaper you are long term dividends increase in share price and wealth. The future of earnings isn’t in question they have a very positive outlook don’t let the noise get to you. This will have at least a 10-15 percent share price increase by eoy. Next year all cylinders go. This will be 50-63 dollar stock.
glw raised price of display screens and buying back shares that's a positive 
More on the way. Tony mentioned Q1 2021 is looking strong and eps of $.40-$.44 (double Q1 2020). He stated it's the low end of the range for Q1 (analyst had $.39 for Q1 2021). The numbers are going up.
"This is a viable investment. The Navarro statement simply repeated what was stated back in June. Corning is a key government backed player for numerous Pharmaceuticals to increase glass vial availability for vaccine production. Now if Trump references GLW, we may get a jump in the sp; otherwise, the news may be already baked in. However, this all adds up to a bright future atop of already solid company, IMHO."
This is a joke and should be looked into.
"@James Thanks for your understanding. In reference to your comment, “I bought in 5 days ago and it's been nothing but a download train,” I share your pain, as I increased my position in GLW near the 52-week high of $46.82, only to realize staggering losses ever since as we’re currently at $39.36.How could anyone who has been losing thousands of dollars daily after investing in GLW feel good about owning the stock? The “cheerleaders” who vote thumbs down on my honest assessments obviously aren’t admitting the reality of the situation, and are just “shooting the messenger” for revealing a difficult truth which they aren’t willing to acknowledge."
One product that may shine in the future is Corning's exhaust systems. The corona quarantine offered an unprecedented look at the World with a huge reduction of cars. The C02 dropped dramatically but particulates did not due to truck exhaust. This amplified the need to improve in this area if we truly want to clean up the air.https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/environmental-technologies/life-is-breathtaking.html
"So what I am seeing is that we have new life with tailwinds pushing past previous all time highs with strong potential moving forward. It’s not about where the puck has been but where it is going regardless of past performance, we are today stronger and better positioned for the push forward to what is relevant in todays world and ready to take what should and will be ours... buy and prosper."
"It's all good boys and girls. The market can do what it wants for now. GLW's business is excellent. The price has moved up enough for the time being, it'll trend upwards as time goes on."
"I almost doubled my position on today's dip. With the virus totally out of control, GLW will sell all the vials it can make. The glass for 5G, phones, TV's etc. should also do well as we once again have to hunker down. To me GLW benefits from the virus issue. Hopefully vaccines will be available as soon as possible."
"Wow! This was announced on March 26, surprised no one posted it....Corning is announcing a moderate increase to its display glass substrate prices in the second quarter of 2021.This price adjustment is a result of increased costs in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses during the current glass shortage. Additionally, the costs of precious metals required for maintaining reliable glass substrate manufacturing have risen significantly since 2020. While Corning has sought to offset these added costs with productivity enhancements, it can no longer fully absorb them.Corning expects glass supply to remain short-to-tight in the upcoming quarters and will continue to partner with customers to maximize our glass supply to them."
I love everyone's exuberance but fridays volume speaks volumes to the legitimacy of this move and the next big move up. Good luck to all who have been around since the early 2000's.
"It seems that no company, no matter how big the ER blowout, can hit the ""whisper number"" that goes with every quarterly report in a bull market like this. I'm seeing it with virtually all my holdings. They will all recover because the companes are sound."
Don’t listen to same person with multiple ids posting those posting downside in this boom cycle are working for the SYSTEM and are Hedgy short
"Nice to see GLW performing well, and would be thrilled if it continues after tomorrow's earnings; however, I'm sure everyone is concerned it may fall, as it has done many times in the past.Hoping for the best ..."
"From Fatta:Does anybody remember this?CORNING, N.Y. -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), a leading manufacturer of fiber-optic technologies used to create the world’s communications network, announced today that its board of directors has approved a three-for-one stock split of its common shares.“Our decision to split the stock reflects our confidence that we are firmly established in markets that will continue to grow well into the next decade,” said Roger G. Ackerman, Corning’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Our position as the world’s leading manufacturer of optical fiber gives us a unique ability to co-design fiber and optical components that both increase the carrying capacity of the network and decrease the cost of transmission. We will exploit this competitive advantage by continuing to develop a rapid succession of new products through a combination of internal innovations and external acquisitions.”As of June 30, 2000, Corning had approximately 319 million common shares issued.Do you wonder why the market doesn't like GLW"
"From Fatta:Good news from Barrons.Barron#$%$ And Pans: Chevron, Corning, GlaxoSmithKline And MoreIn ""Corning Shares Could Gain More Than 25%,"" Leslie P. Norton makes a case that Corning Incorporated shares could rally as demand grows for the company's optical fiber, LCD-panel glass and Gorilla Glass. Its shares have marched higher for the past two years, but see why Barron's thinks its prospects look even brighter as the company's new businesses bear fruit."
"Well, it dropped more today, so I tripled my 500 shares. I think the company is just too good to give back just about all of the momentum it gained from the great Barron's article. I am not seeing a large amount of volume, so I think GLW is definitely a good long term play that will let you sleep at night. I hope I am right.Hey, on a bright note, my wife and I got our second PFE vaccine shot today. Because of the snow in the NE, we left early and got there at the open. The line was long, but we were happy to get the shots. A friend of our said they returned home because they heard that the site was closing due to the snow. Bummer. I shoveled my large driveway as much as I could just in case I feel crummy tomorrow.Stay safe!!!"

Is the world ending and we didn’t get the memo…??? ;)
glw a stock you want to own forget about it and collect the dividend . why isn't anyone talking about what will propel glw to 50.00.. ?? I've only just started a position. was lucky to get 1/3 yesterday at 27.07 .anyway this company makes. one of the most important piece of the 5g build out .. 5g can't build out without this what is it ?
from Fatta:something is going on when GLW is up in a down market day. The volume is not high and it was in positive territory all day. let's keep an eye open.

"from fattaStock futures gain as Pfizer gives upbeat update on coronavirus vaccineNow, remember this:Merck and Pfizer Collaborate with Corning to Modernize Pharmaceutical Glass PackagingAs a result of Merck and Pfizer’s commitment to improving glass quality and promising results from their initial testing, Corning is making an initial investment of $500 million and creating 1,000 new U.S. jobs as the first part of a planned investment of $4 billion and 4,000 new high-tech jobs."
Anyone have a real answer why this stock got pounded today on no news I could find ??? Any real answers
"At the last earnings report, GLW said how good they were doing on all product lines. They said the forecast would continue to be positive, and they mentioned how they had upped there glass content to around $100 per car. With the economy heating up and people continuing to upgrade phones, TV's, laptops, etc. I can't see any reason for GLW's fundamentals to slide. In fact, GLW said they were in the sweet spot of their R&D as they were not having to spend a great deal on developing new products. I already have a few thousand shares, but if I didn't, I would be buying this dip. As far as the nuclear reactor issue in China, I doubt that is a big deal. China may be secretive, buy the rest of the world has the ability to detect radiation leaks from great distances. We can also see what is going on at the ground level there, so I am sure things must look normal from above. Hey, I may be wrong, but unless something else is hurting GLW, I don't think the known variables are anything but positive. Good luck!"
Wow. Samsung Corning news re: shares owned. GLW is buying the 35m shares (4% of outstanding shares) to take Samsung down to 9% level and Samsung agreed to hold common shares for another 7 years. Transaction to take place by end of April 2021.The price is going to move today with this news and the job report over the weekend.~Bubba
"from FattaBofA SecuritiesF3Q rev grows high-teens q/q ex Hemlock transactionCorning recently announced that F3Q sales are expected to grow by low-teens percentq/q driven by strength in its Specialty Materials and Environmental segments. This ishigher than our/Street prior expectation of high-single-digit growth q/q. In addition,Hemlock redeemed DuPont’s 40.25% ownership, which increases Corning’s ownership to80.5%. So instead of having equity earnings from Hemlock, Corning will consolidate itsrevenues and earnings. Corning’s EPS for F3Q is expected to grow more than the Streetestimate of 30% q/q. We expect near-term demand for Gorilla Glass to remain strong asnew smartphones and tablets are released in the fall and also expect Environmental tokeep benefiting as customer automotive plants ramp back up, and given increasedadoption of gas particulate filters (GPF). Free cash flow is expected to be positive forF20. We reiterate our Buy rating on glass supply/demand balance, glass price declinesremaining moderate, increased adoption of Gorilla Glass and upside from increasedadoption of GPF in vehicles with additional optionality from Valor Glass (pharma usecase)."
"Corning is the perfect stock: a tech stock plus a coronavirus stock, with no risk of its lunch being eaten by some other company. It will be making the vials for the vaccines, so no matter who gets to the top in the coronavirus vaccine competition, Corning is a winner. It supplies the glass for smartphone screens and, again, Corning comes out a winner no matter which smartphone maker gets to the top. It is providing things for 5G, which is a technology growing exponentially. Right now, I peg Corning only second to TSLA."
The MACD has bottomed out and we have a bullish cross on the ADX not to mention the 100day crossing the 200 on the hourly chart in the middle of July consolidation after earnings after a slight drop has been the norm for most after earnings so I see this continuing the uptrend. IMO this is a strong buy here and expect to fill the gap at 34 sooner than later...
"It is difficult to post a Barron's article for some reason. The main point I got from the article other than what we know about GLW's business segments and opportunities was the fact that it chief competitor, Nippon Electric Glass had a fire or some kind of incident at a major production facility that affected their production ability. I went to the Nippon site, and there is a letter to shareholders explaining the problem and the uncertainty of when they will be able to resume production. They seem to imply that there is a possibility that it could impact earnings for 20 and possibly 21. I tried to post the letter but it was removed. Check it out for yourself. I believe that was the reason for the upgrade and the Barron's article."
"GLW did well for a brief while, and we were all thrilled when each day brought new highs.Unfortunately, the tide has shifted, and each new day now brings dread and new lows; as mentioned previously, the cheerleaders aren’t willing to acknowledge the reality, and their denial of the truth continues."
"Corning plays up the 5G potential of it's stock and I think many investors who hold GLW believe same. The disconnect is that whenever I read an article about companies to invest in to ride the 5G wave, GLW is never listed. The most recent article named Nokia and Ericsson, as well as Micron, but no mention of GLW. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-poised-benefit-141149143.html"
To the Moon!!!! I expect news on the vaccine will boost corning in the coming months...
I reiterate that GLW is second only to TSLA in the stock market. The current earnings report proves it.

"What would be happening if they didn't have $5 billion to buy the stock back. Is there any ""buy back"" buying now pursuant to the program or do they expect the price to trade lower? I am a very GLW-positive, long-term holder. Just a little disappointed with the price action. ."
"nice organic price action. This is actual buying, not the company buying back stock."
hi all. Is anyone worried about the high payout ratio? It is 65% in June 2021! thanks
"Looks like GLW has bounced back from the sell-off. It dropped at the end of the day as some fund or funds just dumped thousands of shares. It beats me why they would do that as GLW has solid prospects, accelerating earnings, and a decent dividend. Maybe they wanted to buy Bitcoin or something. I bought another 300 shares on the dip. GLW may bounce around a little, but it is a true company with solid fundamentals that you can buy and still sleep at night. Good luck!"
Melt up to 4400 plus on tech growth cycle starts to expand. The inflation news isn’t what is moving the market. The hedges who are losing on their market short position. They have tons of sideline cash to put to work. This will top out in the 50s. Buy Sept.
"huge business coming to GLW from APPLE,$40 a share this fall then $50's next year"
"Well, 5G didn't roll out as quickly as once believed it would. Local, fed and state regulations contributed to that. Now that whatever nightmarish paperwork and palm greasing that required is at least known territory, things are humming along and the demand for fiber for the ""last mile"" should continue to increase. I think $42 for GLW in the next 6 months is very realistic."
Corning Reorganizes under New COO.Check Out Seeking Alpha
"I've been thinking about the many reasons that Corning could be exhibiting weakness and the only thing quite frankly jumps out is inflation. With so many plants, manufacturing, raw materials, supply chain logistics etc, GLW is a little more vulnerable to inflation than some other companies say like Microsoft or Google. The good thing is that the factories are running at capacity and that helps with the fixed costs being spread out over a higher volume of products. Comment/thoughts are welcome..."
"Value for shareholders. That is exactly what Corning delivered as they have been executing the buyback program. Too bad they didn't spend an additional $1B buying back shares in the 20's. As profits surge moving forward, nice to know that the buyback program will continue to deliver spectacular value for us shareholders! Nice to know the dividend will continue to see increases. Don't forget to reinvest those divy's friends!"
Question for the board. After spending gazillions opening up factory after factory in China is thereAny chance Corning can some way start to divest itself from manufacturing in China.?Bring it back to the states.Will Apple ?Do these companies see thru the same lenses that Apple Pie Americans see thru.?
"On first blush, Corning's earnings look stellar."
Got to go to work. Don’t sell calls any cheaper than 43-44 this is going to fly with the Fang and growth pop especially with next Q eps I think they blowout and do maybe .61-63
Could GLW also be an infrastructure play with fiber optic cable and connectivity products?
"Just added another 1k shares. I read the earnings release and every segment was firing on all cylinders. There was a $50 hit for logistic costs that the company plans on remediating. The company is in some key sectors and growth is predicted to continue and accelerate. GLW will probably buy back more shares and possibly increase the dividend. Comparisons for last year in the coming quarters should be a slam dunk. Hey, GLW has had a nice run, but it is one of the few stocks with actual growth, solid earnings, and a decent dividend. Good luck.Hey, I also bought some NWBI, a bank stock. They also had good earnings and pay a great dividend. It is one of the few banks that has not shot to the moon, so I believe it is fairly priced. I am not pumping NWBI, just sharing an idea if you are looking for a bank stock with a dividend coming in a few days. Do your on DD, and good luck."

"Found this in the IR section, which tells me as Management retires more shares, Samsung will have to give up more shares to stay under the 9% threshold. Just another catalyst on the road to $100. Samsung Display will retain the remaining 80M common shares for three years, and a minimum of 58M common shares until 2028• Corning will have the right to repurchase 22M common shares from SDC in 2024 through 2027"
The news today on Everon puts a new fork in the road for Corning.The #1 issue with 5G is the wireless signal behaves a bit like the old AM radio waves.Interior walls and such block the signal.I have no doubt there will be many players like Cisco who will or do have a similar solution but I'm not as excited about the product itself as I am about Corning entering into a new market because the valuation Wall St. bestows upon those types of companies far exceeds how they value a pure industrial play.For the time being revenues from Everon will be swallowed up in general accounting but if you have the long game in mind and they continue down this road there will be a time when the company will see the wisdom in spinning it off to unlock the value.Another old line industrial giant Siemens has completely reinvented itself and found they could still build locomotives and also sell/license various software components.In a few short years they are doing $4 billion a year and it's growing like a weed.They may well be writing the playbook others will follow.
"Hold on to your hats for this incredibly insightful gem from Zacks:""The [GLW] earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.""Wowzers!!! Isn't that just a real non-statement, if there ever was one???? Gees - us."
"CORNING, NY, Oct. 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corning Incorporated’s (NYSE: GLW) Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share on the company’s common stock. The dividend will be payable on Dec. 18, 2020, to shareholders of record on Nov. 13, 2020."
Stopped in on break picked up 75 shares under 40 thank u Mr. Hedge Fund adding in 10 share increments
They start covering 41.99-42.47 Tomorrow it pops more thru 42.89
"Lots of things to be hyped up about in GLW, especially-Anti-microbial paint taking off around the world, especially in public settings and hospitals. -Billions of glass vials selling to vaccine manufacturers. -5G tech.-Glass for iPhone and other smartphone displays. GLW will complete the circle if it begins providing glass to EV makers and solar panel makers, and makes materials to be incorporated in EV batteries. If GLW does those three more things, it will be the best!Like I said, I like GLW the best, only after TSLA."
"Buckle up! Exciting week ahead Run-up to earnings, earnings and post earnings price action."
"GLW looks like it will bounce back today. Yesterday's drop seemed overdone. GLW will sell all the specialized vials it can make and phone and TV sales will do fine. With 5G, many older phones will not work. My 3G phone had to be replaced before the end of the year. I believe GLW project strong earnings, and the virus explosion will only escalate GLE medical glassware sales. I also like the virus resistant copper infused paint they have come up with. I expect all public buildings, schools, hospitals, et. will jump on this. I don't expect GLW to go into the paint business, but it should be able to license it technology to all the large commercial paint producers. Good luck!"
new glass product product for AR announced
I just did a search on hhs.gov for Fact Sheet : Explaining Operation Warp Speed I had no idea Corning has a contract to supply vials. I am buying Corning now !
"Earnings prediction, blowout .52 vs expected .48. That pushes us over 40. Nice.. ."
As usual outperforming the market.I've owned and traded this stock for quite a few years and cannot remember the last time it has shown so much underlying strength. It is already the highest since March 2001 and with all the growth drivers and excellent operational performance it will be interesting to see where GLW takes us in 2021.
"From Fatta:I can't believe this came from ZACKS. They have never been favorable!This has helped GLW to earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further underscoring the company’s solid position. So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Corning. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment."
Just bought my first few shares of Corning because of their position in 5G as fibre optic manufacturer. I’m here for long.
"I believe GLW said a while back that they were expecting better earnings than originally projected. Hopefully they were being conservative. It is all about expectations. I hope it goes up after earnings, but if it doesn't and the future continues to look bright, I will buy more. Realistically priced stocks with actual earnings are hard to find."
"take profits or not take profits before earnings?with 7000 shares and now a nice gain, what to do? They should hit their gap numbers and the FX currency hedge will add to that. New plants coming on line, they probably bought back another 20M shares, I am going to take my chances and hold these shares."
@steve: Correction to your statement - 30- 37 was the old trading range; now it will be 40-50.
"JPM issued on downgrade on limited earnings growth but maintained their $39 price target. Interesting that GLW just said it projected 5 to 8% earnings growth just two weeks ago. That sounded pretty good to me. I like companies with earnings growth during these difficult times. When the economy picks up again, I expect GLW will continue to grow earnings. Good luck."
"I saw the earnings numbers and listened to call. It was busy day so I wasn't able to watch market. I'll keep it brief, IMO, the market didn't like the operating margins %. The margin % was down from Q4 and part of that was freight/logistics. Given the times inflation, interest rates etc., market is looking at a company's ability to pass on incremental costs and/or willingness, timeliness to pass those costs on.Just my thoughts.~Bubba"
"FWIW. I was on the recent call. It was < a minute in and I had to put WW on mute. It felt like fingernails on the chalkboard. He just can't find the ""zone"" ... speak slowly to avoid having to repeat but not too slow inferring others are stupid and projecting a condescending attitude.~Bubba"
"Can someone help show the math for the book value on Yahoo finance for $17.42,Thanks!"
"have the potential for a gnarly inverted head and shoulders reversal...will be interesting to see where stocks go now after the treasury auction...really need materials to get in gear...on the worst days for glw, materials often show some responsibility...glw never got up off the mat with materials during their morning recovery but glw did form the head/second shoulderto get an idea of the day: look at CAT for the direction and then look at LYB to see how volatile lol"
"After reviewing the earnings in more detail, I agree with a lot of investors on the board, this is the probably the best report one can expect under the current environment with more to come.Even though the guidance was not very clear especially in Optical, the operating margin in the segments with reduced sales is about the same as third quarter 2019. This tells me that when the sales increase the operating leverage is going to drive profitability through the roof. The real heroes in my opinion are Eric Musser who is definitely delivering as the COO and Jeff Evenson who probably drove the structural change to enable Corning to react faster to changing market conditions."
"Help me out, Corning believers: GLW has a place in my portfolio. I heard about them during the Pfizer vaccine rollout, as they were going to produce the vials necessary for storage. In researching them, I discovered that they produce many products that are critical for various industries.While their balance sheet isn't perfect, they do seem to have more than enough funds to continue stable operation. In addition, I get that their stock price isn't exciting.Regardless of their shortcomings, something leads me to have faith in them long-term (and I figured some divvies don't hurt while I wait). Is it safe to say that their products are going to become more important than ever going forward?"

"Published in Fierce Telecom on 8/4/21Tried to add link but was rejected.Joe Jensen, Corning’s Director of FTTH Market Development for the Americas, told Fierce the current state of the broadband market is unlike anything he’s seen over the past two decades, with operator enthusiasm high and money pouring in from all sides. But he noted telecoms still face a number of challenges, among these figuring out how to get a cut of all the new funding and finding the labor force to get their projects done.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jensen pointed to the pandemic as a catalyst for much of the current activity, noting it validated the idea that broadband is critical infrastructure and helped spur higher fiber take rates among consumers.“What we had seen up to this point in time was that carriers were really scrutinizing their business cases for deploying,” he said. “What we’re seeing now, though, is that this is kind of pushing things past a tipping point. Folks in rural markets are starting to look at building, folks in underserved municipal markets are looking at building and there’s a tremendous amount of capital flowing into the space – whether through government funding or private equity firms – that’s really fueling that growth.”A report issued by market research and consulting company RVA LLC in July forecast 61 million homes will be passed with fiber in the five-year period from 2021 to 2025, a figure it flagged as more “than in all of FTTH history combined”. Approximately 40.7 million of these were part of its base forecast, with an additional 4.3 million attributed to builds fueled by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction and 16 million expected to spring from a U.S. infrastructure deal currently being considered by Congress.HurdlesBut even this environment comes with challenges. For instance, though there’s a glut of money available to fuel broadband builds, Jensen said navigating all the different programs is hard. The main issue is “understanding the right fund to use and how to apply,” he said.He also pointed to competition over limited labor resources as an ongoing problem and flagged access to reliable coverage data as another hurdle. The latter is “frustrating our customers as they go to apply for funding,” he said.For operators looking to connect rural and remote areas with fiber, gaining access to middle mile transport is also proving to be difficult. “Really it comes down to middle mile fiber’s not everywhere,” he said. “One of the things we’ve heard is if it does exist, ok that’s one thing that’s great. But it may be owned by an incumbent, for example, and the incumbent may not necessarily be willing to share that middle mile fiber, at least not at an economical rate.”Despite the difficulties, Jensen said there’s “just a lot of positive momentum in the space.” And Corning is already reaping the benefits. The company’s Optical Communications business posted its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in Q2 2021, with revenue rising 21% to $1.08 billion and net income up 83% to $148 million.Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on the company's earnings call last week it has seen a strong uptick in orders in the optical segment, citing ""year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks."" He concluded ""we believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber to the home and hyperscale data centers."""
Consider under $40 a gift. Shouldn't be a penny under$45.
"Time to either sell the entire company or start raising prices. If they are the only game in town, they need to seriously raise prices. If they are not the only game in town, sell the company for $40/sh and be done with it. When factoring in the reduced share count the market cap rise has lagged the market by a serious amount."
