"I'm at a loss as to why GLW hasn't experienced much love this year. It grew earnings by 700% over past year, forecasted to grow earnings at another 33%. Is well under intrinsic fair value by 38%. Has a forward PE of only 16 in an industry with an average of 23. Has a PEG well under 1 at 0.77. With the love expected to hit building up infrastructure, coupled with tech, GLW looks pretty darn good."
"@Bizarittino: well stated! I have owned GLW for 21 years and definitely it is a conservative stock and not like APPL, AMZN, or FB. The dividends have been increasing and I own enough shares from $1-5 to be happy. It would have been nice if I invested in one of those stocks back then, but I am very comfortable nevertheless."
I owned CSCO in the early 2000's when they had a conservative CEO. CSCO would have great earnings the CEO would constantly give conservative forward projections it lingered around $17 for years until they got a new CEO it's now going through 60. Look at MSFT with the previous CEO it increased very little in value it gets a new CEO and it sky rockets. Weeks continually gives ultra conservative forward guidance and that keeps the institutional buying away. I use an algo based system and Corning is rated C for institutional buying if only he would change his ways of giving conservative projections this stock probably would be much higher. It's like he has no confidence in GLW. It is what it is we can't change him or replace him it's just so sad to watch it's such a great company. Let's just hope he retires soon and they bring in some young blood like CSCO and MSFT did so we can make some money. GLTA.
GLW was just recommended by MF RB portfolio.
One product that may shine in the future is Corning's exhaust systems. The corona quarantine offered an unprecedented look at the World with a huge reduction of cars. The C02 dropped dramatically but particulates did not due to truck exhaust. This amplified the need to improve in this area if we truly want to clean up the air.https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/environmental-technologies/life-is-breathtaking.html
"Well, 5G didn't roll out as quickly as once believed it would. Local, fed and state regulations contributed to that. Now that whatever nightmarish paperwork and palm greasing that required is at least known territory, things are humming along and the demand for fiber for the ""last mile"" should continue to increase. I think $42 for GLW in the next 6 months is very realistic."
Why doesn’t Corning get involved in the area of using coated glass to generate electricity and be used for window and facade on buildings and windows on cars and trucks?
"I do realize that GLW has underperformed the market in the last 4 months, but on the flip side I don’t see a single post on why GLW is a good value at ~$37 to attract new money. The usual trashing posts from investors who either bought at the recent 52 week high or in the single digits 20 years ago, who get their daily gratification from watching the stock price. What is not to like from a stock that is selling at a discount to the S&P, increasing dividend, strong growth ahead and the company buying back it’s own stock. Either use this opportunity to buy and recommend to friends and family to average in their positions or short the stock."
"@jeff: having held my big lots for 21 years, I would also would like to discover the reason for the gyrations. Regarding today, the stock was flat since it already was beaten up the past week so further drop would have been unreasonable."
This stock gets no respect from Wall Street. Just don’t understand why down or little movement past two trading days with market up???
Wow. Samsung Corning news re: shares owned. GLW is buying the 35m shares (4% of outstanding shares) to take Samsung down to 9% level and Samsung agreed to hold common shares for another 7 years. Transaction to take place by end of April 2021.The price is going to move today with this news and the job report over the weekend.~Bubba
"Can anyone offer an explanation, given market highs? Thanks."
"Corning Incorporated - Bernstein’s 37th Annual Strategic Decisions ConferenceWednesday, June 2, 2021 10:00 AMWW: ""Recently, we worked with Thermo Fisher and Optima Pharma to identify solutions that increase vial filling capacity up to 70%. This is critical because that is a bottleneck in the production of the COVID vaccine. Our collaboration features a combination of Corning's valor vials and Optima's ultra high-speed fill and finish solutions. Thermo Fisher called the results, a game changer.""~Bubba"
As usual outperforming the market.I've owned and traded this stock for quite a few years and cannot remember the last time it has shown so much underlying strength. It is already the highest since March 2001 and with all the growth drivers and excellent operational performance it will be interesting to see where GLW takes us in 2021.
"I bought a sizeable position on today's dip. GLW is going to profit from all its segments, and it appears they will sell all the vials they can make. I don't know how much they make per vial, but they will be selling them for the foreseeable future. Covid vaccines will need multiple and then yearly shots, so GLW is definitely going to be selling all they can make. The 5G rollout is also good for profits as people are needing to upgrade phones and networks. I believe GLW said they are expecting at least an 8% growth in earnings, so I am expecting they are seeing even better things to come."
"After reviewing the earnings in more detail, I agree with a lot of investors on the board, this is the probably the best report one can expect under the current environment with more to come.Even though the guidance was not very clear especially in Optical, the operating margin in the segments with reduced sales is about the same as third quarter 2019. This tells me that when the sales increase the operating leverage is going to drive profitability through the roof. The real heroes in my opinion are Eric Musser who is definitely delivering as the COO and Jeff Evenson who probably drove the structural change to enable Corning to react faster to changing market conditions."
"This is a farce, management needs to be changed, they have been around to long and possess not creativity in growing and managing this company. Many have said all markets are at a high and this dog continues down. We need to get back the 18 to 19% we've lost. We are in the tech, pharmaceutical, 5G screens of all sort of devices and mind the top player. We beat the last 2 qtrs and are getting pounded, there is no reason for this other than incompetence. We need a total purification, Amen."
The current one year trend line has Corning above $50 before this time next year. Just sitting patiently. Thank you.
Who makes money when they bid it down after hours. It seems to be a regular pattern. Somebody has found a way to profit this way.
I bought a couple of hundred shares more under $37. The company beat earnings and is predicting above estimate earnings for next quarter. It is raising its dividend 9% for this quarter. Barron;s had a analyst this week who raised price target to $44 on strong prospects. I can't think of a better bargain than GLW at these levels. I have no idea why anyone would want to dump shares at this price and just before getting the dividend. Just my thought. Good luck!
Comments why we are going down when market is up? B
I love everyone's exuberance but fridays volume speaks volumes to the legitimacy of this move and the next big move up. Good luck to all who have been around since the early 2000's.
"Earnings prediction, blowout .52 vs expected .48. That pushes us over 40. Nice.. ."
"Found this in the IR section, which tells me as Management retires more shares, Samsung will have to give up more shares to stay under the 9% threshold. Just another catalyst on the road to $100. Samsung Display will retain the remaining 80M common shares for three years, and a minimum of 58M common shares until 2028• Corning will have the right to repurchase 22M common shares from SDC in 2024 through 2027"
"We were all hoping for $1.00, makes sense to be prudent as the pandemic is still in the drivers seat. Hope to see $1.08 for 2022!"
from Fatta:something is going on when GLW is up in a down market day. The volume is not high and it was in positive territory all day. let's keep an eye open.
"It is difficult to post a Barron's article for some reason. The main point I got from the article other than what we know about GLW's business segments and opportunities was the fact that it chief competitor, Nippon Electric Glass had a fire or some kind of incident at a major production facility that affected their production ability. I went to the Nippon site, and there is a letter to shareholders explaining the problem and the uncertainty of when they will be able to resume production. They seem to imply that there is a possibility that it could impact earnings for 20 and possibly 21. I tried to post the letter but it was removed. Check it out for yourself. I believe that was the reason for the upgrade and the Barron's article."
@steve: Correction to your statement - 30- 37 was the old trading range; now it will be 40-50.
"Following this stock for so long, one thing I noticed is GLW would frequently (not always) trade at about the 2x the Nasdaq. If the Naz was up 2%, good chance GLW moved up 4%. Todays GLW (major player in 5g and heavy Covid revenue outlook) is trading around 2x the Dow. Corning seems to have removed its volotility connection to the tech sector and is now looked at by Wall St as a diversified industrial power house. With a pending selloff in the tech sector, nice to know Corning won't trade with it at 2x!"
Similar price action with others reporting today. That includes exceptional volume. Many 52 week lows are former highs of those particular days last year. This is probably mostly profit taking by big investors taking a little off the table to save on taxes and maybe buy a new car. Not worried. This is healthy long term.
"It's all good boys and girls. The market can do what it wants for now. GLW's business is excellent. The price has moved up enough for the time being, it'll trend upwards as time goes on."

"For what it’s worth, CFRA maintains “buy” rating on GLW; places PT of $50 on stock. Nice of them."
@Corning2retire:Triple digits?? Are you kidding? I have not sold any shares/dividends since 2001 but will be happy with 50 for now.
"GLW certainly has momentum. Earnings should be growing, but I wonder if something else positive might be in play. GLW is extremely diversified, and it might be drawing attention from bigger suitors or private equity. But who cares as long as the stock stays strong. Good luck!"
"Been quiet off lately, last day today to buy shares for the $0.24 dividend on Sep. 29, we go ex-dividend on Monday. Other than that no news to pump up the stock price, just collect the dividend and sleep well!"
"At the last earnings report, GLW said how good they were doing on all product lines. They said the forecast would continue to be positive, and they mentioned how they had upped there glass content to around $100 per car. With the economy heating up and people continuing to upgrade phones, TV's, laptops, etc. I can't see any reason for GLW's fundamentals to slide. In fact, GLW said they were in the sweet spot of their R&D as they were not having to spend a great deal on developing new products. I already have a few thousand shares, but if I didn't, I would be buying this dip. As far as the nuclear reactor issue in China, I doubt that is a big deal. China may be secretive, buy the rest of the world has the ability to detect radiation leaks from great distances. We can also see what is going on at the ground level there, so I am sure things must look normal from above. Hey, I may be wrong, but unless something else is hurting GLW, I don't think the known variables are anything but positive. Good luck!"
"BNK Invest released today’s “S&P 500 Movers: GLW, OXY”OXY “topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 3.3%On the other hand, GLW has the following distinction: “the worst performing S&P 500 component thus far on the day is Corning, trading down 3.1%”"
@jeff: Agree with you statement regarding S. At least we get good dividends - for me about 164k/year. Just need patience / this is not a day trading stock!
Nice volume! Over 6 million on the day and over 1.5 million in the last hour.
Corning Up Premarket 4%.Credit Swiss Tech Conference today with update.Fourth Qtr Sales to grow 5 to 8% sequentiallyOperating Margin expected to grow at approx DOUBLE the rate of sales sequentially..Waiting for this run for a LOT of Years.Just Beautiful.!!!!!GLTA...
"Interesting. Twice I've posted my opinion that Corning stock may have gone down due to the administration's and the big 3's as well as other automakers goal of 50% EV production by 2030 because it would affect Corning's Catalyst sales. And twice, the comment has disappeared. Is it being censored? just an opinion, and hardly out of bounds compared to other looney stuff posted not even related to GLW stuff being posted."
"well,well,well here we go again"
"I wouldn’t be surprised if Specialty Materials crosses 2B in annual sales in 2021. Looks like ceramic shield, gorilla glass and advanced optics are all experiencing explosive growth. If you’ll remember the investor presentation from 2019, goal was to reach 2B in sales by 2023."
$15mm award from DoD and HHS to tool up for production of swabs used in Covid 19 testing by robotics.That's the gov't reaching out and saying we can't get enough of these and in the past you guys have come through for us.Here's some cash to push our needs to priority in your production chain.No guidance about how big a market swabs are and what kind of margin to expect.Could just be a drop in the bucket but never hurts to be on the DoD's speed dial.Tried to post the link but it kept failing.
"Is the hoarding of cash what’s keeping GLW from moving higher?After reading the earnings report and an optimistic Qtr 4 and 2021, what is it? It almost seems like the business perfect!"
Optical guidance moved from up 10% to High Teens. Optical is the crown Jewel of GLW. The market will love these earnings. Corning IS delivering on all the things that said they would !!
Nice performance today!
"By my calculation, almost exactly 66% of currency hedge contract loss in Q1 has been recovered in Q2. This will be a significant boost to Q2 GAAP earnings. To the casual retail investor, this will appear to be a great quarter, just like Q1 was falsely perceived to be a very bad quarter. In the short term the stock market is a beauty contest, in the long run it is a scale. GLW is well position for significant growth and profit expansion."
"nice organic price action. This is actual buying, not the company buying back stock."
"An I wrong? Vaccine bottle sales have added little to earnings, and we haven't seen a huge boost to GLW's earnings from coronavirus vaccines. Am I wrong? "
"This happens often and that's why were 15% off our all time high, it makes no sense to drop on a day like this."
.53. or higher tomorrow
2021 EPS estimate: $2.50PPS with a PE of only 20: $50Let us give thanks!
"Seems like investors/traders/society wants instant gratification.....Following any hype. The more hype the better.Too bad GLW doesn't fit in this category, but I own it anyway as a stable holding/div."
"I've been thinking about the many reasons that Corning could be exhibiting weakness and the only thing quite frankly jumps out is inflation. With so many plants, manufacturing, raw materials, supply chain logistics etc, GLW is a little more vulnerable to inflation than some other companies say like Microsoft or Google. The good thing is that the factories are running at capacity and that helps with the fixed costs being spread out over a higher volume of products. Comment/thoughts are welcome..."

"from FattaCFRA Equity and Fund Research Services-- 2/19/2019We expect revenue growth of 6.9% in 2019 and6.0% growth in 2020, following 12% growth in2018, including contributions from the 3Macquisition. The capacity constraints whichlimited growth in 2018 has been solved, with anumber of new plants coming online andadditional investments in capacity planned in2019. We think the Display segment will benefitfrom increasing end-demand in 2019 asaverage screen sizes continue to increase.Gorilla Glass results are likely to improvethroughout 2019 as overall adoption of newproducts like Gorilla Glass 6 and Gorilla GlassSR+ increases. We remain optimistic aboutOptical Communications with fiber demandoutpacing supply in 2018 and theannouncement by Verizon that it wouldpurchase a minimum of $1.05B of opticalsolutions over the next three years.We see gross margins between 41.5% and41.8% in 2019 and 2020, compared to 41% in2018. We expect EBITDA margins will bebetween 29.3% and 29.9% in 2019 and 2020,up from 27.7% in 2018, aided by capacityexpansion.We project EPS of $2.12 in 2019 and $2.30 in2020. We expect GLW's aggressive sharerepurchase program to contribute to growt"
"On first blush, Corning's earnings look stellar."
China has many a bull in their shops. I hope GLW is not as fragile and/or gets kicked around by it. Neutral by me until the ER brings a little more light to it.
Reasonable growth from a semi-industrial company with a dividend. Pick your entry point carefully but GLW remains a buy.
"huge business coming to GLW from APPLE,$40 a share this fall then $50's next year"
Bought back in. Pretty much the same price I sold a couple of years ago. Market has gone almost straight up and this has gone no where. You would think there will be a reversion to the mean at some point.
This could be a great company with more aggressive management entire new line up the good old boys have seen their better days. Fresh blood is what this needs…. Been out since 46 other than a quick in and out made a ton of money here but sadly management is way too layed back aka asleep good luck to all longs…
Hope to see another moderate increase in display glass prices for 4th quarter in 2-3 weeks.
"I'm beginning to think Display may have issue. 8/3/21 OLED was $230 ish, VIAO was $11 ish. OLED is down today 10% to $210. VIAO tumbled the other day to $7 almost 40% down. Bounced back to $8.50 still down 23%. VIAO is GLW partner in their cold fusion GG auto display mfg. process. GLW overall with diversity in different segments would be less impacted.~Bubba"
"@S: Agree completely! Although all of my shares are between $1.60 and $5.0 with dividends reinvested, I will sell most of my holdings as it nears $46."
"from fattaStock futures gain as Pfizer gives upbeat update on coronavirus vaccineNow, remember this:Merck and Pfizer Collaborate with Corning to Modernize Pharmaceutical Glass PackagingAs a result of Merck and Pfizer’s commitment to improving glass quality and promising results from their initial testing, Corning is making an initial investment of $500 million and creating 1,000 new U.S. jobs as the first part of a planned investment of $4 billion and 4,000 new high-tech jobs."
"Hopefully GLW is using this dip to buy back shares. All its divisions are performing well, so I believe the company is in the best position it has been in many years."
I posted 2-3 months ago that I adjusted my avg. daily volume level to 4m. I'm adjusting it again to 3.6m (low 3.2m; high 4m). I don't think any more adjustments will be needed as the Samsung shares have settled in or finishing settling in for the stretch run. Long GLW.~Bubba
"Just added another 1k shares. I read the earnings release and every segment was firing on all cylinders. There was a $50 hit for logistic costs that the company plans on remediating. The company is in some key sectors and growth is predicted to continue and accelerate. GLW will probably buy back more shares and possibly increase the dividend. Comparisons for last year in the coming quarters should be a slam dunk. Hey, GLW has had a nice run, but it is one of the few stocks with actual growth, solid earnings, and a decent dividend. Good luck.Hey, I also bought some NWBI, a bank stock. They also had good earnings and pay a great dividend. It is one of the few banks that has not shot to the moon, so I believe it is fairly priced. I am not pumping NWBI, just sharing an idea if you are looking for a bank stock with a dividend coming in a few days. Do your on DD, and good luck."
"Added 500 shares with a rollover at 36.98 yesterday. January 27, pps will be over 40. Outlook for Q1 will be .60 eps. On track for eps of $2.50 for 2021. Forward PE of 20 brings us to $50 in 2021. Nice.Isn't that special?"
GLW is a #$%$ stock!!
Collecting cheep shares for the dividend on the 26th raised 9% to .24 a share we should start moving up next week.
"Not sure if anyone noticed, but the vol. in the last hour on Friday was over a million shares."
The news today on Everon puts a new fork in the road for Corning.The #1 issue with 5G is the wireless signal behaves a bit like the old AM radio waves.Interior walls and such block the signal.I have no doubt there will be many players like Cisco who will or do have a similar solution but I'm not as excited about the product itself as I am about Corning entering into a new market because the valuation Wall St. bestows upon those types of companies far exceeds how they value a pure industrial play.For the time being revenues from Everon will be swallowed up in general accounting but if you have the long game in mind and they continue down this road there will be a time when the company will see the wisdom in spinning it off to unlock the value.Another old line industrial giant Siemens has completely reinvented itself and found they could still build locomotives and also sell/license various software components.In a few short years they are doing $4 billion a year and it's growing like a weed.They may well be writing the playbook others will follow.
"from fattamalle:WOW! Finally:Corning initiated with a Buy at UBS UBS analyst John Roberts initiated coverage of Corning with a Buy rating and $43 price target. The analyst cites the company's leading position in the roughly 10% of glass/ceramic applications as specialty materials. Roberts adds that Corning is continually reinventing itself as new applications replace older ones, with 8% R&D as a percentage of sales being the highest in his coverage. The analyst further states that there is ""no end in sight"" for growth in optical fiber used in 5G and data centers as well as LCD/OLED display glass."
"GLW got hammered today for no reason. All the fundamentals are in place, and they should remain so for the foreseeable future. Earnings are growing in just about all of their diversified product lines. Today's dip below $40 looks like a good entry point or a level to add shares. Unlike many other stocks, GLW has actual sales and earnings and a bright future. Good luck!"
"I'm just a little surprised at the current weakness in the SP and not sure what to make out of it, maybe manipulation is the only thing that comes to mind unless the inflationary costs hit GLW like a tornado in Q3.Recent News Updates:1) EPA registration of guardiant antimicrobial particles in paint - Think of all the hospitals, schools, airports train stations etc. that will use this paint.2) 4th quarter dividend announcement of $0.24, hoping for $0.27 first quarter 2022.3) $150 Million expansion of optical based on commitment from AT&T, similar to Verizon deal in 2017 and this is over and above the capacity already in place for the Verizon deal.The weakness amid all this news all but suggests that there is some manipulation to shake off the weak hands. Of course some of the weakness is coming from the market, but we had lost a lot of ground when the market was strong. 2021 YTD TR performance of GLW -> 4.35% vs S&P 500 -> 17%Not sure what it is but the company has no respect on the street and only time will tell who is right.We need solid Q3 results and Q4 guidance to shake us out of this malaise.Comments?"
So if you're long $GLW and believe the story then the market has just given you an opportunity to buy in at a small discount. Expect weakness all day and maybe the rest of the week. I doubt the stock is going to $40 or below (until there is a market correction later in the year) so buy in and enjoy.
"Jeff, good info. I too read where Asiya Merchant raised GLW's price target to $42. It's about time GLW starts getting some respect. They already predicted they will do better than they estimated earlier, so their next earnings should be at or above the revised estimates. Good luck!"
"1.40 Swing today in share price. Do they (MM) play us like a fiddle or what.?Hey Bubba, can you quantify GLW's exposure in China? % of manufacturing, sales, etc. Heavens Forbid, If China blows up & decides to invade Taiwan, that's gotta be a game changer for the US & the World. Especially all the American Companies Manufacturing over there. Can't imagine the Impact.!!Doubt if the Corpse in Charge will do any retaliation. Just not very optimistic on the World View of things.Any clarity would be appreciated...GLTA"
"Typical of GLW board, no one has anything to say when GLW outperforms the market 4X!"
"Analysis Request from Corning Investors: Yesterday (March 29th) there was tremendous volume (8 plus million shares)rapidly going back and forth throughout the day with only a .1 cent loss at the closing while a 52 week high of 44.12 was reached as well. Corning ultimately held on tight to the $2 plus gains from the day before and the gains from the day before that. Today, except for a short, early rise, Corning was down most of the day until the last 1/2 hr. where it ended ""up"" .20 cents on the day at very, very low volume. Leaving the general market out of the equation for a minute, what are your opinions? I think professional moderate, and conservative investors are locking in their positions for growth and income for their investors and individual investors like myself are looking for less risky growth and income in the medium to long term as well. Meaning, I think Corning has earned the trust and respect by ""Investors"" to manage its success. stear through turbulance. innovate daily, and timely deliver quality, state of the art products to it's customers all the while giving back a nice, and yearly rising dividend. Buy hey, though I do my due diligence, I'm an optimist and a moderate risk taker in dividend generating stocks in general."
"COVID support, 5G ramp, growth potential, and dividend...what's not to like? Solid long term investment."
"Well, the results are precisely what they stated they would be months ago. It was already baked in. But, facts never seem to matter to the market when it comes to GLW. The word ""idling' is a good choice of words. A lot of speculation on companies that will/could potentially profit from 5G has grossly inflated the P/E of several, but fiber optics is required for the last mile (unless one plans on standing in line of sight with a pole)...and for all intents and purposes, the rubber hasn't hit the pavement on the road to 5G, yet. The question is, will 5G actually ever be installed to any significant degree? I am guessing - yes, but no one knows at what rate. The current rate is amebic...and GLW is now joined at the hip with that rate of implementation. Meanwhile, the market just loves super devices, connectors and chips that have very few places to go - yet. And, the market appears to think they'll be good for something other than a paperweight. Yep, it isn't just glw that is idling … waiting for a reason to put that engine into gear - they are just the only one punished for 5G's current near non-existent expansion rate."

"Earnings was good but is this what's dragging it down? These particular categories? I am new to GLW so just wondering. [Sales were up 4% year-over-year in display technologies, which mostly supplies television manufacturers. The company said that price declines “were moderate” in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 10% in optical communications, off 5% in environmental technologies, and down 13% in life sciences.Corning didn’t provide fourth-quarter financial guidance.]"
GLW should be $50 by now.
"It’s funny how some of the other msg. boards like TSLA have thousands of messages every day and GLW less than a hundred/week, quietly outperforming the market and at multi year highs. Every time we post a new high, I see msgs. from newbies. GlW is flying high below the radar."
"what lovely person/shop loves hitting that sell button at the market open and close??? Hey buddy, the fundamentalists won't let you blow up the technical picture to create a deeper selloff...look at the open and closing in regards to previous days close and it seems like they are trying soo hard lolhow much more positive news can this stock get to move back towards its recent highs? Surely we can break out of this range!"
@S: how many shares did you purchased? Have to be careful with GLW when making purchases now.
"Do you remember how quick WW was to tamper down analysts' expectations and temper guidance downward just before the last earnings release. He seems to spend more time trying to woo the analysts and make them look good than taking care of his shareholders. I wish he would give a little more thought to discussing all of the future positive things going on at GLW ---- or at least give the negative and positive perspectives equal time. If he can't do it or doesn't want to, maybe he should consider engaging a good PR firm. I hope GLW is not all TVs. That's the past. Aren't we doing things with the automotive world, the building industry, the pharma industry, the communications industry, and maybe a few other areas as well. Share prices move up on long term perspectives. WW just concentrates on the ST ones that only appeal to in and out traders and not LT holders. Am I the only one that feels this way? I have been a ""too -long-holder"" for the return I got over 10 years. My patience is waning."
"take profits or not take profits before earnings?with 7000 shares and now a nice gain, what to do? They should hit their gap numbers and the FX currency hedge will add to that. New plants coming on line, they probably bought back another 20M shares, I am going to take my chances and hold these shares."
"This is actually the first time in a long time that I’m not worried about the dip, for a couple of reasons.1) The yield at 55% over the S&P 500 becomes more attractive as the price dips and buyers will appear as it gets more attractive and not to forget 10% div. increases in 2022 and 2023. 2) Tony is waiting on the sidelines hopefully scooping up shares. If Samsung deal was done now the share count would have been further reduced by 4M shares.3) They’ve learnt their lesson from the last optical build out that there will be no capital investment for any one customer unless cash is received upfront. Eg. Apple, Uncle Sam4) No build capital required to meet sales target thru 2023, meaning a lot of free cash flows to further buyback shares and increase dividend. 5) No real pricing pressure as demand exceeds supply in all businesses, only negative is exposure to increased operating costs due to inflation.6) All growth drivers firmly in place, part of the selling is obviously market driven but others selling are probably cashing out to pay for other bets gone wrong. In fact I’ve been telling my friends to average in their Corning position if they have cash on the sidelines."
"Nice to see GLW performing well, and would be thrilled if it continues after tomorrow's earnings; however, I'm sure everyone is concerned it may fall, as it has done many times in the past.Hoping for the best ..."
As we approach earnings would like to get opinions on price action post earnings. I’m hoping that we will trade over $22 after earnings.
"Down 20% off the annual high. I want to get back into GLW but, I wonder what is going to happen when the market enters a correction (which I believe will be within 6 months). I suppose I could dollar-cost average in however; I believe there is more short term down-side to up. Thoughts?"
"from Fatta:New buy recommendation from BofA Merrill LynchKey reasons to BuyWe upgrade Corning from Neutral to Buy rating as (1) we view the growth profile asbetter than historical and more diversified, (2) Gross profit dollar growth should scalewith near term investments that are impacting gross margin rates, (3) glass pricingenvironment is a tailwind and could surprise incrementally to upside, (4) operatingleverage should help drive incremental margin expansion over the next few years, (5)opportunity to return incremental capital to shareholders through corporateactions/incremental debt, (6) Lower capital intensity for new initiatives given ability tore-use idle capacity (e.g. Gorilla Glass), (7) We expect a positive update at the upcominginvestor day in mid-June, and (8) Corning is significantly outgrowing declining unitgrowth in smartphones, TVs, Autos given its increasing content in each of these. Ournew PO of $40 (was $38) is based on 18x C20E EPS of $2.18. We view the pullback inshares yesterday (-6% vs SPX up 0.1%) as an especially attractive buying opportunity."
"@Robert: I think anyone would bless what you have done and congrats...you have more than earned your right to hit the sell button@S: Unfortunate that you bought it at $46 as a trade...no one cares if you sellIMO, as you all have seen: I think the future is very bright for the end markets it serves. Think another overlooked part of there business is ownership interest in Hemlock Semiconductors that makes some of the highest quality and cleanest silicon and related chemicalsCorning was literally built for this era!"
Volume was super high today but this stock is in fact a #$%$ I've had this for 20 years and am incredibly dissatisfied.
"I love the volume. it speaks volumes. we should have a good upside until the Q1 reports come. If they continue to reflect growth, up we go. Stay strong all longs."
"From Real Money article: I like it ALOT!Meanwhile, Corning has continued to do what attracted me to shares in the first place -- returning capital to the shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. The company bought back $347 million in stock for the quarter and $2.23 billion in all of 2018. The buybacks decreased Corning's shares outstanding to 788 million, down 9% from last year and down nearly 50% from 2011.Since late 2015, Corning has returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through the combination of buybacks and dividends. It also has increased the dividend 50% during that time frame. Last year, the quarterly payouts were increased 16% from 15.5 cents a share to 18 cents; the prior year's dividend increase was nearly 15%. The question now is whether the company will increase the dividend this year, and if so, by how much?We should know as early as next week whether Corning sticks to the pattern of the last four years of increasing the dividend in February after keeping it steady for four quarters. Judging by the increases of the last couple years, one could expect the new dividend rate to be in the range of 21.5 cents to 22 cents. That would put the indicated dividend yield in the 2.6% range, up from the current 2.1%. Of course, whether there will be a dividend increase at all is conjecture at this point, but we'll know soon."
Just bought my first few shares of Corning because of their position in 5G as fibre optic manufacturer. I’m here for long.
I thought 5th time was going to be the charm but looks like we will have another down day. Amazing how there are no buyers for a dividend growth stock selling at a discount to the market.
"Interesting start to the week GLW stock wise and Market movements. GLW has 11 trading days left before going ex-dividend on 5/27. The heavy volume (GLW and S&P) at open this am didn't look encouraging with GLW being down 2.59% vs SPY down 1.78%. GLW was knocking on $44/share and it looked as though we'd test the $43.50/share that GLW did buyback on 4/5. About 10:45am things turned and GLW caught support to finish the day -.22% but SPY closed -.89%, considerably lower.IMO, the stock has growth and finally seeing signs of dividend support paired with the growth. It will be an interesting follow the next 20 trading days as we head into and exit the ex-dividend date. Especially if Markets have downside pressure like this am.~Bubba"
"SOMEDAY, after holding this stock for over 24yrs, someone will be able to explain the gyrations of this equity.What keeps this propped up on a day like today? Any news out there?"
yeah might be pennies in front of a steamroller...but holly guacamole just out of the money weeklys when this thing has basically been preprogrammed for this trading range...be careful but glw is a loaded spring right now 
"Wow! This was announced on March 26, surprised no one posted it....Corning is announcing a moderate increase to its display glass substrate prices in the second quarter of 2021.This price adjustment is a result of increased costs in logistics, energy, raw materials and other operational expenses during the current glass shortage. Additionally, the costs of precious metals required for maintaining reliable glass substrate manufacturing have risen significantly since 2020. While Corning has sought to offset these added costs with productivity enhancements, it can no longer fully absorb them.Corning expects glass supply to remain short-to-tight in the upcoming quarters and will continue to partner with customers to maximize our glass supply to them."
"I sold 40% of my holdings of GLW yesterday on the pop, and I bought it all back today under $38. I really like GLW's prospects, but I thought yesterday's jump was exaggerated due to the coming dividend. I played it safe, and just sold part. I expect GLW will move over $40 in the next month or two, so I wanted to keep my position. Good luck!"
Question for the board. After spending gazillions opening up factory after factory in China is thereAny chance Corning can some way start to divest itself from manufacturing in China.?Bring it back to the states.Will Apple ?Do these companies see thru the same lenses that Apple Pie Americans see thru.?
"Hold on to your hats for this incredibly insightful gem from Zacks:""The [GLW] earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 30, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.""Wowzers!!! Isn't that just a real non-statement, if there ever was one???? Gees - us."
Corning has earned 40 to be its base. Solid company. Needed long term products and a rising dividend.
"I saw the earnings numbers and listened to call. It was busy day so I wasn't able to watch market. I'll keep it brief, IMO, the market didn't like the operating margins %. The margin % was down from Q4 and part of that was freight/logistics. Given the times inflation, interest rates etc., market is looking at a company's ability to pass on incremental costs and/or willingness, timeliness to pass those costs on.Just my thoughts.~Bubba"
"Well, it dropped more today, so I tripled my 500 shares. I think the company is just too good to give back just about all of the momentum it gained from the great Barron's article. I am not seeing a large amount of volume, so I think GLW is definitely a good long term play that will let you sleep at night. I hope I am right.Hey, on a bright note, my wife and I got our second PFE vaccine shot today. Because of the snow in the NE, we left early and got there at the open. The line was long, but we were happy to get the shots. A friend of our said they returned home because they heard that the site was closing due to the snow. Bummer. I shoveled my large driveway as much as I could just in case I feel crummy tomorrow.Stay safe!!!"
"From Fatta:I can't believe this came from ZACKS. They have never been favorable!This has helped GLW to earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further underscoring the company’s solid position. So, if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry, consider Corning. Not only is its industry currently in the top third, but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late, suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment."
"I believe GLW said a while back that they were expecting better earnings than originally projected. Hopefully they were being conservative. It is all about expectations. I hope it goes up after earnings, but if it doesn't and the future continues to look bright, I will buy more. Realistically priced stocks with actual earnings are hard to find."
"Corning is the perfect stock: a tech stock plus a coronavirus stock, with no risk of its lunch being eaten by some other company. It will be making the vials for the vaccines, so no matter who gets to the top in the coronavirus vaccine competition, Corning is a winner. It supplies the glass for smartphone screens and, again, Corning comes out a winner no matter which smartphone maker gets to the top. It is providing things for 5G, which is a technology growing exponentially. Right now, I peg Corning only second to TSLA."
I think the analysts' price targets are too conservative on this company. I honestly see GLW going a lot higher from here due to the high demand for their products. I invested several weeks ago for that very reason and already have a 22% return. My price target honestly is in the 60-70 range. We will see how it plays out but one thing I'm certain of is that this name has more room to run from here.
"I almost doubled my position on today's dip. With the virus totally out of control, GLW will sell all the vials it can make. The glass for 5G, phones, TV's etc. should also do well as we once again have to hunker down. To me GLW benefits from the virus issue. Hopefully vaccines will be available as soon as possible."
I am not the robert poster that's been on here forever but a new robert!!I agree with the recent post to change management it would be great for this company. Wendell has been around too long and is too weak!! We need new blood at the top I have never seen such a great quarter like they just had rewarded with a 15% stock price drop something is wrong.
Could GLW also be an infrastructure play with fiber optic cable and connectivity products?
"""maybe they are set to announce their new capital allocation plan which will be for $10B over 3 years and include 10% dividend raises and $5B stock buyback.""They literally announce that today (my guess from 2 days ago) and the stock goes down. I don't get this companyExpects growth investments to drive 6-8% sales and 12-15% EPS compound annual growth rates in 2020-2023Targets shareholder distributions of $8 billion to $10 billion, including annual increases in dividend per share of at least 10%"
glw raised price of display screens and buying back shares that's a positive 
"GLW to $100! What can I say, my specialty is making spectacular things happen. I am like AI, I know exactly the buttons to press in the matrix of existence to get things done. GLW will revisit its DOTCOM bubble highs, soon!"
GLW is reportedly getting $57 million to increase vial production. No wonder GLW is bouncing back again. This company is loaded with options and a host of products that are in great demand.
"There is absolutely no trust or confidence in this Corning management team and the only solution is to purify this group with new management. As shareholders we gave dealt with this ineptitude to long, we deserve sound managers who will grow the company and grow earnings."
"From Fatta:Good news from Barrons.Barron#$%$ And Pans: Chevron, Corning, GlaxoSmithKline And MoreIn ""Corning Shares Could Gain More Than 25%,"" Leslie P. Norton makes a case that Corning Incorporated shares could rally as demand grows for the company's optical fiber, LCD-panel glass and Gorilla Glass. Its shares have marched higher for the past two years, but see why Barron's thinks its prospects look even brighter as the company's new businesses bear fruit."
"Lots of things to be hyped up about in GLW, especially-Anti-microbial paint taking off around the world, especially in public settings and hospitals. -Billions of glass vials selling to vaccine manufacturers. -5G tech.-Glass for iPhone and other smartphone displays. GLW will complete the circle if it begins providing glass to EV makers and solar panel makers, and makes materials to be incorporated in EV batteries. If GLW does those three more things, it will be the best!Like I said, I like GLW the best, only after TSLA."
Back in. Chart looks good for new entry.
"GLW has increased the amount of its products that are included in cars. With the tens of thousands of cars destroyed by the floods, GLW's auto products segment should be hard pressed to meet the demand."
"Corning Inc. GLW is planning to increase production of glass vials for COVID-19 vaccines by 50% from prior targets, after receiving more federal funding, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The glass maker is now expecting to produce 150 million vials this year, that will hold about 1.2 billion vaccine doses, the paper reported, citing Brendan Mosher, vice president and general manager of the company's pharmaceutical technologies business."
"One year ago, $31. Today $41. Next year $55. Steady as she goes......"
"Published in Fierce Telecom on 8/4/21Tried to add link but was rejected.Joe Jensen, Corning’s Director of FTTH Market Development for the Americas, told Fierce the current state of the broadband market is unlike anything he’s seen over the past two decades, with operator enthusiasm high and money pouring in from all sides. But he noted telecoms still face a number of challenges, among these figuring out how to get a cut of all the new funding and finding the labor force to get their projects done.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jensen pointed to the pandemic as a catalyst for much of the current activity, noting it validated the idea that broadband is critical infrastructure and helped spur higher fiber take rates among consumers.“What we had seen up to this point in time was that carriers were really scrutinizing their business cases for deploying,” he said. “What we’re seeing now, though, is that this is kind of pushing things past a tipping point. Folks in rural markets are starting to look at building, folks in underserved municipal markets are looking at building and there’s a tremendous amount of capital flowing into the space – whether through government funding or private equity firms – that’s really fueling that growth.”A report issued by market research and consulting company RVA LLC in July forecast 61 million homes will be passed with fiber in the five-year period from 2021 to 2025, a figure it flagged as more “than in all of FTTH history combined”. Approximately 40.7 million of these were part of its base forecast, with an additional 4.3 million attributed to builds fueled by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction and 16 million expected to spring from a U.S. infrastructure deal currently being considered by Congress.HurdlesBut even this environment comes with challenges. For instance, though there’s a glut of money available to fuel broadband builds, Jensen said navigating all the different programs is hard. The main issue is “understanding the right fund to use and how to apply,” he said.He also pointed to competition over limited labor resources as an ongoing problem and flagged access to reliable coverage data as another hurdle. The latter is “frustrating our customers as they go to apply for funding,” he said.For operators looking to connect rural and remote areas with fiber, gaining access to middle mile transport is also proving to be difficult. “Really it comes down to middle mile fiber’s not everywhere,” he said. “One of the things we’ve heard is if it does exist, ok that’s one thing that’s great. But it may be owned by an incumbent, for example, and the incumbent may not necessarily be willing to share that middle mile fiber, at least not at an economical rate.”Despite the difficulties, Jensen said there’s “just a lot of positive momentum in the space.” And Corning is already reaping the benefits. The company’s Optical Communications business posted its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in Q2 2021, with revenue rising 21% to $1.08 billion and net income up 83% to $148 million.Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on the company's earnings call last week it has seen a strong uptick in orders in the optical segment, citing ""year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks."" He concluded ""we believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber to the home and hyperscale data centers."""
"With the new tax rates, it's time to increase the dividend again. Let's go Corning and reward your shareholders."
"I see more valor glass vials being sold, more gorilla glass for phones,tv's and EV's sold, more 5G cable sold, and more diesel filters sold two to 5yrs down the road plus new products brought to market along the way. In my view, I feel Corning like utility stocks will be a good hedge against inflation if there is inflation, while also providing growth . Companies are now relying on Cornings products for the integrity and quality of their own products. Whats a product with out Gorilla Glass, or Valor Glass, or 5G cable? An inferior product. If Corning is heavily sold into this earnings call it will only be a buying opportunity for others so I still feel we are in a 40 to 50 buying range. Once we get past 50 and hold there (this year or next) I think Corning enters a new league with a solid base to grow from. Investors are paying attention so It will be interesting to see how the economy grows into 2022 and beyond while Corning grows and evolves at its own pace."
Consider under $40 a gift. Shouldn't be a penny under$45.
I am having trouble digesting this. Corning announces they are growing their fiber infrastructure adding 200 jobs and it goes down 1.50 in two days. They say the demand for fiber is very strong maybe they should raise their prices to AT&T and make some money. Something is wrong with the management at Corning they must be weak and easy to take advantage of. Same with the bottles for Covid must be selling them too cheap! Maybe they do not know inflation is everywhere and letting profits slip away. I am sure the workers are getting paid more how about increasing prices of the products! Weak management very weak!!
"from FattaRemember this?CORNING, N.Y. – Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced the execution of a long-term purchase and supply agreement for Corning Valor Glass.Corning’s Valor Glass packaging solution has been designed to enable superior chemical durability and resist breakage, damage, and particulate contamination. In addition, Valor Glass has a low-friction exterior coating that enhances manufacturing productivity by enabling increased throughput and quality assurance for pharmaceutical manufacturers.Pfizer and Corning are encouraged by the FDA’s role to facilitate adoption of emerging technologies, like Valor Glass, with the potential to improve biopharmaceutical product quality on a broad scale.NOW ADD THIS TO THE PICTURE:Pfizer to manufacture Gilead's antiviral drug remdesivir to treat covid 19Gilead hopes to be able to produce more than 2 million treatment courses by the end of the yearBTW: a treatment course is 5 days. That is a lot of vilesIt is starting to look like a pretty picture"
@Hobo: you are just like me. I agree that complaints are warranted but thank god for the increasing dividends.
"At the end of the last quarter, the CFO said they expected a strong quarter to end the year. Sounded good to me then, and it still does now. With their anti-microbial paint, $15 million dollar investment from the gov., vial production, gorilla glass, auto emission glass, TV and phone screens, etc., GLW seems to be in all the sweet spots. We shall see tomorrow. This market does not act like us old time investors would expect, so I am ready for anything. Good luck!"
"From Fatta:A serious question for other investors on this board:The company appears to be doing many right things so this question does not have to do with Corning performance.The question is how many of you are happy, satisfied or feel good about the stock performance? Only the stock performance. If not what do you think is the problem?I was thrilled with the quarterly report and was thrilled with the shareholder presentation but here we are again. It's like a magical yo-yo that goes up once and down 4 times.Maybe I am missing something and wonder what the rest of you think."
Corning Reorganizes under New COO.Check Out Seeking Alpha
The MACD has bottomed out and we have a bullish cross on the ADX not to mention the 100day crossing the 200 on the hourly chart in the middle of July consolidation after earnings after a slight drop has been the norm for most after earnings so I see this continuing the uptrend. IMO this is a strong buy here and expect to fill the gap at 34 sooner than later...
"It seems that no company, no matter how big the ER blowout, can hit the ""whisper number"" that goes with every quarterly report in a bull market like this. I'm seeing it with virtually all my holdings. They will all recover because the companes are sound."
Ex dividend 11/15today is the last day to capture the dividend
"From Fatta:B of A ResearchCorning Inc. (GLW)Our price objective for Corning is $38 and is based on 22x our 2021E EPS of $1.70. Thismultiple compares to historical range of 10x-24x, with median 15x. We feel our choice ofmultiple balances near term gross margins pressure vs. longer term share gains in LCDglass. We also remain positive based on use of Gorilla Glass in new end markets(including automotive), and a strong capital return program.Upside risks to our price objective are better adoption of Gorilla Glass, better thanexpected TV unit and area growth, upside from recovery in the heavy truck business, andupside from stronger telecom demand. Downside risks to our price objective are anunexpected slowdown in TV sales, glass supply/demand becoming unbalanced due tomore than expected supply coming online, Corning's customers cutting utilization ratesmore than expected thereby reducing demand for LCD glass substrates, and higher thanexpected CapEx investments."
"This stock never ran up with Apple when it ran to over $200 a share, but drops like a log when Apple reports bad news. This drop is a joke when you consider Cornings overall business. A drop of .40 or .50 a share would be fair but even that would be high."
could hit 43.00 after earnings
"Buckle up! Exciting week ahead Run-up to earnings, earnings and post earnings price action."
"Time for Corning to spend every bit of the buyback fund NOW! Maximize value for the shareholders, remove maximum number of shares at these Blue Light Special prices!"
With a trailing PE of 38 and a Forward PE of 17 what more do you expect? This has never been a high growth stock and it’s future has always looked bright but their ability to deliver consistently increasing profits has been spotty so my expectation is $44 by year end and I am okay with that being a long term holder.
"The market is up, and GLW is down, as usual; as mentioned previously, same reaming, different day, lol"
"from FattaBofA SecuritiesF3Q rev grows high-teens q/q ex Hemlock transactionCorning recently announced that F3Q sales are expected to grow by low-teens percentq/q driven by strength in its Specialty Materials and Environmental segments. This ishigher than our/Street prior expectation of high-single-digit growth q/q. In addition,Hemlock redeemed DuPont’s 40.25% ownership, which increases Corning’s ownership to80.5%. So instead of having equity earnings from Hemlock, Corning will consolidate itsrevenues and earnings. Corning’s EPS for F3Q is expected to grow more than the Streetestimate of 30% q/q. We expect near-term demand for Gorilla Glass to remain strong asnew smartphones and tablets are released in the fall and also expect Environmental tokeep benefiting as customer automotive plants ramp back up, and given increasedadoption of gas particulate filters (GPF). Free cash flow is expected to be positive forF20. We reiterate our Buy rating on glass supply/demand balance, glass price declinesremaining moderate, increased adoption of Gorilla Glass and upside from increasedadoption of GPF in vehicles with additional optionality from Valor Glass (pharma usecase)."
"Disappointing day for sure, getting caught between customers and suppliers. About time GLW get a bad attitude and start aggressively mitigating the inflationary costs and sticking it to customers with an adjustable levy, just like steel makers do with the price of scrap metal."
"Poor performance again today, and unfortunately, for the most part, this has been the pattern since reaching its 52-week high on April 26th. The decline has been ~ 8% since; will this pattern continue, and if so, how low will it go?"
I enjoy owning this stock. Great products and they are keeping up with technology if not leading in most all areas.
Should be a dividend announcement shortly..
"Definitely forgot about the preferred conversion and JP Morgan timed the downgrade right around the conversion deadline of Jan 15, 2021 or 25 days above 35 within 40 trading days before 7 years. Samsung will be forced to sell ~36M shares to stay under the 9% threshold after conversion. GLW will be under pressure in the short term with the dilution sale. Not sure if Corning can cough up 1.26B and buy the 36M shares in a private transaction. I wonder if that was the reason we never shot past $35 in the past and not sure what to make of it right now. Comments or thoughts from other investors are welcome."
what is going on with glw
Director bought
"CORNING, N.Y., Sept. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced it is expanding its longtime collaboration with AT&T (NYSE: T). The two companies will work together to extend investments in fiber infrastructure, expand U.S. broadband networks, and accelerate 5G deployment. Based on AT&T’s long-term commitment to its network buildout, Corning is investing $150 million in optical cable manufacturing in North Carolina, initially adding 200 jobs."
"Wendell Weeks Share SalesCan someone shed light on CEO share sales after every quarter, like clockwork after every quarter results you see him selling.Is he exercising options that expire every quarter?"
Barron's just.came out with a favorable article on Corning saying glass for screens are in high demand and that the rest of Cornings business' are doing very well. The price was raised to over 50 in the article as well!
"Unlike many stocks, this one has already taken a 13% haircut off of it's 52 week high. I don't want to see this drift under $40. Ridiculous."
GLW is way underpriced. Conservative estimates for the near future are $45. GLW is both a industry and a technology company. It is in the best position that I have seen in the last 30 years. I predict that this security will be at least $62 by the end of the year perhaps even more.
"Can't figure why GLW has languished lately. With the the specialty glass shortage, virus fighting paint formulation, competitor's production problems, and government funding for increased production capacity, I would think the stock would have at least held its own. It also projected higher growth a while back, so they will most likely have decent earnings. Maybe they should have kept the good news to themselves and surprised the market at earnings. Then again, maybe they left a little good new up their sleeves. At least they have decent earnings and interests in many important product lines. Good luck!"
time for glw to head to 40 or above get ready for the move up
"From FattaNew CFRA report:We expect revenue growth of 6.9% in 2019 and6.0% growth in 2020, following 12% growth in2018, including contributions from the 3Macquisition.

"To all new Corning ""Investors"" this past year: I still believe 40 is our new base and that Corning is still fundamentally undervalued but knowing this stock as I do (I have visited Corning and spoke with workers and locals over the past 20 years) now more then ever I believe Corning is a solid Growth & Yield investment that I believe is now in a stable 40 to 50 trading range. Their products, balance sheet, outlook, increasing dividend, and innovative initiatives speak for themselves. But know this, Corning evolves and grows at its own pace based on research and societal needs they can actually improve. They don't waste their time and they are not a one-trick pony anymore. Those days are long gone! They presently have many common sense and proven,""New Economy"" ways to make money with ideas and innovations in the pipeline. But nobody is going to rush this company. That is the purposeful and upstate New York way. Slow and steady means quality control and they are not about to change that business philosophy now. Corning has earned its stripes to be looked at as a Growth & Income stock.All the early investors have always known this but the new investors need.to know the history. So if you are young, re-invest your dividends and add to your position when you can . If you are retired or need the money, take the dividends and hold your investment. But either way, to me, Corning is presently a buy and long term hold that is in a good trading range. Conservatively and long term speaking, IMHO, anything above 50 strengthens Corning for solid dividend increases and moderate growth long term. Still long and strong!"
"If you believe Morninstar, don't expect over $40 anytime soon (read below.) I agree with some of HOBO's thoughts on the price movement of this stock. It will drive you insane.Analyst Note | by William Kerwin Updated Jul 27, 2021Narrow-moat Corning reported second-quarter results at the top ends of its guidance ranges, and we’re bumping up our fair value estimate to $40 per share from $38, as we expect the firm to continue benefiting from robust demand and tight supply for the rest of 2021. Long term, we think Corning’s engineering and manufacturing prowess and centralized cost advantage will allow the firm to maintain leadership positions in its diverse end markets and sustain profitable growth."
I am surprised we have not gotten any upgrades or PT adjustments. Apple came out with earnings last night and already there are numerous upgrades and adjustments.

"from fattaThis says it allCorning isn't an exciting growth stock, but it provides a balanced way to invest in the long-term expansion of the mobile, optical, life science, and auto markets. Corning's end markets are cyclical, but its current growth cycle hasn't peaked yet -- and its dividends should continue rising for the foreseeable future."
glw down again
hopefully we hit 43.00 next week
"@HOBO: I am down about 1.7M with the boatload of GLW that I own. However. I believe we will rise to the low 40’s by years end, but not 50. If it reaches the old high or higher, I am definitely selling my larger blocks. It is a shame this stock is such a poor growth stock over the past 20 years."
Corning is down today 6 times more than the market and now down 20% from the high. It's a constant battle with this turd. We get one run up then we go to the slaughterhouse.
glw a stock you want to own forget about it and collect the dividend . why isn't anyone talking about what will propel glw to 50.00.. ?? I've only just started a position. was lucky to get 1/3 yesterday at 27.07 .anyway this company makes. one of the most important piece of the 5g build out .. 5g can't build out without this what is it ?
"Where are the cry babies today!! Never see anyone posting on a day when GLW outperforms the market.Dividends also announced today!! Operation Warp speed, 5G acceleration, infratructure stimulus, rural broadband, IT spending for bandwidth, all trends looking good!"
"CORNING, NY, Oct. 07, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corning Incorporated’s (NYSE: GLW) Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share on the company’s common stock. The dividend will be payable on Dec. 18, 2020, to shareholders of record on Nov. 13, 2020."
"have the potential for a gnarly inverted head and shoulders reversal...will be interesting to see where stocks go now after the treasury auction...really need materials to get in gear...on the worst days for glw, materials often show some responsibility...glw never got up off the mat with materials during their morning recovery but glw did form the head/second shoulderto get an idea of the day: look at CAT for the direction and then look at LYB to see how volatile lol"
"I wonder why analyst's only project out only 1 to 2 years for Corning, when there are a lot of upcoming technologies and markets where Corning will be a major player because of their size, scale and commitment to research and innovation.Why don't analyst's put any value on quantum communications, carbon capture, glass and ceramics in Li-ion batteries, EUV and the list goes on....Clearly the analysts don't understand the growth potential of this company, wise and patient investors on this board should take advantage of the dislocation in valuation."
"@S: I would not be too concerned if you have a long term horizon. I have bought and traded blocks now and then (5000 - 10000 shares at higher prices than 25-30) and experienced what you are experiencing. Just have to patient - never lost any money even despite being on margin. But sometimes I had to hold for a few months, sometimes only a few days. Good luck."
hoping for 45.00 by middle of August.
To the Moon!!!! I expect news on the vaccine will boost corning in the coming months...
new glass product product for AR announced
"Help me out, Corning believers: GLW has a place in my portfolio. I heard about them during the Pfizer vaccine rollout, as they were going to produce the vials necessary for storage. In researching them, I discovered that they produce many products that are critical for various industries.While their balance sheet isn't perfect, they do seem to have more than enough funds to continue stable operation. In addition, I get that their stock price isn't exciting.Regardless of their shortcomings, something leads me to have faith in them long-term (and I figured some divvies don't hurt while I wait). Is it safe to say that their products are going to become more important than ever going forward?"
I reiterate that GLW is second only to TSLA in the stock market. The current earnings report proves it.
"OK, I bought back in with 500 shares just below $38. GLW is in a sweet spot, and it does have a dividend coming within days. I knew it got ahead of itself yesterday with the Barron's article, but it is a great company with many cutting edge products. I don't believe the Barron's article said anything about their anti-bacterial paint additive which seems like a potential revenue generator as we will be virus conscience in schools, hospitals, and all public places.Today's give back didn't seem to have massive volume. So that is a good thing.Since I was sitting on around 3K shares, I wanted to take advantage of the pop. Now I will just sit back and let GLW ride. Good luck!"
"From Fatta:Well, well, here we go folks. Same as always going down and down some more. Anybody starting to get what I have been saying?75% owned by institutions. They have learned how to make money doing this. Low volumes shares sold a low prices to down the price then high volume purchases at the low price to ride it back up to where it was.Neat! How they do this!"
Weird how it fell more than the S&P on a day of Optical expansion. My feeling is that optical is sold out for at least 2-3 years if not more. Good thing is that a lot more cheap shares will be purchased at the end of the day tomorrow by DRIP. Another 2-3 million shares removed from circulation.
"OK, I'll keep this simple. 5G is a must have and I am in the business of installing fiber for all of the major companies. we MUST have an unimaginable amount of small cell sites in place to accommodate this because 5G only goes 1640ft from site to site. there is an unbelievable amount of fiber that has to be placed in the air and underground to make all of this happen. Trust me when I say that we are not even close in the United states of having this fiber in place. Cable companies, phone companies and many other service providers have a ton of work of getting the backbone and infrastructure built to make 5G happen. THAT is the reason they say it will not be fully completed until 2025. each of these sites must be fed with a fiber optic cable and this has not even come close to being done. Corning better really get geared up because there is still thousands of miles of fiber to get installed. It is not the technology and it is not the equipment, It is a matter of getting it all in place and installed!!"
Hobo what is going on with glw
@S: Forgot to mention that I have learned never to buy after a big run-up. Always a sell off after a 3-5 dollar run-up due to day traders ( guilty of this too)
"""Saying that the fiber build and improved display pricing make Corning's (NYSE:GLW) long-term targets achievable, JPMorgan upgrades the company from Neutral to Overweight and raises the price target from $39 to $55.""""Chatterjee now says Corning's once ""seemingly aggressive"" targets of 6-8% revenue growth and 12-15% EPS growth will be achievable through to 2025, warranting a premium valuation.""That's what I was looking for, the sustainability (FY2025) to justify it's not a one and done. Also, the premium valuation is warranted. With those 2 items mentioned, hopefully other analysts will follow suit in the weeks ahead. The market, macro, or other events pull back will result in the dip being bought. GLW has had some short term runs FY14, FY17 but the dip was seldom bought.Just my thoughts.~Bubba"
we will be fine
"EU are to pay #$%$15.50 for per vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna, wonder what % of that is being paid to Corning for their specialist vials..."
"I will never understand how this stock performs. Will sell some stock at the next high, whenever that is."
another great day for glw. looks like we are heading to 35 or lower should be in the mid forties
"$GLW aka Corning, wants the $SINT."
"Well, that's the thanks ya get for a good earnings report."
"Looks like GLW is going to get the Barron's Bounce today. The article I read was quite positive, and it pointed out that GLW has a lot of irons in the fire going forward. It is about time that a real company with real earnings is getting noticed."
"accumulated 300 shares recently, hope to see it break 40 in near future."
corning up almost a percent from the open 
Tomorrow's earnings report.
@S: I have owned GLW for 20 years purchased between $1.60 and $5.50. Retired early with all dividends reinvested. I think it is time to sell some soon (170k shares)
"GLW looks like it will bounce back today. Yesterday's drop seemed overdone. GLW will sell all the specialized vials it can make and phone and TV sales will do fine. With 5G, many older phones will not work. My 3G phone had to be replaced before the end of the year. I believe GLW project strong earnings, and the virus explosion will only escalate GLE medical glassware sales. I also like the virus resistant copper infused paint they have come up with. I expect all public buildings, schools, hospitals, et. will jump on this. I don't expect GLW to go into the paint business, but it should be able to license it technology to all the large commercial paint producers. Good luck!"
"What would be happening if they didn't have $5 billion to buy the stock back. Is there any ""buy back"" buying now pursuant to the program or do they expect the price to trade lower? I am a very GLW-positive, long-term holder. Just a little disappointed with the price action. ."
"From Fatta:Does anybody remember this?CORNING, N.Y. -- Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), a leading manufacturer of fiber-optic technologies used to create the world’s communications network, announced today that its board of directors has approved a three-for-one stock split of its common shares.“Our decision to split the stock reflects our confidence that we are firmly established in markets that will continue to grow well into the next decade,” said Roger G. Ackerman, Corning’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Our position as the world’s leading manufacturer of optical fiber gives us a unique ability to co-design fiber and optical components that both increase the carrying capacity of the network and decrease the cost of transmission. We will exploit this competitive advantage by continuing to develop a rapid succession of new products through a combination of internal innovations and external acquisitions.”As of June 30, 2000, Corning had approximately 319 million common shares issued.Do you wonder why the market doesn't like GLW"
I just did a search on hhs.gov for Fact Sheet : Explaining Operation Warp Speed I had no idea Corning has a contract to supply vials. I am buying Corning now !
"Another upgrade from JP Morgan, price target $55. Looks like the analysts are finally waking up!"
"JPM issued on downgrade on limited earnings growth but maintained their $39 price target. Interesting that GLW just said it projected 5 to 8% earnings growth just two weeks ago. That sounded pretty good to me. I like companies with earnings growth during these difficult times. When the economy picks up again, I expect GLW will continue to grow earnings. Good luck."
"U.S. Departments of Defense, Health & Human Services select Corning Valor Glass packaging to accelerate delivery of COVID-19 vaccines"
"The short squeeze is about to happen all across the board. The new rules from SEC are being implemented on most stocks that have millions of those shares shorted without the proper wait period. Many are getting cash violations notification and penalties. So I wouldn’t worry about this nonsense anymore. If you believe in the company just buy and hold it for many years into the future. Like I’ve said, this is the problem that has been a huge problem for many years, but right now it has been finally taken care of."
"Bought more on today's weakness. The new Gorilla Glass, massive vial production for vaccines, US money for vial ramping, and improving TV and computer sales make GLW a stock I feel comfortable owning at this time. Good luck!"
"Were now down 25% from our high and some idiot is drooling over the fact that the company can buy back cheap shares. Just add up the billions that they have spent and look at the rise in pps. They could have purchased high value companies that would have added sales and most importantly profits, that would have driven up the pps and stopped this volatility. This management team needs to be replaced with forward thinking staff."
