what is going on with glw
Tomorrow's earnings report.
"Seems like investors/traders/society wants instant gratification.....Following any hype. The more hype the better.Too bad GLW doesn't fit in this category, but I own it anyway as a stable holding/div."
"One year ago, $31. Today $41. Next year $55. Steady as she goes......"
"Been quiet off lately, last day today to buy shares for the $0.24 dividend on Sep. 29, we go ex-dividend on Monday. Other than that no news to pump up the stock price, just collect the dividend and sleep well!"
"Feels nice to have a good day, and wish we had more. I'm especially anxious and concerned about next week's earnings; perhaps we'll be fortunate, and we won't suffer the usual sharp decline."
"have the potential for a gnarly inverted head and shoulders reversal...will be interesting to see where stocks go now after the treasury auction...really need materials to get in gear...on the worst days for glw, materials often show some responsibility...glw never got up off the mat with materials during their morning recovery but glw did form the head/second shoulderto get an idea of the day: look at CAT for the direction and then look at LYB to see how volatile lol"
"This happens often and that's why were 15% off our all time high, it makes no sense to drop on a day like this."
"Deja Pooh, lol, and/or SSDD"
The news today on Everon puts a new fork in the road for Corning.The #1 issue with 5G is the wireless signal behaves a bit like the old AM radio waves.Interior walls and such block the signal.I have no doubt there will be many players like Cisco who will or do have a similar solution but I'm not as excited about the product itself as I am about Corning entering into a new market because the valuation Wall St. bestows upon those types of companies far exceeds how they value a pure industrial play.For the time being revenues from Everon will be swallowed up in general accounting but if you have the long game in mind and they continue down this road there will be a time when the company will see the wisdom in spinning it off to unlock the value.Another old line industrial giant Siemens has completely reinvented itself and found they could still build locomotives and also sell/license various software components.In a few short years they are doing $4 billion a year and it's growing like a weed.They may well be writing the playbook others will follow.
"Interesting. Twice I've posted my opinion that Corning stock may have gone down due to the administration's and the big 3's as well as other automakers goal of 50% EV production by 2030 because it would affect Corning's Catalyst sales. And twice, the comment has disappeared. Is it being censored? just an opinion, and hardly out of bounds compared to other looney stuff posted not even related to GLW stuff being posted."
yeah might be pennies in front of a steamroller...but holly guacamole just out of the money weeklys when this thing has basically been preprogrammed for this trading range...be careful but glw is a loaded spring right now 
"I will never understand how this stock performs. Will sell some stock at the next high, whenever that is."
This stock gets no respect from Wall Street. Just don’t understand why down or little movement past two trading days with market up???
corning up almost a percent from the open 
Consider under $40 a gift. Shouldn't be a penny under$45.
@S: I have owned GLW for 20 years purchased between $1.60 and $5.50. Retired early with all dividends reinvested. I think it is time to sell some soon (170k shares)
The current one year trend line has Corning above $50 before this time next year. Just sitting patiently. Thank you.
"what lovely person/shop loves hitting that sell button at the market open and close??? Hey buddy, the fundamentalists won't let you blow up the technical picture to create a deeper selloff...look at the open and closing in regards to previous days close and it seems like they are trying soo hard lolhow much more positive news can this stock get to move back towards its recent highs? Surely we can break out of this range!"
I reiterate that GLW is second only to TSLA in the stock market. The current earnings report proves it.
"@S: Agree totally, but will only sell some. Do like the dividend."
could hit 43.00 after earnings
"@Robert: I think anyone would bless what you have done and congrats...you have more than earned your right to hit the sell button@S: Unfortunate that you bought it at $46 as a trade...no one cares if you sellIMO, as you all have seen: I think the future is very bright for the end markets it serves. Think another overlooked part of there business is ownership interest in Hemlock Semiconductors that makes some of the highest quality and cleanest silicon and related chemicalsCorning was literally built for this era!"
"On first blush, Corning's earnings look stellar."
new glass product product for AR announced
hoping for 45.00 by middle of August.
"Buckle up! Exciting week ahead Run-up to earnings, earnings and post earnings price action."
Similar price action with others reporting today. That includes exceptional volume. Many 52 week lows are former highs of those particular days last year. This is probably mostly profit taking by big investors taking a little off the table to save on taxes and maybe buy a new car. Not worried. This is healthy long term.
"I'm beginning to think Display may have issue. 8/3/21 OLED was $230 ish, VIAO was $11 ish. OLED is down today 10% to $210. VIAO tumbled the other day to $7 almost 40% down. Bounced back to $8.50 still down 23%. VIAO is GLW partner in their cold fusion GG auto display mfg. process. GLW overall with diversity in different segments would be less impacted.~Bubba"
"Can anyone offer an explanation, given market highs? Thanks."
"1.40 Swing today in share price. Do they (MM) play us like a fiddle or what.?Hey Bubba, can you quantify GLW's exposure in China? % of manufacturing, sales, etc. Heavens Forbid, If China blows up & decides to invade Taiwan, that's gotta be a game changer for the US & the World. Especially all the American Companies Manufacturing over there. Can't imagine the Impact.!!Doubt if the Corpse in Charge will do any retaliation. Just not very optimistic on the World View of things.Any clarity would be appreciated...GLTA"
I posted 2-3 months ago that I adjusted my avg. daily volume level to 4m. I'm adjusting it again to 3.6m (low 3.2m; high 4m). I don't think any more adjustments will be needed as the Samsung shares have settled in or finishing settling in for the stretch run. Long GLW.~Bubba
"Published in Fierce Telecom on 8/4/21Tried to add link but was rejected.Joe Jensen, Corning’s Director of FTTH Market Development for the Americas, told Fierce the current state of the broadband market is unlike anything he’s seen over the past two decades, with operator enthusiasm high and money pouring in from all sides. But he noted telecoms still face a number of challenges, among these figuring out how to get a cut of all the new funding and finding the labor force to get their projects done.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jensen pointed to the pandemic as a catalyst for much of the current activity, noting it validated the idea that broadband is critical infrastructure and helped spur higher fiber take rates among consumers.“What we had seen up to this point in time was that carriers were really scrutinizing their business cases for deploying,” he said. “What we’re seeing now, though, is that this is kind of pushing things past a tipping point. Folks in rural markets are starting to look at building, folks in underserved municipal markets are looking at building and there’s a tremendous amount of capital flowing into the space – whether through government funding or private equity firms – that’s really fueling that growth.”A report issued by market research and consulting company RVA LLC in July forecast 61 million homes will be passed with fiber in the five-year period from 2021 to 2025, a figure it flagged as more “than in all of FTTH history combined”. Approximately 40.7 million of these were part of its base forecast, with an additional 4.3 million attributed to builds fueled by the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction and 16 million expected to spring from a U.S. infrastructure deal currently being considered by Congress.HurdlesBut even this environment comes with challenges. For instance, though there’s a glut of money available to fuel broadband builds, Jensen said navigating all the different programs is hard. The main issue is “understanding the right fund to use and how to apply,” he said.He also pointed to competition over limited labor resources as an ongoing problem and flagged access to reliable coverage data as another hurdle. The latter is “frustrating our customers as they go to apply for funding,” he said.For operators looking to connect rural and remote areas with fiber, gaining access to middle mile transport is also proving to be difficult. “Really it comes down to middle mile fiber’s not everywhere,” he said. “One of the things we’ve heard is if it does exist, ok that’s one thing that’s great. But it may be owned by an incumbent, for example, and the incumbent may not necessarily be willing to share that middle mile fiber, at least not at an economical rate.”Despite the difficulties, Jensen said there’s “just a lot of positive momentum in the space.” And Corning is already reaping the benefits. The company’s Optical Communications business posted its third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in Q2 2021, with revenue rising 21% to $1.08 billion and net income up 83% to $148 million.Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on the company's earnings call last week it has seen a strong uptick in orders in the optical segment, citing ""year-over-year growth in double-digit percentages in both carrier and enterprise networks."" He concluded ""we believe we're in the early innings of a large capital deployment cycle across 5G, fiber to the home and hyperscale data centers."""
"An I wrong? Vaccine bottle sales have added little to earnings, and we haven't seen a huge boost to GLW's earnings from coronavirus vaccines. Am I wrong? "
"well,well,well here we go again"
Back in. Chart looks good for new entry.
Could GLW also be an infrastructure play with fiber optic cable and connectivity products?
hopefully we hit 43.00 next week
Volume was super high today but this stock is in fact a #$%$ I've had this for 20 years and am incredibly dissatisfied.
"Well, that's the thanks ya get for a good earnings report."
