"ABT will likely finish up 8 to 10 percent this year. Hope the drug pipeline is robust boosting EPS, and up the Divs"
"you realize abbott now has released a covid-19 antigen self test available now at your local pharmacy?....only because a young family member developed symptoms and was diagnosed monday as covid positive using this product, did I pay attention.... the 24 hr cvs pharma was all sold out of abbott test, and one remaining from another unfamiliar company was securely tied with anti theft device (assuming to dissuade shoplifters)...due to a family members positive result I quickly found a pharma off the beaten track and purchased one...for peace of mind."

"Nice accumulation happening. Will test new high. If we break 129, it’s off to the races."

Abbot drug is most economical Covid treatment available
SENS will get over you soon
"ABT is performing more like a growth and not a value company. It will continue to move away from the rest of the pack. With aggressive introductions of high tech devices, double digit growth is expected to continue. While stock price is near all time high, it might just be the begining of a new chapter. Look at what TMO has done in the last 5 years. ABT is doing the same. And it will see very strong price appreciation. Well planned acquisitions, dividend increases, stock split are also factors that will reward investors in near and long term."
