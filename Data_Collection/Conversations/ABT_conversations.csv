"CHICAGO – Abbott Labs is fighting back after one study suggested the company’s rapid test for coronavirus is highly inaccurate.The study showed results from Abbott’s test, ID Now, were inaccurate in near half of the case tested.Vice President of Diagnostics, Dr. John Hackett, called the study an outlier.“As a scientist, ID Now is a remarkable diagnostic tool,” he said. “What I mean by outlier is these results are very different from those obtained and reported on by other research groups.”Abbott officials said at least three others studies and hundreds of testing sites show ID Now is very accurate.The recent study has the company on the defense. Researchers from New York University took nasal swabs from 101 patients and used two devices; the ID Now and a device called the Cepheid.The Cepheid found 31 cases, but the study said 48 percent of those cases tested negative with ID Now.Abbott scientists contacted the researchers.“These authors acknowledge that there was limitations to the testing and recognize this was not a standard clinical style type study,” Dr. Hackett said.Before this study, the ID Now test was best known for delivering results in 10 to 13 minutes, rather than days. It impressed the White House.The FDA said there’s been 15 complaints against ID Now, out of more than one and a half million tests.The FDA said they will investigate this latest study.Suggest a Correction"

My son-in-law fell ill last Thursday with flulike symptoms and went to the doctor for testing. First they tested him for the flu which he tested negative for and then tested for covid. They told him they would not have the results until Saturday. 3 nights he was isolated from the family and worried constantly about who he may have been in contact with. Luckily on Saturday the results came back negative. The test was a Lab Corp test. I can't help but wonder why it took 3 or 4 days when Abbott has a 15 minute test available. Doesn't seem to be widely accessible yet!
What happened to all the recent comments over the last 27 hours? Can't find a reason for the sell off and apparently Yahoo is keeping us from trying to find out.
"Well Biden stated the obvious 1. More testing 2. Vaccine that can be widely distributed will not be available until mid 20213 . Regardless, of all the above, Abbott is more than just a Covid play."

"...Oct 7 (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories ( ABT) on Wednesday released early data from a study on the accuracy of its ID NOW COVID-19 test, which is used in the White House, that could help alleviate concerns the diagnostic frequently fails to detect the virus.Interim data from Abbott's 1,003-participant study shows that its test, which can deliver results in under 15 minutes, correctly identified positive COVID-19 cases 95% of the time when used within seven days of symptom onset."

"ABT will likely finish up 8 to 10 percent this year. Hope the drug pipeline is robust boosting EPS, and up the Divs"
This a great stock to have in my portfolio. All of the people on this thread who are focused solely on COVID testing are forgetting or not paying attention to all the products that have made them such a profitable company long before COVID came around. They are still building and improving the products they already had and that will make Abbott a great buy during the pandemic and long after it has subsided.
"Signs of Hope: Cramer's 'Mad Money' Recap (Monday 3/30/20)Executive Decision: Abbott LabsIn his first ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Miles White and Robert Ford, the outgoing and incoming CEOs of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) - Get Report, the drugmaker that announced a new test for COVID-19 that can produce results in as little as five minutes. Abbott's new rapid test is a game changer for point-of-care testing. The test involves just a nasal swab and five minutes, Ford said, and their ID Now technology will amplify the virus by one billion times so it can be accurately detected. The company is able to process up to 50,000 tests per day and Abbott is working hard to double that capacity. For now, the test will be limited to front-line workers, like doctors, nurses and first responders. Abbott is in talks with federal and state officials to determine how best to deploy the technology across the nation. White noted that while today's test is impressive and much-needed technology, there will be additional tests from Abbott coming in the weeks and months ahead. He said their teams are working day and night to bring not only new technology, but also new capacity, to our healthcare system. When asked whether he had any doubt we'd be able to beat this virus, White said he always knew science would prevail, but it's frustrating that the victory will take months and years to materialize."

"The Walgreens testing will use a device developed by Abbott Laboratories, the Illinois pharmaceutical company, which can render positive results for the coronavirus in five minutes"
"Going red is sometimes good! Why? Because this will encourage more bullish buyers to hold the stock. There are a few panic sellers on the other side, who do not believe that this stock will go up or they are satisfied by the profits they made from this. But technical analyses of the balance sheet and also the current scenario, must actually attract more buyers and see a potential in this stock. My personal view will be that I will be skeptical about this stock if a competitor comes with a similar COVID 19 test kit, and there are chances that there will be a downfall. But this company has been over decades and constantly making some good healthcare products."
"The seven or so analysts covering this stock has given it a 12-month average target price of $84.75 which is where it is today...Therefore, I would definitely wait for a dip before adding anymore."
"Well, after a lot of time spending on reviewing the latest report, and FDA status of products, combined with business analysis of Abbot compared to competitors, it seems Abbot is going to be on the verge of touching the 100's for the first time in about 12-14 months starting from the end of February 2020.

Rest assure testing will increase regardless of vaccination status. Buy with both hands, this could end the year at $150+ Mark this post friends."

"People seem to overwhelmingly view $CODX through the lens of its high-ceiling potential, but in my opinion their high-floor is equally as appealing in this uncertain market. I think we can get a much more complete picture of their position through a basic SWOT analysis. Let’s start by first looking at Co-Diagnostics' strengths and opportunities. They are a company with no debt, a diverse client base with at least 15 states and 50 countries at the time of their q1 earnings report, phenomenal per-unit profit margins of over 70% in spite of being priced very affordably. Their COVID test that, as it stands, is the most accurate, innovative, and least-invasive test within the most in-demand product segment in the world Next, let’s look at $CODX through their threats and weaknesses. Every single negative news article about $CODX I could find concerning their COVID tests revolve around one central idea, the threat of their test found to be anything less than 100% accurate, but all those critics seem to imply the same outcome should this happen, that if the test is anything less than perfect it will cause their test sales to significantly and abruptly diminish to next to nothing. Fortunately for us we have a perfect comparison to see would happens in that scenario through their biggest competitor, $ABT Abbott Labs’ tests, tests which in April were proven to be inaccurate, so inaccurate in fact, that during one mid-April trial the tests were found to give COVID false-negative text results 50% of the time! Despite this fact, you can see through a quick search in google news that they are still currently getting order for those inaccurate tests in mass quantities. So even if $CODX critics' worst case scenario would come to fruition tomorrow, working under the assumption that potential customers of $CODX would react in a similar fashion to the news of Abbott's tests' inaccuracy, would still be in a position to have their demand come close to, if not exceed, their 3 million tests/week capacity. Abbott Labs' example has clearly shown customers will still take a slightly inaccurate test, or in Abbott's case a very inaccurate test, over having no testing capabilities at all, especially when you factor in the added incentive of their appealing price-point. If you even somewhat agree with my reasoning of $CODX's tests' inelastic demand extrapolate the sales numbers from their Q1 earnings report and you will get clear picture that this stock is far undervalued. Investment opportunities like this are few and far between. Not only does $CODX have sky-high potential, but they are also have a very understated level of safety when you consider their lack of debt, quality product, and unbelievable and sustainable demand. The window to get in is now, buy with confidence!"
Let's not forget that ABT's sales have been hurt by the lack of elective surgery. Now that elective surgery is coming back it should restore ABT's income stream from the hospitals in addition to the testing aspect. It will be sales back with pent up demand for elective surgery plus additional income from testing. It's a win win. Not everyone is going to need a cure but everyone will need to be tested worldwide.
"It wasn't surprising that Abbott Labs quickly emerged as one of the top players in the COVID-19 diagnostics market. The company now has six coronavirus tests on the market in the U.S. In the first half of 2020, the company's COVID-19 tests generated sales of $652 million."
“Abbott projects 11% earnings growth for the next five years...”
"The case for Abbott LabsAbbott is poised to make a major difference in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The big healthcare company announced last week that it received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a new COVID-19 test that can provide results in as little as five minutes.The company's new COVID-19 test runs on its ID NOW platform, the most widely used point-of-care molecular testing platform in the U.S. Expect demand for Abbott's COVID-19 test -- and its ID NOW technology -- to soar over the next few weeks and months.Sales are already soaring for one of Abbott's most important growth drivers. The company's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system generated revenue of close to $2 billion, up 70% year over year. Growth should accelerate even more once Abbott wins FDA clearance for the next generation of the CGM system, which will support interoperability with other devices including insulin pumps.Abbott Labs also continues to enjoy strong momentum for several other products in its lineup. The company's Alinity line of lab diagnostics systems has had a successful launch in Europe and will almost certainly be a big hit in the U.S. as additional assays are approved. Abbott's MitraClip device for mitral regurgitation (leaky heart valve) and its HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) are also key to the company's growth.Even with its shares down year to date due to the coronavirus-fueled market sell-off, Abbott's shares still trade at 21 times expected earnings. That's pricey in a market with plenty of stocks with lower valuations. However, Abbott's strong growth prospects make the stock attractive.It also helps that Abbott boasts an exceptionally solid dividend program. The company has increased its dividend for a remarkable 48 consecutive years. Its dividend yield currently stands at close to 1.8%.Investors who are more risk-averse will probably prefer Abbott Labs. It's a Dividend Aristocrat with solid growth prospects. The biotech's pipeline could turbocharge growth over the next few years."
Criminally spectacular mis-management with tests.

"Been in since prior to the ABBV spin-off. The divvy isn't great with ABT, but the stock appreciation sure has been. Dumped the ABBV portion prematurely and kept the ABT portion."
"Technical resistance is actually at 96.98, if we can close above that today and tomorrow, then we confirm the uptrend from a momentum perspective, otherwise fall back to support at 84.50. Good spec play, but I wouldn’t get stuck thinking this is a long term hold at these levels, you’re buying momentum and media hype, the underlying fundamentals don’t support the valuation. And before people compare it to netflix and amazon... ABT is a great company but nowhere near the same class or growth potential to trade at those multiples. Good luck all!"
"Guys this is a low-beta stock. A 10% return is very high for a stock with a beta of 1.15. Just relax it's a solid buy and we're just at the beginning, before millions of tests get administered."
"I've owned Abbott Labs since 1993. Ever since I came within 5 years of retirement and into retirement, if I was going to own only ONE stock, it would be Abbott Labs. It's a steady growth company that's even more ""safe"" after spinning off AbbVie in 2013 (which I also still own).This stock has so many durable competitive advantages from Similac (now the #1 baby formula in China) to hospital pumps to quick disease testing equipment to Diabetic and other Nutritionals.70% of its sales are outside the USA - stabilizing it's overall performance.It's been paying a dividend every quarter since 1928."
"We will eventually know the truth. Right now, I give Abbott the benefit of the doubt. While its record isn't perfect, the company has a solid track record of being a reliable company. My understanding is its 15 minutes test kit needs to be properly use to get accurate results. So that could be a problem for some users."
Great news regarding MitraClip. New highs today.

"ABT lowered sales expectation on June 1st. With Delta gaining speed, look for positive forward-looking update on Thursday’s earnings day as covid -testing is back in full swing."
ABT could still reach $120s range by spring. I will be happy if it ends the year in 120s too. Not that I don't want it goes higher. The stock is not a start-up so investors won't pump it into the moon on hope. It is trading above its normal premium range. Hope it will double from here in 5-7 years. I'm holding it for retirement.

the demand for these tests and growth for this stock will be exponential. Who knows how high this will go.It will be over $150/share by years end is my hunch...
ABT will be making the kits for the government for cost (no Profit) while wasting resources that could be making money. I am happy for the public but why will this help ABTs bottom line and make the stock go up more than just a day or two?

This stock has been outstanding for the last 20 years. I realize that other stocks have outperformed ABT but this seems to be a safe asset for investors.
I thought they had emergency approval for the 15 min test months ago.
Second half earnings will take ABT to $150 making it a good bet. Not many companies positioned to grow with covid concerns rising by the minute.
"ABT is a buy and hold stock. Perhaps forever, to be left as inheritance to kids and grandchildren."
Fenofibrate effective against COVID -go Abbott! Not much coverage but news on Friday…
"ABT $74 stock cannot run faster and stronger than $1.82 stock Aytu. CODX test kit SP went from $4 to $21 Feb 25-28 2020. Aytu $1.82 will run 500% over $9 if Aytu vs CODX for just sake comparison.

The shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) have received a price target increase from $113 to $140 by Cowen. And Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings is maintaining an “Outperform” rating on the shares.
This should be $90-100 a share right now. MM’s keeping it from exploding. Patience.
"MRNA, ABT, and JNJ looking good here. ABT and JNJ are buy and hold for long term gems. G'luck Y'all!"
"$ABT as you can see Abbott's MMs seem to be influencing the price a bit, and they want to have a strong consolidate base at $94-$96 levels. I can understand as the stock quickly appreciated to $100 level and they want avoid sharp pull backs etc..But I think the MMs need to let the stock run a bit and let the market forces do its magic a bit..the stock will attract volume if investors see it is running...it is like a self fulling prophecy.Today we had 55% short volume (much more compared to the last few days). This is the another problem that a stagnant price may attract.In conclusion, Abbott's MMs - you have done a great job keeping a stable price trajectory of this stock..but you also need to pay close attention to the short sellers.. and let the market momentum do its magic..we should get past $115 in no time!!"
Breakout in progress. Small vascular aquisition just announcedand taking place right now. This is the begining of what might be a series of aquisitions that will continue to bolster medical device business.
"Market realizing sp is undervalued. With earnings coming up, great time to add. 130-140 in play near/mid term"
Have you seen the newest Libre commercial? Diabetes business going full blast.
"Binax-Now is the go-to test product. It was the first to launch and the ine people trust most. Having been the first to strike huge government supply contracts, look for a huge increasr in volumes at least through Q2 of 22. With flu season just around the corner, testing will spike even higher. Buy before it’s $160"
Hedge funds are selling because they bet that the worse of the COVID pandemic is over and the demand for diagnostic tests cannot grow forever. It's very simple.
"INVESTMENT THESIS: Strong underlying performance evidenced by sustained strength in organic sales growth. The company boasts high-performing franchises in Medical Devices (with strong growth in Diabetes Care) and Diagnostics (with strong gains in Core Laboratory), while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical remain strategic parts of its total portfolio. We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the MitraClip. We believe in incoming CEO Robert Ford and the rest of the Abbott management team, which has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. Lastly, Abbott has plenty of financial flexibility to pursue mergers/acquisitions and other strategic actions."
"TRUMP KEEPS ON PUSHING THE ABBOTT'S NEW QUICK RESULT TEST KITS, NOW BY PERSONALLY USING IT AND SHARING THE RESULT TO PRESS CONFERENCE!"
"$ABT...The WH Administration is sending $11 billion to help States, territories, and tribes meet the testing goals ...Abbott and its 5-minute test is specifically mentioned in the directive...Abbott is in a great position to get a large market share of this $11B additional funding..https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/united-states-built-worlds-leading-coronavirus-testing-system/"
"As a long term investor, I see Abbott expanding it’s diagnostics branch into many other life saving and health enhancing products and applications. It’s proven what it can achieve with covid while learning a lot in the process. Imagine rapid testing/screening for early detection of other serious illnesses? It’s Libre glucose monitor technology can be used monitor high risk patients in many other situations just as well. Simply said, it’s only the begining."
"I love this company; stable, great management and products, it’s not going to fly 20% in a day but it continues to safely move higher.I couldn’t find a safer company that produces good returns anywhere."

Abbott partnering with BNGO. Possible buyout looms...
Blew past all expectations. Great entry point for 2021. Will outperform sector and overall market with strong forward looking sales in key businesses.
Institutions want this in their portfolios going into earnings next month. ABT is poised to surge on current covid-19 testing and continued focus on Libre-2 (diabetes glucose monitoring device) expansion. And don't forget the growth trajectory for it's mitra-clip world class treatment for heart valve repair. Too much good stuff going here....
$300 stock easily
"If you think ABT is sitting on their laurels with it's newest $5 test, think again. They are two steps ahead of the competition. New, more practical and economical tests will keep coming. Best of all, covid testing is not a make or break for ABT, it's more of a service to the public. Smaller rivals won't have a chance because they have to charge a premium in order to make a profit. Keep your eyes open and your wallets too, earnings are coming in about 3 weeks. Covid testing will not be the financial highlight, it will be Libre and many other devices that will have wall street cheering."
"If the world wants to return to any sort of normalacy, the vaccine is 18 months away at best. Only option is to monitor and TEST, TEST, TEST....7.8 billion people in the world, not everyone will get a test, but some will get multiple test. ABT won't be the only one offering a test, but as you can get there will be a HUGE demand. As I can't comment on the margins on these test, I have to think there will be some...expecting more to come out on this earnings call next week...holding long"
Who were those traders that sold ABT at $61.61 last March? This company will likely get to $1T in market cap over the next decade while increasing dividends around the same rate as earnings and FCF growth (if not higher).
"My son is an Engineer at the Abbot facility in Scarborough, Maine. We are not allowed to have any contact with and neither is his son as we both recently travelled by air from other states. They have moved in beds and supplies into the facility fo the eventuality that employees become required to ""shelter in place"" at work. The work they are doing iat Abbots a key weapon in our nation's fight against COVID 19."
Starting to break out in nice fashion. 128 is the previous Feb high. Business is very strong across all segments. New approvals will strengthen ABT’s revenue. It’s poised for one of several scenarios. 1. Stock split2. Aqusition(s)3. Spin-off of Nutrition/ Established PharmaNutrition is big enough to form it’s own business. The spinoff could easily create. 50-60b cap company on it’s own.
"The company is on track to ship 4 million this month of its new antibody tests, which indicate whether a person has had Covid-19 in the past and was either asymptomatic or recovered, Abbott CEO Robert Ford said during an earnings conference call with investors Thursday. It plans to ramp up to 20 million shipments per month, beginning in June, he said, adding there's a need to manufacture more tests.""It's clear that the demand for testing is big, it's not going to go away,"""
Abt will be one of the big winners of corona crises .....thousands of labaroatory kits will be sold worldwide.I see 100 USD stock.
"I called a great buy @106 when it dipped a month ago. Up $12 dollars in the same period. At 118, it’s still a good entry point. Abbott has plenty of forward looking momentum. Vascular division has been a lagard due to covid resulting in limited elective procedures, but that’s all changing."
"ABT continuing to deliver exceptional share holder value, 25% dividend increase. 3000 shares long - I will never sell!"
How many here also hold Abbvie shares?
Typical ABT.... Always goes down on earnings. Will reach new highs within the next few weeks....
Buy this dip! Thank me later.
Abbott should buy RNXT when the price is cheap. $400 mln @$50 for 8 mln shares will bring them huge profit.GM!
Downgrades are issued to drive the price down. Not to provide guidance to the retail investor!
Curious what Abbott thinks about Lucira and the only FDA approved at-home PCR COVID test? It would be a drop in the bucket to buy them out.
"I am a retired ABT employee. Today I received an email from the company regarding their corona tests:Understanding Our Spectrum of COVID-19 TestsOur comprehensive portfolio of diagnostic tests can identify COVID-19 at every stage of infection. Here we break down how they work.From the beginning, we understood that the war on COVID-19 would be fought on multiple fronts, and that there would be a need for different tests at different stages of the disease. With decades of experience in infectious disease testing to guide our efforts, our colleagues rallied to develop an astounding eight new tests in just under six months.With this rapid pace of development, there’s been a lot of information to process, and many of us are still not entirely clear about exactly when, where, and how our different tests are used. We’re here to help. Molecular and antigen tests help identify active infectionsWhen a person is first infected, the virus starts to make copies of itself, creating higher and higher levels of the virus’s genetic material (RNA) in the patient’s system. Once enough copies are made, doctors can use a molecular test to identify that viral RNA. These types of tests can help doctors diagnose a COVID-19 infection.Our molecular tests include our Alinity m test and RealTime m2000 system, both of which are used for high-volume testing in laboratories and hospitals; and our ID NOW system and test, which can be used in a wide range of point-of-care or near-patient settings, including physicians’ offices, urgent care clinics and hospital emergency departments. It delivers test results in 13 minutes or less. As the virus continues to multiply, the level of antigens (proteins on the outside of the virus) rises. Our newest test, the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, detects those antigens to identify active infections in 15 minutes. BinaxNOW uses proven lateral flow technology similar to an at-home pregnancy test, making it the only rapid antigen test available in the U.S. that doesn’t require instrumentation to produce a result. We’ve also launched the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device, a similar rapid antigen test that also requires no instrumentation, in a number of countries in Europe, and are working with regulatory authorities to bring it to additional countries around the world.Antibody tests can point out recent and past infectionsAs the body starts to fight the infection, it begins to produce antibodies that attack the virus and attempt to clear it from the system. These virus-fighting cells stay in the body, so testing for them can determine if a currently healthy person has been infected in the past. Combined with contact tracing – identifying the group of people who may have come in contact with a previously infected person and should therefore be tested themselves – these results can help slow the spread of the virus.Our first test of this type was for the IgG antibody, which is often longer-lasting in the body after the infection phase. This lab-based blood test can be run on our Alinity i system and our ARCHITECT i1000SR and i2000SR instruments, which can all run 100-200 tests an hour. We are also developing an IgM antibody test for these systems. Outside of the U.S., we offer the Panbio COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device for use at the point of care.Having different COVID-19 tests can help combat COVID-19 at every stage of the disease process. We’re helping diagnose new cases of COVID-19, and identify previous ones, across many settings – from local clinics to doctors’ offices to high-volume labs. Plus, we’ll significantly contribute to the understanding of the virus – knowledge that, over time, could help support the development of treatments and vaccines."
"Abbott raised dividend 25% to .45/share. Wow, simply wow."
Forward P/E is just 20 plus big tax cuts and big sales = $$$$$ going to $75 next year
this company can't make their product fast enough..going higher
"WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - A top Trump administration official said on Friday the government still has confidence in Abbott Laboratories’ speedy coronavirus test, which is used at the White House but which regulators have warned could deliver inaccurate results.""We got 15 adverse event reports ... and so we, at the FDA and the manufacturer, are going to be studying and tracing those down,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox Business Network. ""We've got to get to the bottom of it, but we still have confidence in the test or we wouldn't have it on the market.""The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday early data about the Abbott ID Now test suggested it could produce potentially inaccurate results, particularly by failing to detect people who have the illness. (Reporting by Tim Ahmann, Editing by Franklin Paul)"
"The problem is that the 15-minute test is only approved for those showing symptoms. Initially, it was rumored that it could be used to give access to air travel, live events, etc. If it is approved for people NOT showing symptoms, the usability of the test (and the stock) could explode."
Trump mentioned that Abbot labs testing is great.
"It's a good time to add/buy ABT and JNJ, both have existing strong pipelines and new molecules to treat Covid-19 related indications."
135-140 lurking by earnings. Covid testing is back in full swing.
"“ one of the first studies conducted on the ID NOW COVID-19 test in a real-world setting as it is intended to be used, compared with other studies that have used banked or retained samples.”https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/abbott-releases-interim-clinical-study-data-on-id-now-covid-19-rapid-test-showing-strong-agreement-to-lab-based-molecular-pcr-tests-301063953.html"
"bbott said any problems with the test could stem from samples being stored in a special solution known as viral transport media before being tested, instead of being inserted directly into the ID NOW testing machine. As a result, the company recently instructed all users to only test samples put directly into the machines.""When a direct swab is used, the test is performing as expected,"" according"
"Demand for at-home Covid-19 tests has risen sharply in recent weeks as the Delta variant surges across the U.S., causing test makers to scramble to keep pace."
"Right now, the Snow Clown is projecting $130 by Halloween."
"Abbott has said the specificity and sensitivity of its test are 99.5% and 100% respectively.Italy's DiaSorin has said its Liason XL test has 97.4% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity.There are other tests out there, too.Denmark, one of Europe's first countries to re-open schools, on Monday started its first antibody study, which includes testing 2,600 people, using a kit from China's Wantai.The Dutch Health Ministry said on May 5 it had ordered one million kits, also from Wantai.Italy has picked Abbott to supply 150,000 kits"
Here comes 126
"Questionable test results will be resolved. Remember ABT is much more than a covid test provider. In fact, it's diagnostics division as a whole accounts for a small portion of it's sales. Those of you who've been invested for some time know this. It's the day traders that suddenly showed up that are generating the noise."
Fact we're trading in the green in a red sea speaks volumes.
"Co-Diagnostics, a company with no debt, a diverse client base (at least 15 states and 50 countries) phenomenal per-unit profit margins despite its affordable price, the most accurate, innovative, least invasive product within the most in-demand product segment worldwide. Even if somewhere down the line the tests prove to be less than 100% accurate their current price is still far undervalued considering their sales' trajectory based on extrapolating the sales announced in the earnings report, combined with the fact that Abbott Labs $ABT has proven there is still a strong market for inaccurate tests, 1 study showed Abbott's test had a 50% false-negative rate, yet they are still selling that junk in droves. Somehow people still have their doubts, I am currently living my my life as frugally as possible so I can continue spending every cent I can save to buying more shares every time it dips below $17.50. Get in while you can during this gift of an entry point."
"Went to walmart and cvs for covid test kit. Cvs had two left, cashier stated they can’t keep them on the shelf. Walmart was simply out. On June 1st, CEO announced a drop off in demand. A lot has happened since. Look for a huge upside surprise when Q3 earnings ard announced."
"08:24 AM EDT, 05/21/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Abbott Laboratories ( ABT) has received authorization from Health Canada to provide its COVID-19 antibody test that identifies if a person has had the novel coronavirus.Shipments to Canada are expected to begin this week, with Abbott aiming to distribute 30 million tests worldwide by the end of June.The Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG test is a laboratory-based serology blood test, which Abbott says has demonstrated specificity and sensitivity to detect antibodies of greater than 99% in the 14 days or more after symptoms started."
Added more ABT just now - hopefully they will discloses how many COVID test kit have been used on weekly basis. That should easily push this stock to 85-90..
"the #1 thing the world needs now are high-quality covid-tests, and ABT is able to produce and sell them in large volumes!"
"Unlike other smaller healthcare companies, powerhouse Abbott Laboratories (ABT) hardly needed a global pandemic to raise awareness. The healthcare giant was performing well before the viral outbreak, but a slew of good news has just pushed its share price up to a new all-time high of $100.The company released its quarterly results last Thursday, delivering solid beats across the board. Specifically, revenue came in at $7.7 billion, indicating organic growth of 4.3%, while EPS hit $0.65, 4 cents above the estimates and exhibiting growth of 3.2%. On account of the economic uncertainties due to COVID-19, the company suspended guidance for 2020.The positive print isn’t much of a surprise. Over the last five years, Abbot has beaten top and bottom-line expectations in most quarters.But according to Credit Suisse’s Matt Miksic, the real good news was in the details.“Perhaps the most significant takeaways from Q1 results and management commentary related to the substantial increase in volumes and growth in new COVID-19 tests,” the 5-star analyst said, adding, “We view this wave of new tests as a significant new growth driver for ABT over the next 2-3 years, and expect consensus estimates and growth expectations to rise accordingly in the coming months.”Over the past several weeks, Abbot has launched three approved COVID-19 tests; two molecular tests on the company’s ID NOW point-of-care platform and m2000 lab-based platform and a lab-based serology blood test. The company expects to add two more in the coming weeks; a lateral flow serological test and an additional lab-based serology test.“We estimate this wave of COVID-19 tests could reach annual volumes in 2021 of ~50 mil for molecular and ~550 mil serological, driving significant incremental Diagnostics sales of $2.7 bil and 85c to sales and EPS for 2021, respectively, and continued growth in 2022,” Miksic noted.Accordingly, the top analyst reiterated an Outperform on Abbot along with raising the price target – bumped up from $95 to $106. Upside from current levels is 10%. (To watch Miksic’s track record, click here)All in all, the rest of the analyst community backs up Miksic’s call. A strong Buy consensus rating is based on 9 Buys and 3 Holds. At $103.85, the average price target implies upside of 9% in the year ahead. (See Abbott stock analysis on TipRanks)"
going to skyrocket
I would have thought this stock had split by now. Any thoughts here?
