Well is nice to see a month long base form for DVN. should be a nice platform for the earnings anouncement
Suncor released good #'s for Q3. The future is looking better and better. 4 days baby!
Why does HES have a 19 forward P/E and DVN have a 9 forward P/E??????????
"OMG, I don't want Oil over $80 !!! DVN is a $60 without it !!!!!!"
"Americans are very lucky that we have a good source of oil production compared to many countries. However, 40% of the oil going to refineries is imported. If shortgages result around the world OPEC will/can send the oil to those countries. Even a 10% drop would have a material short term effect but hopefully, the 400K OPEC increases will be enough to supply all countries."
Low volume day. Everyone waiting for earnings.
"Poor DVN oil only $80-$81, so basically we have a $60 stock still trading for $40 !!!!"
"If Devon produces .92 in EPS, imagine the EPS in the 4th quarter when more hedges drop off. I could see 1.25 in EPS. If we have $5 per share in 2022 with a low 12 P/E that would equal a $60 stock. I see this as a very likely possibility of Oil stays above $70 in 2022."
"IMO, DVN doesn't even need today's prices for Oil and Nat Gas to be a $60 stock. Keep oil above $70 and Nat Gas above $4 and we are there or more !!!!"
Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril raised the price target on Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) to $50.00 (from $34.00) while maintaining a Positive rating.
"30%+ in last month. Not surprising to see some profit taking. Agree that $40 is new $30. Time to be patient and let fundamentals work(and look to hopeful great news Nov 2). Looks like FCF is only going upward into and through next year for multiple reasons....takeover integration done, hedges reduced, likely higher WTI/NG, payout from Barnett sale, replacement wells with higher efficiency, etc,etc. Easy(loose) talk about hitting $100 WTI is so wishful..but seeing will be believing. Time will tell. Still seems undervalued along with the rest of the oil/ng industry."
Total stocks are 12% below last year. The amount of crude going to refineries is reduced. Is it because of Hurricane damage or change over for Winter Blends? Any thoughts?
Low volume sell off. Can't be trusted. Investors want Devon and market maker trying to shake out shares for customers.
Devon Energy reached a 52 Week high at 41.41
"Anyone else keeping an eye on oilfield services Co?HAL and SLB have been hitting after missing on some metrics.SLB fell short of FCF guidance.DVN can draw on these guys for drilling and casing, etc. Are Companies like DVN just not spending, and banking the cash from selling oil at these prices (DVN does have a relatively high hedge portfolio).If CAPEX increases for DVN, you can see that money flowing to these Oilfield services companies."
now we're talking: Devon Energy stock price target raised to $52 from $42 at Truist
Anyone aware of any oil companies that have reported earnings? Aside from the those in the oil service sector.
"After all, it hasn’t gotten so bad today ... 7 days until ER. These 7 days will be very long."
heavily underestimated
"Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman warned Tuesday that high energy prices will likely set off social unrest around the world. “We’re going to end up with a real shortage of energy. And when you have a shortage, it’s going to cost more. And it’s probably going to cost a lot more,” the private-equity billionaire told CNN International’s Richard Quest at a conference in Saudi Arabia.US oil prices climbed above $85 a barrel on Monday for the first time in seven years. Gas prices continue to creep higher, nearing $3.40 a gallon nationally, according to AAA. Natural gas prices have likewise skyrocketed, especially in Europe and Asia, prompting the shutdown of factories.Part of the problem, the Blackstone billionaire said, is that it’s getting harder and harder for fossil fuel companies to borrow money to fund their expensive production activities, especially in the United States. And without new production, supply won’t keep up.“If you try and raise money to drill holes, it’s almost impossible to get that money,” Schwarzman said, adding that this is happening on an “extremely wide-scale basis.”"
BofA Securities analyst Doug Leggate raised the price target on Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) to $51.00 (from $40.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.Barlclays has a Buy rating with a $44pt as of 13th Oct.
"There will be a huge energy shortage next decade. Its like we never ever seen before. Its like housing , Its super expensive to drill and get new fields. No bank will give loan unless price of oil make sense. recovery and stabilitization will take 4-5 years and oil price will be over $140 again. Most of the wells dried out. new investments needed for new wells. shortage of energy/food will be the main issue next few years, This is what I see."
Tasty option premiums. Sold today 2 Jan'23 $60 calls for $2.60.
"I stated this a couple years ago and will state it again. IMO, Cheap Energy has fueled the stock market gains, and expensive energy will cause the next recession. Just chart XOP against the DOW and you can see a very convincing correlation."
"Ironic that they want to punish big oil but evn when they cut back a small amount on production they complain about the price. They also claim big oil should pay hundreds of billions in damages but ignore the Trillions of $$$ of economic advancement made off of cheap energy. They can't have it both ways. Oil companies proved this year they can cut back on production. Are these politicians ready for $200 oil during the 2022 elections.......their last election? If these guys think they can bring on enough alternative energy, grid upgrades, and expensive EV's, then they are delusional. They need to work with Big Oil in the transition. They have the Billions to invest in alternative energy. They called for an end of coal, an admirable goal, and then caved as soon as there was a shortage of Alternative energy. We call that poor planning."
Every dip is a buying opp.We are going higher as long as Brandon is in charge of policy
"Technically, 39.76 is the ground.the next target will be $44.Buy now"
"Back under $40, on the other hand RSI is now at 59.I hope on next week we can back to $40+ before ER."
"Importers gaining market share. On rolling 4 week average USA production is up 6.6% compared to last year, and imports up 15%. Producers not ready to open up until OPEC as finished with their 400K per month increases. Anyone know the percentage of production for refinery these days?"
52-week high list would be nice again
"Crude up AH despite so so API report, and NG ripping again today. It looks like many commodities (O & Gs, PMs) are breaking out or near a breakout. PM & mining stocks up solidly today during a risk on day- I haven't seen that in a while. Since Crude broke over 80 on Friday, it's retested and bounced around the 79/80 level 6 or so times. Too early to call it support, but I can smell the combustive burning of oil and gas and smelting of valuable metals as the value of the US dollar embers away in smoke. Smells like inflation to me. $CPE $LPI $SBOW $BP $WTI $VET $PBR $BCEI $DVN $KGC $FSM $BTG"
1/3 into 4th qtr and commodity prices are unbelievable. More than Devon ever expected. It will be interesting to hear their guidance. They will be as giddy as a boy who got his first kiss !!!!
Low volume in the oil patch today. Just a breather.
"Piper Sandler analyst Mark Lear raised the firm's price target on Devon Energy to $54 from $38 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares into the Q3 reporting season. While 2021 was largely anticipated to be a balance sheet repair year for domestic exploration and production companies, stronger than expected commodity prices have pulled forward shareholder return plans, Lear tells investors in a research note. The group is broadly anticipated to reduce capex and execute maintenance budgets in 2022, ""which ultimately should bring investors back to the sector,"" says the analys"
"Once $DVN reaches 100, it will likely trade in a tight range until the end of the decade. But the effective yield of shares purchased today will be upwards of 20%. Cash flow returning to shareholders. Their natural gas assets are some of the best in the world. Never forget that."
They're going to have to replenish Cushing at some point. Half its capacity.
SU up 12% today on great earnings
No surprise that short interest dropped by just over 4.5m to 20.9m as of 15th Oct
"EIA report contradicts to some extent the API numbers yesterday.EIA shows a small draw across crude stocks, Gasoline and Distillates."
"Raymond James as a $54 PT as well:Mizuho analyst Vincent Lovaglio raised the firm's price target on Devon Energy to $59 from $38 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst increased price targets across the oil exploration and production group ahead of Q3 earnings citing increasing confidence in a second half of 2022 call on U.S. unconventional oil growth. Energy is poised to outperform and exploration and production is positioned to lead, Lovaglio tells investors in a research not"
