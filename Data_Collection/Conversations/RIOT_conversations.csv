got some aug 40 calls. would be nice to see riot hit 45 this week. looks like 50k is coming
"I see people doubtfull on my twitter and comments even tho i speak truth and am a technical analysist for multiple people in real life. I post everything with facts. Its going to 58 over the weekend maybe even today. I posted why in recent posts. Again you can be doubtfull or not believed it but the stockmarket is not a place to believe thats how you lose money, with feelings. The chart is showing this, multiple indicators, harmonics, the rsi, the macd, bollinger band. If you sell now or short. Sure do, but your gonna lose money or the biggest profit of your life. There is a short oppurtinity cause the tatget of wyckoff will be 58k and then back to 50k. But this today is just the start. Remember i told everyone days ago. So do you trade stock because you believe or have feelings? Or do you trade because of facts? Im already rich this is also your chance. Call to 58k, put to 50k, call to ath. Just like i said days ago. I told you, dont respect me, respect ta(techincal analysis). Im not a cook or a carsalesman. This is my job#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #btc"
Total Cash and Bitcoin of $195.4M... $195.4M..... Market Cap 3.611B
RIOT hit $40 twice in the last two weeks when BTC was a lot lower. There are many bag holders at higher cost levels big institutions are buying in so why all of the selling now?
Looks like the shorts are still in control of RIOT. BTC drops $2K and RIOT falls 6 points from yesterday's highs. They should just go long and ride this up to the 50s again. A lot of positive news coming out on BTC and how regulation will be good for the industry as a whole.
We have shorts pushing us down MARA doesn't. Look at the intraday chart
this would have been $40 at 10AM for sure.
when is the riot results?
33% short interest and they are still not covering as BTC continues to rise! BTC $50K soon again?
"BTC about to break out! if your not in this by now you will be crying over the weekend, BTC will smash 50k minimum! $MARA $RIOT to the moon!"
MARA and RIOT were equal prices this morning and now $2 separates them. This manipulation is beyond control.
anyone complaining
"$pbts, $any, $sos, $sprt all have huge potential to become primary BTC miners, some will go up on Monday if BTC reaches 47k during during the weekend. Same story with $riot and $mara."
MMs just need to let the stock run! The manipulation on this stock is out of control. A lot of volume on the 35 calls today but the max pain on the stock is thee 38 calls which is $3 out of the money. MARA has passed RIOT by $.75 cents today now! This stock should be well over $40 a share just based on the last two weeks of BTC prices.
Buy in red take candy from shorts
"Just received an email: ""RIOT has an earnings announcement after market on 23 August."" Has anybody received the same email?"
Time to mute Oskar.
"With $50K BTC over the weekend, both $RIOT and $MARA will open 15%+ on Monday!"
"In the past 24h bitcoin has been going down in a descending broadening wedge again, which is a bullish pattern and we are slowly going over to positive momentum. Coming week is look extremely nice#riot #mara #hut #sos #can #btbt #any"
Shorts are digging there own grave. Riot and Mara should be trading in tandem in terms of market cap.Riot will shoot up 10-15% without any warning.
The shorts alone will push riot higher shorts owe so much !
"I just got an email from the company, earnings will be on the 23rd. This is a fact."
Earnings are out. EPS $0.22 compared to estimates of $0.05.Revenue of $31.50 million vs estimate of $30 millionBeat on revenue and earning.
"Bitcoin is on the rise today! But, it doesn't guarantee over $50K by Monday morning. It might not even hit $50K. Or, it could hit $50K and then reverse, who knows. Hoping it does hit the $50K mark and over that, but still not too excited yet. Monday should be fun either way."
FREAKIN' LIFTOFF!! YABBA DABBA...
40 TODAY?
"Okay... now I'm confused as well. When I go to their website to look at their NT 10-Q report, they were not able to meet the 8/16 date to report earnings and have 15 more days to report earnings. They are saying they are late. Why are people saying that the earnings are already out? Are they referring to the July operation report?"
$MARAI've owned RIOT and MARA and it is clear to me now that MARA is the better play.
So RIOT has not traded this low (.069%) ratio of Riot share price to bit.... since the dark days of 5/24.Ironically I think we were waiting on financials bought shares at $30.90 sold them at $32.50. Its still cheap
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Weird move...btc is up and nasdaq is green...short sellers are destroying so many stocks...Noone is watching...sec work for hfs and big banks..
$38 is good but $40 would be great. One afternoon spike in bitcoin and we are there.
RIOT has more revenue and better hash rate and is trailing MARA by $3???Something isn't right
"Approx 48% increased BTC production over last month. Inventory valued at $70M and rising. We're talking a ytd production of 1,748 BTC and rising: that's more than $MARA $RIOT $HVBT $HUT and every other public miner. To say the least, I feel much better about holding cash in BitFarms than letting it sit in a bank account. "
"Earning on or before Aug 21st.Riot SEC filing: States that they will file before 5th calendar day after Aug 16th which would be anytime before or by Aug 21st.The Registrant is unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021 (the “Quarterly Report”) by the prescribed date of August 16, 2021 without unreasonable effort and expense because the Registrant requires additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Quarterly Report pertaining to its subsidiary, Whinstone US, Inc., which the Registrant acquired on May 26, 2021.

been a long time since we have seen $37
$50 tomorrow?
tomorrow should be green if btc recovers past 49k
OK. Let's see what the earnings come out as. Sure hope we don't get burned with an offering. Fingers crossed!
40$ by Friday is still looking like it's about to happen.
42 tomorrow
I have a bad feeling we will see $33 today
"(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTX Corp (OTC: GTXO) (“GTX” or the “Company”), a pioneer in the field of wearable GPS human and asset tracking systems and a supplier of Health and Safety medical supplies and devices, announces collaboration with TulsaLabs, a division of AppSwarm, Corp.

RIOT still well below Monday's highs.....even though Bitcoin has broken upwards.
"can someone tell why Riot is weaker than Mara, thank u"
Guessing the shorts are holding us down as we should be at least 40. When the squeeze happens how high do we go with a 80-100k Bitcoin?
"Woow, this day is first day which looks like finally market taking us as BTC mining company. Same pre-market percents up as $MARA and $RIOT"
"Just as a reminder this is nothing according to ta riot and mara could go to 59, and every other mining stock to all time highs in no time. This is a life oppertunity in earnings the most amount of money you ever made in a week.Dont respect me, respect technical analysis. Every bitcoin stock broke above their 200 moving average. And out of a descending broadening wedge. This is the beginning of the breakout. Every stock could pop easily with 40/50 percent#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt"
Get ready for bit bounce…of course it will be after the market closes.
If it gets to 40 there will be a Parabolic move up.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonytellez/2021/08/19/blackrock-joins-fidelity-and-vanguard-as-a-bitcoin-mining-investor/
I was out of pocket today looks like Mara did the same thing unrelated NVAX went up and down on the same pattern. I knew they wouldn't let it touch $40 for too long
it moved better than i thought we say $37 and $38 then the usual afternoon hit.
"Numbers look good, but what really matters is if “Mikey” likes it."
I would like to see RIOT trade a little more on its own fundamentals like MARA rather than just underperforming BTC.
Riot going wayyyyyyyy down. Anyone can justify price? No one can justify riot price because riot is priced astronomically beyond the crypto and mining assets they own
What is wrong with RIOT??
"Earnings indicate they will be profitable when BTC is less than 40000, next Quarter will be extraordinary when BTC averages 50000 and they are mining at 2.6 EH/s."
MARA stock price is higher than RIOT.....weird.
definitely a rough day but I would rather be holding this then any other miner. Shorts killed us for sure. Target on our back. But this will be up monday- take a look at what happened to BTBT went up a lot people moved to it its now down 8% & 30% last 5 days.
It really seems like trading algorithms have a hold of this stock. It seems like it has been identified as a stock that is easily manipulated for small gains on both sides of the trade.
"Bitcoin drops a bit and Riot rises, Bitcoin takes off and Riot stagnates/falls? Alrighty then… "
50k btc riot struggles to hold 35.
Feeling pretty good about btc and miners - be some nice pay days coming.
They had some interesting insights about RIOT on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Will this get back to 60’s ?
Both industry and retail investors are waking up to Bitcoin mining stock valuations. Bitcoin goes up and down but the miners keep mining and accumulating. That’s a beautiful thing.

Short squeeze incoming for sos according to the chart. #riot #mara #btbt #any #hut #can #sos #hive
"Monday morning I wrote regarding bit coin, mentioned the repeated suppression by NBC, greedy politicians, tech companies, rhymes with Gahoo & Yoogle (not going to mention them - you figure it out). 3X tries to post. ( somehow it was blocked)the point was big events for Bit the media is over looking at that time :1) El Salvador National currency - this will be huge.2) Bank of America & JP Morgan offering to clients.3) Quizinos accepting ( not a huge deal but worth noting)4) Master Card 4) Whales accumulating ( previously we hit $40K & they sold)5) Infrastructure Bill ( dirty politicians wont acknowledge it - but will tax it. they will need it to succeed for their agenda).6) Texas - Displaced miners from China heading there. ( wonder why every company fortune 500 company is head quarter their)7) Miami Florida - started their own & wants to be bit coin headquarter.8) Hedge Funds increasing allocation to 7% ( keep in mind pension funds typical have 10% allocation to commercial real estate) Whales accumulating & El Salvador are the biggest catalyst for the rebound. This week was organic, not tweet from elon which fades 4 day later.+Current Admin Joe B, Grandma yell, warren at odd with it ( talk about being disconnected)+46 Million people have some exposure to Bit -+good luck with reelection if you are trying to beat down the middle class only viable option to create wealth in 2021. * ignore typos- 5th time retyping.Monday i was thinking $50K by October....now Sept. Go $RIOT, $MARA, $HUT, $HIVE, $BTBT, $HVBTF, $AABB, $ETH. $AABB, $SOS... a million others i forgot. Remember when you are trashing most people own a few of these, one succeeds we all benefit. In the words of John Bender.... ""Eat my Shorts"" ) Shorts."
Just sold out of RIOT and moved my money into MARA. 4 reasons:- MARA now mine more- MARA are growing much faster (look at the projections)- MARA hold more than double the Bitcoin- MARA has a lower market cap!Please do your own research but it’s simple maths!
"guy's I'm happy to see Red , because I know it's going to be a bigger upside ! we are going to be so far away from now in the short time"

"Granted, this was 6 months ago but a nice and simple bull case write up of $HUT compared to its ""peers"" $RIOT and $MARA. https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lnguxf/hut_a_safe_bitcoin_arbitrage_opportunity_amidst/"

what do you think Riot will be at when bitcoin hits 1 millon
nice ride
"$CLSK and $RIOT lower than $MARA. Mara will get regulated to death, bad margins, bad percentage of renewables, high costs."
"It's weird how much RIOT is sensitive to BTC when it's declining compared to its total lack of sensitivity when BTC is climbing! Interesting how they keep changing the rules of the correlation game during the past weeks. They're hiring market psychologists at the same pace they're hiring miners!And, it seems that all other similar companies: MARA, GBTC, CAN,... are following RIOT's steps!Previously, BTC price was the biggest factor in deciding RIOT value, in addition to some HF's of course. Now, in addition to BTC price and HF's, we have: RIOT management, paper hands, and petty day traders who don't realize the extent to which they can make money in the medium and long term! Reality check I guess!"
Riot not keeping up with bit I’m out sorry guys. Better investments else were
"Based on peoples reactions to $Hut SP I think a lot of people are going to sell out early. We are up 6%, that's good. We were ahead of $Riot % most of the day, that's good. BTC is gassing up right now to push 50K! Maybe even tonight! That's insane! Just chill... or sell at $8.75 lol. If BTC holds up for the weekend next week should be the moon shot everyone is waiting for."
Riot is the best mining stock !
All through the house not a creature was stirring….they were watching Bitcoin creep towards 50k again.
its still trading at a $2 discount
"Bs, this should be 36 at this value on coin."
"Absolute historical bullish divergence on sos, short squeeze coming soon? I hope you bought the dip on the mining stocks#riot #mara #any #btbt #hut #can #sos #hive"
"Just another Manic Monday, glad it’s not Sunday, because that’s my fun day, Riot going to pay day, 50k coin May Day."
so glad I bought calls when riot dropped down red. 39 calls for next week. looks like we'll pass 39 for a nice profit.
"Earning release Mon, Aug 23rd after close. Received alert from Riot IR."
Zzzzz BITF mined only 51 less than riot..in July.. as sector consolidates you ll discover mara and riot sliding regardless and bitf goes to 2.5x to 3x. Jmo .. been here since December 2020 just my o..
"Difficult day & lots of shorts, I bought more on the many dips - no way this should $32. Earnings were strong, mined 444 bits this month & sitting on cash."
RIOT is setting up for a major breakout on the back of BTC huge moves up.
"BTC down .6% and RIOT down 3.3% the fundamentals haven't changed, they are still mining loads of BTC and are very profitable."
At what point will the 33% short have to start covering with Bitcoin taking off? How does that compare to GameStop before it shot to the moon?
"Btc going down again in a descending broadening wedge, every short will get their #$%$ kicked. Wyckoff 1:1, remember i told you 2 weeks ago. Check the 5 minute chart to see the pattern its going down in again. Sorry shorts, but i told you.Dont respect me, respect t.a. #riot #mara #any #btbt #hive #sos #can #hut"
First short to close will lose least amount of money ! You never know which stonk is next !
"when bitcoin rising, Riot can't rise. This is meaning bad news coming from Riot earning right?"
900 to go in 15 hours. 50k on open should get us 40+
Can you believe the action by Sen Richard C Shelby in his last term in office complying with the big bankers wishes to bury cryptos for the time being by eliminating crypto regulation in the infrastructure bill! Vote out these crypto haters. Get to know who is against crypto. $ETHE $ETC-USD $BTC-USD $GBTC $RIOT
"Most of these shorts have held on since 7/26 in the morning when RIOT gapped up to $33. They've been out of the money for three and a half weeks and the majority have held. They were just in the money 2 days ago. 18 days of 1% interest met and I think they'll cover, however much that is"
Good earnings + Wall Street Bets will likely jump in on good news. Could be fun.
Anyone have a sense of where options are on this & thoughts of where shorts will try & keep the share price?
"On both $MARA and $RIOT, the opening tomorrow would be interesting as cryptos are trending higher and higher …"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Multistockalerts.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
We broke $38 on August 10th last time we saw solid riot Share price # in the past 3 months. we hit $37+ about 2 or so times in August
I am holding this for at least two years selling covered calls when I can.
Guess the real question is when the 33% short interest going to cover? If these big institutions like BlackRock keep buying they could be in for a nasty squeeze? One can only hope! BTC only $1.2K away from $50K again. Miners are minting money to the tune of 500 BTC a month which equates to $25M. Even without all of the new ASICS being deployed that is $300M in income annually.
"July production update was 444 Bitcoin mined. That is more than double from April 2021 which was 206 Bitcoin. As of July they had 2,697 Bitcoin on hand. How can Mara’s market cap be higher?"
So earnings report not released today as anticipated?
Double witching for shorts:1. Btc over $50k2. Riot earning after close
Delay in 10Q???
Just getting started... $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ These have now grown to 8% of my portfolio. My strategy/discipline dictates that I trim a little.. back to 5% or so. I think the crypto proposition is different though. I'll hold until they grow so large it becomes uncomfortable. Any cannabis investors here?$TCNNF $CRLBF $CURLF $GTBIF $CCHWF $HRVSF $MSOS. ...not the Canadian cash burners (no offense to our Canadian friends)... the American market? The MSOs?
Btc just broke down out of its ascending channel since august 27th so nothing major. Its also lacking bearish volume. If it would come back to 47500 where support is we would have a good looking and big reverse head and shoulder. According to wyckoff still a massive pump in 24 to 48hrs. Im not a moonboy im a ta boy#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt #sos #can
"so the reasoning i see in the news is that the bitcoin miners are going down today because ""coinbase users are decreasing next quarter"" ??? Can someone explain this to me?"

Get ready for a major squeeze. Between Riot and Whinstone US. We will blow away the earning.
bit rally after hours tomorrow will be a better day for sure
Hopefully dropping of Bitcoin and other crypto prices won’t affect $MARA and $RIOT that much
Mara has lapped us - never happen...
Monday MARA to open at $36 and close $40! $MARA $RIOT
Can someone check on the short interest on $RIOT & $MARA?
"Riot massive bullish divergence on the weekly, so you can predict the earnings will be huge bought 10 38 dollars call options 10 september ending after seeying this"
Told you massive bullish divergence so the earnings must be good and see what happens
"If Bitcoin holds or continues to climb this weekend, shorts are going to be in a world of pain."

You can also see the hidden bullish divergence on the 5min. Could still break down put of the daimond pattern tho. Ta predicts 70 percents what is gonna happen. But thats the best chances you have. This is only a move for today tho for day traders in the weekend. I expect a massive pump upcoming week. Wyckoff accumilation almost 1/1.#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #sos #can #hut
"So let me get this straight, when BTC is down $2k RIOT is down $2.00, but when BTC regains the $2k it's up $0.11."
Buy more RIOT shares￼. Profit Taking I’ll because of options on Monday mornings heading into the 9:30 AM bell. Those retail holders and institutions who have shares. Do not want option Traders making more money on a percentage basis than investors of shares￼￼
anyone know whats up with bitfarms? down 3.73 hut is up by the same.I understand the profit taking on Bitcoin today from its day highs is beating all of them.
"In the long-term, Riot will likely have to find another revenue source due to limits on the amount of Bitcoin"
Why are RIOT's earning projections so low (.05) this quarter. With all of the extra Bitcoin they have been mining they should be blowing that out of the water by a factor of ten.
Big reverse head and shoulders pattern dating back to the 20th of august#riot #mara #btbt #any #can #sos #hut
"I like what RIOT is doing; however, some recent facts came out that has changed my conviction about their future.These are the facts I'm referring to: 1. RIOT's growth rate in Bitcoin production is far less than MARA. Marathon will have 13.3 EH/s by next year. Almost double to RIOTs hash rate. 2. RIOT holds far less Bitcoin than MARA, which means less chance to earn yield over time.3. RIOT is not transparent when it comes to their business and financials.I hope this helps anybody who is trying decide what to do Monday. It sure helped me. Joshua"

@AAMIR- most of us own/trade both & a month ago the YTD numbers were identical. A week ago the same as well specifically Aug 2 RIOT was up 6.05% vs Mara at 4.16%. Riot is held down for 2 reasons heavy shorting & FUD related to its earnings. The 2 stock have traded back and forth equal complaining from both investor set. Both got killed with Bit this spring/summer. People get frustrated on both then sell when their stock & jump to the other which is up. ( Sell low buy high). Mara is up now due FOMO & fidelity. Solid Miner. BTBT is killing it at 20% + for the last 2 days. ( Riot is underperforming we know)
way over sold. should be 42
A general question for the masses....what do you think RIOT & MARA may do years down the road once all the Bitcoin has been mined? Will they change their business model and shift to something different? I have been pondering this question lately and honestly do not know what the future may hold.
"$45 today, best company to invest in"
I heard about RIOT the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Could hit 100mil in rev next quarter if 75k Bitcoin avg. if someone can find a company with better growth and price potential please post! Only a company with a net profit!
nice btc tanking.
They had some interesting insights about RIOT on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Earnings are probably reported tomorrow after hours. My guess is why the stock has not gone up with BTC like it normally does. Hold tight and you will be rewarded.
$SPRT will be joining the crypto mining party very shortly  I heard they’ll be mining a lot more and a lot cheaper.. but do your own DD and thank me in a few weeks

"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now .

RIOT should be a $60 stock
hut is having a nice run today
Financials:OK I figured this out on 8/12 RIOT filed an 8K with their financials ( income statement & balance sheet) which shows net income of $14MM ( after depreciation)- on a proforma basis due to the acquisition.They have not filed their 10Q ( quarterly) -due to Whinstone Acquisition- so I stand corrected the financials ( for the acquisition ) were proforma based. Not out. I found a notice on the security exchange website indicating the delay & reasons.
"Sure MARA has more hashrate, but if you want to make more money from a stock then HUT 8 mining is the way to go, its gearing up for a 5× jump, its so undervalued. $RIOT $BTBT"
49k coin and we can’t get to 40.
We need to cross $40 again.
It is sad that RIOT can't keep pace with MARA now. Love the gains today but can't help feeling that MARA is the stronger mining stock at this point? Funny though since RIOT is making more profit than any other mining company.
"Many moons since we were hitting highs at the end of the day! With those earnings, we are back into lead dog position."

"I own the financials.. $GS $C $JEF $COF $BK $BLK ...adding when I can to all of them. $MS is quickly becoming my favorite horse in the race. Additionally, I'll be holding $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT ...probably....forever. gl2a."
40 by Friday?
"Not that I’m not happy, but we should be higher."
Second largest U S mortgage lender will now accept btc.
LOVE U $MARA AND $RIOT. YOU ONE SEXY THANG!
I did some high level calculation and we should be getting a revenue of about $36M or so which is 20% higher than the estimate. I could be wrong but I sure hope I'm right. GLTA holding

"(Massive shorts squeeze to 58k incoming) Weekly bollinger bands have crossed, monthly already crossed and opening further. At the top of the descending broadening wedge, we also had two daimond patterns on the 30 min chart. This is gonna be the biggest boom to the upside. All this will happen today or over the weekend. Remember wyckoff. Targets exactly 46400 bounce off to 58k back to 50 and then boom to all time highs. Make calls of the 58k boom and puts back to 50k and then calls to all time highs. Technical analysis and will be respected. #btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
"Panic sell today, buy puts"
Adding to all of my crypto positions $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ before the weekend... I've seen that movie before. Holding thru the weekend has paid. Uptrend intact. Expect that to continue.
MARA is now $3 more than RIOT shares! This manipulation against RIOT is too much.
So 2 week ago the reported estimates of $14MM net income now $19MM first time i have seen actual blow away estimates.
Last time to buy at these prices#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #sos #can #hive

BTC will drive the shorts. BTC is headed over $50k soon
So riot goes down twice as fast as Mara but only goes up by one third. Yeah out riot doubling up on Mara

Absolutely killed earnings reportHuge growth Massively undervalued 
"Core Scientific mined 928 BTC in Q2 2021, and 1,683 BTC in the first half of 2021.- Core Scientific anticipates fiscal year 2021 revenue of $493 million and adjusted EBITDA of $203 million.

"Delay in reporting earning is due to Whinstone acquistion.Here is the info from SEC filing:Registrant requires additional time to complete certain disclosures and analyses to be included in the Quarterly Report pertaining to its subsidiary, Whinstone US, Inc., which the Registrant acquired on May 26, 2021"
When hedges turn on their boyfriends it will be a huge day for foot!
.10 cents between RIOT and MARA now!
40s been the hard resistance. Likely won’t breach until Monday if Bitcoin decides to keep running. Institutions are quick to make these stocks more volatile to make it appear as if there are a lot of day traders. Volatility=profits for the algos. Keep HODLing.
So bit is heading down and this is going up ( for now).... shorts perhaps??
....anyone complaining?
"Not that I trust the media but look at the crypto map for Pakistan $RIOT, $MARA, $HUT, $BTBThttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html"
"BTC up over 10% these days, RIOT will follow suit up 2x than that:Target $55"
Blessings
MARA or RIOT?Which one folks?
believe it or not impressed with RIOT today go fight for $38
oskar is like a more slow version of riaz
The baton passes to the us to keep the btc rally going

"Tossed between buying RIOT, MARA or HUT. has anyone done any research on theses as to which are a better investment?Maybe just buy a little of all three."
You have to like today's trading action in RIOT based on a tough BTC day. If BTC takes off back to $50K that could be what we need to continue the run back to $40.
Be in the 40's soon.
Riot will be $45 in days ! IRS says miners will report so what!
"the NON-GAAP income definition helps a lot in showing the true value of the stock. GAAP is not always suitable for each company. Besided that, I think MARA is currently undervalued when you compare it to RIOT. RIOTs current bitcoin production is roughly on the same level as MARA while MARA already has almost 3x more bitcoins on the balance sheet. The future looks bright for MARA because they have a lot of miners in order and there will soon be a wide gap between MARA and $RIOT in the amount of bitcoins mined per month. The market CAP of RIOT is currently higher what doesn't make sense in my opinion. I am buying extra at market open."
$50 tomorrow
Bye Mara…
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
40+ soon. BTC needs to finish consolidating and keep on trucking..... let’s go.......
I don’t know what I would do without my daily emails from (http://trademarketview.tech)! They help me make the most of my trades and never let me down! Don’t know how I ever traded without them!
"You don't need to be a talented trader to see what is happening in the crypto mining stocks. Covering is starting. BTC down, bouncing off support. Bullish momentum all across crypto.I see RIOT 60$ within a month with BTC breaking 50k and revisiting low 60ks."
Looks like Mara got added to some fidelity fund. That got people all excited. I saw something that Mara bought a bunch of machines for 1/3 of the average cost. That seemed weird. You get what you pay for. Bitty will like blow past $50 during the weekend. On Monday it will decrease in price. This is bitty’s typical behavior as I have monitored it all year. Maybe it does to same again or maybe it doesn’t. May pick a little more of riot on Monday. It will take off soon enough.
They had some interesting insights about RIOT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Perfectly bounced off of 46400 according to wyckoff and the weekly descending broadening wedge, everyone who is bearish is wrong. Simple ta. Target really fast to 58k then back to 50k before bouncing to all time highs. #btc #riot #hut #mara #btbt #any"
WOW THEY SMASHED EARNINGS! THIS SHOULD BE AROUND 60! HOLD ON TIGHT CUZ WE GOING TO DA MOOOOON 
we cross $38 it explodes if not we traded sideways
"Why RIOT drops while BTC is up? It is simply people expect BTC will hit the resistance at around 47K and pull back. But, that is when they are so wrong. BTC will push through 47K and run straight to 55K. Everyday you hear countries, institutions, big/small companies, high/low profile celebrities, billionaire, millionaire, rich/poor folks, and etc. jump on the crypto train. Just buy and hold. You don't want to miss the train..."
MM?s holding this down.. No way this shouldn?t be way up on today?s ER? #$%$ kidding me
RIOT should be trading at $40 this is a good entry point
"Riot Blockchain Inc · Earnings release date · Q2Monday, August 16, 2021"
"OK I thinking ""bipolar"" ( no offense Riaz) from my last post w/ bit dropped last night, news is discussing profit taking from whales. ( I was originally thinking a modest price correction hence $45-46K) Implying a drop.My thoughts:#1 Searched up whales activity they are not selling but looks like more holding...........#2 $2.5 Billion options expiring at $44,000 tomorrow ( hence MM pushing bit down). Last month was a blow out b/c of this Thoughts or insight view point on BIT the next day or so ? i was originally thinking down but not mid to high $47K then back up to some insane number.Go $RIOT, $MARA, $BTBT, $HUT, $BITF and others I am too lazy to mention. We will see."
funny how ppl are mad riot didnt move today when riot went up 5 percent yesterday on a red btc day...
https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/112/riot-blockchain-announces-july-production-and-operationsSolid mining figures
For everyone who bought calls im happy for your earnings big time. Wait till btc is at 58k for a put to 50k and then a call again to all time highs#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #hut
Bitcoin rising… Nasdaq rising … riot should close green today
$40. I am dreaming of $40 today. Have not seen it in awhile.
"(Past 24 hrs) Btc Went down in a descending broading wedge. We broke to the upside, back in the ascending channel and broke down again(without bearly any bearish volume even more bullish volume) Forming a daimond pattern now. Making higher lows in the chart and lower lows on the rsi. This is hidden bullish divergence. Because this is happening in a daimond pattern i expect a huge pump. And dont forget we are following wyckoff accumilation almost 1 to 1.#riot #mara #btc #any #btbt #hut #can #sos"
Excellent situation!
riot earning today.
Lock your shares from the short play. Setup an active SELL (GTC) @ at very high price. Doing so locks those shares out and the shorts cannot borrow them. Just remember that active order is there when price shoots up. My shares are locked SELL GTC @ $101If it triggers I won’t be mad and I’’ll still be a happy camper.
OK- kids. the earnings have been out since last thursday. pretty solid. link belowhttps://www.riotblockchain.com/investors/sec-filings/all-sec-filings
"we know forward revenue for 2022 of this company with their microgrid busines will be something between 250-300 millions with profit margin around 70 percent , my questions are :A, will they buy/acquire some microgrid / solar company to be one of the top company in given segment with new acquistion ? or what they gonna make with this money ? I would say this is huge upside of this company in comparison with $MARA or $RIOT because they could have huge profit but their are still only miners B,what is your target market cap ? My plan is sell some stocks for profit on 850 millions of market cap and then hold till they will hit 2 billion market cap for very long time"
"I have to stop watching the news, google anything you believe to be true & do fact check.( you will be told you are wrong) ....BTC will rise ingore the news. As an example tons of people are crossing the border CNN< CNBC"
"HUT, MARA, BTBT and RIOTWith the recent ban on Bitcoin mining in China, Hut 8 has nearly doubled its market share and is currently producing approximately 10 Bitcoin per day.Aug 15, 2021As of July 31, Hut 8 now holds 4,123 bitcoin worth over $197 million in reserve 4123 * 48000 = 197.904 millions"
"Invest now, these prices are not going to be here long"
"Sean, what do you make of all the insider transactions? Usually with companies it’s selling, but the Riot bunch were all buying shares. Must be drinking the Kool aid I sent them…lol."
Btc broke out to the upside of the falling wedge with the target of 47200 exactly hit as the bottom in the formation. Bullish divergence now. Lets look for some upside the upcoming hour. #riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #sos #hive #can
Riot should be trading at $42-$44/ share as we speak…. 
"Like i said no volume in the breakdown. So now it broke back up out of the descending broadening wedge, now kissing the the edge top side of a daimond pattern, for it to go back in its upwards channel. Massive pump in 12/24 hours? I believe so. Dont respect me respect ta#riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #can #sos #btc"
Descending broadening wedge on the 1h chart of btc now bullish time boys#any #btc #riot #mara #btbt #hut
Sooner or later shorts get squeezed. Headed over $40 soon then on our way to $100 by EOY.
@frank- agreed but Riot is fighting to move up which is actually impressive $1 higher than where it normally trades.
"Riot: 2687 bitcoin Mara: 6,225.6 bitcoin Right nowIs this correct?"
Baby steps in the right direction. Move up slowly and HODL!
"I think the riot boys are in a different business then Bitcoin mining, bit is up and the stock doesn’t follow."
What's the hold-up RIOT?
On CNBC pre market volume it says earning reports today after close
btc red riot may go green. let#$%$ 40+ by Friday
This week plus 45 dollar
"Ok, just stop fooling around, take out the high of the day (37.30) and let’s light this candle￼!"
Massive superpump in btc any day now. Wyckoff 1:1#riot #mara #btbt #any #hut #sos #hive #can
Riot should be green today
"$MARA, $COIN, $RIOT, $EBON, $HUT, $BITF, $HVBT, $ANY... the 2nd half of '21 should be stellar... time tells all truths..."
"Btc breaking on of the small daimond to the upside and thus breaking out of the massive deacending broading, almost every other mining stock breaking out of their descending wedge. Massive pump possibly tomorrow or over the weekend target 58k. Buy now for your gains, remember i told you.#btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
"June 2021 – December 2022 - The publicly announced outstanding orders of 58,500 S19 series miners are expected to be received and deployed through Q4 2022 and are expected to raise Riot’s total operational hash rate capacity to approximately 5 EH/s by the end of 2021, and 7.7 EH/s by the end of 2022. Riot expects to then have a fully deployed fleet totaling approximately 81,150 miners.Why would anyone sell when by the end of the year they will have 5 EH/s. This stock owns their own mining facilities. Mara pays rent for their miners.We host other miner’s"
they shorted and tried to scare people with news acquisition news from may as an offering. that's really sad and desperate.
Buy in the red hold!
"Just a tad oversold, you think?"
How Mara have a higher market cap than Riot? Riot produces more Bitcoin and also provides hosting. Makes no sense.
"Still the easiest stock to play, buy red sell green every dam time in this trading range now 185% in two weeks doing that. Look at $Mara and $riot calls. Its a simple game sometimes."
Bought a bunch today
"Although earnings are fantastic, major moves up are driven by Bitcoin. RIOT however is becoming more stable with each mined Bitcoin."
Is this going back into the $70’s?
Short will be overwhelmed monday
"Looking forward to earnings release, it may not affect price that much but it will help."
"Excessive drop in RIOT relative to Bitcoin - I’ll continue nibbling on down ticks. Buy weakness, take profits on rallies."
oh boy got weekly options expiring next fridat for 39 calls. up 65% already lol.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Rightpicker.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

Start of something big.
"Found a great video on current miner count for Riot and their earnings potential. If you believe BTC will continue to go up, then Riot is undervalued.https://youtu.be/yYRLB946vf4"
I’m gonna be so rich
Are shorts ready for $45 open tomorrow? BTC moves over $50k and earning are amazing. Watch for a bomb to drop for shorts.
August 22 2021 full/blue moon third full moon of season of four moon or second full moon in a month shorts are cooked
Organic growth let’s show Mara what’s what. Both good but we lagging. Need a twin scroll to boost this up. Let’s go!!!!!!
Dangerous game shorts are playing…
Look for a pop over $50+ soon
this is running pretty well if bit can climb to $49K would be huge
"Why is the shareprice not rising AH.Btc up, earnings top, shareprice flop.."
Whitestone earned $125.1 million during the Texas ICE storm buying selling electricity back to their electrical provider.They did not receive all 125.1 in fiat but will receive credits against electrical bills starting in 2022.That should increase profits in 2022 when BTC is priced much higher than $50K.See page 17 of 51 in the earnings release

"Broke out of the daimond pattern to the upside made a quik 8k today and holding my 10x leverage call, i love bitcoin baby#riot #mara #hive #hut #btbt #any #can #sos"
RIOT $37 a share on Monday and BTC was $46K and now RIOT $31 a share with BTC at $45.7K. So much manipulation.
"NCTY is officially in the NFT business, the good news just keeps rolling in :) Its go time NCTY just keeps pushing upward... When lambo? $mara $riot $btbt $mstr $ebon $sos $bitf $bfch $lglof $btsc $can $hvbtf"
"I LOVE U $MARA $RIOT, I LOVE U SOO MUCH. SO MUCH BABY GIRLLL!"
"Hey guys.. it's the end of an era. I'll always remember the season we shared together, pulling for BitFarms to catch fire and gain the notoriety it so obviously deserved. We hoped against hope, and believed in something long before it manifested. It's a new day. We have more volume than $RIOT now and millions of new investors will be pouring in to the forum, jumping aboard the hot new thing.. It'll never be the way it was before, but hey we knew this day will come :) Enjoy holding to your hearts content! I'll be spending more time on forums of some lesser known stocks and cryptos that I hold.. and may perhaps pop on here from time to time (especially during inevitable pull-backs to help fight the fud.) Smooth sailing from here tho! Love you all, and of course, will be seeing y'all in the triple digits. Peace!"
I still think we will see $50K over the weekend
Here comes what nobody expected
