"(Massive shorts squeeze to 58k incoming) Weekly bollinger bands have crossed, monthly already crossed and opening further. At the top of the descending broadening wedge, we also had two daimond patterns on the 30 min chart. This is gonna be the biggest boom to the upside. All this will happen today or over the weekend. Remember wyckoff. Targets exactly 46400 bounce off to 58k back to 50 and then boom to all time highs. Make calls of the 58k boom and puts back to 50k and then calls to all time highs. Technical analysis and will be respected. #btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
Btc broke out to the upside of the falling wedge with the target of 47200 exactly hit as the bottom in the formation. Bullish divergence now. Lets look for some upside the upcoming hour. #riot #mara #btbt #hut #any #sos #hive #can
"In the past 24h bitcoin has been going down in a descending broadening wedge again, which is a bullish pattern and we are slowly going over to positive momentum. Coming week is look extremely nice#riot #mara #hut #sos #can #btbt #any"
"Aftermarket a little run…can’t wait till next week. Good weekend to the board, it was a fun week!"
"Just as a reminder this is nothing according to ta riot and mara could go to 59, and every other mining stock to all time highs in no time. This is a life oppertunity in earnings the most amount of money you ever made in a week.Dont respect me, respect technical analysis. Every bitcoin stock broke above their 200 moving average. And out of a descending broadening wedge. This is the beginning of the breakout. Every stock could pop easily with 40/50 percent#riot #mara #hut #any #btbt"
"HUT, MARA, BTBT and RIOTWith the recent ban on Bitcoin mining in China, Hut 8 has nearly doubled its market share and is currently producing approximately 10 Bitcoin per day.Aug 15, 2021As of July 31, Hut 8 now holds 4,123 bitcoin worth over $197 million in reserve 4123 * 48000 = 197.904 millions"
"I see people doubtfull on my twitter and comments even tho i speak truth and am a technical analysist for multiple people in real life. I post everything with facts. Its going to 58 over the weekend maybe even today. I posted why in recent posts. Again you can be doubtfull or not believed it but the stockmarket is not a place to believe thats how you lose money, with feelings. The chart is showing this, multiple indicators, harmonics, the rsi, the macd, bollinger band. If you sell now or short. Sure do, but your gonna lose money or the biggest profit of your life. There is a short oppurtinity cause the tatget of wyckoff will be 58k and then back to 50k. But this today is just the start. Remember i told everyone days ago. So do you trade stock because you believe or have feelings? Or do you trade because of facts? Im already rich this is also your chance. Call to 58k, put to 50k, call to ath. Just like i said days ago. I told you, dont respect me, respect ta(techincal analysis). Im not a cook or a carsalesman. This is my job#riot #mara #hut #btbt #any #btc"
Just getting started... $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT $BITQ These have now grown to 8% of my portfolio. My strategy/discipline dictates that I trim a little.. back to 5% or so. I think the crypto proposition is different though. I'll hold until they grow so large it becomes uncomfortable. Any cannabis investors here?$TCNNF $CRLBF $CURLF $GTBIF $CCHWF $HRVSF $MSOS. ...not the Canadian cash burners (no offense to our Canadian friends)... the American market? The MSOs?
RIOT has more revenue and better hash rate and is trailing MARA by $3???Something isn't right
Earnings are out. EPS $0.22 compared to estimates of $0.05.Revenue of $31.50 million vs estimate of $30 millionBeat on revenue and earning.
We have shorts pushing us down MARA doesn't. Look at the intraday chart
MARA is now $3 more than RIOT shares! This manipulation against RIOT is too much.
"Earnings indicate they will be profitable when BTC is less than 40000, next Quarter will be extraordinary when BTC averages 50000 and they are mining at 2.6 EH/s."
40s been the hard resistance. Likely won’t breach until Monday if Bitcoin decides to keep running. Institutions are quick to make these stocks more volatile to make it appear as if there are a lot of day traders. Volatility=profits for the algos. Keep HODLing.

"NCTY just keeps pushing upward... looks like it’s happening :) $30-$40/time. Been trading at these levels for so long, and the float is bought! Let’s go! To the moon! $mara $riot $btbt $mstr $ebon $sos $bitf $bfch $lglof $btsc $can $hvbtf"

"Perfectly bounced off of 46400 according to wyckoff and the weekly descending broadening wedge, everyone who is bearish is wrong. Simple ta. Target really fast to 58k then back to 50k before bouncing to all time highs. #btc #riot #hut #mara #btbt #any"
A general question for the masses....what do you think RIOT & MARA may do years down the road once all the Bitcoin has been mined? Will they change their business model and shift to something different? I have been pondering this question lately and honestly do not know what the future may hold.
MARA and RIOT were equal prices this morning and now $2 separates them. This manipulation is beyond control.
"NCTY is officially in the NFT business, the good news just keeps rolling in :) Its go time NCTY just keeps pushing upward... When lambo? $mara $riot $btbt $mstr $ebon $sos $bitf $bfch $lglof $btsc $can $hvbtf"
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Bitcoin is the future! Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.

"Many moons since we were hitting highs at the end of the day! With those earnings, we are back into lead dog position."

"Btc breaking on of the small daimond to the upside and thus breaking out of the massive deacending broading, almost every other mining stock breaking out of their descending wedge. Massive pump possibly tomorrow or over the weekend target 58k. Buy now for your gains, remember i told you.#btc #riot #mara #any #btbt #hut"
MMs just need to let the stock run! The manipulation on this stock is out of control. A lot of volume on the 35 calls today but the max pain on the stock is thee 38 calls which is $3 out of the money. MARA has passed RIOT by $.75 cents today now! This stock should be well over $40 a share just based on the last two weeks of BTC prices.
$MARAI've owned RIOT and MARA and it is clear to me now that MARA is the better play.
900 to go in 15 hours. 50k on open should get us 40+
Both industry and retail investors are waking up to Bitcoin mining stock valuations. Bitcoin goes up and down but the miners keep mining and accumulating. That’s a beautiful thing.
For everyone who bought calls im happy for your earnings big time. Wait till btc is at 58k for a put to 50k and then a call again to all time highs#btc #riot #mara #btbt #any #hut
It is sad that RIOT can't keep pace with MARA now. Love the gains today but can't help feeling that MARA is the stronger mining stock at this point? Funny though since RIOT is making more profit than any other mining company.
$40. I am dreaming of $40 today. Have not seen it in awhile.
"BTC down .6% and RIOT down 3.3% the fundamentals haven't changed, they are still mining loads of BTC and are very profitable."
Btc just broke down out of its ascending channel since august 27th so nothing major. Its also lacking bearish volume. If it would come back to 47500 where support is we would have a good looking and big reverse head and shoulder. According to wyckoff still a massive pump in 24 to 48hrs.
