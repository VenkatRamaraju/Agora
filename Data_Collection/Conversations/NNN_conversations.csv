Jeffries raises target price to $50 from $49.
Liking this companies handling of funds and dividends. What scares me is the rising interest rates with a possible upcoming recession. The top 5 of the portfolio may be the worst companies in a recession. I'd like to hear something other thoughts.Cheers.

"SOLD - Price has two more div's built in. It will likely be called in Jan and the price will revert to $25. Why wait till June, put the loot in your suit! They will put out another Offering and you can buy it several $ at discount. Rate will likely be 5.1% or so.I'll buy back in then, at discount. That leverages up the cap gain, then collect div's for 5 years. Buy in chunks. GLTA"
NNN reached a new 52 Week High at $46.91
"I'm at a loss for words on the relentless stock price drop. Is it because of the word ""retail"" in the company's name? Sure, Gander Mountain leases are an issue but this REIT has a relatively diverse tenant base. I'm hoping that they meet expectations for the next quarter and there is some recovery in the stock price."
I am looking at this based on Seeking Alpha recommendation.....new to REITs....concerned by the 167% payout ratio could put yield at risk....appreciate any thoughts on how to think about this?

What is the best commercial real estate short etf like DRV?
NNN-PF at $22 today. That is a yield of 5.90% +/-. When they call it (2021) or later they give you $25 per share. Plus the $1.30 dividend per yr. Moodys rates it at Baa2 (Inv grade). I added shares.
How about diversifying into a strong mortgage reit best of breed yielding 11.80 percent.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4237275-new-residential-investment-best-breed-11_8-percent-yielding-mortgage-reit-top-pick-2019
"NNN-PF a screaming buy here, I have been adding. Yield at 5.7% at $23.12. 4 years div remain plus the added $2 in appreciation. Don't get sucked into the ""retail"" is bad vibe out there, these are stand alone locations with goods and services that Amazon can't deliver (LA Fitness, convenience stores, etc) check out there portfolio. Income good and steady. I am an individual investor."
Yeah Im sure retailers are going to do great this year
National Retail Props is up 4.98% to 33.60
NNN reached a 52 Week high at $50.99
Your opinions please.How does NNN compare with STOR?Looks like they are in the same markets.
Why the big drop today to 55
Approx 4.4% of their portfolio are Theaters according to annual report. With Cinemark/Pacific Theaters closing....any ideas how this may affect business going forward?
"NNN gets about 4.6% of its monthly rent from a company called ""Mister Car Wash"" that recently converted the interest payments on its second lien term loan from cash to P-I-K (pay in kind), meaning that they are paying their interest in more bonds.Mr. Car Wash is their second-largest tenant.aa"
"Started a position today on a limit order I'd forgotten about, lol. I got almost the low for the day though. P/FFO is below it's avg., with double digit% FFO increase est. for FY2021. Rock solid rising divs, nice yield...works for me %^)."
why all health care REITS tanking today? also some non HC REITS. anyone know?
Stable value paying 4.4% dividend at current price.
Looking for a better safer yield that pays 7.8% how about a a diversified fund that has been around for 15 years a closed end fund trading at a discount to NAV. UTF is the ticker symbol https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-5-best-stock-funds-for-99-dividends-and-10-upside-cm1089685
