"Earnings of $1.50 per share for 3Q vs expectations of $1.19. @Paula, that sure sounds like lousy management, doesn’t it?"
"Paula, do you even read reports or listen to conference calls? I’ll point out just one of your many misleading statements. You say Frost sucks because its loan book is geared toward energy markets. Did you realize they significantly cut energy market exposure over a year ago? If Frost was doomed due to energy exposure, it would have gone under over a year ago."
"Their previous CEO was a better leader, IMHO."
bkj paula...you are a shred investor. I can tell. I would like to offer you sixty five a share for all your shares. thanks
"Takeaways from conference call on 3Q:2020 earnings: good solid organic growth in both loans and deposits. Energy loans continue to run off and now constitute 9% of the portfolio vs. 15% not that long ago. Duration of new securities is shorter than in previous years. Management taking a 10% pay cut and also cutting back bonuses for execs. Incentive accruals down for 2020 in light of earnings projections vs budget. Problem loans down. Houston expansion coming steadily online and contributing significantly to organic growth. In summary, this is what sound management looks like."
"CFR closing in on a 15 year low..........this is only halfway from the 2008 financial crisis levels. I find it unbelievable CFR is going to break $70, if does this could be $50 in a few weeks. No Mgmt in sight!!!!!"
Maxine Waters out final nail in bank stock coffin.....Heading back to $91....seems I am posting to myself.
"Well no, Paula. CFR President was not on CNBC, the CEO and Board Chairman was. He also was on to talk about the PPP loan program and not oil. Then again you tend to ignore most facts about Frost in order to try and make the company look bad."
"why did MS downgrade CFR today, what report or basis. Stock just started to move up and now drops back and most likely under $100."
"This investment of mine makes no sense. Texas as a state is booming, low unemployment, attracting business, rated #1 state to do business on CNBC. CFR earnings report was up on all metrics, held guidance for the year. Yet stock price is trapped in this tight trade range....$111--$114. Everytime we get close to $115, stalls and drops back down. Why we can't breakout to the get back to the highs from prior to quarter results, $118.75 is beyond me. Any serious thoughts out there to help me make sense. Dead Money, Day Traders holding price down, or there is something fundamental I am missing.Thanks"
and yet another down 5% down day.........when does it end........bankruptcy? Most banks down 30% but not CFR they are down 50%. There is no justification for this to keep dropping without a single word to investors from the muted management.
"My TD account is showing Trade Halted on CFR but seems to be wrong, looks to be trading....anyone else see this on their trade services?"
"How does CFR announce fairly strong earnings, beat estimates by about 4 cents a share, and drop 3%?"
"Most banks reaching new highs, CFR down again. Even the Fed news can't get CFR moving up....only knows one way and that is Down!"
Cullen/Frost Bankers reached an all time high at 131.13
"CFR needs to bought out by another bank...........no hope with present management and their ""spend strategy"". Mid to Low $80's coming soon AGAIN!"
Ain't no one saying anything about how the market is down 3.43% while CFR is green today...
In light of the BB&T and Sun bank merger it is time for CFR to step up its game either buying or be bought. IMHO USB would be an excellent fit if CFR can not find anyone to buy..
5% yield now.
"Just bought some more CFR. When the economy picks up, they will be again at the forefront."
"This stock is down 20% over the last six months. Supposedly CFR was going to engage in some buy-backs; well, this would be the time! I really thought we'd hit new lows in the low 90s, but now we're trending into the low 80s. Is there no bottom here?"
Frost is a great company with great future prospects. This will ultimately prove to be the bargain of the decade.
"I wonder when this ""will be in under $60 on its way to new low in the $40's"" is gonna happen as was predicted by the UnFortunate Teller (Paula). The $0.71 cash dividend didn't go away either. Really makes you wonder why someone who would want a stock to go up would keep posting false negatives about the company behind the stock...."
"Frost is an organization with nearly 50% of its assets in investment securities of very high credit quality. In the fourth quarter of last year, according to the last earnings conference call, management made the foresighted decision to purchase $500 million worth of thirty year US Treasury bonds at yields over 3.00%. As the market moves forward during this Coronavirus period, many banks will experience a contraction in their net interest margins, on the bottom end from the Fed having lowered short term rates to zero and at the other end from loan payment forebearance brought about by businesses that have essentially closed up because of the shutdown. Frost, having such a large percentage of its earning assets invested in securities as opposed to loans, will probably see significantly less interest margin shrinkage and may well emerge as one of the top earning banks of this time period. In that sense, CFR appears to be an extremely good buy at this price level, and it should very likely outperform it’s peers as actual earnings become widely recognized as exceptional."
Cullen/Frost Bankers reached an all time high at 127.66
CC was pretty good. This bank is in pretty good condition. At a loss to explain why it is down the last two days. Maybe folks are just distracted by big gains by the big 4 tech? I dunno
"Well, the dividend is still nice.I wonder how Mr. Evans, the previous CEO, is doing. He was a great leader. Many employees miss him."
"CFR continues to get the bad rap as being “asset sensitive.” As long as that thinking holds, the stock will be languishing despite continued strong earnings releases. At some point Wall Street needs to look at the earnings results and base their 12 month projections on something solid rather than just conjecture. If CFR were truly so asset sensitive that a down tick in rates would play havoc with their income statement, don’t you think management would be aware of that exposure and take measures to offset that risk? This management team has consistently avoided “betting the bank” on any one interest rate scenario. And, as far as the current CEO is concerned, who do you think was the architect of the tremendous interest rate swap that netted the bank over $1 million in income PER WEEK for years by having transferred to fixed rate a substantial portion of their floating rate loan portfolio just when the Fed was on the verge of taking rates to basically zero? No, this company is quite solid. If you’re in it for the long term just sit tight."
"Cullen Frost Bank processes 10,640 small business loans vs BOA processed 1000 total. Employees at Frost volunteering to work to get the loans processed. Regional banks, mid size, and small size businesses stepping up to assist not just the economy but their neighbors. It shows what regular everyday Americans can do. A crisis definitely brings out the best in the best. THANKS."
Paula! Calling Paula! CFR at 94! Your tome has come! Hurry!
Paula! Are you out yet?
"Gee, $83.24 today. Long cry from $60, eh Paula? Hope you are using this opportunity to lighten up or exit altogether."
and yet another up +6% up day.....when does it end......80? 90? 100? 115? 120? And a $0.71 dividend! Most banks have cut their dividend but not CFR.
hmmmmm who was right?
San Antonio media is reporting 68 officers and employees were recently laid off.Frost claims they are the first layoffs since 2002. They closed four branches and laid off over 40 officers and employees in their southern region just three years ago. It is very disappointing that current leadership would resort to such tactics.
"SO CLOSE yet SO FAR.........come on and get me out! Sold some earlier this week but not too much, just a little less exposure. I need $92-$94 on or about Thanksgiving.....get even, get the dividend, get out of CFR."
Typical CFR Bizarre price action..........why down after they announce to buy back all outstanding Preferred shares at $25/share. Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't that usually mean the stock price should go up since removing these shares makes remaining shares are more valuable (less diluted). What am I missing?
"A prudent investment practice is to buy stock in companies that (a) are in industries that you think have a good financial future (b) are well positioned in that arena, both geographically and financially, and (c) are run by a core management group in whom you can trust to do what’s best for the company and its shareholders. As long as your overall view of the market is positive and all of these three characteristics remain in place you hold the stock. If any of them change you remove the stock from your portfolio. You don’t ever just hang on because you can’t stomach turning a paper loss into a real loss, for that is, by definition “hoping” not investing. Sell out, take your money and move on to something else. You save yourself a lot of heartburn that way. CFR, to me, meets all of the requisites for continuing to hold. The outlook for banking is fairly good, they are well position within the industry, and their senior management is both technically superb and of a high moral character. I continue to own CFR because I believe their long term future prospects to be very bright."
Starnge that AH price on Yahoo has not updated since 4:30......also my trade platform showed a 15% ($12 increase) in AH. There most of the night then later showed flat in AH.Did anyone else see something like this in AH?
