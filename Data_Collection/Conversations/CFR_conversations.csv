"OK, here we go back to normal significant drops of 5% for a Texas Local Bank. Pure garbage, Willing to take a loss but I cannot even get a decent out point. Worse stock ever, like a cancer on my portfolio."
Crickets....
CFR is up 5.11% to 100.74
CFR is down 4.94% to 75.32
Starnge that AH price on Yahoo has not updated since 4:30......also my trade platform showed a 15% ($12 increase) in AH. There most of the night then later showed flat in AH.Did anyone else see something like this in AH?
CFR is up 8.67% to 61.42
"This stock is down 20% over the last six months. Supposedly CFR was going to engage in some buy-backs; well, this would be the time! I really thought we'd hit new lows in the low 90s, but now we're trending into the low 80s. Is there no bottom here?"
"I wonder when this ""will be in under $60 on its way to new low in the $40's"" is gonna happen as was predicted by the UnFortunate Teller (Paula). The $0.71 cash dividend didn't go away either. Really makes you wonder why someone who would want a stock to go up would keep posting false negatives about the company behind the stock...."
CFR is down almost 20% in a month and a half. From a high of 125 in May down to 105 and change in early July. What the hell????
"Their previous CEO was a better leader, IMHO."
CFR is up 8.86% to 58.10
"How does CFR announce fairly strong earnings, beat estimates by about 4 cents a share, and drop 3%?"
"CFR up 57% since March 23rd. Still a long way to climb back to pre-corona levels, but it’s a good start."
"Everyday markets make a new high, we are at record levels............yet CFR is down everyday. Probably the only stock negative for 2020. What GARBAGE!"
zzzzzzz.......zzzzzzzzz.......zzzzzzz.......zzzzzzzz
CFR is down 9.20% to 51.44
In light of the BB&T and Sun bank merger it is time for CFR to step up its game either buying or be bought. IMHO USB would be an excellent fit if CFR can not find anyone to buy..
CFR is up 8.41% to 53.36
Cullen/Frost Bankers reached a 52 Week high at 102.93
CFR reached a 52 Week low at 80.66
"no exposure to China, no rate cuts today, maybe Septrember and CFR is down. Just pure garbage."
"Gee, $83.24 today. Long cry from $60, eh Paula? Hope you are using this opportunity to lighten up or exit altogether."
"Fed rate cut in July is going to kill CFR, which is already depressed and cannot get over $93. CFR will be in the $80's very soon. CFR needs to be bought, mgmt is doing nothing for investors, Houston expansion we too aggressive and costly."
"My TD account is showing Trade Halted on CFR but seems to be wrong, looks to be trading....anyone else see this on their trade services?"
CFR reached a 52 Week low at 75.87
"and another miss for CFR, such a dog stock. PLEASE somebody swoop in and buy this dog, only way to save investors. DISMAL!"
"CFR continues to get the bad rap as being “asset sensitive.” As long as that thinking holds, the stock will be languishing despite continued strong earnings releases. At some point Wall Street needs to look at the earnings results and base their 12 month projections on something solid rather than just conjecture. If CFR were truly so asset sensitive that a down tick in rates would play havoc with their income statement, don’t you think management would be aware of that exposure and take measures to offset that risk? This management team has consistently avoided “betting the bank” on any one interest rate scenario. And, as far as the current CEO is concerned, who do you think was the architect of the tremendous interest rate swap that netted the bank over $1 million in income PER WEEK for years by having transferred to fixed rate a substantial portion of their floating rate loan portfolio just when the Fed was on the verge of taking rates to basically zero? No, this company is quite solid. If you’re in it for the long term just sit tight."
"Garbage Stock + Garbage Management = Garbage Stock PriceDown and Down every day......someone needs to buy this bank, fire everyone at the top and start making money for investors."
"Ok, I’m buying in again at these prices. Mid $68’s Or lower - looking to make some quick cash."
"CFR needs to be bought out by someone, like Suntrust was bought.......only way CFR stops being a loser."
Jerry Salinas did a great job on the conference call.He is very articulate.
Cullen/Frost Bankers is up 8.13% to 58.52
"Most banks reaching new highs, CFR down again. Even the Fed news can't get CFR moving up....only knows one way and that is Down!"
"a fantastic day for the market, a positive week possible, oil rebounding today, states and localities opening up, Texas plan to re-open working well, virus seems to be fading out, many many potential serums and vaccines being tested................and OH YEA, CFR Bank still a garbage stock and in a stand still with ZERO comments from Mgmt."
AIIB.....Tick tock !
"Takeaways from conference call on 3Q:2020 earnings: good solid organic growth in both loans and deposits. Energy loans continue to run off and now constitute 9% of the portfolio vs. 15% not that long ago. Duration of new securities is shorter than in previous years. Management taking a 10% pay cut and also cutting back bonuses for execs. Incentive accruals down for 2020 in light of earnings projections vs budget. Problem loans down. Houston expansion coming steadily online and contributing significantly to organic growth. In summary, this is what sound management looks like."
"This investment of mine makes no sense. Texas as a state is booming, low unemployment, attracting business, rated #1 state to do business on CNBC. CFR earnings report was up on all metrics, held guidance for the year. Yet stock price is trapped in this tight trade range....$111--$114. Everytime we get close to $115, stalls and drops back down. Why we can't breakout to the get back to the highs from prior to quarter results, $118.75 is beyond me. Any serious thoughts out there to help me make sense. Dead Money, Day Traders holding price down, or there is something fundamental I am missing.Thanks"
San Antonio media is reporting 68 officers and employees were recently laid off.Frost claims they are the first layoffs since 2002. They closed four branches and laid off over 40 officers and employees in their southern region just three years ago. It is very disappointing that current leadership would resort to such tactics.
CFR is down 10.61% to 61.52
POS.........enough said. SELL this Bank to someone who knows how to respond to investors and has mgmt who is vocal/calming/communicative.
This is very strange. Down over 20% and not a peep
"Worse stock ever! Soon this will be in under $60 on its way to new low in the $40's. Expect dividend to be gone after this ER.What is management doing/saying, no response to multiple calls to IR dept........someone buy out this dog please."
"FYI, if anyone is out there............CFR president will be on CNBC in a few minutes to talk about oil and impacts to their bank.Uh Oh...........they been silent all this time.......hope they have something positive to say."
Typical CFR Bizarre price action..........why down after they announce to buy back all outstanding Preferred shares at $25/share. Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't that usually mean the stock price should go up since removing these shares makes remaining shares are more valuable (less diluted). What am I missing?
Ain't no one saying anything about how the market is down 3.43% while CFR is green today...
Cullen/Frost Bankers reached a 52 Week low at 75.87
Here’s a piece written about some folks who actually know something about banking vs. people who just want to tear down CFR because their investment timing was less than “perfect.” https://www.forbes.com/worlds-best-banks/#600abeec1295
CFR reached a 52 Week low at $84.17
"Well no, Paula. CFR President was not on CNBC, the CEO and Board Chairman was. He also was on to talk about the PPP loan program and not oil. Then again you tend to ignore most facts about Frost in order to try and make the company look bad."
and yet another down 5% down day.........when does it end........bankruptcy? Most banks down 30% but not CFR they are down 50%. There is no justification for this to keep dropping without a single word to investors from the muted management.
CFR is down 9.06% to 52.40
Cullen/Frost Bankers is down 5.03% to 71.11
"Earnings of $1.50 per share for 3Q vs expectations of $1.19. @Paula, that sure sounds like lousy management, doesn’t it?"
Surprise Beat on Earnings......aaaaannnnnnd wait for it...........SURPRISE DOWN OVER 3%.!!!!!!!
CFR reached a new All Time High at 115.86
"Thought I would just stop by to reiterate CFR is a ""garbage company with bad management"" at the helm. This can't even get over the $100 mark, SAD!"
Cullen/Frost Bankers is down 6.88% to 56.97
"Just thought I would stop by to say..........""WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE""...........as I watch the market reach pre-covid levels."
Bearish descending triangle pattern forming?
"why did MS downgrade CFR today, what report or basis. Stock just started to move up and now drops back and most likely under $100."

"Frost is an organization with nearly 50% of its assets in investment securities of very high credit quality. In the fourth quarter of last year, according to the last earnings conference call, management made the foresighted decision to purchase $500 million worth of thirty year US Treasury bonds at yields over 3.00%. As the market moves forward during this Coronavirus period, many banks will experience a contraction in their net interest margins, on the bottom end from the Fed having lowered short term rates to zero and at the other end from loan payment forebearance brought about by businesses that have essentially closed up because of the shutdown. Frost, having such a large percentage of its earning assets invested in securities as opposed to loans, will probably see significantly less interest margin shrinkage and may well emerge as one of the top earning banks of this time period. In that sense, CFR appears to be an extremely good buy at this price level, and it should very likely outperform it’s peers as actual earnings become widely recognized as exceptional."

are you all still feeling positive and defend the incompetents running this bank. Silence is deafening!
"Paula, do you even read reports or listen to conference calls? I’ll point out just one of your many misleading statements. You say Frost sucks because its loan book is geared toward energy markets. Did you realize they significantly cut energy market exposure over a year ago? If Frost was doomed due to energy exposure, it would have gone under over a year ago."
"Significant volume Friday, near 5x average volume. Good sign or bad sign? I see no news or change in fundamentals except the chart trending to lower highs over the past weeks."

Frost is a great company with great future prospects. This will ultimately prove to be the bargain of the decade.
"Cullen Frost Bank processes 10,640 small business loans vs BOA processed 1000 total. Employees at Frost volunteering to work to get the loans processed. Regional banks, mid size, and small size businesses stepping up to assist not just the economy but their neighbors. It shows what regular everyday Americans can do. A crisis definitely brings out the best in the best. THANKS."
Would somebody please buy this bank!
CFR is down 5.02% to 70.74
Maxine Waters out final nail in bank stock coffin.....Heading back to $91....seems I am posting to myself.
"another day in the CFR toilet and another $2100 loss............at $82 we are at the lows seen in April and December drop. In fact this DOG breaks $80 will be a 3 year low and in fact heading to 5 year low.Where are the buy backs, where is management, what the heck are they thinking?"
CFR reached a new All Time High at 112.35
Cullen/Frost Bankers is down 15.86% to 52.38
I am disgusted with CFR not able to hold $100 let alone $105 which it teased a week ago. Any up tick to $105 I am taking my little profits and get out. Tired of dead money lying at rest in CFR.
and yet another up +6% up day.....when does it end......80? 90? 100? 115? 120? And a $0.71 dividend! Most banks have cut their dividend but not CFR.
CFR is down 4.96% to 90.23
"What the heck does a Texas Bank have to do with China or Virus? Seems like CFR wants to participate ONLY when the market drops, NEVER when market hits all time highs."
a lot of insider dumping lately
CFR is down 6.88% to 56.97
CFR just dropped below 200 day moving average....25% higher volume then average...big .banks are all down......smaller/local banks should benefit..........I guess confidence in banking and CFR stock is gone.Dead forum.
"A prudent investment practice is to buy stock in companies that (a) are in industries that you think have a good financial future (b) are well positioned in that arena, both geographically and financially, and (c) are run by a core management group in whom you can trust to do what’s best for the company and its shareholders. As long as your overall view of the market is positive and all of these three characteristics remain in place you hold the stock. If any of them change you remove the stock from your portfolio. You don’t ever just hang on because you can’t stomach turning a paper loss into a real loss, for that is, by definition “hoping” not investing. Sell out, take your money and move on to something else. You save yourself a lot of heartburn that way. CFR, to me, meets all of the requisites for continuing to hold. The outlook for banking is fairly good, they are well position within the industry, and their senior management is both technically superb and of a high moral character. I continue to own CFR because I believe their long term future prospects to be very bright."
"CFR needs to bought out by another bank...........no hope with present management and their ""spend strategy"". Mid to Low $80's coming soon AGAIN!"
CFR reached a 52 Week low at 72.10

Cullen/Frost Bankers is down 4.94% to 75.32
"up more than 6%...why hasn't management come out to give themselves a pat on the back, they should spend 100% of their time talking about their stock price and less about caring for the communities they serve!Poster's Note: This is sarcasm."
Paula! Are you out yet?
"Well, the dividend is still nice.I wonder how Mr. Evans, the previous CEO, is doing. He was a great leader. Many employees miss him."
Cullen/Frost Bankers is down 6.11% to 63.77
"An overall market wipeout in the past two weeks led to the ""emergency"" rate cut by the FED. The rate cut is killing just about all bank stocks, CFR included, combined with the overall correction/volatility we're currently experiencing in the overall market. We are now in bear territory for this stock being down almost 30% off of its 6 month high. Think there's any bottom here???"
Message from the Unfortunate Teller: Sub $60 by EOW very possible.
