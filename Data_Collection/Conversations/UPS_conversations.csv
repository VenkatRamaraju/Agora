This drop is due to the new threat from the infrastructure bill only supporting USPS!
"typically when i've sold off in the past it's been a few weeks on either side of a market high. i see the market stagnating even with strong earnings. it's a real tug of war this time, fear vs greed. and then there is the unexpected. Who know how covid will play out. selling was a tough call. still is. i just think the market is priced for perfection. the yield on S&P 500 is the lowest its been in many years at a little over 1%. Most parts of the U.S. looks pretty good, -we got the vaccine. Other parts of the world still struggling. And new covid variants are more than likely. One may get past the vaccine defenses entirely. An older investor like me is gonna stay safe and stay on the sidelines for most part ..glta"
The max pain for tomorrow's option expiry is $200. Hope MMs bring the share price up tomorrow to that level... I will be happy with $195. Please!
By august 21st the stock should be up to 235 a share its all a waiting game //
Hahahaha
"This is an incredibly important article that explains how both management and the Teamsters need to view the future in a macro sense. It's how we compete against the less constrained moves of our competition that'll secure and increase jobs. More and more players are entering the field with cost effective strategies not to mention what FDX, WalMart, Amazon and some other box stores are eyeing. A non-combative approach to negotiations offering needed flexibility would seem in everyone's best interests since it is a 5-year contract. UPS remains the highest paid employees in the industry and will continue to be when this contract is settled. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teamsters-election-may-hold-cards-140324977.html ."
"Carol Tome is a smart lady... May 29, she buys $1 million of UPS stock (10100 @ $99.33). She made a gain of 40%. Hope we all benefitted as well."
Back to $200+ tomorrow.
Shorts on the hook for the divy soon. Might want to cover out before you have to pay the divy.
"Today's the day we'll be listening to UPS tell us about their strategic plans. Hopefully we'll learn specifics about: where they plan to expand their international footprint; leverage new technology to improve productivity such as driverless trucks, robots for deliveries, blockchain and digital currency; partnerships with new technology companies including equity options in return for help with R&D and giving their technology credibility in marketplace; new technology platforms and contracts with their suppliers to allow middle market customers to leverage UPS buying power and create new sales channels; investments in building out a best in class reverse logistics network of consolidation, reclamation and retail centers for returns and distressed goods; gameplay for leveraging 3PL's to fill excess capacity on backhaul lanes without jeopardizing margins on existing business; and how they plan to complete against FedEx when they bundle their parcel business with LTL since UPS sold off their LTL division. Let's hope that their strategic discussions aren't dominated by political correctness, wokeness, ESG, and making hiring and promotional decisions based upon the color of someone's skin or what type of genitalia they have."
OK Apples to ApplesUPS Return on Assets: 6.52 percent Return on Equity: 98.74 percentFDX Return on Assets: 6.36 percent Return on Equity: 24.64 percentBased on this one metric please elaborate why the competition seems to be viewed as the darling of Wall Street???The above information was gleaned from statistics from Yahoo finance for the two companies
what is this about company paying out 50% of earnings? where was that stated?
"Haven't been seeing as many Amazon packages on my car as last year, but average package volume is still way up on my route from last year. Just saying."
"Well, well, well, look who finally had a good day. A break out of the recent range above the 15 DMA on decent volume. Another dollar and we can hopefully put the earnings debacle behind us. While I don't want to be greedy, a follow through tomorrow would be nice even if it is only 50 cents. Don't know what drove it today. Some vague news about surging container rates? Nice, but that doesn't seem to be worth 3 bucks. I will take it, but still looking for real good news that will take this over $200.00."
Purchased two shares today. UPS is beginning to grow on me.
amazon offering free delivery in 6 cities. and if amazon volume has fallen some since the pandemic- one would expect that amazon would be able to handle more of their own volume. that is what i am thinking. i wonder how volume at ups is doing? is it holding up?
"I think a lot of you are wondering what happened in the last minutes of the regular session on Friday. You witnessed the manipulation which takes place everyday on Wall Street. The 160 quarterly calls expired at 3 pm. I don't know how many would have expired in the money at that strike, but after witnessing the drop throughout the day and then the huge tank in the last few minutes, the number of calls finishing in the money must have been significant. Many shares would have had to have been purchased and delivered in the next 3 days. The funds who sold the calls, and most likely naked calls, shorted UPS down throughout the session and then harder to get the big drop just before market close. Then UPS was up well over $1 a share after hours. Games and manipulation by the big hedge funds. It is a rigged game. I expect now that the quarterly options are done, we will see a nice rise in share price."
"When viewing the better/bigger controversy, one only needs to look at the pricing model airlines use. When demand is strong your seat costs more. And that’s how package pricing will work as well. Forget the loyalty thing. Shippers care about price and performance. When UPS needs more volume, we will adjust the pricing to fill the void. The key is to maintain the best performance…on time and as promised. The immediate need is to fill the gap for weekend deliveries and transport and the Teamsters need to see that as well. Competition demands it."
"So when they buyback shares is the primary purpose to increase shareholder value or is it to get additional shares to put in their pockets via stock options on merit pay and performance? If so that would have a net effect of really not doing anything beneficial to shareholders. I think alot of these tidbits put out for the benefit of the uneducated investor leads to hype (which is a good thing), but not with much substance to back it up. Who decides when to flick the switch on share purchases based on shares being undervalued? Whomever decides that wields significant power. Is it done by group decision of the CEO, or the board as a whole? It seems that another function that wield tremendous power to drive the price is the PR department which can gin up excitement for a stock by pushing positive news on a frequent and steady basis. Hopefully those people's efforts are not taken for granted."
"UPS infrastructure is bought and paid for. The union let UPS implement a new pay rate(last contract) for new drivers called 22.4 drivers. The drivers pay rate is at a much lower level then senior employees and they stay at the lower pay rate until a senior driver retires or new work transpires. Volume this peak will be high and if the new covid stain hits hard, watch the volume skyrocket again. Rumor has this stock going to 300. Just saying..."
"Interesting how FDX is back to being the darling of the market and many analysts and talking heads. There's been no mention of any volume issue with them even though our on-time performance has been better. It would appear part of that is due to our turning away parcels if we can't meet commitments. Ideally, we quickly clear the network from cyber Monday to accept the restricted volume. I wonder if FDX has had any such issues? But it just seems odd that we get all the negative publicity and FDX is the darling. They've been getting substantial analyst SP target increases while we remain in the shadows. Of course, we'll know a great deal when they report late this month but for the time being it's a bit irritating. Thoughts?"
i noticed the earnings estimate for 2022 is 11.78. that is higher than when i last checked.
$5B buyback ...implemented over time of course ...the old buyback allocation hadn't been used up yet. i expect the did that to support the share price. the stock seems reasonably valued in my opinion ..of course there are lots of companies that are over valued -so it's all relative ..
"Absolutely disappointing! To drop back under $200 is very discouraging !! Mean while Amazon pays no taxes, cuts deals with every UPS client and buy up all kinds of companies and aircraft. Rapidly eroding UPS volume!"
Need to jettison another underperforming business unit. Hint: Capital Corp.
Next stop $195
Big spike coming. Dow Jones going up while tech going down!
"Walmart announces Go Local next day and 2 day local delivery service. Also read an article a few months ago where Walmart expanded their driverless delivery testing to a second location. When UPS, FedEx, and USPS can't offer the speed and quality of service needed, at an economical price, then new competitors will emerge and the lower cost regional parcel carriers will expand their footprints. Have you seen the Domino's commercial where they are piloting driverless deliveries? Did you see Elon Musk announce he's going to develop a robot prototype that can perform basic tasks before end of next year? It's just a matter of time before many of the existing parcel delivery drivers will be replaced by new technologies and lower cost drivers.....which doesn't bode well for UPS and their relationship with the Teamsters down the road. The storm clouds are beginning to form on the horizon for UPS, the highest cost carrier in the industry that also has a union anchor around its neck."
Just let it run....close over $192.50
"anytime this idiot speaks, the stock tanks. You don't think FDX and HD are experiencing the same? It's called CEO etiquette. No need to state the obvious. Anytime this fool gets on TV, they are probably rolling their eyes.. GO BAKE SOME COOKIES GRANNY!"
What are people's thoughts on whether the Teamsters might be open to discussions on outsourcing same day delivery? We're going to be leaving a big hole in our service portfolio as others keep moving in that direction.
CEO ON CNBC NEXT WILL CLARIFY THE CALL AND STOCK WILL GO UP
112 year old company solid earnings and great management plus 3.29 percent dividend which has been increased yearly not a stock for the get rich quick dreamers
"Consensus EPS for 2021 is currently $10.95, and $11.56 for 2022. That represents growth of only a little over 5%, yet the PE is still nearly 18X which reflects a growth company. UPS is not a growth company, nor does it want to be according to the ""better, not bigger"" strategy adopted by the former CFO of Home Depot who is now functioning as the senior co-CFO at UPS instead of the CEO that she was hired to be. There was a reason why Home Depot passed over Tome when their CEO position opened up, and refused to promote her to be their next CEO even though she was a female and they would have received a lot of kudos from the liberal/marxist/progressive press for doing so. Home Depot knew Carol was a good conservative numbers person, but didn't have the strategic vision and leadership to be their CEO. With only 5% growth in earnings being projected for 2022, and not much more than that for top line revenue growth, UPS should be valued with a PE of only around 12X. Particularly when you factor in the risk associated with the next Teamster contract renegotiation which isn't that far away....and Tome and the new CFO are rookies that lack credibility when dealing with the Teamsters. Look for the Teamsters to be contentious this go around and push the rookies around, including a potential work stoppage that would be disastrous. When you evaluate the risk and reward of owning UPS stock at the current stock price, I think many will conclude there is a much higher downside than upside. FedEx is a much better buy at the current stock price."
"Looking ahead it appears analyst estimations have been dropping for Q1 and FY. Q1 expectations 60 days ago was an EPS of $1.59. We now stand at $1.42. Full year sales growth is projected to be 4.7% or so. The 23 analysts who follow us on Yahoo have one year target of $121.91. That would be nice given our current state of affairs with capital and pension spending, the FDX re-mix of express/ground, and the Amazon growth and unknown impact on us. I just hope the company sees a way to reward shareholders with a 5-7% dividend increase. We've been long time loyalists without a whole lot to show for it except a steady and growing dividend. A least keep that trend in place."
Ups working with Ai
"what i like about UPS, and why i continue to hold the stock -is pandemic you win, no pandemic you win. either way the company will do just fine."
"Now that the pandemic windfall for UPS is winding down, we're beginning to see what UPS will really look like during the Tome era. Up to this point, she's been riding the coattails of David Abney's transformational initiatives and the windfall b2c growth that fell into their laps from the pandemic crisis. It was David Abney that spear headed the transformational initiatives that streamlined costs, significantly increased CapEx expenditures on expanding brick and mortar capacity as well as service center automation. It was under David Abney's watch that UPS made significant investments in healthcare, and decided to significant improve the mix of the higher margin SMB business. Tome's timing was perfect, but she'll be more exposed as Abney's initiatives wind down and the analysts and institutional investors begin to evaluate whether or not the new emperor has new clothes. Was it just me, or did everyone else want to puke when Tome uses the term ""leaning into"" during the call. Also when she signed off on protesting the new Georgia voting laws when she clearly didn't have a clue what they were. I think Tome was a good CFO at Home Depot, and will also be a good CFO at UPS. However, she'll likely be a terrible CEO just like Scott Davis was based upon no new strategies. She's just ""leaning into"" the strategic plan that David Abney laid out before he retired."
A close above $194.15 would be nice. A close above $195.19 would be better. I think we can do the former. I would be happily stunned if we could do the latter. It would be a sign we are pulling out of this rut.
"First some observations and then a question for those in the know. According to recent guests on finance programs, the labor shortage is becoming a big issue. We know that labor costs account for 65% of big company expenses. We know that companies like UPS, FDX, USPS, Amazon, Target and WalMart are among the many competing for a similar pool of employees. UPS has had a tuition reimbursement program for quite some time and was among the first if not the first to do so. Yesterday, WalMart announced an expansion and upgrade of their tuition benefit. Granted, their's appears to be for 10 online institutions vs. ours that, if I recall, permits its use anywhere. Can anyone discuss the effectiveness of the UPS tuition reimbursement program as it relates to recruiting and retention? Is that program's attractiveness being overshadowed by the medical benefits? I'm just wondering how we're competing in that arena these days. Another brief observation. With the excessive competition for warehouse workers, I'm wondering whether the ""better, not bigger"" mantra might be a slowly developing story with incremental volume pursuit as staffing and facilities permit. I know certain analysts look at revenue only but margins and profitability with the ability to goose them as appropriate makes good sense to me. Thoughts? Here's the WalMart story. https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/business/walmart-college-tuition-benefit/index.html"
I backed up the truck. Thanks for the cheap shares.
"UPS sure isn’t sitting on their hands. Drones, build outs, simple rating systems , easing returns, insurance changes. Somebody was awakened. Please keep it going."
Raymond James lifts UPS price target from $120 to $135. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ups?mod=mw_latestnews
TIme to cover shorts.
UPS (UPS) is set to report Q2 earnings results early tomorrow morning at 6am ET with a call to follow at 8:30am ET. The current S&P CapitalIQ consensus is for EPS to grow 32% yr/yr to $2.81 while revenue is expected to grow 13% yr/yr to $23.17 bln.Labor shortages were a concern at FDX.
"i have to say i am a little nervous about the next earnings report, esp. after what happened to FDX. i am hoping the ups mgmt has a better outing than their analyst day - hopefully there were some lessons learned from that-"
Should I invest in this stock at this price or wait for a much more dip?
What u saw was a pt driver not wearing his uniform shirt. You will see all kinds of odd things like that now. Employees are difficult to hang on to so a lot more is tolerated than in my day. Some of the facial hair and tattoos are pretty weird. Not in my day but here to stay.
Honestly feel like this is a dip you buy. The announcement of $100 billion in revenue and the stock tanks 5 percent. Obviously some people aren't liking the announcement of their strategic plans but the CEO is very competent and I'm convinced she can turn this company into a $300 stock over time.
I bought UPS today. It's going to be an amazing quarter for them.
"I think the UPS planning, operations and employee team are due optimum kudos. As we all know, the UPS planning for peak season begins mid year. So that basic master plan gets amped up by the need to engage in actual vaccine distribution planning and readiness in December. Hopefully, we can still be as successful as hoped with the parcel segment. One wonders how many more hub and delivery employees it would have taken to optimize that part of the business. What have people heard about vaccine vs. package priority?"
"Does anyone think this will drop back into the $180 range? Looks like they might be planning to fill a gap there. And no, I’m not short. I’m hoping it goes back up."
"Wow, clearly nobody cares about the dividend."
Another nice dividend capture this week and poised to break above $200. Fall back after stellar earnings was a false narrative for big boys to pick up shares from week retail traders.
"What’s needed is a source to educate investors. Tome has it correct. Not all volume is good. We never made money in December even though package volume exploded. Once we blow out the hubs and package cars the system gets manual and expensive. Hubs are running full but not crazy full. Mistake we made in the past was taking everything anybody wanted to ship. The pandemic brought Christmas volume everyday. Again, bean counters like Tome and the current CFO are not good cheerleaders. They need a PR person in investor relations that can get the plan out and recognized. FedEx did the same thing when they dumped Amazon and look how that finally got discovered."
Has anyone ever noticed how filthy the Amazon trucks/vans are? First thing that pops into my head when I see one in my neighborhood. Amazon = dirty business.
"Looking for a climb to upper 160's before UPS reports. We know the 4th quarter will be great but it's already priced in. A huge beat above what is already expected would be great, but an unexpectedly big bump in guidance (And I am hoping they give some) would be the ticket to send the share price to new all time highs. I have faith the new CEO knows how to cater to the wall street crowd. I think if numbers are good, especially margins, she will put an explanation point on the numbers with an upbeat conference call. Fingers crossed, but I feel great about the quarter and I think Carol will play it perfectly. She will get this share price to where it rightfully should be, one quarter at a time. Let's go!!"
Good company. Love the model. Load up !!
"Some Amazon advantages: no legacy costs, no union, new airplanes, new facilities, limited benefits (if any) to employees, they've learned thru association with us logistics and how to distribute, their delivery vehicles are brand new, they are more than just a retail/delivery operation, they really don't need UPS or FDX for much longer. So, given all these factors, if it wasn't for FDX being anti-union except for their pilots and mechanics, a UPS/FDX merger would actually make to fight off the Amazon behemoth. Amazon is a $900B company while we sit at $85B. My fear is that once Amazon is firmly entrenched in their own delivery network, they have designs on poaching the volume of UPSD, FDX and USPS. Remember when we used to talk about the difficulty of entry in the parcel delivery business due to the wide moat? Well, that theory seems to be seems to be in the trash can of history. I'm suggesting that some kind of monopoly/anti-trust scenatio needs to present itself. Smaller trucking delivery firms will be decimated and those with pension obligations will be really hurting and their long-time emplyees and retirees will be at th mercy of the bail out fund. I sure hope the regulatory agencies see the truly damaging effects of what Bezos and Amazon is doing. BTW, the $2B+ E.U. settlemenet fine being paid to us would be extremely helpful about now,"
"I guess we have seen enough to put some perspective into the developing results. Smaller is not better and UPS Has gotten where it is because bigger is better and always has been. That attitude will get us in trouble - a company that is not growing is a company heading down hill. I went to work for UPS in 1955 when we were just going into common carriers and the B to B part and growing slowly but surely the business and we had done very well. That’s all changing now and are facing more and more varied competition that intend to take as much of our business as they can. Just this morning I read of another company investing in’ Parcel Ships’ - anyone want to guess what that will do to our volume by Air to and from the world? Hint, not bigger. Look at what is happening with the Dividends and that’s just the beginning. We need “ Bigger and Better “ and the desire and fortitude to make it happen not just waiting around for our business to shrink slowly and surely. What ever happened to our drive to make it happen. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."

"OK- now that most of the analyst target changes are in it might be a good time to review. A selected cabal of these professionals can't excise the negativity from their minds. As we know, Morgan Stanley's excuse for a transportation/logistics analyst still lists us at a sell with a $120 handle. Next up the ladder is Berenberg at $150. Robert Baird is $178, JP Morgan is $181 and BMO is $195. The $200+ group starts with Bernstein and Citigroup at $200. Next is Barclay's at $205 followed by Wells and Oppenheimer at $210. Raymond James likes us at $223 and Key Banc at $225. UBS projects $244, Loop Capital at $250, Deutsche $260 and topped by Credit Suisse at $261. Considering the quality and reputation of the significant and well regarded firms placing continually growing expectations on UPS thru their detailed analysis, who would be willing to follow the lead of Morgan Stanley? He's been showing nothing but disdain for the operating initiatives, methods for growing margins and his lack of respect for the management team well preceded the Carol Tome's move to CEO. One would think if he was concerned about the pension situation, the announcement of Tuesday should have brought him some level comfort. If he's concerned about Amazon becoming the all encompassing behemoth, that of course remains his right. I just wonder if he ever imagined us being on the doorstep of $200 as he still targets $120? But then what do we know? We're only retail investors, UPS employees and UPS retirees."
"Keep in mind…all large shippers have multiple options with a variety of shippers. They use UPS and FedEx and others. The little guys that don’t get the huge discounts, they have no loyalty other than performance. And that is UPS’s strong suit….and also much more profitable by the piece. Those small volume guys carry a much more fully allocated cost model. It takes a boatload of Amazon pieces to make any money."
Time to sell this high paying Teamster Dinosaur! Way too much competition going forward...
Easy for market manipulators to play this when only 1.6 million shares trade. Hopefully UPS is exercising some share buybacks over and above the ones they use to pay management as an incentive (which happens every year around this time).
I suffered a paper loss today.In other news I also had a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice...
UPS is going to mandate workers get the jab according to a Reuters article posted 8/24. That should do wonders for driving the share price down further. They quote in the article that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been granted full approval. My understanding is that they don't manufacture that vaccine version because it does not have the liability shield as the non-FDA approved one does. Does anyone really know the truth?
Bc stocks are rigged
"I'm starting to wonder if Amazon is starting to flirt with antitrust, anti-competition boundaries. First, their business models have been destroying local businesses and even some that use its own sales platform. Then it develops its own delivery business using the IC business model. Then it develops its own airline. Then it contructs its own ocean freight operation. Now they've announced an intent to deliver products on a next day basis. Finally, it has just now indicated its planning to devise its own freight operation. There are a lot of non-Amazon jobs at risk- jobs that pay a higher wage scale then Amazon offers. There's also a few other important considerations. What happens to the pension futures of retirees and present employees of the freight companies that Amazon puts out of business? How about the struggles of the Post Office who will be losing small package volume to Amazon as the last mile delivery that both FDX and UPS use the PO for may convert to Amazon as the landscape changes? I think these are serious issues that the SEC needs to look at."
"Walmart (WMT) announced the creation of a new line of business -- Walmart GoLocal -- that extends its expertise in delivering goods to customers to businesses of all sizes. Walmart GoLocal is built on the retailer's proven ability to execute delivery capabilities at scale with efficiency. In just three years, the retailer launched and scaled delivery and Express delivery for its customers on 160,000+ items from more than 3,000 stores, reaching nearly 70% of the U.S. population and growing using its existing delivery network, including drones, autonomous vehicles and market fulfillment centers."
"Just based on PE ratios vs FedEx, Ups should be trading at at least $172 a share right now. UPS holds every statistical advantage over Fed Ex. UPS should have even more added value to be priced in as it has more assets, more cash, way more growth and less debt. So. comparing UPS to FedEx. Less debt: 30b vs 36b +120% AdvantageMore cash: 9.2b vs 4.8b +191% AdvantageLarger dividend 2.86% vs 1.51% +189% AdvantageRev growth 13.04 vs -2.5 AdvantagePE: 28.07 vs 34.43 Advantage- Also UPS is expanding further with drone tech and deliveries, Amazon still does not have FAA approval to do so.- UPS is expanding into unit storage facilities taking on U-HAUL and Public Storage Facilities.- Owned by UPS, Ware2Go: On Demand Fufillment and Warehousing will eventually compete with Amazon.I believe UPS should hold a current value at 140% premium over FedEX or about $236 a share."
"Why does our government. continue to let AMAZON ruin. other businesses and put people out of work ruin people's life unbelievable, what is going on in this country. .How is this working out for you people who VOTED for JOE, do you now see how inflation is going on and the price of everything is going up leaps and bounds daily. THIS IS CALLED SOCIALISM. I GUARANTEE HE COULD NOT GET ELECTED TODAY , EVEN WITH IS CHEATING"
Thank you Lord for the Deep discount bought more at $191.00 SEE YOU ALL AT $210 PER SHARE
Volume drives share price. Currently institutions must be sitting on the sidelines. Volume is half the average rate traded per day. To get this thing moving there needs to be good news of one form or another.
fire Carol
"On today's UPS Alumni Webcast, Carol stated that there will be.... ""good news at the end of the year regarding dividends"""
"a stable dividend and a stable dividend policy is what investors in UPS want. 50% of profits? for real? income investors want to know what they are getting through good times and bad. UPS took pride in providing a stable dividend that did nt go down and was typically increaesed each year. Did Tome just mess with that? Not good. And from a CFO no less. Doesn't she realize this is not what UPS shareholders are looking for? I mean, with the stock price cratering and all. o boy"
Whats going on ? Down 8% !?!?!
United Parcel Service is down 5.89% to 197.50
"The average UPS target price by analysts is $176. We're already there. Meanwhile, the average FDX target is $330 due largely to their recent very solid earnings report. We provide our report at 6 am on the 27th. There's no reason to think that we don't break our all-time high and move towards $200 in the near future. Having 3X the # of outstanding shares as FDX causes the 2 companies share price to seem skewed but their forward P/E's are not far apart and well below the S&P's. Interesting times ahead."
"Investing and getting returns is what I ever wanted and i have finally found a good broker, contact Stephanie A. William on Facebook."
Green by end of day and up to $196 minimum
I see Red tomorrow.......... Glad I sold several days ago!
"It would be hard to imagine the stoic past UPS management team making the bold move to sell the underperforming UPS Freight division to focus on core higher margin business. Carol Tome looked at the business from an outsider's POV and sold her vision to the BOD. It's nice to see proactive steps. Now, if we can just get the EU to live up to the $2B fine they were assessed per the TNT case."
"So ""Retail sales and industrial production each slowed more than expected in the world's second-largest economy (China)in July(according to the propaganda media). Generally speaking this should help stem the trade imbalance and also enhance the capacity utilization in both directions with UPS aircraft. Usually there is excess lift from the U.S. to China but lack of capacity feeding the U.S. from China. If this is true the balance of trade would lead to balanced flights to and from. The end result is UPS has more manageable profitable flights overall. That is assuming this isn't just a temporary blip on the radar."
ups generating a lot of cash. looking for a dividend hike. and some stock buybacks ... that will help support the stock price. the dividend % is not as appealing as it could be ..
"Seems like we've uncovered our new Donald Broughton. Berenberg analyst William Howard just downgraded UPS from a hold to a sell as part of what he describes a pair trade with FDX. He moved FDX from a hold to a buy and his reasoning is interesting. Essentially he says UPS has been doing too good of a job in expanding margins to 10% thereby putting FDX's paltry 3.5% margin in an explosive position. He extrapolates that even a modest improvement in their margins will be a huge catalyst in revenue and EPS. Apparently nothing else in the macro universe needs to be considered. He projects this theory forward to 2021 P/E where he believes FDX will come in at about 18X while UPS he sees at 21X. These figures would represent about a 32% premium to UPS' 10 year P/E history and a 30% premium to FDX's. Here's some things to throw into the mix. YTD, FDX is up around 50% while UPS is up around 40%- a factor worth considering. UPS has a more solid last mile delivery agreement with the USPS thru our Sure Post operation. FDX started pulling away from that. Seemingly that would help us control costs and perhaps help us in the competition for air lift with the postal service. Howard's target for his FDX buy call is $280 or up around 25%. Meanwhile, his UPS sell call targets us at $130 or down nearly 20%. Finally, just for good measure, he lists DHL as a buy as well. Personally, I'm hoping that our new CEO Carol Tome and the management team can send this guy packing along with Broughton."
"Here' some data on Amazon and their taxes. As many of us know, Amazon paid ZERO in federal taxes in both 2017 and 2018. It was noted that an Amazon Prime member paid Amazon $119 for that service which was more than the behemoth paid the Federal government. Meanwhile, UPS was paying between 35 and 37% during those years. When the new tax regime was passed, the Federal tax rate for corporations became 21%. As a result, Amazon was ""hit"" with a federal tax of $16.2M on their $13.9B pre-tax income. The rate? 1.2%!!! Meanwhile, thru September of 2020, UPS will pay an effective Federal tax rate of around 23.6%. So, Amazon works with the dubious independent contractor van operation (can someone elaborate whether this is true and, if so, how profitable it is for these people?), tries to fight off unionization (who knows what might occur with pilots and plane maintenance crews if they continue to expand their plane fleet?) at various locations and buys up affiliated or competing services to squash competition. At some point in time, the government has to remember that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. How many have been destroyed first by WalMart and now by Amazon- not to mention the pandemic? The theory of antitrust laws to eliminate the possibility of business crushing monopolies seems to have fallen by the wayside in recent years. It's well beyond time to bring it back in the case of Amazon."
it will fall today and tomorrowpick these up day after tomorrow
The outlook appears to be good so not sure why the selloff. Really looks like a buying opportunity.
"Just to add one other observation and would be nice if Carol were listening. Investors hate the word slowdown. And she used it twice. During Cramer’s interview, she bragged about calling it a year ago. No need to share that with the investment world.That will panic a lot of investors.Call it a re-normalizing B to B and B to C. And leveling volume spikes is a good thing."
Could there be a potential split in the near (next 12mo.) future?
I want to explain more of my thoughts on how we can make bigger better as we have done for more than a hundred years. We have always had people that think “outside the box” looking for better ways to do things and it is always good to have them in all functions if possible. That’s where most ideas come from for growing the business and controlling our costs . Thinking outof the box includes finding related business that compliments the established parts and those that become extensions to our business including diversified business. We don’t need limits but should be open to anything that we can fit in that will assist our growth. Bigger is Better.Thanks for listening.
Is the dividend in danger of lowering ?
"I was just listening to a guest on CNBC. He was discussing the difficulty that companies in general have in being able to envision the economy going forward. The fits and starts of the vaccination programming and the variant strains of the virus cause uncertainty and make the issue of consumer spending, the linchpin of the economy, unpredictable at best. I think if we throw that factor in with the issue of Amazon becoming a larger share of our overall volume, it all becomes unsettling. We know the end result of the FDX/Amazon relationship and what might ours be? There was just a story about Carol and the board re-evaluating our steps forward- how to best position ourselves for an evolving future. I guess this is a long-winded way of saying that the dividend decision (although not what we've been used to by any stretch) could certainly be construed as financially responsible. Thoughts?"
"As we know, UPS has their earnings call before the market open on Wednesday. Carol Tome's 2nd event will cover some nice tailwind topics. She'll discuss the upcoming new surcharges and their impact on revenues and margins, the previous investment in facility capacity all set to pay-off, projected cost savings of the H/R outsourcing, the upcoming engagement in covid-19 vaccine delivery operations, the ongoing advantage of low fuel costs, the growing on-line related volume and the view that when b to b activity returns margins increase. Ironically, if we get a nice bump up on Wednesday, Amazon reports the following day. So if they also project a gang-buster peak season we get a 2nd positive spill over by default. FDX got a huge bump up without any Amazon effect at all. If we can come close to replicating their performance, we should at least get back up to our 52 week high and be knocking on the door to $180 and perhaps beyond. So we'll see how Carol does on her 2nd call. Should be very interesting."
"UPS has been delivering small packages since 1907, from the beginning......"
"Biggest problem UPS has now is the messenger. The financials are fantastic. Free cash flow is currently more in 6 months than any previous year. Abney did a great job setting the table. Tome and Newman are great bean counters and technicians. Unfortunately, not good on camera or doing interviews. The June investment conference was a disaster and so was her latest reporting. The message is great, the delivery not so good!"
"Someone explain....Low fuel cost, Contract settlement, Tax Break, Increase capacity plan, Higher shipping fees, surcharges, and we still tank?"
companies do stock buybacks for a # of reasons. A smart/good mgmt wouldn't buy back shares unless they felt it was undervalued. They may wait and see to do any buyback. They may not be in any rush.
UPS plans on dividend returns to shareholders and share buybacks. Hopefully either yesterday afternoon or this morning they have begun with the buybacks. Anytime the shares are driven down like that it is a golden opportunity. I wonder who decides to pull the trigger when there is a buyback.
All I know is every Amazon package I see delivered around me is derived by either UPS or the USPS they need to start squeezing Amazon before they get big enough not to need UPS!
"""UPS is running one of the most successful peak season holiday shipping seasons ever,"" saysa UPS CEO Carol Tome. UPS is #1 in on time deliveries according to ship matrix. When one reads and absorbs this, it's curious that the market seems to elevate FDX to a higher status. FDX will report next week. Hopefully, they issue a solid report and we ride the coattails a bit. When our comes out in late January, we'll get a true reading on how the crux of peak season went. In the interim all we can do is hope for mild weather and congratulate the UPS team for a sterling effort at all levels. Here's the link to the press release. https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&id=1607429362225-691"
Drop in both Fed Ex and UPS AH. I see no news. Any insights?
UPS will benefit with investors jumping from Fedex to UPS because UPS is much more well run and profits are going to continue to fly higher.
PROFIT TAKING BEGINS = HEADING TO THE SIDELINES= TRADING THESE PROFITS.. FOR OVER PRICED REAL ESTATE EQUITY AND SECOND HOMES . you made money.. now go exchange it for life style
"To no one's surprise, UPS beats on revenue and comes up short on EPS. They were hurt by international volume and margin contraction among other things. They will suspend share buybacks (causing further pressure on EPS) and cut back on capital spending by $1B. I'm surprised that they've taken a pre-market hit of 4% but think that will be cut in half or even better by end of day."
If it isn't in the contract good luck trying to jam it down people's throats
"covid making a comeback and UPS rallying. I would think the two are related, but should they be at this point? The first covid surge resulted in a big shift to the internet for purchases. Some of that volume has stayed. i doubt we will get a second volume surge. There is a lot of traffic on roads now, and i look and see that the mall where i am is very busy. Glad to see UPS serving as a hedge though as the market takes a hit."
"Amazon is gonna find out real quick how much it costs to deliver to rural America. They may have the density to break even in the city and suburbs but when they take the good density away from UPS or usps guess what, rural rates don't get discounts. Good luck short sited Amazon"
"ups will detail more of their ""transformation"" plans tomorrow. expect hey will focus on more cost reductions by trying to get rid of senior employees - not age descriminiation, they wouldn't do that right? -they value years of service and dedication lol ... good for stockholders though -the stock may get another bump up. expect a very positive mtg from upper mgmt - they must be happy with their stock options.."
"Since the CC I've been searching through financial websites looking for Tome's ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" terminology in any financial spread sheet, I have yet to find it. Anyone on this board know what the outsider is trying to say..in simple English?God Bless us all,Michael"
"You can't honesty believe Amazon can roll out an entire shipping company with the logistical capabilities of UPS? Even Amazon has said multiple times, they can't replicate the scale or infrastructure of UPS or FDX. People don't get it- delivering packages the last mile is only a very small part of the logistical chain."
I've been getting Walmart deliveries via FDX ground. I had always thought that Walmart was not a particularly good customer for a shipper due to their negotiating low margins. We all know FDX walked away from Amazon for that reason and for self preservation. So my question is how is FDX generating the profit margin it needs on these Walmart deliveries? Any folks in sales have any comment on this?
my biggest concern is going forward........here in metro detroit we can't find help...............we have 12 p/t and f/t supervisors in our 200 car building doing hourly work for over the past year.............what happens in september when we bring the employees all back and have to pay them...................i'm just wondering if it is this way throughout the entire country...............scale back tax breaks and raising corporate taxes it doesn't seem bright................i read somewhere the whisper # is 3.11..............................that just seems to be awfully ambitious to me...........hopefully i'm wrong.................go brown
"Sorry, but dividend is a HUGE disappointment. $1.02 with the stock price what it is and the year UPS had? it rose .05 cents from 2019 to 2020. Would love to hear the reasoning for only a cent this year. Certainly won't make it any more appealing to new investors."
UPS has been in business since 1907 they did good before Amazon was ever around and they will do good with or without them as they are a very well run company with a dedicated management team.
"Coming positive earnings surprise on the 27th. Can't get much better. By holding the dividend payout rate to a manageable amount it allows for more latitude in operations. Add to that the previous heavy capital expenditures the past few years also allows for significant return to the bottom line. Looking back CAPEX ramp up was one of the smartest things they ever did, even though at the time the skeptics disapproved. The centers are like peak every day. Hiring many, many new folks signifying tremendous growth. All business units are firing on all cylinders."
So it beat expectations but stock is down in pre-market??
"This is your last chance to cover below $192 This is what they shorted yesterday?Market Date Short Volume2021-07-27 2,490,291"
Little confused about Carol's announcement on a new dividend payout target of 50% of earnings and how they will implement.
"UPS is a company that will benefit greatly from automation. Companies nowadays have fewer workers due to automation. For UPS there is so much room for improved margins due to automation. Driverless cars. Auto-loading of their delivery trucks. It's coming. Driverless cars will not take much retooling. Hub automation is a different story. Regardless, automation goes in the plus column big time. Unfortunately another strong union will lose all its bargaining power. And that will be the end of it. I am a shareholder, so i see glass half full."
Its called a pump
Amazon made a wise move in buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets from Delta and Westair and what I'm sure was a hefty discount due to those companies being in financial strife. I hope we are thinking along the same lines. One thing I'm interested in seeing is the claims expense that will arise from the big 4 shippers as a result of damage and theft during Q4. Particularly Amazon and USPS had mis-deliveries galore and the volume crush that we all experienced must have led to higher than normal damages in processing. Add to that the influx of companies utilizing on-line shipping vs in store sales and the lack of the skill set to package properly and claims automatically rise.
"hard not to be optimistic about the quarter......not expecting a huge beat but expect every aspect of business running above expectations.....capital expenditure was heavy in 4th quarter as Tome said it would be but a 2.5 billion reduction next year, a weaker dollar,voluntary separation program, elimination of UPS freight, B2B resumption this next quarter, amazon to make prime 1 day service will be huge for UPS ,$1400 stimulus, extra surcharge for doing business, 2 billion lawsuit settlement. and i suspect a resumption of stock buybacks are huge tailwinds for UPS.....just beginning phase 2 of UPS transformation....as a long term moneymaker and huge growth potential its hard not to ;love the business we are in"
"Biggest problem with UPS today is the market manipulators pulling the strings. When a single institutional holder or two control a good percentage of shares the tail is basically wagging the dog. It really doesn't matter how good or bad earnings are, but it is all about timing of their agenda and when THEY feel like playing the stock up or down. Control and power are all they really care about because it gives them the house winning edge in the market casino."
Kinda wierd yhat fedx and ups fall the same day and no recover. Kinda wierd.
"OK- so what do folks think? The Pfizer vaccine news which may soon be followed by Johnson and Johnson and Moderna perhaps among others, will surely have an impact on the business outlook. The companies that have been benefiting from the stay at home economy are being hit a bit this morning- UPS and FDX among them. What that seems to ignore is that the profit margins are significantly higher b2b vs b2c. So that shift ultimately will work in our favor. In the interim, we still have the high volume, high revenue, higher profits scenario at work. The issue of course has been the margins which in theory will start moving in a better direction with the return of b2b. Thoughts?"
"Raymond James just upped their UPS share target from $165 to $195 while maintaining their strong buy rating. So the last 4 analyst moves have been 9/21- $192, 9/23- $183, 9/28- $193 and today's $195."
UPS has averaged 7.9% dividend increase over the last decade. I predict a 7.3% move upward to be announced this month to make it $4.12.
"A.P. Moller-Maersk, the parent of container shipping giant Maersk Line, just spent nearly $1 billion to add two logistics companies that will bring the ocean carrier PARCEL-delivery capabilities. Maersk CEO Soren Skou tells the WSJ Logistics Report that with $11.5 billion in free cash flow in a surging shipping market, the operator has “quite a substantial war chest” and may even complete more acquisitions this year. Maersk’s capacity strategy right now is focused on land, as it looks to build up more stable business with big enterprise customers under long-term contracts.When the U.S. Post Office and UPS refuse to invest capital to expand capacity to match the growth in eCommerce growth, there will be other players step up and invest the capital needed to address the market demand. Amazon was forced to spend tens of billions of dollars to create their own asset based logistic's network when UPS, USPS, and FedEx were unable to provide them the capacity and service quality they needed. Walmart is starting to follow suit. The regional parcel carriers are growing so fast that at least one of them has refused to accept any more customers until next year after they expand capacity. Yet good ole UPS says better not bigger is their strategy, and only wants to invest around 4% of revenue in capital despite competing in the global logistics marketplace where eCommerce is growing in the 10%+ range around the world. This is opening the door for more competitors to enter the market, and regional parcel carriers to significantly invest more capital to expand their footprints. UPS has decided to adopt a strategy of price gouging their customers and milking their assets to increase margins and cash flows......but will one day wake up to discover they're the next TWA, Kodak, Eastern Airlines, Bethlehem Steel, or perhaps the U.S. Post Office losing billions of dollars a year with their extremely high cost, unionized business model."
"UPS is losing money on Amazon they are providing excellent service for a far to low rate. The drivers are running for single stop deliveries not making a dime on a system design to make money on bulk pick ups and deliveries mean while Amazon looks like Stars and slowly increases there distribution capabilities on UPS's dime. They definitely need to upgrade there facilities, however need to rethink ecommerce strategy?Just saying???? Every year it's the same line.....next year will be a good one!"
"Seems the peak season package surcharge for selected shippers program is exactly right. It covers the time period from mid-November thru mid-January (returns revenue will be goosed). It only applies to those shippers with volumes of 25K a week or more (gotcha Amazon- deal with it). Since it's a seasonal thing, it shouldn't have a long-term impact on on-line shipping but rather allows us to cost effectively manage our way thru peak season. Another of the inspiring events since Carol Tome was announced as CEO. It seems like all the news and every move we've made since she became CEO (from a long the BOD experience) board) has been dramatically impactful and forward thinking. We are lucky to have uncovered a gem. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-plans-heavy-holiday-fees-225026622.html"
"Decent day, kinda fizzeled into the close with the rest of the market. Green is better than red. Volume has returned to normal. RSI still says oversold."
"UPS has really gapped down below a major support level (50 Day SMA). The next major support level is the 200 Day SMA, which could be around $185 per share. I would not buy until I see a candlestick reversal signal with confirmation."
i think there are earnings jitters across the board and i am looking forward to the actual earnings announcements by companies. i think they will be very solid for the most part. that should calm the markets.
"Only 6% EPS growth projected for 2022 vs 2021, and stock has a forward PE ratio of over 18x. FedEx EPS growth projected to grow 12% next year, yet forward PE ratio is only 12.6x. FDX's revenue growth is projected to grow faster than UPS. Only 7 of the 27 analysts who cover UPS have it as a Buy or Strong Buy. 22 of the 27 analysts covering FDX rank it as a Buy or Strong Buy. FDX just increased it's CapEx budget by 20% for this year as a result of stronger than expected volumes. UPS is not increasing their CapEx and has stated they don't want to be any bigger...just better. Which company deserves the 18x PE multiple? The company with the higher revenue and EPS growth that is investing more capital to expand capacity and improve automation, or the company with 1/2 as much growth? Hmmm"
"if you are going to be valued as a growth stock, then you have to justify the higher PE going forward. That is hard to do when the volume surge due to covid already took place last year. I was a bit scared of how this would go and with good reason. UPS has corrected and is more in line with forward expectations. I am concerned for overall market as well. Earnings look good now, but going forward there is inflationary pressure and higher labor costs due to worker shortages. The pandemic is coming back esp in the many countries with low vaccination rates. glta .. i held onto this stock. hoping for dividend raise. on the sidelines after selling vast majority of my other holdings. i beleive we've hit peak earnings. remember the markets trade on forward pe multiples. i.e. expectations of future growth...glta"
"a panic over inflation - what would one expect after a pandemic and interest rates near zero. we are a long way from equilibrium. with a strengthening economy, the markets will rise for some time -in fits and starts -as interest rates slowly rise. and fed is talking hikes in 2023. a 30 yr treasury paying 2% vs. UPS, which yields 2%, expected dividend hikes, and 16% projected annual growth over next 5 yrs. Let's see- which is the better value? UPS and a lot of stocks out there still a better value than treasuries. I won't let computer algos, hedge funds and day traders steal my money. It is too early to bail on this market."
"Once again, Amazon has done the ""giant squid"" routine on its competitors. After purchasing a number of aircraft during in recent times, Amazon has announced that it is transporting cargo for the postal service. That impacts both UPS and FDX as we were the primary recipients of that volume. One wonders what the pay scale of the pilots who are contracted by Amazon to fly that aircraft vs. the rate of pay/benefits of UPS and FDX pilots under their strong unions. It just appears that Amazon has no limits as to what segments of the logistics business it targets. UPS and FDX just need to diligently keep pace until via monopoly or anti-trust actions congress might decide to break up some of the big behemoths."
"I noticed something odd today (Saturday) and I wonder if others have as well. There was a young driver (a part-time driver or whatever the category is now) pulled on the side of a pretty busy street in a P600 or larger package car. He was carrying a pretty bulky package and had to cross the street so I stopped for his convenience. I must admit, I've been retired for very long and was not in operations so the terminology on package car size and driver classification probably is not accurate. But what is accurate is he was wearing UPS shorts but a white t-shirt. I've never seen that before. Have things changed that much? FDX, Amazon, and Post Office delivery people are readily identifiable. While I'm at it, have others noticed Amazon drivers scooting along on their routes with their van side door open? Is it makeshift air conditioning? I wonder about parcels inadvertently falling out. Of course, I wonder about a lot of things these days....."
"Wall street doesn't reward companies that say they don't want to grow much, which is the stated strategy of UPS under the new CEO who's really just a CFO, i.e. ""better, not bigger."" Why on earth would Tome say she's not going to invest much capital to expand capacity at the biggest logistics company in the world? 4% of revenue is all she wants to invest in CapEx while eCommerce continues to explode around the world. She just wants to price gouge UPS's customers while capacity is tight to focus on improving short term margins and profits. All she's doing is kicking the door wide open for DHL, FedEx, the regional parcel carriers, Amazon, Walmart, etc. to invest billions more to expand their footprints and capacity and build out their logistics networks. Everyone else wants to be bigger AND better, except for UPS who want's to hunker down, bury their heads in the sand, and milk their assets. My sources within UPS say there are literally dozens of CapEx projects with excellent NPV's and ROI's that never get approved, and it takes literally months to evaluate and approve a project. Very bureaucratic, stodgy, and conservative management team. Why on earth did UPS appoint Tome to be their CEO instead of a strategic leader from Google, Amazon, or Apple? Home Depot passed over Tome when they backfilled their CEO position, which should tell you something. Is UPS expanding their footprint in India and other 3rd world countries? Are they trying to have the best reverse logistics network in the industry? Do they have a last mile delivery solution for heavy goods? Do they have an eCommerce platform for their SMB customers to sell their goods to other SMB customers? Do they negotiate deals with their suppliers to enable their SMB customers to leverage UPS's buying power to buy their goods cheaper? Do they have an LTL solution like FDX, and why weren't they able to effectively manage their LTL solution like FDX has been able to do? Now that they dumped their failed LTL asset based solution, are they purchasing an asset lite LTL brokerage and integrating the technology with their UPS shipping solutions? Do they own a large network of warehouses that their SMB customers can leverage to streamline their distribution and reach new customers? Now we have to wait at least 5 more years for the next CEO to be appointed, who will hopefully be a strategic leader and innovator, and hope that the Teamsters don't roll over Tome and make her agree to onerous contract terms that make UPS non-competitive and significantly erode profit margins. On the bright side, UPS finally checked the box when it comes to appointing a minority CEO, and will be able to look for the best candidate next time rather than the one who has the politically correct genitals or skin color."
"Morgan Stanley's Recap of UPS Strategy Meeting:""2021 Analyst Day: Not Quite the Event We Were PromisedUPS’s Analyst Day was somewhat of a victory lap on recent gains but light on the details (and numbers) around guidance, cost savings, pricing strategy and competition that we and the market were looking for. In general, there were no real surprises and the content / message did not deviate much from past UPS analyst days despite the almost all-new management team. This may come as somewhat of a disappointment as the mgmt. team had indicated that everything was on the table and that no stone would be left unturned as partof the “Better not Bigger” strategy revamp. In addition, the content came across to us as slightly backward-looking, a (deserved) pat on the back for how much UPS has improved in the last 15 months – both aided by and despite the pandemic – but forward-looking detail was a little light.""The bloom is off the rose for Carol Tome, who has been on the UPS board of directors for many years. She rode the coattails of David Abney's Transformation initiatives and his heavy CapEx spending to increase capacity which was perfect timing for the pandemic B2C windfall. Carol confirmed what many of us suspected, i.e. she was a really good CFO at Home Depot, but doesn't have the strategic vision and leadership required to be a really good CEO. Which is why Home Depot didn't promote her to being their CEO when the position opened. UPS now has 2 really good CFO's, and we'll have to wait about 5 years to see if they can find a strong CEO."
Back up we go
i'm not sure why you would want any more volume.............every supervisor is doing hourly work now..........brought 13 new hires in for intro to company..............1 showed up...................be happy with share price but sooner or later we will have union employees to replace our supervisors working.....just saying
"I guess the ""smaller is better"" game plan of CEO Carol Tomé's also applies to the stock price."
Last chance to buy below $193
bank earnings were good and they are down. cyclicals are down. the cpi that cam out was very high but the 10-yr is down. markets are sending a signal. we've peaked. at least for awhile. meanwhile markets priced for perfection. i think the risk-reward at this juncture is not very favorable. so i'm mostly on sidelines now. there is something called reversion to the mean and we are due .
having second thoughts about this market. sold off most of my holdings this AM. the market behavior does not sit right with me. i held a lot of cyclicals and they lost momentum. 10yr treasury yield declining. not sure what is behind all this- delta variant worries? this market is at nosebleed highs. better safe on sidelines than sorry. ups appears to be in the sweet spot though. it wins delta variant impacts or not. so not a bad place to be. maybe that is why the momentum. people looking for safe haven stocks.
Want to know how the people that run the company are doing? Every year they raise the rates about 5 percent. To determine their success subtract that off of what they made for the year and that is what their true efforts accomplished. A simpler way is show a 5 percent growth line from 20 years ago and see how it coincides with the share price (compounded of course).
Order set at $189
"For some time, most of us have been lamenting the low profile and essentially boring and conservative quarterly earnings reports UPS had presented to analysts. Today, Carol Tome was so incredibly energetic, thorough in her answers to analyst queries and focused on the future that it was simply a pleasure to listen to. Even with a slightly close to the vest discussion of the next 2 quarters, her explanation of the UPS game plan was extremely well received. The discussion of not wasting $$ on buying excess aircraft even though they could be acquired at a bargain because money could be better invested elsewhere was a spot on example. Her repetitive reference to a lazor focus on doing what the customer wants vs. what we might think they want was perfect. She said she asked the management team why the improved time in transit goals would take so much time to be completed? When told it was the cost, she instructed that the $$ be spent and the goal reached by around October. Everything she and Brian discussed were so refreshing and dynamic. A great earnings call leading to a 15%+ upside."
Trading down and sideways for years to come..... kind of what has happened in the last 20 plus years!
my campbells soup shares are getting hit on earnings today ....mmm mmm...not so good ... another exciting holding of mine ... dealing with supply chain and marin issues from higher input costs ...it is getting tougher out there for companies ..
"It's interesting how selected analyst firms or people like Donald Broughton and Morgan Stanley maintain a negative view on UPS regardless of circumstances. After a blow out 2nd quarter and a sensational earnings call, Morgan Stanley for example designates UPS to underperform. Broughton will always be Broughton. Surprisingly, Credit Suisse lists UPS as neutral. By comparison, Raymond James has us as a strong buy with a 52 week target of $165. Deutsche comes in at $160, The Street is $163, CFRA is $157, and Stifel Nicolaus is $152. I guess for selected analysts, everything must be a fairy tale. Capital spending, even if designed for future excellence must be limited, the economic forecast domestically and globally must leave no doubts, the future of the Coronavirus impact on the world must be known, all future weather events must be known, all currency changes mus be known, the future of the USPS service levels must be known. In summary to satisfy the analytic st whims of a select few, there can be no uncertainty in a world filled of nothing but."
"Carol Tome, as the CFO of Home Depot was one of the best ever to explain things on their Conf. Calls. She can really slice and dice the numbers and i'm confident she will improve UPS operating results."
"Well the $200's where nice while they lasted! It sure was nice to think we turned the corner!, but I guess will have to hope Carol knows what's she's doing?"
Just bought before closing. Ready to add if its red tomorrow.Too oversold.This is easy money
A short step back. It will regain within 8 days
"So what's going on with UPS? Why is there such a big push to drive it below 190? This is certainly worth more than that, what am I missing? Dow closed over 35k yet UPS goes way down..."
"It tried to bounce today, but it the face of Amazon and a bad tape it held up okay. It was actually green for part of the afternoon. Still badly oversold. Next week is a new week."
Thank you for the discount
"An interesting analysis of Amazon delivery operations. As of May, Amazon was delivering 48% of its own volume. USPS was getting 33%, UPS 17% and FDX 2%. It seems to me that to date Amazon has dealt with the easy stuff. As they need more tractor trailer drivers, face IC turnover, try to live up to promises of next day delivery, deal with service delay issues and eventually face higher wages, the real difficulties begin. They're already facing issues with their contracted pilots. But hey, welcome to the real world Amazon. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guess-just-became-amazon-apos-100200155.html"
This is a fascinating company. For small companies (part of our target group) this presents what would appear to be a pretty nice option. Price wise they can't be beat and the convenience is unmatched. A company can request pick-up or drop it off at Post office. It's a 2-day service and purports to deliver nationwide. It has over 1 million customers in the U.S. after having proven its business model in Australia. This is yet another competitor UPS needs to be very aware of. Has anyone used this service or know someone who has? https://try.sendle.com/en-us/how-sendle-works
"Ok so Carol skewed up on call. That is Over and overdone. UPS is a cash cow with strong fundamentals in this sector. SP will rebound as smart money knows, they love to buy from weak hands on these type of dips."
the market is faltering ............................ugghhh............
"So what really changed from yesterday to today. Nothing other than smashing earnings estimates. The fear mongers did good and the market manipulators did their thing and drove this down on fear, shaking all the weak kneed. Things should be relatively almost back to normal soon minus the investors that were shaken out and feel dejected now. Onward and upward matey."
"If one spends some time looking at the metrics of UPS vs. FDX it surely appears that we hold the upper hand. We're very close on forward P/E and have a large lead in net income, free cash flow, profit margin and operating margin. Seemingly we're going to benefit more in Q4 on the Amazon overflow if we are able to control the quality of volume we will accept. The decision by Carol to not specifically discuss the aspects of the Q4 earnings expectations beyond simply generalities didn't please the analysts or the market in general. Nothing new there. For us retail holders, it is discouraging when we know that the company is extremely profitable even when dealing with less than desirable volume. We know that when the higher margin b-to-b volume comes back we'll hit lofty share price levels. In the interim, it just seemed like the mid-$160's would have been a reasonable level. Our forward P/E is within the average range for the transport industry and it's not like we're hurting like certain sectors are. It's all a bit befuddling and maybe it's just a function of the lack of a stimulus bill and the impending disruptive election. Regardless, I think we're all disappointed on how the share price continues to drop. We surely didn't get the FDX pop- in fact we suffered the opposite."
"Not much left for sale down here, funds will need to raise their bid to obtain more needed shares."
"The peak season options for lower rates keeps expanding. For the last few years, we squeezed our customer base in an effort to juice profits. Looks like we're facing a bit of pay back time. We should be looking at acquisitions and discussing all this with Teamster leadership. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lone-star-overnight-simplifies-peak-221500852.html"
"Maybe Carol is going ""better, not bigger"" because they see a depression on the horizon and it would be throwing money away. Maybe all of the movers and shakers in the CEO world have already been made aware of what the future holds by the cabal that really controls the global economy. Something to ponder...."
I bought ups at 103.7 then fell to 82 because of corona. It rose to 103 again yet It slumped 88 again because of april earning report. I could take it anymore thus i sold it at 107 but it jumped to 110 as soon as i sold it lol very very interesting. I wrote this message on monday but yahoo deleted as always...
does anyone have thoughts on 2Q ? i mean insightful thoughts? i am kind of nervous after fdx fiasco.
I could use more shares. Thought about it today and will wait to see on Monday.
this is why i went to the sidelines ...as stated in my previous posts ..i have an excellent track record ... it is not that hard...you just have to be able to read the tea leaves. the markets are smarter than any one of us. there were clear signs. i dont know if this is a correction or the start of a more prolonged market downturn.
There is some info thats going to happen in the spring of next year that will make ups fly to the 300s price range... But its not good to brake the news till it happens..
Gonna guess this is a buy the news event.
"Not funny, where is the bounce. Thank God I sold all my options close to the high today. Just bought a bunch more and waiting for the FN bounce again....I was looking for a much higher bounce. $194 and change is stupid. Where is the $4 to $6 bounce?"
"Trying to wrap my thoughts around an accounting question. If you don't raise the dividend doesn't that translate into the ""free cash flow"" area on the balance sheet? The money has to show up somewhere. Valid thoughts anyone??? On the earnings call I believe Carol touted the highest FCF in 6 months that normally would take a year. Isn't that just an accounting gimmick achieved by holding off on paying a dividend increase?"
"comparisons to last year's Q2 are tougher. that is when online shopping really took off due to the pandemic. of course, when the spike hit, it was a shock and carriers were not ready for it. this quarter's comparisons may be toughest of any quarter this year. so we just gotta grin and bear it ..."
"Why is that bad news for FedEx is always bad news for UPS? Also, good news for UPS always benefits FedEx more. Don't people realize by now they have 2 completely business models. 1 UPS driver delivers what FedEx has delivers by 3 drivers. FedEx margins for air services are very thin, UPS margins huge."
Hey longs: You seeing UPS in the DEEP RED today?
interesting article on teamsters upcoming election. it mentions tome's plans to have micro fulfillment centers for same day delivery. the article mentions that will be an issue with the teamsters. that is unfortunate because it won't be an issue with competitors. upd having to higher teamsters at much higher cost for these centers would not be competitive. things may come to a head sooner than i was thinking.
"UPS stock price bounced alright, but just not forward. I am getting out."
Dated back when UPS went IPO in 11/1999 its workers were so gung-ho that most planned to buy vacation home thinking that they will be multi-millionaire in a heart beat.Fast forward. 20+ years later. UPS just a growth stock and not much else.I use about 1 or 2 stamps each year.
"if you read harvard business review, Tome's resume fit the bill for what they are looking to accomplish while the other execs gain more experience. apparently, they were not ready to fill the ceo chair. the person that was slated for the job was jim barber, and he unexpectedly retired."
"I think price action today more of a macro commentary. We have topped out on peak earnings and there are some clear inflationary headwinds coming. This is a terrific company and a terrific stock but it ran a bit too far so it is re-setting. I don't want a cheerleader for CEO. I want one to tell me what he or she is worried about and how they are positioning. Thats what this one does. If you were trading UPS, you may have gotten hurt here. Larger issue to me at least is S&P at 4400 and Dow at 35 k. Thinking of shorting SPY into second half."
"I retired from UPS after nearly 38 years and the majority of those years I was in management. I still have approximately 40% of my investment wealth wrapped up in UPS. the main reason is the stable dividend, certainly not the growth potential of the stock price. If you look back to when UPS went public the stock is only up around $20 a share. A $4.00 a share reliable dividend however is hard to come by. I have no expectations of a dividend increase in 2021 but that's ok as long as it's not cut which I seriously doubt it will be."
Time for a new CEO !
"90% of my deliveries are via UPS. During the last 15 years with hundreds of deliveries I have yet to experience a lost or damaged package. I say this because it is usually the one person with one poor experience that blabs it all over, not the people that have great experiences all the time. UPS is also the only company that tells the truth. Fredex does not tell you they have limited volume from some shippers but its true. Keep running up that FDX stock. its gonna fall faster than it climbed."
#$%$ again a record close above 35k and were still going nowhere from the 2nd qtr. report! Total BS!
"United Parcel Service, Inc. $UPS Total Debt (mrq) $26.81BBook Value Per Share (mrq) $8.22"
"WSJ Article Stated: ""The surge in digital commerce-driven package demand is fueling growth beyond the big national parcel carriers. Regional operators including Lone Star Overnight and LaserShip have been expanding well beyond their traditional markets, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, as they look to capitalize while retailers look for fast, cheaper options to deliver packages to customers’ homes. Their expansion comes as an array of delivery, logistics and technology businesses are finding room to grow as alternatives to the sector heavyweights Amazon, FedEx and United Parcel Service. LSO expects its e-commerce business to nearly triple this year. LaserShip’s demand is so strong it has already stopped taking new customers until January. They’re getting a boost from the surcharges the big parcel carriers have imposed as their networks fill up. Even with their rapid growth, the regional carriers still make up a relatively small share of the fast-growing parcel market.""While eCommerce package volumes continue to grow significantly faster than the overall economy, Carol Tome is burying her head in the sand stating she wants to be better not bigger, and will not be investing much capital into expanding UPS's brick and mortar capacity. Meanwhile there other LOW COST, regional carriers transforming into national parcel carriers who will eventually replace the very high cost unionized UPS."
"Assuming that states slowly allow more and more businesses to re-open, I would think UPS would be doubly advantaged We'd continue to experience high residential volume while the b to b business would be returning. Our margins would slowly start to climb toward a more normal level albeit it will take time. But while this is happening, the Q2 report will be free of the forward guidance that couldn't be issued last month. So, seemingly, the key metric will be revenues and, in that regard, we're a lot better off than most companies. In addition, many of the dividend paying companies, including some of the venerable ""Dividend Aristocrats"", have had to either eliminate or reduce their dividends. According to CEO Tome, there is no risk of that happening at UPS. So, all things considered in the stock picking universe, I'd say things are looking up at UPS these days."
"OKLOK hub has leaking ceilings, broken AC units, no parking so we lease a lot from dell and rent a bus (disposing well over 150k annually) , a deteriorating hub, dirty package cars, and no morale because of the environment we work in. I’d imagine there is several hubs around the country experiencing the same thing."
"100 or so smaller delivery companies have banded together to form anoter delivery operation to be called the ""front door collaborative."" Clearly, the timeliness issues and rising expenses (surcharges) experienced by SMB shippers has opened new vistas for competitors. We'll see how they deal with weather and turnover issues during unpredictable peak seasons. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/an-army-of-amazon-delivery-services-are-joining-forces-and-ups-and-fedex-should-take-notice/ar-AANleVH"
"I wish Jim Casey was still around guiding this company along. I never met him but that man was a visionary genius. He grew the business, took care of the employees, partners, and the community successfully even during challenging times."
I dont think ive ever seen a day the entire market is down this much and UPS is up and big time at that
Thank you Lord for the Deep Discount today i bought at $195.50 see you all back to $210
"Worst service. All automated, no service. Will never use UPS in life."
Not much of a pop with the market this morning. What is it going to take to get this thing out of the rut it has been in for weeks?
"Will get worse, inflation on costs, buyers will stop spending too"
"what's with the freefall??? We need to stop reporting good news and getting buy recommendations. The more good news we get, the further it falls. Call it the false Amazon effect."
August 1st pay raises across the board plus cola. Ouch! That'll hurt the bottom line. Sell Sell Sell!! It's going back to where it belongs...under $100
"“For all the stress that’s being put on UPS’s and FedEx’s networks, they are actually handling things surprisingly well so far. For the third week of November, FedEx delivered 96.6% of its packages on time, while UPS delivered 96.9%, Jindel says. Some of the capacity shortfall can be made up through other services. But as the onslaught of e-commerce orders continues, there may be other pileups like those reportedly happening at Nike and other retailers this week.Of all of the years, this feels like the one to give a pass to UPS and FedEx for any delays that might arise. Orders will make their way to doorsteps eventually. If “eventually” happens to be two days after Christmas, who really cares? Millions of people are still out of work and more than 250,000 are dead. If your biggest problem is a delayed Christmas gift, count yourself lucky and spare a thought for the delivery employees at UPS and FedEx. These drivers and warehouse workers have borne the brunt of this year’s e-commerce deluge and have repeatedly risked their own health to allow many of us to order essentials from the comforts of our home. A federal advisory panel on Tuesday recommended health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities receive first priority for the coronavirus vaccine, meaning it may still be a while before essential workers like UPS and FedEx drivers are inoculated.”"
"with the U.S. govt printing money over last few years like there is no tomorrow, i just wonder when the tax man cometh. one would expect that taxes need to go up on both corporations and individuals. unfortunately what is going on is not sustainable. or responsible at this point."
"After the market shakes out from weak hands. Smart money moves into quality stocks like UPS and other segments like Steel (infrastructure) and 5G that will continue to benefit. Overblown reaction to FED tapering. First they will gradually ease and eventual interest hikes are coming off practically zero based rates now, so not a big deal as money remains cheap. It will take another year at least for JB to ruin the economy, but by that time REP will have taken back the Congress and checkmated the Clown."
"So I read the conference call transcripts today and one term stuck ot like nails on a chalkboard. ""laser focused"". It is almost as bad as the old ""the bottom line is"". When I hear these terms they are fluff and offer no real meaningful info to the presentations. Hopefully they will refrain in the future. We want facts not fluff."
the markets appear to be petering out ... and the gains are more focused to big tech. we are at nosebleed levels ..priced for perfection ... watch out ...
"amazon results not so hot. weaker volume than expected as people returned to stores. i am sure that helped to account for volume weakness at UPS. Of course UPS much prefers B2B volume. As UPS mgmt said, not all volume is created equal. The earnings report at UPS was very strong. Going forward they will stil generate significant cash flow. So i would expect buybacks to compensate for slower growth going forward."
"It sure seems like an investor over-reaction to a rational investor conference. No doubt not providing the earnings forecast or cost cutting plans dinged us as it always will. But in my view, the rest of the presentation was as expected. We're right in the ball park of analyst expectations regarding revenues for 2023 which seemed to have been the focus. We continue to pursue that level despite targeting the more lucrative SMB and health care volume and moving to protect ourselves from the Amazon ongoing delivery expansion. As a result, gross revenues might go down as better margins are preferred. Here's something I found odd. Overall, analysts are expecting UPS 2023 operating margins to come in around 13%. In a story generated by a Bloomberg reporter, he reported that UPS indicated 10.5% to 12%. HOWEVER, Reuters reported 12.7% to 13.7% which according to the UPS story on the website is the accurate number. It would seem Bloomberg should be issuing a correction as they are a major finance source and that is a major metric. I suspect as the conflict is resolved and perhaps more attention is focused on that true number, there is no reason why shares shouldn't rise. It would seem that UPS is doing things right to optimize profitable volume over taking small margin stuff that actually might be helping Amazon in its longer range, in house shipping goals. FDX got out early and we're apparently following suit while modifying our operations accordingly. My prediction is around $203 or so by week's end and a slow climb higher towards analyst targets in coming weeks. I think This reactionary drop to below $200 was a temporary blip and there's no reason to believe we're not solidly on the path that should be followed."
#$%$!! I can't figure out what this Company has to do to get a positive result from a very good qtrly report??????
"Interesting times in the supply chain world. Ocean freight rates are 10X what they were not all that long ago. In response, some Chinese manufacturers and exporters had tried to air freight merchandise as an alternative. But with stringent medical guidelines towards employees within the air cargo network in China is backlogged too according to a CNBC report this morning. Meanwhile, smaller, regional or even nationwide competitors to the UPS and FDX price structure dictates keep popping up. The landscape in the shipping sector is certainly in a state of flux."
Is FDX pulling us down today
Wow amazing this isn't jumping to $ 250 blew away earnings.
"Easy pre market trade, buy sell on kick back up in day"
"Sounds like the Morgan Stanley person that wrote the article about UPS , FDX and Amazon should be investigated. I wonder if he has Amazon stock in his portfolio or if bought puts on UPS and FDX. The price target for UPS is outrageous. He lowered the target price from where it is today by about 25%. Ups would have to lose Amazon and about 20% of its customers to drop that much. I hope people file a complaint to have him investigated."
"There are now robot prototypes that can grab a package out of a truck and walk it up to the door step and place it on the ground. I saw a video of one of these robots actually do a flip and land on its feet. There are currently numerous autonomous driving trucks on the road being tested, including at UPS. Automated conveyor systems currently handle the vast majority of packages at parcel company hub and EOL service centers. The parcel industry is very ripe to be transformed within the next few years, and UPS is EXTREMELY vulnerable because of their very high cost structure and unionized workforce. The Teamsters will NEVER agree to allow the vast majority of their driver jobs to be replaced by autonomous vehicles and robots for delivery once the technology is fully developed and begins to be adopted by the competition. Google, Apple, Uber, ODFL, or someone else will be standing ready, willing and able to invest billions of dollars to build out a new national parcel service that is nearly fully automated when the technology is refined. The days of a UPS package driver making an average of $95k a year in wages in overtime, plus another ~$35k in benefits for performing largely unskilled work that can be automated will be coming to an end. The Teamsters will be UPS's downfall."

"For those who are trying to figure out why this is coming down, I have a thought. If you notice that the price rolled over at about 6:22PM last night. That time coincides at the same time Jim Cramer was bashing UPS and FDX on MAD Money. His bad comments were in response to a chartist who said that companies like UPS and FDX usually turn down hard during Christmas season. The thing that really #$%$ me off is that I'm one of his (payed) club members and he's been pushing UPS for weeks. Literally 2 hours before the show he told the members that it was extremely undervalued. I think my membership is coming to and end. I still feel from doing some good DD that this will recover very nicely, but that two faced act by Cramer almost seems illegal.Good Luck longs."
another totally illogical reaction to What was mostly a positive second-quarter report
carroll blowme doesn't even know what a package is. This stock is a buy......at $60!
Both UPS and FDX laying eggs this morning. I can see no reason other than a generally poor tape.
Fewer shipments which makes sense.
They had some interesting insights about UPS on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Nothing goes straight up, and this will not go straight down. Will have a nice bounce today, Thursday, Friday, or Monday."
could see a pull back to 202 before the rise
"This is a whole lot of #$%$ and price rigging from Wall Street. UPS beat every expectation. With new Covid lockdowns and Christmas, UPS will continue to blow apart analysts numbers. But because UPS chooses to be responsible and can't give an accurate guidance into the next 2 quarters, Wall Street is screaming this to be a negative. Also, UPS has taken a stance of applying profits toward NEW Hub renovations, new warehousing, planes and trucks instead of taking on new debt. This is #$%$ off big banks that facilitate these loans and holding down UPS's credit rating. All in an effort to gobble up share on the cheap! 10million went cheap today!"
"Gonna moooon, bought calls today, meant to buy puts, smoking the curlf"
Really hard to believe no bounce today.
"First truck with vaccine left Pfizer, shipped by UPS and FedEx + holiday shopping = $200 share price"
"In case people hadn't seen this, UPS was FAR AND AWAY the most efficient delivery service during peak. FDX was way behind us (independent contractors a bit too independent on service levels?) and USPS as we all know was overwhelmed. This bodes well for the Q4 report. Congrats to all that made it happen. https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/01/07/ups-ranks-no-1-in-on-time-deliveries-during-the-holiday-season/?fbclid=IwAR2p0AQ0vYtmJHmT2BOqBugWYRtz-LUIa4dakNguFvlNkobVaSCnxZQ9Gik"
"For those of us who have been shareholders for a long time, it's quite a change of pace to morph from a value stock to a growth stock. Our earnings growth has been terrific and the dividend which used to be well ahead of the 10 year, now is barely ahead of that metric. But that's great! We still get our consistent dividend and the share price has had a really nice ride with more expected going forward."
In general it is a 50/50 splits between B2B and B2C delivery for UPS. And in the recent quarter the B2C deliveries gain traction. Is this really that bad? In the short term maybe. But this will at least keep things moving so to keep the employee employed and keep them busy before it recover. Why do everyone has to be so short-sighted? It is a solid company with a nice 4% dividend that I feel good holding at these price level. GLTA UPS Investors
"UPS is a BUY right now. This peak season should be very positive for UPS.Since FDX is no longer shipping packages for Amazon, Amazon is in trouble this peak. Last year the Post Office was not able to keep up with the Amazon package volume. This year will be the same. Amazon needs UPS and has now started shipping more packages with UPS. Amazon can try to convince investors that they are a shipping company but they are not. They can get drivers because they pay 50% less that UPS or FDX and they only guarantee them a couple of hours a week.. They don't have the package density to sustain driver drivers owning their own vehicles. Any driver that buys his own vehicle will lose money."
"I think this will go to $130 this year, a lot is in UPS favor. 1. Obviously, internet sales and shipping will drive volume. 2. Surcharges will drive Rev growth, plus at some point in the near future 3. the post office will raise rates to look profitable and lift market pricing up. That's a lot of tailwinds, with the only risk if Amazon is silly enough to enter last mile delivery. And the more they dabble in delivery, I think the more they learn it is capital intensive, Operationally difficult, and low margin - prob not the best use of their capital vs say focusing on Pharma or Banking. So I think UPS is a good, safe, med-longer term play. It won't give you crazy returns, but I think the 4% dividend + a steady approx 6%-8% equity appreciation is very reasonable."
labor costs could be an issue going forward for those not under temasters contract .... fdx stock price fell due to labor cost pressures ... teamsters contracts are in place -but costs for other workers?
i have family that does uber and doordash. i think uber is more profitable if you dont mind picking up strangers in your vehicle. i wonder about doordash - does the person doing doordash take into account the wear and tear on the vehicle? or are they doing all the work while the service makes the money? i wonder about all these same day services popping up in the same way. i hope people really figure in their costs when determining if its profitable. might just be better to get a regular job {although hours not as flexible}.
It has been a while since I owned anything quite so lifeless. A month since earnings with almost no movement. Very disappointing.
Pretty amazing this is still at $192. Feel sorry for all the sad people a few months from now that are gonna wish they nabbed a peace of this pie at this price!
Here comes the CEO on CNBC next
Back up the truck.
"What a dog! Just when I think the action cannot get any worse it does. Any spike is immediately sold. There does seem to be a base around $190.00, but there is also a ceiling about $192.75. I would have thought the buyback announcement would have snapped it out of it's range. I was wrong."
"lol, the trend is now up. under promise and over deliver. Back above $200 soon. Look at the divy?"
"Nice relative strength. Not quite out of the post earnings rut, have to close over $198.07, but getting there. Nice confirmation of yesterday's move in a bad tape. Would have liked to see more volume, but still no real complaints from me today. $200 by Friday? Dare to dream."
"Cannot blame FDX for todays action, what a dog!"
"MF has it right. If you are worried that Covid will push people out of stores again to shop at home, -UPS has you covered. What i worry more about when it comes to UPS is not Covid, but the cut backs in unemployment and other govt aid. That will mean less money for people to spend. Of course, it seems there are a lot of job openings. So people will ultimately need to go back to work. Not making any judgements here. Just looking at it from investor standpoint."
Don’t spend all your cash in one shot. Buy a little $UPS today and some tomorrow or Friday. Evidently somebody does not love Carol. ￼￼
Can I see a $195 print today?
"It should be safe to assume that the vast majority of those on this site are UPS shareholders and employees or why be here? That said, the country is clearly in the throes of a deepening recession with no clear end in sight. As UPS interested.parties, we are better off than most. Being able to depend upon a stable 4%+ dividend allows us not to be overly concerned about the wild fluctuations in share price. UPS continues to make a handsome profit (albeit nothing like the early part of Q1). Comparisons of past EPS, margins and profit should not be the concern right now but rather total revenue and how the company is adapting to the changing environment. For those working, unless some folks can say otherwise, I don't believe hours are being cut or benefits lessened. For those retired, I suspect most are like me with a pension, SS income and the regular dividend. We're lucky and can afford to sit tight and await the day when the economy can throw off the shackles and move forward. In the interim, we'll continue to handle significant volume (although admittedly it will be a less desirable b to c mix) as we continue to make considerable profits. I'll conclude by saying that I really hope the administration backs off its recent decision to bring China tariffs into its cross-hairs again. It's hard to imagine who's interests that serves at this juncture in the global slowdown."
"Playing for a bounce. Bought 75 Sept 21 200 calls this morning at $2.85. Let's see what happens over the next week or so. I think it bounces to $200, $210 if I am lucky."
"Here's a good summary of the relationship between UPS and Roadie. It looks like they're on track to be our same day, localized delivery arm. It's a gig driven model with the requisite tracking features. Hopefully, the Teamsters see the need for competitive purposes. UPS Teamster part-timers could always get a job @ Roadie too- maybe with UPS priority recommendation? https://www.roadie.com/resources/press-releases/roadie-series-a"
We better be on our toes. Here comes Maersk into the e-commerce sector in a big way. They'll have rapid access to parcels from the docks and plan to have a potential for 48 hour delivery. They'll be able to provide relief for dock backlogs as we wait for volume to clear. UPS and the Teamsters need some real agreeable flexibility to meet such competition imaginatively and head-on. https://www.freightwaves.com/news/a-closer-look-at-maersks-budding-e-commerce-operations
"This went down because the CEO of UPS made some miss-statements and then went on CNBC to clarify and said that they were going to discuss buyback at next meeting in less than 2 weeks and also that 50% was going towards a dividend so divy will get increased. Keep buying, and bought again on this dip."
"^ UPS is UP ^, near 52wk and all-time up ^ %^)"
This is a great opportunity to open or add to position. I opened a sizable position in 3 of my accounts. Looking for 2.5-3.5 percent by the end of the week.
Is there any other legacy S&P 500 dividend aristocrat company like UPS that bases their dividend yearly on 50% of their revenue earnings as opposed to increasing once a year incrementally? A company whose dividend fluctuates (up and down) yearly based on the year it's having. Is this Carol thinking way outside the box or am I misunderstanding what she is saying?
"If this drops below $185, prepare to load up."
