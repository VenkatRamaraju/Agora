"I guess we have seen enough to put some perspective into the developing results. Smaller is not better and UPS Has gotten where it is because bigger is better and always has been. That attitude will get us in trouble - a company that is not growing is a company heading down hill. I went to work for UPS in 1955 when we were just going into common carriers and the B to B part and growing slowly but surely the business and we had done very well. That’s all changing now and are facing more and more varied competition that intend to take as much of our business as they can. Just this morning I read of another company investing in’ Parcel Ships’ - anyone want to guess what that will do to our volume by Air to and from the world? Hint, not bigger. Look at what is happening with the Dividends and that’s just the beginning. We need “ Bigger and Better “ and the desire and fortitude to make it happen not just waiting around for our business to shrink slowly and surely. What ever happened to our drive to make it happen. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."
"What a dog! Just when I think the action cannot get any worse it does. Any spike is immediately sold. There does seem to be a base around $190.00, but there is also a ceiling about $192.75. I would have thought the buyback announcement would have snapped it out of it's range. I was wrong."
"Walmart announces Go Local next day and 2 day local delivery service. Also read an article a few months ago where Walmart expanded their driverless delivery testing to a second location. When UPS, FedEx, and USPS can't offer the speed and quality of service needed, at an economical price, then new competitors will emerge and the lower cost regional parcel carriers will expand their footprints. Have you seen the Domino's commercial where they are piloting driverless deliveries? Did you see Elon Musk announce he's going to develop a robot prototype that can perform basic tasks before end of next year? It's just a matter of time before many of the existing parcel delivery drivers will be replaced by new technologies and lower cost drivers.....which doesn't bode well for UPS and their relationship with the Teamsters down the road. The storm clouds are beginning to form on the horizon for UPS, the highest cost carrier in the industry that also has a union anchor around its neck."
"The peak season options for lower rates keeps expanding. For the last few years, we squeezed our customer base in an effort to juice profits. Looks like we're facing a bit of pay back time. We should be looking at acquisitions and discussing all this with Teamster leadership. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lone-star-overnight-simplifies-peak-221500852.html"
i'm not sure why you would want any more volume.............every supervisor is doing hourly work now..........brought 13 new hires in for intro to company..............1 showed up...................be happy with share price but sooner or later we will have union employees to replace our supervisors working.....just saying
"So ""Retail sales and industrial production each slowed more than expected in the world's second-largest economy (China)in July(according to the propaganda media). Generally speaking this should help stem the trade imbalance and also enhance the capacity utilization in both directions with UPS aircraft. Usually there is excess lift from the U.S. to China but lack of capacity feeding the U.S. from China. If this is true the balance of trade would lead to balanced flights to and from. The end result is UPS has more manageable profitable flights overall. That is assuming this isn't just a temporary blip on the radar."
"Trying to wrap my thoughts around an accounting question. If you don't raise the dividend doesn't that translate into the ""free cash flow"" area on the balance sheet? The money has to show up somewhere. Valid thoughts anyone??? On the earnings call I believe Carol touted the highest FCF in 6 months that normally would take a year. Isn't that just an accounting gimmick achieved by holding off on paying a dividend increase?"
"UPS infrastructure is bought and paid for. The union let UPS implement a new pay rate(last contract) for new drivers called 22.4 drivers. The drivers pay rate is at a much lower level then senior employees and they stay at the lower pay rate until a senior driver retires or new work transpires. Volume this peak will be high and if the new covid stain hits hard, watch the volume skyrocket again. Rumor has this stock going to 300. Just saying..."
"I noticed something odd today (Saturday) and I wonder if others have as well. There was a young driver (a part-time driver or whatever the category is now) pulled on the side of a pretty busy street in a P600 or larger package car. He was carrying a pretty bulky package and had to cross the street so I stopped for his convenience. I must admit, I've been retired for very long and was not in operations so the terminology on package car size and driver classification probably is not accurate. But what is accurate is he was wearing UPS shorts but a white t-shirt. I've never seen that before. Have things changed that much? FDX, Amazon, and Post Office delivery people are readily identifiable. While I'm at it, have others noticed Amazon drivers scooting along on their routes with their van side door open? Is it makeshift air conditioning? I wonder about parcels inadvertently falling out. Of course, I wonder about a lot of things these days....."
"Wow, clearly nobody cares about the dividend."
"Interesting times in the supply chain world. Ocean freight rates are 10X what they were not all that long ago. In response, some Chinese manufacturers and exporters had tried to air freight merchandise as an alternative. But with stringent medical guidelines towards employees within the air cargo network in China is backlogged too according to a CNBC report this morning. Meanwhile, smaller, regional or even nationwide competitors to the UPS and FDX price structure dictates keep popping up. The landscape in the shipping sector is certainly in a state of flux."
"This is an incredibly important article that explains how both management and the Teamsters need to view the future in a macro sense. It's how we compete against the less constrained moves of our competition that'll secure and increase jobs. More and more players are entering the field with cost effective strategies not to mention what FDX, WalMart, Amazon and some other box stores are eyeing. A non-combative approach to negotiations offering needed flexibility would seem in everyone's best interests since it is a 5-year contract. UPS remains the highest paid employees in the industry and will continue to be when this contract is settled. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teamsters-election-may-hold-cards-140324977.html ."
"Nice relative strength. Not quite out of the post earnings rut, have to close over $198.07, but getting there. Nice confirmation of yesterday's move in a bad tape. Would have liked to see more volume, but still no real complaints from me today. $200 by Friday? Dare to dream."
"Consensus EPS for 2021 is currently $10.95, and $11.56 for 2022. That represents growth of only a little over 5%, yet the PE is still nearly 18X which reflects a growth company. UPS is not a growth company, nor does it want to be according to the ""better, not bigger"" strategy adopted by the former CFO of Home Depot who is now functioning as the senior co-CFO at UPS instead of the CEO that she was hired to be. There was a reason why Home Depot passed over Tome when their CEO position opened up, and refused to promote her to be their next CEO even though she was a female and they would have received a lot of kudos from the liberal/marxist/progressive press for doing so. Home Depot knew Carol was a good conservative numbers person, but didn't have the strategic vision and leadership to be their CEO. With only 5% growth in earnings being projected for 2022, and not much more than that for top line revenue growth, UPS should be valued with a PE of only around 12X. Particularly when you factor in the risk associated with the next Teamster contract renegotiation which isn't that far away....and Tome and the new CFO are rookies that lack credibility when dealing with the Teamsters. Look for the Teamsters to be contentious this go around and push the rookies around, including a potential work stoppage that would be disastrous. When you evaluate the risk and reward of owning UPS stock at the current stock price, I think many will conclude there is a much higher downside than upside. FedEx is a much better buy at the current stock price."
Another nice dividend capture this week and poised to break above $200. Fall back after stellar earnings was a false narrative for big boys to pick up shares from week retail traders.
UPS is going to mandate workers get the jab according to a Reuters article posted 8/24. That should do wonders for driving the share price down further. They quote in the article that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been granted full approval. My understanding is that they don't manufacture that vaccine version because it does not have the liability shield as the non-FDA approved one does. Does anyone really know the truth?
"Well, well, well, look who finally had a good day. A break out of the recent range above the 15 DMA on decent volume. Another dollar and we can hopefully put the earnings debacle behind us. While I don't want to be greedy, a follow through tomorrow would be nice even if it is only 50 cents. Don't know what drove it today. Some vague news about surging container rates? Nice, but that doesn't seem to be worth 3 bucks. I will take it, but still looking for real good news that will take this over $200.00."
Purchased two shares today. UPS is beginning to grow on me.
"So when they buyback shares is the primary purpose to increase shareholder value or is it to get additional shares to put in their pockets via stock options on merit pay and performance? If so that would have a net effect of really not doing anything beneficial to shareholders. I think alot of these tidbits put out for the benefit of the uneducated investor leads to hype (which is a good thing), but not with much substance to back it up. Who decides when to flick the switch on share purchases based on shares being undervalued? Whomever decides that wields significant power. Is it done by group decision of the CEO, or the board as a whole? It seems that another function that wield tremendous power to drive the price is the PR department which can gin up excitement for a stock by pushing positive news on a frequent and steady basis. Hopefully those people's efforts are not taken for granted."
Volume drives share price. Currently institutions must be sitting on the sidelines. Volume is half the average rate traded per day. To get this thing moving there needs to be good news of one form or another.
Little confused about Carol's announcement on a new dividend payout target of 50% of earnings and how they will implement.
"Decent day, kinda fizzeled into the close with the rest of the market. Green is better than red. Volume has returned to normal. RSI still says oversold."
"Does anyone think this will drop back into the $180 range? Looks like they might be planning to fill a gap there. And no, I’m not short. I’m hoping it goes back up."
Not much of a pop with the market this morning. What is it going to take to get this thing out of the rut it has been in for weeks?
"So what's going on with UPS? Why is there such a big push to drive it below 190? This is certainly worth more than that, what am I missing? Dow closed over 35k yet UPS goes way down..."
"100 or so smaller delivery companies have banded together to form anoter delivery operation to be called the ""front door collaborative."" Clearly, the timeliness issues and rising expenses (surcharges) experienced by SMB shippers has opened new vistas for competitors. We'll see how they deal with weather and turnover issues during unpredictable peak seasons. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/an-army-of-amazon-delivery-services-are-joining-forces-and-ups-and-fedex-should-take-notice/ar-AANleVH"
"Since the CC I've been searching through financial websites looking for Tome's ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" terminology in any financial spread sheet, I have yet to find it. Anyone on this board know what the outsider is trying to say..in simple English?God Bless us all,Michael"
"if you read harvard business review, Tome's resume fit the bill for what they are looking to accomplish while the other execs gain more experience. apparently, they were not ready to fill the ceo chair. the person that was slated for the job was jim barber, and he unexpectedly retired."
"A.P. Moller-Maersk, the parent of container shipping giant Maersk Line, just spent nearly $1 billion to add two logistics companies that will bring the ocean carrier PARCEL-delivery capabilities. Maersk CEO Soren Skou tells the WSJ Logistics Report that with $11.5 billion in free cash flow in a surging shipping market, the operator has “quite a substantial war chest” and may even complete more acquisitions this year. Maersk’s capacity strategy right now is focused on land, as it looks to build up more stable business with big enterprise customers under long-term contracts.When the U.S. Post Office and UPS refuse to invest capital to expand capacity to match the growth in eCommerce growth, there will be other players step up and invest the capital needed to address the market demand. Amazon was forced to spend tens of billions of dollars to create their own asset based logistic's network when UPS, USPS, and FedEx were unable to provide them the capacity and service quality they needed. Walmart is starting to follow suit. The regional parcel carriers are growing so fast that at least one of them has refused to accept any more customers until next year after they expand capacity. Yet good ole UPS says better not bigger is their strategy, and only wants to invest around 4% of revenue in capital despite competing in the global logistics marketplace where eCommerce is growing in the 10%+ range around the world. This is opening the door for more competitors to enter the market, and regional parcel carriers to significantly invest more capital to expand their footprints. UPS has decided to adopt a strategy of price gouging their customers and milking their assets to increase margins and cash flows......but will one day wake up to discover they're the next TWA, Kodak, Eastern Airlines, Bethlehem Steel, or perhaps the U.S. Post Office losing billions of dollars a year with their extremely high cost, unionized business model."
"Just to add one other observation and would be nice if Carol were listening. Investors hate the word slowdown. And she used it twice. During Cramer’s interview, she bragged about calling it a year ago. No need to share that with the investment world.That will panic a lot of investors.Call it a re-normalizing B to B and B to C. And leveling volume spikes is a good thing."
"When viewing the better/bigger controversy, one only needs to look at the pricing model airlines use. When demand is strong your seat costs more. And that’s how package pricing will work as well. Forget the loyalty thing. Shippers care about price and performance. When UPS needs more volume, we will adjust the pricing to fill the void. The key is to maintain the best performance…on time and as promised. The immediate need is to fill the gap for weekend deliveries and transport and the Teamsters need to see that as well. Competition demands it."
We better be on our toes. Here comes Maersk into the e-commerce sector in a big way. They'll have rapid access to parcels from the docks and plan to have a potential for 48 hour delivery. They'll be able to provide relief for dock backlogs as we wait for volume to clear. UPS and the Teamsters need some real agreeable flexibility to meet such competition imaginatively and head-on. https://www.freightwaves.com/news/a-closer-look-at-maersks-budding-e-commerce-operations
Pretty amazing this is still at $192. Feel sorry for all the sad people a few months from now that are gonna wish they nabbed a peace of this pie at this price!
"I wish Jim Casey was still around guiding this company along. I never met him but that man was a visionary genius. He grew the business, took care of the employees, partners, and the community successfully even during challenging times."
"On today's UPS Alumni Webcast, Carol stated that there will be.... ""good news at the end of the year regarding dividends"""
"Cannot blame FDX for todays action, what a dog!"
"Biggest problem UPS has now is the messenger. The financials are fantastic. Free cash flow is currently more in 6 months than any previous year. Abney did a great job setting the table. Tome and Newman are great bean counters and technicians. Unfortunately, not good on camera or doing interviews. The June investment conference was a disaster and so was her latest reporting. The message is great, the delivery not so good!"
"Biggest problem with UPS today is the market manipulators pulling the strings. When a single institutional holder or two control a good percentage of shares the tail is basically wagging the dog. It really doesn't matter how good or bad earnings are, but it is all about timing of their agenda and when THEY feel like playing the stock up or down. Control and power are all they really care about because it gives them the house winning edge in the market casino."
This is a fascinating company. For small companies (part of our target group) this presents what would appear to be a pretty nice option. Price wise they can't be beat and the convenience is unmatched. A company can request pick-up or drop it off at Post office. It's a 2-day service and purports to deliver nationwide. It has over 1 million customers in the U.S. after having proven its business model in Australia. This is yet another competitor UPS needs to be very aware of. Has anyone used this service or know someone who has? https://try.sendle.com/en-us/how-sendle-works
I want to explain more of my thoughts on how we can make bigger better as we have done for more than a hundred years. We have always had people that think “outside the box” looking for better ways to do things and it is always good to have them in all functions if possible. That’s where most ideas come from for growing the business and controlling our costs . Thinking outof the box includes finding related business that compliments the established parts and those that become extensions to our business including diversified business. We don’t need limits but should be open to anything that we can fit in that will assist our growth. Bigger is Better.Thanks for listening.
