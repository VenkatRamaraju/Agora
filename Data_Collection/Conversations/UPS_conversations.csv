"amazon seeking old outdated cargo jets to fly their goods, most likely into the ocean. geez...i shop at amazon but i gotta ask myself why? they treat their workers like garbage. or as the article i read states, like robots. so why should i patronize such a company? i've shifted more to costco and even walmart. i never joined prime. costco has always been great to their workers. wish there was one close to where i live. i would definitely be a member and shop there. now i just shop at costco as a guest online and it is still a very good deal."
"There’s a different Rick out there bragging how he sold. Guy needs to grab a different handle. I, Rick, have not sold and will watch this stock fly through peak season. This other Rick wants to buy pack at $200. NOT!! Buy back now cuz next stop is 220’s!!"
"Christmas & Hanukkah￼ won’t happen unless $UPS, airlines and railroads $UNP is delivering the goods."
"So this morning Evercore began coverage of UPS with an outperform rating and $225 price target, specifically praising “better not bigger” and the pricing power and operating efficiency that go along with it. Seeking Alpha also very bullish on their comments. After receiving a delivery from Chewy last night at 9:30 from a outsourced FedEx driver in a swimsuit and no shirt driving a beat up car I was convinced my investment in UPS was much better off."
"Thank you Joe and your terrible policies. I have to admit I was wrong, didn't think the markets would crash in the first year of your term. Liberal/socialist policies take from hard working Americans who invest and build the economy."
United Parcel Service is up 4.98% to 214.06
Do you guys follow http://alert-sounds.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the UPS board - The alerts have been great!
"Was an owner of both UPS and FDX, but this week I dumped my FDX stake to buy more UPS. At the moment, UPS has less problems than FDX due to both its labor being unionized and also being more of a grounds transportation company than FDX. UPS may have a higher multiple than FDX, but the underlying business indicates the multiple is more than warranted. FDX has been mostly a headache for me to own for the last few years. I also think the current UPS CEO is a rock star. Firmly believe that by trading my FDX shares for more UPS that my money will thank me. In fact it has already begun to due to today’s blockbuster quarter."
UPS is in Bill Gates' top 10 portfolio holdings.
UPS has real employees not subcontractors. Makes all the difference
"I was a driver for 31 years, still have a lot of friends that are currently employed at UPS. They are paying drivers tons of overtime (60.00 an hour). They can not find new help with the start pay they’re paying. Drivers are making 2600.00 a week, that with fuel prices and other rising cost are going to really eat into their profits. The overall moral is very low(even with their fat paychecks) management especially are getting burned out with more hours and more upper mismanagement."
"So FedEx missed. What they missed was the opportunity a year ago to shore up their volume mix. When they dumped Amazon they immediately went after any and all volume, good and bad. At the same time, their turnover of employees went through the roof. The result: #$%$ service ( 83.7% on time), and poor image. Now, they?re adopting Tome?s playbook and trying to find the right formula of volume and revenue. UPS is on a much better track and will have a blowout quarter when they report. Buy now and buy big!"
UPS is continuing to report high 90’s on time volume. You can’t do that by diverting packages. Sources tell me hubs are full but not crazy full. We’ll see in another month if better not bigger is working but I think so.
Why would anyone sell this now? Down almost 6 points on the day?
We got a big endorsement from Stifel this morning. An upgrade to buy with a 20% increase in price by the end of the year based on peak and UPS strategy. Stifel is one of the tougher analysts to impress so their endorsement is a big deal. The premarket bump seems to agree as well. Should be a winning day!
"Thomas you are so wrong. Employees make careers out of UPS. Most start part time inside but then move into driving, where they can earn twice what FedEx pays. FedEx uses contract drivers, not even “employees”, hired by an outside contractor. Not possible at FedEx to move up from an entry level position. So UPS gets many more qualified applicants."
"Stifel analyst J. Bruce Chan upgraded United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS) to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $224 (implying an upside of 21.69%) from $210. So let me get this straight- Chan so far off on his price target, and he is increasing it even more. oh boy. if it gets to $224 by some miracle over the next year -sell your shares and accept the gift."
Really wishing I would have bought more in the $180-190 range. Could we see another pull back in the next 6 months ?
"One question; Who is the ""analyst"" at Morgan Stanley that valued UPS at $135? And have they been fired yet?"
Another great quarter!!
Bill Gates is big on UPS. One of his top 10 holdings. Buy buy buy !
Below 200 to buy all in
"how are the supply chain issues, fuel prices going to affect UPS? also, looks like the market may get a 5% correction with poor GDP numbers, inflation, rise in interest rates...will this fall at the same rate, greater or less than the market?"
Upgrades incoming rest of the week. Just wow. Thank you Carol.
ups may be a buyout tgt if WMT really want to compete with AMZN

How is UPS going to compete for employees for peak when Amazon and several other are paying $18 per hour plus ?
I am staying far away from UPS - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
UPS face same problems of FDX.

"So now we see the post office adding their holiday season surcharges along with FedEx and UPS. It just costs more to complete deliveries when the system is overloaded and the carriers have finally figured it out… in unison. Hey, I don’t like paying more to fly home at Christmas, but supply and demand. Looking for a very profitable peak season."
"Up over 4% in Pre-Market action, pretty good! Who is going to buy an extra cup of coffee today? I will!"
Wow- it just gets more and more amazing. Here Walmart is one-upping the same day delivery scenario by preparing to go the autonomous driving route. It seems a company can never stop its innovation path to cut costs and serve customers. Having roadie in the network will be great.

"I was very bullish on this position after the recent drop below $200. I am beginning to feel more neutral. I only have 2 shares. Is this a good time to buy, or could it drop lower?"
It should not be overlooked that global supply chains are under tremendous stain. This story really hit home in regards to how sea borne shipping workers feel at risk. We tend to think of this as just a Los Angeles and the U.S. West Coast port issue. One thing that has resulted from all this port delay is companies are securing their needed inventories now to make sure they can meet their customer's needs. The UPS Ware-to-Go survey indicates that a 2 day at most delivery window is a key selling point to customers. But the carriers have to hit the service levels or they will ultimately pay the price. https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/business/supply-chain-workers/index.html
Carol Tome!Nice numbers at a glance.
"I can guarantee!!! That no matter how well UPS does on tomorrows call. There will be some obscure detail that will be credited for little or no gain over what you see today! However, I'm not complaining. I am still thrilled we have made the gains we have to date and can only pray that they can maintain!"
"Bought in June at $202, sold this week at $219 and made a quick $6,800. Will buy back in once it gets back around $200 again. If it doesn't I really don't care there are so many other good options and good possibilities out there. This market has just been wonderful the past 2 years, even with Covid. I have investing for close to 4 decades and this is best environment to make money that I remember. S&P, NASDAC, DOW at or near all time record highs, jobs going wanting, all time low interest rates, economy is STILL recovering, bitcoin booming, demand for housing at all time highs, new industries and technology boom and are being created almost overnight, anyone want to go into space? infrastucture getting billions and billions of additional spending, USA is out of all wars, how can things get any better? Yes, yes, inflation, chip shortage, shipping and transportation backlogs. Small potatoes. Make money and spend it and enjoy!"
if ups goes up tomorrow after the earnings announcement i'll pull a stromboli out of my asp ..
so an analyst upgrades the stock and everyone runs out and buys it. pretty funny. so if the analyst says to jump off a bridge i suppose a lot of folks would do that too. can't folks think for themselves? even with all the alcohol in my system my brain cells can still process information and make a decision without relying on some bogus analysts to tell me what to do with my money. the analysts work for brokerages and are there to generate business. upgrade downgrade downgrade upgrade ...so folks keep buying and selling....
UPS after hours is down 4 bucks with the sympathy play. Fortunately they have always executed their business plan and deliver when they say they will. Currently they are having no trouble hiring due to their reputation as a decent place to make a career. As long as they continue to execute the plan I see no headwinds going forward.
i think we hit bottom today. i am actually somewhat optimistic going forward. supply chain issues should lessen over the next year. covid will begin to recede into something more manageable. the wildcard seems to be the chinese economy- with real estate and debt issues.
UPS has now gotten into same day delivery! I feel this is huge news! I feel the stock will continue to go higher.
"it's pretty much at fair value now ...trading at more than 17x NEXT YEARS earnings. personally, i am happy if it stays at this price into the summer of next year. with teamsters contract up in 2023, the summer ofnext year is a good opportunity to evaluate the position. even if labor markets start to ease, the contract will be a tough negotiation."
Easy money. Back in on dip from panicked novices. Thank you.
220 calls looking great!
"UPS up >200 again, and back to >one-bagger for me, not counting the divies.. not too shabby %^)."
"Hearing the price target is $205 by the end of the year. It will be a strong holiday season for UPS. Hiring 100,000 seasonal workers for the Holidays. I only have 2 shares but looking to add more eventually."

Watching FDX stock plummet day after day since their earnings report might we see the same at months end ? Thoughts?
"retail gonna do pretty good ... consumers shopping with abandon for the holidays ..people realize life is short ...they dont look at price tags ...just put it on their credit cards... there are still many flush with cash too.. so luxury retailers should do particularly well. the balance sheets on quality retailers are solid too, as shift to internet shopping has improved margins. luxury retailers have pricing power as well to offset inflationary pressures - and chip shortage wont impact apparel .... gl ...megatron, slayer of worlds"
UPS is good but FDX is excellent
220 after holiday season!
"UPS investors need to pay attention to what UAW is demanding from Deere, and what Deere ends up conceding. Given the current pro union leftist administration, and tight labor supply, look for unions to become very bold and militant. The Teamsters are already on written record as calling for more ""militant"" members and action against management in upcoming negotiations. It isn't going to bode well for UPS when their contract is re-negotiated within 2 years, and the union militant leadership will be looking to muscle their will on the naive and inexperienced Carol Tome. FDX is the much better buy at the current stock price and PE multiples, but also has their own leadership problems as they appointed a Marketing guy who has no operational or financial management experience to be both their CEO and COO. Fred needs to appoint a strong COO to bring discipline back to FedEx."
Thank you Lord for the Big discount today $4 per share See you all at $189 per share
Hey I got a idea let's vote the democrats in again so they can tank the market!
SELL heretop is injmho
"Here's a listing of the analyst upgrades since the report. I'll single out the magnanimous Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley for special recognition. It seems he's channeling the crime ""pre-cog"" characters from the Tom Cruise movie ""Minority Report"" to visualize the UPS share price collapse that only he sees. After much further reflection on Q3 results and an elevated going forward advice, he's spring-boarded his target price from $130 to $135. Sometimes I wonder if this is in $USD or not? Anyway, here's the rest of them: Stifel 224>241, Raymond James 240>260; Oppenheimer 222>230, Loop Capital 220->226; Keybanc 235>250; Deutsche Bank 237?253; CRFA 233>241. I'm sure there will be more to come."
"Article today where UPS president mentioned that they will maintain strong levels of profitability. This is very good news. They are also hiring over 100,000 workers coming up. They also acquired Roadie which I feel is great news. I feel the future looks bright and this is a great time to buy on the recent pullback."
"what i find quite amazing is that volume actually went down from the same quarter last year by a few percent ... i'm not even gonna try to do the math, i am not sure it would add up ..on my side or theirs ... cost controls and some margin expansion? how else could they do it?"
Great company. Only have 2 shares at $191.
"Fdx ER reflect cost problem.......Sell ups stock is reasonableEspecially, ups stock only drop 2% at this moment."
"So, Yall know I got the 411 on the Phoenix and LA hubs. CHRISTMASS NUMBERS STARTED TWO WEEKS AGO. Hub managers are seeing a 3k to 5k package increase per day VS last year end of November numbers. Merry Christmass to us. So, I bought another 75k worth today."
"fdx took a shellacking when it disapppointed. i am thinking the upside is more limited than the downside here. ups has already rallied into earnings. i'd be surprised if ups goes much higher even with an earnings beat. in terms of guidance, you gotta figure they're gonna talk about wage pressures, high energy prices, and all those headwinds."
"So the markets back up 400 plus, but FedEx missed So UPS tanks.???"
in june ups produced 3.06 in earnings. the bar is set at 2.54 for this quarter. i think the company has of control over the #s it puts out to some extent -will their expense control be enough to offset some of wage labor pressures? we'll see. plus you have rising gas prices. they will need to keep up there with surcharges.
"If this quarter doesn’t solidify UPS’s comparative advantage over FedEx in the industry, I don’t know what else could. The extreme differences in performance paint the picture quite clearly. UPS, despite labor problems relating to higher costs, not only beat on earnings and revenue but they are continuing to widen the gap between FedEx and others. I’m expecting a nice run up past the 52 week high! Congrats to all!!!"
fed ex is more than ups because they have less shares on the marketthus less is more
The thing that makes this down turn so frustrating is the fact it's based on speculation and political BS!
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"Now that we've broached the $202 level, here's another enticing thought to throw out there. I believe it was during the last earnings report (or maybe the prior one) where Tome hinted that good dividend news would be announced at year's end. After the thoughtful and reasonable at the time modest $.01 increase this year, perhaps we resume a more normal $.05-$.06 increase of recent years. Thinking that the vast majority of UPS employees are shareholders, that's would be a solid way of rewarding them for their peak season efforts during this and last year's extraordinary times. ."
"JC, so tell us, are you an ex UPS supervisor that never made manager? Why so negative? Did you sell all your stock at $75?? UPS invested over $13 billion in Capex in 2018-2020 and took a lot of heat for it at the time. Abney stayed the course. HR will tell you UPS is not incurring the staffing issues at FedEx and the PO. The reason is simple. UPS drivers are the GOLD standard in the industry. The path to that job is thru the part time ranks in operations. It’s called opportunity, which UPS offers. UPS has now figured out how to manage peaks and valleys of volume distribution. Give credit where it’s due. Big Brown is firing on all cylinders!"
keep in mind that the main reason fedex is more than ups is because they have less stock on the mkt. thus less is more.
"i am megatron, slayer of worlds. ask me a question and i will give you the answer. that is, if i am sober. and it will be the correct answer. no worries."
"A lot of people seem to be fairly bearish on this board. Please feel free to start a conversation as i’d love to hear everyone’s input, but I believe it may actually be the opposite case. With the Global Supply Chain Crisis in play, retailers have no reserves. Shortages are hitting companies all over the country. People cannot buy items in stores, forcing people to turn to alternatives such as online shopping. I would think this translates to a higher demand for UPS and their services, correct???"
300 by end of CHRISTMAS
purchased something from costco the other day ... not the first time ... and it should be noted that they use UPS to deliver ...costco is a great company -treats their workers really well with good benefits and pay .. costco has done really well - a great alternative to amazon and you get your packages delivered by UPS .. at least in my area i know that is who they use ..
"my guess is that they may coe up a little short this quarter on the revenue side when compared to last year. i am not sure whether they can squeeze out an earnings win. so i am thinking the stock is dead money for awhile. go with enery, financials, commodities. that is where to make money in this market. good luck. Megatron, slayer of worlds"
sell sell
im sorry i posted what i did ... i apologize ...now ca the stock go higher? pls
Can anybody explain the major fall out of 2 1/2 bucks from the peak of today￼
"Anyone think we get past $300 in the next 3 years? I’ve been here since ~$92 and am considering profit taking. I took profits in TGT at $119 and feel like I left too much on the table. Could UPS run a lot more, or are we toppy?"
"So, what's going on around us as peak season nears? The director of the port of LA reports a massive backlog of 2 weeks of ships anchored. That equates to 200K containers with more coming. They're operating on a 24/7 schedule but as we know the scheduled removal of containers thru drivers and transport to the rails is fraught with delays. The reopening worldwide from the Pandemic and the subsequent supply chain collapse may perhaps alter the thinking away from just in time inventory to more of a warehousing system like the ""old days."" Meanwhile over at Amazon, they've announced plans to hire 150K more seasonal workers on top of a significant # of recent hires. In 2019, they paid these workers a minimum of $15. Now that pay rate is up 20% to $18 (more in selected areas) with in an unheard of $3K sign on bonus in certain competitive markets. All this hiring suggests volume is going to soar both within and outside of Amazon as on-line shopping is still as strong as ever. So no doubt our revenues will show a nice growth trend. The key is going to be controlling costs thru operational efficiencies, continuing to focus on profitable volume, expanding the weekend and same day offerings and looking for quickly accretive acquisitions to strengthen our service portfolio. The UPS plans are in place and we need to believe that the peak season weather conditions are no worse than in other years."
Talk about an ultra-competitive labor market. Look @ Amazon's plans for the 125K peak season workers they'll be pursuing. https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amazon-hiring-new-jobs-18-an-hour-51631617159?mod=mw_latestnews
"The port problem involvement is a big win for UPS. It will now dovetail the company into moving shipping containers all over the country. By the cost of getting the containers from International origins to the business customers in the U.S. UPS will have another large and very profitable source of additional revenue, The optics of their reliability will also benefit brand recognition. Another big win is for their Teamster drivers moving the product. Winning with infrastructure already in place."
my shares in companies that have not navigated the supply chain issues have taken some good hits. i think those supply chain issues will ease next year some time ... it is a temporary phenomenon. so it is an opportunity to acquire more shares at a discount. energy is still cheap. select retail will do well this holiday with folks out and about. financials have positive headwinds with interest rates rising. ups got its pop .... a decent one ...i don't know how it could get any better ... hopefully it holds onto its gains ..
"i am megatron slayer of worlds. we are in the midst of energy crisis. buy oil. buy gas. buy commodities. not so sure on ups. i think it stagnates for some time. you gotta go with the flow, and the flow is with the energy crisis, not against it .."
I had to average down on $UPS in the 180s but I’m very glad I did. I was sort of hoping Tesla would have UPS semi trucks ready for the holidays but maybe next year.￼
On its way to $170
too overpriced for a delivery company ( they are depreciation assets.)
"After the maintenance, UPS could rise to $245"
"my wife and i have a family that is mixed bag ..races, religions, preferences,,, as long as people are nice that is what matters to us. i just think the sensitivity pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. i recently heard a gym teacher talking to someone in a Dr's office. He wasn't allowed by the school to say "" boys line up over here and girls over there"". The school would not let him say that. So he was wondering what to say to get them all sorted out without getting fired. It was kind of comical to hear that. I just think it is a little crazy. I guess in order to be correct, he could say ""if you identify as a boy line up here, if you identify as a girl line up there, if you don't identify as either or you identify as both line up in the middle"". I suppose that would work."
"more of china common prosperity goals. clamping down on property sector. evergrande, i think largest developer in china, about to go bust. real estate is biggest investment in chna, far surpassing stock market for common investor. someone buying a property typically puts more money down than in U.S. i believe. Not sure how this will all play out. if china govt goes too far in clamping down on property speculation to drive down cost of buying a home, markets worried this will send china economy spiraling downhill."
"Would have to say Tome is delivering on her promise. She has reduced debt by $6M with free cash flow and we can expect that to continue. We know that interest rates are on their way up at some point to counter this inflation. Expected profit taking going on now but I would expect a $230 price by year end if we can break through this $217 resistance level. Confident this will happen as a productive, smooth peak season unfolds this year."
"FedEx will not be able to handle the holiday volumes, Fred who in name only said FedEx has a hiring problem no workers no movement no money. DHL UPS both look like good buy's. I waiting for FedEx to fall around the 120s. FedEx workers are going to be mad as a hiring freeze will happen. A post from a FedEx worker. I work at FedEx and my department is understaffed. It has been understaffed for about 6 months and they have a freeze on hiring. FedEx is not just handling parcels. There are so many officers and other departments that can not go with fewer workers. Lucky for me I’m the only one on my shift and am needed. Anything can happen.FedEx Office DEFINITELY has a layoff policy. And there likely is a hiring freeze. The company is putting out ads for workers but not hiring any of them. A hiring freeze is the only answer for that. Very frustrating."
BLOWOUT 26th
"A lot of UPS/FDX workers are part time who are looking to supplement their full time income as they try and raise a family, or are college kids trying to pay their way through college. Seasonal workers at UPS/FDX typically earn $2,000 to $4,000 over the peak season months depending upon when they start and how many weeks they work. The Democrats recently raised the annual tax credit/welfare payment for each child from $2,000 to $3,600, an annual increase of $1,600 per child. If you're a family of 4 with 2 children, that's an extra $3,200 a year. Biden also recently increased the food stamp payments for each person by around 25%, the highest increase in the history of the SNAP program. The average SNAP allowance will increase by $36.24 per person per month, which equates to $1,740 a year for a family of 4. That's nearly $5,000 a year in higher welfare payments for a family of 4. If the Dems are successful in making college free with the new social welfare programs they are trying to pass now, how many college kids are going to be willing to work at UPS or FDX at night as a significant portion of their part time workforce is made up of college kids."
This stock had a rough summer.
Why crashing today?
"""Better not Bigger"" UPS not going to invest much capital into expanding brick and mortar capacity, and will ""milk the assets."" That's the strategy of Carol Tome, former CFO at Home Depot who was passed over to be Home Depot's CEO when that positioned opened up....but was good enough to become UPS's CEO. What happens when there are only 3 national parcel carriers, and they are unwilling to expand brick and mortar capacity at a fast enough pace to accommodate the growth in the marketplace? The carriers price gouge their customers, on time service plummets, and new entrants enter the marketplace to fill the void. We saw Amazon invest BILLIONS to build their own transportation network when UPS, FDX, and USPS failed to make the investments necessary to accommodate eCommerce growth and provide Amazon with quality service at an economic price. We see Walmart is in the process of doing the same. Now we see low cost regional parcel carriers significantly accelerate their capex investments to expand their footprints to provide the needed capacity that UPS, USPS, and FDX are unable to provide. Case in point......LaserShip has just announced they want to extend their regional parcel-delivery operations across the entire U.S. They are buying Western rival OnTrac Logistics putting the business on a path to offer two-day shipping to nearly three-quarters of the U.S. population. LaserShip’s Josh Dinneen says he sees an opportunity to get bigger with an “aggressive expansion” plan next year that will fill in some areas like Chicago and Texas. DHL has also announced earlier this year that they will significantly increase their capex to expand their operations in the U.S. Despite there being record low interest rates to fund expansion of brick and mortar to accommodate growth i the marketplace, UPS, USPS, and to a lesser extent FDX choose to hunker down and pay down debt and increase dividends. The clock is ticking, and the high cost unionized carriers are the most vulnerable to losing significant share along with profit margins in the not too distant future. UPS will make a lot of money in the short term with their current no growth strategy, but will be the loser over time."
"I'm amazed that Fredex is up in premarket trading after their terrible earnings report last qtr. Seems ignorant investors think UPS and Fredex are much the same. Sorry folks, Fredex is in bad shape and no where near UPS in terms of good management and smart business."
Since we are either going into a recession or the 2nd great depression due to the communists it would be wise for UPS to pay down debt rapidly and make significant plans for such. The communists are destroying our country and only the strongest companies have any chance of survival....of course everything will be big box stores and megacorporations left....
"We have a lot of investors that have no idea what a bargain UPS is right now. Record profits, tons of recommendations from analysts, soon to be a big boost in dividend in early 2022. Get in while its CHEAP!!!!!!!!"
"there was a piece on Amazon and its logistics ambitions on CNBC. it was about 14 minutes. if it's out there, listen to it. amazon should start to offer its logistics services to businessses not using Amazon in less than a few years, maybe even within a year. amount of amazon volume doles out to ups 7 post office has been steadily going down. amazon rapidly growing air fleet. towards end of clip one analyst surmized that amazon will swallow up UPS. my thinking is that walmart could acquire or merge with UPS to compete with amazon. I think antitrust would come into play if amazon bought UPS. Possbily Amazon gobbles up FDX for its air routes after a Walmart takeover of UPS removes antitrust concerns. just my thoughts."
"$23 bucks separate UPS and FDX, UPS closing the gap"
"energy stocks taking off and they pay big fat dividends. this stock is going in the opposite direction. delivery companies are gonna have to put on surcharges to compensate for rising energy prices. that plus general price increases could even start to put a damper on internet shopping. energy sector has been under developed for several years, and big energy companies reluctant to invest as renewables seen replacing fossil fuels. so high energy prices may be here for a long while ...."
"We've busted thru or are rapidly approaching many of the analyst's targets. We simply have to chuckle at the demonic incompetence of the Morgan Stanley ""professional analyst"" who simply refuses to get off his ""sell' $130 stance. I wonder, has anyone heard him ask a question during an earnings call or at the investor conference? I wonder what verbalized absurdity sounds like?"
"So I’m hearing whispers that UPS will hit their numbers which is a good thing but our worry is how Tome will present it. So far she seems to be a half empty kind of spinner. She’ll have a lot of positives to hit on but as you know, future stock performance hinges on expectations. If she pushes the doom and gloom of inflation, worker shortages, supply chain back ups, etc., we could get slammed. If she stays positive, earnings day could be a plus."
Big pre market this morning. Looks like we're heading to $190 again. Huge news.
A pleasant surprise is they managed to not shoot themselves in the foot this goaround. I wonder how many shares they repurchased when it was down??? I wonder if the institutions try to manipulate the price to acommodate the price drivedown and subsequent recovery to enhance their profits????
"the algos that do most of their trading out there have moved some money out of UPS and are chasing their next target, whatever that is...they got their short term gain ...congrats to them ...."
Cramer said last week that he sold part of his UPS position because it had a nice run and was expecting a pull back. Since then its rallied another 20 bucks. Tonite's show he never mentioned this. He has convenient memory that always makes him look best.
"Just think that 10 days ago, UPS was at $178. Love to see us back in the $191 range."
"We can all agree that this was a fabulous 3rd quarter. Despite some tough weather conditions during the storm period, UPS performed on all cylinders. Giving solid going forward advice with a meaningful upgrade in margin expansion was huge. It's starting to look like UPS customers and share holders could consider FDX share price and service performance to be like shopping at Piggly Wiggly while by comparison UPS would be like heading over to Whole Foods. The ""better not bigger"" philosophy was once again proven to be prescient as domestic volume growth was down a bit but the margins were higher making it cost effective. With peak season around the corner and employees at a premium (Amazon in some areas paying a $3K sign on bonus and $18/hr), avoiding blow out volume keeps staffing costs under control and service levels high. FDX seems to have a meandering strategy to address those metrics."
place your bets ... beer here ...ice cold beer ................hotdogs .... pretzels .... popcorn .... get'em while its hot ...
I'm hoping the 3rd qtr. is good and presented well! I'm also concerned that Amazon continues to grow at a break neck pace! I know of 4 major distribution centers that are huge within 250 miles of each other as well as there newest push to acquire long range air craft to reach china?? I just hope Carol has an eye on that as well!
Stephen Weiss really is missing details on his BS report on Fredex. UPS has addressed every issue he brought up thats why UPS margins are 2x Fredex margins. UPS LONG ALL THE WAY!!
energy stocks doing great ...making a killing there ...the rally has a ways to go too .... oil & gas beaten down and now coming back strong with rising prices .... ups will need to add surcharges ... on top of their price increases ... will be getting more expensive to ship .... which ultimately is not good for business.
Lowes sold off when Home Depot reported disappointing earnings and proved to be a great buying opp.UPS is not FDX. Same opportunity!
"Why is the price dropping today, we should be at least $200.00 a share. Maybe it’s because we paid a dividend today?"
"Looks like Amazon has a huge turnover issue, churning north of 30% of their insiders. And bigger issue with contract drivers. They’re trying to push more of their volume to UPS and Post Office but neither is biting. Will pose major service issues for Amazon. And I understand the churn at UPS is so far manageable, all hubs are producing, and peak hiring goals are being met. Should be a positive earnings report and peak season for the brown team."
"I see a lot of people are expecting UPS to fall on news regarding the Supply Chain Constraint, however, this actually benefits UPS. Supply Chain Constraints are impacting retail locations by reducing their reserves and products on shelves inevitably forcing consumers to shop online. UPS benefits from the uptick in Demand...They are also much better situated than FedEx who has been struggling to keep up with Demand. I think UPS has prepared for this better than FedEx, they stand to gain from this, not be hurt. Looking forward to tomorrow!"
JP Morgan just issued a slight downgrade ahead of our report scheduled for Tuesday 10/26 @ 9:30. They lowered us from $236 to $227. The most recent analyst release prior to Morgan's was by Evercore in late September with a 52 week target of $225 and an outperform rating. Those 2 are spot on with each other and not far from the $220 aggregate average of analysts as the 52 week target.
One of my only stocks down today. Price target is $196 by EOY.
Profits should continue to be good since they only raised the dividend a penny which allowed all those excess funds that normally would go to a dividend increase to be put to use running the business.
I want to explain more of my thoughts on how we can make bigger better as we have done for more than a hundred years. We have always had people that think “outside the box” looking for better ways to do things and it is always good to have them in all functions if possible. That’s where most ideas come from for growing the business and controlling our costs . Thinking outof the box includes finding related business that compliments the established parts and those that become extensions to our business including diversified business. We don’t need limits but should be open to anything that we can fit in that will assist our growth. Bigger is Better.Thanks for listening.
looks like i'm gonna have to pick up a stromboli today. it's gonna hurt . i suppose it will be easier if i heat it so it's softer. i just gotta be careful not to overheat it -i don't wanna burn my asp.
amazon now delivers more packages than fdx ...that is all i see now in my area is amazon delivery vans ... i used to see more of a mix ...
"FDX has essentially maintained their overall views from the analysts while at the same time the 52 week price targets have been lowered. Oddly enough, only 3 are under $300 led by our ""hero"", Ravi Shankar at Morgan Stanley who pegs them @ $250. At least 7 have targets of at least $300 and as high as $369. It would appear that these analysts are projecting a quick turnaround even as FDX offered a cloudy look into their future. It probably is a good time to buy FDX shares as they have been hammered and the forward P/E is approaching 10 while they trade at around $230. If UPS is able to beat on both revenue and EPS and have more clear going forward advice, it would be quite an accomplishment and should send a signal to analysts that we are managing quite well in a difficult environment."
