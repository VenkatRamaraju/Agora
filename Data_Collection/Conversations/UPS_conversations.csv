"There’s a different Rick out there bragging how he sold. Guy needs to grab a different handle. I, Rick, have not sold and will watch this stock fly through peak season. This other Rick wants to buy pack at $200. NOT!! Buy back now cuz next stop is 220’s!!"
"Here's a listing of the analyst upgrades since the report. I'll single out the magnanimous Ravi Shankar of Morgan Stanley for special recognition. It seems he's channeling the crime ""pre-cog"" characters from the Tom Cruise movie ""Minority Report"" to visualize the UPS share price collapse that only he sees. After much further reflection on Q3 results and an elevated going forward advice, he's spring-boarded his target price from $130 to $135. Sometimes I wonder if this is in $USD or not? Anyway, here's the rest of them: Stifel 224>241, Raymond James 240>260; Oppenheimer 222>230, Loop Capital 220->226; Keybanc 235>250; Deutsche Bank 237?253; CRFA 233>241. I'm sure there will be more to come."
"based on Q3 results, Q4 should be a blow-out of epic proportions ..."
if ups goes up tomorrow after the earnings announcement i'll pull a stromboli out of my asp ..
"One question; Who is the ""analyst"" at Morgan Stanley that valued UPS at $135? And have they been fired yet?"
"Now that we've broached the $202 level, here's another enticing thought to throw out there. I believe it was during the last earnings report (or maybe the prior one) where Tome hinted that good dividend news would be announced at year's end. After the thoughtful and reasonable at the time modest $.01 increase this year, perhaps we resume a more normal $.05-$.06 increase of recent years. Thinking that the vast majority of UPS employees are shareholders, that's would be a solid way of rewarding them for their peak season efforts during this and last year's extraordinary times. ."
"After the maintenance, UPS could rise to $245"
"Would have to say Tome is delivering on her promise. She has reduced debt by $6M with free cash flow and we can expect that to continue. We know that interest rates are on their way up at some point to counter this inflation. Expected profit taking going on now but I would expect a $230 price by year end if we can break through this $217 resistance level. Confident this will happen as a productive, smooth peak season unfolds this year."
"We can all agree that this was a fabulous 3rd quarter. Despite some tough weather conditions during the storm period, UPS performed on all cylinders. Giving solid going forward advice with a meaningful upgrade in margin expansion was huge. It's starting to look like UPS customers and share holders could consider FDX share price and service performance to be like shopping at Piggly Wiggly while by comparison UPS would be like heading over to Whole Foods. The ""better not bigger"" philosophy was once again proven to be prescient as domestic volume growth was down a bit but the margins were higher making it cost effective. With peak season around the corner and employees at a premium (Amazon in some areas paying a $3K sign on bonus and $18/hr), avoiding blow out volume keeps staffing costs under control and service levels high. FDX seems to have a meandering strategy to address those metrics."
"Looks like Amazon has a huge turnover issue, churning north of 30% of their insiders. And bigger issue with contract drivers. They’re trying to push more of their volume to UPS and Post Office but neither is biting. Will pose major service issues for Amazon. And I understand the churn at UPS is so far manageable, all hubs are producing, and peak hiring goals are being met. Should be a positive earnings report and peak season for the brown team."
Cramer said last week that he sold part of his UPS position because it had a nice run and was expecting a pull back. Since then its rallied another 20 bucks. Tonite's show he never mentioned this. He has convenient memory that always makes him look best.
"I can guarantee!!! That no matter how well UPS does on tomorrows call. There will be some obscure detail that will be credited for little or no gain over what you see today! However, I'm not complaining. I am still thrilled we have made the gains we have to date and can only pray that they can maintain!"
"If this quarter doesn’t solidify UPS’s comparative advantage over FedEx in the industry, I don’t know what else could. The extreme differences in performance paint the picture quite clearly. UPS, despite labor problems relating to higher costs, not only beat on earnings and revenue but they are continuing to widen the gap between FedEx and others. I’m expecting a nice run up past the 52 week high! Congrats to all!!!"
"Anyone think we get past $300 in the next 3 years? I’ve been here since ~$92 and am considering profit taking. I took profits in TGT at $119 and feel like I left too much on the table. Could UPS run a lot more, or are we toppy?"
"Was an owner of both UPS and FDX, but this week I dumped my FDX stake to buy more UPS. At the moment, UPS has less problems than FDX due to both its labor being unionized and also being more of a grounds transportation company than FDX. UPS may have a higher multiple than FDX, but the underlying business indicates the multiple is more than warranted. FDX has been mostly a headache for me to own for the last few years. I also think the current UPS CEO is a rock star. Firmly believe that by trading my FDX shares for more UPS that my money will thank me. In fact it has already begun to due to today’s blockbuster quarter."
"I see a lot of people are expecting UPS to fall on news regarding the Supply Chain Constraint, however, this actually benefits UPS. Supply Chain Constraints are impacting retail locations by reducing their reserves and products on shelves inevitably forcing consumers to shop online. UPS benefits from the uptick in Demand...They are also much better situated than FedEx who has been struggling to keep up with Demand. I think UPS has prepared for this better than FedEx, they stand to gain from this, not be hurt. Looking forward to tomorrow!"
my shares in companies that have not navigated the supply chain issues have taken some good hits. i think those supply chain issues will ease next year some time ... it is a temporary phenomenon. so it is an opportunity to acquire more shares at a discount. energy is still cheap. select retail will do well this holiday with folks out and about. financials have positive headwinds with interest rates rising. ups got its pop .... a decent one ...i don't know how it could get any better ... hopefully it holds onto its gains ..
"A lot of people seem to be fairly bearish on this board. Please feel free to start a conversation as i’d love to hear everyone’s input, but I believe it may actually be the opposite case. With the Global Supply Chain Crisis in play, retailers have no reserves. Shortages are hitting companies all over the country. People cannot buy items in stores, forcing people to turn to alternatives such as online shopping. I would think this translates to a higher demand for UPS and their services, correct???"
"We have a lot of investors that have no idea what a bargain UPS is right now. Record profits, tons of recommendations from analysts, soon to be a big boost in dividend in early 2022. Get in while its CHEAP!!!!!!!!"
"$23 bucks separate UPS and FDX, UPS closing the gap"
