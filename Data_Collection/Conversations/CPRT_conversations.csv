"How does this stock go higher and higher when their service is so poor, like no one cares who works for them. It's just a paycheck. All the cars I get from them are not what is in the pictures, many buyers like myself are not renewing memberships. I don't get it, who is buying the cars? I'm shorting at $150 something smells fishy, if you ever deal with Copart they do so many messed up things to customers. I don't get it."
Heres a chance to buy the dip!
"Really like copart, new investor looking for stocks for the long term... thinking of buying soon? Could the stock price grow if held for long? What’s a good entry point?"
"I have been doing business with copart for almost 20 years now as a buyer. This company does not care about their buyers; I would say their second biggest customer after the insurance company. The have pretty much monetized their relationship with buyers and care less about addressing their issues or concerns. I would see this company doing well in the short run as a result but by no means this will a viable long term investment. The amount of buyer dissatisfaction with copart is probably at its highest, which will eventually cost the company really dollars. Let us buyers share our experiences in this form to see if we can deliver a message to copart because member services for sure don’t care."
"Long 730 shares of CPRT at $104.26. This is a Pure Earnings play, bought my shares just a few hours ago, to hold through earnings release. Expecting a very good ER and an accompanying pop to the upside in stock price. I think $110 is very reasonable, but I am open for more. :-) Stock popped up before I got in, so not really happy with my fill price, but stock is trading up a little here in the AH session as we wait for the ER, which is due just before 6:00 PM ET. Best Wishes to All. :-)"
Last week I indicated this would pull back to the $86-$90 range! Here we are and looks like time to pick some up!
"Good earnings. Expected though to be trading at the insane multiple it trades at. No dividend. No cash returned to investors, no stock buybacks announced. Nothing. Just insider sales. I don’t see a reason to own it as the pandemic helped them and this is fluff."
Someone wanted to scary shareholders after hours but earnings are very good and the future is bright so there is no reason to sell at these low premarket prices

"I started a very small position today based on CPRT being the only game in town.And they are very abusive IMO towards purchasers. Their ability to add on fee's is impressive, these folks could have a future as a gov't agency!CPRT is basically up 70% basically in a straight line this Year. At this time of Year I mostly buy tax loss Company's not winners.However I did add a little WTR today also.Very slow MB here at CPRT. And never anything positive about dealing with these folks. So I thought I'd try and profit from that."
met earnings ...slight miss on revenue.....good report
"I listened to the investor call, They have done very well to bring in buyers to bid on the insurance inventory. They keep raising the buyer fees and increase in their inventory from both insurance and others. about an 80% of inventory from insurance. Their most important customer is the insurance companies since they supply them with the inventory."
What's going on with earnings?
Great company not a proponent of selling if you’re going long however don’t buy into the earnings which will nosedive. Reason; people are driving and therefore not wrecking cars insurance claim counts fell off a cliff. This is great for the insurance companies however horrible for Copart.Without automobile accidents they can’t collect fees on storage and they can’t auction cars if nobody’s buying.

Weird sell off what’s this about?
"My next Pure Earnings play is going to be CPRT to the Long side. Sometime tomorrow I plan to sell all my DVN shares. I certainly hope at a profit, and immediately jump into CPRT, to hold through earnings release Thursday AH. I think CPRT is a very interesting, successful, and well-managed company. Analysts seem to think there is limited upside potential from current price levels, but I tend to disagree. I think a very good ER tomorrow, could easily lift this stock to the $110 level. Here is my analysis and reasoning for choosing this one as my Pure Earnings Play of the Day:CPRT: Very likely to beat consensus on both EPS and Revenue. Company is enjoying very good revenue growth that should continue through this quarter and the next. Company beat both EPS and Revenue consensus for the past 3 quarters. Excellent stock price reactions to its ER's: Only ONE significant Gap Down in their past ELEVEN ER's. Stock is close to a 52 week high right now, but a comprehensive examination of valuation indicates the stock is still fairly valued right now. i see no over-valuation, therefore the stock should respond well and go up, on a very good ER, which is what I am strongly expecting. To add to this likelihood, a comprehensive analysis of overall financials, indicates the company to be in very good shape. Debt-to-Equity ratio is very good, Gross Margin is good, Operating Margin is excellent. Return-on-Equity is excellent, and Growth Rate is good/very good. To conclude, this play seems to offer an excellent risk/reward ratio, with very good odds of success, a 4-7% upside move seems perfectly reasonable. Other plays I strongly considered for this date include FIVN Long, and MOS and MCS Short Sells. Warning: You could easily lose 10-30% of your capital on any Pure Earnings play, and so I do not recommend any such plays to anyone, except to myself, since I am my own best leader and follower. Do your own Due Diligence and don't do trades like this unless you feel comfortable risking a 30% capital loss in a single day. Best Wishes!"
Great earnings report!
"CPRT gets very little love—or any attention, for that matter—on this message board. Yet it performs well."
I am a recent new holder of CPRT. a nice jump up in price based on the good report. I like this.
