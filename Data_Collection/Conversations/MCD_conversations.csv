MCD is down $11 since earnings gs. I guess the latest $4 plunge is related to masks requirements. Down $11 after stellar earnings gs seems like a buy to me.
Inflation means higher profits for MCD! Higher VOLUMES!
We made an institutional mistake. This company is not an investment. The $MCD deal for 3 years is just that. A test. Vegans and Vegetarians will never eat at McDonald's.
If your long an MCD buy at thus price wait or wait for tomorrow little by little build your position on these dips if your playing the long game
"if MCD is such a great buy because the wall analysts think so then why do McDonald's insiders hold no stock ?Why did they not buy a boatload at the bottom last year when the stock had fallen below $124 ?One possible reason is they ruined MCD's Balance sheet so that the book value because of the $50B debt pile MCD's book value is minus $9.70My advice do your own research not rely on analysts like Deutsche bank and Goldman Sachs who have their own agenda . you should also pay more attention to Kiyosaki's warning this week , please check it out before you learn the hard way and lose a huge amount of money All that's holding MCD back from a similar collapse to March last year is heavier volume and it looks as if that has started to build from today's just under 5M shares"
"MCD to 250 : [1] Narso approval Oct 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties.[2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by Aug, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end.[3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by Aug 30th, and those results could be best in class.[4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously.[5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022.[6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus.[7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself.Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued here !!!!"
Two hot tips...1) Own MCD stock2) Never ever eat at MCD
Up 10% in 6 days?? They gettin bought out by Burger King or something?????
Any long timers here know why MCD has been increasing long term debt the last few years. I could understand during covid. But debt has been increasing substantially for like four or five years now. Just wondering why?
All price and stock upgrades today! More in next few days!
So we didn’t make it to $250 ( we did see ($247.05 today though ). If we beat revenue and earnings in the morning with good guidance for the rest of 2021 I expect to see $255 tomorrow .
Love mcd and costco !! Held forever
MCD the smart COVID proof restaurants given they all have drive-throughs! It will continue to take market share from dine in foods! One of the few enjoyable conveniences to be left!
Bought MCD when I was 23 for .50 a share 1988
going to 245
Why go down today ? Milkshakes are everything ?
"""McDonald’s, Others Weigh Closing Indoor Dining As Delta Variant Continues To Spread""Hahahahahaha. Company is working with the government to completely destroy MCD. Hahahahaha.... See ya at $100. SELL."
Impressive. 5 price target increases this morning: all buy ratingsRBC from $263 to $268Baird from $252 to $262Argus from $260 to $275Wedbush from $265 to $270Morgan Stanley from $259 to $266
"Sure would be nice to see this split 2 or 3 for one, and yes I know the value would remain the same but a lot cheaper to buy more shares at a lower price.."
Can this hit $400 in the near future?
MCD is a buy and hold and add stock.
The way I figure it you gotta eat in both good times and bad; I‘be been picking up a few extra shares these days. If we have a market correction I’ll buy even more! 
I think the stock will be 275 by December… We're still in a bit of an economic quandary￼. Supply chains are still messed up as are human resources￼. It's going to be another year to shake more turbulence out of the market
Great quarter. I was afraid the stock went up too much ahead of earnings. Next quarter revenue and EPS will be above 2019. Everything g extremely positive but last Monday we were at $226 and we went up $20 in 6 trading days. Now we are paying the price short term but the quarter was spectacular and I expect the stock to move to $250. Same situation as MSFT today. Great quarter but it had gone up a lot prior to the quarter.
CMG worth 20 million per restaurant vs MCD worth 3 million per storeGo CMG
Will see $250+ before ER . Who knows maybe a stock split announcement by next Friday too .
"One thing to consider about MCD is that as of April 2020, they own 30 billion dollars of real estate which cuts their price to earnings by 1/6th. Definitely a buyer after earnings tomorrow."
"me thinks the franchise owners are now stuck with a losing franchise, they never could keep their promises to their workers of doing better than the corp. we lost the matching 401 when new owners took over, mcd corp knew what they were doing. sorry"
"If it was such a great quarter,, why is the stock down 5+ points...Nothing I saw on the wires,,,profit taking?"
MCD NEW TARGET $305.00 .
Buy MCD stock on Monday thru Friday. Joking aside MCD is a gem of a stock to own. MCD has probably made more millionaires (both shareholders and restaurant owners) Good luck y'all.
What is Raymond's brother saying in those Jimmy Johns ads?
"Another challenging day for my MSOs... $GTBIF is the exception. Last night, I gave a presentation (via $ZM) at my monthly investor meeting. The topic: American Cannabis ...in short, I liken the prudent accumulation of certain names...$GTBIF $TCNNF $CURLF $CRLBF $CCHWF to accumulating $MCD common shares back when they were selling burgers for 15 pennies. It was well-received. I am of the mind that the short term trough is at the bottom. The members are split (so far) on that issue. The overall risk/reward, valuation, likely catalyst, opportunity cost are all favorable. I added shares to all names in my basket today. Averaging up on all except for Columbia. I'll share our price targets (combined average) when available. It'll be a month. gl2a."
What is up with down $8? Really? I understand the market is down 900 points and reopening trade is down. However MCD down $8? Well I added at $226.64.
How is covid a pandemic and heart disease is not? Our govt cares about our health enough to let us fatten ourselves up
"""McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and bottled drinks at 1,250 outlets after becoming the latest victim of the supply chain chaos.""Anything politicians can do to disrupt capitalism, they will. Keep the covid kool-aid farce going. (Thumbs down from the gen y-z crowd expected, with your no-science 3rd world education.)"
Rock and roll McDonald’s
"Bought MCD at 130/share last year during the market drop due to the COVID panic. I’m kicking myself for not buying much more at the time, as I knew it was cheap then. Regardless, I love this stock and it’s dividends!"

The Mcdonalds employees aren’t masked at my closest locations. Very Surprised. Is that normal?
