What is up with down $8? Really? I understand the market is down 900 points and reopening trade is down. However MCD down $8? Well I added at $226.64.
"Best mcd is in Paris hands down. IT'S the fastest,busiest and cleanest."
"Never thought I would buy MCD, $187.61, only 132 shares. Technology advancements to improve the brand still in place, one man's infidelity is irrelevant."
I get the feeling they’re earnings are going to come in higher than expected. Every time I go into McDonald’s it’s packed. They also are using more automated orders and cutting out employees.
"Just picked some of these up at 215. An iconic and strong brand. Sure, it might sink for while but there's no keeping it down. McDonalds will fly again! Until then, I'll just wait it out. I'm in it for the long-term."
"Bought in single digits, only 4 years have went, but now I'm up 135%! (not including divs!)"
Great quarter. I was afraid the stock went up too much ahead of earnings. Next quarter revenue and EPS will be above 2019. Everything g extremely positive but last Monday we were at $226 and we went up $20 in 6 trading days. Now we are paying the price short term but the quarter was spectacular and I expect the stock to move to $250. Same situation as MSFT today. Great quarter but it had gone up a lot prior to the quarter.
"I noticed that MCd revenue has been falling for the last 2 years , what is it ? I think more and more people are avoiding eating outside and especially fast food . In my opinion buy Walmart as it will benefit a lot from this trend. Avoid MCd for next few years until it can figure out how to grow revenue again ."
Bought MCD when I was 23 for .50 a share 1988
Not surprising that Yahoo News mentions nothing about the Afghanistan debacle on their news website! Unbelievable! Wonder why?
You know this company is in trouble when most of their managers can barely speak English....
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
Can McDonald's start getting those icecream machines clean more often. Lot of complaints about them.
I obviously made a big mistake when I bought yesterday at 155
When market tanked I told everyone buy MCD and DIS don’t back out. Doubled my money
How is covid a pandemic and heart disease is not? Our govt cares about our health enough to let us fatten ourselves up
"MCD many many years ago, at $42 if my memory serves me well, done very well long term."
"If it was such a great quarter,, why is the stock down 5+ points...Nothing I saw on the wires,,,profit taking?"
Drive thrus are emptier than they’ve ever been. Short!
"(Reuters) -McDonald's Corp, the world's largest burger chain, said on Friday that a data breach in South Korea and Taiwan has exposed some customer and employee information, making it the latest global company to be targeted by cybercriminals.The details of the breach in the two regions were the outcome of an investigation by external consultants following an unauthorized activity on the company's network.""While we were able to close off access quickly after identification, our investigation has determined that a small number of files were accessed, some of which contained personal data,"" McDonald's said in a statement.The company said it will take steps to notify regulators and customers listed in the files, which did not contain customer payment information.Recent breaches by cybercriminals on hospitals and global companies including meat processor JBS and Colonial Pipeline oil have disrupted operations for hours, leading to worries of supply shortages.Some companies have had to pay a ransom to gain control of their operations and restart production.McDonald's said it would use the findings from the investigation to identify ways to improve its security measures."
Don't listen to shorts or doubters. MCD is a solid company with a great future. can't wait for earnings this quarter.
The nearest Mcd is 4.4 miles from my front door. A perfect jogging distance in the morning.
When is the dividend?
Would probably be higher if the ice cream machine wasn't down.
"Just bought my first (small) McDonald's stake; 10 shares at $187.99.MCD's business is impressive. It's not really a restaurant; it's a supply chain, real estate, and branding company. I love how it has outsourced the messy, capital-intensive side of things to the franchisee. It's high-return and capital-light. Easterbrook did a good job, and his departure shows that the board is effective."
I'm telling my age. I bought 200 shares for $48.
All price and stock upgrades today! More in next few days!
Tomorrow 
French fries orders are zooming up fast.
"$200 is only 7.5% away, div hike of 15% for an added payday."
Two hot tips...1) Own MCD stock2) Never ever eat at MCD
I love MCD as a stock and a restaurant. Love the Whopper there
Oh I love Happy meal and their collectibles. Space Jam is such a great collection and I got 5 out of 12 collectibles for display in my office and I love them. Each with $4 food I purchased. I would build a mini Disney land with those collections someday. MCD I l'm Loving It.
Great buying opportunity
"This old fart shareholder (me) is up 577% on my MCD position. McDonalds was my first job. I seared and I I flipped burgers and made fries and fish fillet sandwiches at McDonalds in mid 1980s. I made $3.50 an hour, and told my mom to discontinued my allowance. I am glad to see McDonald's is still around. I also like In-and-out burgers. I go to the one near LAX... These two burger restaurants are still awesome!"
MCD is a buy and hold and add stock.
Will see $250+ before ER . Who knows maybe a stock split announcement by next Friday too .
"Another challenging day for my MSOs... $GTBIF is the exception. Last night, I gave a presentation (via $ZM) at my monthly investor meeting. The topic: American Cannabis ...in short, I liken the prudent accumulation of certain names...$GTBIF $TCNNF $CURLF $CRLBF $CCHWF to accumulating $MCD common shares back when they were selling burgers for 15 pennies. It was well-received. I am of the mind that the short term trough is at the bottom. The members are split (so far) on that issue. The overall risk/reward, valuation, likely catalyst, opportunity cost are all favorable. I added shares to all names in my basket today. Averaging up on all except for Columbia. I'll share our price targets (combined average) when available. It'll be a month. gl2a."
"After behaving like a stock that's chart looked like Cuomo's popularity ratings for months and months, MCD got a nice pop today. Wonder why."
"if MCD is such a great buy because the wall analysts think so then why do McDonald's insiders hold no stock ?Why did they not buy a boatload at the bottom last year when the stock had fallen below $124 ?One possible reason is they ruined MCD's Balance sheet so that the book value because of the $50B debt pile MCD's book value is minus $9.70My advice do your own research not rely on analysts like Deutsche bank and Goldman Sachs who have their own agenda . you should also pay more attention to Kiyosaki's warning this week , please check it out before you learn the hard way and lose a huge amount of money All that's holding MCD back from a similar collapse to March last year is heavier volume and it looks as if that has started to build from today's just under 5M shares"
If your long an MCD buy at thus price wait or wait for tomorrow little by little build your position on these dips if your playing the long game
The MACD and RSI tell me that we’re not touching that low low again for the day. I’m getting some 8/20 contracts and holding
going to 245
This company can't get out of its own way...zero pretax income growth over the past 3.5 years (2017 to LTM 6/30/21). Time to punt and buy a company with a bit of growth.
Closer and closer to $240.00
"I know someone who owns a fast food restaurant in DFW area where shelter in place was for a month or two. Said they broke a record in sales in May operating on drive thru only. I know things are looking bleak but fast food restaurants will thrive most will beat earnings by a lot, I wouldn’t panic sell McDonald’s"
Let it rest and come down to 230. Good long term buy. It will come down in the next couple of weeks.
"Did some corner of the envelope math: $SHAK restaurants are valued at around $12 million a unit (SHAK's market cap, divided by number of current units). For reference, $MCD per unit val is about $4 million. At the moment, $HABT has a per-unit market valuation of just $1.2 million per unit...one-tenth the valuation of #SHAK, and a quarter of McDonald's. Seems to me the upside is with $HABT and not $SHAK, strictly on how the market is valuing the respective companies on a per-unit/market cap basis."
The courts have confirmed that MCD is NOT a company that promotes racism !
"This was a $170.00 stock in January and now it is a $159.00 stock, The lines at all MCD are long and as much as I can see at the various locations very busy. Why then the big drop again today of over $2.00???"
$195 by end of week. Selling here is done. The board acted quickly and decisively.
I knew it would be a short time before MCD was >$200 again. Those lines wrapped around even during the worst of the virus..
The lines are still long at MCD where ever you go and most of them have been up-dated inside and out. They missed this 3rd quarter a small amount and now the whole bottom drops out because of one analyst view point. I believe the shorts are pushing this down. MCD is still the best fast food restaurant out there for the price and quality of food.
I think the stock will be 275 by December… We're still in a bit of an economic quandary￼. Supply chains are still messed up as are human resources￼. It's going to be another year to shake more turbulence out of the market
Zee $238 iz good ye?
"I've never looked at this stock before. I don't ever eat McDonald's either. Last night I was out with someone who wanted to it. The drive through was ~15 cars deep. Is this a good buy during the pandemic? Anecdotal evidence says, maybe?"
Analyst predicts $240-$242
Why do the mods keep deleting negative posts about McDonald’s? Seems like they’re sitting on a lot of shares....
"Wow, if we can hold or pass $208 today, I'm definitely getting a fruit/yogurt parfait.."
"Today I find out that Mc Donalds medium drinks are now about 20% smaller than they had been, for years. The good, they were probably too big to begin with, and are now truly a medium size, and its less high fructose corn syrup we ingest. The bad, they didn't lower prices, did they ? So if they didn't lower prices, for giving us less product, then they should see more profit in the future."
So we didn’t make it to $250 ( we did see ($247.05 today though ). If we beat revenue and earnings in the morning with good guidance for the rest of 2021 I expect to see $255 tomorrow .
Earnings were impressive. Look for upgrades
"I don't care about gender parity/p.c. stuff. I like dividends and a good balance sheet. We have enough laws on the books already. Please stick to burgers, fries and shakes. Thank you. - Pete"
What is a good entry point in MCD?
"Chipole has gained their customers but McDonald's is not. I passed a McDonald's on my way home. Because of its location, it had more crowds than other McDonald's and it is the first MCD re-opening the dining room. But I notice that there are rare customers in the past two or three months. People want to dine at casual dining restaurants once the restrictions are off."
"if people can live with big Mac at $5, they should be able live with $200 oil."
Back to the 220s. It’s the beginning of the end for Ronald McDonald....
"McD's operating expenses are going down, whilst operating income is going up. That's all the Info that I needed to add to my MCD position."
I'm in at $207.50. Upside potential is huge while downside risk is minimal.
Bought at the wrong time many months ago. But it put me in the green today. Thanks MCD. Will buy a burger today to celebrate :P
Worth a lotto call after looking at cmg
A thumbs up for better to buy before ER or thumbs down for better to buy after ER
Nice dividend raise at 15%!
LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY:Mr14 hours agoCONGRATS IF YOU GOT THE STOCK/CALLS DIRT CHEAP. Maybe we take out $160 tomorrow or next week. Easy money. NO FEAR of buying MCD cheaper.BOOM!
Long on MCD because I go there everyday for breakfast and it's always busy. Love the mobile app option and now they have delivery.
I had a Filet o Fish and 2 McChickens today. Stock price should be rocketing up.
"Had a crispy chicken sandwich yesterday, MCD has a winner, it was better than the last Chick-Filet sandwich I had. The cinnamon roll is also terrific. Now if they could go back to the coffee they had a few months ago I will return being a regular customer and maybe buy the stock again"
"And with the not frozen quarter pounder, which is very good, earnings will be very positive $$$$$"
My advanced Modigliani technical analysis is still indicating McDonald’s to 255

What is Raymond's brother saying in those Jimmy Johns ads?
MCD NEW TARGET $305.00 .
"One thing to consider about MCD is that as of April 2020, they own 30 billion dollars of real estate which cuts their price to earnings by 1/6th. Definitely a buyer after earnings tomorrow."
"MCDONALD STOCK HAS BEEN MANIPULATED FOR A LONG TIME, MAYBE IS OVER"
"Surprised they did not hike the dividend, not one cent?"
"MCD is a good stock to hold LONG.Can someone please tell me why MCD's debt is so high? Also, I don't think Beyond Meat burgers will be that popular with MCD fans."
Lol raising the pay to $15.00 won't change much. Now the grocery stores will just raise prices to get the extra money as they always do win pay raise happens.
Most probably won't even sell mcd at $240.00
"DIV increase decision should be imminent ... the last three increases were announced on Sept19, Sept20, Sept 21 with increases of 7.8, 14.9, and 7.5 percent"
Still eating more at CFA ... but loving MCD stock today !!
MCD and pizza joints are gaining in restaurant market share. The double barrel MCD drive-throughs are working brilliantly. MCD is agile and makes adjustments as to suite the situation.
"I might add a few shares if we drop to 200. I like the rock-solid yearly increasing div, decent yield, but MCD has been cheap with the DGR lately... I still have >50% gain since my last buy during the Covid-crash.."
"“Now Hiring” everywhere. All the fast fooders need help. Just visit their drive through line and you’ll see the need. Lobbies still closed and taking waaaaaay toooo long to get folks through the drive through too. MCDonalds ice cream machines always “broken” around 8pm every evening. Always “fixed” by lunchtime the next day. All locations.“Our ice cream machine is broken” is the excuse that they use for cleaning it. It’s a four hour process of bringing up to temperature for sterilization. They insist on doing this during every evening rush instead of waiting on late evening shift change or having a process to do it when demand for ice cream is down. Overnight or early a.m., right? I have thought that it was bad business for a long time to lie to the customer and miss the sale. Have noticed over the years that many stores do this. They should just advertise “shakes til 7:30 pm.” Never a problem with a late sundae. Always a problem with a shake."
"They just do fast food right ! Everyone strives to mimic MCD, It's the gold standard of fast food !"
"please explain, why MCD 2.5% down?"
Bought 500 shares @ $188.43 felt good to get in at this price IMO.
"Bought MCD at 130/share last year during the market drop due to the COVID panic. I’m kicking myself for not buying much more at the time, as I knew it was cheap then. Regardless, I love this stock and it’s dividends!"
"All longs, you have a reason to celebrate right now and rejoice. The good Lord, Jehovah God spoke to me today and shared with me that we are in for a very strong day tomorrow. The number that was spoken to me is we will be up $10 per share tomorrow and very likely at the open. He led me to share this news with all of you. I know some may heavily critique this, but I’m just a humble servant of the Lord obeying what He has told me. I honestly feel very humble that He bestowed this upon me. May God bless all of us tomorrow with bountiful riches. He has also led me to pledge publicly that I will donate 10% of my profit to those to need it a lot more than me. I have been lead to encourage all of you to do the same. Let’s make a significant difference in this world with all the money we will make tomorrow."
"For lunch today, I’m ordering a triple BigMac with an extra beef patty and bacon. SUPER sizing my fries and a full sugar coke because IM AN AMERICAN and as the lord as my witness I AM PROUD. "

"""McDonald’s, Others Weigh Closing Indoor Dining As Delta Variant Continues To Spread""Hahahahahaha. Company is working with the government to completely destroy MCD. Hahahahaha.... See ya at $100. SELL."
"Look like money is running to safe havens now. MCD and SBUX and I suspect investors see the writing on the wall, blow out spending, with little growth, so we have an inefficient economy that may rationalize at some point. MCD is offering a quality prodcut at a great price... how novel."
"When my son was growing up, I tried to teach him about investing. I would buy him a few shares of stock and let him watch the price growth and dividend reinvestments grow the value. In 2001, when he was 13 years old, he specifically requested McDonalds stock. Except for reinvesting the dividends, that was a one time purchase. In the 18 years since, including dividend reinvestments, he has a 759% profit. As of this past Friday. I just wish I had bought him more than 4 shares. The original $144 investment is now worth almost $1,250."
"I noticed this on the headline news section on the Schwab site this morning, 1/6/2021 - Barclays adjusts price target for McDonald's to $251 From $245, maintains overweight rating. I will be curious to see how the big three chicken sandwich release does on Feb. 24. I still believe a brioche bun would be more appealing than a buttered toasted potato roll and like the idea of the trio offered dry with the customer having the choice of several sauces instead. I’ve never been to Popeyes, I occasionally (2 or 3 times a year) go to Chick-fil-a and haven’t been to MCD in over a year. It should be interesting though to see the reviews and how they rank to one another. What are you guys buying? I’ve added some shares to my positions of KO, MSFT, MCD, BKH & DODIX the last few days. Good luck & great investing."
The Mcdonalds employees aren’t masked at my closest locations. Very Surprised. Is that normal?
"We ran a McD franchise for 20 years and turnover was $3.375m. If there is a queue, sales are being lost as people head off somewhere else. The US operation is poor compared to Europe, Australasia, and Japan. Note also that the biggest competitor to a McDonald's restaurant is another McDonald's"
MCD just released their comps..down to 22%! Which shouldn't be a surprise..
FWIW today - highest closing price ever .
MCD the smart COVID proof restaurants given they all have drive-throughs! It will continue to take market share from dine in foods! One of the few enjoyable conveniences to be left!
"Sell some MCD today at $176+ to raise cash, it's a great ER report. Good luck longs."
McDonalds is dying before our very eyes. It won’t exist in the next 5 years (or less). The chickens have come home to roost!
"McDonalds ranked last in fast food choices, Chick-Fil-A at number #1. I can’t believe Jack in the Box beat McDonald’s..."
Any thoughts why MCD has traded this poorly in June. We are way off the highs @$238. Lately we are stuck @$230 with the stock market doing well. It seems like a great re opening trade but keeps going down. Thoughts? Like the loyalty program and thought stock would be trading closer to the highs.
4Big Macs 2 large French fries and a small coke.
Sell sell sell!
Best French fries at McDonald’s . We all knew that for years
Mcd is crowded not enough seats. 26 people waiting for seats.
"me thinks the franchise owners are now stuck with a losing franchise, they never could keep their promises to their workers of doing better than the corp. we lost the matching 401 when new owners took over, mcd corp knew what they were doing. sorry"
If this breaks $190 it will start a short squeeze. The shorts are fighting hard at this price. Let’s go MCD!
"My reply to a about the dividend growth made me go back and look at my records.My first MCD lot was 3/10/2006 at 34.83 p/s. The first dividend on those shares was (annual at the time) 1.00 or a 2.87% yield on cost.Those same shares are paying a 5.16 dividend per year now, or a 14.81% yield on cost."
"who woulda thought I'd have over a double in the venerable Dow30 stalwart MCD, not counting divs, in <4 years? That's an Average gain of >18% annually! Just goes to show, you can't beat the originator and master of fast-food. With the best real-estate worldwide, and decades of increasing dividends... it's a keeper!"
CD Drive thru is busy and dine-in picking up. McDonald gradually getting up more customers as other fastfoods dine-in are still closed.
"Fake uptrend. School starts soon, so no more teenagers working the day shifts. McDonalds is already short on staff due to covid. Sell!"
"Lol, anyone else mess with yahoo’s sustainability rainbow yet? It gives a number but doesn’t seem to explain how they came to their hypothesis. Anyhoo, if you know how to work it respond and I’ll see it later. Thank you and good luck investing everyone."
If you worried about mcd closing Walmartstores don't. Truth is covid was just an excuse they used. Those stores wereclosing because the real culprit was thier leases . Mall owners wete having unreasonable High lease contracts and mcd said #=%/#$%$*% to those prices so they closed them.
From my understanding McDonalds stock lost value when the vaccine news came out and it was presumed that everything was going to open up and McDonald's drive thru business would suffer. With the second wave coming and lockdowns looming McDonald's should go back to being a pandemic winner.
Yesterday I wanted to grab some McD's on my way home from my brother's--about an hour and a half drive--but the first 3 McDonald's I came across had so many cars in their drive throughs that I had to simply leave. I ended up getting my order at the fourth McDonald's I found. Their sales have got to be going through the roof!
MCD are under-valued by 50% in this market condition:Target $400
Been holding MCD for several years now. It’s a stable in my retirement portfolio. I eat there 2-3x per week. Usually a BigMac and a Coke or breakfast. I’m lovin’ it...
Rock and roll McDonald’s
Many of the comments are about customers lining up around the building and I would think that this is also in other countries also. What I can not figure out is how MCD dropped almost 4% yesterday or over $8.25. Then see AMC go from $5.00 to over $20.00 along with some other stocks that look like they were ready to fold.

"MCD's revenue and net income are up year after year, consistently delivers sensible profits, and rewards shareholders with steam of dividends. MCD is one of my core holdings.

PM discount!!!!!
"once vaccine is available and confidence restored, people and their kids are going to STORM into McD. One happy meal and the addiction kicks on all over again. Its the all American craving. Buy! Buy! Buy!"
"The charts are indicating that MCD is oversold now , RSI at 28. This solid be a bounce back week. Back to 200 under 210, but may be affected by BYND earnings report. We'll see, stay long on this one, it will go back up. The market loves enduring name brands."

"Mcdonald’s Fans Cheer As The Restaurant Opens 15 Chains In UKhttps://www.sectorreports.com.au/landing-page/?symbol=MCDMcdonald’s Corp (NYSE:MCD) is trading above its Parabolic SAR of $168.116, thus the stock looks bullish. Earlier this month, when one of the most popular fast food chains of the world, Mcdonald’s announced that from May 13, restaurants will open, fans had no bounds to their joy. The restaurant chain opened 15 of its UK restaurants, but only for delivery and no dine-in.The restaurants re-opening comes with stringent measures of social distancing, which includes perspex screens, floor markings or employees in close quarters as well as temperature tests for the staff on arrival.The restaurant has re-opened with limited menu and isn’t serving its popular breakfast items. This is done to reduce the level of complexities arising in kitchen due to changing menus from one time of the day to another."

"Usually in the past, MCD retracts after the announcement whether good or bad as the overbought level have been reached."
How could MCD have more than 2.8b profit and Net Tangible Assets lose more than 1b per Qtr? owns too many debt?
"240 strongly rejected, going back down"
MCD is down $11 since earnings gs. I guess the latest $4 plunge is related to masks requirements. Down $11 after stellar earnings gs seems like a buy to me.
"I'm sorry guys, I bought this stock, that's why its gone down. I have a good talent for timing."
Inflation means higher profits for MCD! Higher VOLUMES!

The way I figure it you gotta eat in both good times and bad; I‘be been picking up a few extra shares these days. If we have a market correction I’ll buy even more! 
Why down? this is a gift...BUY THE DIP...
just wait until the shamrock shake and mc rib come back......to the moon!
Food is definitely getting much better and every McDonald’s is more busy every day; self ordering kiosks are great; good food at reasonable prices; this stock should go to 200
I am up 483% in my MCD investment. I flipped quarter pounders and fried chicken McNuggets at McDonalds when I turned 16. Good memories becoming financially self sufficient. God bless America!
Took the grandkids to McDonald’s today. Told them Papa owns the place—have all you want—-and up we go!!!
"Endless lines of cars at the drivethru 24/7. Non ending. Lunchtime - 40 to 60 cars at a time.btw.. once a month even I have to get a cheeseburger, fries and strawberry shake, oh well."
Should I buy one share and hold it for the rest of my life ?
Was way oversold. Now back above $235.00 with a dividend coming.
"I worked at McD as a teen in early 1980s. A great 1st job experience and fond memories. Been a long term shareholder. It's a good time to add MCD shares here IMO and collect a sensible dividend. Over the long run McDonald's stock should go up. It's hard to compute what their real estate holding is worth nowadays. It's a quick sensible meal at a decent price. As a travel abroad often, I am seeing McDonalds everywhere - Sweeden, Denmark, Normay, UK, Hong Kong,..."

This was an essential business- 90% of their business is drive thru anyway so no interruption because of COVID. This continues
Like I predicted no effect on the stock ; this is not chipotle; this is the premier food company and this stock will reach 200
"This is the best restaurant company and stock period. Huge economies of scale, food that is improving and getting close to excellent and nice renovation of their restaurants and big dividend"
McD’s trend of declining revenues is the elephant in the room most everyone ignores as profits and dividends have kept rising - somewhat fueled by borrowing to repurchase stock . Unless the revenue trend substantially reverses the “chicken nuggets “will eventually come home to roost . A declining revenue trend is NOT a mark of a thriving business .
yesssssss.. earnings look g8. :)
I'm betting McDonald's will be up considerably by end of day today... Best quarter in a decade. granted it's not a tech company so it's going to move a little slower. But for a long-term hold with consistent earnings and a dividend close to 3% this is definitely a keeper in my IRA. Buy on any pullbacks.
We have been in a slump the past few weeks. Time for some upward movement.
"Where gut health and immune strength is based largely on whole grains and vegetable in the diet, why has MCD eliminated all salads from their menu during a pandemic when immune function could use a boost? They once had a delicious Asian salad plus other main dish varieties, plus side salads and were proud of these offerings."
Up 10% in 6 days?? They gettin bought out by Burger King or something?????
"Sell-off is overdone. McDonald's is now projected to see its Q1 earnings surge by 14.29%, based on the latest Zacks Consensus Estimate. McDonald’s is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 9% over the next three to five years. Looks like a buy to me"
"These stocks and bond ETF are good buys in my opinion - MCD, JNJ, and ABT. I also invest in VTI and BND for long term buy and hold. These holdings also allow me to spit out dividends as needed to cover living expenses. Good luck y'all. ps, I am an old fart and not a huge risk taker. I hope to make a decent ROI and invest mostly in American companies. Things are tough for some of my family members and friends. I hope to be able to help them out a little. So glad we're making progress on vaccine front. May God continue to bless America."
Buy MCD stock on Monday thru Friday. Joking aside MCD is a gem of a stock to own. MCD has probably made more millionaires (both shareholders and restaurant owners) Good luck y'all.
"Quarterly Report beat expectations on revenue, earnings, and both US and same store sales increases. Complete beat. Surprised the stock is up so little, but there have been several companies that have beat expectations and their stock goes down."
"MCD is a very attractive stock at this level. It’s sad what’s happening to the local one off restaurants in this country but a lot of them aren’t coming back. This market share will spread to the companies that survive, MCD etc. I see McDonalds gaining share in the coming years and most likely a $250 price in the next yr or so."
"I have owned mcd stock for 25 years...stopped at a small pocket mcds store travelling thru new jersey...it had not been updated in many many years....but what i was really shocked at was the size of the hamburger patties on the big mac...they were hardly thicker than 1/8 inch...really....together they would have made a normal size patty...as i drove back home thru the state i stopped at a wendy's....clean ,modern and the dave's single was delicious....i'm now worried about the future of my 600 shares.....has anyone else noted the size of the hamburger patties ?....they are going to lose customers....like me"
"""McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and bottled drinks at 1,250 outlets after becoming the latest victim of the supply chain chaos.""Anything politicians can do to disrupt capitalism, they will. Keep the covid kool-aid farce going. (Thumbs down from the gen y-z crowd expected, with your no-science 3rd world education.)"
Jeff Bezo with $179 Billion net worth could own all of mcd and still have $3 Billion Dollars plus left.
"Consider: MCD owns, or exclusively leases to per square feet, the most trafficked real estate in nearly every country on earth..."
"Employee on night shift at the window quits! Sign left at a broken drive up! I hate this job and I'm quitting!In the write up on yahoo this AM..so far McDonald's has nothing to say...but in the last part paragraph theythe company states they are hiring and the new wage at low entry stat will be paid between 11.00 up to 17.00!This is one of the biggest mistakes businesses in the food industry are making. When you have employeesmaking less and have been working for a company in the food industry for over 10 years or more with thechance to get any raise equal to a new low level hire, why would you want to go to work at that pay?This is what Sprouts has done to its longtime employees. This is something we all need to address. I donot blame the guy quitting a window job at this company. I'm sure his pay scale was lower than the newhires will be! This is one of the hiring problems with the food industry today. People have to quit then waita certain amount of time before they can get rehired at the new pay scale like the new hires do and will getpay raise's to boot! This is crazy nuts!"
"Just think if all McDonalds had fully working ice cream machines, their revenues would have be even better!"
Dividend coming!!!
"My $8K investment is now worth $42K, am keeping my MCD shares but will start taking dividend payouts to buy some stuff. So glad I bought MCD and reinvested the Divs."
Every where you go MCD has lines backed up around the building and for some reason MCD stock has not benn climbing like I think it should be. PFE is another one in the same boat!!
"The old investors who never worked in fast food (especially in this era) are clueless about this company and what actually goes on in their restaurants.In my estimations, McDonalds is extremely overvalued...."

"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?"
"As I drove home tonight from a hotel party, I passed by 7 or 8 McDonald's over a 30 mile distance. Every single one of them had drive through lines that wrapped around the building! McD's is rakin' in the bucks. Great time to buy...next ER should be a blow out, and the stock should get up to $255."
Those $226.50 shares almost up $2.00
With MCD firing on all cylinders and earnings looking positive MCD just raised their dividend to $5.00 I sure would like to see this do a split so more young people can get into this really great company. The price at this level puts a large group of young people out of the picture with the per share above $200.00
too sad for the shorts
This is becoming a serious buy. Do you think the kids next door are going to stop eating MCD because the CEO has a girlfriend? When the dust settles this will bounce right back.
Drive-thru restaurants like MCD is doing exceptionally well. MCD is best positioned for this pandemic scenario. One queue splits into two ordering queues. Just Brilliant!
"A post from Goodroc who is a McDonald's franchisee discussing how he faced Covid 19 crisis:I own and operate McDonald’s franchises in NYC. Although many do not understand the franchise model, i work on extremely low margins,30% of my revenue is paid to my employees total labor costs. For those standing on a soap box about our pay, which is $15 an hour to start everyone of my general managers and superviors began at min wage and they all now make between from 60k to 150k depending on their tenure , performance and the sales in the restaurants they run.i have a total of 1200 employees combination Both full and part time.My revenue is down 40% and my manhattan locations are down over 60%. Although we have cut hours we have not laid or anyone as we are trying to stay open for our staff , serve customers in need when in many cases it makes zero sense to continue operating.i have to make difficult decisions soon. If i do not manage this as well as possible and I do not survive this then all my employees are out of work.I am have major concerns regarding my ability to survive this crisis. I am not looking for anyone to feel bad for me but as an example of how devastating this crisis will be for our economy the economic impact is hard to fathom."
"The Fed has to pump the Dow to 35,200.00"
"CONSISTENT QUARTERLY DIVIDEND, And HUGE Upgrades by Analysts. NO Brainer."
...question to someone who has been a long time investor in MCD..Where do you see this stock price within 2 months?
Can this hit $400 in the near future?
I eat at least twice a week at McDonald’s; McDonald’s will always be here because they have a big moat offering reliable fairly priced food
A long tradition when MCD announced its earnings regardless good or bad earnings it always retrack. So must sell two days before earning report.
"SMART INVESTORS understand that MCD’s DIVIDEND is FREE MONEY.Who is going to turn away free money, especially in this current environment?"
This stock needs to split 3:1
MCD is a buy at $208...I wasn’t paying attention today and missed the beautiful buy!
Arbys says they have the meat in thier commercial. And then they show you french fries instead.lol
"I don’t have mcd shares, I came here just becoz I miss butter milk chicken burger! And fries! Ahhhhhh....."
MCD gets the okay to hit $240.00 today.
Is this thing ever going to break $300? $250?
"Grabbed a few shares @154 to start a position again. I sold the other shares on a down limit @200 a while back. Driving through a 3 state area, every MCD I saw had cars wrapped around the building in drive-thru. Even a few customers inside. MCD is a great port in a storm..."
"""McDonald's beats revenue estimates on U.S. drive-thru demand"" and from 226 now to 214 - solid short has done... I'm expecting it will close over opening price today :)"
Just wait till the dividend Reinvestment hits.
"Something does not add up - apart from the question about the quality/offering by what is in effect a fast food takeaway, Valuation PER OUTLET (pls don't call it Restaurant) is $9.6 Mio, this is insanity, Revs per outlet 2.15 Mio, that is in line with many restaurants, Net just 130k, also roughly in line, restaurants ARE NO GOLD MINE in the best of times, compare this to $MCD, McDonalds, that is bit problematic comparision as it is a franchise model, but still, val per outlet 3.6 Mio, highish but after all there is a strong franchise with long track record, sales per outlet basically a franchise fee, but net 150K, so not that different, so why is $CMG valued nearly 3 TIMES higher?"
250 before you know it.
Took my 3 grandkids to McDonald’s yesterday. Told them to oder all they wanted “Papa owns the place”
"AAPL MAKING ALL THAT MONEY. After earnings, raised their dividend to .82 cents per share/$3.28 annual. MCD’s dividend $1.25 per share/$5.00 annual.MCD trading in the $180s paying a higher dividend than AAPL trading in the $280s, and AAPL making a great deal more money.Not bashing AAPL, because I invest in AAPL as well. But MCD investors need to understand how good the company is to its investors. "
"A restaurant brand, A real estate Goliath, a leading technology company in its Feild, and much more. what's not to love?"
"I like McD and like what they are doing.However, considering this stock has always been in the dividend space, I'd like to see at least 3.5% payout but today it's more like 2.5%.I think the macro-economic weather is going to put a lid on this stock price, with US10Y finally breaching 3% yesterday and 2X more hikes coming this year, 3 more next.MCD investors out there, why do you hold this stock?"
"McD's is up as much as the utes today- when the market is falling, the divs keep calling.If the market totally collapsed, you would see Warren Buffett in McD's next morning having a $1 coffee..."
Love mcd and costco !! Held forever
"This quarter's earnings will suffer big decline because McDonald's close down hundreds of locations inside Wal-Mart. Those locations were the busiest among McDonald's stores. Also they lost the customers to casual dining which reopen their dining room this quarter. I think the earnings report will be bad, super bad. Don't know why people bid up share price before earnings. This is not Coke Cola which sells Coke to every restaurant."
"This will break out once the virus is controlled. Meanwhile, the dividend is an incentive to stay in it."
MCD is the GO To stock for a volatile market! Everyone still has to have big Mac n fries!!
We made an institutional mistake. This company is not an investment. The $MCD deal for 3 years is just that. A test. Vegans and Vegetarians will never eat at McDonald's.
Every day I am tempted to sell MCD but hesitate and it just keep going up. I just don't know how to call the top on the chart
Had to pinch off a few in a prudent trim @240.5. Valuation getting a bit ahead of itself....
"$CMG upgraded their loyalty program to win a 2021 $TSLA Model 3 and other prizes. $MCD launched its first-ever loyalty program, joining $QSR Popeyes and $YUM Taco Bell to make consumers spend more and gain insights on consumer behavior. Another way to compete! Good for consumers!"
"I'm still seeing MCD drive-thru lines that wrap around the restaurants. I've gotta believe they're going to blow away their EPS estimate of .47 come July 28th, when they report their earnings."

"Just imagine this, a regular quarter pounder and a 10 piece chicken nuggets cost $11.00, they can eat my asre. Not going to spend a dime at MCD. They are ripping people off ."
Does anyone think MCD is a good current buy for long term ? Wish I bought 6 months ago
Why the big drop after hours?
"It’s true I been by several so cal MCD on different days, long line in drive thru They are the perfect set up for this pandemic $200 7/28"
"After blowout quarter, McDonald's stock continues to get pounded. Most frustrating stock since Proctor and Gamble."
what just happened?
"MCD to 250 : [1] Narso approval Oct 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties.[2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by Aug, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end.[3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by Aug 30th, and those results could be best in class.[4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously.[5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022.[6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus.[7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself.Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued here !!!!"
I have held this stock for 24 years and will continue holding
Does anyone else think this weakness could be about selling defensive stocks to raise cash for investment in high growth now that some sort of trade deal has been reached?
why is their stock so high. In MI only drive up service in many rest. and food is not that great. Everybody buying coffee?
Any long timers here know why MCD has been increasing long term debt the last few years. I could understand during covid. But debt has been increasing substantially for like four or five years now. Just wondering why?
Back to 200!
Here’s something customers may not know: the managers use customer receipts to fill out fake surveys. Talk about professionalism....
