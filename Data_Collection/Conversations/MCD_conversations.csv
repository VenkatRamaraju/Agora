"MCD LOOKING GOOD! ALSO, BROS CONTINUES HIGHER!"
"5 year monthly beta = .6so, the dividend is trumped by the downside?was around $200 per share, but CV19 relatedstill $51B debt"
Will Mcds ever split? I have worked for them since 1983 and had 50.00 come out every check to purchase stock I've made quite a bit over 30 years.
"Congrats to the longs! McDonalds is an iconic brand that just about always beats, and if something isn’t working they figure it out and adjust quickly.Great results, love their coffee and it’s time to celebrate with another egg McMuffin!Long term hold and continue to collect and reinvest the tasty dividends."
Go McDonald's !!!!!
how is tesla 10 times more expensive than McDonald's

There will be no pullback in the market until Nasdaq hits new high + 200 points.
5 to 10% up after earning
"Issues - Labor costs, food costs, transportation costs, store opening delays (material shortages), CO2 cost, competition from re-opening of neighborhood restaurants - and inelastic pricing. Smart money has been selling into every Dow rally. Major correction coming soon when earnings and projections are announced this month."
Higher volume alweys welcome when price of stock goes up. Mash capitol gains as well as an increase in dividents add up to reasons for BUY AND HOLD. 
"This post will be deleted, but...FYI.....Janet Yellen is proposing to tax unrealized capital gains. That's right. Tax you on stock gains you have that you haven't sold yet for a gain. Yep......you heard it right."
"CNBC a moment ago. MCD is going to test Beyond meat patties in￼, ready for it? Eight stores! Beyond is up 1.33%. Can’t make this stuff up."
I think this stock will either drop 10-15% or pop 5%. The only possible moves on earnings in this market
BROS continues to rise.

huge beat in my opinion
"WEN, growing revenue and earnings,excellent food. Buying opportunity!"
Probably pop 4 or 5 points tonight. Assume decent earnings?
Only good thing about this stock is the dividend
"Over the past six months, I've noticed the McDonald's drive-through lines are constantly packed, wrapping around the building, whereas the Burger King, Wendy's, and others are almost always empty. McDonald's is definitely doing something right and it'll be reflected in their ER this Wednesday. Buy the dip!"
Yellen floating the idea of taxing UNREALIZED GAINS on stock positions.
Good day today
"too much debtinterest rates are up and going updividend is good, but created by debt?"
This is the type of stock I don’t care one bit going down……. So I can buy more
Expect 5% jump when mcd beats as burger king missed and still rose this am
What time is earnings
There’s nothing more American than McDonalds. Driving long distance on the highway and spotting the golden arches is a treat! Love their egg McMuff and black coffee. Spotting a MCD when traveling abroad is a great . Ps MCD was my first “real” job.
"I have $60K for long term,Can anyone from $t, $vz, $ko, $mcd, $tgt, $cost tell me why I should buy any among these and not on $tsla, $coin, $msft, $fb...etc and $aapl. pls no $pltr I do not need scam company that only benefits the CEO and his boys with unlimited insider's dilutions."
"my crystal ball246 run up pre earnings, the double top was formed at just under 250, 249.9 maybe240230 ?236240 becomes resistance230 sticks out like a sore thumb"
McD classic cup with handle on one month chart . Going much higher . Soon .
"What was that for a kind of spike down? Suddenly got a fill for a buy limit at .45 and the spike was all the way down to about 238.1. That is really rare, right?"
"By the amount of spam on the board, MCD is obviously doing well.Great earning today!"
"MCD had fairly modest growth prior to the covid assault. It seems they did very good selling food through the drive up window. The numbers are quite impressive. It might be that they got a lot of business that would have gone elsewhere. The numbers prove it, see last quarters financial report.https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/gwscorp/assets/investors/financial-information/earnings-release/Q2-21%20Earnings%20Release.pdfHowever, reality is their growth was moderate before, and the PE reflects that. Also their debt went berserk. In the meantime, the price may get pushed up, maybe a lot. They have done remarkably well though their entire history. They survived and flourished through Covid."
New all times high by end of the day Friday.
MCD one of the TOP performers in the US for decades.
I guess paying well above min wage didn't hurt them much.
"did this go down because it's entering the vegan market or something? I'm just trying to figure out the numbers, as all the vegan stocks went down today by a lot - got hammered."
240 close
"No matter how much I make in my life, I still love to get that Mc Rib when MCD release them. :)"
