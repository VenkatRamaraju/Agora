"I understand that the analysts information that Yahoo supplies is sketchy at best and worthless at worse, but when they say that two analysts rate it a strong buy and seven rate it a buy, no other ratings and there are eight of the analysts that provide a price target, the low being 295 and the high above 325. The price is now under 180 and looks to fall further, yet the question begs to be asked, if even only six of the seven who rated this stock as a buy have price targets above or even at 295, this should be a raging buy, or in this case a strong buy. So why haven't these analysts upgraded the stock to a strong buy??"
"Robert, you may want to see how the entire sector is performing before making that strong a statement. IPGP down as is NOVT after posting very good earnings report and guidance. I still see us in the 165 to 185 trading range, the earnings report just did not provide enough enthusiasm to get out of the current funk the stock is in. They will have to provide a strong beat to get this going again, or at a minimum we need to get a positive resolution to the trade tariffs."
"Well this may very well be the move we have been waiting for, does it hold above 185 through the week? If so, count me in, its for real."
"Francis, yes they were above expectations, guidance was good as well, though not as good as I had hoped. But again, ESIO is not the best business model out there. I think they do better with Research and Development, but they lack business acumen. This is something that Rofin excelled at, that is, making money out of their technology. I believe these numbers bode very well for us going into earnings, we should be up very nicely tomorrow. Hold on susan, things will get better. Good luck all."
"I think what you’re seeing with COHR today is a digestion of the news, especially with Apple’s report. The CEO of COHR said:From our vantage point, demand for OLED displays remains robust, but growth in the OLED share of the display market is being hindered by pricing and availability. This can only be corrected when one or more vendors becomes able to compete with the primary OLED display provider in the marketplace.Apple reported that demand for the iPhone X in China was better than ever, which signals a huge interest for OLED in China. It’s a known fact that Samsung has a monopoly in the OLED display business, but the Chinese are rushing to compete, especially BOE. The industry is trying to get in on the OLED action now. All this means that COHR will benefit from the competition.OLED’s earnings next week will be important. Keep an eye on it."
No slowdown or delays in the rumored news regarding their products. paid down debt and buying back 100m dollars of their stock....YES!!
"Unfortunately, it is impossible to justify the past several weeks, regardless of the value based on OLED based laser sales. Firstly, that overall is a small sector, secondly, one always has to look at the overall sector and as I have said multiple times we have a P/E of 22, IPGP has a P/E of 38, our earnings per share is over 7 dollars. Again, none of this is in jeopardy."
"First, the merger gap between IIVI and COHR will be filled upOn calculation IIVI $70 = COHR $283, still undervalued"
"Very little tradable stock in COHR. Institutions hold 95.6% of ~ 24M total shares, so how can 3.5M shares be traded? Stock should be $210+ assuming merger so why would institutions sell today?"
The gap is being filled; calling for faith and patience.
"Benjo, you are right that it was a disaster, though whether it is related to Apple or not I am still very doubtful. Did Apple make a couple of historic mistakes, yes, pricing a phone over 1K being the first and then not having the best technology available as the screen which your cheaper priced competitors already had. Though to say that Coherent is priced based solely on OLED I think is a bit of a stretch though. Did the stock get way ahead of itself based on the hope that Apple would utilize OLED, sure, but that really would only have had a limited positive impact on the stock. To have lost 2/3's of the value of the stock in a matter of roughly eight months is pretty amazing. Amazing to the point that I think the majority of its meteoric rise was manipulation and the majority of its fall was manipulation. So throw out anything that has happened before, what is the proper valuation for this stock and possibly for any of its competitors. We hear many who claim that the P/E is meaningless, maybe from a strictly technical or momentum play, okay, but in the end, fundamentals and therefore a company's P/E dictate an appropriate price. I believe it may take awhile but I firmly believe based on the sector, this should have a P/E hoovering around 18 to 20, so by year end this should be close to 200. But is this the time to buy or do we wait and see how the market makers play the markets in the new year, that is the 64,000 dollar question."
I was able to purchase an odd lot at $229/share in after-hours extended session post earnings release. I do not see justification for an additional 8.1% decline after the earnings were released. It seems the move is consistent with selloffs following earnings releases in most technology companies as part of a corrective market action and less about fundamentals. Channel checks by COHR showed no indications of changes in product demand and are inline with current projections.
"New here why this drop, not any bad news , good earnings. What is hidden here. Market is up"
"Believe it or not the merger is mainly about developing a competitive (to IPGP) fiber laser (FL) business, which basically depends on diode lasers and complex fibers. COHR bought Rofin for that reason and that didn't do the job, although they probably improved their FL position. I looked at LITE's web site and there it was, involvement in the FL business with a partner, Amada. The military directed energy market will undoubtedly require very high power lasers, most likely FLs. So the synergies come from merging the devices that go into FLs, keeping the best ones and getting rid of the others. Otherwise, I don't see any overlap in the product lines."
"Coherent beats by $0.02, reports revs in-line; Board authorizes $100 mln buyback (249.14 -3.89) Reports Q1 (Dec) earnings of $3.54 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.02 better than the Capital IQ Consensus of $3.52; revenues rose 38.0% year/year to $477.6 mln vs the $474.21 mln Capital IQ Consensus. ""There has been a lot of turbulence in the display market over the last several weeks, raising investors' concerns about the timing and/or sustainability of the investment cycle. We conducted a channel check and the results indicated no current sign of customers seeking to delay or cancel deliveries of existing ELA systems. We also reviewed fab utilization rates and system installations and concluded that service revenues are in-line with our expectations. During the quarter, orders from semicap applications were strong for expansion of memory capacity. We received our first volume order for high-power fiber lasers from one of the largest Chinese machine tool manufacturers. We also saw a solid uptick in medical device manufacturing workstations,"" stated John Ambroseo, Coherent's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We were pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which enabled another #$%$75 million voluntary debt payment. We have now repaid approximately one third of the debt used to finance the Rofin transaction. In addition, as a result of our strong cash generation, our Board has approved a share repurchase authorization of up to $100 million."" from briefing."
"II-VI earning beat, check itEPS 0.88 vs 0.75 / Revenue 808M vs 782.94Msolid growth. hold tight"
"Jeffrey, Jianjun is absolutely correct, everyone and I mean everyone knows the value but as he adequately stated it doesn't matter. Figure out why that is and then we have something here, but no one else has been able to figure it out for over three months now. Good luck with trying to justify buying this stock based on fundamentals. Heck, they actually had to fabricate the numbers for ESIO to get its metrics to show better than COHR. ESIO is a company that was founded around the same time as COHR in Portland but has never made money, now all of a sudden its a rock star. At least in the case of NOVT, formerly now as the artist GSI Lumonics, it was also founded in that same time frame, but it was founded in Canada but later moved to the USA. They all have value, but in the case of NOVT they are at all time highs and still climbing in the case of ESIO they are down quite a bit from their 52 week highs but are climbing strong based on what I believe to be tweaked metrics. Then we have IPGP who are also bouncing around their 52 week highs which are also their all time highs. Now why would all of these competitors keep climbing while COHR just languishes at a fraction (1/2) of their all time highs? One could say that they climbed too fast and I could agree with that, but then you have to look at IPGP, we compare the two companies and COHR is worth every dime of 220 to 230 a share, yet we just languish. Find out why that is the case and you can make us all happy and you can become rich."
"Be very, very quiet, let's pretend we didn't mention the 185 level and maybe it will recover."
"The burning question for the day, if OLED posts blow out numbers after close, does that impact COHR or not. On the drop of OLED, we fell in unison, though OLED rallied up to earnings report by nearly 20%, we made a move but couldn't hold it. If OLED blows out numbers and we don't move, then I will have to throw in the towel until the next report."
"It did not surprise me that the new boy on the block, LITE tried to buy Coherent, though it did take me back a bit when MKSI jumped into the fray, mainly after buying ESI. They paid a huge premium for ESI at the time which was performing vastly worse than the overall sector, which was principally due to the fact there were suspicions that they were cooking their books base on revenues and sales and profits not really adding up. So more than likely they found out that they did get screwed over by the ESI acquisition so now they are merely doubling down on the laser sector to hid the lack of proper due diligence over ESI by buying Coherent at a much inflated price over what it was a month ago. Yet now that II-VI a company that is very conservative is joining the game really causes me to think that everyone in the sector has come to the realization that the only way to grow their business is to buy competitors. There is no organic growth left and that is a very dangerous game to find yourself in. I would have thought that all three of these companies would have known the debacle that the Coherent buy out of Rofin-Sinar was. The newly combined company was supposed to create tremendous growth and huge profits, the price soared to 300 dollars a share, but quarter after quarter the promised synergies never transpired and the stock price eventually plummeted to just around 80. It is simply amazing that shareholders of these companies are sitting idle for this behavior, it is simply destructive to their equity value. Coherent will not provide synergies, just as Rofin-Sinar never provided synergies to Coherent."
Please read the merger details! It clearly states every Coherent share gets $100 in cash and 1.185 shares of LITE. The COHR share should be $206 as of the close today per above.In the coming days COHR will be going up to catch up with the conversion and if LITE share recovers it will even move further up.LITE is undervalued and its chart shows significant upward momentum.Best to All
"Someone just sold, or bought, 100 November $140 puts @ $9.60 ($96K investment). Anyone have a guess which way?"
"ISM manufacturing number is reportedly too weak this morning, The purchasing manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 48.3% last monthIt was below economists’ expectations of 49.1%. A number below 50% represents a contraction in the industry. Stocks will head down at the end of today due to ISM too weak number... indicating a recession on the horizon..."
COHR is now trading at 16x next years ave. earning estimate of $18 in earnings. High estimates are $20. Thats 14x. Seems that all we need is for COHR to show that this is still a multi year build out . If they do this should be a $400-$500 stock. Thoughts?
MKSI is offering~ $3/share more than LITE. Let the bidding begin!
"I'm expecting it to go down with earnings no matter what, but on the other hand i'm not confortable shorting it either. The technicals are a bit ambivalent. On the fundamentals side, with the $COHR merger it has the potential to become a behemoth in the sector. I suppose buying and forgetting for 5-10 years would prove to be rewarding. On a shorter timeframe, considering the price paid, debt, macro outlook with potential taper tantrum for end of 2021 beginning of 2022, who knows."
"From: Nicholas Rossolillo (TMFnrossolillo)Sep 23, 2020 at 11:47AMThe better buy is?While demand from communications end-markets may be headed for a rough patch in the next few quarters, the stress being put on the internet and organizations' networks due to the pandemic should keep longer-term demand for photonics headed north. And new uses for Lumentum's and II-VI's components in industrial and consumer devices are creating additional fast-growing end-markets for these two manufacturers. I'm not currently a buyer of either of these stocks given the immediate-term uncertainty, but Lumentum's better profit margins, stronger financial position, and relative value mean it gets my nod as the better buy of the two."
"Avg. Price Target $294.00, 61% Avg EPS Growth, 50% Avg Revenue Growth. Forward PE is only 9.5.This stock should be trading around $240 - $250 and would still be a bargain. Upside potential is hugh and downside is pretty limited."
Way Oversold. Shorts cover on the horizon. Earnings approaching. Moving UP sharply.
"Tomorrow will be the day to review where the price is and where it will be. We have ESIO reporting earnings after close today, they have guided upwards. ESIO is probably the weakest of the semicon laser manufacturers out there, they haven't made a yearly profit in a long time if ever. When I followed GSIG (formerly GSI Lumonics and now NOVT) in 2000 and beyond, Rofin was the king, GSIG was an also ran though ESIO seemed to gather all of the attention. I never remembered seeing or hearing about COHR, though they were very specific to the Silcon Valley so I guess they were more of a boutique laser shop. Needless to say, when COHR bought out Rofin, that definitely solidified their position in the sector. I believe tomorrow we see major upside after ESIO numbers are in tonight. People in the know are trying to drive price to create good entry points, anticipating big numbers. These numbers will not be impacted by Apple X phone sales, compare the surface area of a 6 inch phone to the surface area of a 50 inch television. In totality, the sheer volume of OLED end product will not be substantially impacted one way or the other by Apple or any of the phone manufacturers."
"susan, sorry about not responding but I try and not look at it anymore. I still believe there is a lot of upper current manipulation going on in the sector. 4Homie is correct that the ""reason"" that the market pundits give is because of Apple's poor reception with their X iPhone the first Apple iPhone with an OLED screen. But let us review the past several days and please explain to me why all of the laser stocks to include IPGP, NOVT and ESIO are getting pounded as well as OLED which fortunately I dumped at 160 for profit suspecting that they would continue to attack the sector. Yet during all of this carnage, the company who actually created the product that caused all of this tumultuous trading is doing just fine. Apple's market cap is pushing new all time highs, the logic doesn't play out. Anytime that logic does not work, it is an indication that the market is manipulated. Yes, it hurts everyday I look at the price and it isn't making a comeback, but I think it is just a matter of time."
"I'm not ready to concede that Benjo is a stock guru, though he has been proven to a point to be correct, though as the old adage states a dead clock is right twice a day, if you continue to say that the bottom will correct in every interview then eventually you will be proven correct, as many of the supposed geniuses who came out after the housing bubble. With that said, Benjo is proving right today, but the greater question is why, whether you buy into the chartist mentality or not, there is only so much that can be attributed to the momentum play scenario. Even the stock that created the initial fall has begun to recover and never got hit any where near as hard as the downstream suppliers, that being Apple. Because Apple charged too much for the X phone and now they didn't buy as many OLED screens from OLED and then OLED wouldn't buy as many Excimer lasers from COHR, therefore OLED is cut in half from its highs and COHR is cut by over 40% from its highs. Well why is it that Apple has only fallen about 10% from its highs? They were the company that made the mistake, not OLED or COHR. Then we had the new fall out from Facebook because they sold customer information, wow, what a surprise but that fall out destroys the tech sector yet again, yet now today we see FB stock price up while OLED and COHR still being hammered. I know I will get the usual ""the markets are perfect so manipulation is just conspiracy theory"" retorts but that is exactly what is going on here. The small investors bought into COHR and OLED and well ahead of the big funds who really wanted to focus on the FANG stocks and Tesla, then they realized that COHR and OLED were two of the highest returning stocks of 2017 and well that just didn't sit well with them, they were going to tank the stocks and then they were going to chase the small investors out and then buy into them and take them over and then drive them up. It is the exact game plan that they did with brick and mortar retailers. Amazon was going to run everyone out of business, now all of a sudden that is not the case and the big funds have run out the small investors and now have taken over the retail sector and now what a surprise, Amazon isn't that big of a threat after all and retail is beginning to soar again. Same story, different day."
"1. Stock repurchase for $250 million. 2. Revenue decline for 2019 is 8-12%, not 50-60% as share has declined. 3. The management has done an excellent job to deliver decent eps. The miss in eps in past two Q is actually very minor considering the adversity. It even beat for this Q. 4. The stock still has significant and enduring short selling interest. When are they going to cover?"
"Guys everything is fine with COHR... it’s a pretty volatile stock, this stuff happens. I’m buying more on this dip, it’s going to at least $350 most likely above $400 by the end of 2018"
July COHR will be at 210. Buying opportunity not going to last long. Great news coming on multiple fronts that will propel this stock to mid 200's.
"For the huge price swings, not a lot of volume, this is all over the place."
This stock will start going up steadily to 200 in a month or sooner.
"JLeons, micro LED does not use excimer laser for production. Is that fact or speculation on your part, is the technology transferable, I know quite a bit about the laser and semi-conductor technologies and I wouldn't say that."
I was waiting for this moment to jump in. Thank you sellers. You gave me the opportunity!!!
"The other interesting perspective is this, granted that COHR is currently the only laser manufacturer of the excimer laser which is used for OLED manufacturing, yet it actually is a small portion of the overall portfolio of the company and now we are getting hammered because of ""poor"" guidance by OLED, just one of many customers. Meanwhile ESIO, NOVT and IPGP are doing very well today, logic boys and girls and it isn't adding up."
