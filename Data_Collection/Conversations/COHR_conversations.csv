"Someone just sold, or bought, 100 November $140 puts @ $9.60 ($96K investment). Anyone have a guess which way?"
"Robert, you may want to see how the entire sector is performing before making that strong a statement. IPGP down as is NOVT after posting very good earnings report and guidance. I still see us in the 165 to 185 trading range, the earnings report just did not provide enough enthusiasm to get out of the current funk the stock is in. They will have to provide a strong beat to get this going again, or at a minimum we need to get a positive resolution to the trade tariffs."
"bruce, you run the risk of getting JLeons ire as he believes the markets are perfect and that manipulation doesn't exist. For everyone else, simply do a three month chart comparison of COHR, IPGP, NOVT and ESIO, also write down the trailing and the forward P/Es of all four companies. Then you see that IPGP is up 28% during this time, NOVT up double digits, ESIO up nearly 10% and COHR down over 18% during this time. Then if we look at P/Es COHR is by far the lowest even on trailing, which really doesn't even factor in the potential sales associated with OLED (front log as it is). So why is COHR who is by all rights the best in class and even Cramer admits that, I say that with a chuckle, trailing everyone else in their sector?"
Great company this is going up!
"While I'd rather own Lite-Cohr, there's much less chance for any anti-trust action in a IIVI-Cohr merger."
225 coming next.
"susan, yes this stock should always be sold, at a profit, patience Grasshopper, walk slowly on the rice paper and leave no prints, when you get to the end of your journey the lotus leaves will be yours for the picking."
"Looks to me like the Rofin acquisition was not worth it. High power CO2 is a declining business and Chinese are turning few-kW metal-cutting fiber lasers into a commodity, with government help. Can someone explan what ""ARM"" stands for? The CEO makes massive use of such 3-letter acronyms. This one seems to relate to a FL app that works for them. Maybe directed energy will be their next breakthrough but some of the big DOD firms must have their own massive programs. The best hope is the return of OLED-FPD fab orders."

Very quiet on this board. This company is well positioned for future growth and is “cheap” based on pe and other measures. I also own OLED and COHR will benefit from capacity build in next few years.
Coherent is the biggest company in laser industry. They have many new products on the way. They don't sell laser for only Apple application...
"I got into MTSI and FNSR at the wrong time and now Cohr at the wrong time selling 155 put with stock at 165 thinking the base line in the stock was pretty well set. Wrong about that with new dip in to 150 level. On the GS conference the CEO talked about pricing issues and said they would have more to say in July when they report. That is all you need to know. The algos jump on stuff like that and pound away until someone resets the balance with new info on volumes, markets and or price improvement commentary.GLTA"
"Guys everything is fine with COHR... it’s a pretty volatile stock, this stuff happens. I’m buying more on this dip, it’s going to at least $350 most likely above $400 by the end of 2018"
Tested double bottom at 52 week lows and held up well. Thus should stabilize now and start moving up to 200+.
"It'was a horrible thing on 07/31 /19 just one day after COHR 's last E/R, I wouldn't hold before the e/r... it's too risky to hold today either...Thanks Hg for reminding me ...."
"George, the only ""bad"" news today is the same bad news that has been dogging the markets since Trump was elected. We have Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and the other analysts trying to tank the markets in hopes of tanking the economy. The analysts' comments from MS must be happening in a vacuum, didn't they see the jobs numbers last week? False narratives to promote both their financial goals (tank the markets to create generationally great buying opportunities for their big money clients) and their political objectives (elect a Democrat as President in 2020). Nothing new there, same old, same old."
"With deeply missed ESP and bad guidance, it could go down to below $140.00 again as seen in the past e/rs....Caution ahead by tomorrow..."
"Only few investors in this board...that's why no ones interest in it, as it's a stay away stock if don't want to loose a lot of money."
what the .... is happening? no negative news. this is why so many people believe the stock market is rigged. Only the insiders truly profit. And yet this is legal? No different than attys...legal theives.
July COHR will be at 210. Buying opportunity not going to last long. Great news coming on multiple fronts that will propel this stock to mid 200's.
"I don't give strong sell recommendations, but I'll make an exception here - SELL COHR! See Micron's (MU) earnings release where they guided lower on poor smartphone demand, particular at high-end (Apple), which means COHR won't be selling many OLED machines in 2019. Also, the Chinese are selling hard into the sub-2 KW fiber laser market where COHR plays. I expect an downward earnings announcement in a few weeks and the stock to reach $80 in that time. I wouldn't be surprised to see a $10 drop tomorrow."
"IIVI certainly had a very solid report, which in combination with COHR previous statements that they are running at near/full capacity on eximer lasers suggests that COHR will do well this quarter. I will be interested to see if they have anything to say about microLEDs, as I would guess that within 4-5 years they will start replacing AMOLEDs in phone screens due to their greater brightness, lower power usage and longer life (they are inorganic based as compared to AMOLEDs). If I were into shorting stocks and had a long time horizon, I would certainly consider shorting some of the high flying OLED stocks."
Rocket day
the bottom is in....time to buy the dip at open. no brainer. Thank you Paine Webber
"It is amazing how great a ho hum report sounds right now, no tanking of the stock."
closing of takeover comes in September (approx.)?
What do you think will happen if the $COHR acquisition fails? Will the price crash? Go up? Sideways? What would be the rationale ?
"Me too, sold all before market closed today !"
"This is a lost cause it cost me almost half my life's savingsDown 132,points"
"Looks like freefall until May 1. Then we'll learn if their channel check from last earnings call and the AMAT channel check are still holding water on OLED capacity buildout. If it's a flat quarter with unchanged guidance and order book, I'll be comfortable."
Long time holder since $100. Sold half position in the high 200s. The CEO needs to do something to support the stock. Sell out to IPGP if that is necessary. If this round trips he should be replaced.
I read in IBD that the sign of a great company is ROE of 17% or more.COHR ROE = 20.72%.COHR is a great company!BUY
I sold. You can call the bottom now. Thank me later. :)
"Benjo, thought you said this was going to 150 after earnings."
Today's WSJ story on BOE entering OLED screen production big-time around 2020 is likely good news for COHR's order book for 2019 if not earlier.
"Today will be the start of an even worst trend, the fashion sector is blowing numbers out of the water, the weakest sisters, Tapestry and Fossil had extremely good numbers, once Capri, Ralph Lauren, PVH and VFC come out with earnings it will be confirmation that the sector is leading a major move up, big money will start to dump technology and follow fashion and banking in a major sector swap as I have been predicting. Thought they would pump retail but it looks like fashion will be the leader."
"ISM manufacturing number is reportedly too weak this morning, The purchasing manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 48.3% last monthIt was below economists’ expectations of 49.1%. A number below 50% represents a contraction in the industry. Stocks will head down at the end of today due to ISM too weak number... indicating a recession on the horizon..."
"susan, hopefully you took JLeons and my comments to heart and held on to UNH. The market pundits are really pushing the false narratives with OLED and the debacle that is the X phone. Yet, surprisingly, Apple stock is just fine."
"Seriously, the selloff in Coherent seems excessive."
Traded half my shares (1000) for 20k shares of AMD yesterday. Took me an extra two weeks to make it happen but I'm happy with the way it did. Hopefully AMD will see 15-16 before mid to late OCT and I'll be back into COHR big time before earnings.
"I predict a new low, but then they will pour money in and run it up, just would be afraid to take the risk right now, not sure how hard they will drive it down before they start to manipulate it back up to the 150 - 160 range again, could potential drop below 100, but doubt it, definitely don't think we will ever see Benjo buying."
"The big money trying to shake the trees and get rid of the weak hands before earnings, so they can scoop up cheap shares."
"From -3% to +10%. I must say COHR, I’m impressed. Congrats."
"The RSI was at 26 when we dipped just under $160. I think we may have hit bottom, or at least I want to think that!My Best,John"
MKSI is offering~ $3/share more than LITE. Let the bidding begin!
"Remember, Mr. Trump always want market up, so there 'll be most likely good news next week for the market..."
"I understand that the analysts information that Yahoo supplies is sketchy at best and worthless at worse, but when they say that two analysts rate it a strong buy and seven rate it a buy, no other ratings and there are eight of the analysts that provide a price target, the low being 295 and the high above 325. The price is now under 180 and looks to fall further, yet the question begs to be asked, if even only six of the seven who rated this stock as a buy have price targets above or even at 295, this should be a raging buy, or in this case a strong buy. So why haven't these analysts upgraded the stock to a strong buy??"
whay COHR is down big today without news? Anyone knows something? Please share it.
"GOOD NEWS FOR THE MARKET AHEAD / TOMORROW !https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/major-wall-street-banks-are-telling-clients-to-be-ready-for-a-sudden-rip-higher-in-the-market.htmlMajor Wall Street banks are telling clients to be ready for a sudden rip higher in the marketPUBLISHED 39 MIN AGO UPDATED 27 MIN AGOKate Rooney@KR00NEY KEY POINTS• Two major banks highlighted the possibility of a rapid, surprise jump in the stock market known as a “melt-up,” driven by investors looking to get in on a positive momentum shift.• Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are both recommending call options that “can capture a melt-up without having to time a melt-down.” • “For investors worried they are under-exposed to a more bullish scenario, we think call options offer the best risk-adjusted way to add beta,” says Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Sheets."
"huge, not sure if that news is having any real impact, look at how OLED responded to that ""great news"". This just being driven back to 185 range before they tank it back to the 170 or lower range."
"Benjo, as much as the funds would love to make us believe there is so much more pain for the semi-con industry, the numbers just keep piling in, displaying that it is all fake news, Samsung smashed earnings but they ""flagged smart phone markets"", AMD smashed numbers as well. The reality is that semi-con is doing great regardless of what people are saying. Eventually the fundamentals will rule again and the tech sector minus the FANGs will explode as they never saw the beating that the rest of tech saw."
Last quarterly they announced $100m buyback...wonder how much they have bought back. also like to hear something from management...good news...if so....short squeeze would significantly pop shares up.
"Francis, yes they were above expectations, guidance was good as well, though not as good as I had hoped. But again, ESIO is not the best business model out there. I think they do better with Research and Development, but they lack business acumen. This is something that Rofin excelled at, that is, making money out of their technology. I believe these numbers bode very well for us going into earnings, we should be up very nicely tomorrow. Hold on susan, things will get better. Good luck all."
"Adoption of industry 4.0 is a major reason for high demand in metal cutting machine. Covid-19 accelerates the global demand further. Growth in automotive, aerospace, marine, building and construction industries created huge demand in superior precision laser cutting machines. That's the reason why LITE wants to buy coherent. Just do the math, if LITE is trading at $95, for each share you own, it is worth $216. Why are selling it at $202? In addition, Coherent just said its preliminary revenue for Q1 is expected to be in the range of between $325 and $327 million, vs $314 million analysts estimated."
"Most of COHR's sales are in Asia. Certainly a great deal in Korea, but also China. According to last quarterly CC a Chinese manufacturer provided their first VOLUME order for high-power fiber lasers! The current price drop may reflect the uncertainty in future China trade resulting from new U.S. policies"
"It may hit 225 in pre-market, but it will go up during the day tomorrow to finish green at 265, numbers are good, news is good."
"next resistance $185, we need to hold $176.5 tight."
"Benjo, how did you do yesterday on your one ETF call, oh that's right Bit Coin was up 15%, ouch that hurt."
"Obviously today 's very low / light volume, since no ones interest in holding as e/r is just 2 days ahead or it's too risky to hold...Best 's wait and see couple days after its e/r 11/05...."
"Does anyone have a clue about what triggered yesterday's steep -6% drop??? I've looked 'everywhere', and it's like it never even happened. Smaller drops can happen 'just because', but -6% implies that there was some trigger, some where. Anyone???"

"Plato, it's Bourbon tonight, ROKU up 10 dollars and OLED climbing fast on beats and good guidance."
"Universal Display: Fear Not, iPhone Will Go All-OLED Some Day, Says CowenShares of organic light-emitting diode technology maker Universal Display (OLED) are down $9.80, or 5%, at $179.55, amidst speculation Apple (AAPL) is not going as quickly into the technology as some might have expected.While the Street has been pre-occupied with whether sales growth is peaking for Apple's OLED-based iPhone X, a parallel discussion has been going on about how Apple will not use OLED in a new low-end model of the iPhone due this fall.As MacRumors’s Joe Rossignol wrote yesterday, widely watched Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities opined that Apple will discontinue the current iPhone X this fall, and that while introducing two new models of iPhone X, a normal one and a bigger one, it will add a non-OLED, LCD-based model as the lower-priced of the three new models.That, writes Cowen & Co.’s Robert Stone today, cast a pall of Universal's prospects, but he urges investors to keep the faith.Stone, who has an Outperform rating on Universal’s stock, and a $225 price target, argues Apple will eventually go all-in on OLED for iPhone:If Apple is planning an early update, it makes sense to cut back builds of version 1.0 now, but this is likely to last only for a couple of quarters. We expect one new LCD version, likely to maintain a range of prices and features, but expect the lineup to eventually become 100% AMOLED.Another thing that’s been worrying Universal investors, writes Stone, is a delay in the expansion in manufacturing of OLED at Samsung Electronics (005930KS), which is Universal’s biggest customer.Fear not, he writes, a delay is not a disaster, and other parties are moving ahead, such as LG Display (LPL):Samsung's A5 fab was originally expected to be quite large, potentially doubling the existing mobile capacity. The building is under construction, but near-term plans for equipment had been scaled back. Recent reports suggest that even this may be on hold for the time being. We believe this is a good thing, since overcapacity is one of the perennial risks in the display industry, and Samsung may want to observe the progress of others to pace its expansion. We have always expected Apple to seek second and even third sources for displays, as it did with LCD retina displays (Japan Display, LG Display and Sharp). Shares of LG Display rallied this week, despite weaker Q4 margins and net income, apparently because investors were focused on the announcement that E6 Gen 6 flexible capacity will start up in Q3. This was seen as an indicator that LGD will begin supplying some iPhone displays. We believe BOE is also in contention to supply Apple, and Universal Display announced an extended evaluation agreement with Sharp last night.So far, Universal stock is up 4.8% this year, lagging the Nasdaq's 7.6% rise. Last year, The stock is still up 182 over the last 12 months."
"Avg. Price Target $294.00, 61% Avg EPS Growth, 50% Avg Revenue Growth. Forward PE is only 9.5.This stock should be trading around $240 - $250 and would still be a bargain. Upside potential is hugh and downside is pretty limited."
"dennis, you got to get it out of your head that we are related to AAOI, we really aren't. Our competition is IPGP, NOVT and ESIO as well as other foreign based competitors who may provide more issues with the excimer in the short term."
Does anyone else think the coherent board of directors were out of touch with the value of the company. I mean jumping at the first offer? I sensed the lumentum deal was way undervalued. In fact someone like amat might be a player too. I think it can go up to 8B when it all over
"Numbers were good, ok on the top line being $490 million about a 3% beat, but an 8% beat on bottom line being $3.72. I guess guidance is the key."
"Coherent EPS beats by $0.31, beats on revenueAug. 4, 2020 4:21 PM ET|About: Coherent, Inc. (COHR)|By: Jignesh Mehta, SA News Editor Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 beats by $0.31; GAAP EPS of -$0.36 beats by $0.13.Revenue of $298.3M (-12.1% Y/Y) beats by $10.87M.Press Release"
"Unfortunately, it is impossible to justify the past several weeks, regardless of the value based on OLED based laser sales. Firstly, that overall is a small sector, secondly, one always has to look at the overall sector and as I have said multiple times we have a P/E of 22, IPGP has a P/E of 38, our earnings per share is over 7 dollars. Again, none of this is in jeopardy."
Nice close today
"Accounting change continues to impact. LGD a big customer of COHR bodes well for OLED. Also the hinting of jockeying for position among display makers to be supplier of record for certain smartphone launches in the fall. May not be all-OLED, but could be getting very close. $100MM stock buyback over next 12 months as opportunity presents itself. Some support for a floor briefly."
"susan, I think I was somewhat offended by the mature comment, I assume you were stressing the intelligent part, one of the problems with everyone writing or texting we lose the benefit of inflection. So again, I assume you stressed the intelligent and said the mature under your breathe. I still would like to see them do a three or four to one split though. I know it is a badge of honor now with Berkshire and the FANGs to have stock prices in the atmosphere but I still prefer the old days when they tried to keep the prices in the range that anyone might buy the stock."
"NO ONES WANT TO LOOSE -14% AFTER COHR 'S COMMING E/R ON tues 11/05/19...One very important thing I 's almost forgotten that on its last e/r on 07/30/19, COHR was down to $133.88 on 07/31/19 which represented a -14% down from $155.50 as of today peak !"
Does anybody know when earnings will be released￼ ??
"Close $177, like it or not"
Diversified growing stock with presence in 4 segments of laser industry should sell for 20x forward earnings vs less than 10 but OLED pessimism weighing on it. When Apple confirms expansion of OLED or MicroLED we will see the harvest. Less than 90 days to wait.
"Coherent -6% after revenue miss, Street-low targetJul. 31, 2019 11:54 AM ET|About: Coherent, Inc. (COHR)|By: Brandy Betz, SA News Editor Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR) falls 6.3% after yesterday's Q3 report met EPS estimates but missed on revenue.Goldman Sachs cuts its COHR target from $141 to the Street-low $128.Analyst Brian Lee notes that the in-line earnings estimate would've missed consensus except there was a lower-than-expected tax rate.The Q4 revenue guidance was ""well below"" estimates due to pressure in the materials processing end market."
this stock should be trading at $284 if my math is correct. factoring in the 220 from the merger plus .91 of iivi. I'll take the free money if nobody wants it
"Benjo, still doubt that as the false narrative is starting to exhibit itself in glowing colors. For months we have been bombarded with the idea that computer, smart devices, etc. sales were tanking and that CPU and GPU manufacturers were in BIG trouble, guess what in two days of earnings from both AMD and INTC, both companies had blow out numbers and huge guidance improvements, fake news. Soon it will be proven once again that the supposed demise of OLED was grossly premature and the world will be right again, it will just take more real earnings numbers. Of course now the fake news is attempting to create the false narrative that the auto industry is collapsing now, so some of the semis will be impacted to some degree until it is again disproven by auto sales numbers over 17 million, which will happen. So much market manipulation in play right now. Yes, JLeons, I know the markets are perfect."
"susan, volatility though is based on the index which you are comparing the stock too, remember that a stock can indeed have a negative beta as well. So the term volatility is really in my mind a misnomer it should be seen more in statistical terms as the correlation factor, though typically it can only range from -1.0 to +1.0 which as we know the beta can exceed one. In reality, the low beta is indicative of Coherent's recent lack luster performance only as the S&P over the sampling period is up much more than is Coherent over the same sampling time. Had you looked at the beta less than three months ago when our stock price was pushing 325, you would have more than likely seen a beta of nearly two as we had appreciated much faster than the overall S&P. You really have to be careful using beta coefficients to imply the overall volatility of a stock and impart a certain level of stability to it, the two are not synonyms. In the case of big pharma and utilities and even consumer staples, that holds true, but it depends on the sector."
Please read the merger details! It clearly states every Coherent share gets $100 in cash and 1.185 shares of LITE. The COHR share should be $206 as of the close today per above.In the coming days COHR will be going up to catch up with the conversion and if LITE share recovers it will even move further up.LITE is undervalued and its chart shows significant upward momentum.Best to All
"Robert, trust me, no one is giving Benjo ""too much credit"" he has imaginary price points for just about every stock that I follow and in most cases he is just dead wrong, he did get lucky with COHR though and you got to give the guy his due, for now."
"Benjo, you are right that it was a disaster, though whether it is related to Apple or not I am still very doubtful. Did Apple make a couple of historic mistakes, yes, pricing a phone over 1K being the first and then not having the best technology available as the screen which your cheaper priced competitors already had. Though to say that Coherent is priced based solely on OLED I think is a bit of a stretch though. Did the stock get way ahead of itself based on the hope that Apple would utilize OLED, sure, but that really would only have had a limited positive impact on the stock. To have lost 2/3's of the value of the stock in a matter of roughly eight months is pretty amazing. Amazing to the point that I think the majority of its meteoric rise was manipulation and the majority of its fall was manipulation. So throw out anything that has happened before, what is the proper valuation for this stock and possibly for any of its competitors. We hear many who claim that the P/E is meaningless, maybe from a strictly technical or momentum play, okay, but in the end, fundamentals and therefore a company's P/E dictate an appropriate price. I believe it may take awhile but I firmly believe based on the sector, this should have a P/E hoovering around 18 to 20, so by year end this should be close to 200. But is this the time to buy or do we wait and see how the market makers play the markets in the new year, that is the 64,000 dollar question."
The gap is being filled; calling for faith and patience.
"susan, sorry about not responding but I try and not look at it anymore. I still believe there is a lot of upper current manipulation going on in the sector. 4Homie is correct that the ""reason"" that the market pundits give is because of Apple's poor reception with their X iPhone the first Apple iPhone with an OLED screen. But let us review the past several days and please explain to me why all of the laser stocks to include IPGP, NOVT and ESIO are getting pounded as well as OLED which fortunately I dumped at 160 for profit suspecting that they would continue to attack the sector. Yet during all of this carnage, the company who actually created the product that caused all of this tumultuous trading is doing just fine. Apple's market cap is pushing new all time highs, the logic doesn't play out. Anytime that logic does not work, it is an indication that the market is manipulated. Yes, it hurts everyday I look at the price and it isn't making a comeback, but I think it is just a matter of time."
"Oop ! Something 's not right since ISM number is way below expectation which represented a weak economy in last 3 consecutive months or recession is on the way . This 's no good for the market today, just sold all my positions to secure my stock account, also nearby e/r of COHR is comming Tuesday 11/05 which 's too dangerous to hold..."
"The other interesting perspective is this, granted that COHR is currently the only laser manufacturer of the excimer laser which is used for OLED manufacturing, yet it actually is a small portion of the overall portfolio of the company and now we are getting hammered because of ""poor"" guidance by OLED, just one of many customers. Meanwhile ESIO, NOVT and IPGP are doing very well today, logic boys and girls and it isn't adding up."
"Ash, volumes are too low to be a real move based on any types of fundamental reasoning. This is the usual gaming of the stock, it will go back down, just setting up for the earnings call from OLED this evening."
To new highs . One upgrade away.
"Buy up here, $160s is the hard bottom, been tested again and again, held very strong. Coherent future is laser bright!"
"Be very, very quiet, let's pretend we didn't mention the 185 level and maybe it will recover."
Should this stock be sold?
could be under $180 by today / tomorrow at least or down more next days...be careful...don't play with this dangerous stock...chasers will definitely get burned hard later on with a lot of tears....
"tim, very wise, I think you were very fortunate in your timing, looks like they are going to drive the tech sector hard to the downside for awhile, wouldn't be surprised if they get this back to the 130 or even the 125 range again, it will take a bit of time though. They will have to do prior to any tech earnings numbers get out, I believe the entire sector will outperform expectations."
"From: Nicholas Rossolillo (TMFnrossolillo)Sep 23, 2020 at 11:47AMThe better buy is?While demand from communications end-markets may be headed for a rough patch in the next few quarters, the stress being put on the internet and organizations' networks due to the pandemic should keep longer-term demand for photonics headed north. And new uses for Lumentum's and II-VI's components in industrial and consumer devices are creating additional fast-growing end-markets for these two manufacturers. I'm not currently a buyer of either of these stocks given the immediate-term uncertainty, but Lumentum's better profit margins, stronger financial position, and relative value mean it gets my nod as the better buy of the two."

"Also, I feel that there is not much downside ahead. Believe that this is the bottom price."
"Added 800 shares now, good luck"
The Barclays downgrade and price target drop is ensuring this goes back to the 120's.
"Average revenue growth for FY19 vs. FY18 is 6.8%. Average analyst view on earnings for same period is 14%. Yet our forward PE is only 9.3%. Is the revenue estimate accurate? OLED recently announced lower next year revenue at annual shareholder meeting, BUT revenue took a 10-15% hit due to new revenue recognition. Still, their revenue would be slightly down to flat and CEO acknowledged 2018 is a year of digestion. It is very possible Coherent can announce 15% top line growth for FY19. I don’t think we will here this in July but do expect it in late Oct or early Nov. if this happens then game on as it will climb aggressively once the Forward PE starts to align with the earnings estimate."
ZACKS downgraded CORH to STRONG SELL....https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/COHR?q=COHR
No slowdown or delays in the rumored news regarding their products. paid down debt and buying back 100m dollars of their stock....YES!!
one morning in May we'll see UP 50 +
"This one is heading to 225$ very soon , don’t miss the train $$$$$"
"DavidV, just curious why you set a 205 price target, mainly since you said it was an easy 20% gainer by year end (which by the way I believe is grossly under selling the stock, I think it goes up 40 to 50% by year end). So will the additional three dollars per share, therefore an addition 15K, which I know is not insignificant really stop you from making a gain of 200K? That really isn't logical."
Way undervalued stock. Up it goes now.
"I think what you’re seeing with COHR today is a digestion of the news, especially with Apple’s report. The CEO of COHR said:From our vantage point, demand for OLED displays remains robust, but growth in the OLED share of the display market is being hindered by pricing and availability. This can only be corrected when one or more vendors becomes able to compete with the primary OLED display provider in the marketplace.Apple reported that demand for the iPhone X in China was better than ever, which signals a huge interest for OLED in China. It’s a known fact that Samsung has a monopoly in the OLED display business, but the Chinese are rushing to compete, especially BOE. The industry is trying to get in on the OLED action now. All this means that COHR will benefit from the competition.OLED’s earnings next week will be important. Keep an eye on it."
COHR is now trading at 16x next years ave. earning estimate of $18 in earnings. High estimates are $20. Thats 14x. Seems that all we need is for COHR to show that this is still a multi year build out . If they do this should be a $400-$500 stock. Thoughts?
"COHR has Avg earnings growth of 122%, revenue growth of 82%. Forward PE is only 16."
I'm sure you know this already but COHR is showcased as a Sector Leader week after week in Investor's Business Daily. It also appears in the IBD Top 50 week after week.
I was waiting for this moment to jump in. Thank you sellers. You gave me the opportunity!!!
"The other sign of a manipulated market is when you have random stocks based on no public news just go up one or two bucks while everything else is down five percent. Then the next day, they drop like a rock, again on no news and they tend to be stocks which are less followed. I noticed strange activity with two of our competitors, one who I own as well, NOVT and ESIO. The interesting thing is that NOVT was blowing up yesterday before I made the mistake of questioning why it wasn't dropping like a rock too, well about five minutes after making that statement, the stock went from up almost a 1.50 to being down by 2 dollars. I've seen very similar things in small cap trucking stocks and a few other sectors. Of course the wealthy need to make money every day, so they have to focus on certain stocks that they can easily and safely manipulate and then pull away and pick a new focus everyday while assisting in dropping the overall markets."
I see it going to 340 by earning date of 2/5/18.Just saying.
"Wow, unbelievable other people have finally figured it out, a stock climbs seven dollars a share on big volumes and then drops by the same amount the day after with weak volumes only to recover slightly after volume picks up. This happens often times two or three times a week. Always without news or some vaguely related news which is so dated that Ronald Reagan probably knew about it before he passed away, God bless his soul by the way. Also, by the way, the SEC could care less they are bought and sold for by the people manipulating this stock and the entire market, you need to look at what is happening to our government to see the shadow government and the dark government to understand how deep this really goes. If the FBI and the NSA are as corrupt as they have proven to be, how honest and upfront can the SEC be?"
"with nvda good earnings just announced, the market will rebound and cohr can see 225 tomorrow."
Anyone know what is going on with COHR earnings this quarter. Thought it was meant to be this week but not seen or heard anything
They said they were going to buy back 100M in stock this year. I hope they start soon.
"It's possible that one of the major defense contractors, or a large indrstrial firm with related products, will make a better offer than LITE."

"This stock 's been fully manipulated internally by the company,,,stay away !"
"Believe it or not the merger is mainly about developing a competitive (to IPGP) fiber laser (FL) business, which basically depends on diode lasers and complex fibers. COHR bought Rofin for that reason and that didn't do the job, although they probably improved their FL position. I looked at LITE's web site and there it was, involvement in the FL business with a partner, Amada. The military directed energy market will undoubtedly require very high power lasers, most likely FLs. So the synergies come from merging the devices that go into FLs, keeping the best ones and getting rid of the others. Otherwise, I don't see any overlap in the product lines."
"I'm old and couldn't understand Cramer.Someone asked him about Coherent and I'm not sure what he said. PLEASE, some help? I think he said _ _ Photonics? HELP???"
250 soon!!! BIG NEWS and ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING.
If this touches $205 I'm buying 5000 shares....easy 20% by EOY!
I think we'll see 145 by July
"Down to 155 again, IPGP pre-announced some less than stellar numbers."
"I’m in,super company, great start to laddering in on the upside to 300"
"First, the merger gap between IIVI and COHR will be filled upOn calculation IIVI $70 = COHR $283, still undervalued"
"This stock has really already paid its dues. This selling today is probably because it coexists in ETF's holding OLED. So, IMO, it will go back up next week."
"mac, glad for the ones who held but the underlying question and this goes for the entire tech sector with of course the glaring exception of the FANG stocks is what actually made it go down? Supposedly it was because of the shortfalls of the Apple X phone and their initial foray into OLED screens, it crashed both COHR and OLED. Then it was supposedly lower numbers from Samsun, even though they blew their numbers out of the water, then it was concerns about Chinese retaliation for trade tariffs. Well none of these fundamental issues have changed, so why are you up today, why were you down in the morning, why did it drop from 320 to almost half of that value while its biggest competitors only dropped 10 to 15% of their all time highs. The same question could be asked of MU and AMAT. What exactly changed that all of a sudden made these stocks so highly desirable that wasn't always true?"
"Longs, don't give up your dollars. This stock is redefining patience."
"The burning question for the day, if OLED posts blow out numbers after close, does that impact COHR or not. On the drop of OLED, we fell in unison, though OLED rallied up to earnings report by nearly 20%, we made a move but couldn't hold it. If OLED blows out numbers and we don't move, then I will have to throw in the towel until the next report."
Barclays and Stifel Nicholaus still maintain price targets over $300/share.
"JLeons, micro LED does not use excimer laser for production. Is that fact or speculation on your part, is the technology transferable, I know quite a bit about the laser and semi-conductor technologies and I wouldn't say that."
"If the stock rallies from here we have to acknowledge that Benjo is a stock trading genius. He predicted $179 several times and I mocked him when the stock rallied to about $230 after dropping to around $200, which he also predicted when the stock was around $280."
"It did not surprise me that the new boy on the block, LITE tried to buy Coherent, though it did take me back a bit when MKSI jumped into the fray, mainly after buying ESI. They paid a huge premium for ESI at the time which was performing vastly worse than the overall sector, which was principally due to the fact there were suspicions that they were cooking their books base on revenues and sales and profits not really adding up. So more than likely they found out that they did get screwed over by the ESI acquisition so now they are merely doubling down on the laser sector to hid the lack of proper due diligence over ESI by buying Coherent at a much inflated price over what it was a month ago. Yet now that II-VI a company that is very conservative is joining the game really causes me to think that everyone in the sector has come to the realization that the only way to grow their business is to buy competitors. There is no organic growth left and that is a very dangerous game to find yourself in. I would have thought that all three of these companies would have known the debacle that the Coherent buy out of Rofin-Sinar was. The newly combined company was supposed to create tremendous growth and huge profits, the price soared to 300 dollars a share, but quarter after quarter the promised synergies never transpired and the stock price eventually plummeted to just around 80. It is simply amazing that shareholders of these companies are sitting idle for this behavior, it is simply destructive to their equity value. Coherent will not provide synergies, just as Rofin-Sinar never provided synergies to Coherent."
Are sellers at this level thinking that 0.91 share of IIVI not worth $20 or the merger in jeopardy? incredible.
"glenn, not unusual activity given the very bloody two weeks that we have had so far and today on the Nasdaq was also very weak. It is the last opportunity for the big money to drive the price point down to create a great entry. It will start up tomorrow morning, pre and after markets mean very little to COHR day trading price."
"If you listened to conference call, very cautious guidance will be exceeded. Clear sandbagging here. Good luck all longs! If you’ve already sold, no sense in posting..."
"Good luck longs, but glad I moved to NOVT. Up 1.85 today."
"apl, I agree with your thesis that it is a screaming buy, I held the same thought from 278 all the way down to 155 only to give up and sell at 178 and took that money and reinvested in stocks that have already returned decent amounts of those losses. The question is all about timing. The same is true for OLED which I still own but have taken a similar beating for. How long are you willing to wait for this inefficient market to say that a company with a P/E half or even a quarter of its competitors who is also a technology driver in their sector to be equivalent to a IPGP, NOVT and/or ESIO? I bought in at 165 on Friday and sold at 168 yesterday, I only made a few hundred bucks but right now I think that is all we can do. I have lost faith and/or trust that this story will recover based on fundamentals alone. What more do they have to do to justify their price. The newbies or just the naïve say that management needs to come out and say something, well what should they say that the metrics and the analysts price targets don't already say?"
"COHR'S today technical number RSI is lowest (~ 26.00) since 01/09/2017,therefore it 'll rebounce HUGE from today !It's time to load more and more shares before too late !..."
Buy Buy bought
Today we are witnessing the blowoff bottom in Coherent. When you see crazy selling and 35% price corrections including one day 15% declines you have reached the final washout. Many companies getting whacked after earnings these days. I'm a buyer.
Glad that little birdie spoke to me and told me to stay away even though it had maintained the 185 level for a week. Still too much game playing going on with tech right now.
"With this much devastation in the stock price, I am surprised that we have not heard so much as a peep from company management. I would expect them to come out with either a reaffirmation of their outlook during the earnings report or to let us know if circumstances have changed."
Is it just me or is COHR severely undervalued?
"Is the order flow back on? Seems like the sector is moving. Longs, is this the next cycle turn? If so we could blink and the stock could move back over $200"
"I'm not ready to concede that Benjo is a stock guru, though he has been proven to a point to be correct, though as the old adage states a dead clock is right twice a day, if you continue to say that the bottom will correct in every interview then eventually you will be proven correct, as many of the supposed geniuses who came out after the housing bubble. With that said, Benjo is proving right today, but the greater question is why, whether you buy into the chartist mentality or not, there is only so much that can be attributed to the momentum play scenario. Even the stock that created the initial fall has begun to recover and never got hit any where near as hard as the downstream suppliers, that being Apple. Because Apple charged too much for the X phone and now they didn't buy as many OLED screens from OLED and then OLED wouldn't buy as many Excimer lasers from COHR, therefore OLED is cut in half from its highs and COHR is cut by over 40% from its highs. Well why is it that Apple has only fallen about 10% from its highs? They were the company that made the mistake, not OLED or COHR. Then we had the new fall out from Facebook because they sold customer information, wow, what a surprise but that fall out destroys the tech sector yet again, yet now today we see FB stock price up while OLED and COHR still being hammered. I know I will get the usual ""the markets are perfect so manipulation is just conspiracy theory"" retorts but that is exactly what is going on here. The small investors bought into COHR and OLED and well ahead of the big funds who really wanted to focus on the FANG stocks and Tesla, then they realized that COHR and OLED were two of the highest returning stocks of 2017 and well that just didn't sit well with them, they were going to tank the stocks and then they were going to chase the small investors out and then buy into them and take them over and then drive them up. It is the exact game plan that they did with brick and mortar retailers. Amazon was going to run everyone out of business, now all of a sudden that is not the case and the big funds have run out the small investors and now have taken over the retail sector and now what a surprise, Amazon isn't that big of a threat after all and retail is beginning to soar again. Same story, different day."
"I'm expecting it to go down with earnings no matter what, but on the other hand i'm not confortable shorting it either. The technicals are a bit ambivalent. On the fundamentals side, with the $COHR merger it has the potential to become a behemoth in the sector. I suppose buying and forgetting for 5-10 years would prove to be rewarding. On a shorter timeframe, considering the price paid, debt, macro outlook with potential taper tantrum for end of 2021 beginning of 2022, who knows."
"oc, if you check out OLED, they are getting hit today because of a report from Samsung that they have a current oversupply of OLED screens. So instead of having a one week supply they have a two week supply, okay, that means that instead of making a ton of money, they will make a ton of money minus a very little. This is typical false narratives being created to pressure stock prices anyway they can find a connection. For Pete's sake, when Tesla claimed that they were looking at creating a Drive-in restaurant model with charging stations the stock price for Sonic tanked. Then when Elon drove a gasoline powered model of their 'new"" semi design (which is completely conceptual and totally impractical due to the size and weight of the batteries needed to make it feasible for long hauls), the price of Cummins and Navistar tanked. Of course all three stocks were back to their original prices within two weeks. It is always about the big boys with the big money creating the false narrative to get the little guy to sell and then they work the price back up as they start to cash out with huge gains. Then they repeat. And then they repeat again, and so on."

This stock will start going up steadily to 200 in a month or sooner.
Get on board! This is being bought back steadily.
"Not a bad earnings from COHR. Might be down 2 or 3% tomorrow, but all in all looking pretty solid, especially considering you were up nearly 5% today."
Way Oversold. Shorts cover on the horizon. Earnings approaching. Moving UP sharply.
Rather amazed that there was absolutely no movement in price in AH.
Now we are headed in the right direction on a tough day
"Guys and gals, what happens when this hits 185 will be critical to its direction going forward. Remember May 29th, it tipped it after a dramatic gain and then once it hit it, they tanked it hard, so please be careful."
"wow, dropping hard on volume."
"Sad day, the only comments come from the pumpers and dumpers, this used to be a pretty good board, it was active and the posts were actually intelligent, non-pumped or non-dumped, just other investors opinion both of the company and the sector and the overall market trends. I am a bit surprised on what is a very good day that we only have George and T posting."
"Very little tradable stock in COHR. Institutions hold 95.6% of ~ 24M total shares, so how can 3.5M shares be traded? Stock should be $210+ assuming merger so why would institutions sell today?"
"I know I sound like a broken record but NOVT, ESIO and IPGP all up and somehow COHR is down and the NASDAQ is blowing up. Still waiting for someone to provide any logic to this so I could feel comfortable to invest again."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, Benjo, it will report in two days and the story will be ""how high will it go"". End of story. Anybody else tap out? If you can't afford to lose money in the market, you shouldn't be in the market. You just made the wealthy, wealthier and you just became poorer."
Be patient. Earnings will be great. Coherent has all the products and the markets well sized up. In fact they need more employees to fill the backlog of ordered products. Added new employees add overhead so they will wait a bit. In years past coherent said 4 th quarter was the best.
"Sellers almost done, buy the special price"

"Chuckles, very true, look at the recent history of analysts upgrades across industries. In retail and fashion, Ike with Wells upgraded Capri to strong buy with PT of 48, price spiked for one day to 38, it now trades at 27. He downgraded Signet to 12, stock was at 24 before downgrade, stock tanked to 20 after downgrade, after earnings report spiked to 32, now has dropped to 28 -29 range. Goldman downgraded Texas Roadhouse, twenty dollars ago, it is nearing all time highs, upgraded Chili's, which tanked and Outback which is flat, merely based on offering Grub Hub delivery. Analysts have been pumping Universal Display for awhile, now tanking. They were downgrading MU, AMAT for months on supposed inventory overstocks, price kept rising, now they are pumping the stocks, they are falling. Analysts are merely pawns of the 0.1% would own the markets and the brokerage houses. Markets are rigged."
"As I originally said yesterday, they will pump to 140 and then dump to 120."
"Rumour that Apple will be all OLED for iPhone in late 2019 (release of new iPhones is typically in Sept/Oct). UDC has a lock on ph-OLED emitters until at least 2022. Firms up COHR's order book, perhaps even adds to it if true."
"Wow, a long time since we saw 150...early October and it was dropping fast through the mark."
mann...this stock movement is perplexing...
Since they played the dump and pump game with IPGP on earnings do they do the same with COHR? Could we see the price drop big at the open after report and then climb dramatically during the day.
Patience is a virtue
"Mercury man, I not so concerned about the markets reaction to the Fed right now, I think everyone has pretty much factored in no changes, so a surprise drop would be a plus, no change means status quo, I think markets do okay. I do agree that tech will drop hard on no trade deal, not sure if rest of market will be impacted as hard as most sectors have not benefited from positive news on trade, Fed or economy for that matter. We see fashion, retail, trucking, and other consumer discretionary stocks hitting new fifty two weeks lows in those sectors almost daily. I still believe Coherent doesn't drop below 120. The way they pumped up OLED makes me wonder why this hasn't jumped more as well."
This is crazy... 30% drop on an amazing company.... in a few years this will be over 500-600 a share
Can II-VI back out at this point? Shareholders on both sides strongly approved the buyout. Is there a regulatory threat to the transaction? I don't remember there being a concern from regulators. If it doesn't go through is there a price II-VI pays? COHR paid over $200 million to LITE to take the II-VI deal. What's up?
i I remember Kramer few weeks ago was saying this was a Buy

I think the drop was due to comment Amat made that 2019 display business would be soft but more than offset by other increases
I was able to purchase an odd lot at $229/share in after-hours extended session post earnings release. I do not see justification for an additional 8.1% decline after the earnings were released. It seems the move is consistent with selloffs following earnings releases in most technology companies as part of a corrective market action and less about fundamentals. Channel checks by COHR showed no indications of changes in product demand and are inline with current projections.
"JLeons, you tell me whether this is good news? Do you know anything about the manufacturing process of the new Apple micro LED? Do you? We do know that they claim there will be much lower yields, if you are so adept at knowing the facts, what does that mean to you? Low yields means that mitigation activities need to be employed to attempt to raise those yields. Then again, I ask you, what increases yield on semicon products, whether wafers, sheets, etc.. They are called Lasers. The very same reason that OLED and the other manufacturers use the Coherent product line for OLEDs. They improve yield, therefore the companies make more money, not less. Please tell me oh wise one, why does this news imply bad news for Coherent? If one customer fails, then another succeeds. Net zero sum game, we sell Lasers, not OLEDs."
"Well this may very well be the move we have been waiting for, does it hold above 185 through the week? If so, count me in, its for real."
"1. Stock repurchase for $250 million. 2. Revenue decline for 2019 is 8-12%, not 50-60% as share has declined. 3. The management has done an excellent job to deliver decent eps. The miss in eps in past two Q is actually very minor considering the adversity. It even beat for this Q. 4. The stock still has significant and enduring short selling interest. When are they going to cover?"
"If I was short, I would be worried"
"It's great time to buy today, as RSI 's way too low / oversold already....Just loaded a lot of shares yesterday and today....."
"Jeffrey, Jianjun is absolutely correct, everyone and I mean everyone knows the value but as he adequately stated it doesn't matter. Figure out why that is and then we have something here, but no one else has been able to figure it out for over three months now. Good luck with trying to justify buying this stock based on fundamentals. Heck, they actually had to fabricate the numbers for ESIO to get its metrics to show better than COHR. ESIO is a company that was founded around the same time as COHR in Portland but has never made money, now all of a sudden its a rock star. At least in the case of NOVT, formerly now as the artist GSI Lumonics, it was also founded in that same time frame, but it was founded in Canada but later moved to the USA. They all have value, but in the case of NOVT they are at all time highs and still climbing in the case of ESIO they are down quite a bit from their 52 week highs but are climbing strong based on what I believe to be tweaked metrics. Then we have IPGP who are also bouncing around their 52 week highs which are also their all time highs. Now why would all of these competitors keep climbing while COHR just languishes at a fraction (1/2) of their all time highs? One could say that they climbed too fast and I could agree with that, but then you have to look at IPGP, we compare the two companies and COHR is worth every dime of 220 to 230 a share, yet we just languish. Find out why that is the case and you can make us all happy and you can become rich."
"I own COHR, IPGP, IIVI and OLED....I have much more of OLED than any of the others but am thinking of reshuffling my allocation and it looks like COHR is the cheapest (PEG .37, EV/EBITDA 15) I still love this space but want to protect profits....any thoughts?"
"This is what I am talking about. Without any previous indication, thy just announced their earning today. It does not say anything about Earning conference call. However the earnings for this quarter is good. No indication of how future quarters are looking. These guys really don't care about their retail Investors. They probably call the institutions and let them know. Very frustrating."
This is going to soar on Tuesday Buy here eod
"It 'll be soon back to $200 due to rate cuts on the way for sure next week and the rest of this year, also when US-China trade deal reached by beginning of July...."
"Look like COHR 's highest is $155.00 for now, since it expected on its e/r will be declined -72 %, if it's true so it could be overvalued and could be down to $140.00 or even lower later after its e/r..."
"Oh gosh, now Yahoo Finance is dragging out the old Yale and Harvard Economists to explain to us (lowly middle class investors who lack a real edjamacation) why a potential increase in interest rates of even one hundred basis points is justification for the huge drop in the markets to cover the fact that the markets are being manipulated for political purposes."
"Tomorrow will be the day to review where the price is and where it will be. We have ESIO reporting earnings after close today, they have guided upwards. ESIO is probably the weakest of the semicon laser manufacturers out there, they haven't made a yearly profit in a long time if ever. When I followed GSIG (formerly GSI Lumonics and now NOVT) in 2000 and beyond, Rofin was the king, GSIG was an also ran though ESIO seemed to gather all of the attention. I never remembered seeing or hearing about COHR, though they were very specific to the Silcon Valley so I guess they were more of a boutique laser shop. Needless to say, when COHR bought out Rofin, that definitely solidified their position in the sector. I believe tomorrow we see major upside after ESIO numbers are in tonight. People in the know are trying to drive price to create good entry points, anticipating big numbers. These numbers will not be impacted by Apple X phone sales, compare the surface area of a 6 inch phone to the surface area of a 50 inch television. In totality, the sheer volume of OLED end product will not be substantially impacted one way or the other by Apple or any of the phone manufacturers."
"Given that COHR has been beaten down so much, one has to go all the way back to March 9, 2017 when COHR was around $181/share and trending up (as opposed to trending down). It hit $205/share by March 27, 2017 - taking about 12 trading days. This suggests that COHR will likely hit $205/share by the end of the third week of August this year (Aug 17)."

Can all the wise investors pls share their opinion on why this stock hasn't rebounded like all the other stocks. Will we ever see it return to its high of 329...in my lifetime? I bought at 288 and have lost a ton of money like many I am sure. And I have noticed no one is posting comments anymore.
this stock is such a disappointment - im in this at 253......
Going to be down for the day. Glad I sold. Might buy back after earnings released.
"Insanity, the overall economy is much stronger now than a year ago, though I know many will talk about rising rates, inflation in general, concerns about trade, end of cycles with semis, etc., etc.. and the stock price was just breaching the 260 mark."
"Wow, who would of thought that Coherent would posts results and not one comment, very interesting, the days have changed."
"It seems COHR 's heading down to below $150 again today, due to weakness of the ISM number which 's being contracted in the whole last quarter / 3 months.."
Had to buy more to cost avg down.....100 shares at 214.47
"Well OLED had great numbers or so it appears unless there is some underlying spin that is put on them, so this should pop tomorrow. She could hit the 155 mark."
"II-VI earning beat, check itEPS 0.88 vs 0.75 / Revenue 808M vs 782.94Msolid growth. hold tight"
No worry. I will come back for sure. This is a good company.
"So now they have had to get the Wall Street journal involved to tell us that because Apple who hasn't sold many OLED screens because they lack the financial ability to price their phones accordingly are going to use OLEDs and continue to be outflanked by Android phones who do use them and are superior to Apple in too many ways to enumerate here. So they are trying to justify that OLED and COHR are down because a non-existent customer is still non-existent. So how do we justify the fact that our biggest competitor has a P/E that is still three times that of COHR, regardless of whether or not Apple or for that matter anybody else decides to start using OLED products. It pure manipulation."
"Rusty, low volume means people trying to drive price down to try and create opportunities, if there was real angst among the investors we would be seeing huge volumes."
"Found this:IPG Photonics (IPGP), Coherent (COHR) to Benefit Directly from Lithium Battery Growth, Snap-On (SNA) Indirectly - Northcoast Research"
Just thanks to Laura :-)
They should buy back 500K shares tomorrow
"It may take awhile, but it's goin' up!"
"Interview I read with new CEO was not very encouraging. He seemed to be focused on OLED fab laser systems. That was someone elses winner, what's he going to contribute? I get the feeling that the Rofin acquisition was a disaster and they are not competitive with IPGP in fiber lasers."
Urge all investors contactmanagementNumber below Legal counsel And or SecLet's get the short cons out of the stock
"One of the biggest strikes to COHR right now is their physical location in California, we may begin to see tax inversions based on the statehood of acquired companies rather than the country. With CA threatening to charge surtaxes on businesses to fund social programs this will lead to more businesses relocating. This makes the potential of another buy out all that much more likely. ESIO would be a likely candidate though they are in a border state who might impose similar anti-business taxes and of course my favorite NOVT who is on the other coast but also in a tax and spend state. Either way, I think Coherent as all CA companies need to begin to make exit plans to optimize the new federal corporate tax reforms that are now law."
"For the huge price swings, not a lot of volume, this is all over the place."
"Kinda quiet now...any thoughts, anybody?"
well had to add more at 288.50........
"I find it humorous the people on these boards who try and justify extreme price drops because of some fundamental shift in the market or otherwise logical explanation. One stated that OLEDs are still too expensive, really? Have you priced a large screen television yet (and yes I know our products are not to make television screens, simply making a point). So because Apple got greedy and priced a cell phone for over a thousand dollars and it didn't sell that completely changes the direction of the OLED market to include Coherent who in the end really only has a small exposure to any one market sector for lasers, they are probably the most diversified of any of the laser manufacturers. So using that philosophy, then the price of Tesla who makes 100K cars in a market where the average price of a vehicle is a third of that amount is at ridiculously high market cap and it is a company that loses billions of dollars, yet analysts say it is a world beater, and they know it may never make money. Now for Coherent and even Universal Display both companies just print money and will continue to do so well into the future and we're overpriced based on fundamentals. Ummm, don't buy it."

"George, currently nothing is in compliance with NASDAQ and I believe the more appropriate word would be correlation with. The MM's are still randomly ramping up some stocks while randomly dumping others. They will pump a stock in the morning to only tank it by noon only to pump it up again by close, we see wild and random swings based on no fundamentals, no stock relevant news, no macro-economic news, yet the people who are writing the scripts for how the stocks will perform everyday, create swings of 5% and sometimes as much as 10% within a single day. They tanked SWKS, only to blow it up when it reported really weak numbers, they tanked NVDA when it missed and rightfully so, yet every since the original report came out they have only driven the stock up, with no real news to imply anything different than what was reported in the CC. So does it really matter how a stock correlates right now? They have been driving IPGP ever since earnings and their numbers were very similar to COHR (relative percentages that is). The more random the movements, the more likely a stock is being manipulated by concerted efforts of MMs and/or hedge funds utilizing computerized trading selling back and forth to each other driving prices. I eager await the day when the SEC finally wakes up to the gross abuses of the big money funds and their use of technology to manipulate prices. The SEC simply needs to assign a unique issue number to each and every share of stock that is trade-able on the open market. Then they need to track how often the same share of stock is traded back and forth, if the same share is traded a hundred times in a day for instance, then that could be used as a metric to determine if colluding funds or managers are selling back and forth to each other to create the perception (which unfortunately is also the reality if you sell or buy while the stock is being played) that a stock is falling precipitously or climbing rapidly. Then individual investors could also see how many unique shares of stock have traded hands and then how many of the same shares were just sold back and forth."
"I dislike COHR management's lack of consideration for Shareholders. They don't bother to announce when the earnings will be announce. They do not comment on anything that is going on with the company. They act like they are privately held company. I will never again own this company, whether their buyout goes through or not. This is one of the worst companies I have ever owned. I am just so fruatrated with them!!"
The fundamentals of this stock are so strong that after in-line earnings and in-line guidance pps will pop. Shorts have had success and will cover for a profit and accelerate the spike. You heard it here first.
"Time to call the bottom for COHR; I cleared out at $169.58. (Nice having an up day when doing the deed, now watch how it performs over the next 30/60/90 days.)"
"T, not sure I agree with your bullishness, if I had stock still I would probably hold at these levels, but I see nothing to convince me to invest as I currently do not own. The tech sector is showing serious signs of weakness as it looks like the big money is doing a covert sector swap from tech into retail and more consumer discretionary stocks that have been badly beaten down in preparation for big run up going into the Christmas season. As much as the financial news media is driving home recession concerns, it gives them cover to drive those consumer sensitive stocks down in preparation. At some point though one has to ask the question - how do tech companies make money if the retailers who are selling the products with their components/products are in such dire straits? Furthermore, to enter into those sectors, they will have to sell off tech. The big drops in OLED and other high flying tech names is enough to convince me to stay on the side lines."
"Retested previous low around $160.50 back in April. Looks like a double bottom structure is forming with neck around $180. If we can hold this bottom, the future upside potential is significant."
"New here why this drop, not any bad news , good earnings. What is hidden here. Market is up"
What is going on today? Sell off like this doesn't bode well for earnings later.
CEO “Our outlook for 2018 is unchanged; we expect it to be a record setting year. New integration and expansion plans remain on track...”Either you think the CEO is lying or you think the current share price is dislocated from reality.
Every thing in the sector is moving nice hope good day for us
"If COHR mgmt is correct that 2019 is to them what 2018 has been to OLED, then it's a ride back down to the $90s."
"Rev guidance is inline : 470 - 490 M.No “direct” EPS guidance but data to calculate it, but my note taking not fast enough and will have to wait for transcript (or better someone else to post).They debunked the “iPhone X portends OLED downtrend “ BS MULTIPLE times saying they see NO slowdown in their customer demand.Stock will start to rise and get to new high as the overall market volatility “noise” subsides"
Industry news is about competition and declining prices. Is cohr profit significantly affected by competition ?
