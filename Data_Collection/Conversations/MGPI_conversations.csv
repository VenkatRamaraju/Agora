What's going on? Down 10%
I believe it's getting added to the s&p 600 index.that will surely help
"‘We are currently conducting additional analysis to better understand the aged whiskey market, and, going forward, we will continue to refine our strategies and tactics to improve the sales predictability and management of this important piece of our business.‘Great idea Gus....Have another glass or three..."
Eps to be 10% off & stock is down 28%??? What kind of b.s. is that? U know it’ll recover slowly like GRUB & PRTY
"With 73.7% institutional ownership and 29.29% short interest, this stock currently reports at 117% stock ownership. It just beat earnings estimates by over 100%. How in the world is there not more retail interest in this stock, and how is it possible this has not become a massive short squeeze? Not trying to cause one, just trying to learn. Thank you in advance for any insight provided."
MGP Ingredients is up 6.36% to 38.95
Bought this POS stock at $48. Lots of it too. Hating life...
why?????
This is company is doing well. Moving into the beverage alcohol has been a good move. Beer consumption is going down. Current price range seems to make sense.
"MGPI just dropped 5.5% in after hours?!? Looks like a big spike sell off! Let me guess, that largest share owner woman sold off 14 days before Earnings Call because she KNOWS something we don’t— The Fix Is In!Such a scam."
What happen Ah drop 10%
"Darling Ingredients beats earnings by 50% and rises 5.3%. MGPI beats earnings by 100% and the stock falls, despite a rising price target. Again, if anyone in the shadows has knowledge, please drop it on me. Because for the life of me, I cannot understand why price performance on this stock in this sector is not better."
MGPI is a solid company. Another company that may become the future Anheuser-Busch for Cannabis Breweries and infused craft beers is BBRW or BrewBilt as they have successfully developed a state-of-the-art CBD pharmaceutical grade extraction system. BBRW trades at under a penny but the stock is about to take off.
Buying
Way oversold.
MGPI is up 5.34% to 84.26
The new 1.1% MGP dividend article says that MGP bought .9% of their shares back this year. Where is that documented?
MGP Ingredients is up 5.22% to 64.09
"It seems absorption of LUXCO, the competitor and diversifying outward with their own products as well as quickly rectifying a few unsettling events that became oddly newsworthy has payed off... MGPI is in a unique position in that they are the largest providers of this kind of food and alcohol based product, have been doing it forever as leader in the space, and there seems to be an ever growing need for the products that they do provide!!! Whew! That was a mouthful... but all true. Not sure what there is left to keep this coiled spring down. Congrats to us Longs... your time is Now. "
"Well well! Whadda ya know? This looks like a chance to”Buy the dip”. Strong numbers, despite current environment. It seems to be the market had priced in the report. Though, i am confident in their growth and long term outlook."
MGP Ingredients reached a 52 Week high at 68.62
Up 2 % premkt. Very nice. Told u not to worry
"Is it possible to see another significant price drop at earnings call time in a matter of days? OR, did the dip already happen with the recent drop and pre earnings call info being shared a few weeks ago. Sounds to me like earnings call can't really say anything we don't already know at this point. Interested in buying but not sure exactly when. Anyone have thoughts on this??"
"no reason to fall,it will bounce back tomorrow.."
"Why the -7% drop??? I see nothing on line to suggest such a major problem. Emailed the company for answers this morning. Irritated, to put it mildly..."
I went in for 500 shares at 38.46
"This 'little known' food-additive outfit in Atchison, Kansas is an amazing find; up 76% for the port here over a very short 12 months. One of my top three performers. Looking to add when I see a pullback of ~~~5.5%... it doesn't happen often, so I might well be waiting a while..."
Really low average volume on this stock. Looks like 98% of shares are held by institutions? Thinking about getting some of this in anticipation of bars and restaurants reopening after mass vaccinations. Should I wait for lower entry point in January perhaps?
"We''re back to no replies on the site, so replying via new post; a 'nominal decline' is generally no reason to be concerned, but the thud of -7%, and bouncing down around -9% is beyond nominal. Not being able to find ANYTHING on line to hint at what the issue is just adds to the angst in this portfolio owner!"
Why is this down so much with such a good report?
Good day to be in MGPI... bit of bumpy year but things seem back on track now in 2021. Let’s hope this Roseville Rye program only helps.
"10% in a day and no new comments... This is a solid company, been around them most of my life."
THIS IS ABOUT TO BOUNCE. INSIDERS AND INSTITUTIONS HOLD 135%. 35% SHORT. LOOK FOR COMPANY STOCK BUYBACK. MY TARGET IS QUICK BOUNCE TO AT LEAST $40
"What the heck is wrong with this? MGPI makes 1.5 million barrels of whiskey amongst other things and is largest NDP producer to the country. To the WORLD by deduction— This stock is undervalued at $60 !!! I’m a whiskey investor as well as a stock player and this is just stupid emotional reaction to the whiskies being affected via Trumpy tariff news and should have almost NO impact on the health of this amazing company.And no, I’m not a shill for them or any group. Just s small potato.Buy this now before the reality restores itself, I say."
"The Owner of Whistlepig has projected their Farmstock 001 offering, currently at roughy $90 a bottle, to hit $10,000 a bottle in 10 years based on this being the 1st product made with juice from Whistlepig in Vermont. Most of their juice has come from MGPI. Their Black Prince offering ""The Boss Hog"" is retailing at $500 per bottle. There are many other Scenarios like this. Besides production of alcohol based fuel, and their Fibersym RW resistant wheat starch...This stock is a homerun!!!"
"What is wrong with Yahoo's reply function this morning??? Appears to allow replies, but does not actually keep them on board????"
MGP Ingredients is up 10.31% to 41.85
"Great time to buy after the drop, in at $39"
MGPI reached a new All Time High at 83.04
