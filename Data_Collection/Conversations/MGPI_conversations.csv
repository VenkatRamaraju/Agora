"how funny. So, you're telling me that the earnings are reflecting backward earnings and the market thinks that earnings going forward are not effected by the employees stupidity of putting lives at risk. think again. Look forward to the all lows. Can't stop stupid."

"Darling Ingredients beats earnings by 50% and rises 5.3%. MGPI beats earnings by 100% and the stock falls, despite a rising price target. Again, if anyone in the shadows has knowledge, please drop it on me. Because for the life of me, I cannot understand why price performance on this stock in this sector is not better."

Really low average volume on this stock. Looks like 98% of shares are held by institutions? Thinking about getting some of this in anticipation of bars and restaurants reopening after mass vaccinations. Should I wait for lower entry point in January perhaps?
Bad company due to lousy CEO and board members.
I believe it's getting added to the s&p 600 index.that will surely help
"Continuing nominal declines, in the atmosphere of an overall generally up beat market... I wonder if the 'long term aging' aspects of being in the branded whiskeys is showing thru? (Requiring patient warehousing of product before it can be offered for sale, finally getting their money out.)Perhaps the set up of a stand alone division that can take possession of product which will hold while aging, allowing mama MGPI to 'immediately' monetize their output the day they 'sell' to the holding division.(?) Justa thot. (MIGHT be similar to how older brands have been doing their financial accounting for some time already???) Dunno."

"MGPI is changing their product mix from unbranded to branded, with both higher SG&A and higher margin. Also there is the sales risk of now competing with the customers who buy unbranded vodka/gin/whiskey/rye. Will long-term customers be forced to find another supplier? Sure MGPI has thought about the risk of trying to have it both ways.I remain a long-term shareholder...who is also concerned about the strategy."

MGP Ingredients sold off & then mostly recovered after reports the firm's plant in Kansas suffered a chemical spill $MGPI
"SHORTS GETTING KILLED, LOOK FOR $40 SOON"
This is company is doing well. Moving into the beverage alcohol has been a good move. Beer consumption is going down. Current price range seems to make sense.

Any idea what's driving volatility today...
"The Owner of Whistlepig has projected their Farmstock 001 offering, currently at roughy $90 a bottle, to hit $10,000 a bottle in 10 years based on this being the 1st product made with juice from Whistlepig in Vermont. Most of their juice has come from MGPI. Their Black Prince offering ""The Boss Hog"" is retailing at $500 per bottle. There are many other Scenarios like this. Besides production of alcohol based fuel, and their Fibersym RW resistant wheat starch...This stock is a homerun!!!"
MGPI is down 9.30% to 25.07
"This company makes great products, more than 1.5 million barrels of whiskey and spirits made in a year, and they provide them TO THE COUNTRY! Stock should be DOUBLE this low price of $35. Something must be wrong with management...."
Heads-up...second traunch will be larger than first.

O yeah! Earnings coming soon- looking for $45.00
I’m concerned that the CEO is saying they’re going to conduct a study on the Whisky business and try to figure out how it works. Shouldn’t you already be on top of that? I mean I’m ok with sales not meeting expectations but to not know how a crucial part of your company works sounds...completely idiotic.
MGP Ingredients is up 5.08% to 42.23
"We''re back to no replies on the site, so replying via new post; a 'nominal decline' is generally no reason to be concerned, but the thud of -7%, and bouncing down around -9% is beyond nominal. Not being able to find ANYTHING on line to hint at what the issue is just adds to the angst in this portfolio owner!"
U NEED TO TAKE GOOD LOOK AT =ALTO=GREAT BUY
What's going on? Down 10%
MGPI is up 5.38% to $75.00
This is the most ugly reversal in this market..
"MGPI just dropped 5.5% in after hours?!? Looks like a big spike sell off! Let me guess, that largest share owner woman sold off 14 days before Earnings Call because she KNOWS something we don’t— The Fix Is In!Such a scam."

"With 73.7% institutional ownership and 29.29% short interest, this stock currently reports at 117% stock ownership. It just beat earnings estimates by over 100%. How in the world is there not more retail interest in this stock, and how is it possible this has not become a massive short squeeze? Not trying to cause one, just trying to learn. Thank you in advance for any insight provided."

"What the heck is wrong with this? MGPI makes 1.5 million barrels of whiskey amongst other things and is largest NDP producer to the country. To the WORLD by deduction— This stock is undervalued at $60 !!! I’m a whiskey investor as well as a stock player and this is just stupid emotional reaction to the whiskies being affected via Trumpy tariff news and should have almost NO impact on the health of this amazing company.And no, I’m not a shill for them or any group. Just s small potato.Buy this now before the reality restores itself, I say."

Time to replace the CEO. Board members are also useless.
MGP Ingredients is down 8.22% to 25.67
They just collecting their salaries but the company is going down to a drain.
MGPI is a solid company. Another company that may become the future Anheuser-Busch for Cannabis Breweries and infused craft beers is BBRW or BrewBilt as they have successfully developed a state-of-the-art CBD pharmaceutical grade extraction system. BBRW trades at under a penny but the stock is about to take off.

"This 'little known' food-additive outfit in Atchison, Kansas is an amazing find; up 76% for the port here over a very short 12 months. One of my top three performers. Looking to add when I see a pullback of ~~~5.5%... it doesn't happen often, so I might well be waiting a while..."

"It seems absorption of LUXCO, the competitor and diversifying outward with their own products as well as quickly rectifying a few unsettling events that became oddly newsworthy has payed off... MGPI is in a unique position in that they are the largest providers of this kind of food and alcohol based product, have been doing it forever as leader in the space, and there seems to be an ever growing need for the products that they do provide!!! Whew! That was a mouthful... but all true. Not sure what there is left to keep this coiled spring down. Congrats to us Longs... your time is Now. "

The new 1.1% MGP dividend article says that MGP bought .9% of their shares back this year. Where is that documented?
"Is it possible to see another significant price drop at earnings call time in a matter of days? OR, did the dip already happen with the recent drop and pre earnings call info being shared a few weeks ago. Sounds to me like earnings call can't really say anything we don't already know at this point. Interested in buying but not sure exactly when. Anyone have thoughts on this??"
"When you look at a barrel of 4-8 year aged whiskey today, remember someone had the foresight to fill that barrel years ago...and be patient. Unlike white booze, such as Vodka and Gin that can be distilled on Monday and sold on Tuesday.""Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."" Galatians VI. Applies to MGPI."
Good day to be in MGPI... bit of bumpy year but things seem back on track now in 2021. Let’s hope this Roseville Rye program only helps.

Back to $70"
