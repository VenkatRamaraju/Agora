"Carnivore Trading recommended this as a buy to private subscribers at $107 on 7-7-20. They have had some explosive stock picks. Did a 47% short on ""SOLO"" in one day about 4 days ago."
Looks like the stock will basically be range bound down here for a while...bad for options holders.

Stock goes way higher from here..... If you want the best you have to pay up and Qualys is the best at what they do and the WanaCry is but the tip of the iceberg..... You either have to patch religiously or scan and patch and most people don't do a good job of patching so they need to scan to reduce the risk to the company....

TCCO last play out there that hasn't moved that benefits from the recent hacks in the news. Float of 1.5M shares. Surprised this low floater didn't go crazy on cyber attack news. Look at $FEYE $CYRN $QLYS $CYBR. All stocks jumped on cyber attack news. TCCO is potential sleeping giant.

This is one of the many companies that will benefit from the fall of SolarWinds (SWI) and the hack of the dacade.I am not even sure how is trading swI at the current price!!! With all the lawsuits and huge loss of many of their current customers this company will probably go bankrupt within the next weeks.
