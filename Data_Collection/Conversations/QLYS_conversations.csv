Nice earnings!
Why does this stock have so little volume and literally no one talks about it ever?
It’s time to turn things around
Easy buy
Building a base?
Investor meeting coming up and may be a catalyst for the QLYS stock. Added shares for the climb up.
is it down today because feb10 would be the quarter earnings call?
why is it down?
"This company is growing revenue about 20% per year, but is selling for a 54 PE. Seems overvalued here."

They managed to increase their quarterly revenues since the beginning, which is now more than 32 times.I have not seen many companies such as qualies. sooner or later the world will also recognize, that qualys is a Top company.in 10 years every body not having invested in Qualys will regret it"
