TCCO last play out there that hasn't moved that benefits from the recent hacks in the news. Float of 1.5M shares. Surprised this low floater didn't go crazy on cyber attack news. Look at $FEYE $CYRN $QLYS $CYBR. All stocks jumped on cyber attack news. TCCO is potential sleeping giant.

"Today, this stock, is the picture of wall street manipulation. This is the reason many investors stay away from stocks. Yesterday this stock gave stellar earnings, I repeat stellar. This mourning,6:20am, an analysis downgraded this stock, no reason given. The shorts took over from there with their 100 lots of buy/sell. Down >$2. Maybe some big short needs to get out. Check volume. Just another day on the street."

Where’s a good buy in after the drop?
Insider trading had its best they knew all of this a week ago and the insiders acted on it ????￼
This is one of the many companies that will benefit from the fall of SolarWinds (SWI) and the hack of the dacade.I am not even sure how is trading swI at the current price!!! With all the lawsuits and huge loss of many of their current customers this company will probably go bankrupt within the next weeks.

Stock goes way higher from here..... If you want the best you have to pay up and Qualys is the best at what they do and the WanaCry is but the tip of the iceberg..... You either have to patch religiously or scan and patch and most people don't do a good job of patching so they need to scan to reduce the risk to the company....
