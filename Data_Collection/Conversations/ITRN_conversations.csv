It's 14.64 today. CEO and his friends have to go. They hide behind lax Israeli regulations. No plan to turn this around. Looks like a class-action lawsuit is coming. Who agrees?

Why isn't there outrage when this company's stock declines by 50%? They hide behind Israel's lax reporting requirements like 10Qs required by US companies. We want CEO gone and a clear plan to resolve problems in South America. We demand action ASAP!
