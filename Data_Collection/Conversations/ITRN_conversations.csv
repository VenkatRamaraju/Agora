Why isn't there outrage when this company's stock declines by 50%? They hide behind Israel's lax reporting requirements like 10Qs required by US companies. We want CEO gone and a clear plan to resolve problems in South America. We demand action ASAP!

It's 14.64 today. CEO and his friends have to go. They hide behind lax Israeli regulations. No plan to turn this around. Looks like a class-action lawsuit is coming. Who agrees?
