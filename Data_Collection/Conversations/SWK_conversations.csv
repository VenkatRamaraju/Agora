"I haven't taken a position in this, but it seems like the current price might be a decent buy in point. A couple of questions for those who have held a position in this for awhile. Roughly what P/E multiple has this traded at in the past? It seems a bit low. Also, what are some thoughts on recent acquisitions? In addition to the Excel acquisition, I thought that I remembered reading that SWK acquired the Craftsman brand a year or so ago. Is this correct?I haven't taken a position yet, but am considering it as I am holding a few in my portfolio that are underperforming."
looks like a buying opportunity!!
Growth profile for this company is substantially under rated. Basically stole MTD.
"I had been watching and waiting for a good entry point for SWK for quite a while. It finally came yesterday. I didn't hit the low, but I got in @ $184.00. I am pleased."
Good day to all. Well Eve and I took another bite of the apple at 182.38 and hope this will be the end of this downward trend. SWK doesn’t concern me as much as the overall economy which is overdue for a correction. Been on this roller coaster for over 50 years and don’t have much time left but I keep having on. If you have a lot of time left in your life then history say go for it. This is America don’t ever be afraid. God luck to all. God bless America.
"wow, it remembers how to be green, smh."
EPS guide down
"it better find some support soon, otherwise, it is gonna be a rough ride."
"Somebody needs to get the tools out and start repairing, looking like a bum stock..."
Time for a class action suite for paying 3x for MTD than its worth.
Thanks for the 4.5% dividend increase. A shareholder friendly company.
The revival of Black and Decker brand will be a huge surprise here.
"On tipranks the lowest price target is $228, highest $259.Why is this stock dropping so much?"
When PPG reported a little while back it and the group (including SWK) got hit over supply chain issues. Valuation doesn't matter right now. The market feels SWK will miss estimates with a rebound not coming until 2022. I'm not selling here but I don't see a significant price recovery any time soon. The group is out of favor.
I stopped buying on the way down but have resumed now that it is on the way up.
"Going back to prices it was four years ago, smh."
"I bought the dip, I haven't bought much since I loaded up in March/April 2020. Time to go back up :)"
I have reviewed a lot of data over the past 2 weeks and have concluded that Swk is a good investment for someone in my position. Bought a small amount last week and plan to add more if price remains as low as it is now. I think the price swing and drop is due to overall market swings not Swk specifics. Wish all well.
"Regulatory scrutiny has NEVER found this company. Over the years, they have consumed and incorporated much of their competition. I have a problem with that. Emglo, Porter Cable/Delta, Craftsman..... to name a few. It just is not right."
"Omg, this stock is DESTROYING IT! Beats across the board, huge dividend raise. I hadn't planned on buying more because it's already a greater percentage of my portfolio than I wanted due to price increase but man, looking fantastic."
