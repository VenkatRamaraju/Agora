"Another new 52 week high! About nine months ago when SWK was $140, I said $170 before Christmas. Looks like I missed by a month, but I stuck with it, buying on the dips. Long SWK."
ill be watching in july to see if they buy out the remainder of MTD
Thanks for the 4.5% dividend increase. A shareholder friendly company.
"added at 136, but why so much drop?"
I think a split is in the cards. Two splits when it got high and none for a while. This is a solid company with a great balance sheet and a good knack for acquisitions not to mention a super reputation.
I am only thinking if tesla doesn't start making the tools :) .Does anybody has good answer with rational .
"Good Day for SWK today, waiting to see what it does from here"
"""Stanley Black & Decker seals the deal"" Jim Cramer last nite talking about how good the economy is doing."
Need to clear 150
"If you didn't buy SWK in March, something is seriously wrong with you....the most obvious money printer in the market."
Nice to see the share price recovering 8-)
Todays announced dividend increase looks good for Fridays earnings.
"Does it EVER stop? OMG, this thing is printing money out of thin air, haha.."
Is it the tariffs that are hurting the stock?
"Somebody needs to get the tools out and start repairing, looking like a bum stock..."
The revival of Black and Decker brand will be a huge surprise here.
"All based on the falling markets, weak housing numbers, trade tariffs, etc."
Looking to buy in the next several days around $114-115
security group could be the shining star net several years.
Tomorrow morning 2/21 SWK will put on a presentation at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference in Miami. If the market isn't selling off it should give the stock a nice bump.
bought in December happy with results
#$%$ is dropping every day for the last couple of weeks. Down 19 pts from its high with the market reaching all time new highs.
3 minutes after the opening bell and we're down $5.80??? What is happening? None of this makes sense
who's doing the selling? I'm buying.
Going to be a great buy real soon. Not time just yet!
"I work for Stanley I buy every month, the word number one tool maker it will go back up for sure."
Now down 25% from its high.
Hard to believe the 52 week high was 176
"Yes sir, was a no brainer to buy this..."
Was around here same time last year. After august is when the run up kicks in.
"Beatin the snot outta this in premarket.. numbers were okay, revenue a slight miss, with all things considered it was actually better than a year ago."
Looking Good!. I added to my SWK Wenesday when Stanley was on sale. Buying on the dips!!!
"Those huge buys at the end of the day, yes sir and the incredible price target lifts. This thing will be 200 before October at this rate."
"Finally this stock is looking good, showing some strength here"
Lots of great news today! Looks great going forward. Also crossed a key moving average on above average volume which is a very bullish sign. I am buying now.
"7/06/18-11:08 am- B:100 shrs. @$133.04Currently hold 200 shrs, previously bot 100 shrs. @140.10Target: $178 (18 mos.-Dec.2019)Rationale: Valuation, consistent earnings & div. increase,strong domestic market for high quality product line.This a comeback story in the making. JMHO.All the best,-rand"
Just came back from Lowes they are reorganizing the tool section making room for Craftsman. This is coming much sooner than the October time frame. The store manager was helping set up the displays he told me they are having a huge Fathers day sale to roll out the new to Lowes line. Looks like theres no more reason to go to Sears. Short Sears buy SWK!
I stopped buying on the way down but have resumed now that it is on the way up.
When PPG reported a little while back it and the group (including SWK) got hit over supply chain issues. Valuation doesn't matter right now. The market feels SWK will miss estimates with a rebound not coming until 2022. I'm not selling here but I don't see a significant price recovery any time soon. The group is out of favor.
$125 before $110
With earnings in less than a month away. I bought more SWK today. $133.50
BOOM...easiest buy there is right now...winning.
"Earning tomorrow morning. I know they will be good, I hope forward looking earnings are good. I believe SWK likes to UPOD."
Stock price should steadily climb from here...undervalued..
Time to go to 200 within a year
hi been here along time said about three years ago we will be over 200.00 here we are. next will be a stock split so they can get there dividend up to near 5% good luck all longs
Growth profile for this company is substantially under rated. Basically stole MTD.
"I bought some more SWK today. I am a long tern investor, and I see SWK as a growth stock. Will keep adding."
Here comes the slow moves up into new highs moving forward
$200 end of 2019 please
NICE DAY
Crushing the game! Grabbing some more and some CVS
This is starting to look appealing....just saying.
Buy at $137-138?
"Is there a chance to grab more shares in 70 area. My thinking is one big hit, more stimulus dollars, and then up."
"no worries stock is up over 20% this year, big money playing with the stock so they can get cheaper. if you look at my past posts we will break though our all time high by years end"
"P.R. ahh,nice move yesterday,guidance UP"
...don't sell at this price unless you desperately need the money..too cheap...
Earnings and revenue beat. Down 1.56 percent in pre-market. Go figure.
I have reviewed a lot of data over the past 2 weeks and have concluded that Swk is a good investment for someone in my position. Bought a small amount last week and plan to add more if price remains as low as it is now. I think the price swing and drop is due to overall market swings not Swk specifics. Wish all well.
"No other stock i've ever watched acts this way, seriously a $24 drop in 8 days, what is going on, who is manipulating this stock?"
"I'm sticking with SWK, bought more yesterday at $140"
Wow I'm surprised we are down after those earnings. Buying opportunity?
"This name is a winner in lockdown and during reopening. I have a 78 percent return dating back prior to the beginning of the pandemic. This name didn't work for me for a long time but it is firing on all cylinders now. 200 is finally here. Stay tuned folks, the ride isn't over yet."
"Bought SWK at 112 well prior to the pandemic...this stock hardly did anything for me for a long time, it would go up, then retrace whatever gains it made...all I can say is I'm glad I held on because now my gains exceed 40 percent and growing. Proud to be an owner and always knew this company would do well eventually."
"Check the after hours price, up 1.89%"
I was told their earnings report beat market expectations?
"Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) had its price target lowered by analysts at Nomura from $188.00 to $169.00. They now have a ""buy"" rating on the stock. 52.6% upside from the current price of $110.74."
Wait for the analysts upgrades!!!
what is causing the large drop after hours today
We have hit bottom and bounced
WHY IS DOWN
just look at all of the acquisitions in the past three years starting to corner the market in the fastener industry corners the market in tools and countless others health care ect you get the picture half on of them have not even added in yet to earnings easily $$$170.00 plus at this price great dividend buy all you can$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
"Love this stock, like to see the mid 150's"
With a boom in housing there is going to be enormous demand for SWK tools. The soil for this company to grow in right now is extremely fertile.
"Looking for an earnings beat and a dividend raise. Springtime, all the do it yourself and handyman coming out of hibernation, Craftsman doing good and tax cuts."
Good day to all. Well Eve and I took another bite of the apple at 182.38 and hope this will be the end of this downward trend. SWK doesn’t concern me as much as the overall economy which is overdue for a correction. Been on this roller coaster for over 50 years and don’t have much time left but I keep having on. If you have a lot of time left in your life then history say go for it. This is America don’t ever be afraid. God luck to all. God bless America.
"Wow, I've been waiting to buy in but it keeps going down. Any idea around where it bottoms?"
Very nice beat and raise. Raising 2021 Diluted GAAP EPS Guidance Range To $10.80 - $11.20 (From $10.15 - $10.55); Raising Adjusted EPS To $11.35 - $11.65 (From $10.70 - $11.00); Reiterating Free Cash Flow To Approximate Net Income.
"Again there are taking it down this morning., Comical!! I will just keep adding at this levels. This is a $200+ stock by the end of 2018."
"5 mins before crammer says to buy this a purchase of of 200k shares lol, i’ve noticed this a lot with CNBC analysts, check the stock they say to buy and you always see a large buy a few mins before they announce to buy, total fraud pump and dump short term for a small gain"
"Compared to SnapOn’s 1 month price movement this is a safer tools and hardware bet. Pairs well with HD and LWE, I’m holding long into next year, new year means new projects around the house, new tools for the work shop."
"dividend increase soon??not that it matter's,last split was June 1996."
"wow, it remembers how to be green, smh."
Best buy in the market....
12 Dec 2019 closed up 5.12% with no company specific news. What the heck? Maybe reports of China trade deal possibly?
"On tipranks the lowest price target is $228, highest $259.Why is this stock dropping so much?"
Anybody else listen to the CC? Sounded very positive on the whole. My guess on the weakness is it has to do with concern over completing the acquisition of MTD and organic growth as opposed to buying growth. That's all I can think of cuz from the perspective of current earnings and the guidance........as well as the divi raise......there appears to be no reason for the selloff.
...on our way to breaking 150 very soon...about time!
What is going on with this stock. It dropped 25 pts from its 195 high 2 weeks ago. It's barely up for the year. Is there a reason for this drop ?
"I bought the dip, I haven't bought much since I loaded up in March/April 2020. Time to go back up :)"
I am shocked at this price. I would like to say this is a buying opportunity but I have been saying that ever since it started dropping six or seven months ago. This one has got me baffled
"Goldman Sachs Adjusts Stanley Black & Decker PT to $228 From $222, Maintains Neutral Rating-Morgan Stanley Adjusts Price Target on Stanley Black & Decker to $234 From $230, Maintains Overweight Rating"
"Omg, this stock is DESTROYING IT! Beats across the board, huge dividend raise. I hadn't planned on buying more because it's already a greater percentage of my portfolio than I wanted due to price increase but man, looking fantastic."
I added some shares under $140 today. Great entry point. Stock has gotten pounded for no reason!!
EPS guide down
Same thing is happening to CAT after their solid earnings
How long has everybody here been holding? The 10 year on this one looks incredible.
"Going back to prices it was four years ago, smh."
keep going!
Here’s a link to Lowe’s search Craftsman. Everything Craftsman is now basically available on there online site. All supplied through SWK.https://m.lowes.com/search?searchTerm=craftsman
Earnings due tomorrow AM. Consensus is 2.14. I'm thinking a beat.
"Jim Loree, Stanley Black & Decker CEO, discusses the impact of the current state of global trade on the business and the American manufacturing sector. Stanley Black & Decker wouldn’t see massive disruption from trade disputes ""we make where we sell""."
"""ba da ba ba bah I'm lovin it"""
Wow 15%? That is a little much given the report.
"Serious money printer, hahah"
Can't understand this stock?
Nice beat~
"Great earnings beat, but lowered YOY earnings forcast."
Why does Yahoo show a symbol SWP for Stanley Black & Decker? Different price but with the same message board?
SWK getting some well deserved love today.
Let the dividends buy me some cheap shares while I wait for the rip up
This stock has been going down like a rock. I can't believe that it has gone down 22% from it's highs.
"Got that nice dividend, thanks SWK..."
"Had a very good day today, like to see it get back to the highs, around 174. That would be nice !!!"
"I’m assuming the sears bankruptcy is bring this down. Considering the deal with the craftsman brand this should be positive. Lowe’s is now carrying the craftsman brand through SWK sales. SWK was not selling craftsman at sears that was sears sales and income. Just noticed at my local Lowe’s they replaced the shop vacs with the craftsman labels. So as far as sears going under and the craftsman line seems like a good situation for SWK. After all there is a Lowe’s close by to any location in the US that can’t be said for sears. https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-stanley-craftsman-tools-rollout-0820-story,amp.html"
"it better find some support soon, otherwise, it is gonna be a rough ride."
Time for a class action suite for paying 3x for MTD than its worth.
"Beat, raise, div increase, MS reiterates buy PT $234, infrastructure deal passed and the stock drops over 3%? Am I missing something here? Surely all of that was not priced in."
I don't get it... everything I see looks pretty good.
"I had been watching and waiting for a good entry point for SWK for quite a while. It finally came yesterday. I didn't hit the low, but I got in @ $184.00. I am pleased."
Hopefully going back into the 150’s and keep going from there. Long time comin.
"Another good week, like to see it continue higher!"
Stock should surge tomorrow after Mexico news.
...should pop before earnings
"Director just bought 907 shares yesterday at $112.93. Not a lot of shares, but I will take it lol"
Anyone seeing this a a buy opportunity?
"Apparently, I should have just thrown everything, including the kitchen sink at this stock. SERIOUS money printer. Up big since March, lol."
"Stanley does it again!!!, Smashing earnings!!!, Great dividend, Buy on the dips, Long time hold."
Price moving up from a H&S pattern
looks like a buying opportunity!!
"Nice bounce today. I did not catch the bottom, but I did buy at 149 and change."
Could reflect the overall health of the stock market
"Regulatory scrutiny has NEVER found this company. Over the years, they have consumed and incorporated much of their competition. I have a problem with that. Emglo, Porter Cable/Delta, Craftsman..... to name a few. It just is not right."
Another 9 pt drop today where lowes and home depot barely went down. SWK is one of my worst performing stock. Ot now lost the whole gain for the year.
I think 210 is coming soon.
"I haven't taken a position in this, but it seems like the current price might be a decent buy in point. A couple of questions for those who have held a position in this for awhile. Roughly what P/E multiple has this traded at in the past? It seems a bit low. Also, what are some thoughts on recent acquisitions? In addition to the Excel acquisition, I thought that I remembered reading that SWK acquired the Craftsman brand a year or so ago. Is this correct?I haven't taken a position yet, but am considering it as I am holding a few in my portfolio that are underperforming."
I like this company .
"Very disappointed with Lowe's. Did not see a big Craftsman Father's day sale, but ACE HARDWARE did, TV ads, newspaper ads on Craftsman toolboxes and lawn and garden tools, DeWalt and Irwin tools. ACE is the place!!!."
Were almost at a 2 year low. Wow this is getting a bit over done now!!
