#NL Industries ( $NL) Accumulation going on. Buy rating: 7.5 at 9trading. Looking for breakout at 3.85. http://www.foxchart.com/share/831321829NL.png
NL owns 87% of CIX. Just the value of CIX exceeds the market cap of NL. In addition they own 35.2m shares of KRO which is worth $387m. They have $90m in cash and some liabilities and litigation exposure which is manageable. The stock is worth $12 a share if they would just dividend out the CIX and KRO shares to shareholders.

"NL owns CIX, CIX market value is about the same as NLâ€™s market cap. NL also owns about $500m of KRO stock which is not recognized in the market cap of NL, so NL seems way undervalued. I appreciate the litigation for NL but they have $100m in cash."

NL and CIX appear to be one and the same company. Why are they listed twice? Same boards on the profile. If NL became CIX why would NL still be trading?
Any reason for the today's 14% pop up?
