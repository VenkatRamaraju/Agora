"Huge! Russia to ban log exports.Yahoo often does not allow me to post website inks . You can find the story on woodbusiness.ca *just type Russia log exports ban). The ban won't occur until next year, but it speaks volumes. Contrary to those that think ""there are plenty of trees"" it is in fact not true. Yes, there is an exception in that the U.S. southeast does in fact have excess trees and so I would expect more lumber mills to built there over time. But when we think the huge expanse of Russia feels the need to limit log exports has to speak volumes. Expect more sales and higher prices for U.S. trees."

"This one is a Short Seller's wet dream for today: Grossly overvalued stock in a narrowly caged specialty sector experiencing an unsustainable price bubble and due for an imminent price collapse. Reporting earnings today AH, with all eyes focused on the future, a DOOMED future in terms of an inevitable, near-term lumber price collapse.... Gonna be all over this one to the Short side, before market close today. :-)"

You are correct sir. They have big holdings on lucrative tracts near the proposed new Cape Caneveral space pad on Georgia coast. This area is literally going to the moon!
Cannot grasp this stock weakness despite strong housing and lumber demand and their considerable valuable land holdings in northeast Florida. Feedback welcome.

"So, I guess if 100 shares were issued for $10 a share to fund a purchase of picnic supplies, the stock would open at $10 a share? Today's trading on the 5m share issue seems to show that to be the case! Personally, it looks to me to be a good investment."
