Random length lumber almost at a new high nearing $1000. Wow.
"This one is a Short Seller's wet dream for today: Grossly overvalued stock in a narrowly caged specialty sector experiencing an unsustainable price bubble and due for an imminent price collapse. Reporting earnings today AH, with all eyes focused on the future, a DOOMED future in terms of an inevitable, near-term lumber price collapse.... Gonna be all over this one to the Short side, before market close today. :-)"
Would all the fires in CA and OR push up or down the share price?
Going up after earnings today

"Huge! Russia to ban log exports.Yahoo often does not allow me to post website inks . You can find the story on woodbusiness.ca *just type Russia log exports ban). The ban won't occur until next year, but it speaks volumes. Contrary to those that think ""there are plenty of trees"" it is in fact not true. Yes, there is an exception in that the U.S. southeast does in fact have excess trees and so I would expect more lumber mills to built there over time. But when we think the huge expanse of Russia feels the need to limit log exports has to speak volumes. Expect more sales and higher prices for U.S. trees."
Earnings beat today should push RYN to $35+.
She's going down after earnings.... :-)
Why is the stock down today? I keep expecting some trade war event to bring the stock down. Is this happening?
"Where would you all suggest for someone who is brand new to investing in REITs to go for information on the industry and the company itself (like occupancy %, rental income only, etc.)?"
