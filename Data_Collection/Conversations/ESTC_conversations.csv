"No buy out! Management and Board not interested. Current tension with AMZN has spooked investors BUT NOT the customer base according to user polls and reconfirmed by recent Merrill Lynch BofA analyst work.Waiting for $110 level to take advantage of current tech valuation pullbacks, concerns about all companies not reporting profits and noise around AMZN relationship. 3-5 year opportunity for $200-$250 price level.An acquisition proposal from someone like SAP, Cap Gemini, CTSH or even CRM would of course get price up sooner."
So beats great results but down? What a piece of…
Revenues accelerating! Approaching escape velocity!
Wow guess the market doesn’t like this new hire??
"aws buyout soon, 400"
the report looks pretty decent revenue FY20 revenue guide raised to $423-424mil. loss per share better than expected too of -1.13 to -1.12. will see how the market reacts.
Should be up $10 or more tomorrow
Here's a fundamental analysis from a developers point of view:https://medium.com/ml-stocks/elastic-nv-an-essential-stock-for-the-tech-ecosystem-53fa8c7cc2ed
WTH ... this doesn’t make sense at all!
"Elasticsearch 7.9 was released today. And things look great!Elastic has updated to version 7.9, which comes with an overhauled Kibana, data ingestion help, additional security features, and more.First of all, an important thing is that now elastic includes a new malware prevention, which can help from cyber security issues, such as what happened few weeks ago. Elastic handle such things also with a preview for the event query language (this one is related to Elastic’s acquisition of the cyber security company “Endgame” last year).Since data processing is at the core of Elastic’s business, one of the more major improvements in the company’s stack has to be the reworking of the way core component Elasticsearch, an search and analytics engine, ingests data. The fixed ingestion queue of the project has been exchanged for a flexible one, with a new subsystem accounting for the number of bytes associated with an operation and rejecting requests exceeding a set limit. Elasticsearch now also knows a wildcard data type to make the search for partial strings more efficient.Earnings reports soon, I’m bullish."
BOOM!!! Accelerating REVENUES!!! love that ESTC decided to double down on cloud security!
"As per PTJ, msft should buy these guys... it really makes a lot of sense."
"I like this stock above $74. With a breakout of that value, $ESTC stock could easily go to +$100. Watching closely."
"I think it will work, just may take a few days... makes no sense"
"Monness analyst Brian White maintained a Buy rating on Elastic (NYSE:ESTC) on Monday, setting a price target of $200, which is approximately 79.23% above the present share price of $111.59.White expects Elastic to post earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.43 for the first quarter of 2021."
Yesterday 25% of locked shares were unlocked and began trading. The volume spiked 6x and shares dropped a little over 3%. The remaining shares will be trade able by insiders at the start of the third day following the April 2nd blackout. That should be April 5th. Caution is recommended until after the next very big block of shares become trade able and the market gets an opportunity to evaluate the new supply vs demand economics. I expect we’ll see a little softening in the two to six weeks following April’s lockup expiration. Good luck!
"bought this week. work with elasticsearch since years, great product, good support, solid company. to finally get in ESTC stocks was almost a nobrainer to me. nevertheless fundamentals also looks good for me."
ophir pick . this and docn
aws coming
"I went thru the Q1 earnings report and compared it to today’s and I have to say I’m at a loss for the after hours price action. In their Q1 earnings report they guided revenue between 95 and 97 million and beat it with 101 million and guided for a non gaap eps loss of 30-32 cents and beat it with a loss of 22 cents. Subscription growth also accelerated nicely between Q1 and Q2. This all looks good to me.Looking at next quarter guidance they are guiding revenue between 106 to 108 million which is slightly ahead analyst estimates and would project around 6 million above Q2 which is similar to the 6.5 million growth they guided between Q1 and Q2 and ended up beating. The non gaap eps guidance of a 35 cent loss vs analysts estimates of 33 cents is a slight miss from expectations but history seems to indicate they end up being a little conservative here anyway.Full fiscal year 2020 guidance has improved for both revenue and non gaap eps from the Q1 report to the Q2 report which is a plus too. It’s just hard for me to believe a 2 cent eps difference in Q3 guidance expectations would drive the stock price down 14% after hours, especially when its easily manageable given the increasing revenue stream. Anyone have any thoughts on this?The stock price was"
"Merrill analyst:Solid quarter with shift to ratable clouding the real storyESTC is down 14.5% AH, despite a solid 2Q with total revs, recurring revenue, OM, andEPS beating our estimates by 5%, 5%, +693bps and +$0.11 and raised FY20 revenueguidance to $416mn (53% y/y) vs $409mn (51% y/y) previously. The stock is likely downdue to: 1) billings deceleration of 41% y/y and 45% y/y in CC vs our 47% and 51% y/yand 53% y/y in CC in 1Q20, and 2) organic RPO implied bookings (ex-Endgameacquisition) grew 32% y/y, vs 73% in 2Q19 and 37%in 1Q20. However, in our view,these results are mostly driven by the faster shift to a recurring model with monthlyratable contracts and away from up-front recognition, which is a headwind to revenueand is therefore clouding the true performance of the business.LT outlook positive based on key focus metricsWe reiterate Buy. In our view, the focus should be on the following positives which webelieve outweigh the near-term blemishes:1) We believe ARR is the right way to look atthe company going forward as it takes into account the shift to recurring and cloud andis a strong proxy for future revenue. ARR (calculated as subscription and SaaS (cloud))accelerated to 65% y/y vs 63% in 1Q20. 2) When you look at the billings deceleration inthe context that the shift to monthly ratable revenue (5% of total revenue at IPO vs 10%now) likely takes away $4-6mn of sequential billings recognition, plus the governmentdeal slippage, the billings metric is stronger than reported. 3) The remaining part of amonthly cloud contract does not show up in RPO, understating real growth, andtherefore we think ARR growth is a better indicator. 4) Cloud accelerated to 106% and114% in CC. 5) Even with the shift to ratable, revenue growth accelerated to 63% in CCvs 62% in 1Q20. 6) Mgmt. raised guidance suggesting strong visibility into the year. 7)Shift of business from upfront to ratable is good for long-term"

Ask any software engineer if they are using or are considering implementing Elastic Search into their products at work.
This should have been up today big time
I got in on Fri for $78. Based on Splunk’s results they should have a nice runway to top revenue and earnings when they report. I could see this settling in around $87-90 by the end of the year.
OPCO analyst Ittai Kidron maintained a Buy rating on Elastic (ESTC – New Research Report) and set a price target of $110.00.
"cal tech won $1.1 billion suit vs. aapl & avgo, aws settles it or pay huge"
"Bought another 600 shares under 66 just prior to close. So many things I like about estc. Valuation since ipo, tipping point on product suite, open source, and of course data search etc at these prices feel I’m building base for long term compounding 10x"
"- Elastic (NYSE:ESTC): FQ1 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.06 beats by $0.24; GAAP EPS of -$0.23 beats by $0.20.- Revenue of $128.87M (+43.7% Y/Y) beats by $7.93M.- SaaS revenue was $32.6 million, an increase of 86% year-over-year, or 86% on a constant currency basis.Easily qualifies for ""rule of 40"" and imo Elastic will continue to eat into costly Splunk's market share. This company has a ways to run."
Elastic is up 4.99% to 181.66
Please someone explain why this is valued at 5B when it has 185Mil Annual Rev & -61Mil Income with 52Mil in cash??
PLEASE ANNOUNCE HOW MANY SHARES YOU BOUGHT AT WHAT PRICE AFTER HOURS
"Let’s have a educated guesstimate of the share price; 12 months from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now?My guesses: 1.20, 5.00, 50.00"
"Thanks to those who do not understand the revenue recognition math. If you have a chance read the Merrill research report and analysis this am. Target over $130""results are mostly driven by the faster shift to a recurring model with monthlyratable contracts and away from up-front recognition, which is a headwind to revenueand is therefore clouding the true performance of the business.""Taking the opportunity in this pullback $62-65 range we are loading the boat for nest 24-36 months."
"Someone sold 50k shares at $65 ten minutes ago, suspicious... be careful!!"
"Solid beat, both revenue and EPS, next Q guidance above analyst estimates. Full year EPS guidance above estimates, revenue slightly below estimates due to Covid 19.Stock will be green tomorrow !"
"Following the earnings report, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated his ESTC buy rating while ramping up his price target to a Street-high $95 (6% upside potential)."
Strange price patterns. Only solution is to continue to build position on weakness and hold for long time 5yrs plus. It seems to be a trader’s stock vs investor. I want to be an investor. Confident 3 or more years from now estc will be worth a whole lot more than it is today.
"White noise. After hours trade and meaningless over 3-5 yr period. Lots of organic growth on existing products, new product expansion and acquisitions."
Full year Revenue was $427M .. compare with $COUP - $390M.. and $COUP trades at 14B valuation while this one is at 7B valuation.. lol.. this is way undervalued.. i will short COUP and long ESTC.
