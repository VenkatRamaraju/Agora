Viasat's Industry-Leading Ka-band In-Flight Connectivity Service For Business Aviation Now Available through Collins Aerospacehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/viasats-industry-leading-ka-band-120000738.html$VSAT
"When the airlines rally, this stock will blow up! Right now it's being hampered by this segment of the business. I guarantee the correlation! So just hold if you own shares, and in 2021 there will be a rally in the airline industry. When? Your bet is as good as mine. I guess when we have a substantial number of Americans vaccinated with the Covid19 vaccine. Or before this, since the smart money is ahead of events."
"This will be a make or break two weeks for ViaSat. The earnings report tomorrow and a satellite launch next week will be pivotal to the future of the company. A good earnings report which shouldn't be too hard since the analysts seem to be rather conservative on their expectations which is simply amazing. Add on to that a successful satellite launch and this stock could see a major positive movement. The consensus earning of 28 cents per share is actually very conservative as it is lower than the past two fourth quarters. Then add the wide disparity of analysts from .14 cents to .44 cents, it could be either a major beat or a major miss, could be a very interesting stock tomorrow. Probably a good stock to bracket, it will either be up by 15% or down by 8%, as it has been in a very negative trend leading up to earnings."
We are well oversold.... the bounce is coming
"Viasat is facing a serious new competitor that starts service later in 2020.We can debate how much business Viasat will lose to SpaceX, but I don’t think anyone can deny that Viasat will some percentage of their current market over the next few years. Worse case scenario, Viasat fails entirely. Many companies cannot survive 30% of their market disappearing. Fixed costs and debt are deadly.1) SpaceX has a launch cost advantage over every other satellite service provider.2) LEO (Starlink) is much closer to Earth, so speeds are faster. Lower latency to bounce signals. GEO (Viasat satellites) is 500 milliseconds, LEO is 20 milliseconds.3) Starlink satellites are cheap, about $500,000 each. Designed to last only 5 years or so, then fall back to earth. The benefits are iteration. Every batch of 60 Starlink satellites are always getting better. Satellites designed to last 15+ years are incredibly expensive and become obsolete within a few years."
I'm wondering what is your target price. Mine is $80 YE21
"Just for grins and because I think the market is oversold, I covered my VSAT short and went long today. 55.82."
B. Riley just came out with a $145 price target.
"@shaggy,About 1/3 of Viasat's business is vulnerable to competition near term from SpaceX Starlink. The 586,000 rural internet customers will be captured by Starlink over the next 2-3 years as they come off of contract.The other 2/3 of Viasat's business is of course government and commercial contracts, which are more long term and custom. So Viasat does have alternatives to redirect their capacity (losing rural customers) to government customers.EchoStar HughesNet is much more rural internet focused. So the SpaceX Starlink hit on that company will likely be far worse."

"James, apparently I owe you an apology since you believe I am a facist, not really, just kidding, I am in the age category where I don't accept or give victimhood, sorry, you aren't worth an apology. With that said, let's address you comments. Tesla's debt is convertible, the stock price is pushing 1,000 a share, don't see any of the creditors jumping on that deal and if they thought it was a sustainable price they would be all over it. The reason why I call you a Musk troll is all about your statement concerning the new Semi tractor and the fact that it is made from a single piece of stainless, sorry worked for Navistar, making class 6 to 8 trucks and there is no way that was made from a single piece of stainless (oh by the way, what grade? 314, 316L or otherwise). Also worked for GM, Lear, Exide, JCI in automotive, know a lot of people in the industry, many who worked at both the auto plant in CALI and the giga battery plant in Nevada, a lot of stuff going on that the news media is burying, trying to help out a fellow tree hugger liberal is what I assume. Now in regards to Space X, we now have the trifecta of a Ponzi scheme that will rival Bernie Madoff and actually will make it pale in comparison. We have Space X, Solar City and Tesla, all have tremendous amounts of debt, tremendous. All seem to be brought into the fold as needed or left out to prevent any real information from leaking out. The end result is that it only takes one domino dropping for the entire structure to collapse. Elon is a very smart man, a friggin' visionary not seen since Leonardo but still the same a snake oil salesman as well. What happens when he has to pay back the 41 million to New York because his solar city plant didn't meet hiring numbers or does his buddy Bloomburg come to his rescue like all similar minded liberals do or does he do his job and look after the tax payers of NY who are getting hammered by their own taxes? You and your buddy smkcstr and the usual short trash talkers, I've dealt with your kind for decades and you talk a good game but if a single analyst had the same concerns and they are all fully aware of the potential competition that LEO offers to Viasat they wouldn't have a price target exceeding 90 dollars a share. This is a typical short attack, you are the mouth pieces and you lack anything that would be considered earth shattering news, merely false narratives. Now go back to your mommies's basements and continue playing whatever video game that you spend your days playing and eat your milk and cookies. If you really want to discuss real issues please feel free to ask. By the way, the military would never ever consider a company owned by a foreign national who smoke weed on national television and who would expect to use some type of software jumping algorithm to ensure the safety and security of the nation. Worked at NAVAIR and NAVSEA as well, just sayin'."
"with more competition on the way (Starlink, Amazon, Echostar, etc.), what's the future of this company?"
Viasat just won $122 million in CAF II auction.
"Hard to say why Viasat is swimming upstream of the market today. Could be the Baldridge buy, but I think it more likely the announcement of United’s decision to add connectivity to its E145’s. Pretty clear Viasat has the inside track on those aircraft and nobody had them in forecasts."
"The Muskites must come to his defense, Tesla at current market prices has lost 33% of its value in a week. I am certain this will have a very negative sentiment to new investors to include the 2 billion in additional dilution that our boy told us Elon sold at 760 a share, now that is already a 100 dollar a share loss for those investors."
American Airlines finally made official they are going with Viasat on their 787-8’s. Another nail in GOGO’s coffin.
"Shaggy, are you on the autism spectrum? None of what you write makes any sense.1) Tesla today is back at the price from January 29th, 2020 during the spike. $650 per share is a crisis? Tesla sold stock at $760 and raised $2 billion. 2) Elon is a multi billionaire worth $30 billion even after this market decline. Up about $10 billion in the last year. I doubt he cares, he never sells his personal shares.3) per the Tesla 10k, Elon has total liabilities of about $600 million. He is worth 60x more than his total debt. Not leveraged much at all.4) I have no position in Tesla, I don’t really care.5) I am shorting Viasat into bankruptcy. Not a day trade or short term trade. This stock is going under $10 per share because it is not viable against Starlink.Viasat $700,000 / Gbps, built and launched.Starlink $25,000 / Gbps built and launched.This is not even remotely a close call. Starlink is going to obliterate the GEO satellite data companies."
"On March 9, 2020, Elon Musk claimed that thanks to Starlink, anybody “will be able to watch high-def movies, play video games and do all the things they want to do without noticing speed”. Thus, Musk explicitly underlines his wish to reinforce already massively energy-guzzling digital activities, such as video streaming and online video games. These consume just below the whole electricity consumption of Europe (if you want figures, the world digital energy consumption of 3,834 TWh expected in 2020 is comparable to the 4,077 TWh for European electricity in 2018). Their share of world greenhouse gas emissions is already 4% and could double to 8% by 2025.Musk’s declaration ends on an ominous note, in essence saying “My clients will be able to do whatever they want, just as I am able to do whatever I want”. The Federal Communications Commission appears to be ready to give Musk its blessing. After all, the Commission’s space department is not shy about its priorities: authorize more satellites, faster, with much less regulation.Thus the American authority tasked with regulating US telecoms – which recently decided to drop the Net neutrality principle – turns a blind eye to the privatization of space by a corporation that wants to take over the low Earth orbit region. All this in the spirit of the 2015 Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which allows US industries to “engage in the commercial exploration and exploitation of space resources”.The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, declared outer space to be a common good of humankind. Today this may seem quaint to some, but it is more necessary than ever."
"Could VSAT hit $60 per share by year end? Based on 9 analysts (6 buy, 3 hod) VSAT average target price is $75.79. (source is Refinitiv Ratings). TipRanks Ratings for VSAT is Strong Buy and Avg Price Target $70.75 (with a low at $60)."
"Stock price wise it’s no worth selling here, let the seller get cleaned up and this will pop back up. Don’t worry"
"Ron, good information on ground stations. Do you believe Elon's cost estimates of 500K per satellite, I am an electrical engineer mostly in defense and manufacturing so don't really have a feel for magnitude of order but that value seems ridiculously low. Also as you said, you would have to replenish the constellation every five years at a huge cost."
Viasat has a $600 million line of credit that they need to survive while building the three satellites. Banks are starting to consider cancelling lines of credit as happened in 2008-2009. Boeing pulled the full $13 billion on their bank line of credit just in case. Watch out below if Viasat loses their line of credit.
"Another big day scheduled for market, James I may disagree with your thoughts about the near term prospects of LEO internet but I can't fault your timing of market moves."
Will we see over $100.00 tomorrow?
"Seems like this stock is getting near a value buy since it destroyed on earnings. Gotta find the bottom first, then I will be buying a few calls"
"Everything looks good for a solid upside move tomorrow for VSAT, at least to $72, IMO. Maybe more, maybe a lot more. But it depends upon what the market was actually expecting. The stock is near a 52 week low right now. I think these results could really move the stock up. I hate to be over-confident, but I think $80 is not an unreasonable possibility. the future for VSAT looks very bright and strong, and investors might finally wake up to this fact, tomorrow... :-)"
Game over. Bankruptcy coming right after Starlink starts service.
Stellar results again and room for lots of growth ahead. The launch of the three ViaSat 3 units should give a great boost. I understand that ViaSat 4 is in development but I dont know what its projected capacity might be.
So I have been holding VSAT for over three years now. Got in at $57 and rode it to $90 then went down with it and bought more at $60. Then Covid struck. VSAT got hammered and I never knew whether or not they’d come back. I held my shares in hopes they would come back ONE DAY. This run they have had makes me want to tear up or better yet bang SOMETHING/ANYTHING. I’m getting choked up just thinking about it. CONGRATS LONGS AND WELCOME NEW SHAREHOLDERS. THE FUN BEGINS NOW!
"Taken from Tim Farrar twitterKerrisdale Capital @KerrisdaleCap 5h5 hours agoMoreIn 2014, we wrote on $GSAT. In 2015, it was $STRP. 2016 was $DISH. 2017, $VSAT. Tomorrow, we release this year’s report on satellites, spectrum and the market’s recent rocketship stock"
Viasat faces very difficult competition from SpaceX with the new Starlink constellation. Shorting this stock now at $61.33.
What was the earnings per share?
"James, I do agree that should the Starlink LEO system does become a competitor or for that matter any of the other systems that residential customers will potentially shift, the market is price sensitive, no doubt about it, also agree that government contracts are not at risk. The equipment is very specialized to the application and for the most part the source of the satellite communications is not one of their satellites. They are acting more as a third party equipment and service provider. Though as Samir said, this was a classic short attack, pretty amazing how easily they are able to drop stock prices throughout the markets. Scary actually. I bought in at 26.02, hope you are right about come back."
"52,000 some shares traded and a lot of them were obviously set up deals, largest trade was for 1,060 shares."
SpaceX Starlink is going to crush Viasat's aviation revenues.https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starlink-job-posting-billion-dollar-market/
"Who is buying Viasat? Its not a matter of if, but rather when they are made irrelevant by Starlink. I think Starlink has proven they are not going away which means Viasat is just living on borrowed time. 3 years or less this company is done. If you have the patience, alot of money will be made shorting this stock down to zero"
Isn't this a coincidental that Vsat downturn started when Comtech announced they are buying Gilat (cheaply)? Together they may present a formidable competitor. IMHO
VSAT reports losses but CEO and the management bonuses are higher each year. 2020 CEO compensation more than $11 million??? WT???
"Market makers still trying to set the tone for a weak open on weak after hours and pre market trades. The earnings were a sound beat, met expectations, great call and they never really addressed directly the fact that the capitulation in the satellite markets will help the survivors, OneWeb bankrupt, Intelsat bankrupt, Gogo very likely will not survive the year."
Vsat sales going thru roof.
"How much more of a free-fall for VSAT?I guessed wrong to have support at 60, but gone lower, now 57+.Financials ok, however, the competition greater than what VSAT has in stock.Well, at least have a dead-cat bounce to trade back 62 to 70."
"If Big Investors betting $175M at $39.11, seems like it's a safe bet at $37-38. Starlink is a competitor of sorts, but at this point, seems all that is baked in. Insiders had bought at $55 pre-covid to show confidence. So IMO, feels safe to buy here and ride until $55, and maybe even $70-75 where it has been historically."
"ViaSat beats by $0.11, reports revs in-line4:21 PM ET 2/6/20 | Briefing.comReports Q3 (Dec) earnings of $0.39 per share, excluding non-recurring items, $0.11 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.28; revenues rose 6.0% year/year to $588.2 mln vs the $582.39 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.""We achieved another quarter of solid revenue growth and margin improvement in our Q3 of fiscal year 2020,"" said Mark Dankberg, Viasat chairman and CEO. ""We're building on a differentiated foundation of business fundamentals in our government systems and satellite services segments. New contract awards and backlog signal continued momentum, and build confidence in a strong finish to our fiscal year 2020 and on into fiscal year 2021."""
"This may be what's holding both stocks from rallying today. At this point, no one can tell if VSAT over-paid at 17% premium, or got a steal. Rignet stock is down too. Usually, the acquired company stock rallies on news of an impending buy out. The buying company stock usually falls as investors weigh whether the acquisition was the best use of capital, if they gave up too much for the acquired company, and the fact that its dilutive to current shareholders. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rignet-merger-investigation-halper-sadeh-133900434.html"
"(copied from one of the Space websites)A little comparison of capacity costs between Viasat, OneWeb, and Starlink:-Viasat 2 has a throughput of 260GBps, and had a cost of $600 million, giving an installed capacity cost of ~$2,300,000/GBps.-Viasat 3 satellites are expected to cost around $700m total per satellite, and have an impressive capacity of 1TBps. This gives an installed capacity cost of ~$700,000/GBps for the next gen Viasat 3.-OneWeb satellites have a throughput of 8GBps and have a cost target of $500k per satellite, launched on Soyuz gives a per-satellite launch cost of $2.5m. Put all of these together and you have an installed of around ~$300,000/GBps. If you factor in the lower possible capacity factor from time over the ocean, this is not much better than what Viasat 3 should be able to do.-Starlink satellites have an estimated launch + manufacturing cost of about $500k, with the launch costing more than the satellites. With a throughput of 20GBps, this gives and installed capacity cost of ~$25,000/GBps. Now, since the launch cost dominates the total cost, adding Starship to the picture should more than halve this. They are currently producing satellites at annual rate of around 1,500 per year... quadruple this (which is what you'd need to do to get a 30,000 satellite constellation), and I see no reason that Starlink's installed cost shouldn't drop below $10,000/GBps.In short, $/GBps installed:$2,300,000 Viasat 2$700,000 Viasat 3$300,000 OneWeb phase 1$25,000 Starlink$10,000 Starlink w/StarshipViasat is toast"
"This stock of any is not going to be impacted by Corona virus, mostly government contracts and in particular military contracts. Add to the fact that most people are looking for ways to avoid crowds, so wouldn't one assume that would actually improve their residential and commercial internet businesses. Regardless of what James is saying, there is absolutely no time line on when Space X, Oneweb will have a viable competitive product on the market. Furthermore, when it does happen, the impact will be very limited."
Dany missed the meeting... Everything must be on track stock is still up!
"@Shaggy, get ready for when Hydroxychloroquine word gets out. This market is going to take off. I am covering all shorts and only long."
Does anyone knows why all the satellite companies jump today? $SATS $VSAT
So I bought this at 36 and sold it at 46..
"Ron, actually have a brother-in-line who works for them (VSAT) in Atlanta, he travels around the world installing systems for military and government agencies, a business that doesn't develop overnight and never for a man named Elon Musk. He has finally made peace with NASA but State Department and Pentagon never will."
"Shaggy, the difference between EchoStar and Viasat is $2.5 billion in the bank. EchoStar has it, Viasat does not. Each company has debt, $1.9 B for Viasat, $2.4 B for EchoStar. But EchoStar has far greater cash resources to survive longer term against the competition and build a new strategy. Viasat lacks the resources and has sunk cash into three more big expensive obsolete satellites for 2021-2022."
"I'm liking the momentum today. Good news from Moody's too. On another note, why is there an army of people down voting every comment on this thread? Don't the Musk fanboys have anything better to do?"
"Earnings-Reaction to Watch Thursday $MCK , $WUBA , $EGHT , $BBY , $ADSK , $BRC , $DECK , $HRL , $DXC , $LXFT , $GPS , $LGF-A , $MDT , $NTNX , $RY , $QSII , $SAFM , $ROST , $THR , $SCVL , $TTC , $SPLK , $TD , $VEEV , $VSAT , $YRD , $ZOES http://crweworld.com/Earnings-Calendar"
So what communication bandwidths does Elon own to allow for this dramatically improved coverage? Does he manufacture or design the receivers? Are his satellites large enough to hold enough fuel to reposition themselves for years rather than one time and done. Then one has to ask why a company like Gogo who is absolutely an one trick pony is up nearly 25 percent over that same time period.
"https://www.viasat.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/viasats-first-viasat-3-satellite-achieves-major-milestone-viasat/ 1. Early 2022 release for Viasat 3 1st payload. 2. World’s highest-capacity single satellite3. 15 yr life4. The 3 payloads combined are 8x, yes 8x Visat’s current capacity.5. Payload 3 (early 2023 launch?) 6. Visat’s getting better at press releases (my opinion!)"
VSAT reached a 52 Week low at 57.18
"I’ve been buying and holding since COO bought in at 55. Seemed credible. Held through initial drop and bounce back...added more in low 40s, more in mid 30s, but now starting to wonder if there is a plan...delays in VSAT3, lack of PR...how long do we hold?"
"12/16/19 - ViaSat awarded a $90,300,000 indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract to provide AN/PRC‐161 Handheld Link 16 radios, ancillaries and associated training to Special Warfare Operators."
"@shaggy, when I was at the Raymond James investment conference on March 4th in Orlando, I heard the Viasat CEO speak. He mentioned then that they were already seeing the revenue hit from the loss of airline passengers. So that portion of the Viasat revenue is probably all that is at risk this quarter and next quarter. So there is no telling how much of the decline ($61 to $31) is related to China Virus issues and how much is related to the market expecting coming SpaceX competition issues. Probably a bit of both, but mostly Virus. The market is just selling everything the past few weeks for margin calls. I am waiting for a rally in this stock before I restart the shorts and puts."
"James, will wait a bit. Being dropped on low volume, will buy when heavier upward volume comes in. Looks like Solar City will lead Elon into the abyss well before Tesla."
Is this company in trouble? Take a look at cash flow (see the statements on Yahoo Finance) for last 4 quarters and years. Business not bringing cash - what is the accounting trick here?
Good conference call!! Should go up tomorrow..
Viasat is up 6.06% to 43.22
"I agree with Shaggy. Its not practical and Viasat will eat them for lunch in the marketplace. Viasat has beat earnings every quarter I have looked at them and now they are making a profit. In two years this stock by all analysts is going to be 140. SpaceX is going to be struggling financially, but making lots of inspirational news stories about the world of tomorrow. This reminds me of the struggle for fusion energy or robots, it is possible and it will probably happen someday, it was great science fiction when I was growing up, but its a lot harder to actually do it and make money and we dont have those things yet. Viasat is building there own GEO satellites, terminals, ground stations... Even if this LEOs are successful (which I find improbable), Viasat will make money regardless because it will be cheaper and they will have more customers.As far as SpaceX/WebX/Amazon and the media, I worked on LEO satellites for years and I worked on ONEWEB program until it went under the first time) Wall street, the media, and a lot of people have all drank the coolaid without knowing how difficult this is. Read the blogs from companies that specialize in phase array terminals. I am a microwave radio engineer and I know how stuff works and what they are promising is not practical in 2020 or even by 2025. Its a beautiful vision but the execution is going break them like so many dead companies on this path. Viasat is now world satellite leader for BW, and already has working terminals, customers, relationships with countries involved, distribution network and designs at a fraction of the cost of what any LEO ground terminal will cost. The reason for this is Viasat GEO system uses a fixed dish its very simple, LEOs user terminals will need 1 or 2 phased arrays or mechanical gimbles to track satellites, not to mention the upto 1 MILLION ground stations to support the satellites, Do the math a support ground terminal is going to cost 3000 or so minimum X 1 million thats 3 billion, every user terminal is going to cost 1000$ (very optimistic). Not to mention none of the LEO space hardware is working correctly, does not even have the optical links and it de-orbits so rapidly its going to cost a fortune to keep sky net up."
Viasat is up 4.94% to 32.08
"VSAT is losing money because of the huge capital expenditure represented by VSAT3. If you back out this cost, it is actually quite profitable."
50 by feb 04
"Oh well, buying again, they drive it down with weak volume and then it ticks up with heavy volume."
"Wow, $51.43 now. Did you get out of your purchase earlier today? Doesn't look good. So sorry. Thoughts and prayers."
https://www.law.com/2019/06/11/fiber-optic-faceoff-in-socal-a-second-look-at-return-mail-plus-stanford-asks-who-moved-my-claim-construction/
VSAT is down -4.94% to 63.73
"I covered many of my short positions today. Tidewater (TDW), UBER and VSAT. I have gone lone Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Taiwan Semi (TSM)."
"joe, if you look at the volumes the past two weeks it is becoming apparent that it is getting harder and harder for the shorts to drop the price of the stock, early last week they could do it with minimal volumes, yesterday it took three times normal volumes. Low enough volumes to indicate no major players selling but enough to imply that short sellers are having to buy and sell shares at a higher volume than they would have previously to fabricate a major price drop."
"Starlink already threatens optical astronomy. Now, radio astronomers are worried. Astronomers are asking for assistance from the UN."
Timber!!!
I covered my short on VSAT today. Waiting for a rally that will likely happen tomorrow.
"BAUPOST GROUP LLC/MA, 10%-Owner of VIASAT INC BOUGHT 2556891 shares on 2020-07-23. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=VSAT"
Why is it down 3 besides fact market tanking? Was guidance bad?
I wonder if the Intelsat bankruptcy will force them to sell their satellite portfolio and if any of the assets would be of benefit to Viasat.
If you wanna double your Monday invest now
"Being manipulated lower on Low volume and general fears of a market collapse? Cant imagine this is a justified drop in price. Remote work is increasing and need for Govt and rural satellite communication is a must. Will it become an AMZN subsidiary? I'm still adding, but it's not easy to be bullish when there's blood in the streets of Carlsbad. :O"
143.00 Price Target!!! Whaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Trading at $71 right now! :-)
"Rick Baldridge just shelled out $1.5 million to buy 27,150 shares at $55.54. Nice show of support during a rough time. Time will tell if it was smart or just a show."
VSAT is down -4.90% to 67.32
Anyone thinks that we will see 75 again before June?
What’s happening here
"There is, bought back in, 10 percent drop with volumes that are less than daily average."
"Let me see here, Tesla (and sorry James there is no getting around this fact, Space X and Tesla are tied at the hip with each other) will lose billions in potential revenues. This will cause a cascading effect through Tesla and eventual trickle, more like crash down on to Space X. That additional 10 billion in cash that Elon needs to launch his LEO network will be hindered that much more."
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Soon I will be part of this family once my $rnet stocks get converted to $vsat. I was thinking about selling but after doing some research I think we can see some good growth next year. So, I will stay in touch. Happy Christmas and a better next year."
VSAT is up 9.82% to 36.12
Will it have similar fate to UBNT?
VSAT is up 5.07% to 62.54
"James, were you also aware that Viasat already had collaboration agreements with two of the largest tech companies in the world, Microsoft and Facebook?"
"Went Long 1500 shares of VSAT at $67.16, a few hours ago. This is a Pure Earnings play, VSAT reports earnings at 4:05 ET this afternoon, and I am expecting a very good report, beats on EPS and Revenue accompanied by in-line or raised Guidance. I expect this baby to go up on the ER, looking for a 6-10% jump to the upside, and feeling good about this play. My confidence level is high on this one, but every Pure Earnings play carries significant risk of significant loss, because none of us are psychic. Never do this type of play unless you are perfectly willing to lose 10-20% of your capital in a single day. I am so willing, and so here I am for my regular weekday adrenaline rush. :-) Good Luck to all!"
Viasat just awarded a $96.2 million contract for MIDS upgrades.
Rignet??? Are you serious????
"Technical Break Out........... Momentum trade is on he table. Then again, this company will be BK real soon."
"Where is the rally in VSAT? I want to short it again, but I don't think it has rallied enough after the virus scare."
"James, definitely not trying to help you out here but should you not consider the fact that the stock has finished green every day since the huge Corona virus scam/scare drop and volume for all of these days has been about triple normal volume. Just sayin'."
"Beat estimates by about $0.09/ share and earnings/ share were positive. Overall very good, price should stabilize and climb slow but steady."
"Their bright reflections are already blocking the views of astronomers looking for deadly asteroids. If enough of them become disabled, which is already happening, they could also block off space travel for decades.Wouldn't that be something, Elon makes enough money off of Starlink to build a rocket to go to Mars and he can't launch it due to reason he has the money to begin with. Talk about irony."
Still holding up; the future is on our side!!!
"One analyst listed 25 companies that probably wouldn't survive this and Viasat's only competitor (now at least) in the aircraft internet business Gogo is on the list, this is their sole business, so the airline traffic hits them really hard. Survivors of this could very well be positioned to gain business."
"With this launch, SpaceX has now launched 775 Starlink satellites, counting two prototypes launched in early 2018. However, 47 of those satellites have since reentered, either through deliberate maneuvers or natural decay, according to data maintained by astronomer and spaceflight analyst Jonathan McDowell."
"Hi Debt,Viasat is currently building three new gen 3 satellites called Viasat 3. Each one is estimated to cost about $700 million to build and launch. So about $2.1 billion total. Based on the CEO's comments at the Raymond James investment conference on March 4th, they have spent about half of that amount so far. So currently, cash is low in the company and they have a $600 million line of credit they are living off of until 2022 when all 3 new satellites are launched and can start producing revenue. Cash is tight for the next two years with all of the required spending on the three new satellites. Also, SpaceX Starlink is about to enter the market and begin stealing some of Viasat's customers."
Volume is above daily average. New 52 week low. Down twice as much than the overall market percentage wise.
"Shaggy, I am just day trading. Long term Viasat and HughesNet are going bankrupt. There is simply no pathway for either to compete against SpaceX. The capacity and cost advantage that SpaceX has built-in is simply overwhelming. These little daily swings are not relevant to the long term fate of Viasat."
"Why would Elon need to dilute current shareholders equity position at Tesla with a 2 billion dollar new issue if as James states the company now has 8 billion in cash (with the 2 billion from new issue)? Company claims they are profitable, company claims they are increasing production, company claims they are selling all vehicles with little to no discounting, why the need to dilute shareholder equity? One, to use this money to finance Space X. Two, to misuse equity dilution to short stocks that are competitors of Musk, in attempts to increase funds by pushing false narratives. The same thing that occurred when Elon theatrically rolled out his new semi, three years prior to even having a prototype for testing (which is supposedly is somewhere in Canada doing cold weather testing), was he shorting Cummins, Paccar and Navistar then? Is he doing that now with false promises?"

"It is true that Gogo is not a satellite builder, yet they are in the same business as Viasat in regards to providing WiFi to airlines as part of their business, again whether you wish to admit it or not if Space X was a major concern to take any or all of that business their stock price would be impacted as well. Apparently not too many other people share your concerns. Analysts who are very tuned into the satellite communications sector still have a price target of over 90 dollars. To date there is no evidence that Starlink has or will take any of VSAT or GOGO's business."
Next SpaceX launch with another 60 Starlink satellites is planned for Monday February 17th.This launch will bring the total launched to 300. However a few of them were for testing and a few are bring intentionally de-orbited.They should have basic service being offered in North America by late 2020 after 6 to 8 launches. The February 17th launch is the 5th launch of 60 satellites.Short VSAT
"Curious how much longer the market makers allow this to go up, the usual pump and dump has impacted nearly every major stock. The big money push a stock or dump a stock to only change direction on a dime and then reverse the direction, sometimes to repeat the process over and over. While VSAT had good numbers, they are still losing money."
"Bought at $30, sold at $55. Nice!"
It seems my post yesterday was removed? Any thoughts on what this Azure deal with MSFT means to VSAT.
"James, the market knows that they can easily attack any stock in a very wounded market. Of stocks that people should be worried about revenues and earnings, Viasat and Echostar should be the least of their worries. Let's face facts, the short term is the only thing driving stocks and the markets at the present, people could care less about LEO competition, Elon can throw all the satellites in the world up but as his financial empire starts to crash down around him like everybody else who has tried it, they ended up bankrupt. Guess Elon is now worth about half of what you said last time. But let's look at the existing satellite internet providers, we see that Netflix is doing very well because of what is going on, of course, more people at home, more people needing internet, people who have Viasat and Echostar are not your waiters and waitresses at Shoney's they are farmers, ranchers, etc. who are actually making bank right now as the rest of the world spiral's down around us. The main part of both Viasat and Echostar's business comes from military and government contracts, do you really think they will be impacted? In the short term these stocks will report better than the likes of Apple, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, Google, etc.. Viasat doesn't have to worry about businesses making decisions on whether they want to advertise on their platforms, they charge a flat fee, end of story. Get in and get out. This will blow up when earnings comes out, that is what people know. They are merely using gross overreaction to Corona virus to pummel stocks regardless of what fundamentals tell us, buy cheaper and sell higher. Will buy when we get closer to earnings, this will have a huge move up once they announce."
Did they report the warning?
"@Shaggy, here is my current long stock list. Zero shorts or puts owned right now. Bought Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning: Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Disney (DIS), Taiwan Semi (TSM), Tesla (TSLA), JP Morgan (JPM), Broadcom (AVGO), Boeing (BA) & Kinross Gold (KGC)."
"Narrator: SpaceX has said its satellites can automatically move out of the way to avoid collisions. But dozens of SpaceX satellites are already disabled and can't move at all, posing a potential threat. And those concerned with SpaceX's plans are lobbying the FCC to rein in the company and more strictly regulate low-Earth orbit. And that could make it more expensive and harder to deploy the planned 42,000 satellites. But it doesn't stop at Starlink."
"This is too cheap too ignore. Echostar is also on the same boat. No one wants these companies now, till they want them.cycle the markets. This company can’t stay at half the value. SpaceX is competition but takes long time to establish these sort of companies , even more international markets."
VSAT acquires RigNet...the company doesn't look dead to me. All these shorts painting the stock and company as a finished play. They may want to buy here and give back those shares. Synergistic acquisition.
I like the acquisition of RigNet. Just happened to be announced on a rough market day. Bleeding red everywhere today. Anyway this this is oversold and I expect a solid bounce over next month
"Algorithms sense that $VSAT stock is close to support and consequently, might be a quick technical buy around the current priceYT"
How are you hanging in there Shaggy? Rough day down 5%? I suspect this stock will be at $10 per share within 2 years.

"Hey, its already paying off. VSAT is up tp $57.20 already.I am still long term bearish, but short term rally mode bullish."
Hate to say I told you so but told ya this will hit 50
"Wow, huge down day. Approaching 52 week lows. There is no bottom here."
there are obvious reasons why stock is falling. smart investors are trying to leave in time. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/viasats-existential-problem-mehdi-mehdiyev/
"EBB, it could also have been a coordinated short attack which is not uncommon among low volume stocks. When you start to see postings from relatively unknown (lower comment posters) who start to spout off ""facts"" that may have a hair of truth but they use that as a reason for the stock price dropping, it is usually indicative of a short attack beginning. Sometimes these are followed by analysts statements who are working in conjunction with shorting brokerage houses who are also paying for or have employees who are posting as the short trolls as in the case of James. Other times it is the likes of short story writers such as the Street Sweeper or Muddy Waters who also use similar attacks before presenting their false narratives in the format of a very detailed white paper."
"Do you really think Viasat is going to have the resources to compete when Viasat is barely profitable right now? What happens if 10% of their customers switch? What happens if 20% of their customers switch? What happens if 50% of their customers switch? Under just about every scenario, Viasat will go from being mildly profitable to losing a lot of money.We will see who is correct on this subject. But I would suggest that you take a good look at the competitors that are launching right now (OneWeb and Starlink). There is a lot of money to be made shorting VSAT and SATS (Echostar) as they collapse in the coming years."
"Out VSAT at $65.23 for a loss of just under $2.9k. Another failed Pure Earnings play, and my first Red week of the year. There will be more, I am quite certain. But the months and years are much more important than the weeks. I think I have an excellent chance of going and staying Green for the month of February, despite a bad start to the month. I gave this baby until 3:30 PM to perk up, but then had to unload her, to do my next play, Short 3200 shares of EPC at $30.69. EPC reports before market open on Monday, and I am looking for a poor ER, and a drop in the stock price to the $28 level. Best of Luck to All and enjoy the weekend! :-)"
"SpaceX To Play Bigger Role In This 'Massive' Live-Fire Air Force Exercisehttps://www.investors.com/news/spacex-starlink-satellites-virgin-orbit-massive-live-fire-air-force-exercise/In December, the Air Force tested its experimental Advanced Battle Management System that will connect air, sea, land and space assets. The exercise was deemed an overall success, with SpaceX Starlink satellites used to link to a Lockheed Martin (LMT) AC-130 gunship.As a next step, the Air Force's April 8 event is going to be ""massive,"" Air Force acquisition chief William Roper told reporters at the Pentagon Friday.The SpaceX Starlink satellites will play an even bigger role than in December, as Roper wants them to connect to more assets, including platforms on the ground.""SpaceX has been a great industry partner for us,"" he said. ""They are very excited, and we are excited to learn more about their satellites through the demonstration."""
"Interesting that Echostar investors aren't concerned about anything, actually up nearly 20% since May, so explain that to me James and they do have their own designed sats in geo orbits."
"Mark, haven't seen your cheery face in awhile. A little bit of history on America's ability to react to Pandemic, though the Corona virus is nothing to that level, mortality rate is between three and four percent and you must remember the population that it has impacted. The Chinese population, mainly in smaller (yes, populations of 10 million people is small in China) industrial towns is relatively mal-nourished, have multiple forms of respiratory illnesses or diseases from the horrible pollution, therefore their overall immunity to the most basic of viral infections is very low. The USA now has the capability within one pharmaceutical plant location just outside of Raleigh, NC to produce vast amounts of vaccines in days, weeks, not months or years as was required previously by production with chicken eggs. Just like human insulin is no longer produced from animal pancreas is now done synthetically, vaccines now can be created synthetically in a fraction of the time that was normally required. Currently, thanks to the Genome Project and the use of Super computing a biotech company in Cali. has developed a vaccine in a matter of three hours, the biggest hurdle is going through appropriate FDA regulations. The pharma plant above is in Holly Springs, was originally built in conjunction with the US government and Novartis, I believe it was eventually sold to an Australian company back in 14 (CSL I believe, big in blood and plasma products)."
"FTNT coming back UP right now, an opportunity to get out with profit if some of you are nervous about holding for tomorrow..."
Where are the people who believed star link will crash this??? I’ll take my profit even before stal link starts working
Time to come back
"Man VSAT has a low trading volume, and WOW super low today. Hmmm, what's up with that? With all the talk in the current administration of getting broadband to rural areas, and Viasat already having government contracts, they must be in on this potential internet expansion?!?! Fingers crossed..."
"You all better get out of this sinking ship, Starlink is now rolling out their program, I just paid my 99 dollars to pre-order. I live rural, everyone I know has ViaSat and WILL be canceling. Get out now, save your money to put into Starlink once it IPO's. Trust me as someone who has had it for 5 years, it's garbage and the company is garbage, with no future. Simply can't compete against Musk."
"James, based on your statements you should of course be shorting Loral Space and Communications as they provide services to Viasat and they also have Canadian based Ka Band products on Viasat 1. Just so you know, as it is pretty apparent you know nothing about the sector."
"Also, how much longer do you really believe that countries such as Russia and China will allow for profit companies from America to continue to push the limits of the Kessler effect."
Going down with the ship. Good luck boys
"Just got starlink 2 weeks ago. Needless to say I am cancelling my Viasat service. Absolutely no comparison between the two. 90mbs down and 15mbs up with Starlink, and no data caps. At least for now. Starlink will literally put Viasat and Hughesnet out of business if they can manage their growth and can build out the capacity."
"Charles, any picks for mon morning?"
"I just want to see a short squeeze with this float, got paid on SPG same exact way. They short the bottom and cover on a huge rip"
"James, I suggest you do some research on Iridium and Globalstar, this is nothing new and Musk is relying on countries and non-profits to pay for the services required to allow access for billions of people who are in poverty. Really believe that will happen, dream on, also at the LEO that Spacelink is using they would have to hand off the signal every three minutes, good luck with that, let's see how seamless that will be for consumers."
"So is this low enough now for the big money to drive it up on earnings (it doesn't really matter if they are good or bad, just used as a catalyst) or are they going to use it to tank it back to 52 week lows so they can drive it up from there?"
The market rallies 9% on Friday ... Viasat is down for the day. The market knows that SpaceX Starlink is launching 60 more satellites on Saturday. Competition is coming.
VSAT is down -5.84% to 67.58
"I have finished researching my next Pure Earnings play, for Thurs AH/Fri PM, and in the end it came down to a head-to-head showdown between VSAT and FTNT. Both of these plays look very good to the upside, and choosing one over the other was very difficult. But I have done it, and I choose VSAT. Here is a brief rundown of my impressions and research analysis:VSAT: Very good Earnings History, EPS and Revenue beats for five consecutive quarters. Excellent stock reactions to earnings reports: 2 15+% pops in past 9 ER's. Growing revenue. Recent very positive news, USAF contract awarded. Analysts are bullish. Excellent and unanimous upside potential on PT's. Company not profitable last year, but is on the cusp and expected to become profitable this year. Financials are good, but not great. Stock is near a 52 week low, and there are good reasons to think this ER will not just beat, but beat solidly. A 7-12% upside move seems perfectly plausible, on a strong beat. FTNT: Outstanding Earnings History, 11 straight quarters of beats on both EPS and Revenue, a rare feat! Outstanding Guidance History, they have guided higher 9 of the last 12 quarters, even rarer a feat! Stock price reactions to earnings are very good, but slightly less than VSAT. Analysts are bullish, but upside potential near-term appears less than VSAT. Company profitable, slightly overvalued. Earnings this quarter might be under pressure due to two completed acquisitions. Excellent overall financials, slightly better than VSAT. The main reasons I am choosing VSAT over FTNT are: Better upside potential on a very good ER, and less downside risk of a big drop, if the ER is not that good. Of course this is all just my opinion and you should know that every Pure Earnings play carries the very real risk of a 10-20% loss of the capital you put into the trade. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
71.68 PT is a joke)))
Another 8.5 mil in da haus. UK contract. Love it
"Viasat awarded redacted value contract for 1,400 enhanced bandwidth efficient modems from DLA. Figure the value at $10 millionish. That’s over $100 million in defense contracts in the last couple weeks."
"Hope all have read the annual report, I really appreciate how simple they make it and how transparent they are. VSAT is a truly unique company and well balanced in customer base. Based on what I have read the SP should easily get back into $60-$70. GLTAL, and to the shorts who think Starlink is going to put them out of business is like suggesting that Piper Aircraft is going to put Boeing out of business, lol!"
Viasat is down 6.27% to 49.02
Should I buy another 100 shares when market open !?
Yes sir
"Your story gets weaker and weaker, yes, look at the number of shares owned by institutions and mutual funds, do you think that happened by accident? So Blackstone Group has a junior level trader selling two and three shares every two minutes, yes I believe that is happening."
"Well we already know that the big money boys who originally pumped this from the low 60s to almost a 100 and then dumped it already know what the results are so they are dumping it. Though it is difficult to say whether they are manipulating the price down with ""fake"" trades (selling the same shares back and forth to each other while slowly dumping the price) to try and get better pricing for additional stock purchases and/or to set a negative tone to the stock just prior to the earnings report to make any positive news amplified that much more. OR they know that it will be a less than stellar report and are selling even more positions."
Viasat is up 9.18% to 42.11
insiders picking stocks now. Some sales but mostly the directors and vice presidents buying shares at the moment. New important deals and agreement is done and the future is bright.
"Shorts will take this higher, all that space x talk had people confused about shorting this name, see you over 60, I thought 50 but who knows maybe even 70"
"James, I might be willing to accept your theory for shorting Echostar, but not sure if you know what you are in for with Viasat, very manipulated stock, look at the five year charts, they drive it down hard to make money shorting it and I am afraid you are a bit late to the party, though I do appreciate the fact you are up four bucks a position right now, but they make a killing on the rebound, last time they drove it to nearly 100, not sure when it will happen but when it does, it will be quick and you may not be able to cover your position before going from green to red in a matter of minutes."
Look at how much is owned by institutions and mutual funds. They have to get out. They know Viasat faces a difficult competitive future.
"Wow, 250 million dollars, and they had to raise more cash to do that, I thought they were cash flush. Elon, does more than just own shares of Space X, it is a private ownership arrangement, he owns approximately 54%, of course a controlling interest in Tesla through super majority voting rights. Just as he made the unilateral decision to ""buy"" Solar City, he will transfer monies back and forth as he deems necessary."
"Nice pop today.The company seems to be maturing.Here is one of many positives by Dankberg today:""We are executing on our objective of converting our investments in prior periods into significant revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth now in fiscal year 2019."""
Have you guys noticed the azure advertising on social media by Microsoft. Guess what VSAT is a major provider for this new system
"Almost humorous how rigged the markets are anymore, Gogo is up 25% today, really??"
"Funny to read Brian Starlink fanboy. He believe starlink is answer of everything. The true are vsat have the contracts, and the market. Yes, they are threatened by Starlink's better satellite technology, but this gap will be closed in a short time. VSAT still has the contracts, the market and the cashflow. VSAT works, but I agree the transition to new technology may be too slow. Nevertheless, VSAT will probably find a solution via an acquisition. It is also not possible to play video games with the technology from starlink. Starlink provides better latency on sequential data transfer which is completely pointless. Smaller files that are transferred randomly still have a latency. Starlink got 20 ms at very best in their poc. 40-50ms is general + latency on the rest of the infrastructure. Im bullish on the long term for vsat. Positive and good cashflow which will increase during 2021."

"Earnings report was upbeat and certainly headed in right direction, always good to be in the green."
Baupost Group spent 1.5 billion dollars in the last week purchasing assets that have been seriously beaten down during the virus hoax. Baupost is by far the largest shareholder in VSAT currently. We will have to see if they have increased their overall positions.

Explain to me how Tesla and SpaceX are connected other than Elon owning shares of both?How does Tesla having an issue affect SpaceX?SpaceX just raised $250 million in fresh cash equity for Starlink launches. They are fine for cash.
VSAT... Wow... what a diamond in the rough! This is easily a $50 stock with such a low float and solid business plan. I don't expect this company to be here long. I'm thinking a buyout is imminent at these levels.
"You had better sell if you are green or near it, they just set you up to take a big fall. The Muskites will tank this one again.SpaceX begins accepting $99 preorders for its Starlink satellite internet service as Musk eyes IPO"
"Space x beta tests are fine but the dilution and money needed to realize profits is years and years away, short this I’m ok with selling you stock in the 50s"
"I've read the report, and it has some sense. Nobody cares about revenue if it makes 0 profit. the management is silent about debt repayment. Huge debts IMHO. it means Viasat will be unprofitable for many years even if Viasat-3 brings a lot of money. Mark should share his strategy and financial guidance openly (if he has any)."
Well I certainly didn't expect this.But I've been holding for over 20 years and this stock has always traded oddly.Great long term hold in my opinion.I would probably add this morning if I didn't already have a full position.Good luck to all.
"ViaSat Lands $560M DISA Communications Service ContractNichols Martin August 31, 2018 Contract Awards, News 103 Views ViaSat (Nasdaq: VSAT) has landed a potential eight-year, $559.9M contract to provide Ku-band and Ka-band communications service to Defense Information Systems Agency senior leaders and staff when they travel by aircraft.The contract has a one-year base value of $55.7M along with seven option years, the Defense Department said Thursday.DISA received one proposal for the firm-fixed-price contract through a solicitation on FedBizOpps and will use fiscal 2018 and 2019 operations and maintenance funds to cover the contract’s face value.Initial work will mainly take place in California and Colorado from Sept. 1, 2018 to Aug. 31, 2019."
"Agree stock is in limbo right now and drifting with the market, I will average down along the way, long term I see more upside than downside, but just an opinion. Mgmt is product focused not stock holder oriented."
So now the earliest that Starlink Public Beta Testing will begin is late February 2021 and is only scheduled for upper Northern parts of United States and Southern parts of Canada. Quite a change from Elon's original predictions of October 2020 and it was supposed to be a much wider reach.
"Space X convinced Goldman that they would be making more revenue from Starlink in 2020 than from launches, they had better commercialize those satellites really quickly."
What do you guys think about the earning?
"Earnings of 0.03 per share versus consensus of (0.01), Revenues of 591 million versus consensus of 591 million. Continuing a very strong back log, improving profits. Likely to be winner with Gogo probably going bankrupt in the aircraft wifi business."
The shorts will panic soon sell over 40
"I find it interesting that technology as a whole has done well and subscription based companies have done exceptionally well, yet for some reason they have really tried to tank this."
"Wow, they continue to perform very well. Crushed earnings, beat estimates by 12 cents. Revenues held steady and backlog increased significantly. It was obvious the government contracts are being pushed out but that is ok. It appears that airline business is slowly getting its feet back.I would accumulate any dips and hold for 60-65 range."
"Ron, need more people with practical, real experience rather than the Elon Musk's trolls. Ron, you seem to have a decent understand of LEO's, so how many satellites does it take at LEO altitude to ensure 100% of GEO altitude? Currently Elon, has made three launches with 60 satellites each, we haven't really gotten any verifiable data on the harvest rate of those 180 satellites and I don't trust a word from the greatest showman on earth since Barnum. Will it take 500, 1000, 1500? Furthermore, what is the customer acquisition cost, and how many potential customers do they really have? The story as told by Musk is that LEOs will compete for terrestrial customers, at the end of day, they merely cut their price as their customer acquisition cost is vastly lower. So no customers from existing terrestrial ISPs. So the remainder of customers is the 10% of North America that doesn't have terrestrial ISPs that would want internet. Of the 660,000 customers that Viasat has for their residential services, how many would actually switch? Remember we are talking about ranchers, farmers, trappers, miners and other similar demographics that may not value the higher latency that LEOs are potentially offering, let's say they convert fifty percent, at the end of day, Viasat still is a viable company. James says that he isn't a Musk troll, he doesn't have an opinion of Tesla and seems to imply that the Tesla story is irrelevant to the Space X story, sorry but it is all bundled together. The failure of one starts the cascade of failure for the Elon Musk story. All fours legs of the table are heavily in debt, that is Space X, Tesla, Solar City and the Giga Battery Factories. I know that Tesla , Battery division and Solar City division are all incorporated under Tesla but they are acting as individual entities. Elon when he started the Starlink Constellation concept estimated an initial cost of 10 billion dollars to create the initial network, he estimated annual revenues of 22 to 30 billion, that is a wild estimate given the potentially small customer base. Let's also add to the equation that Space X is barely profitable based on the current launch schedule, estimates for new launches for 2020 to 2022 put the launch division at a huge loss, without a quick way to commercialize their current Starlink system, Space X goes heavily into the red. Soon, Boeing and Virgin will have much lower cost space entry vehicles which will potentially make Space X, Russian Space Agency and European Space Agency rocket launches a thing of the pass. Time is definitely ticking for Elon and his financial Ponzi scheme."
"Near its low for the year, resistance! Time to buy!"
Viasat just won a $450 million award for rapid migration of airborne networking equipment from GSA.
"This stock is thinly traded, I would not expect much action in the AH session. But if the ER is really good, things could really percolate strongly to the upside tomorrow, IMO. :-) Few more minutes and we shall see... :-)"
Hello VSAT - done anything productive this week? Created any shareholder value? Impressed customers or media with something new and exciting? No...Just slowly fading into the background...

Data metrics show significant increase in exploratory rigs over the last year in the Permian. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musks-spacex-plans-natural-gas-drilling-in-texas-report-2021-01-22https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/600f1dd8a0d7095882f1c730/960x0.jpg?fit=scaleWe met with AST & Science CFO AND COO Tom Severson.He explained that they are working on creating a network of satellites that will make it possible to have cell phone service anywhere in the world, including on planes or in the middle of the ocean.That manufacturing will be done at the Midland Space Port Business Park and create jobs for local workers.“Naysayers in Midland want to talk about space tourism as laughable and compare it to The Jetsons or Star Wars,” Blong said. “Before we’re ready to launch people into space, we have the opportunity to launch satellites for commercial use. That’s a viable economic opportunity that we have today.”The Midland Development Corporation couldn’t reveal details, but said more exciting opportunities are on the horizon for the space port.Soooooooo to continueVSAT now owns RNET. RNET is the dominant industry leader in floating development rigs. floating in this case means not fixed and operational but exploratory floating, looking, in this case floating around the surface of the Permian Basin. So Rignet through its Intellie S/W is the heart of the network IT within an exploratory rig and on the vast set of devlopmental rigs around the world. All the info from that enterprise for Rignet goes around and through to the ground locations of the various customers around the world for Rignet.Nice upper for Rignet. ViaSat key participation in a Space X launch system using Viasat Intellie system for LNG explortion. Long term VSAT access to a low cost launch system providerIn memory of Scott"
"Then add to the equation the bankruptcy of One Web and the likely end to Gogo, would be very surprised they can survive this downturn in the airlines for much longer. Since that is their entire business model."
VSAT is one of the best bet stocks. Many DOD contracts are being granted to VSAT. It can go above $50 when contracts are announced.
Viasat just awarded an $80 million contract for BFT-2.
Earnings will push it higher
"Anyone have any idea why this stock is getting beat up so badly? The continued price erosion doesn't seem justified considering the rebound they had last Q. As airfare becomes more normalized over the next few months, I can't imagine this will remain so subdued. I'm in at 32.08. Hope to see 34 by New Year!"
"James, the Starlink recent launch was the third such launch and the other two occurred in May and November, neither of these events or Musk's usual theatrics has impacted the stock previously, why do you believe this particular launch have any different of an outcome? Or are you really Elon and you are using the two billion that you got from diluting your shareholders from Tesla and trying to support your financially toppling empire of companies from going bankrupt by shorting companies. Kinda like what you did with Navistar, Cummins and Paccar before you announced your new battery operated Semis?"
"Well eventually reality will hit the Muskites once the tremendous bubble that is Tesla deflates. Then all of the shine from Tesla that is going over to Space X will disappear and just as those people will realize too late that a company that barely makes money and is quickly reaching the saturation point of demand for EVs in the largest car market isn't really worth as much as the ten largest auto manufacturers in the world combined. Just like the reality of the true cost of establishing a LEO network and even more so, maintaining that network will eventually price Space X out of the internet market."
"Shaggy, dropping on low volume? Huh? The volume today is already above the average and we still have 3 hours to go. This is a 52 week low on 2x of normal volume."
"Look at the 1 year chart for VSAT.The high for the past year ($97.31) was around May 19th or so. SpaceX did their their big launch for Starlink on May 24th.The market woke up at that point that a major competitor was coming and it will have a major impact long term on VSAT and other satellite service providers.SpaceX has a competitive advantage on launch costs, broadband speed and low latency. VSAT has fallen from $97 to $61 since then. And there is a lot more room to fall.Just my opinion. I am short this stock for the next few months."
VSAT is up 5.00% to 64.87
"Lots of shorts in this name, articles about space x putting them out of biz, looks like they will be covering in the 50s. Same thing happened to SPG, no shorting in this market"
I smell fish... VSAT works a deal for big blocks for $39.11 per share. I'm betting this thing is getting ready to blow to the upside. Tight float and solid business model.. I wouldn't rule out an offer at these levels. Somewhere in the $50-$55 per share range.
I bought it at 31.50 sold it at 49; bought it back few days ago with doubling my shares since they will be in good hand with UK and USA and possibility of 145 dollars in the long run since it's 35% undervalued compare to S&P. will catchup by the end of year or 2022.
"I am currently considering VSAT for a Pure Earnings Long play, for Thursday AH/Friday PM. Company is currently not profitable, but based on my analysis I think they could become profitable very soon, perhaps even this coming quarter. Company has a lot of growth potential, and I think the stock price could react very favorably to a positive and strong ER. I would welcome any thoughts or comments on this potential play. Other stocks I am considering for this date are ZEN as a Long, and WYNN and TDC as Sell Shorts. I am not finding many plays that look really good to me on this date. Right now, VSAT Long and WYNN short strike me as perhaps the best options. Any hidden gems out there that I might have missed?? Your suggestions are welcome and very much appreciated, folks! :-)"
"Yeah, Elon is in trouble. He is down to his last $43 billion at current prices. 20% of Tesla = only $25 billion and 54% of SpaceX is about $18 billion."
"So results are leaked and the price is dropping, okay, stay away from this one until after report."
VSAT reached a new 52 Week High at 78.77
Short this stock now is high risk!

Viasat is up 6.83% to 51.00
Dead money buy anything else
Interesting that the stock is trading down yet the report is helping GOGO and SATS share prices.
"Excellent company , it has a lot of time in the bottom, similar was GE, I think will be going to $70 easy and soon, the last Friday all the main executive had been reposition at low price"
I just jumped in for 500 shares..... looks like an easy 15% gain from this level given the beat down and long term will be much higher.
"If Gov of USA and UK are using the service for ground, sea and space with $vsat; and they have the contract with new NOC which are building with Cyber securities; then Starlink 2 is missing out big time."
VSAT reached a 52 Week low at 54.00
"Shaggy, that is amazing how you buy almost the low of the day, then sell the rally perfectly. Simply amazing. Care to take a screenshot to prove it and upload it anywhere?"
So you think it will go up tomorrow?
"Read yesterday's CC on Motley Doof. Margins, demand, capacity, productivity, revenue, EDITDA, backlog, all going up; capex spend, going down. No wonder its up 10% today. Longer term, competition is possible, but acquisition is probable."
"Furthermore, you tout the speed advantage of the low orbit Spacelink satellites over the high orbit satellites, so tell me how many low orbit satellites are required to equal the same coverage as a high orbit satellite? So do you imagine the satellites will transfer signals like cell towers to maintain consistent signals?"
VSAT is down -5.02% to 71.13
VSAT is down -5.02% to 63.26
Good thing I kept loading up every week the last 3 months $$$$$
"Huge beatViasat (VSAT) reported 3rd Quarter December 2019 earnings of $0.39 per share. The consensus estimate was a loss of $0.01 per share on revenue of $586.2 million.Huge beat on EPS, great earnings growth! This looks VERY nice for the upside tomorrow! :-)"
"VSAT must be desperate for new business if they are partnering with the NBA. That makes me nervous to partner with a sinking ship that has close ties with China, not to mention all the privileged players that think they walk on water, violate all the rules and yet the NBA does nothing."
