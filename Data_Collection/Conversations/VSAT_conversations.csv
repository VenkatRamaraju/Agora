"I've read the report, and it has some sense. Nobody cares about revenue if it makes 0 profit. the management is silent about debt repayment. Huge debts IMHO. it means Viasat will be unprofitable for many years even if Viasat-3 brings a lot of money. Mark should share his strategy and financial guidance openly (if he has any)."
"Out VSAT at $65.23 for a loss of just under $2.9k. Another failed Pure Earnings play, and my first Red week of the year. There will be more, I am quite certain. But the months and years are much more important than the weeks. I think I have an excellent chance of going and staying Green for the month of February, despite a bad start to the month. I gave this baby until 3:30 PM to perk up, but then had to unload her, to do my next play, Short 3200 shares of EPC at $30.69. EPC reports before market open on Monday, and I am looking for a poor ER, and a drop in the stock price to the $28 level. Best of Luck to All and enjoy the weekend! :-)"
"with more competition on the way (Starlink, Amazon, Echostar, etc.), what's the future of this company?"
Starlink just announced inflight Wifi. That could be the death blow to this stock.
Still holding up; the future is on our side!!!
there are obvious reasons why stock is falling. smart investors are trying to leave in time. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/viasats-existential-problem-mehdi-mehdiyev/
"I agree with Shaggy. Its not practical and Viasat will eat them for lunch in the marketplace. Viasat has beat earnings every quarter I have looked at them and now they are making a profit. In two years this stock by all analysts is going to be 140. SpaceX is going to be struggling financially, but making lots of inspirational news stories about the world of tomorrow. This reminds me of the struggle for fusion energy or robots, it is possible and it will probably happen someday, it was great science fiction when I was growing up, but its a lot harder to actually do it and make money and we dont have those things yet. Viasat is building there own GEO satellites, terminals, ground stations... Even if this LEOs are successful (which I find improbable), Viasat will make money regardless because it will be cheaper and they will have more customers.As far as SpaceX/WebX/Amazon and the media, I worked on LEO satellites for years and I worked on ONEWEB program until it went under the first time) Wall street, the media, and a lot of people have all drank the coolaid without knowing how difficult this is. Read the blogs from companies that specialize in phase array terminals. I am a microwave radio engineer and I know how stuff works and what they are promising is not practical in 2020 or even by 2025. Its a beautiful vision but the execution is going break them like so many dead companies on this path. Viasat is now world satellite leader for BW, and already has working terminals, customers, relationships with countries involved, distribution network and designs at a fraction of the cost of what any LEO ground terminal will cost. The reason for this is Viasat GEO system uses a fixed dish its very simple, LEOs user terminals will need 1 or 2 phased arrays or mechanical gimbles to track satellites, not to mention the upto 1 MILLION ground stations to support the satellites, Do the math a support ground terminal is going to cost 3000 or so minimum X 1 million thats 3 billion, every user terminal is going to cost 1000$ (very optimistic). Not to mention none of the LEO space hardware is working correctly, does not even have the optical links and it de-orbits so rapidly its going to cost a fortune to keep sky net up."
"So Elon and Space X decide to go big in frac drilling the permian basin to pursue derivative oil products for liquid/gel rocket fuel. All eyes turn to west Texas with the close proximity to the new . Data metrics show significant increase in exploratory rigs over the last year in the Permian. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musks-spacex-plans-natural-gas-drilling-in-texas-report-2021-01-22https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/600f1dd8a0d7095882f1c730/960x0.jpg?fit=scaleWe met with AST & Science CFO AND COO Tom Severson.He explained that they are working on creating a network of satellites that will make it possible to have cell phone service anywhere in the world, including on planes or in the middle of the ocean.That manufacturing will be done at the Midland Space Port Business Park and create jobs for local workers.“Naysayers in Midland want to talk about space tourism as laughable and compare it to The Jetsons or Star Wars,” Blong said. “Before we’re ready to launch people into space, we have the opportunity to launch satellites for commercial use. That’s a viable economic opportunity that we have today.”The Midland Development Corporation couldn’t reveal details, but said more exciting opportunities are on the horizon for the space port.Soooooooo to continueVSAT now owns RNET. RNET is the dominant industry leader in floating development rigs. floating in this case means not fixed and operational but exploratory floating, looking, in this case floating around the surface of the Permian Basin. So Rignet through its Intellie S/W is the heart of the network IT within an exploratory rig and on the vast set of devlopmental rigs around the world. All the info from that enterprise for Rignet goes around and through to the ground locations of the various customers around the world for Rignet.Nice upper for Rignet. ViaSat key participation in a Space X launch system using Viasat Intellie system for LNG explortion. Long term VSAT access to a low cost launch system providerIn memory of Scott"
"Being manipulated lower on Low volume and general fears of a market collapse? Cant imagine this is a justified drop in price. Remote work is increasing and need for Govt and rural satellite communication is a must. Will it become an AMZN subsidiary? I'm still adding, but it's not easy to be bullish when there's blood in the streets of Carlsbad. :O"
"I have finished researching my next Pure Earnings play, for Thurs AH/Fri PM, and in the end it came down to a head-to-head showdown between VSAT and FTNT. Both of these plays look very good to the upside, and choosing one over the other was very difficult. But I have done it, and I choose VSAT. Here is a brief rundown of my impressions and research analysis:VSAT: Very good Earnings History, EPS and Revenue beats for five consecutive quarters. Excellent stock reactions to earnings reports: 2 15+% pops in past 9 ER's. Growing revenue. Recent very positive news, USAF contract awarded. Analysts are bullish. Excellent and unanimous upside potential on PT's. Company not profitable last year, but is on the cusp and expected to become profitable this year. Financials are good, but not great. Stock is near a 52 week low, and there are good reasons to think this ER will not just beat, but beat solidly. A 7-12% upside move seems perfectly plausible, on a strong beat. FTNT: Outstanding Earnings History, 11 straight quarters of beats on both EPS and Revenue, a rare feat! Outstanding Guidance History, they have guided higher 9 of the last 12 quarters, even rarer a feat! Stock price reactions to earnings are very good, but slightly less than VSAT. Analysts are bullish, but upside potential near-term appears less than VSAT. Company profitable, slightly overvalued. Earnings this quarter might be under pressure due to two completed acquisitions. Excellent overall financials, slightly better than VSAT. The main reasons I am choosing VSAT over FTNT are: Better upside potential on a very good ER, and less downside risk of a big drop, if the ER is not that good. Of course this is all just my opinion and you should know that every Pure Earnings play carries the very real risk of a 10-20% loss of the capital you put into the trade. Best of Luck to All! :-)"

"Algorithms sense that $VSAT stock is close to support and consequently, might be a quick technical buy around the current priceYT"
"Read yesterday's CC on Motley Doof. Margins, demand, capacity, productivity, revenue, EDITDA, backlog, all going up; capex spend, going down. No wonder its up 10% today. Longer term, competition is possible, but acquisition is probable."
"I am currently considering VSAT for a Pure Earnings Long play, for Thursday AH/Friday PM. Company is currently not profitable, but based on my analysis I think they could become profitable very soon, perhaps even this coming quarter. Company has a lot of growth potential, and I think the stock price could react very favorably to a positive and strong ER. I would welcome any thoughts or comments on this potential play. Other stocks I am considering for this date are ZEN as a Long, and WYNN and TDC as Sell Shorts. I am not finding many plays that look really good to me on this date. Right now, VSAT Long and WYNN short strike me as perhaps the best options. Any hidden gems out there that I might have missed?? Your suggestions are welcome and very much appreciated, folks! :-)"
Dany missed the meeting... Everything must be on track stock is still up!
