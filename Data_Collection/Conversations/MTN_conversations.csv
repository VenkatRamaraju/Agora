What’s up with today’s volume?! Seems like a real bull vs. bear fight today. Are institutions desperately trying to keep this above $260?
here comes the boom
"Henry Ellenbogen at the 2019 Barron’s Roundtable: “For any durable company, there are times when the competitive moat gets tested. You can assess whether the business model has withstood the competition. We think Vail did, and will grow by double digits this year.”"
Normal if not better Xmas eve day at N*...not a hint of skier dropoff out here in CA. Everybody and their brother has already booked a trip to Whistler. Let's see Aspen (KSL) match that.
Link takes a position in MTN at 303???!!! The stock is at all time high. Why not at 129 back when everybody hated the stock??!! The best time to buy a stock is when you most won't want to. 303 is NOT the time to buy this stock. People on TV are such knuckle heads; never ceases to amaze me.
Why doesn’t it go up ?
Over $235 today
"time to buy stocks that benefit from low oil, low rates, high employment. and MTN quarter and quidance not as bad as it looks. I'm eyeing June calls. thoughts anyone?"
Be careful with this company. This season will be horrible. Who is going to vail when you are scared to go to the planes and restaurants. Skiing is safe but then you have to go inside to eat and hang around. The American public won’t have immunity until June. This season is finished
"from the customer perspective, I would NEVER buy this stock. I am a former ski instructor, would never work for this company. Their customer service is absolutely horrendous. And with the new system of making reservation to ski!! I ski when weather and snow conditions are best, how am I decide on dec 1 what days those will be."
"Another 2 feet of snow in the Sierra due tomorrow. MTNs resorts all open by 11/22, most earlier. Looking to be at least average, probably much better is my take. Whistler has 3 ft of base already."
Futures showing almost a 2 year low this morning on MTN. Stock getting crushed. Visitors down.
"Maybe it's something about this latest pass just announced, with more international, and larger Canadian presence."
Way way over-valued. Have you been to Vail recently? Should have bought at $150.
"My intel says Vail is having a hopping Xmas eve...7 inches of new. Stock move not related to weather, or ticket sales...everybody is showing up...sure...3 feet of powder would bring more, but they aren't hurting. Normal."
"Huge sell order in the final minute of trading, but put call trading was still bullish."
"why MTN trade at almost history high? Revenue in the last two quarters was down substantially, losing money, company dose provides a guideline for the next two quarters. do you think it can be good、Basicly, MTN belongs to COV19 victim stock like cruise, airline and casino."
Significant early weather system continues in Sierra. A buy.
"Can someone explain to me why this is trading near a 52wk high when it seems like nothing but bad news? 2019-2020 was a complete loss globally, credit for 2020-2021 pass holders, limiting daily ticket sales/mountain access for 2020-2021 season, little international and domestic travel and restrictions on mountain services (non skiing)...Am I missing something or people just buying now for what hopes to be a good 2022-2023 season?!"
The skiers will spend the money...it's just a matter of where; MTN provides the most choices...way too early to write of the season; It's only December 12. As if anyone really knows the weather more than 3 days in advance....it can't yet be called a dry season. Normal range of variation so far.
Why are we down 4% after hours before earnings in the morning? I didn't run up into earnings so was looking for spike on good earnings and forecast.
This is what happens when the CEO sells stock rather than run his business.
"I dont think its december weather. If anything, the market may be in a wait see mode after Aspen's recent acquisition of squaw-alpine, mammoth, and deer valley...they own steamboat and winter park as well, and Aspen of course. There's a recent article in Freeskier. I think its all better for the industry and not a competition. Aspen's resorts I think aren't quite as day trip accessible as MTN, so I don't see the latter's pass sales being hurt too much, Aspen has some very nice holdings. No effect on each other until next season pass sales, and it may be good for both big players. We'll see."
Here it comes. this stock is going to go way higher. - LC.
should pressure upward resistance around 245-250. a positive market into Q1 2020 should lead to break above 250 imo
"Whistler -or ""Vail North"" as people call it now, opened with its deepest base in 10 years, 55 inches, 39% open...the best in North America right now."
"Ron Baron, one of Vail’s largest shareholders, after their latest quarterly results: “As long-term investors, we do not view short-term price changes as necessarily reflecting changed business fundamentals. With Vail’s 3% dividend and 11.5x forward multiple, we believe Vail has a good chance of again doubling earnings in five to seven years and well over doubling its share price in that same time frame.”"
Vail Resorts (MTN) Reports Q1 Larger Loss and Misses Revenue Estimates
they should beat the quarter easily imo. question is for me how can they possibly guide higher??
April calls working people!!
"Wxmaps 10 day forecasts indicate another huge dump, 400% of normal, on top of MTNs sierra and whistler resorts, as well as negative temperature anomalies in Colorado. Visitation will be very strong. Easy money."
Have a big gain on this company from a few years ago. This is a solid reopening play. The time to buy if you're not involved yet is now. The number of visitors to their ski resorts will pick up dramatically as the economy reopens. There is obviously a seasonality to their business but the quarter today likely reflects optimism about reopening. More skiers=more revenue. Long.
Nowhere to go but down. Going to test its previous lows in the $20s.
"Not a chance to lose $. This industry has highly variable employment cost structure that allow them 2 ratchet back, or up, with seasonals. And it will snow. And it is, at Whistler and Stowe. And they can make snow. And they have had great past success in dry years. The season hasn't really started either. The stock may sell further, but it isn't yet a weather issue, and probably won't be."
Financials look exceptionally beefed up. Does this have anything to do with the abrupt exit of the Chief Accounting Officer (who used to be a director of accounting at Enron) in October?
Solid movement over the past two days. Hopefully they can carry this momentum into earnings.
I could see this stock falling a minimum 30%. It is over valued in every sense. I expect sell recommendations forthcoming.
glad I sold at $301.50 a few months back.....I thought it was looking to take a fall
Wow down $33.
"I just threw 10K at this...betting on continued early el nino pattern snow in Rockies will help Epic more than Ikon, but who really knows?"
Park CIty announced no more than 50 people allowed anywhere till end of year. Who would book park city mountain resort now?
Waiting till it drops under 200 for possible buy and with zero snow until at least January 5 think we can get there!!
People getting turned away at resorts in CO due to full parking lots. The low holiday turnout will be made up for in Q3.I'm loading up on MTN.
next earnings going to be a disaster.....this will be a $150 stock
45 inches of base already at MTNs Park City. Lodging very tight. Expect strong Q2 revenues.
Short covering to take advantage of tax loss before years end? Certainly not because the stock or company are suddenly showing stellar performance.Be interesting to see what happens here in January...
Where's my Dividend?!!!
"Any possibility they are raising money to purchase other ski resorts that are in way worse situation than themselves and strengthening their monopoly? I hold puts on this resort for now but can see this stock move higher as soon as we are getting out of the covid era. However, skiing this season is a total waste of time!!"
"Here's the way I see it in the ski industry as I have been in it for 41 years. If the resorts plan to open at all, all the employees will be tested to make sure they are not positive.But everybody else coming into the resorts will not be unless they are required to be. The public will want to be guaranteed the employees are clean, but there's no guarantee the employees won't catch it because the visitors will possibly be dirty. Can you imagine being in a ski school where you are in such close contact with students? Or any other activity at a resort.I believe the only way out of this is for nationwide vaccinations and testing. We have 8 months and the clock is ticking. Right now, we have not moved 1"" forward since early march when this began."
hoping earnings is a breakout and we see good projections moving forward
This will crash. Please tread carefully.
"Nice report. Too the moon, Alice."
"And now the stock is going up...also on no news...the NOAA La Nina update was in November, with the next one due January 11. At which time the resorts will all have 3 feet of base and a full boat. And this stock will likely be at 230 if not higher."
"Whistler Blackcomb and Stevens Pass are their only resorts with good conditions. The snowfall, forecasts and open terrain at all of their Colorado, Utah, California and Eastern resorts are terrible. It's going to be an ugly December for Vail. They might want to upsize the convertible debt financing to $1B!"
It is selling at 19X EBITDA. It has topped out on growth as it now has a major competitor - so it isn't a growth stock. It is a capital intensive business.... Capital intensive businesses sell at 8X EBITDA. Why
"Again, will air travel be anywhere near the levels of 2017, 2018, 2019 this XMAS and Jan 2021? If not, this stock goes nowhere."
"Cititzens required to covid test for re enter into usa, highest daily death toll, new variant, stock dilution, bond offerings, cruises being canceled..... yet rcl and $mtn still seem unphased."
Utah and Colorado MTN resorts: 12 lifts open out of 85.....global warming his here!
"Decided after much thought to sell my 100 shares of MTN that I have been holding for many years. It was hard, but I got $280.18 a share. Working in the ski industry for 30 years and listening to conference call its just obvious to me that Vail Resorts is for now in the new covid world going to see substantial loss in revenue for the foreseeable future. No complaints, I did extremely well on my investment. Best of luck to the longs here, I will be back in the future just thing too much risk at these levels I've seen mtn crash hard last year Don want to go thru that again."
Vail has total screwed their customer base this year and if you think earnings are bad you have seen nothing yet to come. Hold on to your seats and by the Vail i want my money back for a pass that i cant use sine the VT Gov has shut the borders down and NO i do not want to go to Hunter !!! told American Express that i would not pay for a pass i could not use!!!! So good luck fighting American Express and no i do not want a credit for next year!!!! Stop screwing your customer base!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why down so much?Should be up
Why would MTN pay double the going rate for a struggling Skis?
earnings is gonna be a blowout boys. Colorado has been getting great snow
"FYI, Whistler lodging almost sold out for all of January and February 2018, and its nonrefundable. All those people bought epic pases, or will buy daily tickets at a couple hundo Canadian per day. Cha ching."
"HUGE LOSS, HUGE DECLINE IN REVENUES - Should go up over $300 tomorrow!"
"I think the season is done this year. Unfortunately, this stock is way overpriced"
"Their day passes were way overpriced so its probably a good move. Their season passes are still reasonable. I think they might get less revenue in the short term, but they're swallowing up so many resorts that it wont matter because eventually theyre going to own practically everything."
time to pick up April atm calls for earnings run up???
What did they know and when did they know it?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-were-selling-vail-141716120.html
lots of investors buy in advance of earnings. I did; its a bit if a no brainer given this is the first full season with whistler for preseason pass sales. Should beat on revenues. We'll see. I don't see another major acquisition near term.
Good honest read from Moody's and their decision to lower MTN credit ratinghttps://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-Vail-Resorts-CFR-of-Ba3-CFR-senior-unsecured--PR_423812
"No snow, no Travel, no revenue, no profits... no problem"
If anybody wants any insider info I live in whistler and work in the hospitality industry . From what I’ve been hearing from my employer I won’t be going back to work until December .
Mtn- look at the balance sheet!! Omg
"More debt, less cash, more obligations. Recent acquisitions purchased at top of the market. We're at peak season pass sales. Epic pass holders realizing bait and switch with over crowding and resort gouging. They killed their day lift business across the board. Cap ex underestimated. Stock institutionally over bought. They are selling now. None of this has to do with snow on the ground or global warming which is an entirely different risk. Vail insiders have been selling with both hands during the ascent."
Season passes still somewhat reasonable but lift tickets in Colorado for single days are insanity. $200/day at Vail/Beaver creek. $175 Keystone/Breck. Who would pay that?
what caused this massive drop when it wasn't earnings ?
"Buying MTN is simply a bet that a vaccine will be widely distributed by December. Sure, locals will ski if the slopes are open, but air travel will by way down next season unless a vaccine hits. Hard to make money if only the locals are skiing."
"As I sit here in CA, freezing my aath off in an obviously early fall day, I wonder what the heck anyone is thinking selling MTN...then...just a little research shows it being sold off with other entertainment related to the Mandolay shooting. Hello, computer algorithms, a ski hill is not Las Vegas. This will reverse by end of week for anyone interested in a quick buck."
"Before Christmas was less than expected, but it seems post Christmas has been higher than expected with a 12% increase in lift tickets and increase in all other product lines. Also the good snow season should help for the remained of the year. I wouldn’t be surprised if they still make their targeted guidance range this year from a better than expected 2nd half of the season"
Just checked with a friend who recently moved to Vail. Said conditions aren’t great and the mountain is empty.Xmas and NYE were the highlight of the season in terms of traffic and now it’s just deadsville.
"I have been holding MTN since 2017. What a ride for the past several months! still keeping it in my portfolio given a lot of upside!07:45 AM EDT, 06/05/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Vail Resorts (MTN) has an average analyst rating of buy, with an average price target of $226.Price: 206.97, Change: +4.99, Percent Change: +2.47http://www.mtnewswires.com Copyright  2020 MT Newswires."
5-6 feet of snow predicted this week in MTNs California resorts - Northstar/Heavenly/Kirkwood; buy buy buy!!!
"I added to position at 275, I look for a recovery after the CC. Lots of snow is what matters most to MTN, wait for winter results and meanwhile enjoy the nice dividend."
"Northstar, Lake Tahoe over the weekend was packed. Parking lots were full and saw a lot of tourists paying to use the gondola. This last storm in the West should help Vail Resorts bring back those numbers!!"
"Snow bases look OK everywhere except Sierra, and fresh snow this past week in #$%$ a 3ft+ base is encouraging. WB has been more consistent."
so you know all vail resorts in California are packed to the gills record number for Tahoe and kirkwood
"Are the shareholders aware of the major transition problems...Many Many Many season pass holders who switched from Peak to Epic haven't received passes; all phones at Vail report ""technical difficulties""..seems to be across the board...Hunter Mnt has looonnngggg lines ..not for the chair lifts..but for the season pass holders to get daily tickets printed...All employees use canned response ""It's not us it's Vail...""....Has been an issue with no solution for weeks and weeks and weeks ..no answers for the pass holders..no answers for the shareholders...no accountability.....just a recording..If this is across the board (as we have been told at Hunter) it will affect the bottom line......"
Nice dividend and NO China exposure. Figured this would be a rotation stock out of those with China risks.
think it's time to sell bought 180 at least selling half
2-3 ft of snow coming at the peaks this wed-thur around Tahoe...could be better...but better than a start for sure.
"Bought this stock way back in the day @ $12 a share since I worked in ski industry, along with American ski company and head which both flopped. Still in the industry all these years later and obviously killed it on mtn by sheer luck. My sincere question since being.in the industry I know this is a bad season for retail as well as resorts due to lack of snow/cold weather is do i consider for near term selling my position before the pending conference call in March ? My thinking is this could drop this season solely due to the poor weather this year. Then buy back in say during the summer at a potentially big discount. Anyone else holding considering the same thing ? I've talked to so many people that are very in tune with the industry and the overall outlook this season is bleak. Still love the company long term, but wouldnt mind getting more shares down the road for free basically if the feedback is accurate. Thoughts ?"
"Absolutely crazy action on this the past 2 days. Up 7.5% on NO NEWS (other than more negative news about more covid cases, and increasing likelihood of significant shutdowns. Assuming Biden wins, I imagine there will be further shutting down of the economy. Does not bode well for this stock. Stock is not HIGHER than it was before the pandemic hit. They had to give out 20% season pass discounts to make up for last season. Imagine the significant restrictions on lifts, which has to cut capacity big time. Also, the big drop in customers flying in and staying at the resorts has to be huge. Company had to borrow at 6.5% to sustain operations. The economy is in the tank, the demographics on this sport are challenging, there is always the wild card of snow, and we are facing a big second wave this winter with no prospect of a vaccine this season. Yet this stock rockets up every day. Who is buying at this level? I am short but confess I must be missing something here. I grant you this is likely to eventually recover post-vaccine,but that could be 2 long years off, with lots of red ink in between. Please someone educate me on what I am missing here."
"It looks late compared to last year, but it isn't really. I skied Kirkwood over a week ago and it had ALOT of terrain open; very few rocks. Whistler shows 119 runs open, and still has a meter of base despite recent rain/warm weather; and its below freezing. The high pressure system will begin to weaken this weekend; and dumps to return just before Xmas and continue thereafter. It's a weak La Nina...this still normal at this point. What's not normal, however, is the step back in MTN share price. I am holding the remainder of my shares no matter what; and might buy more if the price warrants it, in the next few days. Whistler alone, with its huge lodign capacity, could recoup much of what could otherwise be a weak season -but I don't think it is. At least Canada and VT will get the snow. Alot of it. My trip to Whistler (1st time) is booked for mid-January."
Dividend next week. I like getting paid to wait.
"No air travel, no snow, no problem.!"
recent article from Vail Daily approaching historic drought at Vailhttps://www.vaildaily.com/news/drought-conditions-persist-in-vail-valley-and-across-most-of-the-western-slope/
Earnings call at 11:30 am - will see whether there's a further confirmation of the earlier trading.
Down $25 AH. Does anyone know if there is some news?
"MTN just added Telluride to next year's pass. New pass options are 4, 7, and unlimited nonlocal days. Prices not announced yet. Sierra still thin cover after last week's snow."
"$500,000,000 private debt due in 5 years. This company is running out of cash, and this is an act of desperation."
Lots of support at $271-274. Hope it holds or no telling how far we can drop. Anyone buying on this dip?
ps. the insiders who know the financial issues are steadily selling....not a good sign
"Has anyone done the math on the some 80,000 to 100,000 claims being processed by American Claims Management (the insurance carrier of Epic Pass)? What games and manipulation are at play when ACM pays out on insurance in lieu of a refund by Vail Resorts? Funneling claims via insurance keeps losses off of Vail Resorts Books...so, they book revenue when they sell a pass, but what about when ACM pays out a refund? There is a lot of information on social media that paint a different picture from unhappy customers who purchased passes for 20/21. Vail Resorts has never addressed any of the concerns and hides behind their lawyers and $11B market cap...while pumping out information to make investors happy and line their own pockets with bonuses..."
"this year’s early season condition is among the best in recent memory. Beck bowls opened in early Dec, which has not happened for quite a while. It still can’t get people coming, suggesting excessive high price is killing the industry. I just come back from park city, a burg costs almost $20 on mountain and it is not a good burg! A lunch costs $40-50 if you add a beer and a side. I haven’t mention lift ticket and other expense. I talked a few who live in SLC, they told me they stopped sking because of high price."
Vail Resorts is up 8.19% to 184.77
"FYI: Andy finally admitted he was wrong. In addition to owning stock, I buy the most expensive, unrestricted, Epic Pass, to all of Vail's resorts. Now that the snow base is set for the season, and clear and colder weather is predicted for the next 7-10 days, expect about 1,000 extra tickets plus incidentals per resort per day, minimum, with much more on weekends like this. Millions/day of extra revenue. Stock should hit 180 in 2 weeks or less."
"Vail Resorts beats by $0.18, misses on revenueSep. 28, 2018 6:50 AM•Niloofer ShaikhVail Resorts (NYSE:MTN): Q4 GAAP EPS of -$2.07 beats by $0.18.Revenue of $211.64M (+1.2% Y/Y) misses by $1.69M."
Should be $100/share
It only takes few thousand to bring up the price of stocks. It takes more to bring down price. It is expensive now at up 5% today. When I checked last night Yahoo had the price dropping 8.14%. P/E is over 240. I smell something fishy
Liquidity isn’t going to save this insolvent company. Released metrics confirm it.
$185 is a reasonable valuation.
"American ski industry is in suicide mode. In addition to ever declining ski population and global warming, the cost of ski has become prohibited high for 99% of population. The epic pass looks cheap compare to day pass, but it can only attract hardcore skiers who plan way ahead of time. Their population are very limited. Those who may spend a few days in slope have been totally shut down by terribly high lift prices. This basically kills coming of new skiers. Lift is only a part of cost. The other parts are even more expensive. If you search lodge price in Vail village in Jan, which is low season, you won't be able to find a hotel room for less than $500. A couple of years ago I was in Vail during Christmas-New Year week, I was shocked by how deadly quiet of the village center was. Few can afford the hefty price of hotel rooms, I finally realized."
you boys ready for this thing to bump hard?
It was at 186 this morning almost 10% up? Any idea why or what happened? It seems like then suddenly came back to earth. Curious if there was some type of news out there?
Snow fall in Colorado is LOW.. Causing even more people to forgo a trip to the mountains. Its hard to spend 200$ for a day ticket with none of the hoopla open- atleast you can bomb down the mountain as there are less people.
Will pass through $200...Vail and Park City are ghost towns!
Cancelled my reservations due to virus paranoia
Your statement is factually incorrect. Purchase price $1.39 billion not $1.06 billion. MTN had $74 million in the bank at the end of the last quarter. It does not have $513 million in cash.
Convertible debt offering for $500M. I wonder why they did this with interest rates at all-time lows?
"Poor metrics released today by Vail Resorts and the stock price isn’t collapsing like I’d expect. At some point it will decline quite a bit. Wall Street is looking past current year’s miserable numbers and hoping for good numbers next year but don’t expect next year to rebound much because Online chatter is abound with extremely poor customer service & many customers they are upsetting have said they will not be be buying passes next year. Instead of building goodwill right now to leverage that into a great year next year, Vail is angering their customer base and I believe hurting future growth. Focus only on today’s bottom line and you fail to have a future. They don’t see the forest through the trees."
"Looks like MTN is having a fall clearance sale! Get your shares now at these low, low prices as the deal won't last!!"
250 after earnings
"Shareholder just got done listening to the live conference call. Overall, honestly feeling nervous in terms of the 2021 fiscal year as a whole listening to the potential significant lost revenue in Vermont as well as Whistler and other resorts due to the travel restrictions. Since I am probably the only one who listened to it, ill just keep my personal opinions to myself. Started buying this stock over 20 years ago so I'm no stranger to this company. Overall, quarter wasn't the best and hate when they dodge forward guidance and not give any. Feel like im skiing in the dark lol."
"This news of discounts too passholders seems desperate and just a reaction too alterra. Huge debt, pass sales will be lower. Going short"
"Too many headwinds here. Obviously travel will be way down this season, which hurts revenue big time since out of state guests bring in disproportionate revenue. Season passes have to be affected due to travel and operational concerns. Capacity of lifts etc likely to be significantly reduced. How many people will want to take that chance? Then you have the usual snow concerns along with the fact that they discounted passes 20%. Plus they took on $500m debt at a whopping 6.5%. Bleeding red ink and time not on their side. So this season is a write off and they are reduced to waiting for the 21/22 season. Meanwhile debt and deferred maintenance piles up. Stock is just about back to precious levels which makes no sense. I think they will survive and build back their revenue stream but will take some time. This stock should be around $180. Way overbought. Next quarter will be another miss and I look for reality on this to set in after the election."
Ski season coming up. Enjoy the ride.
she's going hard in the paint
I'm surprised MTN share price has done so well over the last few months considering the lockdowns affect their resorts.
Any views on MTN booking asset or goodwill impairments this year?
"Skiers have plenty of money and there are lots of them...go wait in line for fresh tracks at WB or Vail some day and post again. Pass cost is almost irrelevant, given that it is almost covered in a week's trip. Vail or Ikon could charge anything. 1000s of Australians live in WB all winter."
"what did I tell you! Is that not why you are here? Still some money to be made with a buy today on the big dump before the holiday weekend. Talk about a rain errr, snow maker."
"CRAZY INSANE BARGAIN TODAY 1/12 ON MTN!!! ROADS CLEAR, HUGE SINGLE TICKET SALES LIKELY AFTER 10 YEAR STORM OUT WEST!!!!!"
Prediction: MTN will announce they’re reinstating the dividend in the next earnings call.
"Well...so much for expert advice. My advice, however, do not own a stock that is going to report their earnings. It will go down for the most convoluted reasons. It's going XD in January. I'll take a look at this then."
"broke above my last sale price of 230...240 in sight...much higher if weather turns in Sierra, but it hasn't yet."
"Clueless Andy forgets about growth and dividend; this company has no comparable in the industry, and isn't to be compared to cruise ships and casinos and the like. Buy or be left in the dust."
"Public Service Announcement: Lack of snow slows Vail Resorts’ revenue stream""Katz said seasonal snowfall in November and December in Vail, Beaver Creek and Park City, Utah was the lowest recorded in more than 30 years.""""In December, Vail Resorts told investors to expect between $646 million and $676 million in resort earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, with net income between $264 million and $300 million.

"Absolutely ridiculous that any investment firms would ""raise"" or ""keep"" price targets, given such a miss and no forecast. One should read CFRA's report keeping their price target at $300. Just a snippet, but they dropped FY22 EPS to $2.28 from $6.28. Such a joke."
"Steven, what's your outlook on MTN? The past two earnings it appears a big player has been buying shares to push up price only to dump the next day. Also, it's been trading over a PE of 40, which seems to be the prior support for this stock."
Picked up a nice lot @ 202I think we'll see MTN hit 230 tomorrow Good luck y'all

"It's not that much snow coming...but there's something else about with today's move...another acquisition, perhaps? I hope it's a resort with quality steeps, like Copper or Snow Basin."
"Expect another -33% just on the P/E falling in a major bear market. If its E falls too, the drop will be even greater."
This was partially offset by $15.4 million courtesy of lift revenues related to the expiration of the Credit Offerin other words we took the customers money but gave them nothing for it!!!!!In other words we screwed our customers!!!
They reported that some resorts would remain open until mid July due to amount of snow.. Should make for a great spring..
It is one season..not the end of the world.
Lift Lines Today at Breckenridge We’re Miserably Long. The shortest lines were a minimum of 15-20 minutes just for a 30 second ride while the longest reached 45 minutes to an hour!
Collecting newly increased dividend in 10 days. I like getting paid to wait.
"missed by a penny, but revenues still up 9% YOY. Overreaction and then some. Will be back up to $300 and more if weather continues to cooperate."
"I think different. Tested its near 52 week low. Bought on 12-24-18. Bounced off tested low many times today and held. Do not think spending on skiing is going to go down, but up."
"Covid-19 is just getting started and $MTN is screwed. The onky thing holding it up is the high dividends and with the E crashing I'd expect that to be slashed real soon. With that and the high P/E, I see a relatively quick 50% decline."
"The summer here in Colorado has been great. Lots of new residents and plenty of tourists enjoying this amazing place. This is directional to Vail's revenue, helping it become a year round brand. I enjoy adding MTN shares as often as I can."
Ooh looks like a nice oversold bounce set up. I’ll be watching this Monday
Back to $250 with green markets
Where's the earnings report? Anyone?
Whistler and Blackcomb mountains just got shut down for the next 3 weeks due to covid. Ouch!
Driest Snow Year at Vail since 79 and very little sign of change....just saying...stock price dropping like a rock...no traffic out of denver during holidays for skiing
"I'm a long time Hunter skier (40+ yrs) Bob Katz and his troupe have really screwed up the Northeast with their way of doing things. We out here are the ""SnowMaking Capitol of the World"" that's how it's done! If he were to just keep his idiotic self out of the way Hunter would be doing fine (it sells out every weekend) but no, minimal snowmaking heck it's been below freezing now for ten days! I hate to say it, but Hunter will be hard pressed to stay open after St Paddy's day. Very low value for us skiers here. Russ Colten is also to blame for this, he should be voicing he's concerns to them instead of hiding in his office!!!!!!"
will Vail EVER bring back the div ?
"Here is my guess about what is going on. Vail is going to issue stock as a private placement at a discount to the current price. Since there are no real buyers for this stock, they are trying to pump it up before the dilution."
No tariff concerns here.
"I stand by my post. PCMR revenue, as with other MTN resorts, relies on February, not December, which is always s iffy. Normal I say. BTW, making snow doesn't necessarily use water, like watering crops, and is mainly an early season activity, like it is now. MTN got PCMR for a song, $158m if memory serves, and it pretty much paid for itself last season."
Out of curiosity I looked this stock up....holy cow....all time highs....in the mist of COVID and 2 back to back massive money losing seasons....Market is definitely awash in money.
230 here we come
I will probably rebuy on the earnings miss...depending on the price. I last sold at 232 or so.
I just acquired 5k shares of MTN priced among 206 to 215 per share. I believe this stock can go $300 in a year. A little dry on snow is not a big problem. Many ppl booked in advanced before knowing the whether. I think they will have a record year.
"cooling temps beginning 1/10 to dump 2 feet of goodness onto MTNs sierra resorts. Rockies and Utah resorts colder, and more snow on way too. Shaping up for best MLK holiday weekend in a decade. Just sayin."
"What a difference a month makes.  A “certain someone” posted this about MTN in April:“you are so wrong...GILD and Trump will not be your savior. The economy is in the tank. This after out VS share price increase is a market looking for any hop it can find! Good luck nimrod..your investments are good as toast..speaking of which, you should take the money you invested here and burn it I. A bonfire, it would have resulted in more benefit to you than this investment will!”"
All this talk about what the weather will be like over the next few months makes me wonder whether people here are considering all the risks. 30x forward earnings for a cyclical stock this late in the economic cycle? PASS
"In addition to poor financial results, high leverage and frustrated customers, MTN seems to be challenged with public labor struggles recently. - Ski patrollers at Park City held a public rally this weekend to gain support for their contract negotiations.-Patrollers walk-out/""work exclusion"" caused a 3-day closure at Hunter Mountain earlier in Jan. (Vail's communication on this issue has been vague)-$100M lawsuit alleging violations of labor laws for not paying employees for all hours worked.Labor risks could be significant if they result in a major resort closure. At minimum I would expect that trends like this put upward pressure on labor costs."
Just a matter of time before they suspend dividend
"I almost bought an epic pass on the offer of 10 ""buddy passes "".Luckily I checked the details -a buddy pass is form of discount coupon requiring a substantial payment.This offer is a scam in my opinion-makes me wonder about the whole company .I will avoid their properties in the future."
Surprised they didn't raise guidance with all the Great weather at their prime resorts Think they are setting things up for a nice increase next qtr Nice dividend increase Hopefully this stays positive today!!
New high was a bit too high for me. A nice run up but I sold out.
"I was just at Vail and Beaver Creek, and business is brisk, to the extent Vail Resorts allows, limiting guests to about half capacity. Planes to Eagle are booked solid, hotels/condos doing OK...this 25% indoor seating limit per Colorado state is a bit rugged to deal with, especially on windy days. Brrr."
"So, lets put some numbers to this. Assume a 10% dilution, that $30 which is about the same as the stock has risen lately. MTNs market maker is clearly trying to keep this at around 300. Assume they place the shares at around 200-225. Now, if the stock falls to 250 or so, now its a bargain? Right. So, real buyers in the open market are available to dump the newly placed shared onto. Brilliant!"
There is so much new snow in Tahoe and Colorado!! It's going to be a great January & February for Vail Resorts Inc. Should see this stock above 200 by the end of February or sooner.
"If you’re thinking of opening a position in Vail, it’s already too late. On the other hand, all the outdoor and recreational plays (like last year) may be the way to go heading into Spring ad we are still dealing with growing covid cases."
"Got some new snow in Vail!! The locals are psyched, the tourists are happy and revenue is flowing through the corporate office. It's not going to finish as an epic season, but I'm buying at this dip for the long run. MTN has more acquisition plans and their summer revenue will only continue to grow."
Weather doesn't look to favor ski this season.
How do you guys feel long term on Vail?
"It finally started precipitating in the West coast today, for all of you guessing and betting on the snow year."
"Earnings and pass sales numbers 12/7, tomorrow. Exceptional early season visitation at Whistler since 11/17 opening, and Kirkwood on 12/5."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-vail-resorts-mtn-down-163004430.html
New competitive Ikon Pass does not seem to have affected stock price. www.ikonpass.com
"i sold out all my shares - Just incredible that the price is over $200/share. I will want to buy back, but this price of $275 is just incredible. Anyone with thoughts? Even if COVID is cured, I cannot fathom today's price of MTN."
There are lots of concerns that Vail Resorts are incurring lots of deferred maintenance on various propertiesaccording to various s residents. Does anyone know if Vail Resorts accrues this expense? It has to be a big number.
"Just an insane mob of skiers this weekend at MTNs Heavenly this Saturday, and not just passholders, many with full price window tickets. Stock is bulletproof right now."
"Stowe is getting DECIMATED, this coming weekend will be a total Bust, Rain followed by extreme cold."
Looks like $200 is coming!
glad I sold MTN @ $301.50...I thought it was looking toppy
And yet it keeps going up? Is something happening under the radar? Does covid prefer lower altitudes? Is the snow going to be made with bleach? 52 week high for a business that relies on out of state vacationers? I don’t ski but I’d love to know the logic behind this company valuation.
"umm yahh: all time high, 180 iminent, as roads clear out west from 10 more feet of snow last weekend. Cha ching!"
let me guess... earnings leak
My gut tells me skiing and ski trips will be what golfing and camping was this summer. People aren’t going to go down south or on cruises so maybe they’ll go on ski trips or buy a membership instead? Maybe evenLots of people who are new to the sport.
How long before the earnings crash and the dividend is reduced? The high dividend is the only thing holding up the stock or the current decline would be much worse..
Is it just me or does today’s announcement seem like just more lost revenue? Trying to figure out why it’s reacting so positively to today’s news...
"The ski is going to hit the fan for MTN...Ugly Fall in progress low sales, staycations all combine for super bad season dynamics and super negative attendance. Epic passes gonna be way down and expenses way up."
Convertible debt priced with 0% coupon and a conversion price of $407.
"So , earnings are better than last year and better than this year's estimate"
"While this conversation has degraded into fresh lows due to incoherent accusations by 'John' about something involving small insider sales, first significant snow fell in the Sierra yesterday, more predicted later this week, and an early opening of MTNs Northstar on 11/17. Meanwhile the stock fully recovered from a small dip to all time highs. Looking good."
It takes one month after the vaccine to gain immunity. The snow season this year will be over. The majority of Americans won’t be immunised until April and may
Vail just gave themselves a free ebitda pump next season. The year over year ebitda growth is going to be ridiculous next year. This is clear cut sandbagging.
Heavenly and Kirkwood were crazy packed over the weekend. This amazing storm on the west coast is going to turn things around for Vail Resorts!!
the North East is going to get 3 inches of rain Thursday and Friday. that is a fortune in snowmaking going right down the drain. how many millions of dollars are just going to be washed away.
"For all those who are saying this stock is getting pushed down bc of a mild snow fall year hasn't been out skiing. I've been to Park City, Vail, Breck, and Jackson Hole (even though it's not a Vail resort) this season and every place had long lift lines from the base to mid mountain, lodging that was hard to find if you waited to book a decent room, restaurants on and off the mountain with long waits or often times no reservations available at all. The snow might be bad but people are still showing up and spending money. I bought some on the pull back around $208 and my only regret is not having more buying power, bc in my opinion this stock is still cheap at $226"
"Two things.The first applies to all companies in the travel and leisure sector. These are the numbers we get to compare to next year. If you believe there's zero chance of recovery then you probably don't care. But if you believe this sector and these companies will recover, the comps next year are going to look nice.The second I believe to be a big differentiator of MTN to the rest of the sector. That is ""asset quality."" Vail resorts are ""premium"" locations throughout the continent. Locations and infrastructure that can command a pretty price tag. Locations and infrastructure that currently support and can evolve for a plethora of applications. And Vail Resorts is uniquely positioned within the sector to continue to acquire (growth) these quality assets (particularly if there's any fire-sales during a pandemic?)."
"This stock is gonna get slaughtered. a 37 PE with most metrics down year over year. Poor snow totals. Dining Revenue, Retail, Rental Revenue, skier visits all down year over year..... Doesn't look good."
Revenue 267 mil vs 257 estimate. last year was 220 million.
sold at 249 prior to exdate. gonna pick some more up in the low 240's
"Today’s announcement, smart move strategically or act of desperation?"
"I just want to highlight this post from April one more time, for posterity. Call it a teachable moment.“you are so wrong...GILD and Trump will not be your savior. The economy is in the tank. This after out VS share price increase is a market looking for any hop it can find! Good luck nimrod..your investments are good as toast..speaking of which, you should take the money you invested here and burn it I. A bonfire, it would have resulted in more benefit to you than this investment will!”Mental mistake #1 - A recovery in the stock market is independent from the competence of the Trump administration’s coronavirus response.Mental mistake #2 - Remdesivir has proven effective, but that’s just one data point. Vaccines are on the horizon, and several mortality-reducing treatments are emerging. This was predictable. The stock market didn’t need a “savior”. Binary thinking is deadlier for your financial health than any virus."
"Andy is either out of his mind, has a large short position, or both. Tough luck for you brother; this stock hasn't touched it's 200 EMA in years, and anything close to the 50 EMA is a buying opportunity. I'm not selling a dime until at least 180, and I may not then either. And another thing, lower-elevation Keystone, normally a second tier to Breckenridge, is getting more snow than any of Vail's resorts. Vail holds a lot of rooms there and will round out the killing their making this year in the industry."
"Vail just announced they?re closing all resorts as of today due to CV19 and apparently not refunding patrons. Expect blowback from skiers/snowboarders, many of whom are already #$%$ at Vail for jacking up prices and gouging. For anyone who isn?t old enough to remember what happened to the ski industry in the late 80?s, remember that skiing is a luxury. If you?re an avg Joe and the economy falters and you lose your job, are you going to shell out thousands to go skiing?"
The canadian border to remain closed sez Justin Trudeau until US has covid-19 under control......I remember last season WB had a discouraging lack of snow early season and that as I was told was the main reason the SP lagged last year. Now with no Americans dropping coin there.....The price of this stock baffles me. I get it that this season is a write- off and all but it is gonna be bad.....really bad for this company in many other ways than how I described above.Maybe I'm wrong.....I'm just an average joe investor
No big snow in the present forecast for maybe an inch or two this upcoming weekendhttps://www.vail.com/the-mountain/mountain-conditions/snow-and-weather-report.aspx
This stock will get killed today. Pulled 2020 guidance
"By all means stay bullish on this stock but MTN hasn't closed above the 20 day MA since 11/24. Furthermore, on the weeklies the stock showed incredible strength and momentum when it closed above the 20 week MA from mid 2016 until a few weeks ago. A really nice move. This week is setting up to be the 3rd in a row under the 20 since the uptrend was broken and a weekly close under 213 is quite bearish...There is no snow in the forecast for ten days throughout CO and UT - believe it or not weather does matter to this company. Here in PC it's terrible. Some good snow over the weekend of 18"" really helped but too little terrain is open, We need a good dump- there may be a pattern change coming around Jan 5-10th so that could turn things around. Until then, why would anyone aggressively buy the stock when the technicals have turned on it?"
Wow what a hilariously high unwarranted share price.
It’s official. Dividend suspended until December 2020.
"How many people here are aware that when Peak sold out to Vail the Sackler family of Purdue Pharma Oxycontin fame made out twice!! Once when they invested in Peak and the second when Peak sold out to Vail!!And you wonder why Vail has lousy customer service !Institutions will be selling shortly when this has no revenue coming in this season.No snow, no customers, lousy customer service, treat their employees like dirt.This sock is wayyyyyyyyyyy over valued !I own no stock in it and i am not shorting just stating the facts."
Looks like there has been a lot of distribution of big holders getting out. When they are done the stock will recover. Until then I would rather be short than long this stock.

Vail Resorts is down 4.94% to 261.54
I expected a $3.52 jump in share price since that’s all they saved by canceling dividend distribution. Is this massive jump from shorts covering? Hardly seems like the business model has changed any and revenue growth is still at a stand still...
"david, none of what you say is true. None of MTNs resorts are short of water for snow making, 37 P/E is low for a smaller midcap, and skiing is growing, as shown by skier days, especially at MTNs resorts. Skiing isn't poor, won't be this season, and you will see it on the ground over the next 2 weeks. High season, which begins in February, will be normal. That means every room and condo booked to the gills, and 10,000 skiers on a powder day. Plus, there's WB now, and its 5,000+ ac of terrain and 1 mile of vertical drop, already has over a meter of base. I will hold, and buy more if this ever drops under 215, which I doubt."
how is this up? everything is closed.
stock paying 4.5 folks. time to grab some shares on this one
No way I'm renewing my and my kids' passes this year. Going to sit this season out or maybe by at the window if we do go.
glad I sold MTN at $301.50......I thought it would go downhill from there
"MTN shares having a winter clearance sale! Get them now at these low, low prices while the deal lasts!!"
What news is driving MTN?
The acquisitions just keep coming.
Tic-rock - “President Donald Trump said he might extend coronavirus social distancing guidelines into early summer.”
Called this 3 weeks ago.
"Don't they usually release how the pre sale ski pass sales went after labor day? With all the acquisitions and new slopes to ski at, I am expecting things to look pretty good goin forward."
"long term wxmps forecasts 2nd week January looks to dump 2 to 4 feet of snow in Sierra, CO, and WB, ahead of MLK wknd....and TGR chat indicates Skiers Plaza at WB full by 7am lining up for freshies. Looking promising but snow needs to hit the ground."
"Only 40m shares outstanding, institutions own over 100% of the float... if you're short you have your tips pointed up hill... ;-)"
Can we break through the 249 level from earlier in the year?
233.39 by tomorrow at 4PM
"Vail Resorts reports strong early season pass demandSep. 28, 2018 7:00 AM•SA Editor Clark SchultzVail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) reports resort EBITDA increased 3.9% to $617M in FQ4.The company says Season pass sales for the upcoming 2018-2019 North American ski season are up ~25% in units and 15% in sales dollars through September 23.Vail ended the quarter and fiscal year with $178M of cash on hand, $130M of borrowings under the revolver portion of its senior credit facility and total long-term debt of approximately $1.3B.Looking ahead, Vail expects FY19 resort EBITDA of $718M to $750M.Shares of Vail Resorts are up 0.1% in premarket trading to $286.50.Previously: Vail Resorts beats by $0.18, misses on revenue (Sept. 28)"
"Read the ski forum websites. Lots of negative feelings towards Vail right now, primarily based upon lack of communication (webcams not working), generic snow reports and very limited staffing based upon comments from skiers. Tread lightly...... folks are not happy."
10 inches of snow at Breckinridge last night for the final ski week of the season
How is this a 300 dollar stock this makes no sense
"That $1B bought 2 world class resorts, and the class of North America, within commuting distance of huge markets in Seattle and Portland. Colder, with exceptional March conditions. It will justify a 20% increase in pass sales revenue. Last chance, Andy. Sell those shorts before they are worthless."
Buy the dip. Great deal here at $275.
4 more ski resorts acquired by MTN!
Stock down almost 10% in last 30 days....significant loss of income if drought conditions continue...this is the same for all properties except for Whistler Blackcomb
"Isnt this a 30% dilution of equity, if MTN converts this new debt to equity?"
This cant break $225. Good luck.
"Another company that used all their cash for buybacks and dividends, what could possibly go wrong with that strategy. We'll, I didn't like the purchase of Peak Resorts, let's say they jumped the shark. Up until then Vail trafficked in Iconic resorts that were arguably worth the premium price. Peak Resorts, not so much. Why buy them then? Well when you're a roll up, which Vail is, you need to feed the beast with more inorganic growth. Now couple that with a recession, and an unhappy passholder base who are essentially owed at least a half a season of skiing. Mix in the fact that Alpine skiing is a very expensive endeavor and has little to no growth in the best of times. It's a luxury of all luxuries. Hell I spend $100 just on gas to go up skiing in the Northeast. Anyway, suffice it to say I am short. GLTA"
"this stock price is crazy, enterprise value at ridiculous nose bleed levels. $1,100,000 new debt, no day passes, no food, no alcohol sales, revenues will be down 50 percent from last year."
Cramer said today to avoid MTN as it is a stock that consists of resorts etc where people can get sick. I think I agree but what a run it had and Vail is an especially great place but now changed forever
This stock has no business trading over $100
Breaking out? If we close above 250 looking good.
"This company has had good growth the last few years but I don't see it having a good year this coming winter. Their new restrictions are silly. I usually spend about $5000 every year (ski passes, hotel, car rental and flights) to go to Colorado skiing/snowboarding with my girlfriend. They say you can make reservations before their core season starts and if you don't get the days you want you can get a refund. let's say I get my days reserved, they are only running lifts and gondola at 2ppl per chair and 4 ppl per 6person chair. That would be a disaster at Vail and Breck at the base. If that's not enough to worry about, what happens if Biden gets elected and is obviously more strict on social distancing. What if they cancel half the season and I only going to get 20% off like this year's passes. I can't risk spending 5k this year, hopefully I'm wrong though."
"You all know Vail is a real estate company, right?"
This is setting up for a nice short leading into upcoming quarterly results.
crushed it
"Those who follow MTN closely will recognize that Lift revenue according to GAAP is actually down more than the 20.9% reported today (probably by quite a bit). Discounts, credits, refunds, and foreign exchange headwinds are all excluded and likely they have not yet adjusted their revenue recognition for much higher utilization on season passes.Not much to look forward to here probably for at least a couple years."
I drove to the Mtn towns and it’s a ghost town. They lost 300million in sales by closing last month. Also there will be no summer operations which means no revues when they make a ton during summer. down the ship goes!
"If they open Breck for spring skiing, this thing will rocket..."
Massively overvalued
And away we go closing above 253. Next stop 275.
Wow. 19.7 increased dividend!
"hunter mountain closed today, they finally told the 200 people waiting to go skiing at 10am, you have to live the customer service of Vail resorts."
SOLD AT $292.25 - I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. WILL BUY BACK AT UNDER $250 - MAYBE TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I will see if current support holds. if not, 190 is right around the corner and will wait for that to hold."
why did this go down today
Vail Resorts Annual Report Available from SEC https://sec.report/Document/0000812011-19-000077/
"MTN's decision to not refund their customers who purchased their Epic Day Pass product is certain to negatively impact future pre-purchased products and drive customers to alternative resorts. For a company who already has a weak net promoter score, this will put the nail in that. What customer in their right mind would ever again purchase a pre-paid product from them?"
"Someone(s) is spending a lot of money, desperately trying to keep this solvent."
"Vail depends on the disposable income of folks who own stock and have retirement accounts that are hemorrhaging. They will be cutting back on vacation spending, less beer, fewer lessons and fewer days on the mountain & luxury rentals. Not really about today's earnings"
Durable Capital just filed its 13-F. They sold their entire position in Vail. Baron also reduced its holding.
"The ski industry is not growing much and hasn't for a long time...MTN has done a good job of consolidating the industry but ultimately this industry's profitability has a very high beta to the economic climate. I think it's a pretty good portfolio based short against stocks one is long. If the market stumbles in the next year or two MTN at a 37x multiple is extremely vulnerable.Also, regarding snow making, this is a restricted activity and at many of the western resorts they're pretty close to being done with their water allotment. There is a huge weather risk this year- will the Christmas vacation family who have spent $15k plus on their ski trip come back next year if the skiing is poor?"
"Vail Resorts are PIGS always raising the prices of lift tickets, food, condos , WHEN IS ENOUGH, there are no Walmart prices here. Sking needs to make it affordable for the middle class, or it will only be for the rich, I hope the go to ZERO and learn that the high end market is not everything"
"It's a consolidating subindustry. Two companies, Ikon and Epic/Vail, the publicly traded one. Will only grow more. Buy."
"Lack of snow and tourist activity has a grip on most properties.Earnings coming on 3/8 and the stock is way down. They know the earnings are going to be horrific. My best advice is to run and take shelter. Save what you can for later. This stock will trade well below 200 in near future. Read the tea leaves, ask the taxi drivers. They know whats to come. It's not pretty and loads of good people are going to get caught in this run up since 2015. Mark my words. Retreat."
