"MTN's decision to not refund their customers who purchased their Epic Day Pass product is certain to negatively impact future pre-purchased products and drive customers to alternative resorts. For a company who already has a weak net promoter score, this will put the nail in that. What customer in their right mind would ever again purchase a pre-paid product from them?"
"Can someone explain to me why this is trading near a 52wk high when it seems like nothing but bad news? 2019-2020 was a complete loss globally, credit for 2020-2021 pass holders, limiting daily ticket sales/mountain access for 2020-2021 season, little international and domestic travel and restrictions on mountain services (non skiing)...Am I missing something or people just buying now for what hopes to be a good 2022-2023 season?!"
"Most insane buy, inflation will stop travels!!"
What news is driving MTN?
"Shareholder just got done listening to the live conference call. Overall, honestly feeling nervous in terms of the 2021 fiscal year as a whole listening to the potential significant lost revenue in Vermont as well as Whistler and other resorts due to the travel restrictions. Since I am probably the only one who listened to it, ill just keep my personal opinions to myself. Started buying this stock over 20 years ago so I'm no stranger to this company. Overall, quarter wasn't the best and hate when they dodge forward guidance and not give any. Feel like im skiing in the dark lol."
Prediction: MTN will announce they’re reinstating the dividend in the next earnings call.
Vail Resorts reached an all time high at 358.49
"Too many headwinds here. Obviously travel will be way down this season, which hurts revenue big time since out of state guests bring in disproportionate revenue. Season passes have to be affected due to travel and operational concerns. Capacity of lifts etc likely to be significantly reduced. How many people will want to take that chance? Then you have the usual snow concerns along with the fact that they discounted passes 20%. Plus they took on $500m debt at a whopping 6.5%. Bleeding red ink and time not on their side. So this season is a write off and they are reduced to waiting for the 21/22 season. Meanwhile debt and deferred maintenance piles up. Stock is just about back to precious levels which makes no sense. I think they will survive and build back their revenue stream but will take some time. This stock should be around $180. Way overbought. Next quarter will be another miss and I look for reality on this to set in after the election."
"They want proof of vaccination at restaurants on the mountain this coming season, I'll pass on my epic local pass this year, same with rest of family."
"Those who follow MTN closely will recognize that Lift revenue according to GAAP is actually down more than the 20.9% reported today (probably by quite a bit). Discounts, credits, refunds, and foreign exchange headwinds are all excluded and likely they have not yet adjusted their revenue recognition for much higher utilization on season passes.Not much to look forward to here probably for at least a couple years."
"Here is my guess about what is going on. Vail is going to issue stock as a private placement at a discount to the current price. Since there are no real buyers for this stock, they are trying to pump it up before the dilution."
"Any possibility they are raising money to purchase other ski resorts that are in way worse situation than themselves and strengthening their monopoly? I hold puts on this resort for now but can see this stock move higher as soon as we are getting out of the covid era. However, skiing this season is a total waste of time!!"
Convertible debt offering for $500M. I wonder why they did this with interest rates at all-time lows?
Durable Capital just filed its 13-F. They sold their entire position in Vail. Baron also reduced its holding.

"Absolutely crazy action on this the past 2 days. Up 7.5% on NO NEWS (other than more negative news about more covid cases, and increasing likelihood of significant shutdowns. Assuming Biden wins, I imagine there will be further shutting down of the economy. Does not bode well for this stock. Stock is not HIGHER than it was before the pandemic hit. They had to give out 20% season pass discounts to make up for last season. Imagine the significant restrictions on lifts, which has to cut capacity big time. Also, the big drop in customers flying in and staying at the resorts has to be huge. Company had to borrow at 6.5% to sustain operations. The economy is in the tank, the demographics on this sport are challenging, there is always the wild card of snow, and we are facing a big second wave this winter with no prospect of a vaccine this season. Yet this stock rockets up every day. Who is buying at this level? I am short but confess I must be missing something here. I grant you this is likely to eventually recover post-vaccine,but that could be 2 long years off, with lots of red ink in between. Please someone educate me on what I am missing here."
"Decided after much thought to sell my 100 shares of MTN that I have been holding for many years. It was hard, but I got $280.18 a share. Working in the ski industry for 30 years and listening to conference call its just obvious to me that Vail Resorts is for now in the new covid world going to see substantial loss in revenue for the foreseeable future. No complaints, I did extremely well on my investment. Best of luck to the longs here, I will be back in the future just thing too much risk at these levels I've seen mtn crash hard last year Don want to go thru that again."
As predicted the dividend was reinstated after quarterly earnings. $3.52 per share equates to 50% of pre-pandemic earnings. Not bad!
"In addition to poor financial results, high leverage and frustrated customers, MTN seems to be challenged with public labor struggles recently. - Ski patrollers at Park City held a public rally this weekend to gain support for their contract negotiations.-Patrollers walk-out/""work exclusion"" caused a 3-day closure at Hunter Mountain earlier in Jan. (Vail's communication on this issue has been vague)-$100M lawsuit alleging violations of labor laws for not paying employees for all hours worked.Labor risks could be significant if they result in a major resort closure. At minimum I would expect that trends like this put upward pressure on labor costs."
