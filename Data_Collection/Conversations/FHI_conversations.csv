"FHI is averaging 1% per day since mid July. In 18 days the FHI dividend yield has gone from 4.49% (at $24.02) to 4.09% (at $27). Getting in now and it can be a 5% producer in 2021, IMO."

"FHI hit RSI 31 9/21, RSI 31 9/22, and RSI 33 today 9/23. Hope it is bottoming out. At this price it is paying 5.11% dividend annualized. Q2 beat by 17 cents, 27 cent payout every quarter last 3 quarters. Down to mid $21 today, good time to add. I hope. I like the expensive ""stock picker"" from London they signed on a year ago."

"Largest FHI holders are Blackrock and Vanguard, both are cost averaged at identical $19.04. FHI is only at a $5 premium to them (26%) at $24.04. Absolute majority here for dividends. Not a huge risk. They can pick great stocks: bought tons of hot tech stock Crispr for under what Cathie Wood's ARK paid."
