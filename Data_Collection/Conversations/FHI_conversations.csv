Yummy divy. I'm in
FII is down 4.93% to $25.45
"FHI is averaging 1% per day since mid July. In 18 days the FHI dividend yield has gone from 4.49% (at $24.02) to 4.09% (at $27). Getting in now and it can be a 5% producer in 2021, IMO."
Buyout $42-$45 / share.
Federated Hermes is up 5.06% to 34.22
FHI reached a 52 Week low at 14.57
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
FHI reached a 52 Week low at 20.10
FHI reached a 52 Week low at 27.65
"Largest FHI holders are Blackrock and Vanguard, both are cost averaged at identical $19.04. FHI is only at a $5 premium to them (26%) at $24.04. Absolute majority here for dividends. Not a huge risk. They can pick great stocks: bought tons of hot tech stock Crispr for under what Cathie Wood's ARK paid."
Up 9% seemingly out of the blue... anyone know why?
Federated Hermes is down 4.93% to 31.63

"If you bought FHI 10 days ago the dividend yield would have been 5.14%, if buy it now it would be 4.23%."

"Been buying the dips here but dropping like a rock? FII been hit with some downgrades or something, why keep dropping?"
"Oops, it seems that it will still going down and never recover, I really regret to buy FII, why you say there is an explosion?"
"FHI hit RSI 31 9/21, RSI 31 9/22, and RSI 33 today 9/23. Hope it is bottoming out. At this price it is paying 5.11% dividend annualized. Q2 beat by 17 cents, 27 cent payout every quarter last 3 quarters. Down to mid $21 today, good time to add. I hope. I like the expensive ""stock picker"" from London they signed on a year ago."
