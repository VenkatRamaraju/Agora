"EXAS will do very well over next ten years. No doubt. Right space, right decade, right leadership! I write this as I sit in the signature suite on a Seabourn ship! 850ish sq ft cabin, 1000+ sq foot balcony! Whole front corner of deck 7. If ever you book a Seabourn cruise, this is world class! Other couple we are with have other signature suite! We have both front corners! Covid has guests at 1/4 capacity! No better rooms on this ship! This is only my second ever cruise! Thank you dividend stocks! Thank you EXAS, and thank you NASDQ!"

"RiverPark Funds mentioned Exact Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) in their Q2 2021 investor letter; ""In the last year, Exact has pivoted from its single cancer screening tests (Cologuard for colon cancer and Oncotype for breast cancer) to multi-cancer screening through its Thrive acquisition, and to minimal residual disease and recurrence monitoring through its recently announced Ashion and Tardis acquisitions. Through this pivot, Exact has tripled its market opportunity from $20 billion to $60 billion.”"
GH results dragging us down more. First glance their numbers don’t seem better than Cologuard for early stage? No fda approval. But with the weakness recently I’m sure it will pull us down well into the 80s.
"Lord have mercy, this seems like it wants higher. Way too early to tell, but the selling in ARKK, ARKG and possibly some of the constituent holdings such as EXAS seems to have subsided the last few days. The prolonged downtrend from ATH's in February has been absolutely brutal. Fingers crossed we get a bump in screening revenue this quarter! And hopefully the 400 add'l Pfizer reps will get us some increased screening market share."
"The company already raised revenue estimates for this quarter in last quarter's earnings report. This quarter was more than half over when they did so. Plant is packed and they can't hire enough lab techs fast enough. Working three shifts. You can listen to the Fraud Street FUD experts, or to what the company is saying and actually doing."

"The next product they'll launch is 2.0, hopefully late 2022 as discussed on prior chats. Blood based colon cancer test somewhere after that and according to investor relations revenues from the liver test starting in 2023. What are your thoughts regarding the impact of 2.0 assuming it meets or exceeds expectations? The other big hurdle for cologuard is reimbursement for positive tests-is that ever likely to change? After all the % of positive tests may not drop if polyp detection is better for 2.0."
"In 2014 Cologuard made history. At that time EXAS was a one product company. KC and crew realized that basing a company’s future on one product, no matter how good, was a high risk strategy. They began using the proceeds from CG, and further investment capital to create a frontrunner company in the cancer diagnostics field, including in cancer patient clinical response prediction. They continue to move forward. They will likely move in to the next decade as a leader in their space. They are not perfect, but are executing at a level that exceeds 95% of their peers. Congratulations to the executive team. Stock up 900% since 2013/14’. Stock up 3720% since KC took over in 2008. (Yes, was below 25cents in 2008) Stock flat overall, but volatile for last year or two. Eventually all of their hard work will consolidate, and a much much larger company will emerge."
very close to 52-week low price ahead of ER on tuesday 11/02 next week will play its ER game as i know exactly how stock price will fare off upon ER
"A friend who’s an M.D. went to a dinner Grail had one night last week, and said their liquid biopsy approach for generic cancer detection is only 44% effective in detecting cancers. Doesn’t sound like they’ll be a threat to Exact Sciences for a while."
What are we thinking with earnings coming up? I was expecting we’d be back to 100$ by the time earnings came around - still possible but looking tough. To me this seems like a no brainer entry unless I’m missing something? Earnings have been strong.. I think that continues
In at 2 dollars waiting for 1000. I think it’s going to happen
"Interesting combination of hiring 400 salesman, 300 lab techs and running an advertising campaign about changing the paradigm with early detection using a blood based LB test. Our largest share holder buying more shares hand over fist. Seems like it might be a great time to add more here....."
"MADISON, Wis., Oct. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Exact Sciences Corp.

"One thing people fail to understand, is some profit taking to secure future up and coming companies by hedge funds!"
The fit test is what doctors use when they want you to get a colonoscopy all need is blood in stool is a positive. That is cologuard 2 has no blood in its test.
thinking out loud here .. is it possible that in office rep visits are going to be vastly diminishing in place of more digital marketing ? if that happens did Conroy and co. make a tactical error? the doc's on board will be able to answer this.. we seem to be banking on in office visits to promote CG for sure
