$WDFC new comer should read this https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/ptsj3y/wdfc_wd40_brand_dispute_jakarta_merchant_care/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
"topline declined from 124M in Nov qtr to 111M in Feb qtr...the ""home repair"" tailwind is truly tailing off. Add to that normalised oil & metal prices, and the gross margin declined a full percentage point from 56.4% in Nov qtr to 55.4% for the Feb qtr, as did the EPS. Even normalising the current qtr EPS of 1.24 works out to a full-year EPS of 5 (which is still VERY generous considering the home repair trade will be well and truly over by next 2 quarters)...but even with this generous full-year EPS estimate of 5, we have a VERYYYY stretched price-earnings multiple approx 62x at current price of 310. My guess? There is going to be a whole lot of down...even at 200 this would be at 40x earnings, and even then topline & EPS would still be in the declining phase. SELLLLL!!!"

"Why this stock is always going down what is happening come on company , I guess this company like their client to lose money , that is bad as hell"
This is close down below $230 again...
"WDFC is trading at a high multiple of peak earnings. Oil is a major input cost, and has been rising since last year. Pandemic spurred revenue growth will rollover and decline as purchasers have already addressed all their squeeky door handles and rusty bike chains. One can of Wd-40 lasts a long time in a household, so sales will plummet. Look out below....."
"Bizzare stock, often goes up when market is heavily down ... I wonder if it's getting flows from low beta etfs?"
"Going short now, will cover under 250...."

What is wrong with this stock Jesus I can’t even believe
"It is gonna sink as market open, the volume drove up 14% super low like just 1000 shares"
All this earnings beat just comes from lower tax provision.

Ripe for a buyout or to take private.
Who the hell is bidding this up every weeks for past 3 months? What is the catalyst that they think will make it a more valuable stock every week? 55/30/15 is an aspirational goal in CEO's own words. Besides stock buyback (which btw is also puny $75M) there is nothing that comes to mind which is making this the best performing stock in the US market.
The lawsuit could make $WDFC goes deep down again today!
"Can a buyer explain what is the case for the stock to trade at 42 times earnings at almost no growth, even before the virus outbreak? The stock still trades near all time high!"

The short interest is so high almost 20%. 37 days to cover. The short squeeze will be epic.
This stock suck as well as the company

$WDFC Bearish Signal on the today's chart
"Margins were lower, oil prices and aersol can prices are going up, logistics prices are up, customer made advanced purchase prior to price rise in June which basically accelerated the sale in Apr-June qtr. What is the reason for the WDFC to be at the level it is currently, can anyone provide any good reason?"
"Yup this should be closer to 170, but I'm not an analyst...The market will probably be neutral or go down tomorrow. That'll help this go down. This stock isn't in anyone's focus, but hedge funds and ETF's, and yet it doesn't seem to follow all of the market's down moves."

"For those who aren't aware or need help deciphering yesterday's quarterly report - WD-40 posted a dramatic beat, $136 million in sales and $1.52 versus $108 million and $1.15 consensus expectations. They also raised their full year growth guidance to 18% year over year sales growth at the midpoint. They also said they expected Covid growth to water down to mid-to-high single digit growth post-pandemic. This is still great news - as the company expects growth even beyond the pandemic."

"$WDFC DD here so far >> A cartel is an organization created from a formal agreement between a group of producers of a good or service to regulate supply in order to regulate or manipulate prices. In other words, a cartel is a collection of otherwise independent businesses or countries that act together as if they were a single producer and thus can fix prices for the goods they produce and the services they render, without competition. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cartel.asp This company don?t need bits to sell WD-40. I don?t even know if WD-40 has competitors because I?ve only ever heard of WD-40. They have a full-on monopoly of the WD-40 market. I don?t even know what WD-40 technically is but it?s a household name. It?s such a household name that its replaced the technical term like how how Kleenex has replaced tissues or how Chapstick has replaced lip balm. WD-40 is WD-40 is WD-40. Take a look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxhSYpBt5hM You can?t buy better branding than that so maybe they really do need to protect the formula with armed guards and a Brinks truck. WD-40 might be one of those inelastic products I learned about in economics. How wild would?ve been if an up-and-coming WD-40 brand had swooped in, broke into the Brinks truck, cut off the CEO?s arm and stole the suitcase? That would?ve been some #$%$ Now that I think about it they probably should?ve enlisted the military to help them switch banks. Transport that formula in a mother #$%$ tank. Just to be safe. $WDFC Take example on on the recent lawsuit against WD-40 in Indonesia: The feud began in 2015 when WD40 filed a lawsuit for the cancellation of the Get All 40 certificate to the level of the Supreme Court (MA). However, Get All 40 managed to reclaim its rights through the Intellectual Property Rights Appeal Commission (HAKI) by taking advantage of the issuance of PP 10 of 2019, concerning Procedures for Appealing Marks in Intellectual Property Rights. https://tributeasia.com/index.php/2021/09/09/the-brand-dispute-get-all-40-owner-suspects-theres-a-game/"
I read the conference call transcript last night... well most of it anyways.The fact that they raised guidance... let alone blew away expectations is more than enough to back up the truck today.You got a fire sale right now. Just wait until the analysts start to up their price targets.

I am so mad a this #$%$ stock
Anyway advice on WDFC
Big red day... I bought more calls cheap... out in August.It was a GIFT... gotta take advantage of that. This should be easily $300.
"Because of the sediment in my water, I must use a continuously cleaning product like 2,000 flushes.The last 2 bars I used, only lasted for about 100 flushes. They dissolved rapidly, turning the water not light blue, but very dark blue.By the way, even when they product is working normally, its no where near 2,000 flushes. I don't see a manufacturing date, but both bars were bought within the last month."
"Todays earnings show the economy is totally flat to slightly contracting. This all, in an easy money environment. It has a very high P/E, very low divi payout.Its not a buy, its not a sell, low volume tell you that there are not many new holders. Institutions own this thing.THE PUBLIC SHOULD STAY AWAY."
Picked up a couple of $280 calls expiring friday.... think earnings are gonna rip...
WDFC is down -5.04% to 126.30
Seems like a good opportunity for a short squeeze.
Still quite a bit overvalued?
"Beat earnings. I am not surprised at all. When is stock split? 2:1,3:1 ??"
"There is a lot to like about WDFC. Their unique product, greater than 50 percent gross margins, nearly enough cash and free cash flow (both roughly the same in value) to pay down all of their debt, etc. What's the bear case in a name like this? I've been repeatedly thumbs downed on here...those who don't like this company obviously are mad they missed out on their chance to get involved, but don't get mad there is still plenty of upside left in this name."
Tiny float and 11% short interest... they're lucky WSB doesn't notice.
Tell me again why this no growth stock is trading at a PE ratio of 40? They just missed earnings due to a 70% drop off in China. That foretells a big drop off this quarter in the U.S. and Europe.
