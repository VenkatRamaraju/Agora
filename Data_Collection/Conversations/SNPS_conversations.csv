Why are some stocks falling even though they beat both earnings and revenue estimates? Can someone please explain. Thanks
SNPS has turned into one of the best long-term investments in my lifetime.
SNPS has risen from $105 to $248 during the past 12-months. ROI exceeding 100% inside of one-year is rather exciting to me as a retail shareholder. Why is this message board always so silent?
Held for 8 months sold at a loss. Of course it goes up again. At least I bought NVDA.
Any insight into why such a drop with a good report for quarter and guidance inline with what is expected for the rest of 2020? I am still up 50% on this and expecting 180 by end of year.
"Bitcoin and stock trading rights now will be on every wise individual list, in a few months you'll thank yourself for taking such decisions. The world is gradually moving out of the I work for my boss era, people make money from the comfort of their homes these days. The world is going digital, working smart is far better than work hard. Although trading Crypto Currency and stocks isn't an easy task, one needs to have proper guidance and experience.

Solid earnings and forecast released. Analysts ratings updates coming next.
Reality check is around the corner! Cathy wood is the first to sell now wait for the others to wake up!
I have feeling that $MSFT will buy $CDNS since Microsoft decided to enter the chip design business. Or $SNPS will buy $CDNS to create a giant software IC design tools company.
"It's a beat, going up tomorrow ! Great company."
Great ER
$ 1.08 a share . Sorry
I wish SNPS would have some speculation tied in. Let’s think about all the self driving cars in the next 5-10 yrs that will need their technology
"Holding until $1,000"
"There is nothing to hold this stock back, every tech hedge fund and tech ETF has SNPS as a holding and it plays a central role in the chip business."
"Sold 100 shares @$300 after-hours, because that had been my price target. Still holding 400 shares. Admittedly the overall stock market could experience a correction due to the FED, Covid, and geopolitics. Synopsis is very well managed. GLTA"
"I bought this company solely on fundamentals in March at $230 when it seemed it had bottom out from the big drop. It was consistently growing and deliving each quarter and this seems to continue :) Definitely happy with the increase in SP, which I had not expected to already be around 40%"
Got my short in yesterday @ 200 x 1000 shares. Enjoy seeing this miss with bad guidance drop to 130 level. Enjoy the fall like i will in 10 mins. bwahahahahahahahahahaha
Just a buying opportunity here
Forward outlook way below expectations. Why is this stock still defying gravity? Actually up after hours on a disappointing outlook AND it's already at all time highs. Should get smacked back to reality on this report.
I don’t start my day without reading the morning email from (http://financialdeals.tech). It helps me make informed trading decisions that I know are a smart move. Don’t know what I’d do without them!
In SPPS from much lower levels. Earlier today I more than doubled my holdings at $152.00 ...... Time will tell if today's drop was a gift to longs like myself.
"great low profile stock. doing well, very steady, without speculative noise."
This stock is so underrated... awesome earning with decent growth. Raising outlook at each quarters.
Strong earnings
"I have both SNPS and CDNS, equal $ amount at buy, in my portfolio. Somehow SNPS is a little weaker runner. Thought, opinions? Should I increase SNPS?"
Probably a good time to start a small position.
105+ tomorrow.imo
I LOVE THIS STOCK
Earnings results?
Consider any pullback to be a buying opportunity. Good company and solid leadership team.
12x sales and a forward PE of 40? Yikes
Snps earned $108 a share for Q1 2018 matching Jack's forecast .
Why wouldn’t you buy. Solid/strong company that’s about to rocket to $300
