"I have to say that you have not solved the problems that deal with volume data for US quoted stocks. They are out of scale respect the volumes previous to the month of July 2021. I can see this problem when I download those data. I know that you have already said to me that I have to take these data as they are. However, you should be interested in improving the service of Yahoo Finance every day. This problem is a serious problem for investors. It has never taken place before now. It refers to US stocks only in general.Therefore, if I were you, I would upload a new data serie since the 1st of July 2021 according to all the previous data of volumes offered by you for each stock. It is an interest of yours offering a service as reliable as possible.Thank you so much for you assistance.Kind regards,Federico Morandini"
