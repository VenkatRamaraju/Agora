"When I download the volume data, they are out of scale respect the period until the month of July 2021.Therefore, this implies that Yahoo has a real problem with one of its servers I am used to connect to to download stock data or it has a problem with the quality of data inserted. You need to fix this problem to improve your service.I connect to you from Italy.Kind regards,Federico Morandini"
"I have to say that you have not solved the problems that deal with volume data for US quoted stocks. They are out of scale respect the volumes previous to the month of July 2021. I can see this problem when I download those data. I know that you have already said to me that I have to take these data as they are. However, you should be interested in improving the service of Yahoo Finance every day. This problem is a serious problem for investors. It has never taken place before now. It refers to US stocks only in general.Therefore, if I were you, I would upload a new data serie since the 1st of July 2021 according to all the previous data of volumes offered by you for each stock. It is an interest of yours offering a service as reliable as possible.Thank you so much for you assistance.Kind regards,Federico Morandini"
I look at the YTD spread and see only a long bullish trend

"What is a good company?? We have historically paid dividends, and while we have not adopted a formal dividend policy, we currently expect to continue to do so in the future. Beginning in 2019, subject to the recommendation of the board of directors, we plan to annually distribute at least 50% of our Adjusted Net Income."
"Thankyou so much for the solution of the problem that I have posted here. Now, volumes have the same scale as the previous ones for each stock. Nevertheless, I would like to point another problem with data of this and other stocks. When I download prices and volumes of each stock, I need about one hour of time. This is very good for about 10.000 quoted stocks. However, when I download fundamental data, I need 72 hours of contonous download and open PC to do this job. This is a great issue for traders. In fact, the choice of a good company is done by comparing hundred of stocks by using fundamental data too. However, your servers do not allow me to download fundamental data as quickly as I need, as it happens for data of volumes and prices. I ask you for a download speed as quick as possible for fundamental data too. I mean that I would like to have no particular limit by your servers. This job should take 1 hour at most. This is a problem that is common for thousands of persons who use your servers. This is an important solution needed to increase the quality of your service. I hope that you can solve this problem as soon as possible. Thankyou so much. Kind regards."

"Hh is the leader in the Russian job market. All large companies use the search for personnel through this resource. It ranks 1st in the search engine. In a crisis, many will lose their jobs and post their resumes on Hh and companies pay recruitment agents to find employees"
