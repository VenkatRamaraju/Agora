Why’s it going down today? Any news
"This appears to be one of the new new things...pure play on experience analysis and management...and they seem to continually announce new accounts. Let’s see what the next quarter brings...with their share count, I would not be surprised to see a secondary within 3-4 months nor $85 - 100 if they can maintain their tempo of new accounts."
Full speed ahead baby! Go baby go!
Hope this can go back to 30s
Where are the buyers?
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.17
Good basing action. Good entry point.Market like growth stocks.
Strong one month chart
Decent quarterly and down over $1 a share.Typical Wall Street manipulation.
"Key takeawaysThere's a lot to like about Medallia, especially after the stock has shed ~25% off recent highs. In my view, the company's slowing growth rates are counterbalanced by the fact that Medallia is vastly improving its margin profile, as well as the possibility that it's giving up lower-margin professional services revenues to third-party resellers.When we consider the fact that Medallia's closest competitor got bought out at twice Medallia's current valuation, Medallia looks like an incredibly compelling opportunity. Use the dip as a well-timed buying opportunity."
why the drop? overbought a few days ago?
90.44 % Held by Institutions . I also know CVS uses Medallia . I bought it last month when I saw medallia on all the forms I received when I got my vaccine

Bullish pattern! Jumping in !
"“I’m pleased with our performance in Q1. In addition to record subscription revenue we had our highest number of quarterly go-lives ever, as we added more new enterprise and mid-market customers,” said Leslie Stretch, President and CEO of Medallia. “We have more sales capacity and more product than at any other time in our history and more industry analysts validating our innovation leadership. We have strong geographic and vertical end-markets and more mature and effective alliances. Following record attendance at our Experience 21 conference we are focused on execution for the rest of the year and we see an opportunity to accelerate our subscription growth.”"
$27.20 close today? 
Nice bounce back from the dip. It'll be 35+ very quickly after mid 33 range IMO
It is really tiring to look at this stock
"Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $39 at Craig-Hallum After Non Deal Roadshow, from 35..Good sign!"
Why is it up today
It will recover tomo similar to what $WORK did today... last time to buy at this level... hurry up
"Looking for a monster quarter but who knows how the stock will react. Either way, solid choice for the long term"
"It's not insider selling. It's typically selling shares in conjunction with these senior executives exercising stock options, which creates taxable income. The IRS requires a 25% tax payment on the value of the shares and they allow for an easy way to sell some of the shares to pay for those taxes. It's all done in one simple process to the executives."
When is earnings date?
New deal with city of San Diego!
Announcement after close? :):):):):)
STRONG action this week. One more knockout qtr and we really pick up steam!!!
"After this drop, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strategic buyer step in. Going forward, companies need real time understanding of the customer experience and MDLA's purchase of LivingLens helps make that possible. I'm long MDLA so biased but does seem like a good strategic fit for companies like Oracle, IBM, etc."
this is going nowhete. i am out but gl
I see 50% to the upside tomorrow.
"Strong company, a bit undervalued compared to other public B2B-SaaS companies. Once volume stabilizes (after lockup expiration) shall do up."
it's crashing after hours 32 dollar :((. CC must have gone bad..!
"We have been using Medallia at my Job for years now (local cable company), so I got in at $43.07, not thinking it would just keep tanking since the day I got in. I do feel that since they are getting contracts with other businesses, this will hopefully be back up in the mid 40's after a few quarters. GLTA"
Worth the wait.
"When does the ""go shop"" period end?"
I feel it...$$$
This baby will be up in few days. Algorithms are selling it. Smart traders are picking up bargain deals.
"Do the opposite of what arimire says, this stock is alteryx like"
"Medallia has signed three huge contract this week, Way to go1 Canadian Automoble Association2. Service now certified Medallia in for IT and their stores.3. American Axle Manufacturing signed todayThe company is growing and is going to be the best stocks of 2019-20 and for long time to come."
Update! $27.50 close today
a hidden gem! Weird sooo quiet at the board :)
It’s still overvalued with a market cap almost $5 billion
A screaming buy stock! 40 dollar target!
Consolidating below the $35 mark. Bullish.
New agreement with Slack!
Stock should go up..50% below new PT of Citi :)
"Didn't know what to make of this company, but I took a stake anyway. I'm a believer now."
"I'm out. Sold during week in this 33.60 range. Maybe they can find a better offer, but I wanted to raise some cash. Good luck."
Medallia another big agreement! Where will it stop? :)
i got 1500 shares at 26.25 . Lets see how this one goes
Any thoughts as to why the big decline one day before earnings?
E.On whaww! 50 coming!
"Medallia has been differentiating itself with its AI-enhanced service. Even in a less-than-ideal 2020, subscription revenue growth has remained above 20% every quarter -- including a 22% year-over-year increase in Q3. Medallia does still operate at a slight loss (free cash flow was negative $26 million in the first nine months of the year), but it's on a clear path to profitability in an increasingly important segment of the software world. As more human interaction moves online, I think Medallia has room to run. And at just shy of 11 times 12-month sales, shares look like an attractive value for the long-haul."
I dont like the fact that the CEO sells shares before the quarterly results
$NOW part 2!
Nice move today this stock will be 70 by the end of 2019
hope u bought in yesterday. this will go up massively
Order in @ $30
Medallia...double down! Giving money away today.
Cramer is looking for undiscovered cloud plays. He has CEO on tonight!
any upgrades this should bounce back
Subscription based revenue grew by 17% and total revenue grew by 22% year over year. Around 94% institutional ownership. Nothing to worry about here
I hope it can go back to 32 again. So I can get my money back on the false breakout.
"I believe MDLA is an acquisition target. Just my opinion, but SAP recently bought Qualtrics for 8B. Medallia seems to have a better suite of services. If Oracle, IBM, Salesforce, etc were to pay 8B for MDLA, the price would be $66 per share - about an 80% increase from here."
So many big deals medallia is making!
Any constructive feedback on today's dip?
what do people thing after hours up or down? thanks
I see 25% to the upside tomorrow.
Why the drop?
"Their pace of contracts is a bit astonishing. If they can maintain this, the next two quarterly reports should be impressive."
Since this is trading at only $0.05 below the buyout price and closing isn't anticipated until year end (?) does this mean that the market anticipates a bit more as the final buyout number? I guess that $0.05 for two and a half months annualizes to about 4% so it could just indicate people parking cash in a safe haven that pays something. If there was actual buzz about a higher price then it would be trading higher than it is I suppose.
Back in the tank in Premarket.Shorted 25 percent yesterday down about 5 percent from Friday
I am holding long. They have an incredible management team. And I filled out two surveys today Sephora and Equinox. Both by this company.
This is gonna bounce back. Doubled up my shares.
"The lockup period ended in Jan for IPO shareholders and a massive amount of new share volume is in play. We're seeing a selloff based off fear, not fundamentals. Stay strong longs!"
"This Arimir is funny. He comments, then likes his own comments. Now that he’s lost money, he gives every positive comment a thumbs down. You still have a chance to get in for the rebound tomorrow to make up your losses...buyout target for sure in the future, but they are good to go on their own for a few quarters to build shareholder value. I’m sure some of the large players would love to acquire them and understand the next few months would be an opportunity to make a move. Either way, longs will be handsomely rewarded. Was shocked today at the chance to double down. Still have dry powder for more."
"agreed. not much of a drop on Friday which was about where it should have ended up. We will move up strong into the close and will likely be over 30 tomorrow but in a couple of days for sure. whoever is selling, thanks for the cheap shares."
"Good luck to everyone for today's ER. I think MDLA has a great future. Consistent rev growth, etc. Seems fairly valued given other stocks have much higher price/sales, or P/E ratios, but unless they beat EPS, Revs AND give good guidance, we may pullback over the short term. I've had 3 others in last week that dropped more than 20% UGH!!"
"Director Douglas M. Leone acquired 399,265 shares of this software application company, paying $28.12 per share for a total amount of $11.23 million.Doug Leone is a billionaire venture capitalist who has been with the premier VC firm Sequoia Capital for the last 31 years after stints at Sun Microsystems and HP. He made these purchases in his direct account and also owns several million additional shares indirectly via Sequoia and other entities. These purchases were filed with the SEC after hours on Thursday 9/12 and investors bid the stock up more than 14% on Friday 9/15.Once you decode Medallia's jargon-filled product platform page that is filled with phrases like ""neural network-based predictive models"" and ""fine grain data permissions"", you begin to understand that Medallia is a brand and identity management company. Unfortunately, the company's product pages appear to be written by geeks for geeks. I say this coming from a data analysis background having run an artificial intelligence project to analyze SEC filings.The post-earnings reaction to Medallia is a little surprising as the company posted a smaller than expected non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share compared to estimates of a loss of 15 cents per share. GAAP loss for Q2 was $38.45 million on revenue of $95.67 million, which grew 27% year-over-year. Most of the GAAP loss can be attributed to $35.18 million in stock-based compensation expense as is common with technology companies.Revenue growth is accelerating as you can see from the chart on the right, and the company claims it has less than 1% market penetration in a $68 billion market. Medallia generated positive cash flow from operation in two out of the last three quarters.Overall, the company looks interesting and worth exploring further. If the recent investment style shift from growth to value continues, this cloud technology company provide an attractive point of entry."
just bought 1700@32.66 and my stop loss @32. Worth the gamble in my opinion. SaaS companies always overvalued in takeover.
Stock on way to 100 by end of year!

"First it was arimire now Barros, a couple debbie downers, and negative nancys"
"Looking for an entry point, but can’t seem to find a bottom. Let’s hope this week, but the free fall has me nervous."
come on sell me 700 more st $30.45
This is a $15 stock..IPO supposed to be at $17..bumped to $22 pumped stock to $37 shorted havelyback to $15No way this company will make any money..$15 all over within a year
"IPNFF up 80% today.... This is an Augmented reality company that is changing marketing. way undervalued, check it out if you like , the website is futuristic"
Anything below $27 is a buy zone.
The analysts' have been reducing their EPS estimates over the last several months and that goes for next year as well. Anyone recall any mention of this by mgmt?
Positive news coming. Long on this
bought some this morning on the dip - great buying opportunity after earnings report as it beat both earnings per share and revenue numbers with raised guidance. Market manipulation at its finest - buy the dip!
"That's better , now keep rising"
"The drop today is senseless. If you’re in above $34 hold tight, it’ll bounce back. This dip is just profit taking"
Shakeout before the buyout!
More losses. Glad I got out just under $34 after buyout was announced. Put the pile of cash to good use!
New partnership confirms its going to 100 by end of year! :)
"On way to 40 , then 50..many new deals.."
Over 12000 puts just went through for June 19 17.50 puts.
"With $34 the offering price, selling below that is not wise, particularly with the provision “go shop” provision in the agreement. If no higher bidders found, at least you get $34!"
"-10%! This becomes insane, any reason for this or profit taking?"
"Medallia Inc. (NYSE: MDLA), the global leader in experience management, announced today that it will report financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 on Thursday, September 5, 2019 after the market closes. Medallia will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT on the same day."
What just happened? Big sharp jump on high volume!
What’s your guess on the opening price Monday and the closing price on Friday of next week?
Downward pressure on news of convertible bond issue. Good to raise capital during this low interest rate environment.
"The fact that it was $50 in February, it makes a great acquisition for CRM companies like Salesforce or Microsoft (Dynamics). If Medallia were to sell the company, I would presume it will be a huge premium compared to the current pricing around $30....."
no vol a/h not concerned glta tomorrow will reverse up
hang on to your shares. this is a great company
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.69
"Medallia (NYSE:MDLA) stock increased by 2.8% to $33.0. At the close, Medallia's trading volume reached 158.4K shares. This is 10.55% of its average volume over the last 100 days. The company's market cap stands at $5.2 billion. (Benzinga)"
Bank of america initiated with a buy! Target 50!
Both Bloomberg and CNBC reporting potential sale.... That makes 2 sources now
"I think this company is kinda big deal, which many people are still sleeping on."
$33+ next week$40+ Christmas gift
"Health care vertical enormous. Telemedicine has seen explosive growth and quality control by useless administrators is around the corner. The reason for the sudden strength, IMO. And justified."
getting tired of this stock
"Bought in at 40, added whenever there was a dip and now sitting at avg price 32.5."
50 by the end of the day
Up 10% from days low
"Significantly expanded my position on this pull back. It's now or never. If the trajectory has changed for these shares, we'll soon know."
Possible sale at $50..... Could be huge upside!
"Cc was good, stock will go up"
Medallia stock halted for volatility after sale talks report
just read transcript bunch of analysts congratulated them-im holding too many positives for company-glta
Does anyone care that they beat
Excellent company and management. Reminds me of $TTD in terms of how they are adapting to future markets and capturing share. Glad to see new partnership this morning - would be shocked if this isn’t a 100$ name by EOY
added a lot during dip. nice.
"$34 is undervalued. The share was above $40 just a few short months ago, and considering comps like Qualtrics, this should be a strong quarter for MDLA. I'd put fair price at $40-45"
Coming back to life now
Will this break 32/share??
"Back on it's way to 40, where it belongs!"
Y-FINANCE showing down 10% premarket. Anyone seeing anything?
Another good report. Steadily making progress.
"I feel so warm; fuzzy; almost tingly….our ceo receives great honor and is lauded with the laurel wreath…now, what about our share price…whatcha gonna do ’bout that bub????"
New agreement! New markets! 
No bottom here.Looks like somebody wants out
Credit Suisse really screwed MDLA today. The stock was trading over $33 Pre market today after MDLA reported a record quarter. CS lowered their price target from $42 to $37 and the stock has been trading down since. I don't understand the $5 drop of their target after a great quarter
"253 Institutions held 94.64% of Shares, so no worries, it will go 40+"
Trouncing the other SaaS shares I watch.
Needham analyst Scott Berg assigned a Buy rating to Medallia today and set a price target of $40.00. The company’s shares closed last Thursday at $35.13.
"I wish I bought more yesterday,,"
Maybe a class action suite is brewing and insiders are bailing.
Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $45 at Truist Securities
a screaming buy now!
Strong buy with price targets up to 52 - overreaction it is))
Can someone share the source
Finally going big up..up to 40 this time for real
Looks like a good entry point for an opening position.Just discovered this company in Kiplinger magazine and was endorsed as a longterm/secular investment..
"Above $40/sh and MDLA breaks out of its listing price, keep this in mind as that mark is not far away. With earnings approaching I can see $45 real soon."
Back to $21 IPO price?
"I am a buyer at $21, same price others paid for."
@Arimir - why do you always delete your posts? Leave your post history so others can judge your skill. Deleting just demonstrates that you try to scare the price into tanking
Bloombery reporting possible sale of the company..... Hellalujah!!!!!!!
bought in at $30.80.
Why down after hours
no volume considering the float-this will bounce back
nept sndl ebonI'm the Sektor you heard about
The shorts can only short medallia for so long. $50 price target for this stock in 12 months.
"Why is anyone selling this for under $34?! Aren't you guaranteed to get $34 in September? Are they concerned that Thoma Bravo might back out of the deal, or that shareholders would not approve ?"
Mark my words....back to 30+ in 2 days.....this is the cheapest SAAS and cloud play out there. Trading at only 7X next year revenue....where everyone else is on 15+X
Breakout.Sustained move over $33.
Time to buy
Should be up big....
Not much reaction.... -0.1%
next week 50..high volume..going up!
"fundamentally, company has great prospects, long term. Short term risk is more systemic/generic in nature (covid economic concerns, election year e.t.c). Overall tech correction followed by issuance of senior notes (potential dilution) right after does make the last week look terrible. As @Jim , from MDLA standpoint, good time to raise funds in cheap credit environment...had a position at @25- got out at 27 missed the whole run to 40 so didn't time that well... good stock if horizon is greater than 6 months"
Do you guys think it will go up more tomorrow for earnings or not?
Needham Issues a Buy Rating on Medallia (MDLA) | Analyst Ratingshttps://www.analystratings.com/articles/needham-issues-a-buy-rating-on-medallia-mdla/
Anyone know why it is down again today?
"Seriously here to those who know the company, why the massive loss this past Qtr ?"
A big win! U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Selects Medallia to Understand the Experience and Sentiment Across Mission Critical Services. Should drive stock price to 50 and higher..
"IMO, the sale ""rumor"" must be true. Management would've at least issued a statement indicating they are not selling if indeed they weren't planning on it."
Im just waiting for the right buying opportunity!!
40 times oversubscribed. Gonna price at $26- $30
"I bought Medallia just a while ago as a long term investment and now there probably will be a buy out.I don't really like that, even when I could make some profit..."
and I bought more at 30$...
BA 29.00/33.00 and this was supposed to price between 16-18 lol
