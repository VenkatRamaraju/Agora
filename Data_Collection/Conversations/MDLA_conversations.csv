"I'm out. Sold during week in this 33.60 range. Maybe they can find a better offer, but I wanted to raise some cash. Good luck."
Nice move today this stock will be 70 by the end of 2019
Worth the wait.

What just happened? Big sharp jump on high volume!
Lmaooo sold hod yesterday @ like $35.56 ... good move :)
"$34 is undervalued. The share was above $40 just a few short months ago, and considering comps like Qualtrics, this should be a strong quarter for MDLA. I'd put fair price at $40-45"
New partnership with Dirbato in japan
Any constructive feedback on today's dip?
C'mon MDLA lets go back to $26!
Positive news coming. Long on this
This is a $15 stock..IPO supposed to be at $17..bumped to $22 pumped stock to $37 shorted havelyback to $15No way this company will make any money..$15 all over within a year
"Good place to get out been a good run, markets getting bubbly again thinking FED has their back...de facto tightening starting in June, liquidity punch bowl drying up"
This baby will be up in few days. Algorithms are selling it. Smart traders are picking up bargain deals.
Good basing action. Good entry point.Market like growth stocks.
MDLA is a rising star
getting tired of this stock
Since this is trading at only $0.05 below the buyout price and closing isn't anticipated until year end (?) does this mean that the market anticipates a bit more as the final buyout number? I guess that $0.05 for two and a half months annualizes to about 4% so it could just indicate people parking cash in a safe haven that pays something. If there was actual buzz about a higher price then it would be trading higher than it is I suppose.
next week 50..high volume..going up!
"Cc was good, stock will go up"
What is this dheet
Again a BIG contract with US government! MDLA to the MOON
CEO on MM
Anyone know why it is down again today?
Does anyone know why this is going down if they reported such good earnings?
"My guess is that at the equity firm that wants to buy them, at around 3PM a memo went around that if you aren't in the office on Saturday, then don't even bother showing up on Sunday. They are rushing around to lock the deal down before the stock goes up any higher. Monday morning is going to be interesting."
"I think this company is kinda big deal, which many people are still sleeping on."
"This Arimir is funny. He comments, then likes his own comments. Now that he’s lost money, he gives every positive comment a thumbs down. You still have a chance to get in for the rebound tomorrow to make up your losses...buyout target for sure in the future, but they are good to go on their own for a few quarters to build shareholder value. I’m sure some of the large players would love to acquire them and understand the next few months would be an opportunity to make a move. Either way, longs will be handsomely rewarded. Was shocked today at the chance to double down. Still have dry powder for more."
A reward for us longs.
Medallia is up 6.89% to 44.36
New agreement with Slack!
"When the S&P pulls back 5-10%, this will be trading in the low 20s again"
Freefall after hrs and tomorrow.

$CRM is trading side ways. An other SaaS partners with $CRM. Look up $MDLA. It’s got legs in 2021. Up 20% YtD
"Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $39 at Craig-Hallum After Non Deal Roadshow, from 35..Good sign!"
Soon ready for a new leg up..up to 40! 2021 will be Medallia's year
should be in upper 37s tomorrow
Why’s it going down today? Any news
Who fill's out survery's these days?

What’s your guess on the opening price Monday and the closing price on Friday of next week?
Medallia reached a 52 Week high at 40.64
hang on to your shares. this is a great company
"Significantly expanded my position on this pull back. It's now or never. If the trajectory has changed for these shares, we'll soon know."
Cramer is looking for undiscovered cloud plays. He has CEO on tonight!
When is earnings date?
hope u bought in yesterday. this will go up massively
"I believe MDLA is an acquisition target. Just my opinion, but SAP recently bought Qualtrics for 8B. Medallia seems to have a better suite of services. If Oracle, IBM, Salesforce, etc were to pay 8B for MDLA, the price would be $66 per share - about an 80% increase from here."
a screaming buy now!
Both Bloomberg and CNBC reporting potential sale.... That makes 2 sources now
Not much reaction.... -0.1%
Another good report. Steadily making progress.
Roller coaster
I am holding long. They have an incredible management team. And I filled out two surveys today Sephora and Equinox. Both by this company.
Downward pressure on news of convertible bond issue. Good to raise capital during this low interest rate environment.
"Their pace of contracts is a bit astonishing. If they can maintain this, the next two quarterly reports should be impressive."
Finally going big up..up to 40 this time for real
"22 next target see how we react there and overall general market pulse too, frothy lots of froth right now"
I feel it...$$$
Bullish pattern! Jumping in !
Does anyone care that they beat
E.On whaww! 50 coming!
Stock on way to 100 by end of year!
"“I’m pleased with our performance in Q1. In addition to record subscription revenue we had our highest number of quarterly go-lives ever, as we added more new enterprise and mid-market customers,” said Leslie Stretch, President and CEO of Medallia. “We have more sales capacity and more product than at any other time in our history and more industry analysts validating our innovation leadership. We have strong geographic and vertical end-markets and more mature and effective alliances. Following record attendance at our Experience 21 conference we are focused on execution for the rest of the year and we see an opportunity to accelerate our subscription growth.”"
50 by the end of the day
Subscription Rev up 20% in a short quarter.
Bloombery reporting possible sale of the company..... Hellalujah!!!!!!!
"AH up already, next week up another +10%https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MDLA?p=MDLA&.tsrc=fin-srch"
"Medallia (NYSE:MDLA) stock increased by 2.8% to $33.0. At the close, Medallia's trading volume reached 158.4K shares. This is 10.55% of its average volume over the last 100 days. The company's market cap stands at $5.2 billion. (Benzinga)"
"IPNFF up 80% today.... This is an Augmented reality company that is changing marketing. way undervalued, check it out if you like , the website is futuristic"
It’s still overvalued with a market cap almost $5 billion
June 2 is not a good time to report earnings. Momentum for these tech stocks is almost over
Time to buy
Full speed ahead baby! Go baby go!
just read transcript bunch of analysts congratulated them-im holding too many positives for company-glta
40 dollar!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medallia-reports-record-second-quarter-200500948.html
"Their growth is masked in these acquisitions. They are failing to convert all these small deals and pilots into enterprise grade software. Costs are going up, margins are tight, and outlook is dire."
no vol a/h not concerned glta tomorrow will reverse up
Excellent company and management. Reminds me of $TTD in terms of how they are adapting to future markets and capturing share. Glad to see new partnership this morning - would be shocked if this isn’t a 100$ name by EOY
Anything below $27 is a buy zone.
Im just waiting for the right buying opportunity!!
Nice comeback gang.Gl to all.
Good day.
Medallia another big agreement! Where will it stop? :)
Hope this can go back to 30s
Lot of money will be made by those who invest in MDLA
@Arimir - why do you always delete your posts? Leave your post history so others can judge your skill. Deleting just demonstrates that you try to scare the price into tanking
Stock going down pfff results not good enough
Consolidating below the $35 mark. Bullish.
"Looking for an entry point, but can’t seem to find a bottom. Let’s hope this week, but the free fall has me nervous."
strong buy at the current price
I hope it can go back to 32 again. So I can get my money back on the false breakout.
Stock should go up..50% below new PT of Citi :)
Any idea when the earnings report is coming out?
BA 29.00/33.00 and this was supposed to price between 16-18 lol
just bought 1700@32.66 and my stop loss @32. Worth the gamble in my opinion. SaaS companies always overvalued in takeover.
Where are the buyers?
"Looking for a monster quarter but who knows how the stock will react. Either way, solid choice for the long term"
Any thoughts as to why the big decline one day before earnings?
Needham Issues a Buy Rating on Medallia (MDLA) | Analyst Ratingshttps://www.analystratings.com/articles/needham-issues-a-buy-rating-on-medallia-mdla/
Strong one month chart
Fake news
"First it was arimire now Barros, a couple debbie downers, and negative nancys"
Strong buy with price targets up to 52 - overreaction it is))
"The drop today is senseless. If you’re in above $34 hold tight, it’ll bounce back. This dip is just profit taking"
i got 1500 shares at 26.25 . Lets see how this one goes
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.69
$NOW part 2!
Decent quarterly and down over $1 a share.Typical Wall Street manipulation.
"That's better , now keep rising"
"When does the ""go shop"" period end?"
"Key takeawaysThere's a lot to like about Medallia, especially after the stock has shed ~25% off recent highs. In my view, the company's slowing growth rates are counterbalanced by the fact that Medallia is vastly improving its margin profile, as well as the possibility that it's giving up lower-margin professional services revenues to third-party resellers.When we consider the fact that Medallia's closest competitor got bought out at twice Medallia's current valuation, Medallia looks like an incredibly compelling opportunity. Use the dip as a well-timed buying opportunity."
"The lockup period ended in Jan for IPO shareholders and a massive amount of new share volume is in play. We're seeing a selloff based off fear, not fundamentals. Stay strong longs!"
Stock range bound 36-37 seems like it will go lower. could be insider info is out they may miss else this stock should already be at $40
MDLA is a buy at anything <$28
"I bought Medallia just a while ago as a long term investment and now there probably will be a buy out.I don't really like that, even when I could make some profit..."
any upgrades this should bounce back
Over 12000 puts just went through for June 19 17.50 puts.
Shakeout before the buyout!
"Can't believe all the pumpers on this board, at the height of a market bubble, when the whole market is insanely inflated, and this stock is hyper-inflated. The fact that no one took profits after a 50% run up and that so many are expecting another 50% up from here is just a blatant testament to the out of control greed bordering on stupidity that has seized hold of the market thanks to criminal Fed pumping."
My life savings is on the line plus 3x MARGIN. I need this to pump. All in YOLO!!
Why the drop?
"I am a buyer at $21, same price others paid for."
90.44 % Held by Institutions . I also know CVS uses Medallia . I bought it last month when I saw medallia on all the forms I received when I got my vaccine
come on sell me 700 more st $30.45
"The fact that it was $50 in February, it makes a great acquisition for CRM companies like Salesforce or Microsoft (Dynamics). If Medallia were to sell the company, I would presume it will be a huge premium compared to the current pricing around $30....."
A screaming buy stock! 40 dollar target!
Y-FINANCE showing down 10% premarket. Anyone seeing anything?
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.17
More losses. Glad I got out just under $34 after buyout was announced. Put the pile of cash to good use!
So many big deals medallia is making!
"missed my 28.25 target to short some more of this, have to be content with 1/3 position on only will not chase, however moved down to 27.75 on 1/3 to sell some more...target 22 still first, likely 15 this year"
"why is this stock going down?? its not that bad to have such a big drop, i cant believe my only stock doing close to holding ground is amc thats supposed to be the longshot squeeze stock"
"All big company have there own data analysts, they will loose clients with time, buy director insider buy they can’t keep their price up long time. They need profit, earning "
I see 25% to the upside tomorrow.
Tough business climate in CA when the government takes a big chunk.Clue: Move to AZ or NV.Boom: Stock price up 30% IMHO
"Bought in at 40, added whenever there was a dip and now sitting at avg price 32.5."
a hidden gem! Weird sooo quiet at the board :)
Up 10% from days low
It is really tiring to look at this stock
why the drop? overbought a few days ago?
Zero volume 
another good PR
Big beat all around..After hours is thin volume noise..watch this be green tommorow
Breakout.Sustained move over $33.
$27.20 close today? 
"Good luck to everyone for today's ER. I think MDLA has a great future. Consistent rev growth, etc. Seems fairly valued given other stocks have much higher price/sales, or P/E ratios, but unless they beat EPS, Revs AND give good guidance, we may pullback over the short term. I've had 3 others in last week that dropped more than 20% UGH!!"
"Seriously here to those who know the company, why the massive loss this past Qtr ?"
"-10%! This becomes insane, any reason for this or profit taking?"
New deal with city of San Diego!
A top pick for 2021 at Oppenheimer.
"This appears to be one of the new new things...pure play on experience analysis and management...and they seem to continually announce new accounts. Let’s see what the next quarter brings...with their share count, I would not be surprised to see a secondary within 3-4 months nor $85 - 100 if they can maintain their tempo of new accounts."
STRONG action this week. One more knockout qtr and we really pick up steam!!!
bought at open
Subscription based revenue grew by 17% and total revenue grew by 22% year over year. Around 94% institutional ownership. Nothing to worry about here
"Bought at 36$, sold the half at 34,60. Great Investment so far"
"I feel so warm; fuzzy; almost tingly….our ceo receives great honor and is lauded with the laurel wreath…now, what about our share price…whatcha gonna do ’bout that bub????"
"Medallia Inc. (NYSE: MDLA), the global leader in experience management, announced today that it will report financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 on Thursday, September 5, 2019 after the market closes. Medallia will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT on the same day."
"Health care vertical enormous. Telemedicine has seen explosive growth and quality control by useless administrators is around the corner. The reason for the sudden strength, IMO. And justified."
"On way to 40 , then 50..many new deals.."
nept sndl ebonI'm the Sektor you heard about
Announcement after close? :):):):):)
bought some this morning on the dip - great buying opportunity after earnings report as it beat both earnings per share and revenue numbers with raised guidance. Market manipulation at its finest - buy the dip!
Why down after hours
Medallia...double down! Giving money away today.
"fundamentally, company has great prospects, long term. Short term risk is more systemic/generic in nature (covid economic concerns, election year e.t.c). Overall tech correction followed by issuance of senior notes (potential dilution) right after does make the last week look terrible. As @Jim , from MDLA standpoint, good time to raise funds in cheap credit environment...had a position at @25- got out at 27 missed the whole run to 40 so didn't time that well... good stock if horizon is greater than 6 months"
very strong company
"Above $40/sh and MDLA breaks out of its listing price, keep this in mind as that mark is not far away. With earnings approaching I can see $45 real soon."
40 times oversubscribed. Gonna price at $26- $30
Will this break 32/share??
This is gonna bounce back. Doubled up my shares.
Trouncing the other SaaS shares I watch.
Is everyone ready to see $40 post earnings? Wrap your mind around that because it's our future. And others will catch on to how vital data and metrics are to achieving high customer satisfaction!! And Medallia is the solution!
"Medallia has signed three huge contract this week, Way to go1 Canadian Automoble Association2. Service now certified Medallia in for IT and their stores.3. American Axle Manufacturing signed todayThe company is growing and is going to be the best stocks of 2019-20 and for long time to come."
Short short short
what do people thing after hours up or down? thanks
Possible sale at $50..... Could be huge upside!
"Earnings tomorrow 4:30pm est. If is good and it should be and we don't have a market sell off, this should pop and run to $35 easy"
This stock is sooo low!
"WoW! Medallia keeps on signing new huge contracts in past month,SoftbankPizz hutCommSay insuranceCanada Automobile Associationservice Now Certification for It and ServiceNow StoresAmerican Axel Under Canvass Unbelievable growth"
it's crashing after hours 32 dollar :((. CC must have gone bad..!
added a lot during dip. nice.
"Why is anyone selling this for under $34?! Aren't you guaranteed to get $34 in September? Are they concerned that Thoma Bravo might back out of the deal, or that shareholders would not approve ?"
Maybe a class action suite is brewing and insiders are bailing.
I feel like I am trying to catch a falling Knife. What is happening here?
Needham analyst Scott Berg assigned a Buy rating to Medallia today and set a price target of $40.00. The company’s shares closed last Thursday at $35.13.
Looks like a good entry point for an opening position.Just discovered this company in Kiplinger magazine and was endorsed as a longterm/secular investment..
no volume considering the float-this will bounce back
Back to $21 IPO price?
OMG! I'm buying....what a steal!! 
"Just bought in. Keeps going down, near $31"
"I wish I bought more yesterday,,"
Over $32 million in losses. No wonder they use non-GAAP
Many new products and nice move up!
Do you guys think it will go up more tomorrow for earnings or not?
"Do the opposite of what arimire says, this stock is alteryx like"
Miss or beat today?
Should be up big....
See WORK today...to get feel for MDLA tomorrow
Back in the tank in Premarket.Shorted 25 percent yesterday down about 5 percent from Friday
"IMO, the sale ""rumor"" must be true. Management would've at least issued a statement indicating they are not selling if indeed they weren't planning on it."
Coming back to life now
$33+ next week$40+ Christmas gift
"Another quarter of losses, and they are expecting 15 to 20% more losses next quarter, almost 40 million dollars. That's the reason for the drop. Earnings mean nothing if you have a loss and you're not making a profit"
Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $45 at Truist Securities
another scam stock design to failed....$10 in ayearIPO at $21 now$ 32insider will be dumping
When you don’t find shares to short 
"253 Institutions held 94.64% of Shares, so no worries, it will go 40+"
Maybe Leone will buy some more or an acquisition will come in a take us to humm who likes wants analytics? Cisco ?
Medallia stock halted for volatility after sale talks report
Any predictions on earnings / share price on 9/5? It's been kinda quiet with this stock.
The analysts' have been reducing their EPS estimates over the last several months and that goes for next year as well. Anyone recall any mention of this by mgmt?
bought in at $30.80.
Curious to hear how the CEO’s tone will be on this call. Stock would be in mid 40s if he shows any sign of positive emotion
I dont like the fact that the CEO sells shares before the quarterly results
MDLA is down 10.29% to 18.31
"I think A major grocery store will be signing on.With tight margins and competition getting hot, there’s absolutely no room for screwy customer experience.For example I was in my neighborhood grocer today looking for a can of tomato sauce. I couldn’t find it. I asked the cashier at the customer service desk and she directed me back to the aisle where I already was. That One only had tomato sauce in a jar. I decided to leave because I did not have the time or the energy to hunt down tomato sauce in a can.I would like to believe that I amNot the only customer who ended up leaving the store not being able to find what they wanted. But they do such a good job asking you when you leave did you find everything you wanted sir"
"The stockmarket has very little to do with product and earnings, future $$ filling a need etc etc. The ppl that push the buttons go out for dinner and drinks and say lets sell and short stocks that have gone up bigly. We'll meet next week and go long....READY BREAK"
No bottom here.Looks like somebody wants out
"Sell, sell, sll out before heavy loss......"
Nice bounce back from the dip. It'll be 35+ very quickly after mid 33 range IMO
Great company with a great perspective
"After this drop, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strategic buyer step in. Going forward, companies need real time understanding of the customer experience and MDLA's purchase of LivingLens helps make that possible. I'm long MDLA so biased but does seem like a good strategic fit for companies like Oracle, IBM, etc."
Update! $27.50 close today
Bank of america initiated with a buy! Target 50!
It will recover tomo similar to what $WORK did today... last time to buy at this level... hurry up
I am left handed.
"We have been using Medallia at my Job for years now (local cable company), so I got in at $43.07, not thinking it would just keep tanking since the day I got in. I do feel that since they are getting contracts with other businesses, this will hopefully be back up in the mid 40's after a few quarters. GLTA"
Can someone share the source
"Director Douglas M. Leone acquired 399,265 shares of this software application company, paying $28.12 per share for a total amount of $11.23 million.Doug Leone is a billionaire venture capitalist who has been with the premier VC firm Sequoia Capital for the last 31 years after stints at Sun Microsystems and HP. He made these purchases in his direct account and also owns several million additional shares indirectly via Sequoia and other entities. These purchases were filed with the SEC after hours on Thursday 9/12 and investors bid the stock up more than 14% on Friday 9/15.Once you decode Medallia's jargon-filled product platform page that is filled with phrases like ""neural network-based predictive models"" and ""fine grain data permissions"", you begin to understand that Medallia is a brand and identity management company. Unfortunately, the company's product pages appear to be written by geeks for geeks. I say this coming from a data analysis background having run an artificial intelligence project to analyze SEC filings.The post-earnings reaction to Medallia is a little surprising as the company posted a smaller than expected non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share compared to estimates of a loss of 15 cents per share. GAAP loss for Q2 was $38.45 million on revenue of $95.67 million, which grew 27% year-over-year. Most of the GAAP loss can be attributed to $35.18 million in stock-based compensation expense as is common with technology companies.Revenue growth is accelerating as you can see from the chart on the right, and the company claims it has less than 1% market penetration in a $68 billion market. Medallia generated positive cash flow from operation in two out of the last three quarters.Overall, the company looks interesting and worth exploring further. If the recent investment style shift from growth to value continues, this cloud technology company provide an attractive point of entry."
"With $34 the offering price, selling below that is not wise, particularly with the provision “go shop” provision in the agreement. If no higher bidders found, at least you get $34!"
"It's not insider selling. It's typically selling shares in conjunction with these senior executives exercising stock options, which creates taxable income. The IRS requires a 25% tax payment on the value of the shares and they allow for an easy way to sell some of the shares to pay for those taxes. It's all done in one simple process to the executives."
BTIG increase target to 49 dollar and buy rating!
"Didn't know what to make of this company, but I took a stake anyway. I'm a believer now."
this should be 250 and not 25
Credit Suisse really screwed MDLA today. The stock was trading over $33 Pre market today after MDLA reported a record quarter. CS lowered their price target from $42 to $37 and the stock has been trading down since. I don't understand the $5 drop of their target after a great quarter
and I bought more at 30$...
New partnership confirms its going to 100 by end of year! :)
@arimir you twitted a few hours ago: “48% of investors are shorting $MDLAWe could see a Short Squeeze and stock pumping +20% anytime...” and now you post a picture of the titanic. Can you help us to understand that inconsistency?
"22 target on downside first , we get there id look to short any bounce up to 26 area, current short area 28.25"
"If this drops more on Monday, I will buy another couple hundred shares"
New agreement! New markets! 
The shorts can only short medallia for so long. $50 price target for this stock in 12 months.
Mark my words....back to 30+ in 2 days.....this is the cheapest SAAS and cloud play out there. Trading at only 7X next year revenue....where everyone else is on 15+X
Volume is a good sign.
Medallia is down 8.14% to 31.08
Why is it up today
A big win! U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Selects Medallia to Understand the Experience and Sentiment Across Mission Critical Services. Should drive stock price to 50 and higher..
Medallia is up 9.29% to 27.40
Looks like same trading pattern as yesterday.Dip and then Rip
Nice Home Depot deal should bring the stock above 35 dollar..
"agreed. not much of a drop on Friday which was about where it should have ended up. We will move up strong into the close and will likely be over 30 tomorrow but in a couple of days for sure. whoever is selling, thanks for the cheap shares."
"Strong company, a bit undervalued compared to other public B2B-SaaS companies. Once volume stabilizes (after lockup expiration) shall do up."
"Medallia has been differentiating itself with its AI-enhanced service. Even in a less-than-ideal 2020, subscription revenue growth has remained above 20% every quarter -- including a 22% year-over-year increase in Q3. Medallia does still operate at a slight loss (free cash flow was negative $26 million in the first nine months of the year), but it's on a clear path to profitability in an increasingly important segment of the software world. As more human interaction moves online, I think Medallia has room to run. And at just shy of 11 times 12-month sales, shares look like an attractive value for the long-haul."
