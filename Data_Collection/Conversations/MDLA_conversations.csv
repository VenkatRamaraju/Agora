Shakeout before the buyout!

@Arimir - why do you always delete your posts? Leave your post history so others can judge your skill. Deleting just demonstrates that you try to scare the price into tanking
Any thoughts as to why the big decline one day before earnings?
Any predictions on earnings / share price on 9/5? It's been kinda quiet with this stock.
I dont like the fact that the CEO sells shares before the quarterly results
Finally going big up..up to 40 this time for real
"fundamentally, company has great prospects, long term. Short term risk is more systemic/generic in nature (covid economic concerns, election year e.t.c). Overall tech correction followed by issuance of senior notes (potential dilution) right after does make the last week look terrible. As @Jim , from MDLA standpoint, good time to raise funds in cheap credit environment...had a position at @25- got out at 27 missed the whole run to 40 so didn't time that well... good stock if horizon is greater than 6 months"
MDLA is down 8.72% to 17.89
Nice bounce back from the dip. It'll be 35+ very quickly after mid 33 range IMO
why the 2 day drop?
MDLA reached an all time low at 25.68
"Medallia flying as of late. Any notions as to why? Quarterlies are still a month away, I haven't seen anything of note. Regardless, I appreciate the bump."
"May end the day in ""green"""
More losses. Glad I got out just under $34 after buyout was announced. Put the pile of cash to good use!
"Bought in at 40, added whenever there was a dip and now sitting at avg price 32.5."
Curious to hear how the CEO’s tone will be on this call. Stock would be in mid 40s if he shows any sign of positive emotion
No affect
"I care about today . I am back in and thought I got a good price, not good enuf"
"Back on it's way to 40, where it belongs!"
It’s still overvalued with a market cap almost $5 billion
Any news why the sudden tank
MDLA is down 8.93% to 18.25
A top pick for 2021 at Oppenheimer.
no volume considering the float-this will bounce back
"There is some resistance at $30, a lot of buy sale targeted that no, but it will break down soon... no one can stop thunder to fall on earth"
Added some here. I think there is an opportunity for a little bounce
Not much reaction.... -0.1%
Good day.
$33+ next week$40+ Christmas gift
"Medallia (NYSE:MDLA) stock increased by 2.8% to $33.0. At the close, Medallia's trading volume reached 158.4K shares. This is 10.55% of its average volume over the last 100 days. The company's market cap stands at $5.2 billion. (Benzinga)"

Where are the buyers?
I am holding long. They have an incredible management team. And I filled out two surveys today Sephora and Equinox. Both by this company.
"I just sold all my shares, not a huge gain but a decent one. Not bad for 3 trading days"
Suddenly quite close to the 52 week high. Hoping for another great week.
$27.20 close today? 
"Sell, sell, sll out before heavy loss......"
"Good place to get out been a good run, markets getting bubbly again thinking FED has their back...de facto tightening starting in June, liquidity punch bowl drying up"
Short short short
Why are insiders selling?
and I bought more at 30$...
Nice comeback gang.Gl to all.
Anyone know why it is down again today?
another good PR
Any idea when the earnings report is coming out?
Veeva great company to partner with
Roller coaster
I hope it can go back to 32 again. So I can get my money back on the false breakout.

"This caught my eye a few days ago because it dropped so much in the past month, which is when I like to buy, but in looking at it I’m sorry but I personally just find it more than just a little overvalued. There’s a good chance it won’t get as low as I’d want but we’ll see in the coming weeks..."
"Key takeawaysThere's a lot to like about Medallia, especially after the stock has shed ~25% off recent highs. In my view, the company's slowing growth rates are counterbalanced by the fact that Medallia is vastly improving its margin profile, as well as the possibility that it's giving up lower-margin professional services revenues to third-party resellers.When we consider the fact that Medallia's closest competitor got bought out at twice Medallia's current valuation, Medallia looks like an incredibly compelling opportunity. Use the dip as a well-timed buying opportunity."
Medallia is up 9.29% to 27.40
What the Febg is goin on?
Medallia is up 7.57% to 31.83
Needham analyst Scott Berg assigned a Buy rating to Medallia today and set a price target of $40.00. The company’s shares closed last Thursday at $35.13.
Any news?
"Seriously here to those who know the company, why the massive loss this past Qtr ?"
"Strong company, a bit undervalued compared to other public B2B-SaaS companies. Once volume stabilizes (after lockup expiration) shall do up."
"agreed. not much of a drop on Friday which was about where it should have ended up. We will move up strong into the close and will likely be over 30 tomorrow but in a couple of days for sure. whoever is selling, thanks for the cheap shares."
"Good luck to everyone for today's ER. I think MDLA has a great future. Consistent rev growth, etc. Seems fairly valued given other stocks have much higher price/sales, or P/E ratios, but unless they beat EPS, Revs AND give good guidance, we may pullback over the short term. I've had 3 others in last week that dropped more than 20% UGH!!"
Announcement after close? :):):):):)
Why the drop?
Coming back to life now
"The house of cards came unglued with one question from Chad Bennett, priceless."
MDLA is down 10.29% to 18.31
"Rule #1, preserve the capital. Unfortunately, I had to take my money back. Back to the watch list, for now. Not any easy game."
Why is it up today
Maybe a class action suite is brewing and insiders are bailing.
MDLA is up 9.05% to 43.00
Medallia is down 7.73% to 28.76
It is really tiring to look at this stock

Stock going down pfff results not good enough
"Significantly expanded my position on this pull back. It's now or never. If the trajectory has changed for these shares, we'll soon know."
"Director Douglas M. Leone acquired 399,265 shares of this software application company, paying $28.12 per share for a total amount of $11.23 million.Doug Leone is a billionaire venture capitalist who has been with the premier VC firm Sequoia Capital for the last 31 years after stints at Sun Microsystems and HP. He made these purchases in his direct account and also owns several million additional shares indirectly via Sequoia and other entities. These purchases were filed with the SEC after hours on Thursday 9/12 and investors bid the stock up more than 14% on Friday 9/15.Once you decode Medallia's jargon-filled product platform page that is filled with phrases like ""neural network-based predictive models"" and ""fine grain data permissions"", you begin to understand that Medallia is a brand and identity management company. Unfortunately, the company's product pages appear to be written by geeks for geeks. I say this coming from a data analysis background having run an artificial intelligence project to analyze SEC filings.The post-earnings reaction to Medallia is a little surprising as the company posted a smaller than expected non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share compared to estimates of a loss of 15 cents per share. GAAP loss for Q2 was $38.45 million on revenue of $95.67 million, which grew 27% year-over-year. Most of the GAAP loss can be attributed to $35.18 million in stock-based compensation expense as is common with technology companies.Revenue growth is accelerating as you can see from the chart on the right, and the company claims it has less than 1% market penetration in a $68 billion market. Medallia generated positive cash flow from operation in two out of the last three quarters.Overall, the company looks interesting and worth exploring further. If the recent investment style shift from growth to value continues, this cloud technology company provide an attractive point of entry."
"When the S&P pulls back 5-10%, this will be trading in the low 20s again"
MDLA is a rising star
"This Arimir is funny. He comments, then likes his own comments. Now that he’s lost money, he gives every positive comment a thumbs down. You still have a chance to get in for the rebound tomorrow to make up your losses...buyout target for sure in the future, but they are good to go on their own for a few quarters to build shareholder value. I’m sure some of the large players would love to acquire them and understand the next few months would be an opportunity to make a move. Either way, longs will be handsomely rewarded. Was shocked today at the chance to double down. Still have dry powder for more."
Trouncing the other SaaS shares I watch.

"I am a buyer at $21, same price others paid for."
Medallia...double down! Giving money away today.
MDLA not performing well in getting their larger deals over the line. They addedvertical teams and made small acquisitions to cover the fact that their enterprise grade software growth has stalled. Their IPO said 20% YOY growth. Down to less then 10% now.

Impressive volume today! Just wow! Whoop tee doo!
getting tired of this stock
So many big deals medallia is making!
"It's not insider selling. It's typically selling shares in conjunction with these senior executives exercising stock options, which creates taxable income. The IRS requires a 25% tax payment on the value of the shares and they allow for an easy way to sell some of the shares to pay for those taxes. It's all done in one simple process to the executives."
Medallia is up 9.57% to 26.90
"I wish I bought more yesterday,,"
"22 next target see how we react there and overall general market pulse too, frothy lots of froth right now"

They'll take out stops at 30
Volume is low. Why there’s no news?
Medallia is down 8.14% to 31.08
Good time to load big.
Zero volume 
"Again heavy down while nasdaq almost in green, it's a volatile stock!"
"I believe MDLA is an acquisition target. Just my opinion, but SAP recently bought Qualtrics for 8B. Medallia seems to have a better suite of services. If Oracle, IBM, Salesforce, etc were to pay 8B for MDLA, the price would be $66 per share - about an 80% increase from here."
Subscription based revenue grew by 17% and total revenue grew by 22% year over year. Around 94% institutional ownership. Nothing to worry about here
"I think this company is kinda big deal, which many people are still sleeping on."
Back to $21 IPO price?
Update! $27.50 close today
No bottom here.Looks like somebody wants out
"Their growth is masked in these acquisitions. They are failing to convert all these small deals and pilots into enterprise grade software. Costs are going up, margins are tight, and outlook is dire."
Load up the truck tomorrow
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.17
Medallia reached a 52 Week high at 42.19
"My guess is that at the equity firm that wants to buy them, at around 3PM a memo went around that if you aren't in the office on Saturday, then don't even bother showing up on Sunday. They are rushing around to lock the deal down before the stock goes up any higher. Monday morning is going to be interesting."
Does anyone care that they beat
New agreement! New markets! 
Looks like same trading pattern as yesterday.Dip and then Rip
Positive news coming. Long on this
Downward pressure on news of convertible bond issue. Good to raise capital during this low interest rate environment.
"On way to 40 , then 50..many new deals.."
Credit Suisse really screwed MDLA today. The stock was trading over $33 Pre market today after MDLA reported a record quarter. CS lowered their price target from $42 to $37 and the stock has been trading down since. I don't understand the $5 drop of their target after a great quarter

"I think A major grocery store will be signing on.With tight margins and competition getting hot, there’s absolutely no room for screwy customer experience.For example I was in my neighborhood grocer today looking for a can of tomato sauce. I couldn’t find it. I asked the cashier at the customer service desk and she directed me back to the aisle where I already was. That One only had tomato sauce in a jar. I decided to leave because I did not have the time or the energy to hunt down tomato sauce in a can.I would like to believe that I amNot the only customer who ended up leaving the store not being able to find what they wanted. But they do such a good job asking you when you leave did you find everything you wanted sir"

Maybe Leone will buy some more or an acquisition will come in a take us to humm who likes wants analytics? Cisco ?
Subscription Rev up 20% in a short quarter.
Should pop over 45-55 after beating expectations. Today was very low volume and I just had to double down. We may see 38 tomorrow. Just place high sell orders so the price goes up as it’s usually light trading going into a holiday weekend. We will be rewarded big next week and beyond. I’m holding half for over 60 and the rest over 100.
very strong company
Nice Home Depot deal should bring the stock above 35 dollar..
"The fact that it was $50 in February, it makes a great acquisition for CRM companies like Salesforce or Microsoft (Dynamics). If Medallia were to sell the company, I would presume it will be a huge premium compared to the current pricing around $30....."

@arimir you twitted a few hours ago: “48% of investors are shorting $MDLAWe could see a Short Squeeze and stock pumping +20% anytime...” and now you post a picture of the titanic. Can you help us to understand that inconsistency?
Another good report. Steadily making progress.
The shorts can only short medallia for so long. $50 price target for this stock in 12 months.
Sold. Glad I waited. Nice 10% gain in less than a week
"The drop today is senseless. If you’re in above $34 hold tight, it’ll bounce back. This dip is just profit taking"
Miss or beat today?
Is everyone ready to see $40 post earnings? Wrap your mind around that because it's our future. And others will catch on to how vital data and metrics are to achieving high customer satisfaction!! And Medallia is the solution!
Strong one month chart
"Health care vertical enormous. Telemedicine has seen explosive growth and quality control by useless administrators is around the corner. The reason for the sudden strength, IMO. And justified."

With today's close (09/17/20) MDLA has sold off almost exactly 1/3rd (33.33%) from its high of $0.20 on 09/02/20. That was two weeks ago!
"Cc was good, stock will go up"
$NOW part 2!
This is gonna bounce back. Doubled up my shares.
This will be 24 sooner then later - it will continue to trend lower market is hot today imagine another correction this will be low 20s before it recovers
I think LivePerson is a better investment than Medallia.
Someone has an estimate of the size of the contracts published in Yahoo Finance articles?
Worth the wait.
What’s your guess on the opening price Monday and the closing price on Friday of next week?
bought at open
Medallia is down 9.21% to 18.63
Big beat all around..After hours is thin volume noise..watch this be green tommorow

Excellent company and management. Reminds me of $TTD in terms of how they are adapting to future markets and capturing share. Glad to see new partnership this morning - would be shocked if this isn’t a 100$ name by EOY
this we'll be the better ipo this week!!!
The analysts' have been reducing their EPS estimates over the last several months and that goes for next year as well. Anyone recall any mention of this by mgmt?

What just happened? Big sharp jump on high volume!
Great company with a great perspective
Does anyone know why this is going down if they reported such good earnings?
BA 29.00/33.00 and this was supposed to price between 16-18 lol
Why isn’t moving irrespective of multiple good contracts?
Mark my words....back to 30+ in 2 days.....this is the cheapest SAAS and cloud play out there. Trading at only 7X next year revenue....where everyone else is on 15+X
MDLA reached an all time high at 41.00
What is wrong with this company ? It seem like the favorite of most business companies for whatever they provide! Always have good earnings and forecast to excel. Have high hopes for stock price to ignite in the near future.
i got 1500 shares at 26.25 . Lets see how this one goes
THIS IS A SCAM COMPANY BECAREFUL THIS WILL FALL INTO SINGLE DIGITS
Breakout.Sustained move over $33.
MDLA is up 8.44% to 18.25
Does anyone know why this went down on such a good earnings call? The stock seems pretty undervalued?
HI guys. Where do you see the company in 5 years in terms of revenue and market size?
"Why is anyone selling this for under $34?! Aren't you guaranteed to get $34 in September? Are they concerned that Thoma Bravo might back out of the deal, or that shareholders would not approve ?"
a hidden gem! Weird sooo quiet at the board :)
Medallia is down 6.51% to 22.10
"253 Institutions held 94.64% of Shares, so no worries, it will go 40+"
Why’s it going down today? Any news
Looks like a good entry point for an opening position.Just discovered this company in Kiplinger magazine and was endorsed as a longterm/secular investment..
MDLA is up 7.19% to 19.60
I am left handed
"After this drop, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strategic buyer step in. Going forward, companies need real time understanding of the customer experience and MDLA's purchase of LivingLens helps make that possible. I'm long MDLA so biased but does seem like a good strategic fit for companies like Oracle, IBM, etc."
any upgrades this should bounce back
Any constructive feedback on today's dip?
"All big company have there own data analysts, they will loose clients with time, buy director insider buy they can’t keep their price up long time. They need profit, earning "
"Medallia has been differentiating itself with its AI-enhanced service. Even in a less-than-ideal 2020, subscription revenue growth has remained above 20% every quarter -- including a 22% year-over-year increase in Q3. Medallia does still operate at a slight loss (free cash flow was negative $26 million in the first nine months of the year), but it's on a clear path to profitability in an increasingly important segment of the software world. As more human interaction moves online, I think Medallia has room to run. And at just shy of 11 times 12-month sales, shares look like an attractive value for the long-haul."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medallia-reports-record-second-quarter-200500948.html
I feel it...$$$
Coming back up now.
"Earnings tomorrow 4:30pm est. If is good and it should be and we don't have a market sell off, this should pop and run to $35 easy"
Back to june
Anything below $27 is a buy zone.
Will this break 32/share??
A reward for us longs.
"Another quarter of losses, and they are expecting 15 to 20% more losses next quarter, almost 40 million dollars. That's the reason for the drop. Earnings mean nothing if you have a loss and you're not making a profit"
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
next week 50..high volume..going up!
"MDLA -=-=_=_ WE sold medallia , and buy FSLY + BETTER FOR LONG, add more today"
it's crashing after hours 32 dollar :((. CC must have gone bad..!
Both Bloomberg and CNBC reporting potential sale.... That makes 2 sources now
"This appears to be one of the new new things...pure play on experience analysis and management...and they seem to continually announce new accounts. Let’s see what the next quarter brings...with their share count, I would not be surprised to see a secondary within 3-4 months nor $85 - 100 if they can maintain their tempo of new accounts."
added a lot during dip. nice.

"We have been using Medallia at my Job for years now (local cable company), so I got in at $43.07, not thinking it would just keep tanking since the day I got in. I do feel that since they are getting contracts with other businesses, this will hopefully be back up in the mid 40's after a few quarters. GLTA"
Over $32 million in losses. No wonder they use non-GAAP
Where is information about IPO MDLA?
"Can't believe all the pumpers on this board, at the height of a market bubble, when the whole market is insanely inflated, and this stock is hyper-inflated. The fact that no one took profits after a 50% run up and that so many are expecting another 50% up from here is just a blatant testament to the out of control greed bordering on stupidity that has seized hold of the market thanks to criminal Fed pumping."
Why qualtrics is not crashing after results and medallia is? Medallia's market cap is even much lower!

Medallia stock halted for volatility after sale talks report
"$34 is undervalued. The share was above $40 just a few short months ago, and considering comps like Qualtrics, this should be a strong quarter for MDLA. I'd put fair price at $40-45"
"Fortunately I didn't chase this one higher. An opportunity to build a position, assuming this tailspin is mostly the result of market shenanigans."
