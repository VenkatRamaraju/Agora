Needham analyst Scott Berg assigned a Buy rating to Medallia today and set a price target of $40.00. The company’s shares closed last Thursday at $35.13.
a screaming buy now!
"With $34 the offering price, selling below that is not wise, particularly with the provision “go shop” provision in the agreement. If no higher bidders found, at least you get $34!"
BA 29.00/33.00 and this was supposed to price between 16-18 lol
Looks like a good entry point for an opening position.Just discovered this company in Kiplinger magazine and was endorsed as a longterm/secular investment..
Order in @ $30

40 times oversubscribed. Gonna price at $26- $30
A big win! U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Selects Medallia to Understand the Experience and Sentiment Across Mission Critical Services. Should drive stock price to 50 and higher..
"Why is anyone selling this for under $34?! Aren't you guaranteed to get $34 in September? Are they concerned that Thoma Bravo might back out of the deal, or that shareholders would not approve ?"
Any thoughts as to why the big decline one day before earnings?
Since this is trading at only $0.05 below the buyout price and closing isn't anticipated until year end (?) does this mean that the market anticipates a bit more as the final buyout number? I guess that $0.05 for two and a half months annualizes to about 4% so it could just indicate people parking cash in a safe haven that pays something. If there was actual buzz about a higher price then it would be trading higher than it is I suppose.
Stock should go up..50% below new PT of Citi :)
"When does the ""go shop"" period end?"
More losses. Glad I got out just under $34 after buyout was announced. Put the pile of cash to good use!
Does anyone care that they beat
