Since this is trading at only $0.05 below the buyout price and closing isn't anticipated until year end (?) does this mean that the market anticipates a bit more as the final buyout number? I guess that $0.05 for two and a half months annualizes to about 4% so it could just indicate people parking cash in a safe haven that pays something. If there was actual buzz about a higher price then it would be trading higher than it is I suppose.
"Bought at 36$, sold the half at 34,60. Great Investment so far"
"I feel so warm; fuzzy; almost tingly….our ceo receives great honor and is lauded with the laurel wreath…now, what about our share price…whatcha gonna do ’bout that bub????"
The analysts' have been reducing their EPS estimates over the last several months and that goes for next year as well. Anyone recall any mention of this by mgmt?
Medallia...double down! Giving money away today.
Curious to hear how the CEO’s tone will be on this call. Stock would be in mid 40s if he shows any sign of positive emotion
Nice Home Depot deal should bring the stock above 35 dollar..
Back in the tank in Premarket.Shorted 25 percent yesterday down about 5 percent from Friday
"Didn't know what to make of this company, but I took a stake anyway. I'm a believer now."
"That's better , now keep rising"
"The lockup period ended in Jan for IPO shareholders and a massive amount of new share volume is in play. We're seeing a selloff based off fear, not fundamentals. Stay strong longs!"
just bought 1700@32.66 and my stop loss @32. Worth the gamble in my opinion. SaaS companies always overvalued in takeover.
"Seriously here to those who know the company, why the massive loss this past Qtr ?"
$33+ next week$40+ Christmas gift
Up 10% from days low
Credit Suisse really screwed MDLA today. The stock was trading over $33 Pre market today after MDLA reported a record quarter. CS lowered their price target from $42 to $37 and the stock has been trading down since. I don't understand the $5 drop of their target after a great quarter
it's crashing after hours 32 dollar :((. CC must have gone bad..!
Stock should go up..50% below new PT of Citi :)
"With $34 the offering price, selling below that is not wise, particularly with the provision “go shop” provision in the agreement. If no higher bidders found, at least you get $34!"
So many big deals medallia is making!
Again a BIG contract with US government! MDLA to the MOON
What’s your guess on the opening price Monday and the closing price on Friday of next week?
This baby will be up in few days. Algorithms are selling it. Smart traders are picking up bargain deals.
BA 29.00/33.00 and this was supposed to price between 16-18 lol
Over 12000 puts just went through for June 19 17.50 puts.
"IPNFF up 80% today.... This is an Augmented reality company that is changing marketing. way undervalued, check it out if you like , the website is futuristic"
"Health care vertical enormous. Telemedicine has seen explosive growth and quality control by useless administrators is around the corner. The reason for the sudden strength, IMO. And justified."
Nice move today this stock will be 70 by the end of 2019
Why down after hours
"Medallia has been differentiating itself with its AI-enhanced service. Even in a less-than-ideal 2020, subscription revenue growth has remained above 20% every quarter -- including a 22% year-over-year increase in Q3. Medallia does still operate at a slight loss (free cash flow was negative $26 million in the first nine months of the year), but it's on a clear path to profitability in an increasingly important segment of the software world. As more human interaction moves online, I think Medallia has room to run. And at just shy of 11 times 12-month sales, shares look like an attractive value for the long-haul."
"My guess is that at the equity firm that wants to buy them, at around 3PM a memo went around that if you aren't in the office on Saturday, then don't even bother showing up on Sunday. They are rushing around to lock the deal down before the stock goes up any higher. Monday morning is going to be interesting."
Medallia another big agreement! Where will it stop? :)
a hidden gem! Weird sooo quiet at the board :)
Y-FINANCE showing down 10% premarket. Anyone seeing anything?
Im just waiting for the right buying opportunity!!
Why’s it going down today? Any news
Medallia stock halted for volatility after sale talks report
When is earnings date?
I dont like the fact that the CEO sells shares before the quarterly results
Another good report. Steadily making progress.
@arimir you twitted a few hours ago: “48% of investors are shorting $MDLAWe could see a Short Squeeze and stock pumping +20% anytime...” and now you post a picture of the titanic. Can you help us to understand that inconsistency?
"This Arimir is funny. He comments, then likes his own comments. Now that he’s lost money, he gives every positive comment a thumbs down. You still have a chance to get in for the rebound tomorrow to make up your losses...buyout target for sure in the future, but they are good to go on their own for a few quarters to build shareholder value. I’m sure some of the large players would love to acquire them and understand the next few months would be an opportunity to make a move. Either way, longs will be handsomely rewarded. Was shocked today at the chance to double down. Still have dry powder for more."
Zero volume 
STRONG action this week. One more knockout qtr and we really pick up steam!!!
Bullish pattern! Jumping in !
"Their pace of contracts is a bit astonishing. If they can maintain this, the next two quarterly reports should be impressive."
Needham Issues a Buy Rating on Medallia (MDLA) | Analyst Ratingshttps://www.analystratings.com/articles/needham-issues-a-buy-rating-on-medallia-mdla/
@Arimir - why do you always delete your posts? Leave your post history so others can judge your skill. Deleting just demonstrates that you try to scare the price into tanking
"Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $39 at Craig-Hallum After Non Deal Roadshow, from 35..Good sign!"
June 2 is not a good time to report earnings. Momentum for these tech stocks is almost over
This is a $15 stock..IPO supposed to be at $17..bumped to $22 pumped stock to $37 shorted havelyback to $15No way this company will make any money..$15 all over within a year
"Looking for a monster quarter but who knows how the stock will react. Either way, solid choice for the long term"
"Earnings tomorrow 4:30pm est. If is good and it should be and we don't have a market sell off, this should pop and run to $35 easy"
this is going nowhete. i am out but gl
Subscription based revenue grew by 17% and total revenue grew by 22% year over year. Around 94% institutional ownership. Nothing to worry about here
Any constructive feedback on today's dip?
"agreed. not much of a drop on Friday which was about where it should have ended up. We will move up strong into the close and will likely be over 30 tomorrow but in a couple of days for sure. whoever is selling, thanks for the cheap shares."
Where are the buyers?
"I bought Medallia just a while ago as a long term investment and now there probably will be a buy out.I don't really like that, even when I could make some profit..."
Any thoughts as to why the big decline one day before earnings?
"“I’m pleased with our performance in Q1. In addition to record subscription revenue we had our highest number of quarterly go-lives ever, as we added more new enterprise and mid-market customers,” said Leslie Stretch, President and CEO of Medallia. “We have more sales capacity and more product than at any other time in our history and more industry analysts validating our innovation leadership. We have strong geographic and vertical end-markets and more mature and effective alliances. Following record attendance at our Experience 21 conference we are focused on execution for the rest of the year and we see an opportunity to accelerate our subscription growth.”"
"Do the opposite of what arimire says, this stock is alteryx like"
"Key takeawaysThere's a lot to like about Medallia, especially after the stock has shed ~25% off recent highs. In my view, the company's slowing growth rates are counterbalanced by the fact that Medallia is vastly improving its margin profile, as well as the possibility that it's giving up lower-margin professional services revenues to third-party resellers.When we consider the fact that Medallia's closest competitor got bought out at twice Medallia's current valuation, Medallia looks like an incredibly compelling opportunity. Use the dip as a well-timed buying opportunity."
Time to buy
"It's not insider selling. It's typically selling shares in conjunction with these senior executives exercising stock options, which creates taxable income. The IRS requires a 25% tax payment on the value of the shares and they allow for an easy way to sell some of the shares to pay for those taxes. It's all done in one simple process to the executives."
"Bought in at 40, added whenever there was a dip and now sitting at avg price 32.5."
A big win! U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Selects Medallia to Understand the Experience and Sentiment Across Mission Critical Services. Should drive stock price to 50 and higher..
A screaming buy stock! 40 dollar target!
No bottom here.Looks like somebody wants out
Medallia is down 8.14% to 31.08
why the drop? overbought a few days ago?
"When does the ""go shop"" period end?"
New partnership confirms its going to 100 by end of year! :)
Can someone share the source
Downward pressure on news of convertible bond issue. Good to raise capital during this low interest rate environment.
Shakeout before the buyout!
"Looking for an entry point, but can’t seem to find a bottom. Let’s hope this week, but the free fall has me nervous."
"This appears to be one of the new new things...pure play on experience analysis and management...and they seem to continually announce new accounts. Let’s see what the next quarter brings...with their share count, I would not be surprised to see a secondary within 3-4 months nor $85 - 100 if they can maintain their tempo of new accounts."
"253 Institutions held 94.64% of Shares, so no worries, it will go 40+"
"Director Douglas M. Leone acquired 399,265 shares of this software application company, paying $28.12 per share for a total amount of $11.23 million.Doug Leone is a billionaire venture capitalist who has been with the premier VC firm Sequoia Capital for the last 31 years after stints at Sun Microsystems and HP. He made these purchases in his direct account and also owns several million additional shares indirectly via Sequoia and other entities. These purchases were filed with the SEC after hours on Thursday 9/12 and investors bid the stock up more than 14% on Friday 9/15.Once you decode Medallia's jargon-filled product platform page that is filled with phrases like ""neural network-based predictive models"" and ""fine grain data permissions"", you begin to understand that Medallia is a brand and identity management company. Unfortunately, the company's product pages appear to be written by geeks for geeks. I say this coming from a data analysis background having run an artificial intelligence project to analyze SEC filings.The post-earnings reaction to Medallia is a little surprising as the company posted a smaller than expected non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share compared to estimates of a loss of 15 cents per share. GAAP loss for Q2 was $38.45 million on revenue of $95.67 million, which grew 27% year-over-year. Most of the GAAP loss can be attributed to $35.18 million in stock-based compensation expense as is common with technology companies.Revenue growth is accelerating as you can see from the chart on the right, and the company claims it has less than 1% market penetration in a $68 billion market. Medallia generated positive cash flow from operation in two out of the last three quarters.Overall, the company looks interesting and worth exploring further. If the recent investment style shift from growth to value continues, this cloud technology company provide an attractive point of entry."
New agreement! New markets! 
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4290514-medallia-buy-dip
$27.20 close today? 
"We have been using Medallia at my Job for years now (local cable company), so I got in at $43.07, not thinking it would just keep tanking since the day I got in. I do feel that since they are getting contracts with other businesses, this will hopefully be back up in the mid 40's after a few quarters. GLTA"
Announcement after close? :):):):):)
getting tired of this stock
Bank of america initiated with a buy! Target 50!
Finally going big up..up to 40 this time for real
Anything below $27 is a buy zone.
Full speed ahead baby! Go baby go!
"I believe MDLA is an acquisition target. Just my opinion, but SAP recently bought Qualtrics for 8B. Medallia seems to have a better suite of services. If Oracle, IBM, Salesforce, etc were to pay 8B for MDLA, the price would be $66 per share - about an 80% increase from here."
Hope this can go back to 30s
Strong buy with price targets up to 52 - overreaction it is))
Good day.
"The drop today is senseless. If you’re in above $34 hold tight, it’ll bounce back. This dip is just profit taking"
Decent quarterly and down over $1 a share.Typical Wall Street manipulation.
"fundamentally, company has great prospects, long term. Short term risk is more systemic/generic in nature (covid economic concerns, election year e.t.c). Overall tech correction followed by issuance of senior notes (potential dilution) right after does make the last week look terrible. As @Jim , from MDLA standpoint, good time to raise funds in cheap credit environment...had a position at @25- got out at 27 missed the whole run to 40 so didn't time that well... good stock if horizon is greater than 6 months"
"IMO, the sale ""rumor"" must be true. Management would've at least issued a statement indicating they are not selling if indeed they weren't planning on it."
Coming back to life now
Both Bloomberg and CNBC reporting potential sale.... That makes 2 sources now
40 times oversubscribed. Gonna price at $26- $30
Should be up big....
Strong one month chart
"Medallia Inc. (NYSE: MDLA), the global leader in experience management, announced today that it will report financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 on Thursday, September 5, 2019 after the market closes. Medallia will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT on the same day."
no vol a/h not concerned glta tomorrow will reverse up
"On way to 40 , then 50..many new deals.."
"After this drop, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strategic buyer step in. Going forward, companies need real time understanding of the customer experience and MDLA's purchase of LivingLens helps make that possible. I'm long MDLA so biased but does seem like a good strategic fit for companies like Oracle, IBM, etc."
"I'm out. Sold during week in this 33.60 range. Maybe they can find a better offer, but I wanted to raise some cash. Good luck."
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.69
"$34 is undervalued. The share was above $40 just a few short months ago, and considering comps like Qualtrics, this should be a strong quarter for MDLA. I'd put fair price at $40-45"
"Strong company, a bit undervalued compared to other public B2B-SaaS companies. Once volume stabilizes (after lockup expiration) shall do up."
"The fact that it was $50 in February, it makes a great acquisition for CRM companies like Salesforce or Microsoft (Dynamics). If Medallia were to sell the company, I would presume it will be a huge premium compared to the current pricing around $30....."
Anyone know why it is down again today?
Breakout.Sustained move over $33.
bought some this morning on the dip - great buying opportunity after earnings report as it beat both earnings per share and revenue numbers with raised guidance. Market manipulation at its finest - buy the dip!
Medallia Inc. (MDLA) PT Raised to $45 at Truist Securities
It will recover tomo similar to what $WORK did today... last time to buy at this level... hurry up
"Back on it's way to 40, where it belongs!"
Does anyone care that they beat
hope u bought in yesterday. this will go up massively
"Why is anyone selling this for under $34?! Aren't you guaranteed to get $34 in September? Are they concerned that Thoma Bravo might back out of the deal, or that shareholders would not approve ?"
Looks like a good entry point for an opening position.Just discovered this company in Kiplinger magazine and was endorsed as a longterm/secular investment..
"First it was arimire now Barros, a couple debbie downers, and negative nancys"
Bloombery reporting possible sale of the company..... Hellalujah!!!!!!!
Excellent company and management. Reminds me of $TTD in terms of how they are adapting to future markets and capturing share. Glad to see new partnership this morning - would be shocked if this isn’t a 100$ name by EOY
"Medallia (NYSE:MDLA) stock increased by 2.8% to $33.0. At the close, Medallia's trading volume reached 158.4K shares. This is 10.55% of its average volume over the last 100 days. The company's market cap stands at $5.2 billion. (Benzinga)"
Great company with a great perspective
nept sndl ebonI'm the Sektor you heard about
Update! $27.50 close today
Mark my words....back to 30+ in 2 days.....this is the cheapest SAAS and cloud play out there. Trading at only 7X next year revenue....where everyone else is on 15+X
Medallia reached an all time high at 45.17
"Good luck to everyone for today's ER. I think MDLA has a great future. Consistent rev growth, etc. Seems fairly valued given other stocks have much higher price/sales, or P/E ratios, but unless they beat EPS, Revs AND give good guidance, we may pullback over the short term. I've had 3 others in last week that dropped more than 20% UGH!!"
what do people thing after hours up or down? thanks
Do you guys think it will go up more tomorrow for earnings or not?
It’s still overvalued with a market cap almost $5 billion
Is everyone ready to see $40 post earnings? Wrap your mind around that because it's our future. And others will catch on to how vital data and metrics are to achieving high customer satisfaction!! And Medallia is the solution!
Trouncing the other SaaS shares I watch.
"I wish I bought more yesterday,,"
Will this break 32/share??
Stock on way to 100 by end of year!
added a lot during dip. nice.
"Above $40/sh and MDLA breaks out of its listing price, keep this in mind as that mark is not far away. With earnings approaching I can see $45 real soon."
"Another quarter of losses, and they are expecting 15 to 20% more losses next quarter, almost 40 million dollars. That's the reason for the drop. Earnings mean nothing if you have a loss and you're not making a profit"
a screaming buy now!
"Cc was good, stock will go up"
More losses. Glad I got out just under $34 after buyout was announced. Put the pile of cash to good use!
"I am a buyer at $21, same price others paid for."
90.44 % Held by Institutions . I also know CVS uses Medallia . I bought it last month when I saw medallia on all the forms I received when I got my vaccine
New agreement with Slack!
I feel it...$$$
Nice bounce back from the dip. It'll be 35+ very quickly after mid 33 range IMO
Not much reaction.... -0.1%
What just happened? Big sharp jump on high volume!
Why is it up today
Why the drop?
C'mon MDLA lets go back to $26!
next week 50..high volume..going up!
Maybe a class action suite is brewing and insiders are bailing.
It is really tiring to look at this stock
"WoW! Medallia keeps on signing new huge contracts in past month,SoftbankPizz hutCommSay insuranceCanada Automobile Associationservice Now Certification for It and ServiceNow StoresAmerican Axel Under Canvass Unbelievable growth"
Lot of money will be made by those who invest in MDLA
no volume considering the float-this will bounce back
"I think this company is kinda big deal, which many people are still sleeping on."

I hope it can go back to 32 again. So I can get my money back on the false breakout.
