RNG is king of wasting PR's on big red market days.
do they now see what the value of Vonage is. $RNG grew 7% on the news of the rejection of the offer by $ZM. RNG has revenues similar like VG. only RNG is worth 20 bl and VG 4 bl.
"Incredible, how an excellent stock turned its path an became a piece of #$%^^&*"
We need to cross 232 for a bull run.
"Loaded more on Friday morning and yes, lost some money. But, I believe in Rng and hope it will come back to where it was and keep going up, up and up."
"Looks like shorts have been adding into this most recent advance, almost 10% of the float is now short. With good reason, this has been a great short, until it isn't."
"Alright I took the bate, back in for the long haul, let her rip."
What’s wrong with this stock? Growth no longer matters?
"super strong support at $229, im buying hopefully it can hold"
"Passive selling down here, gonna need a good flush before this thing can start moving higher, tax harvesting won't help either, things are pretty bleak right now."
"Morningstar just moved RNG to 5 star stockAt theses levels, it’s very attractive"
RNG is not a covid stock lol. Covid started in March 2020 in US. RNG was 235+ in Feb 2020 itself.
Why the sudden upward movement? Will this be $275 by the end of the year.
@JJ nice call on 232 resistance level. A close above 240 over the next couple of days would be good.
"Hubs releases identical PR to RNG this morning, up 10%, RNG bout to turn red."
52% down from it high. This was overvalued before (at 450). Business hasn't change yet. Easy buy and hold.
October will change fortune for us. Earnings month so be patient till then. GL.
"Earnings are Nov 8th, we should get some upward movement in the next couple weeks."
"IMO, this is heading to 120-130."
Nothing wrong with the stock. Its September sell off. Watch for last year chart as well.
