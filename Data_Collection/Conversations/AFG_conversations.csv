AFGE reached an all time low at $23.82
Picked up another 100 shares
"Buy and never sell. This company is extremely well managed. Pay attention to what the management and executives do. Vito, the gc, bought shares just under $100 bc he knew this sale would go through. The company is owned by a family that controls about 40% of the outstanding shares. It is their cash generating machine and they frequently pay special dividends, usually at least once per year. They are worth many billions and you should own this company LONG TERM!"
ex..dividend..is.june7....shareholders..on..record..june..8th
"Just got 60 shares, and I plan on holding for 5 years"
Great American is the lead insurer in the Miami building collapse. Although reinsurance and excess liab polices will help mitigate fallout still big deal
Do I still have time to buy shares to get the special dividend or was the last day to purchase Friday?
"Used to own AFG - only 600 shares, but it is obvious that they are more interested in lining up their own pockets rather than stockholders. While I give them credit for the end of year payout, it is absurd how top executives are taking care of themselves with huge bonuses while paying stockholders a low rate of return. Compare them to PRU and PFG. Want to purchase more as they are a solid company, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the future when they do this."
"Anyone else buying this company? Good dividend track record, good liquidity, bought back shares after the drop, and trading at a relatively good discount. Post-COVID, this should be set to increase in value, and reinstate the special dividend."
what’s with the price ?
Keep holding. This stock doesn't start to rise until lunch.
just sold my shares but will buy again soon on a dip to get the divided coming up

Artificial propping up of this stock. Worker's Compensation expectations overstated based on current job market. CA insurer subsidiary is heavily engaged in restuarant and food service industry sector. Beware!
any reason why is going down?
big drop
just bought back in for thr dividend. buy today or your too late
why is going down? no news...
Nice special dividend.
"i'm thinking of adding this to my dividend growth portfolio. 70 shares for now. Any reasons why I shouldn't? Looks like it's going to go up above it's pre-covid highs which leaves about 30% growth potential, plus decent divs."
"can I give my $14 ""dividend"" back??"
"Summary of latest news: Zacks #1, annual dividend increased from $2.00 to $2.24, 16 straight years of dividend hikes, two upward revisions of earning estimates."

"Shareholders who purchased AFG prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG) will begin trading ex-dividend on June 07, 2021.Based on this, Looks like I missed the boat on FRIDAY to purchase this."
If i buy this stock monday morning would i get the dividend as the ex dividend is Tuesday? I noticed my bank broker app i have the purchase date and 2 later is the settlement date?
Positive earnings surprise and the price gets slammed. I guess I just don't know how to invest anymore.
Stumbled upon this gem in the depths of the pandemic and it keeps impressing. Another great quarter along with 16$ of special divvys .
"After today's large drop, gained it back and then some after-hours after the $4 special dividend news. Interesting timing considering the stock's performance over the last several weeks. Might mitigate some of the general downward pressure I think the market will continue to experience in the short term."
Why is more than dividend income falling? How long does it take to recover?
AFG sold their Annuity Business to MassMutual for $3.5 billion cash. AFG said they expect to recognize a gain of $620 million to $690 million on the sale upon closing. Great management.
How many shares does Craig need to sell to keep this soccer team afloat? It's not like Messi is on the team!
