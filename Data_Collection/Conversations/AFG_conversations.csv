"Used to own AFG - only 600 shares, but it is obvious that they are more interested in lining up their own pockets rather than stockholders. While I give them credit for the end of year payout, it is absurd how top executives are taking care of themselves with huge bonuses while paying stockholders a low rate of return. Compare them to PRU and PFG. Want to purchase more as they are a solid company, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the future when they do this."
Stumbled upon this gem in the depths of the pandemic and it keeps impressing. Another great quarter along with 16$ of special divvys .

"Buy and never sell. This company is extremely well managed. Pay attention to what the management and executives do. Vito, the gc, bought shares just under $100 bc he knew this sale would go through. The company is owned by a family that controls about 40% of the outstanding shares. It is their cash generating machine and they frequently pay special dividends, usually at least once per year. They are worth many billions and you should own this company LONG TERM!"

"i'm thinking of adding this to my dividend growth portfolio. 70 shares for now. Any reasons why I shouldn't? Looks like it's going to go up above it's pre-covid highs which leaves about 30% growth potential, plus decent divs."
"After today's large drop, gained it back and then some after-hours after the $4 special dividend news. Interesting timing considering the stock's performance over the last several weeks. Might mitigate some of the general downward pressure I think the market will continue to experience in the short term."
