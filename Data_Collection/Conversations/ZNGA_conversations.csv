"ZNGA is much much better than GME, fundamentally.. ZNGA $30--$60. Minimum should be 10 times Revenue, that's $30, and $$60+ to trade close to other Online Gaming stocks 30 times Revenue.. ZNGA is cheap is H##L"
"Facebook, Apple, TTWO, Activision, Amazon, GameStop, Twitter,a and even Roblox can buyout Zynga. Beware you will see $13-$20 offering."
"“Our multi-year strategy of growing our live services, launching new games and investing in global expansion continues to position Zynga for growth.”"
Probably closing the gap to 9.40 in #WISH. Look at what #ZNGA is doing.
Bought some more @ 8.78
I have both PSFE and ZNGA. Just waiting to see who will cross $9 First.
Lets get this through the 9 today
Zynga is a huge company with lots of job openings.......
breaking through 9$ go go go
Back to over 10 in the next 30 days.
Zynga bought a Chinese company which gives them more access to their massive Chinese market...
"“Today, we are thrilled to officially welcome the Chartboost team to Zygna, as well as announce an agreement to acquire China-based Starlark - the talented developers behind the hit mobile franchise, Golf Rival.”"
"Zynga said that it plans to launch Merge Dragons in China, and it has received some important approvals for doing so.China’s regulators will only permit externally produced games to be launched in China if they go through a certification process and receive an an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) publishing license from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA).Merge Dragons has received that, and it is preparing for launch in China this year. Created by Gram Games, this popular puzzle adventure pioneered the “merge” gameplay mechanic. It will be released on iOS and Android localized in Simplified Mandarin."

This is a huge exaggeration of the earnings “miss”. Keep buying the dips. Way more upside than downside. if you agree
"Doubled down on the dip. Mobile gaming will only continue to grow, as will ZNGA."
Traders....let’s transform znga into another GME amd make one another rich!$$$$$$$
"@Flynn...I been in Market since 2001. I been following ZNGA others. Now ZNGA has proven track record, mgmt has strongly proven by well diversified, grown Revenue 300% to $3 BILLION from 740mm in 2016..Now I am in. Credit to the Management, they answered Wllst, YES, ZNGA is grown, and now much much more than Facebook Farmville only.. ZNGA is Online Gaming King, a force with muscle..My humble advice now to mgmt is, #1.. SAVE CASH, pile up CASH to buy out future STRUGGLING bad decision makers.. #2...Grow in Online Gaming Platform into DKNG, SKLZ, sell your own fat margin Merchandise like CRSR.. and ZNGA will be on path to $$50--$100 BILLION Co.."
Pinterest and Zynga have the same revs but Pinterest has a $35 billion market cap...
High short interest with about five or six days to cover. Each week short interest declines so I see price rising from here. I’m holding this baby.
$9 billion market cap with $2.5 in sales and money in the bank...undervalued.
"CNBC just pumped it, unusual call volume"
"I was expecting a profit this quarter, but I do wonder why they moved their earnings date to Thursday. It's always been on Wednesday ever since I started with this stock well over three years ago. Either way, disappointing to see the dive into earnings (which is pretty typical for Zynga). The catalysts for this stock are still amazing. The chartboost acquisition doesn't even close until this quarter (not sure the exact date or if perhaps it has closed by now)... that *is* very significant. The new Star Wars game has the potential to be massive. Just look at what games crush the top grossing charts. Fornite, CoD, PUBG, etc... Battle Royale games. Throw the Star Wars theme on it and it will have a major audience. The future is bright... the near-term is annoying."
Hope this will cross 9 today. Grabbed the stock ay $7.87 when it had a steep fall on the day result was announced. Glad i brought that day.
"This is still a buy. Ok, analysts reduced the price targets, but current price is a great deal. Buy and hold."
Bought at $8.30.. will hold for short term and see before adding
Strongly believe BUYING ZNGA today will be one of the very best timing plays on this stock.Believe holding for at least 4 months to 1 year will prove to be an excellent investment.Believe by December 2021 ZNGA will be at least $10-$12 per share and Q1 $14 per share.
10M shares were bought in 10 minutes.
"Second day in a rowI Million+ shares of ZNGA traded AH.After-Hours Volume 1,252,466"
What did Najarian say. I was on the phone.
there is still some juice on this stock. it may go all the way to 9.15 by the end of August. but i think i missed 7.90 level.
"DKNG, SKLZ trading 16-20 times Revenue, ZNGA CHEAP below 3 times Revenue, has $300 Million Cash Flow.. DKNG, SKLZ burning cash $100+ million..Pl, correct me if I am wrong"
ZNGA would be a good target for an activist investor. Their revenue is growing yet it hardly falls to the bottom line due to excessive stock based compensation. Worth a medium term ride to the 11 area.
I bought the dip but this stock makes me queasy.
$2 billion in revs and $10 bill market cap.... undervalued....
"Don't forget that ZNGA continues to buy companies that are adding to the bottom line. Once they have their stable of companies and especially when they release farmville 3 in the 4th quarter, we go up. They are burning cash to buy companies to be more profitable. They are reinvesting to one day have a much greater revenue stream and positive earnings. I am even on this stock and when it fell back to 8 I bought more. If you are day trading this, good luck. There are far better companies to day trade. I bet I make more money holding this than any day trader who puts in a limit to buy at 7.79 and then it doesn't trigger. Just buy it at market and turn your back for a few years!!"
"ZNGA nearly SAME Revenue as ABNB $3 BILLION.. But ABNB Valuation $100 BILLION almost.. Unbelievable. All the online gaming stocks 16--30 times Revenue, ZNGA is way too cheap anyway you look at it.. ZNGA Cash flow positive, keeps pulling up CASH.."
"ZNGA is now trading cheaper than 2016. Revenue up 300%, value up only 200%.. ZNGA Revenue estimated to be near $3 BILLION vs $741mm 2016.ZNGA Stock $8 today vs $3 2016/2017...Today ZNGA is diversified, stable spread out business, proven business model, Gaming is only spreading like wild fire..Out of all the Gaming, ZNGA IS THE CHEAPEST..And today ZNGA Revenue is huge. Advertising Revenue is growing. From here ZNGA has the Revenue Size mass to Muscle around, increase margin, buy out and grow, grow their footprint and grow organically too..I bought 5000 here"
"Zynga is a potential take over target, gaming is a very popular and growing trend. I would not be surprised if ZNGA gets bought out in the near future...."
stock would be $25.00 if the Company would stop diluted.. 1.5 billion float....
PINCUS Should Buy Back The 5.4 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock He Sold A Few Days Before The Earnings Were Released.
"ZNGA huge Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION) vs $740mm 2016.. Well diversified, a force in the industry, proven business model.. Today ZNGA selling for much much cheaper than 2016."
Need to break through 8.88 resistance level for upward movement.
Best opportunity to buy Zynga. This is a no brainer folks! Buy the dip big!
"ZNGA Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION). 2016 rev was $740mm tinny and with huge question one truck horse Farmville, Wllst wanted to know if it would survive out of FACEBOOK ONLY FARVILLE.. Today ZNGA is mature well diversified, fat margine, cash flow positive, spread its wings in the most profitable fields of Gaming Online.. Reven of $$3 BILLION is huge, no Brick-and-mortar huge overhead.. Rev of 3 BILLION can easily turn into BILLION PROFIT for online software service buss.. And keep growing.."
lots of option buying today... get ready for a run to 10-11
"Wish I had not recently taken on my first mortgage. This was a steal at $8. Was shocked at the reaction to a minor decrease in guidance following quarter after quarter after quarter of increased guidance. I think Covid actually hurt this stock. It was growing nice and steadily before the pandemic. Now everyone is so focused on ""less time home to play games, blah blah blah."" People aren't going to stop playing games because they are slightly less restricted. More so, the problem is an oversaturation of the game market. That is my only concern with this company. Neither Gram Games nor Small Giants follow-ups have come anywhere near their hits. I feel a ton of contingency was paid early on that may fizzle out right when the payments are done. That said, as a side note, Harry Potter should be trouncing Candy Crush. For the life of me, I cannot believe that game still sits in the top couple slots day after day after day."
Headed to 10 next.
"$9 billion market cap with $2.8 billion revs, more cash than debt... should be $25.00"
"1 million shares traded AHAfter-Hours Volume 1,007,854Is any news expected?"
"very good long term investment, and at this price I think it is a good entry point, what do you guys think?"
"My BUY Order of $7.79 x 40,000 Share did not fill, still open order since 2:30pm. But my prior BUY order got filled $7.87 x 40,000 (time approximately 11:35am)..Today I only got 40,000 shares, unfortunately couldn't get 80,000. Because my 2nd order of 40,000 did not fill at $7.79..Either way I hv 85,000 shares (5,000 on the day of Earnings+ 20,000+ 20,000 following day after earnings at $8.. +40,000 today at $7.80)..Does anyone know if ZNGA has any strong presence in Desktop gambling platforms like SKLZ, DKNG ??Thanks"
"Upcoming year we will have more brand new international revenue from Korea, Japan and all of China.Guaranteed brand new revenue gained will also come from ChartBoost, Farmville 3, Golf Rival and Star Wars Hunter."
Anyone think this will rise back up to 10-11??
Small retail traders Will pull Zynga up like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Patience. It will happen.
anyone know why so many insiders are selling? Are they Auto sell orders?
Slow and steady wins the race
20 dollar next two month
