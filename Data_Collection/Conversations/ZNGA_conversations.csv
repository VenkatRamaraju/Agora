Zynga under 8 is a steal!!
"My BUY Order of $7.79 x 40,000 Share did not fill, still open order since 2:30pm. But my prior BUY order got filled $7.87 x 40,000 (time approximately 11:35am)..Today I only got 40,000 shares, unfortunately couldn't get 80,000. Because my 2nd order of 40,000 did not fill at $7.79..Either way I hv 85,000 shares (5,000 on the day of Earnings+ 20,000+ 20,000 following day after earnings at $8.. +40,000 today at $7.80)..Does anyone know if ZNGA has any strong presence in Desktop gambling platforms like SKLZ, DKNG ??Thanks"
"From Press Statement: San Francisco-based Zynga now expects to generate June-quarter revenue of $430 million, up from its prior target of $400 million. It is modeling bookings of $500 million in the period, up from its earlier view of $460 million. It's now targeting adjusted earnings of $35 million, vs. its prior goal of $32 million.For the full year, Zynga is looking to generate revenue of $1.69 billion, up from its prior view of $1.65 billion. It expects bookings of $1.84 billion, vs. its earlier target of $1.8 billion. It raised its goal for 2020 adjusted earnings to $223 million from $210 million. The revised 2020 forecast does not include any contribution from the Peak acquisition."
This will explote in short time
ZNGA = GLUU in the making...
Hold this stock for over a year now price is still going nowhere $9-12 range.
"Something to consider is as of the end of May, there should not be anymore cash payments to gram games for how well Merge Dragons does. The window was 3 years from closing of deal, which took place in late May 2018. Also starting in Jan 2022, there should be no more cash payments to Small Giants. So profits should be just around the corner. Which should also increase cash flow. I bought more today at 10.55, before the jump in price."
Zynga reiterated by Morgan Stanley. Reiterated Rating Overweight
Insider trading allegations against the ceo. This thing is done. Look for 90% haircut coming in hot.
This has turned into a long term hold for me. The future really does look bright here.
"bounces hard off of support and todayover 120,000 Calls are boughtSomething might be up"
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter raised his 12-month price target on Zynga stock to 11.50 from 9.25. He rates Zynga stock as outperform.
"Oh good, hire 25 more employees for the new studio (another $2,500,000 in expenses)...I guess all 1900 employees are absolutely critical to running the company, and none could be poached from there. Hope they release the new Star Wars games sooner than when Dawn of Titans was under development. (It took *years* to release that game) However, good to see DOT is still being played and supported. Anyway, this a long term hold until early to mid 2022. In the meantime, the MMs/shorts will play with this stock and shake out the weak hands like a dog shaking a rag doll."
I know a lot of us are planning on adding today. So good luck to us!
let us see if any recovery in AH
"Sell now, this stock is about to take a dive."
looking good
Anybody know why this is tanking today after a good earnings report?
"“Looking ahead, the gaming developer anticipates full-year revenue worth $2.73 billion.”"
"“Our multi-year strategy of growing our live services, launching new games and investing in global expansion continues to position Zynga for growth.”"
Perfect acquisition target at this price. What do the rest think?
PINCUS Sold 5.3 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock Days Before Earnings Were Released At Around $10.40! Where Is Th SEC?
"ZNGA was just mentioned on CNBC, that their entire portfolio was to benefit from the current situation. I believe that it was also recommended by Microsoft's CEO as well as they are experiencing a huge increase for their Xbox live subscribers."
buy this dip!
FOLKS if they didn't make a profit during a worldwide pandemic then why now?
Took some of my Znga profits and put them in $MYPS (Play Studios) since they just merged with SPAC. Looking for a minimum of $30% gains over the next year. I think this SPAC is relatively under owned and unknown.
"Zynga reported second-quarter profit of $27.8 million or $0.02 per share, compared to net loss of $150.3 million or $0.16 per share last year.-Total revenues for the quarter grew to $720.0 million from $451.7 million last year."
Bought at $8.30.. will hold for short term and see before adding
20 dollar next two month
They were strong through the last year and all the analysts were bullish for the next 5 years.
seems like overkill
Buy out on earnings date
A winner if you can be patient.

"HATERS... wait till it hits $9.00 , then buy....."
"10% bounce next week,,, look at the chart."
"Picked up 1000 at 7.97. I believe it is way oversold near 52 WK low it is. Earnings beat, still up 65% year over year."
Let’s hope that was the end of consolidation because I added 50% more to my position!
In a sea of red… zynga is my only green lifeboat lol
"$9 billion market cap with $2.8 billion revs, more cash than debt... should be $25.00"
Headed to 10 next.
A high guarantee of $25+ Shorted and ready to blast. Huge cross-play gaming territory additional $1B revenues per year
"Oh no what ever will I do, buy way more of course"
love this green day. Im ready to hold this for at least 12 months. but yeah lovely stock.
"Wish I had not recently taken on my first mortgage. This was a steal at $8. Was shocked at the reaction to a minor decrease in guidance following quarter after quarter after quarter of increased guidance. I think Covid actually hurt this stock. It was growing nice and steadily before the pandemic. Now everyone is so focused on ""less time home to play games, blah blah blah."" People aren't going to stop playing games because they are slightly less restricted. More so, the problem is an oversaturation of the game market. That is my only concern with this company. Neither Gram Games nor Small Giants follow-ups have come anywhere near their hits. I feel a ton of contingency was paid early on that may fizzle out right when the payments are done. That said, as a side note, Harry Potter should be trouncing Candy Crush. For the life of me, I cannot believe that game still sits in the top couple slots day after day after day."
CHINESE CHINESE CHINESE GODLESS COUNTRY Will just take your source code and copy paste into a new company probably by Monday. ZNGA bought vaporware for $600M
Back to $10 soon
Solid
"Huge options activity in a very narrow range. 2/5 @ $11 (34,000 calls) 1/29 @ $10.50 (13,000 calls) 1/22 @ $10.50 (11,000 calls). Somebody's making some big bets on a short term move."
"There were profit takers or people who reduced their holdings to lock in profits. That is quite normal. Those who thought this would just go up without pause are unrealistic. Longer term into the next few quarters, as the deferred revenue is taken, growth will be rewarded. Traders take profits and investors will see the rewards of patience. All the financials look solid and promising."
Strongly believe BUYING ZNGA today will be one of the very best timing plays on this stock.Believe holding for at least 4 months to 1 year will prove to be an excellent investment.Believe by December 2021 ZNGA will be at least $10-$12 per share and Q1 $14 per share.
Is there any chance of short squeeze.

"Zynga’s enhanced portfolio is expected to strengthen its competitive edge. The addition of Peak’s games will increase the company’s “Forever Franchises” to eight. CSR Racing, Words With Friends, Zynga Poker, Empires & Puzzles, FarmVille and Merge Dragons! are some of its most popular games. The Peak takeover is also expected to boost international user base."
"Zynga is a potential take over target, gaming is a very popular and growing trend. I would not be surprised if ZNGA gets bought out in the near future...."

Zynga bought a Chinese company which gives them more access to their massive Chinese market...
Oh god: -16% aftermarket 
"The Guidance Game: ZNGA management only a few days ago improved 4 m on rev and bookings guidance for the year 2020. Odd when you look at missing guidance on the plus side of over 100 m for 2019 and the average qtry guidance misses are about + 20 m going back many periods. So, 2020 could reasonably see 1.7 b rev and close to 2 b bookings (+30% change YoY). With the addition of Peak and new ""promised"" launches for 2H 2020, these numbers should improve more. 2021 could see over 2.5 b in bookings (if Peak delivers 600 m bookings for 2021).All of this indicating possible to hit .50 earnings 2021, w/ 32 multiple...Price Target over $16 is in the cards for ZNGA when discounting. The game maker will be one of the giants and the others have gotten to prices of $50, $100, or higher."
"Wedbush Keeps Their Buy Rating on ZyngaBrian Anderson-May 30, 2018, 3:32 PM EDTSHARE ON: Wedbush Keeps Their Buy Rating on ZyngaWedbush analyst Michael Pachter maintained a Buy rating on Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA) today and set a price target of $6. The company’s shares opened today at $4.20."
"I am a huge Zynga fan. I play both their poker game and their game called “Empires & Puzzles.” Both are excellent. And I recently jumped in as a long investor at $7.01. Finally, I trade with RW Baird, and it raised its target from $8 to $9. So why did I sell today at $7.94? I really hope I am wrong, but I see nothing but brutally, dark economic ￼clouds for several quarters, Study today’s WSJ and turn off CNBC. As for Zynga, as others have mentioned, that payout to the prior owners is a really tough short term nut. But what really caught my eye was the decrease in ad income. I wish all the Longs the very best. But I had to move to cash for at least a quarter, more likely two quarters."

Good time to increase your position!
"To $7 today, really bad news"
"I bought another 2,000 shares at 8. It is a bargain at these levels."
I will consider it below $6 .
"A year ago, znga was at $6.2. If one day trades, this range seems frustrating, but for an investor then a 50% return has been fantastic."
20% down with strong results....
this stock is falling apart
"ZNGA is much much better than GME, fundamentally.. ZNGA $30--$60. Minimum should be 10 times Revenue, that's $30, and $$60+ to trade close to other Online Gaming stocks 30 times Revenue.. ZNGA is cheap is H##L"

We forecast the adjusted earnings to be $0.25 per share, reflecting a mid-single-digit y-o-y growth. Our price estimate of $6 for Zynga is based of a 22x forward price to earnings multiple, and it is at a premium of over 15% to the current market price."""
"So much manipulation on this stock because of hedge funds and insiders, they should get sued"
Looking at $25 here as the target
$2 billion in revs and $10 bill market cap.... undervalued....
"ZNGA Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION). 2016 rev was $740mm tinny and with huge question one truck horse Farmville, Wllst wanted to know if it would survive out of FACEBOOK ONLY FARVILLE.. Today ZNGA is mature well diversified, fat margine, cash flow positive, spread its wings in the most profitable fields of Gaming Online.. Reven of $$3 BILLION is huge, no Brick-and-mortar huge overhead.. Rev of 3 BILLION can easily turn into BILLION PROFIT for online software service buss.. And keep growing.."
"Zynga said that it plans to launch Merge Dragons in China, and it has received some important approvals for doing so.China’s regulators will only permit externally produced games to be launched in China if they go through a certification process and receive an an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) publishing license from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA).Merge Dragons has received that, and it is preparing for launch in China this year. Created by Gram Games, this popular puzzle adventure pioneered the “merge” gameplay mechanic. It will be released on iOS and Android localized in Simplified Mandarin."
"Great volume in a fairly tight price range today with larger than normal lot sizes, and Aug 6 10.50 call options are pretty popular today. Day after earnings with some speaking conferences between now and then. I bought 500 contracts this morning @.20 on this volume/support trade on shares as well as the options interest spike."
Oh baby
"@Flynn...I been in Market since 2001. I been following ZNGA others. Now ZNGA has proven track record, mgmt has strongly proven by well diversified, grown Revenue 300% to $3 BILLION from 740mm in 2016..Now I am in. Credit to the Management, they answered Wllst, YES, ZNGA is grown, and now much much more than Facebook Farmville only.. ZNGA is Online Gaming King, a force with muscle..My humble advice now to mgmt is, #1.. SAVE CASH, pile up CASH to buy out future STRUGGLING bad decision makers.. #2...Grow in Online Gaming Platform into DKNG, SKLZ, sell your own fat margin Merchandise like CRSR.. and ZNGA will be on path to $$50--$100 BILLION Co.."
I have been playing WWF for 2 years. After each move in the game are advertised products. The quality of the company’s advertising has been the best of all companies. For that reason I bought into the stock. Institutions own about 80% of the stock. The risk reward is very positive which will lead to a takeover. The earnings are expected to be positive going forward. The price action on Friday afternoon was very interesting considering that a 3 day weekend was coming.
I like the offering terms for ZNGA.......... they pay .25% per year interest. The conversion price per share is 8.31 per share if the lender elects to get repaid in stock. The notes mature in 5 years but ZNGA can repay sooner (3 years) if they want. I'm not quite clear on the option element but someone (ZNGA) writes a covered call with the lender I think to limit the amount of shares actually issued if the lender chooses to take stock.
"new ZNGA investor, in @ $7.85 - what a gift!"
Who ever thinks this will go down have obviously never been around the market this is a company with solid financial on the way to pure profit with multiple companies under its belt and perfect storm for growth with hedge funds lock in on it
I see zynga writing off a whole lot of what theyve bought in rhe next year or two
"strong earnings, see you at 10$+ Tomorrow"
"I don't know what to think with this one anymore. Insider sales recently, but not a lot of shares. {400} No news and again a another jump pre market. Any thoughts?"
Got my average down to 8.21 43k deep about to make a nice gas station salary on the bounce back
"According to Zynga company alert, this morning Gibeau announces he will present at Goldman. Normally these announces come 20 days out. Considering that recently other top managers have given interviews, my logic tells me these guys are setting things up for a very big win in Q3. Will be comparing tomorrow's interview to the past ones. We'll see signs of growth (hopefully earnings)."
"ZNGA, wants to run-up to $14 now!"
"More positive news:Zynga Launches Word Pop, a Voice Game Based on Words With Friends, Exclusively for Amazon Alexa"
I am absolutely filling the tank with zynga right now I’m surprised I’m not moving the price up tbh
dilutuion in 2026 but almost a 3/4 of A Billion added to the bank always helps to aquire more companies and increase revenues like they have been.....money is cheap right now so its smart of them to take advantage of that.....
High short interest with about five or six days to cover. Each week short interest declines so I see price rising from here. I’m holding this baby.

"I'm sure there will be a record 3rd quarter revenue and great overall news, but they still post a loss with all those performance payouts. The more revenue = the more loss! This is what is so frustrating about this stock and why it's not taking off, but am willing to stick with it when those payout agreements end by end of next year. And of course, the more lockdowns and as the stay-at-home culture continues on = much more revenue for the company."
"I would love this stock to show more umpf and losing faith. However, the technical trader in me sees a couple of things. Long term support shows at 10.20 more or less. And 6 months support shows around 11. The candlestick formation on this shows, if this holds at above 11, we will see a large trend upwards. I see 16. My two cents. I dont care for the bears."

Almost we reached the 52week lowest price. Ridiculous. And the company showed earnings
"Barclay’s“Not so anymore, writes Lu, who predicts that Peak, under Zynga’s guidance, will pry as much as 36% more money out of its 12 million international users in 2021, to match its take in the U.S. One strategy Zynga might deploy is using its data scientists to figure out how to display an appropriate number of ads to the 98% of Peak’s users who are neither paying nor subjected to advertising.Lu’s calculations suggest Zynga could pocket $84 million in ad sales a year through Peak which amounts to $67 million in adjusted profits. Zynga had total sales of $1.32 billion last year.Lu also writes that if Zynga reconfigures Peak to focus on profitability versus user retention—including promoting across Zynga’s mobile gaming empire—the company could add 10% to the division’s bottom line.“"

Watching this company each qtr (well before Gibeau), my takeway is that we will continue to be frustated at $10, then $15, etc... Maybe, somehow, this has helped znga return over 50% stock price appreciation yearly since early 2016."

Best Day of the year to BUY ZNGA!
"ZNGA is a vehicle for institutions to trade monies back and forth - laundering in other words. The Market Makers can see each other and take turns buying and selling the stock in order to pay for services rendered for each other. Example: One Hedgie wants another Hedgie to go short on another stock, they buy ZNGA from the Hedgie that is making a market in ZNGA. The price drop is rarely less than what could be written off as an 'interest rate' on the monies. The Hedgie that received the windfall runs up the intended short, retail piles on and drives the price of the stock up. Hedgie number two sells his shares to retail, Hedgie number one starts to short the intended stock and waits for the price to drop. ZNGA is a convenient way for monies to trade hands between institutions that don't want to get caught paying off people to run up other stocks. The only one that gets burned is You and Me."
"ZNGA huge Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION) vs $740mm 2016.. Well diversified, a force in the industry, proven business model.. Today ZNGA selling for much much cheaper than 2016."

This morning buying and last hour buying was exactly the follow up to Friday. Tomorrow above $11.25 will lead to higher prices. Watch carefully from 10:05 and again from 3:40.Any guess for the high for the week?
Holding 5000 shares.Time to double down. Long term should be good. Company building a solid foundation with acquisitions.
KeyBanc Price Target to $11.00
This is a huge exaggeration of the earnings “miss”. Keep buying the dips. Way more upside than downside. if you agree
Broke $8. Getting cheaper for newbies. Dollar cost averaging and powder is my friend.
This stock has the same pattern every quarter: Run up to earnings > blowout earnings (but a significant loss) > stock crashes the next day > stock settles down and slowly climbs again > run up to earnings to the same price as last quarter > great earnings > and the cycle repeats. This pattern will change starting with Q2 and Q3 results next year (when they can actually claim a profit on the 1/2 billion they take in each quarter) when those performance payouts start to end. (and should be totally done by Jan 2022)
I think I’m about done with this one. Zero movement or momentum. Give me something to believe in here. Anything. Please.

ZYNGA just mentioned on a business show saying $4.50 call buying seeing high volume.
Where do we see this stock in 3 years? One can always dream! I am inclined to say $15?. I wonder what other acquisitions are on the horizon or will they be acquired?
Giaimo also likes social and mobile game publisher Zynga (ZNGA). He rates Zynga stock as buy and raised the firm's price target to 7.50 from 7.
"so let's get this straight - this stock trades at possibly less than 4x revenue, and once it turns a profit of $100 million, its P/E will be 10. To me, this is a $30+ stock by next year. Buy this dip and hold!"

this goes down because of reopening but travel stocks down due to delta varient making people stay home. which is which.???..??..???
"Funny seeing all these first time posters here. In 1 week, they will never post here again."
Motely Fool has this on their buy list..Any thoughts..
All looks good to me. Ready to add more if it dips tomorrow.
The week we’ve all been waiting for. Good luck to all my fellow ZNGA shareholders. This may be the most anticipated earnings report in Zynga’s history.
Can ZNGA survive Apple’s bite? Key to its success!
BARCLAYS ZYNGA PRICE TARGET $12.00
https://discord.gg/pQWyqg4
Sales fell short by 12% that is a big reason for the sell off
This is what happens when founders bleed their shares into the market. He should cancel his stake and move on.
Shorts are going to have to cover soon so expect they are driving the price back for that purpose.
"Rev Guidance for Q2 2019 was 280, came in over $300. For Q3 2019 it is $325. Based on the improvement in games, new launches, interviews....Q3 might hit close to $400 (hopefully over $400). There has to be a lot of progress on Operating Earnings. Funds know this....starting to position. This could get to IPO price early or mid november, my call. Gluu went from $4 to about $12 in 12 months. We are into the 9th month."
"I would not be surprised to see takeover offer before the Aug 5 earning!!! There are multiple large cap players that could benefit by buying out Zynga! If anything it should happen now, before Zynga takes off!! I know takeover has been discussed multiple times before, but who knows, it may happen for real now!! Good luck for the longs!!"
what do you guys think the earnings will be like?
"Likelihood we move past $10.00 soon? I'm starting to get bored of this $5.50 investment, didn't buy enough shares back then. Thinking of gambling elsewhere instead. Opinions greatly appreciated."
Buy order ready tomorrow at $7.9
Conduit Stock Advisory has a strong Buy rating on ZNGA!
I guess the china deal was not in favor? down after market.
AMAZON HAS THE MONEY TO BUY ZYNGA.......
And boom just like that whoever got in at 7.75 just secured a 30% + gain soon

there is still some juice on this stock. it may go all the way to 9.15 by the end of August. but i think i missed 7.90 level.
"great company, and now they are working on cross platforms games, for gaming consoles and PC, this is huge, to the mooooooooon"
Back to $11 soon
owww This hurts  its really cheap now in my opinion but it was cheap at 10 dollar and it still went down. hope this will go up. I bought more.
Zynga will benefit from the growth of Facebook in the coming years
PINCUS Should Buy Back The 5.4 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock He Sold A Few Days Before The Earnings Were Released.
Give it some time of course it hits 10-11 again
"Weekly Big Ugly Dog check and I’d have to say, this Dog is looking like a tiger. Impressive volume could be a good indicator. I’m now second guessing my exit from this one. Time will tell."
"After hours total volume 1,245,190 last trade 8.16To stop future bloodbath,Management should concentrate on making profit not spending cash like drunken sailorsThe only way to help share holders"
Why can’t this stock ever make a BIG move! I’m definitely running out of patience! On paper it seems like a $25 stock but it just can’t any traction.
"ZNGA is now trading cheaper than 2016. Revenue up 300%, value up only 200%.. ZNGA Revenue estimated to be near $3 BILLION vs $741mm 2016.ZNGA Stock $8 today vs $3 2016/2017...Today ZNGA is diversified, stable spread out business, proven business model, Gaming is only spreading like wild fire..Out of all the Gaming, ZNGA IS THE CHEAPEST..And today ZNGA Revenue is huge. Advertising Revenue is growing. From here ZNGA has the Revenue Size mass to Muscle around, increase margin, buy out and grow, grow their footprint and grow organically too..I bought 5000 here"
super mnipulated stock. shorts keep it under 10.50 strike price.
I have both PSFE and ZNGA. Just waiting to see who will cross $9 First.
"5$ by the eod, sell now"
"Well, I am back in. Perhaps too early, but I couldn't take not being in. Sold at $6.31 and back in at $6.20 with about a 10% increase in share count. Covers the short term tax bill at least... I guess. lmao"
"still holding, just waiting for the Q4 earnings. they will make all of this good."
I continue to buy under 10 hope it pans out for me.
"My guess for 4Q, 2021 Guidance: --Gibeau has consistantly been 5% over guidance, so might break $700 4Q.--Guidance will show path to $3b revenue 2021.If control on expenses shows that znga is leveraging fixed costs, this stock price could jump."
Nothing new that revenue growth will slow.. but Zynga's strong merket position stays
Lets pump that thing over 8.50 and the rest will go alone
Winners everywhere today and then there is Zynga.
"Almost a $10B market cap, can someone please share why this stock deserves such a rich valuation? New to this stock and board, thinking of investing."
"I was expecting a profit this quarter, but I do wonder why they moved their earnings date to Thursday. It's always been on Wednesday ever since I started with this stock well over three years ago. Either way, disappointing to see the dive into earnings (which is pretty typical for Zynga). The catalysts for this stock are still amazing. The chartboost acquisition doesn't even close until this quarter (not sure the exact date or if perhaps it has closed by now)... that *is* very significant. The new Star Wars game has the potential to be massive. Just look at what games crush the top grossing charts. Fornite, CoD, PUBG, etc... Battle Royale games. Throw the Star Wars theme on it and it will have a major audience. The future is bright... the near-term is annoying."
Traders....let’s transform znga into another GME amd make one another rich!$$$$$$$
Pinterest and Zynga have the same revs but Pinterest has a $35 billion market cap...
"Well now, this is what you call a True Big Ugly Dog day. You dreamers will keep dreaming as this company drives the bus off the cliff. LOL I’m sure earnings will be fantastic and that’s why insiders are dumping their stock. The absolute Big Ugly Dog Stock of the century."
"congrats longs. Clear sky breakout on daily chart, weekly chart we broke Resistance 1 with #13.68 R2 or it goes blue sky on year! $15 old IPO high in play now, and if that breaks we see $20 this year! Killer day and we broke outside bollingers on both daily and weekly so now lets see if it rides those bands up!"
Reported Strong Q2 Results Ahead of Guidance with Record Quarterly Advertising Revenue and Bookings
"Zynga Inc. recently announced that it is said to have had a great year guided by its strong mobile-games collection and benefited from the rise of mobile-live services backed by its five forever franchises. Similarly,some firms look to be thriving with optimism. (Please check the Disclaimer: https://themarketnewsreport.com/new-method-to-deliver-medical-cannabis-everyone-could-go-crazy-over/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=RTSL)"
$ZNGA Total Debt (mrq) 1.44B
I heard about ZNGA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"$5 coming then $3 lmoa. No dividend nothing to offer sell off in mrket will occur and u can get a stock lik pfizer,amd,apple lmao."
ZNGA acquisition almost certain. Netflix will not let this opportunity go. Load up before its too late.
"ZNGA nearly SAME Revenue as ABNB $3 BILLION.. But ABNB Valuation $100 BILLION almost.. Unbelievable. All the online gaming stocks 16--30 times Revenue, ZNGA is way too cheap anyway you look at it.. ZNGA Cash flow positive, keeps pulling up CASH.."
my luck with investments. first Fastly now ZNGA. UGH!!
"Andrew, It's called short selling and especially after the stock runs up a bit, the short-sellers bid the stock down in an attempt to damper enthusiasm and discourage emotional short term investors like yourself. Try to hang in there Bud, otherwise sell and move on to another happy place.We are not expecting much to change until mid-December as record bookings and revenues are actualized.Remain in good health, Andrew.Peace"
"go zynga go, I have been holding on this one for a looooong while, I hope the time has come to skyrocket, they are now working on cross platforms games (gaming consoles and PC), go zynga go"
"Most earnings in the past three years I've owned, this stock has had the same pattern. Either 1) crash into earnings and then slowly rise afterwards. Or 2) Rise into earnings then crash due to contingency payments. Turns out analysts who cover the stock don't know they exists and thus just blow smoke.A couple of times, there has been a rise into earnings and then a rise afterwards. Maybe we will be fortunate and this will be one of those cases? I am hoping for some form of game announcement... Puzzle Combat and Farmville 3 being fully released... Star Wars game update... something at all like that. Also, expect Harry Potter to be added to their revenue outlook. It's been off to a huge start. Constantly in the top 60-70 for top grossing Android games. This is on par with their top two slots games and higher than Words With Friends and Zynga Poker."
Just got in around $8
"From SeekingAlpha: Zynga upgraded by former BofA bear after record earningsFeb. 11, 2021 8:37 AMZynga Inc. (ZNGA)By: Brandy Betz, SA News EditorSeeing potential in the company's ""evolving mobile strategy,"" BofA upgrades Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) from Underperform to Neutral and raises the price objective from $9.50 to $12.Analyst Ryan Gee says the firm was previously concerned with how Zynga drove growth and margin improvement through ""optimizing UA-spend post-deal and its revenue mix"" rather than the launch of new games.But increasing M&A across the space has BofA ""incrementally less concerned with how ZNGA grows revs/profits; just thatit does.""Gee: ""ZNGA has more resources/experience (headcount, cash,ad tech) than peers and may start to exhibit more platform-like qualities that warrant a premium multiple.""The firm remains on the sidelines on concerns about the competitive landscape."
"Zynga to make Star wars game for Nintendo Switch console, huge move!! Great news!!"
Oh yeah it’s getting back to 10 soon glad a threw an obnoxious amount at 8
I have a $25 PT for ZNGA
"“Total revenue was $720 million for the quarter ended June 30, up from $451.7 million a year earlier. The streets estimate was $679.9 million.”"
"Believe this a terrific buying opportunity ZNGANov/Dec 2021 it really comes together smartlyJanuary 2022 and beyond, ZNGA will be an enormous cash machine!"
No reason for being down 17%
should have known better .Didn't the owner sell millions of shares months ago ?
Patent news…
i've been meaning to sell this for a while since it was doing nothing all year long. thought earnings would've given it a boost
Congratulations to those who held through the volatile consolidation! We broke through major resistance and have nothing but good news coming out. Absolutely loving the way the stock price is performing!
ZNGA would be a good target for an activist investor. Their revenue is growing yet it hardly falls to the bottom line due to excessive stock based compensation. Worth a medium term ride to the 11 area.
Zynga reiterated by Cowen. Reiterated Rating Outperform.
"I am in at $8.15! Way over reaction. And don’t forget, all gaps get filled. They should be back at close to $10 within a month easy, if not sooner!￼"
"This will happen shortly: Real estate investment firm Beacon Capital Partners is in talks to purchase Zynga’s massive headquarters at 650 Townsend St. for around $700 million, according to three sources familiar with those discussions"
"ZNGA is the best gaming software GROWTH COMPANY in the businessZNGA has the largest profit margins in the entire industry, as well as the best CEO and managementNo comparison between the likes of Gluu to the Behemoth of Mobile Gaming ZNGA ... with all their Forever FranchisesGluu is no comparison as they have no future growth nor do they have any new, formidable games in the pipeline"
"Finally looks like Z is no longer being ignored by Wall St. Keep climbing Z..30 days to 4Q earnings. Could pop over $7 after ER and guidance, analyst upgrades."
They're giving zynga the fynga.
Buying under 7 Monday
"Second day in a rowI Million+ shares of ZNGA traded AH.After-Hours Volume 1,252,466"
Need to break through 8.88 resistance level for upward movement.
Znga droped 16% after hours.8.20 -1.57 (-16.07%)After hours: 05:05PM EDT
"Yeah, I gotta get in on this"
"ZNGA 2022 Q3/Q4 price target? We have one guesstimate at $0.61 EPS at ~$20 for 2021. I'm saving up for the new Acura TLX A Spec, which looks like the Type S variant."
"Just went long again, i think we may start to move up and fill the gap.."
"ZNGA will break through $10. On Earnings Call, if guidance indicates over $2B in bookings for 2020 via current product growth, and the wheel of new launches is rolling, the move up will be quick. Aug 5th, 4pm!!!"
"Upcoming year we will have more brand new international revenue from Korea, Japan and all of China.Guaranteed brand new revenue gained will also come from ChartBoost, Farmville 3, Golf Rival and Star Wars Hunter."
"1 million shares traded AHAfter-Hours Volume 1,007,854Is any news expected?"
10b market cap should be 2b
I have had this for a couple years now and I have to say that it moves up very rarely and after what everyone says was a breakout quarter but the price only moves a smidge? A breakout quarter should be rewarded with a much bigger increase in share price than what we just got. Are we hoping for a buyout or just hyping the #%£+ out of it or is there really significant growth on the horizon? I just can’t seem to find anything that makes me overly optimistic on this. In a covid/lockdown year I thought the growth would be a whole lot better than this. Significant growth to me is multi-dollar increases not spare change...
Small retail traders Will pull Zynga up like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Patience. It will happen.

"Thanks for Razorback for posting Farmville 3 and Merge Magic! in the Play store. I knew Puzzle Combat had been in soft launch for a while, but had no idea that Farmville 3 and Merge Magic! were also in soft launch. That makes me feel a lot better. I got back in today."
This is next boom stock mark my word.
"For those concerned about this stock... the future is bright. The best part about the Peak Games deal is no contingency payments. So when Toon Blast grosses 444k in the latest ThinkGaming Top Grossing iPhone Games (US only), that is all profit. Harry Potter is also already consistently grossing over 50k in the US on the iPhone and has only been out a few weeks. As a home grown game, other than the licensing fee, this is pure profit and is already on Game of Thrones Slots level. The game is good. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't turn into a consistent $100k per day game in short order.In another year and a half, the contingency payments start to end. Rollic was added as one, but that was a cheap deal so won't be near the quarterly pain of Gram Games and Small Giant. $12 by the end of the year is still quite possible. Maybe a bit more. Though my earlier suggestions of $15 appear to have been too bullish. Oh well."
"This thing wants to go, but they are supressing it"
buying the dip on a steady stock. =)
"Doubled down on the dip. Mobile gaming will only continue to grow, as will ZNGA."
Bad timing to get into Chinese market.
What did Najarian say. I was on the phone.
Lots of volume the past two days running up to earnings. Lots of buyers so think we will see an earnings pop after hours tomorrow.
Let’s go $NFLX buy $ZNGA already.
"LOL... I am down 148K. No sweat, if it goes to 7.75, i will buy more"
Who is the target audience of Zynga games? Fair open question
"very good long term investment, and at this price I think it is a good entry point, what do you guys think?"
"Zynga call volume above normal and directionally bullish (TheFlyOnTheWall)BY The Fly— 12:25 PM ET 08/27/2020Bullish option flow detected in Zynga ( ZNGA Loading...Loading...) with 17,087 calls trading, 1.2x expected, and implied vol increasing almost 2 points to 39.47%. 8/28 weekly 9 calls and Dec-20 8 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 7,600 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 0.12. Earnings are expected on October 28th."
stock would be $25.00 if the Company would stop diluted.. 1.5 billion float....
Long term future is bright. Seems to me that the stock is under vauled
"Incredible how ""Next Year"" EPS Estimates are climbing for ZNGA. Now the range is as high as .52. Just less than 24 months, estimates were .08 for Full Year. When I look at the earnings since Q2 2016, FG gudance is usually 5% to 10% less of actuals. Adding the possible new launches, improvements in operating leverage, etc.......2021 could see .60 per share, at 32x P/E...znga might hit close to $20 Q3, Q4 2021.Very soon the market will eliminate the gap between today's price and where znga stock price should be at, significantly higher than $10."
Keep it movin
$9 billion market cap with $2.5 in sales and money in the bank...undervalued.
Nice read....https://investorplace.com/2019/05/zynga-stock-turned-mobile-gaming-into-science/
"Don't forget that ZNGA continues to buy companies that are adding to the bottom line. Once they have their stable of companies and especially when they release farmville 3 in the 4th quarter, we go up. They are burning cash to buy companies to be more profitable. They are reinvesting to one day have a much greater revenue stream and positive earnings. I am even on this stock and when it fell back to 8 I bought more. If you are day trading this, good luck. There are far better companies to day trade. I bet I make more money holding this than any day trader who puts in a limit to buy at 7.79 and then it doesn't trigger. Just buy it at market and turn your back for a few years!!"
Cant Wait for Earnings and news of millions of new users!
PINCUS Sold 5.3 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock A Few Days Before Earnings Were Released! Insider Trading Or Just LUCKY. I Think NOT Lucky!
"“Today, we are thrilled to officially welcome the Chartboost team to Zygna, as well as announce an agreement to acquire China-based Starlark - the talented developers behind the hit mobile franchise, Golf Rival.”"
"You have to be in with a long term plan, conversation.. Have dry powder to BUY more. ZNGA fundamentals are very strong, strongest ever, and most stable ever, and now proven business model.."
Wow is nept and m.n.m.d. Cheap... unnoticed cheap like altu a L T U. October twentiesBecause when that hype hitsBuddah
"Just a refresher folks....when the CEO is so so bullish on the growth of this company, we can all expect price appreciation for the next 12-18 months minimum. Longs stay the course!!......https://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2019/02/06/zynga-hits-q4-earnings-targets-as-ceo-says-turnaround-is-complete/amp/"
Zynga buys a company founded by the main developers that shaped the RPG genre with games like Diablo. Acquiring this talent is great news for the company wanting to find crossplatform success......And the stock is down
Netflix should buy ZNGA
lol silly bears
Will it cross $9 today?
Lots of institutional $$$ coming in the past couple of days…
Back to over 10 in the next 30 days.
Not financial advice just my opinion from a quick overview. 1. Institutions own majority of the shares here. Which I can see vanguard and black rock (two hedge funds currently shorting AMC) have a big play in this stock. This raises a red flag  2. Insiders sold off recently in the $10 -$11 range. I ask myself why? Is this stock headed for bankruptcy? Or just back down to the $2-$3 range! Another red flag  3. Go check out the short percentage and how much of the stock is being shorted. Numbers are high which raises another red flag  Like I said this was just a quick overview on my part. More DD is needed but the major flags have me feeling bearish on this. GLTA
"Znga had formed a bull pennant. Target 12 out of the pennant. One of the best traders I ever met was an architect from Seattle when I was gambling in Las Vegas. He told me if there are multi years between all time high peaks, the stock typically doubles within 5-8 months. Look at the all time chart of Zyna back to 2012. You know what the target is for his double theory to kick in. Good luck longs, hope this pans out in the next few years for us."
"JMO - I'm becoming more and more convinced that EA is going to merge or acquire Z. I just find it interesting that Bernard Kim and the COO came from EA. Before Kim joining EA, Bernard served as Director of Sales and Channel Strategy at The Walt Disney Company, where he led sales and retail for Disney Mobile. Griggin, Kim, Gibeau, Bromberg are all EA alumni. The only one on the leadership team that is not is Phillips who is all about mergers and acquisitions and came from Tesla. The board of directors page on Zynga's website no longer works as of this morning. Possible Disney has plans for both, time will tell but others will come to the conclusion that something is up."
Going back to $12 next month
"Shares of Zynga were slammed in Friday trading, after the company said some of the gamers it attracted during the pandemic had stopped playing, and that it has began to cost more to find new ones.Zynga (ticker: ZNGA) share plunged 19% to $7.94 in afternoon trading. That positioned the stock to close with its biggest daily percentage decline since July 26, 2012, when it dropped 38%."
Not sure why my post was removed from Yahoo? All I said was stock has had a nice week and today doing very well. Hoping this pops to 10+ soon and CNBC talked about heavy option action on ZNGA.
Buying more !
Lets get this through the 9 today
I haven’t heard any news on the security breach lawsuit? Would expect to see a bounce on Monday.
Q4 earnings will make everything better !!
"Great, excellent earnings report and future plans, and yet the price is being MANIPULATED. Some weak hands are selling Cheap and Blindly. This will Go Up to teens Not Down. I bought more shares AH last night and will add more today."
On July 29th Pincus Sold 5.4 Million Dollars Of Stock. Isn't That Considered INSIDER Trading On Non Public Information? Where Is The SEC?

Paid bashers everywhere in here ..unbelievable
"CNBC just pumped it, unusual call volume"
Ah finally muted Andrew and the board feels balanced again!
"They’ve got high fixed costs, if the revenue grows a little bit more, they’ll start gaining money. Free cash flow is already positive, just wait, it could be a good investment."
I will keep adding this one if further drops on Monday. No brainer but it will likely go up.
here come thescaryscary crash crash back below $5 after market trade yesterday hit a low of 6.95.theworst is yet to come get what you cAN NOW OR GET ALOTLOTLES THEN $5 SOON RUN RUN TO THE EXIT EXIT DOOOR AS fast as you can beveryvery afraid to lossalotlot moremoney below $5
"Thinking of going in hard on Zynga right now and and holding it for 2 years..any predictions for that time frame? All my research shows upside momentum (fantastic deals, partnerships, 5G connectivity and favorable market trends created by COVID)"
I think results are good. Not sure why this fall :(
"ZNGA is already CASH FLOW POSITIVE, that's real profit, here to stay. Online Gaming businesses has fat margine of profit. At $3 BILLION Revenue, margin of profit is huge guys.. This is cheap here. ZNGA today $8 is much cheaper than 2016.Today ZNGA is proven business model, and a force in the industry, can do and move the industry, can buyout, can muscle others, make big deals.. Its a mature, fat profit margin business selling for cheap cheap.."
Just waiting for BoneAlligator to throw more sardine farts
Don’t see the guidance as bad as market sees it.
Zynga is a huge company with lots of job openings.......
Crushed sales numbers and raised guidance. Read carefully. $616 million revenue versus $560 million expected. $699 million bookings versus $675 million expected. Raised full-year and set great quarterly guidance. Yes they missed earnings but the earnings situation with Zynga is a bit complicated right now...
It will be good to see some consolidation for a few days after such a huge run up....Then ...the journey continues !!! Long and strong
"One thing that stood out in the earnings letter and was greatly expanded on in the conference call was cross-platform play. They did not go into great detail, but what they said is there are new projects that they would like to be cross platform in the future and Natural Motion is taking the lead on that. Including one potentially released at the end of this year (Star Wars, probably?). The games, they say, must seamlessly work between mobile and the other platform. They also mentioned they are mobile first, but if something fits this vision, it's entirely possible they could make an acquisition outside the mobile world. These tidbits are far more exciting to me than anything else in the call. The only disappointing thing was further reluctance to enter into the gambling world. If they ever made Game of Thrones slots real money, I think my father would be broke. haha"
"decent stock, holding small position, will buy more as price drops more..."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Will the Chinese government's recently imposed limitations on gaming adversely impact ZNGA's revenues going forward?
