Advertising Revenue is growing. From here ZNGA has the Revenue Size mass to Muscle around, increase margin, buy out and grow, grow their footprint and grow organically too..I bought 5000 here"
Judgement in the APPL v Epic court case today will ensure ZNGA earnings will explode. upwards we go.
PINCUS Sold 5.3 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock Days Before Earnings Were Released At Around $10.40! Where Is Th SEC?
"ZNGA huge Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION) vs $740mm 2016.. Well diversified, a force in the industry, proven business model.. Today ZNGA selling for much much cheaper than 2016."
10M shares were bought in 10 minutes.
Amazon wants to keep making hit games? Buy znga…
"ZNGA is much much better than GME, fundamentally.. ZNGA $30--$60. Minimum should be 10 times Revenue, that's $30, and $$60+ to trade close to other Online Gaming stocks 30 times Revenue.. ZNGA is cheap is H##L"
This is oversold
I am glad I sold one month ago. Bear
Back to over 10 in the next 30 days.
"Going up up up….”there are some positive developments for Zynga Recently, a federal judge ruled that Apple AAPL +1.7% can’t force developers to use in-app purchases. [1] Gaming developers, such as Zynga, will now be able to offer payment options other than Apple, which takes between 15-30% of gross sales. This should help gaming companies improve their margins going forward.The company also plans to launch FarmVille 3 for mobile, and it will likely result in better growth for Zynga’s revenue going forward, given the popularity of the franchise. The company will also launch its free-to-play Star Wars game, which is expected to bolster its user base and in-game purchases. Zynga also announced a social deception game - ReVamp - for Snapchat."
ZNGA would be a good target for an activist investor. Their revenue is growing yet it hardly falls to the bottom line due to excessive stock based compensation. Worth a medium term ride to the 11 area.
$2 billion in revs and $10 bill market cap.... undervalued....
Short position down around 20% from previous month. Obviously someone is buying
Best opportunity to buy Zynga. This is a no brainer folks! Buy the dip big!
"very good long term investment, and at this price I think it is a good entry point, what do you guys think?"
Loading up ZNGA in the pre-market. Added two more lots long ZNGA at $7.31 ~ let's see how the shorts deal with this very bullish Zynga news.
Zynga has fell every day for 2 months in a row. Miserable stock every since China limited gaming to 5 hours a week.
Loaded 10k shares
"@Flynn...I been in Market since 2001. I been following ZNGA others. Now ZNGA has proven track record, mgmt has strongly proven by well diversified, grown Revenue 300% to $3 BILLION from 740mm in 2016..Now I am in. Credit to the Management, they answered Wllst, YES, ZNGA is grown, and now much much more than Facebook Farmville only.. ZNGA is Online Gaming King, a force with muscle..My humble advice now to mgmt is, #1.. SAVE CASH, pile up CASH to buy out future STRUGGLING bad decision makers.. #2...Grow in Online Gaming Platform into DKNG, SKLZ, sell your own fat margin Merchandise like CRSR.. and ZNGA will be on path to $$50--$100 BILLION Co.."
Insiders manipulating this stock a lot shame them
"DKNG, RBLX, Unity, 40x Revenue.ZNGA Cheap Valuation 3x Revenue, high margin business, growing business. AAPL ruling will improve MARGINE & Revenue on already existing business..AAPL Ruling instantly made ZNGA more valuable, appetizing Good luck to all"
"ZNGA Revenue near $3 BILLION, high margin, AAPL ruling super good news for even better margin, and higher margin Revenue growth, Payment processing...I already hv 80,000 at $8, I hv to save for other stocks for diversified reason"
Reversal coming
catching a falling knife how far will it go. can and will Robin Hood help?
It just has the most random jumps I wonder who does it
Zynga bought a Chinese company which gives them more access to their massive Chinese market...
"ZNGA nearly SAME Revenue as ABNB $3 BILLION.. But ABNB Valuation $100 BILLION almost.. Unbelievable. All the online gaming stocks 16--30 times Revenue, ZNGA is way too cheap anyway you look at it.. ZNGA Cash flow positive, keeps pulling up CASH.."
Shorties better start covering 
"Alright no more negativity. This stock has tremendous potential ahead. $ZNGA Golf rival is huge, Farmville is Huge, Poker is Huge, Starwars Hunters which will be coming to Nintendo Switch consoles will be huge. Starwars is obviously a beloved franchise that grabs a huge audience of players. Battle Royale games do tremendously well. Think of Fortnight with Starwars...live action game. Good money there. Snapchat team up will.bring in a lot. A ton ofnew games on the horizon with StarLark aquisition. This will just keep getting bigger and bigger.. Increased revenue, increased user data base, increased advertising. Sales are always great. This bring this up to where it belongs."
"Goodness, the volume today on ZNGA was a steady, heavy, downside movement all day long. I closed out my covered call and sold my 500 shares for a small profit. I like the business and want to re-enter at some point, but the steady selling all day for ""no reason?"" makes me wonder. I checked insider trading and saw that there were a lot ""sells"" at the $10 level over the past few months. This is not a good sign for a stock that has a lot analyst recommendations for upside. Thoughts anyone?"
"Upcoming year we will have more brand new international revenue from Korea, Japan and all of China.Guaranteed brand new revenue gained will also come from ChartBoost, Farmville 3, Golf Rival and Star Wars Hunter."
"#1..Advertising Revenue UP 109% yoy. #2..AAPL Rulling super positive for Margins profits, additional Revenue. #3..RACISM in Wallstreet must stop. Stop targetting accounts holdings, portfolios just because you don't like them, and used AI, all info to create profiles on them, then target them.. It's deplorable, God doesn't like ugly hearts & minds, Karma sees it all."
"This is still a buy. Ok, analysts reduced the price targets, but current price is a great deal. Buy and hold."
awesome gained 8% of the 11% it lost this week.
My spidey senses say this will start moving soon
"Get ready to buy BIG, since I bought it it is crashing for no reason."
PINCUS Should Buy Back The 5.4 Million Dollars Worth Of Stock He Sold A Few Days Before The Earnings Were Released.
"APPL/EPIC court ruling news, game apps up, APPL and Alphabet down"
Pinterest and Zynga have the same revs but Pinterest has a $35 billion market cap...
This stock is about to hit around $10. Here's a great chance to buy in. Support is at $8.80. Can't get better than that.
"Facebook, Apple, TTWO, Activision, Amazon, GameStop, Twitter,a and even Roblox can buyout Zynga. Beware you will see $13-$20 offering."
Going to $10 great time to load up
"ZYNGA should create legal Online Gambling like Las Vegas, DKNG. Does ZNGA already have something similar but smaller scale ???That would be big profit margin business. I do not recommend anyone gambling, but people will do it anyways. ZNGA might as well provide the platform, or people will spend the money abroad websites.."
I bought the dip but this stock makes me queasy.
Zynga is a huge company with lots of job openings.......
AAPL Ruling all extra margin go to the bottom line..
stock would be $25.00 if the Company would stop diluted.. 1.5 billion float....
CEO needs to win confidence of shareholders and also public to bring more awareness of Zynga. Company PR or Public Relation Dept very poor. Take a pool and ask 10 people if they have heard of this company
"They have a huge opportunity to make big money from in app advertising. The mobile gaming market is set to skyrocket moving forward. But someone needs to take the reigns, and run the company efficiently,"
"Look at the OI of Sept 17 $9Calls...87,676 contracts...Remind me of AMC 40 calls of 40K contract before it jumped from teens to above $45's....Go ZNGA to TEENS!"
ZNGA is holding a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now.
Strongly believe BUYING ZNGA today will be one of the very best timing plays on this stock.Believe holding for at least 4 months to 1 year will prove to be an excellent investment.Believe by December 2021 ZNGA will be at least $10-$12 per share and Q1 $14 per share.
"$$2.80 BILLION Revenue Growing 30%--59%, AAPL RULING to increase margin and profit in lucrative payment business, and overall Revenue too.."
"Zynga is a potential take over target, gaming is a very popular and growing trend. I would not be surprised if ZNGA gets bought out in the near future...."
12 by Q4 earnings
Let’s see if the good news moves the stock higher today.
"Guys, Please do not overload on stocks. Please invest in real business outside of stocks, you will have cash flow, income coming in.. In case Market takes nasty beating you can then keep buying with additional income coming in from outside of Stocks...DIVERSEY, DIVERSIFY, DIVERSIFY."
Adding another chunk in the morning
"I bought another 2,000 shares at 8. It is a bargain at these levels."

Closing in on 52 week low makes no sense about to have one of their best quarters ever. Looks like a great buy.
DOW is down a lot. Lot of panic sellers out there. Lot of tech stocks aren't doing hot.
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
6k shares holding through October it’ll pop on Q4
"ZNGA = MOBILE GAMING, Ad Revenue, increased entertainment 24/7.. As long as you holding your phone, you and 7 BILLION people have access to ZANGA Games in their palm/hands.."
"Hanging tough on a horrible day, maybe we can get to $8 if market swings back this week."
"2021 Revenue $3,000,000,000(BILLION), CASH FLOW POSITIVE. Established Clarity, diversified big force/player in the Online Cloud Gaming. Yet ZNGA is not reflecting Online gaming stock valuation of $40 BILLION RBLX, DKNG, Unity..2012 Rev $1.28 Billion, lots of uncertainty, not sure if there was future beyond one game on Facebook Farmsville, REMEMBER?"
Traders....let’s transform znga into another GME amd make one another rich!$$$$$$$
"Today was a good day (finally). However, I still only give Zynga until the end of next year to be at $20... or at least shooting up in that direction. If the end of their major contingency payments is not the turn-around I expect, then I will take my profits and go to something that actually moves."
Small retail traders Will pull Zynga up like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Patience. It will happen.
"“Our multi-year strategy of growing our live services, launching new games and investing in global expansion continues to position Zynga for growth.”"
Lets get this through the 9 today
"The last time I saw this type of price range on two volatile days, there was a buy out offer."
"ZNGA, wants to run-up to $14 now!"
"Every stock has shorts. Ceo has already said Farmville 3 is completed but waiting till this quarter to release it. Why?? Because even without Covid usage is slower during summer months. People are out more, kids are out, vacations, etc. Most big name companies drop their big games in Q4. If u own an xbox or playstation u know this too well lol. Its when more people are at home, colder months, more play time. This will go back up again. Stay strong. Don't sell. Just losing money off big potential here. We havent seen the effect of chartboost yet and thats expected to add 500 million. Hold out."
"ZNGA benefiting from Ad Revenue like GOOGLE ad, ZNGA also benefits from AAPL ruling of Online Payments allowed to process through game providers, independent of AAPL, GOOG where the whole payment Revenue goes to ZNGA and respective game providers.."
"I love zynga, great future, very promissing company, specially now that they are working on cross platform gaming (games for gaming consoles)"
Headed to 10 next.
Zynga Buyout?
"This software company did not seem to have a good marketing team. Their current logo (dog) is not instantly associated with their company name. If I look at microsoft logo I know microsoft without its name, so is Apple's; Tesla'; Amazon's; etc. They need to revamp their marketing team."
Too much manipulation I see that next two month under 7
"Second day in a rowI Million+ shares of ZNGA traded AH.After-Hours Volume 1,252,466"
"$9 billion market cap with $2.8 billion revs, more cash than debt... should be $25.00"
"I glad I only bought 100 shares, instead of a thousand."
High short interest with about five or six days to cover. Each week short interest declines so I see price rising from here. I’m holding this baby.
65.33 shares are now being shorted. Is this a concern?
Buyout now?
"REMINDER Super Positive facts:Daily users up 86%... Add Revenue up 109%.. Revenue up 59%. AAPL Ruling super positive and will increase margin, increase high margin Revenue. ZNGA is very attractive and GROWING in high margin Revenue of Advertising, and Online Payments with AAPL ruling.. ZNGA is extremely attractive buy."
"Zynga shorts, you overstayed your welcome. Hosta la vista. I have been buying ZNGA stock under $8 the past two days. I also bought $8 calls that expire today. FYI, check out the call positioning. Your other hint: over 375K shares already traded in the pre-market."
Analysis got this stock all wrong. !!! Maybe someday it will rise
"Don't forget that ZNGA continues to buy companies that are adding to the bottom line. Once they have their stable of companies and especially when they release farmville 3 in the 4th quarter, we go up. They are burning cash to buy companies to be more profitable. They are reinvesting to one day have a much greater revenue stream and positive earnings. I am even on this stock and when it fell back to 8 I bought more. If you are day trading this, good luck. There are far better companies to day trade. I bet I make more money holding this than any day trader who puts in a limit to buy at 7.79 and then it doesn't trigger. Just buy it at market and turn your back for a few years!!"
Bought some more @ 8.78
there is still some juice on this stock. it may go all the way to 9.15 by the end of August. but i think i missed 7.90 level.
"DO NOT Buy anymore, MANIPULATION under way. The more you buy, the more they will drag it down, and preventing ZNGA to take part in market going up day.. Thus it's down price continue from last down point, multiplying down pain only. PAIN IS NAME OF THE GAME.. Do not buy anymore"
I bought more and I like it 
How is Toon Blast performing lately? I can't find the revenue rankings like before on Think Gaming.
"Doubled down on the dip. Mobile gaming will only continue to grow, as will ZNGA."
"DKNG, SKLZ trading 16-20 times Revenue, ZNGA CHEAP below 3 times Revenue, has $300 Million Cash Flow.. DKNG, SKLZ burning cash $100+ million..Pl, correct me if I am wrong"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zynga-closes-acquisition-mobile-game-120000081.html
"I was expecting a profit this quarter, but I do wonder why they moved their earnings date to Thursday. It's always been on Wednesday ever since I started with this stock well over three years ago. Either way, disappointing to see the dive into earnings (which is pretty typical for Zynga). The catalysts for this stock are still amazing. The chartboost acquisition doesn't even close until this quarter (not sure the exact date or if perhaps it has closed by now)... that *is* very significant. The new Star Wars game has the potential to be massive. Just look at what games crush the top grossing charts. Fornite, CoD, PUBG, etc... Battle Royale games. Throw the Star Wars theme on it and it will have a major audience. The future is bright... the near-term is annoying."
Wealth Destruction 101:Lesson 1 - Buy ZNGA stock.Lesson 2 - Hold long term.Lesson 3 - Buy more as price drops.
"“Zynga Announces ReVamp, the First Multiplayer Social Deception Game For Snapchat (Graphic: Business Wire)ReVamp is a real-time multiplayer imposter game where players aim to reveal who the vampire player is among their group of friends while they renovate the rooms of an old mansion. In the game, human players must complete renovation tasks, such as demolition and building, to improve their chances of survival while identifying and defeating the vampire during the voting phase. Vampire players must avoid suspicion while picking off human players by completing a list of fake tasks throughout the mansion.""We are excited to continue our partnership with Snap to create fun new snackable games that fit seamlessly with their platform’s highly social mechanics,"" said Bernard Kim, President of Publishing at Zynga. ""ReVamp reimagines the social deception game genre for Snapchat’s human and vampire players of all skill levels.""""Zynga was one of the first developers to launch a title on Snapchat.

ZYNGA TO LAUNCH A GAME FOR SNAPCHAT
Missed the 7.20 the other day wish I added there
I heard about ZNGA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Any predictions regarding the impact of ""Star Wars: Hunters"" in 2022 on the overall stock price next year? Just curious."
"Every stock bouncing UP but my stockS.. This is CRUEL RAC!SM, DISCRIMINATION, TARGETTING..My Wifi gets blocked when actively trading big lots, internet gets disrupted exactly 9:30, and before 4pm.."
This is a huge exaggeration of the earnings “miss”. Keep buying the dips. Way more upside than downside. if you agree
"ZNGA Revenue around $3,000,000,000(BILLION). 2016 rev was $740mm tinny and with huge question one truck horse Farmville, Wllst wanted to know if it would survive out of FACEBOOK ONLY FARVILLE.. Today ZNGA is mature well diversified, fat margine, cash flow positive, spread its wings in the most profitable fields of Gaming Online.. Reven of $$3 BILLION is huge, no Brick-and-mortar huge overhead.. Rev of 3 BILLION can easily turn into BILLION PROFIT for online software service buss.. And keep growing.."
Need to break through 8.88 resistance level for upward movement.
"Zynga has finally put the last nail in their coffin with yesterday's DISASTROUS update to Texas HoldEm Poker. Zynga changes the rules and goalposts weekly, but yesterday they outdid themselves. Blatantly stealing from paying customers and gas lighting people to think this game is fair. Don't take my word for it... Check out the posts on Zynga's FB page. https://www.facebook.com/TexasHoldEm"
What happen here
the problem with this stock now is Chinas crackdown on kids and gaming...
Conduit Stock Advisory has a strong Buy rating on ZNGA!
Probably closing the gap to 9.40 in #WISH. Look at what #ZNGA is doing.
What did Najarian say. I was on the phone.
They had some interesting insights about ZNGA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"still holding, just waiting for the Q4 earnings. they will make all of this good."
"Almost a $10B market cap, can someone please share why this stock deserves such a rich valuation? New to this stock and board, thinking of investing."
Heavily shorted stock. Hedge funds are taking no risks and giving open guidance to short the stock.
Slow and steady wins the race
"Wish I had not recently taken on my first mortgage. This was a steal at $8. Was shocked at the reaction to a minor decrease in guidance following quarter after quarter after quarter of increased guidance. I think Covid actually hurt this stock. It was growing nice and steadily before the pandemic. Now everyone is so focused on ""less time home to play games, blah blah blah."" People aren't going to stop playing games because they are slightly less restricted. More so, the problem is an oversaturation of the game market. That is my only concern with this company. Neither Gram Games nor Small Giants follow-ups have come anywhere near their hits. I feel a ton of contingency was paid early on that may fizzle out right when the payments are done. That said, as a side note, Harry Potter should be trouncing Candy Crush. For the life of me, I cannot believe that game still sits in the top couple slots day after day after day."
"Zynga said that it plans to launch Merge Dragons in China, and it has received some important approvals for doing so.China’s regulators will only permit externally produced games to be launched in China if they go through a certification process and receive an an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) publishing license from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA).Merge Dragons has received that, and it is preparing for launch in China this year. Created by Gram Games, this popular puzzle adventure pioneered the “merge” gameplay mechanic. It will be released on iOS and Android localized in Simplified Mandarin."
I just keep adding spreading out my buys.
"RBLX $70...U $120...DKNG $50 their valuations are $20--$50 BILLION each, but their Revenues are one THIRD of ZNGA or 30% of ZNGA's $3,000,000,000 (BILLION) Revenue..ZNGA is GROWING 59% Revenue, Daily users up 86%, Ad Revenue up 106%. Further Ad revenue boost from AAPL court ruling.ZNGA is super cheap"
"What I fail to understand is where are the shorts, with the heavy short interest there should have been a massive push down already."
Strong buy after the courts ruled apple can’t force all apps to b on there site and pay 30% now they can direct there players to their own site and save 30%
"ZNGA Revenue near $3,000,000,000 (BILLION). DKNG only $1bn Rev, DKNG, RBLX, Unity valuation 500% more expensive than ZNGA, but much less Revenue than ZNGA"
"It's going down because of yesterday's failed update of Texas Hold Em. Half of the people can't even login. Hundreds/ thousands of customers have had chips (that they paid for!) vanish overnight. People are asking for refunds and leaving in droves. It used to be the #1 poker sight in the world. They have been alienating and frustrating customers for months now and today it's coming to a head. Go play the game, see if you enjoy it. I don't know if they will recover from this. I am OUT and #$%$ as hell!"
Someone bought 567k shares @ 8.51 right before market close... Wonder how many more short calls need to be covered? 
Always big volumes at end of day. Someone is accumulating…
Where's the bottom???
On the fence in pulling the trigger on ZNGA...needs some encouragement - thumbs up for yes or thumbs down for no?
"2021 ZNGA Revenue near $3 BILLION vs Remember 2012 Rev $1.28 Billion, lots of uncertainty, not sure if there was future beyond one game on Facebook Farmsville, REMEMBER..?? Well now ZNGA has more than proven itself, in-fact ZNGA is now one of the BIGGEST POWERHOUSES of Online Gaming, Rev nearly $3,000,000,000 (BILLION), that is double, triple over DKNG, RBLX, Unity. ZNGA is the top D0G, if not the biggest D0G of Online Gaming and GROWING.."
Buyout coming soon.
What an absolute collapse this is going back to 6 bucks
"I am not buying anymore. Since I bought at 80 000 at $8, it just never bounced, Market bounced, every stock bounced, not ZNGA, that's sad how I get targeted. That's been my story with Stocks since 2001..I will invest in real business to have it in my control.God bless you all, good luck"
"Zynga reported second-quarter profit of $27.8 million or $0.02 per share, compared to net loss of $150.3 million or $0.16 per share last year.-Total revenues for the quarter grew to $720.0 million from $451.7 million last year."
Oversold…but I can see this company get bought out buy mega cap companies like Amazon or some social media company
Bought at $8.30.. will hold for short term and see before adding
breaking through 9$ go go go
Average PT for this stock is $12. A lot of upside potential.
I do not get todays sell off. Way undervalued. Staying long!
10 this week
"Interesting option trade this morning. 1,440 Put options were sold for the 1/19/24 expiration at 7.00 this morning at 1.53 earning someone over 220,000. Then 5 more were sold at 1.35 earning another 675.00."
"Znga a buy “When turmoil hit the market earlier this month, there was only one stock that I pounced on: mobile gaming leader Zynga. For investors who are interested in gaining exposure to the fast-growing video game industry, now could be a great time to buy the stock -- especially considering that its share price recovery has been weaker than many other leaders in the technology and entertainment industries. With the company trading at roughly 21 times this year's expected earnings and 3 times expected sales, Zynga is a promising growth stock that's sitting in value territory. And the long-term outlook is solid despite its recent share-price slide."
Going back to $12 next month
"ZNGA is best Buy..#1..Undervalued already corrected too much, did not go up to start with, not reflecting it's near $3 BILLION Revenue. #2..GAMES, especially Phone games or ZNGA games are immune to market correction, if not a plus, as more people sink their eyes and heads in phones. #3..GAMES, DKNG, RBLX, Unity, 40x Revenue, ZNGA is 3x Revenue, way undervalued any way you look at it. #4..AAPL ruling is very positive for GAMEs, higher margins on already existing Revenue, and further boost to Growth in the form of additional Revenue from in house payment processing by GAME cos.."
"This sock is going to tank, big time. Not sure if you aware but Zynga did an upgrade of their poker app and screwed the whole thing up. This upgrade has supposedly been going on for two weeks now and the site is a mess. Nothing is working correctly, player are leaving in masses..so there goes revenue. I do not own or short this stock, never have.....I am a player there and communicate with many players and they are exiting.There is no communication from the company. Check my facts if you do not believe. I have no financial interest."
Looking beautiful this morning . Great news announcements with StarLark. Earnings will be released on a Monday which usually means by past predictions and analysts that earnings beat revenue by 3% or more...lets go Zynga!!!!
"My BUY Order of $7.79 x 40,000 Share did not fill, still open order since 2:30pm. But my prior BUY order got filled $7.87 x 40,000 (time approximately 11:35am)..Today I only got 40,000 shares, unfortunately couldn't get 80,000. Because my 2nd order of 40,000 did not fill at $7.79..Either way I hv 85,000 shares (5,000 on the day of Earnings+ 20,000+ 20,000 following day after earnings at $8.. +40,000 today at $7.80)..Does anyone know if ZNGA has any strong presence in Desktop gambling platforms like SKLZ, DKNG ??Thanks"
Pre-registration begins for Farmville 3. Launch date November 4th. Time to go up my friends. :)
$9 billion market cap with $2.5 in sales and money in the bank...undervalued.
PE of 16 for a growth company is ridiculous. Time to buy with both hands.
This stock is going to explode all of a sudden. New game coming soonnnnnnn
This will pop abruptly leaving sad shorters befuddled ;)
"Goodbye All, it’s been long and it was supposed to be fun so, with that I’m taking my shares over to Xlinix and I will get 1 and 3/4’s of AMD for each one after they merge. Approval from China is imminent as their supreme leader has already given it his blessing. You can’t blame them for being cautious with that information. One miscue and your whole lineage is erased! I think we should hear by Friday and if not it won’t be announced until AMD’s earnings call in November! I had Zynga for 3 years and I made paper route money! Good luck!"
Will make the turn soon breakout from the falling wedge ..
Gonna get my average to 8.75 today that’s my goal
https://youtu.be/u-k2q-1v5DYCEO expects a record year regardless. Waiting for right time in Q4 to drop the game
Back to $10 soon
"Matthew Holloway, is predicting a buyout for ZNGA,takeout price $15 per share all cash."
"FO NOOT Buy anymore, they using your buy to give you more pain.. 'PAIN' is name of the game. Stop buying when a stock only goes down but not take part when Market goes up.. That's a sign some fishy trading MANIPULATION..Its injustice targetting, DISCRIMINATION, but it's the reality..I always get targeted, GE 4 yrs, TWOU $11 from $46.. Just kept buying. The more I bought every time they dropped it by 20%.. DISCRIMINATION is real, it's sad reality in the minds of cruel human beings at the top, against UNFORTUNATE people..God is watching, Karma is real"
