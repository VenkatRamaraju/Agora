M&T Bank reached a 52 Week low at 126.08
MTB USE OF TOILET YES THERE IS A CHARGE
"The Fed has technically raised the leverage threshold of the big banks for deposits. Maybe to encourage more loans or to discourage savings. I think this is positive for M & T, or hope so."
MTB IS A NICKEL AND DIME BANK YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR AN ENVELOPE!!!
Somehow word got out that I bought some.
So I have 21 shares of PBCT…that is 2.47 shares of MTB after merger. Will I receive that or will they only give me 2 shares of MTB and cash out the the rest?
MTB charges for envelopes at their bank do they need a few cents more???
"cheap, probably because low dividend"
the fall hurts hopefully the dividend stays .
I took a small loss after buying this recently at $150. Glad to get out at $146 after seeing the drop!

"sell before earnings, look at SBNY"
well now that's some good numbers and beat estimates now let's get moving to and beyond the Target prices over 200
rude inconsiderate personnel at their banks and business is suffering as a result
8 Billion plus for peoples bank today! Leaving 6000 employees in Limbo.
"Southern Michigan Bank (SOMC) is a $700 million bank located in Michigan, with 15 locations. The bank has been around since 1871, observes explains Doug Hughes, editor of Bank Newsletter. They have almost, no bad loans, strong management and a book value of $30.00 a share. Banks like this usually get almost 2 times book in a takeout. They also pay a solid 2.5% cash dividend, and should earn well over $3.00 a share in 2018, so the PE is also very low. In my opinion, this is about as safe a bank stock as you can nd in today’s stock market. I see almost no downside risk and 55% upside, which makes it a top holding. No other group than the small banks still has so many names that are still so cheap. I expect that there will be a wave of small bank mergers in 2018, with many bank stocks having moved up over 50% or more and many not moving at all, this creates miss- pricing so deals will happen fast. SOMC ts this merger pro le with strong earnings, almost no bad loans, and a stock that hasn’t moved up like the larger ones in the group. Fifth Third (ITB) would make a great t for them; I would view that as a win-win for shareholders on both sides of the deal. Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) is an investment rm focused on nancial advisory services and asset management. The company remains under the radar, and I believe the stock is super cheap, explains Doug Hughes, editor of Bank Newsletter. It may soon be a di erent story; with the relative strength building the stock may eventually catch the attention of investors that follow the technical charts. And with a tangible book value of $26 or so, the stock may also catch the attention of fundamental investors. At Oppenheimer, the insiders always buy shares each and every year and never sell any shares. You have got to love that. The company even bought a bunch of its own stock back at low prices that were way under book value, adding to shareholder value. Fair value for the stock in this market is $30.00 to $33.00, well above current price levels. With a takeover deal, however, I would expect they could get $38 a share at the low end and a high-end upside target of $44. This investment bank is relatively small; as a result, I believe a deal is the thing that makes the most sense in this low interest rate world. So, while the stock is certainly trading like a deal could come at any time, it is still cheap. Oppenheimer Holdings also does have options, which is rare with a smaller cap stock. As a result, you can make even more money with less capital. Banknewsletter.comDoug Hughes203-942-5905dhughes33@charter.net"
MTB has been great for day traders.
MTB is down 4.90% to 156.20
"banknewsletter.com is a great site for bank stock investingOppenheimer Holdings (OPY)Wow we nailed this, the biggest move in a decade, in a few weeks up from $16 to $24 up 50%, when most Investment banks are down and almost all banks are down but our picks.Due to a hundred or so emails have received this week, I have deiced to comment on the move.First OPY now makes up over 60% of all funds and while many may think, that is too much, the only way to get rich is to not diversify, you only diversify when you are rich. Even though it has moved up so much over the past weeks, over the past year or two not so much, 10% to 20%, depending on the time frame. Second this market loves winners and hates losers’ pulling them up and up or down and down. So, this one is no different, just super cheap still.Each day, there are many stocks losing 20% or more, and many gaining the same in a day. Crazy to say the least.OPY is under the radar still, other than an article they published on my view of OPY, on the moneyshow.com site a few weeks ago, and my site banknewsletter.com.OPY was highlighted once in Barron’s last week if you read the fine print and once in Investor Business Daily this week, on the new high list, but other than that no one saw this move other than us so far.Next week it may be a different story, with the relative strength building each week fast, it may catch all charts and papers next week.Once it gets over tangible book $26 or so, then maybe it may catch over people’s eyes.Again, fair value in this market with no deal is $30.00 to $33.00, or 50% more upside still, to just be at fair value, in this market many stocks go way over fair value, for example OSTK was at $16 a month ago it went up over $16 a share just this week alone, more than it took 20 years to do it did in 2 days, if that’s not a bubble what is, if it were so cheap at $16 or $30 a share why didn’t management buy a lot more shares, they in fact sold some.At OPY the insiders always buy shares each year and never selling any and even the company bought a bunch back.With no tax reform, they get $38 with a deal. If a tax deal, gets done, then $44 I feel.They are so small a deal is the only thing, that makes sense in this low Interest rate world, someone could buy them, almost for nothing. So, while it certainly is trading move like a deal could come, any day, it is steal cheap and about the only liquid stock we can find to buy every day size in. MCPH, is not liquid, so even at $20.00 in today’s market, we can’t buy a share or make any money on that one now. OPY does have options, which is rare, with a smaller Cap stock like this, hopefully everyone made a lot on both the stock and options, it was a long wait but worth it. So, you can make even more money, with less capital. While the options haven’t worked in the past, they are working now and are still so cheap, to use, again, “short-term only, if a deal happens it is going to be soon. Small option losses are always ok, if you are managing the risk with them and use “short-term” ones only, when needed, they again are so cheap in this market like the S&P weekly puts, the risk reward is so well worth it in today’s world and makes such as easy hedge.If you were buying options on say something like OSTK, you must be dead right to make to make 100%, and you are just gambling. On OPY you could have made and can still make like ten times or twenty your money, if you time the move right and so far, we have. This is how Value investors get rich over time with very few losers. So yes, if you asking, we are still buying more shares, yes up to $25, as it is still cheap and it looks like in the worst case a lot of regulations are being removed, and if they earn $3.00 a share next year then $36 is a fair price for them with no deal, by the end of 2018. If it pulls back to $22 and for any reason, and it is not your biggest holding, do it then. Bottom line it is still worth 50% to 100% more and with only ten percent down side risk, even from here is the best risk reward out there. Banknewsletter.com1-203-942-5905Dhughes33@charter.net"

What were analysts expecting?
"Today, Southern Michigan (SOMC) had a great earnings report book andbook value over $31.00 a share now, and they earned $0.78 a share inthe latest quarter, up almost 25%.Over $83 million in loan growth over the past year, wow, andnon-performing loans down to 0.25% of total loans very low.They also increased their cash dividend a little.Add a ton under $37 and make it a top holding now.This bank has over $200 million in deposits at a few of its locations,very impressive. Look for strong earnings growth to continue forseveral years.A bank of this size and earnings power should have a P/E of 16 andtrade at 1.5 times book or $45 plus a share just on normal valuation.Look for a move to those levels this year, with almost no downsiderisk.We sold a bunch of TCF today, just up to fast for us and almost attakeout value now. What a trade.RCBC has gotten away from us now, hold.We also sold a few shares of OPY today and bought more call options,just a way safer way to play it, with the over – all market actingweak again today. Also, the reward, is way worth the risk, of asmall loss, they are just, so cheap.PYPL we “shorted” again and will cover soon.This bank sector was so strong today, in such a weak market, we justhad to take more profits.Now 52% in cash.!They are only a few names to buy heavy now, with most banks running,that we like, but ones like SOMC and a few other odd ball names thatdon’t trade much, are still out there, keep the bids out there and getthe few cheap names that are left, on big down days.Deals are happening daily!There will be 200 more deals this year, how many will you own?Our sector has such a low downside, if you buy it at the right priceand much higher up-side. The over-all market drops and drops and hasalmost no up-side on most names and still way more downside.All they do is talk about Bitcoin on TV and FANG, yet those peopleusually lose money and are taking way more risk than we would ever!Douglas HughesBanknewsletter.com203-942-5905Hughesdoug8@gmail.com"
