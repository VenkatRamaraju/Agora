Stock has moved up big in the past week. No activity on this board and no news that I can see. Any body out there?
Why are the managers not their desks to assist the customers?????????? Good question
Looking for an entry point. May buy a little around 147.
"Earnings were good, stock is reasonably priced at these levels."
RBC Capital Markets rates MTB 'Outperform' with a price target of $166. Barron's
M&T Bank is up 4.91% to 159.08
Somehow word got out that I bought some.
any news to account for a 25% jump in stock price?
Very nice day. The stock likes to be over $100.
$132-$133 I'm a buyer.
"Took my son to an Orioles game. While walking around the Harbor I spotted M&T bank building and pointed it out to my son. I said, ""That bank has no money in it!"". He said, ""Why not?"" I said ""Because it's an M T Bank, an empty bank, get it?"""
"You got to love this, stock drops 11% and no news at all. The company should say something about the drop even if they don't know any reason for it."
MTB will charge you for one envelope
"Even though rate cuts are likely, buy regional bank stocks like $pnc $key $mtb. They hedge against rate cuts and go through stress test to have sufficient capital and liquidity to withstand situations like this, plus they offer decent dividends."
This bank services my auto loan. Every month the payment coupon arrives a couple days prior to the payment due date. Perhaps by design to generate late payment fees. May be great for profits but horrible for the consumer. I will chose another lender on my next auto purchase.
Wondering if stock price will make it an acquisition target.
Stock still cheap.
"I'm seeing most consumer banks were down today on Biden frontrunner news(?)....so I do see the other big banks and some regionals were down but only 1-5% down. 11% down for MTB is a lot. And this is 2 days after the futures market showed it plunging like that. Coincidental (or a forecast?) but still, 11% with no explanation after relatively good earnings recently..."
giving up all recent gains.
So I have 21 shares of PBCT…that is 2.47 shares of MTB after merger. Will I receive that or will they only give me 2 shares of MTB and cash out the the rest?
"Added 45k to my position, stock should be trading around $210"
"You know they can merge all they want, What I really want to see is their online accounts page stay ONLINE! Down again today Happy St Patrick's Day, maybe a Leprechaun got into the servers? As a cusomer I am BEARISH!"
you may a see a little run up right before the ex dividend date. I actually bought some today. Funny enough it started dropping lol.
"things are getting ugly for banks, zero rates, small businesses going under, high unemployment...we should have gotten the virus under control."
We need a dividend increase
Way off it's 52 week high yielding 4%+ yet keeps falling...looking to add more. Should I wait?
I wish I had some insight as to why the hell MTB is down 7% on no news and a day where the broader market is up 3.5%
"and what's interesting about this drop is the comments further below about the futures drop that wasn't true two days ago....now it's dropping big like Wed, almost like Yahoo knew...."
"M&T should start planning the banking possibilities for the cannabis industry since it already has a foothold in Canada. The US Federal Gov is going to change its cannabis laws and probably is already working on drafts for regulations. M&T could become a frontrunner if they spent more time in DC... just saying, you want to be a big bank make bold moves."
MTB is selling close to book value. That’s always a good starting point if the fundamentals hold up. I think they do.
Bought more
"When will merger with Peoples United take place. Will there be a special, partial dividend paid by Peoples United, since they paid a regular dividend in September."
what's up with this stock price . all good info and crashing . why another financial planning company being utilized . what's wrong with expanding the willmington trust ?makes no sense farming out services by one of the largest banks
Impressive earnings for the current environment it shows the company is well managed
MTB charges for envelopes at their bank do they need a few cents more???
"The Fed has technically raised the leverage threshold of the big banks for deposits. Maybe to encourage more loans or to discourage savings. I think this is positive for M & T, or hope so."
the fall hurts hopefully the dividend stays .
