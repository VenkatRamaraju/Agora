Cowen says AYI lost its top customer to a small competitior the CEO called a termite! He expects a mass exodus. Price target $50. All other analysts are positive. Any thoughts?
"CDC said in its recent release with regard to Operating schools that schools should consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited. Acuity's new lightings may contribute to this soon?"

AYI might be one of the longest lasting covid buys. Think about the opportunity in integrated UV lighting. It could easily become mandatory just as sprinkler systems are today. Every indoor gathering spot using UV during closed times to sanitize exposed areas. This could be years and years of sales
AYI lighting with 222nm UV excimer lamps would be extremely valuable for military fleets and submarines because they need to stay in closed environment for months. These would be necessary items even after Covid-19 epidemic. The PDF below is really worth reading to understand its potential.https://www.dsiac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DSIAC-Webinar-222-nm-UV-Light_20210323-final.pdf

"this is the most ridiculous reaction to an earnings release i have seen in a long time - the results were good. the ceo is doing a tremendous amount right with help from his managers. cash flow was excellent and outlook, is fine - even though some costs are a little high and some shipments may be delayed from component shortages. they will go out the door eventually. this comes from ETFs that are like the tail wagging the dog. and it's the blind leading the blind. this is a tech company now and it deserves a higher multiple. it used to be a lighting company that had some technology components - now it's a tech company that uses its lighting platform to advance the sales of its technology products - it's a great pick vs global warming, vs covid, and for the sort of infrastructure efficiency that we need."

"acuity's new light with Care222 UVC illumination fits with the endorsement from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. To continuously and safely disinfect occupied indoor areas, researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center have been investigating far-UVC light (222 nm wavelength). Far-UVC light cannot penetrate the tear layer of the eye or the outer dead-cell layer of skin and so it cannot reach or damage living cells in the body. More than 99.9% of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets were killed when exposed to a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light that is safe to use around humans."

How terrible are the sell side analysts? Even the aggressive ones had target prices around $140-$150. AYI blew through that yesterday and with good reason. High margins. Strong cash flow. Effective management. Will they up the targets? $180? $200? Germicidal UV lighting revenue expected in the current quarter. New source for growth.
