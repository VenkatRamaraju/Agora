"Certification paves the way for incorporating Ushio's Care222 technology in wide range of Acuity Brands products that will treat pathogens in occupied spacesCYPRESS, CA / ACCESSWIRE / August 11, 2021 / Ushio America, Inc. ('Ushio'; http://www.ushio.com) announced today that its strategic partner Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) ('Acuity Brands') has successfully secured a certification by UL LLC for the combination of Ushio Care222 filtered Far UV-C technology with Acuity Brand's newly developed (patent-pending) UV dosing controls. This is the first germicidal UV (GUV) source in the wavelength range 200-230 nm (i.e., 'far-UVC') to be UL LLC Certified to meet U.S. and Canadian standards for germicidal equipment for use in occupied spaces. When properly installed and administered, the module is in the Exempt risk group for photobiological hazards, as described in the IEC 62471:2006, Photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems."
glad I sold this piece of karap at $273.50 a couple years back....I should have shorted it

Nice chart yesterday on strong volume. Seemed to be gaining momentum throughout the day. Holding through ER next month. Good luck to all!

"acuity's new light with Care222 UVC illumination fits with the endorsement from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. To continuously and safely disinfect occupied indoor areas, researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center have been investigating far-UVC light (222 nm wavelength). Far-UVC light cannot penetrate the tear layer of the eye or the outer dead-cell layer of skin and so it cannot reach or damage living cells in the body. More than 99.9% of seasonal coronaviruses present in airborne droplets were killed when exposed to a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light that is safe to use around humans."
Acuity Brands is down 5.50% to 118.30
Selling China made junk lighting fixtures has turned off consumer buying.
How terrible are the sell side analysts? Even the aggressive ones had target prices around $140-$150. AYI blew through that yesterday and with good reason. High margins. Strong cash flow. Effective management. Will they up the targets? $180? $200? Germicidal UV lighting revenue expected in the current quarter. New source for growth.
Glad I dumped this before earnings.

Sellers took about $300 million in market cap out of the stock yesterday because there may be some destocking by a custard it’s temporarily difficult to get some electronic components. The short term hit might be $5 to $10 million of earnings and sellers put a multiple of 30x to 60x on those amounts. The stock trades at a multiple of about 18x. It makes no sense. Apply the 30x they used on the low end and AYI would be $300. Stock on sale today!

AYI might be one of the longest lasting covid buys. Think about the opportunity in integrated UV lighting. It could easily become mandatory just as sprinkler systems are today. Every indoor gathering spot using UV during closed times to sanitize exposed areas. This could be years and years of sales

Neil Ashe and his accomplishments make me very confident Acuity will soon be at $300 per share.
Please stop losing money and buy a stock like NSPR for a short term profit. Get in and get out.
Some additional detail on the ams Osram acquisition would be helpful but its significant Acuity is now more vertically integrated

"this is the most ridiculous reaction to an earnings release i have seen in a long time - the results were good. the ceo is doing a tremendous amount right with help from his managers. cash flow was excellent and outlook, is fine - even though some costs are a little high and some shipments may be delayed from component shortages. they will go out the door eventually. this comes from ETFs that are like the tail wagging the dog. and it's the blind leading the blind. this is a tech company now and it deserves a higher multiple. it used to be a lighting company that had some technology components - now it's a tech company that uses its lighting platform to advance the sales of its technology products - it's a great pick vs global warming, vs covid, and for the sort of infrastructure efficiency that we need."

Stocks running out of steam IHO
an upgrade to buy from baird on momentum growing and then a downgrade to sell from goldman because the risk-reward doesn't look good. so the goldman guy was a hold for a $40 move up and now things are bad? and the baird guy was a hold and says things are getting better? maybe the company needs to communicate better so we can figure out which one is right. goldman's analysts are notoriously bad and his win rate is well under 50%. the baird guy has a better stock picking record. go figure.
