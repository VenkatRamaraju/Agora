Does anybody know what caused the big drop in MANH today. Looks like a very big seller or several?
They would be worth a lot more if they got out of the business of selling some of the low margin products and stick to software/SAAS.

"Manhattan has lost its competitive advantage by being so late to adopting cloud architecture. Current management (including CEO) must carry the blame. They had options to do so in early 2010 when Red Prairie and JDA were stumbling and other vendors were way behind. Now they have a miniscule $3M in cloud based licenses. I expect steady decline in new license sales, and steady decline in service revenue. Their only life line will be support and future sales to existing customers. My opinion is ""sell"""

"The revenue and profit would skyrocket if they worked more with system integrator partners. They should eliminate AIDC equipment, handing only tier 2 support but bring on more robotics. This will boost profit percentages, and reduce the capital required tied up in AIDC hardware and put them in line with the competitors, most of which have already done so."
