"I’m a small shareholder and trying to understand the nuclear space. I’m thinking about putting more in and trying to understand limitations.This stock lost a lot in the end of 2018, but I don’t remember any disasters or problems then. What happened then that tanked the stock?"
what is this company's moat?
BWX is up 6.64% to 57.98
French navy is building a new nuclear air craft carrier. guess who is going to license the tech for its fuel?!!?!
An idea is salvation by imagination.
"Boom yesterday's gain lost at today's open with small dump of stock all at once. Almost like someone playing games. Reality is this stock is one to get into if you think the government is going to push big time to carbon free electrical generation. It has a ""moat"" around it that no one is going to breach. History with the government that no company in its field can match. Could easily get to $100 by summer and maybe $120 by year end.Selling at PE of 20 now with $5B market cap. Buffett should buy this company."
BWXT was selected by Nuscale to be the fabricator for the modules...I see this as being excellent news for power generation!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fluor-nuscale-power-achieves-u-201100108.html
"finally starting to get a little interest, just taking longer than I thought,might be able to make a run to $70 plus by month end.... Just my opinion,still think $100 by year end is in the cards. Time will tell."

"BWXT's current market price is inflated by at least 42%! It is based on a forward PE of 14, which is more in line with its peers that have similar business models! The company is too dependent on federal military procurements for its revenue. Bottom line sell!"
"BWXT doesn’t have any retail investors. What does this mean? I looked it up, 67% is institutional while 33% is insiders. This is confusing bc I own a few shares."
dividend thank you.

Absolutely no buying interest for this company right now. A very misunderstood company which should be reaping the rewards of the move to ESG oriented investing.
Yes we are mired here around the $60 level but I feel once the ESG investors figure this company out and start buying we will be heading to $100 in short order.
"What can BWXT do to reduce their debt? I suppose paying out a lower dividend is one, and increasing revenue to pay it down is another, but since this is nuclear work the growth will be slower than companies like Tesla. I’m asking partially because Wall St. Simple says the stock price is overvalued."

"Two words: Nuclear microreactors....enough said. At the same time this company dominates its field(ie big time ""moat""...hello Warren!!!) and makes money."

"to compare: PLUG $30 billion market cap, consistent money loser, then there is BWXT with a $5 billion market cap and trailing 12 months pre-tax income of $350 million? Or, we could look at QS, they don't even have a product for sale, may not ever, check out their crazy market cap. Sooner or later the ESG crowd is going to find BWXT, at least I think(hope) so!"
BWXT reached a new All Time High at 69.74
"Some nice upward momentum since falling after earnings, especially since the broader defense industry isn't up a whole lot"
No one here?? why?
won a $141.7 Mln in contract options from Naval Nuclear propulsion Program
"Once the ESG investment community and the investment community that wants to make money become aware of this stock it could move up quickly. A month ago i was posting on the EOSE board when the stock was at $14, I said once the ESG and renewable energy investors find it it would start to move. My prediction of $25 by Christmas might fall short but could hit $30 in first quarter. Looks like EOSE is getting discovered today."
BWX is up 4.91% to 58.07
Think it’s time for me to get in done my research and this looks pretty undervalued and I think this sector could run next with the shift of energy
BWXT is up 5.16% to 48.92
"Compare this company BWXT with a $5 billion market cap and $2 plus billion a year in sales that makes $80 to $90 million a quarter to PLUG that has a $15 billion market cap, has $300 million a year in sales and loses $25 million dollars a quarter. This is why once the ESG crowd figures out what is going on here, they will be piling on. I look for $100 in the next quarter and maybe $150 in next 12 months. All just my opinions."
this tech is awesome. solid business with competent people. joyful stock to hold.uranium contracts r up soon. this co will benefit from new builds as complement to renewable. huge government contract w BBB.
"This is the kind of stock Warren Buffet needs to buy. He likes companies with ""moats"" and he is already into power generation big time. Some one who has ""his ear"", give him a call and say for $100 a share you could probably pick up BWX. Maybe he will give you a finders fee."
BWXT with a shout out here:https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-get-us-nuclear-submarine-technology-china-looms-large-2021-09-15/
sell?
"I am starting to ""own"" this board. Talk about a company with zero interest from the investment community. I guess the word ""nuclear"" scare everyone off even though it really is one of the better ""carbon neutral"" plays out there and has no competition. Eventually word will get out. I see this as possibly reaching $100 in first quarter of 2021. Just my opinions of course."
It's a lonely board here. Could be a 50% gainer in this stock sometime in first quarter 2021 in my opinion.
"Hit a 52 week high today. That said we might not make my previous $70 target by the end of March, but we could be close and more importantly BWXT seems to be getting a little more attention , finally. Sticking with my $100 by year end or before target."
Incompetent corporate managment and BOD. All must be fired. No severance package!
great results

This stock might be the best public company play on a government orchestrated move to a carbon neutral economy. Wind and solar are not going to cut it regardless of what you hear. They need nuclear for base load generating capacity now that all the coal plants are being shut down. Once the ESG oriented investment companies/funds discover this stock it should move up nicely in my opinion. Selling at a reasonable PE of 20 with a real dominant position in its space. The question is why some outfit doesn't buy the company?

"Folks, this is the old Babcock & Wilcox. These are the people who supplied the nuclear material in all those 1950/60s nuclear bombs; built nuclear reactors for US Naval Vessels; US commercial power plants, like 3-mile island. They are a very old company, with a new name, heavily connected to the US Gov.. That's why you see it mainly held by 'Institutional Investors'. There is no way the US Gov is going to let anyone they don't approve of touch this company."
this stock is a hidden gem. this companies current moat means its success is fundamental to the security of the usa over the next 50 years. I hope they didn't use solar wind! I see this stock going up to x3
"WOW! Those May 2 earnings sure surprised me. We expected a miss on revenue, but not 15% on earnings. After four straight misses, see no future in these shares. In fact, it is grossly overpriced on earnings multiple, since it has such a tough time growing earnings and revenue. We're voting with our feet! Good luck if you're staying. You may need it."
Big news for BWXT TODAY!
"Interesting trading day. Market up 250 points. New administration 2 weeks from coming into office with a huge ""carbon neutral"" power generation plan. Wind and solar can't do it. BWXT is going to be popping up on someones radar soon enough both investment funds and maybe ""buyers"". Someone could be poking around already, you never know. Just my opinions."
BWXT reached a new 52 Week Low at $41.50
Over sold
With most uranium stocks popping I'm surprised we haven't seen this go on a bull run yet. Good value stock at $56. This could go to $100 when the U.S starts to implement it's nuclear strategy
Finally starting to move up a little. My earlier $70 target by end of March might be a stretch though.....Sticking with $100 by year end.

great earnings! nothing too special but a Q1 earning of 0.73 cents per share is perfect!
"Now Barron's is following my lead.....https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6f99b4d5-d367-3d26-a398-106aa69a7b08/renewable-energy-stocks.html?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooUnlike a lot of way over priced renewable energy stocks,BWXT sells at a reasonable PE (it's making money!) and it has little to no competition. If any company has a ""moat"" around it this is it. Warren always talks about companies with ""moats"" he ought to buy this one, it fits in with his power investments."
"I think this is the kind of stock people will look back on a year from now and go, ""how did we miss that double""? Just my opinion. This company is dominate in its space and its space should be growing."
they make the fuel for the underwater naval vehicles!!!

"If you think this country is going to move toward carbon free generation on electricity this maybe the most undervalued player in the space. Plus, it has long history of working with the government.It would be very, very hard for a company to duplicate what BWXT offers. On the way to $100 or better by year end. Just my opinion."
We should have more individual investors in this company imo
BWXT reached a new All Time High at 68.38
"every year Revenue goes down, debt goes up, yet the stock price keeps slowly going up. Is this because they have a monopoly on providing the government or am I missing something?"
"Welcome to the lonliest board on Yahoo. This is the play that is undiscovered for carbon free electricity generation. $5B company going way back, no one can duplicate their ties to the government and the nuclear industry. Sells at a very reasonable PE. The ESG crowd should discover this company sooner or later when they do I think it runs to $100 by fall and maybe a double in a year, with very little downside. Just my opinions."

"Missed my $70 by end of March target, new target $80 by end of May. I think BWXT is starting to get noticed. Just my opinion."
i really have no clue why there was such a dip for 2 days... seems like people have lost the ability to filter good news from bad news
"There was a time when I think Warren Buffett would have been all over a company like BWXT. He always professed a liking for companies with ""moats"" and BWXT fits that to a tee. this country seems focused on moving to carbon free electricity generation. It isn't going to happen with windmills and solar panels (my opinion) alone, nuclear is going to have to be part of the equation. I have to admit I am surprised at the recent drop in the price. My personal target/prediction is that this stock could be at or around $100 a share by year end. Just my opinions of course."
"BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) announced today that it has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to lead a $106.6 million microreactor development project."

Wait till people find out that they work with NASA
BWXT appears to suggest upside opportunity. google awesome-STOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.

i just realized that the public only owns 0.3% of the outstanding shares. 99.7% is held by institutions!
"Many are wondering why nobody here. Very simple. The price is not attracting the silly kids, pumping/bashing for pennies. This stock, BWXT, is solidly established. Anything connected with Fusion(General Fusion-pricate), SMR(small modular reactors), with government support is bingo in your retirement folio. I only recommend when huge dips, to buy more if you can. Same for Lightbridge (LTBR). The Future is Hydrogen, and, Fusion. Nothing else after Fusion. Europe and Asia, some in USA and Canada are powering trucks, cars with Hydrogen. Billions are invested in the H2 infrastructures. All those mines digging for lithium/cobalt are very destructive for the environment, few mines will be as sustainable possible but nothing can be as clean as Hydrogen and Fusion. GL"
what reason would this stock have to drop $5 then back up? seems very odd.
BWXT needs to be looking at this breakthrough very very closely: https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5420615-challenging-future-for-oil-plus-recent-world-changing-fusion-energy-breakthrough-point
"The ESG investment crowd needs to get past the word ""nuclear"" and realize if they think we are going to be a country generating all its electrical power, carbon free, then BWXT is going to be a player and it is a ""buy"" at $60. Actually makes money and sells at a low PE ratio and has a business with about as big a ""moat"" around it as you can get. Warren, you hear me?????"
BWXT reached a 52 Week low at 45.36
"Here is the play for PLUG power, which is riding the hydrogen hype boom. PLUG has a $30B market cap. PLUGS last 12 months revenue is about equal to BWXT's last 12 months profit. PLUG using its shares buys BWXT for $100 a share using PLUG shares, suddenly PLUG actually has a real business and makes real money. It would never happen but shows you how crazy the valuations are in anything considered ESG and relating to energy or electricity. However the word nuclear still scares the **** out of people, hence BWXT is still being ignored when it is the only answer(nuclear) if this country is going to carbon free electrcity generation. Just my crazy thoughts."

"@D, @Joe, @NYSE, @Anonymous - big thanks for your contributions here, I’m grateful to be part of such a terrific chat board! In spirit of sharing ideas, two other trades I just started: #ORA (largest developer of geothermal — huge portfolio of US geothermal sites and very likely recipient of Biden climate bill funds; they have a plant in Hawaii that will come back online in Q4), #BWXT (monopoly on nuclear power provisioning within the US Navy and I have a hunch we’ll see Trump announce new $$ for the Navy before November in light of need to patrol international waters in an increasingly volatile world, his fascination w/ Navy ships, and his many recent statements to the effect of “I have done more to rebuild the armed forces than any other President” — but no big announcements yet for the Navy)."

"The reality is this is the kind of company ""screaming"" to be taken private by Warren or some PE group. It is all instiutional ownership, relatively low PE, ""moat"" around their business and if the county is going to make a push for a carbon free electric system they are going to need to add nuclear power to the mix. Wind and solar are not up to the task."
BWXT is up 6.57% to 44.79
"Still targeting $100 sometime in the summer. Limited downside, if any from here in my opinion. Company has a ""moat"" around its business and should be starting to get a little more attention from the ESG crowd(they aren't the ""sharpest tools"" in the shed, if you catch my drift, but they will catch on eventually).Just my opinions."
