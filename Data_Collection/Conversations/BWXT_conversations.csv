With most uranium stocks popping I'm surprised we haven't seen this go on a bull run yet. Good value stock at $56. This could go to $100 when the U.S starts to implement it's nuclear strategy
"The reality is this is the kind of company ""screaming"" to be taken private by Warren or some PE group. It is all instiutional ownership, relatively low PE, ""moat"" around their business and if the county is going to make a push for a carbon free electric system they are going to need to add nuclear power to the mix. Wind and solar are not up to the task."
it is an amazing stock. their moat is huge! nuclear fuel for us navy. uranium safety coated pellets for power gen in snr and existing reactors!?! incredible!! I see this topping 100 one day.
Think it’s time for me to get in done my research and this looks pretty undervalued and I think this sector could run next with the shift of energy
"BWXT doesn’t have any retail investors. What does this mean? I looked it up, 67% is institutional while 33% is insiders. This is confusing bc I own a few shares."
"Looking to add some BWXT for a long term nuclear investment, not a lot of shares, 100 to start. Looking to add Monday prior to earnings and perhaps will add more Tuesday, after the earnings announcement.The Australian nuclear submarine contract should boost BWXT. Also I think the future of electric power generation belongs to small nuclear reactors, like the one being built for the government (in partnership with xenergy). If EVs are the future of the automobile industry, then we're going to need a lot more electric power, wind an solar can be used for peak loads but cannot deliver the amount required within the timeframe required (there's no way to store large amounts of electricity at this time).Good luck to all longs."
they make the fuel for the underwater naval vehicles!!!
great earnings! nothing too special but a Q1 earning of 0.73 cents per share is perfect!
"Compare this company BWXT with a $5 billion market cap and $2 plus billion a year in sales that makes $80 to $90 million a quarter to PLUG that has a $15 billion market cap, has $300 million a year in sales and loses $25 million dollars a quarter. This is why once the ESG crowd figures out what is going on here, they will be piling on. I look for $100 in the next quarter and maybe $150 in next 12 months. All just my opinions."
this stock is a hidden gem. this companies current moat means its success is fundamental to the security of the usa over the next 50 years. I hope they didn't use solar wind! I see this stock going up to x3
"There was a time when I think Warren Buffett would have been all over a company like BWXT. He always professed a liking for companies with ""moats"" and BWXT fits that to a tee. this country seems focused on moving to carbon free electricity generation. It isn't going to happen with windmills and solar panels (my opinion) alone, nuclear is going to have to be part of the equation. I have to admit I am surprised at the recent drop in the price. My personal target/prediction is that this stock could be at or around $100 a share by year end. Just my opinions of course."
"Now Barron's is following my lead.....https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6f99b4d5-d367-3d26-a398-106aa69a7b08/renewable-energy-stocks.html?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooUnlike a lot of way over priced renewable energy stocks,BWXT sells at a reasonable PE (it's making money!) and it has little to no competition. If any company has a ""moat"" around it this is it. Warren always talks about companies with ""moats"" he ought to buy this one, it fits in with his power investments."

Surprised this stock wasn't included in ARK's Space Exploration and Innovation ETF
"I am starting to ""own"" this board. Talk about a company with zero interest from the investment community. I guess the word ""nuclear"" scare everyone off even though it really is one of the better ""carbon neutral"" plays out there and has no competition. Eventually word will get out. I see this as possibly reaching $100 in first quarter of 2021. Just my opinions of course."
"BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT) announced today that it has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to lead a $106.6 million microreactor development project."
i just realized that the public only owns 0.3% of the outstanding shares. 99.7% is held by institutions!
Finally starting to move up a little. My earlier $70 target by end of March might be a stretch though.....Sticking with $100 by year end.
