"So much uncertainty. C19, global retreat into curfews as numbers exceed the worst of last spring, failed back-to-school, and the demise of Black Friday are churning #SPG price action into lower vol, eating at premiums and encouraging longs to cover positions and head to the sidelines...out of retail risk... OR into #AMH and #MPW? ... diversifying REIT positions just might provide some principal protection, with strong analyst support and healthy institutional participation at a more palatable price points."
That earnings call didn't seem to go very well judging from the stock movement. Anyone know if anything was said that should be a concern?

I like the story behind this company. Insider buying by the founder and his daughter around the $28 range. So you can buy in less than what they did. They collected 80 something percent of rents for April and I figure they can also use the security deposits to cushion the blow also for other months. While millions might lose their homes they're not going to become homeless all of a sudden. I see them moving towards renting. Short term results might be ugly but I like the long-term outlook. I'm broke now but will eventually add to my position in my ROTH.

"Help me out here. Can someone explain to me like I’m five. What exactly Black rock did buying all these houses at a time when there’s no job security at all? When tenants are defacing properties, not paying rent, and squatting in any vacant property they can find how will this portfolio be protected from liability? I’ll get the appeal from an income strategy but do they really believe that they can protect all these different homes when so many are now homeless or about to be homeless what is The bull argument for buying a AMH is there something I’m not seeing or is this something you’re not seeing?"
