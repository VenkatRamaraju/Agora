AMH reached a new 52 Week Low at 18.92
"This Mizuho equity analyst likes $AMH:""Then, in the single-family rental side, I like American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH), great balance sheet, portfolio improvement tailwinds. They’ve been picking up occupancy and growing rents every month this year, and so they’re building momentum into the middle of the year where there is the most demand, and I expect that they could even raise guidance this year.""https://www.twst.com/interview/discipline-and-thoughtfulness-important-as-reits-are-late-in-the-cycle"
That earnings call didn't seem to go very well judging from the stock movement. Anyone know if anything was said that should be a concern?

"Jack, you seem to always be the skunk at the garden party when it comes to AMH. Are you legit or just a troll like most that post on this board? I assume if legit, you do not own the stock or you are in so deep you need it to drop so you don't get killed so badly in the end."

"Help me out here. Can someone explain to me like I’m five. What exactly Black rock did buying all these houses at a time when there’s no job security at all? When tenants are defacing properties, not paying rent, and squatting in any vacant property they can find how will this portfolio be protected from liability? I’ll get the appeal from an income strategy but do they really believe that they can protect all these different homes when so many are now homeless or about to be homeless what is The bull argument for buying a AMH is there something I’m not seeing or is this something you’re not seeing?"
AMH-PG reached a 52 Week low at 20.70
I like the story behind this company. Insider buying by the founder and his daughter around the $28 range. So you can buy in less than what they did. They collected 80 something percent of rents for April and I figure they can also use the security deposits to cushion the blow also for other months. While millions might lose their homes they're not going to become homeless all of a sudden. I see them moving towards renting. Short term results might be ugly but I like the long-term outlook. I'm broke now but will eventually add to my position in my ROTH.

"Great! Mexican land only, completely undeveloped, appraised value pie in the sky no doubt, and it says “Mexico has the most stable economy in all of Latin America” ?? Give me a break! Their “economy” besides tourism and some mining, is illegal drug and gun running and the cartels run the politicians, so if you think that’s stable and want to “invest” in raw land, I’ve got me some swamp land in Florida that’s gonna be developed too, what a joke. A great scam for these folks to get YOU to fund their Mexican estates more likely"

"So much uncertainty. C19, global retreat into curfews as numbers exceed the worst of last spring, failed back-to-school, and the demise of Black Friday are churning #SPG price action into lower vol, eating at premiums and encouraging longs to cover positions and head to the sidelines...out of retail risk... OR into #AMH and #MPW? ... diversifying REIT positions just might provide some principal protection, with strong analyst support and healthy institutional participation at a more palatable price points."
