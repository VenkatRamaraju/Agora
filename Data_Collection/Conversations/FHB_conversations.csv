Little drop and they push it up past the highs of the day.
We're printing $18 today!
"Banks are in serious trouble this year. Not of survival, but of losing most of their income and cutting the dividend. It doesn't hurt to pick up some shares at current prices, however I believe we will test our March lows in July. Don't buy based on current dividend."

Good grief even if shorty pushes the shares down there's a big buyer at 17.60s waiting. Th is is all smoke and mirrors. Print 18 and let's call it a day.

IMHO the price per share should be 2.5XBV$21.17 or $53 per share. Just saying.
"For me I don't see FHB joining the S&P Small Cap 400 today as a reason for the stock to be worth more. Extended Fri & Premarket today has it up $1.13 on 400 shares. I seriously dount the gain will hold considering the drop in earnings FHB has seen during Covid-19 pandemic. I like FHB,,,,,,, but CPF looks to be a better buy in my view when compared."
Single-phase-subsidiary. As of_$₱¢¹¹¹. 19971.
"Bought at 17, selling at 28. See ya!"
earnings tomorrow....if it feels right buy on Friday.

"Here we go ppl, big buyer drawing a line in the sand at mid 17.20s."
"Hmmmm.....resistance at $30. The dividend is nice....and the whole new ""tax thang"" in 2018 should make it worthwhile to keep for another year or two."
Almost ready to cash out and have a wonderful day.

"need patience to hold FHB to have it revisit 30 to 32 range.Maybe it will happen in 2020; if not 2021?in the meantime, dividend hike, maybe; and better return than under 1% from a checking account, however, subject to loss, depending on your purchase/sell price. .shareholders won't get rich holding FHB."

Out. Made some money but didn't hit the 18$ target. Oh well.
Don't miss out ppl. Trading day will gone before you know it. I have a few shares that I'll give away over 18. Don't regret missing out.
FHB's recent fall towards $24 is making the stock very enticing. Thoughts?
FHB is up 6.27% to 17.13
It cannot be stopped folks!
Wait for earnings on Oct. 25. I think it will drop another $2. Then buy! It pays a good dividend. That is really the play here.
"Several upgrades coming today. Any minute, hold on."

Added 3000 shares today. Very undervalued!
