I can't sell in this type of uptrend. So lovely. Up 15%.
We're printing $18 today!

"We love the ""Trump jump"" in financials. Dow up over 19K today.....just let it run! News of the 20 cent dividend on 12/9 should calm everyone down too."
"Thanks for the tip, I did some research and found more information about $FHB on http://diamondcbd.com/?s=FHB Day trading trading stocks. ""rht"""
FHB reached an all time low at 16.77
Out. Made some money but didn't hit the 18$ target. Oh well.
They can't bring this down ppl. To 18 and beyond.
Got buyers near 17.50 folks this can't fall!

"Hmmmm.....resistance at $30. The dividend is nice....and the whole new ""tax thang"" in 2018 should make it worthwhile to keep for another year or two."
Wait for earnings on Oct. 25. I think it will drop another $2. Then buy! It pays a good dividend. That is really the play here.
IMHO the price per share should be 2.5XBV$21.17 or $53 per share. Just saying.
Good thing I held out. Up. Up. Up
"This is a fun stock that if you got in early....I bought on opening day.....you will probably make $10/share by 2020. Financial sector has not been ""fun"" for a while....this is a breath of hope, and fresh air!"
"need patience to hold FHB to have it revisit 30 to 32 range.Maybe it will happen in 2020; if not 2021?in the meantime, dividend hike, maybe; and better return than under 1% from a checking account, however, subject to loss, depending on your purchase/sell price. .shareholders won't get rich holding FHB."
Major fraud with this. 765 tocurrent.price.
FHB is up 4.94% to 27.38

"For me I don't see FHB joining the S&P Small Cap 400 today as a reason for the stock to be worth more. Extended Fri & Premarket today has it up $1.13 on 400 shares. I seriously dount the gain will hold considering the drop in earnings FHB has seen during Covid-19 pandemic. I like FHB,,,,,,, but CPF looks to be a better buy in my view when compared."

"Banks are in serious trouble this year. Not of survival, but of losing most of their income and cutting the dividend. It doesn't hurt to pick up some shares at current prices, however I believe we will test our March lows in July. Don't buy based on current dividend."

Good grief even if shorty pushes the shares down there's a big buyer at 17.60s waiting. Th is is all smoke and mirrors. Print 18 and let's call it a day.
