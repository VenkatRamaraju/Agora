Think folks. They narrowed 4Q rev range to post a beat come Jan. Then raise 2022 rev guidance again! This is how is works drive SP over $200. Stay long.
"Hopefully we have turned the corner now, positivity is rising TDOC"
"A beat, nice growth. Down -5%.coins up 10090000000% this year."
"long and strong: TDOC is marketleader and had by far the worst service/product range. Gross margins remain high (67%) which is An indication moat. Absolute long term winner, their chronic desease offering is unmatched..."
"Beating estimates, raising annual revenue estimate and they were lowering the losses again. I think it's a good trend. With Q4 being thr flu season and Corona cases on the rise, I think the Q4 results will be even better. I like the fact that their b2b partners and employees like this company... no wonder with those insane stock based compensations! As I work for a fortune 1000 company I can tell ya it's better to pay high for excellent stuff than saving those costs and having bad employees.The only thing this company needs is a CFO IMO..."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"Revenues up 80%+; costs up more, and it’s not just acquisition costs. Stock based compensation is out of control."
Nice beat and guidance. Green in the morning. buy buy buy
"Short term we have covid winter coming also in USA like in Europe! Long term thats the way to go in the future , we need doctors visit online, no other way!"
This manipulation is amazing how these guys play! At least this time longs are in correct side of trading!Down $7plus to now …Stay long! $200 plus by ..
Just keep adding bc long term all Tdoc leads to profits in your account!
Long time buyer of $TDOC. Average price $170. What's everyone's thoughts on the stock given that they've missed the past 4 earnings in a row. I haven't sold a single share yet. I'm hoping for a great earnings this Wednesday. Hopefully push the stock back up towards $200.
finally first time in so many months do I see they beat the consensus estimate. it even beat my estimate to TDOC by $0.02 . Hope that can give some credits to the stock price tomorrow and the coming Quarter at least.
I'll be starting my position today! '22 will be a good year for TDOC. Look forward to joining the rest of the longs who know what they own.
"$200 soon. Long and strong. If you panic sold, you deserve to lose."
I love listening to Cathy she is the smartest person in finance. And there is Cramer...
"To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
Pretty weird post-market activity going on considering the news...
"Teladoc Health just reported its third-quarter numbers, and here's what they look like: • Total visits on its platform up 37% year over year. • Revenue up 81% year over year to $522 million.$TDOC sure the stock could continue to drop in the depth term however Teledoc looks like a beast in the next 2-10 years massive growth ahead and a market leader!"
"Question for the forum -- With the size, scale, and network effects of big players in this space like $TDOC, will $Doc and $Well be able to compete? Will Canadian provinces opt for a made-in-Canada option? Are there any data privacy or other issues that would require Canadian provinces to use Canadian companies? Inter-operability across platforms sounds great, but can't the big players create walled gardens, and break any inter-operability to get clients to switch to them?"
