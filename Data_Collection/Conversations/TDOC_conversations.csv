Anyone knows when TDOC will start generating profits or at least reducing negative results?
OMG ITS GREEN!!
12% short interest
Ark has bought 8.7 million shares $1.2 BILL it is #2 holding next to Tesla
This is not a long term investment. Back below $100.
It's a big scam by Cathie. Don't touch even with 10ft pole. Bankruptcy is coming !
"The problem with this stock is, that despite high revenue growth, they fail to make profits. It's not like a Saas-company, where higher revenue means higher profit."
cathie wood destroyed this
Everything i buy goes down the next day so i bought teladoc get ready to short
"I added TDOC at 142.94, Z at 93.69 and NEGG at 17.64. Expect TDOC above 200 in few long legs soldiers. Short squeeze will come on TDOC. FLU SEASON has started in some states. Hospitals are partnership with TDOC to meet hue demand in Q3, Q4. Regardless of covid or not, FLU demand is huge"
Ark is selling 
"Today Thursday, September 16, at 9:55 today TDOC rallied from 131 up to 134.50 very quickly, Who has this kind of power?￼"
Everything down today - TDOC has formed a sweet cup & handle sellers be careful.
It’s a buy at these levels!
Notice how $TDOC and $DKNG cant go green. Its because its big in ARKK and Burry has a big short in all of them. The market is rigged.
oh no! 120's ... --> 70's in 3 months!
Why is this stock so much weakness lately? Is there any issue with the premise of providing medical services over the Internet? Is there competition from other players? Is the revenue growth not that great as was thought before? What are pros and cons of investing in this company?
Idk why cathy wood loaded up a lot around $180
Was Monday the beginning of a climb back up the mountain? I sure hope so. Bought all the way down to $122
I see no reason to buy this at all.
"$TDOC $WIMI $SQ for borrowing and selling low, so that I can buy more. And also continuing to stay here, because you mis-it"
"I'm in at 135.60...already down a bit but looking forward to participating in the recovery of this beaten down stock. Also just got into AI, BIDU, DM, and CRLBF, my new five stock portfolio. All down over 50% from all time highs with home run potential. Very confident long term...let's go!"
"This company has not been able to make profits during an ideal situation, a pandemic! That worries me."
Cathy caught buying TDOC n ROKU puts !!
it doesnt move on green market days and dumps on red market days. ok got it.
Yay finally up!!!
"I don’t think it’s overvalued but it’s definitely oversold. This is a good time to buy, not expecting much until later October/November though as the market is mostly @$& right now"
Teladoc shares fall on report of being rated the #1 telehealth company beating the average by 31 points.
"It's not just $TDOC, have people looked at other growth stocks? Almost all of them (the 20x+ sales types) have been crushed. $PINS, $ZM, $ROKU, $FVRR, . . .Down 30% or more. Has to do with:1.) massive overvaluations2.) stay-at-home trades getting re-rated3.) rising 10-year Treasury (which crushes high multiple stocks)4.) inflation rising and sticking5.) gridlock on infrastructure/stimulus (in which this possible tax hikes on the rich)With regard to possible persistent higher inflation, the argument is that growth stocks do worse, because their earnings are far into the future. If inflation is persistent and higher in the future, then the value of those earnings could be a lot less (unless they have pricing power to raise prices). Value stocks, by contrast, have their earnings more in the here and now. Take $BMY trading at a 9 P/E vs $ZM trading at an 80 P/E. $ZM's valuation takes the bigger hit, because it's earnings will be worth much less (it is argued) from future persistent inflation. You also had end-of-quarter ""window dressing"" and ""mark ups"" by fund managers, who want to hide their losses and pretend they held the winners this quarter all along, which led to some late-September selling. In short, LOTS of growth stocks took a hit this quarter. $TDOC is not alone (despite my not liking the company for other reasons - have you seen the scandals/criticisms on its Wikipedia page?)."
"The flu season has started on some states. Hospitals/clinics are partnership with TDOC services. TDOC will correct due to its accumulated earnings since Q1, Q2. Hedge funds game is ending, In pre market I bet 10% pop killing a lot of hedgies to file chapter 11. Truth is fundamentals. Another bull roaring is NEGG, WDC"
Today we will find out if friday move was start of the up trend. Hope for a green close on a red market day
"TDOC has broken through the $142.00 support, I wonder how low it will go."
this isnt funny anymore
"So, I use Teladoc, and they are busier than ever. With the new CV variant running, they are now getting more calls. Not sure how this will effect the price."
Not a long term investment. zero risk Shorting this.
the easiest short in history. very cool. this market is a joke.
ARK is officially oversold. cue the 30 percent move up in 30 days. the market is a joke when people care more about harpooning ARK than they do looking for great companies to invest in.
max daily gain 50 centsmax daily loss 5-10$
Excuse for missing earnings is that tdoc is a growth stock. I call BS on that. Don't go public if you can't meet earnings expectations. CEO needs to go if they miss earnings again.
Anyone here a user of TDOC? Curious how people like it (or don't) from a consumer perspective?
Should I buy at this price?

Dropping hard again to $50.
Lower low. Timberrr!
"Have a small position in TDOC, just 29 shares but I'm down nearly a grand. I have little faith in the company at this point. I know I'm probably making the classic mistake of letting emotion dictate my thinking but I just really hate to lose money and don't very often. I gave up on breaking even but hoped it would get up to $150. I may even abandon that threshold. As Kenny said, ""You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."""
Hopefully earnings on 26th blow up
This will hit $50. Not a long term investment. Everyone should be short.
Buy Quantumscape to recoup your money back. QS is considered the Tesla killer due to fact QS will give all car makers an advantage over Tesla's battery technology. Tesla is this high due to their battery technology but Quantumscape ends that era.
lol this stock is dead. talk to me when its at $200. still down -30% YTD
Staying long! Hold don’t let them take you out!!Or add more if anything
love being in something up 20 cents max or down dollars every single day. truly a blessing

Don't buy stock here just sell some puts and play the market stagflation for the next 10 years
Keep shorting to Cathy. This is heading to bankruptcy court !
pumping this on reddit . its obvious michael burry and the hf who hate cathie have destroyed the stock price. time to squeeze these criminals.
Squeeze them
TDOC has ruined my life. Now I’m going to have to try an use TDOC for psychiatric￼ help
TDOC is a long-term buy. I have been accumulating and will continue to do so on any further weakness.
The ARK has sunk. So much for buying way overvalued mo stocks.
They had some interesting insights about TDOC on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
It certainly helps that Teladoc's customer base already includes more than 40% of Fortune 500 corporations. The company works with more than 50 U.S. health plans. Teladoc is also a key telehealth partner with retail pharmacy giant CVS Health. So the news this morning of CVS Health entering Telehealth is incredible - its using Teladocs platform. Teladocs sales are about to growing even more.. wish Teladoc did a news release to explain to the shareholders of this.. read up on CVS website here and it shows TDOC https://cvshealth.com/our-services/virtual-care-services/telehealth
Great price to buy!
Bought the dip$$$$$
"Remote medical potential has been overblown. Maybe mental health or basic consultation can be done remotely. Ask yourself, diagnosis is the basis of medical services, and it means lab work, blood draw, X-ray/CT/MRI/ultrasound scans, heart reading, etc. These must done ON-site. Until we advanced technologically where we can do remote diagnose. I think the market is very limited to TDOC. How the heckk, the Doctor cure me without all these?"
We got all the time in the world. Buying and holding is free. $TDOC $VENA
it truly never ends
"$AMZN $WIMI $TDOC Why Buy WIMI? Currently, WiMi has 195 holographic related patents and 325 software copyrights. WiMi has also produced nearly 5,000 pieces of high-quality, high-fidelity holographic content. and its entire holographic segment revenue exceeded RMB 700 million in 2020. WiMi Hologram Wins ""2020-2021 Advanced Unit in Science and Technology Innovation"" Award at 18th China Scientist Forum."
low 100's guaranteed ...
It's amazing how many people on here (or bots?) talk like they know more than Cathie Wood. LOL. Ignore all the noise. Cathie is looking 10 years out when she invested in $TDOC. The only time she's ever sold some TDOC is to buy something her team thought was worth adding at that particular time. TDOC is going back to $200 within 52 weeks without ANY DOUBTS!
"here comes a red day because its a ""covid"" stock and merk news. endless laughs at this stock price"
wow there are still bag holders out there? lol
When is the earning report?
"They had Teladoc in the 1960's. It was called a ""phone"" back then."
https://youtu.be/NtyaLO_BrFQ
Timber!!! I remember the good old days of making a quick buck when it hit lows in the 180s and quickly moved back above 200.
"Expect 200 breakout quick. My boss run a machine learning, said to load on TDOC now. Also told us to load on CAT, Z and BVN today. He said TDOC , hedgies game is ending. The more we buy at this level or if pullback, the more explosive become the short squeeze. buy and accumulate"
Seriously though. Was there news? Did ARK sell?
Hold 10year health the future
Straight to $200 let’s go
They had some interesting insights about TDOC on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"It’s reached at pre-covid price range, which is super cheap at this level. I got in here last year I’m negative too. I’d love to add more shares but no cash left in my account so all i can do is a hold. Still bullish on tdoc and livongo. Staying long here"
They had some interesting insights about TDOC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I know TDOC is having its problems but come on man. This is oversold now.
$tdoc will take them out
How does this not move up a huge days for the market?
stairs up elevator down nothing changes ever
$75 by November.
This thing is breaking every support it has. Sub 100 easy.
Orange Capital Invest did a deep analysis on TDOC.
Hard to believe that a stock like Doximity is up almost 4X since recent IPO and during that time TDOC has gone nowhere.
Buy when there is blood in the streets. Although i bought some shares at 138 ! Added more at 133 and still down.....Lol
retail panic weak hands please sell .I am ready to buy the dip .BY NEXT WEEK IT WILL BE BACK TO 142.50
Bought 30 shares at $134.70. Just a small position for now. You never know how low this can still go lol
https://youtu.be/fkz25kGCG8U
Good job today. I just get more bullish by the day here. $TDOC $VENA
"Pardon me, but will this stock be needing telehealth services in the immediate future or will emergency surgery be required?"
I’m starting to think there is something wrong behind closed doors with Tdoc. Why do we hear nothing? Just continues to tank lower week after week
"Im sure ARK has done their due diligence, with a 2 Billion dollar position Im sure their many analysts and accountants looked at the company prior to investing in it , ARK is smarter than any of us !"
The downward trend is over. On to 200.
this stock hit 300 when I was in my 11th month of owning it. I was waiting another month to take profits. fml
6 points up in 1 hour ! That shows the possibility to take off and run ..Who did the buying ?
i hope others can have the vision as i do and most Longs here. Bullish $WIMI $AMZN $TDOC
"Get out of tdoc before ark and cathie wood does. Tdoc has no insight or visibility out a year and whether they will be able to renew with the big hmos. Once the “members” start to decline, tdoc will find itself rightfully as a $20 stock. Maybe $25"
Where is ARK ?
$89 by xmas; $65 by Feb 2022
When does Burrys puts expire
"Going to be a great quarter for TDOC. Book it, Dano...."
$TDOC $DKNG Cathie stocks down more than other growth stocks. Just a coincidence? I think not. Rigged market.
"I added 20 more shares as this price is a steal! Price to 2021 sales is 10! 10!! Livongo alone is worth that and Tela has 50% of Fortune500 companies as customers and they start expanding in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.I think the immense M&A costs we had the last 3 quarters are finally digested and within the next ER we will see growing revenues and lowering losses, which will cause a reverse trend.Feeling sorry for all bag holders, just average down, that's what I do and I do admit that I bought 25 stocks before ER as I new sales will grow and the loss will narrow (which it did but not acc. to market' satisfaction, myself included TBH)."
$DKNG and $TDOC same exact daily charts. Michael Burry is short $ARKK. We now move with ARKK and get beat down because a successful investor likes the company.

All we can hope for at this point is if someone can acquire TDOC and bail us out
Going to be a lot of tax selling!
See Cathie added to position and added to buying momentum. Happy I added before this happenedwhen stock hit 52 week low. Great stock long term. Will see good upside going forward.
Was looking in to buying then found out CEO and executives dumping shares at 150 through SEC Edger filings.
Reverse head and shoulder forming time to turn up?
Wow. TDOC paid about $20 billion to acquire Livongo and now the entire market cap of TDOC plus Livongo is $20 billion?
can always bank on gains being lost in a flash of an eye for this one. almost 2 years of this
"When you see all these tools on here talking about TDOC going bankrupt, it's time to buy. 100 more shares at $135. See ya'll at $200."
The future of medicine will be digital and tele health!
Orange Capital Invest did a deep analysis on TDOC
"Bought this earlier this year after having great success in Livongo. Started averaging down after it pulled back from the $300+ high. Unfortunately got in too early at over 215. Kept reading analyst posts that it is in the ""definite own"" for long term. Finally wore me out and have been selling gradually and taking my lumps and re-investing the money in Novovax. Great move so far. Can always come back if improvement in earnings ever happens. TDOC is no Livongo."
Nightmare will end
There is going to be a market massacre tomorrow
House of pain. The bottom seems no where in sight
Will end red
Classic late day off a cliff
rated #1 telehealth company. 52 week low

"Just gobbles up a few more shares Pac-Man style. 5 year investment for me. Who knows, if we keep dropping like this, we'll be a good buyout Target for $200"
"CEO and CFO sold 120,000 shares yesterday. This may continue to weight on the stock price. Last insider buying was in March, 2020 at $0.84 per share. Board member and execs have only been selling since March , 2020, but they also get shares as compensation. Most stocks in the “digital health” investment area has been declining meaningfully lately, it’s not just CSLT. Look at the charts of $TDOC $AMWL $SHCR $ACCD $GOCO since February. They are not pretty. Also, small caps in general have been week recently."
I bought more shares
ah yes we follow the market after the 70% trim now got it
"Might have to add a few shares this morning. Wonder if this is a start of the september correction, or delta fears..."
I am frustrated that TDOC does not have a professional CEO who understands that you can't miss earnings six quarters in row! You provide guidance and engineer a plan to hit those numbers. Mickey Mouse club running the business.
Might never break $140.
$86.35 is where this closed 3 years ago yesterday. Hard to believe this isn't higher than it is by now?
I could care less about Teldoc but when you see this much negativity on a chat board it's usually a good contrarian sign.
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"

Back to $50.
"Blown away by the number of crybabies in here. Seriously, $TDOC is a 5-10 year hold. We got crybabies in here who are tripping after holding the stock for 6 months. Your fault, quit crying and either man up or get out. LOL. TDOC going to $200 within a year but regardless, I'm in this for another 5 years. I've been in it for 1 1/2 years and My acg is $108.

I now have had a migraine for 2 weeks probably because I’m in Tdoc stock. When I tried to do tele health appt with my doctor today they just ended up calling me. My fears are growing that Tdoc will not be what we want

"Folks, this stock and company are over. You needed to be in as the pandemic broke out and out after the vaccines came out.

I think that everyday the stock market is open it is a great day to sell tdoc. Can anyone explain the YouTube video about teladoc’s strategic vision from a few weeks ago? Huh? Did they all take magic mushrooms before spewing absolute nonsense about nothing for far too long ?
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Come on Cathie ..buy more shares !! Lol
"Keep getting down day by day, seems 110s is coming."
Cathy picked up 200k shares more yesterday. If this goes down some more might be a buy before ER
"The more we buy/accumulate, the more explosive the SHORT SQUEEZE become. One thing shorties/hedgies can not messed up is BALANCE SHEET. TDOC is way below its intrinsic value by now. Correction should come above 250 at least. Another discount stock like Warren Buffett styles to buy: Zillow (Z), NEGG, WDC, INTC, JBLU and INTC"
"Okay , well , If the shares were 10 points higher Id like the stock even more , I completely understand how a lot of investors got pulled into buying and now own the shares much higher , I have been trading since 1998 full time ,in my situation with Tdoc im forced to keep adding on the dips. Im starting to join the frustration club on this one !"
Whats everyones average price?
Staying long! Oversold!Waiting patiently!
"This is a long-term tech healthcare growth play. This stock will very likely make higher highs at some point. The question is when and are you willing ride through the volatility? I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd be willing to bet that ultimately, TDOC will make a higher high at some point. The question is when?"
"$99 next week. If you are short, you essentially have 5% risk. 95% reward."
"Hedge funds have been shorting 9,000 companies each and every day. Really tough for stocks to go up when hedge fund/Market makers can short all day everyday."
Can we get some insight as why this is tanking so hard this week?
Easily my worse investment. Why do so many positive articles keep coming out on this company as it plunges to new lows?
