"It’s reached at pre-covid price range, which is super cheap at this level. I got in here last year I’m negative too. I’d love to add more shares but no cash left in my account so all i can do is a hold. Still bullish on tdoc and livongo. Staying long here"
Teladoc shares fall on report of being rated the #1 telehealth company beating the average by 31 points.
$sklz $wkhs $tdoc $nndm lol Cathie wood massive bag holder
michael burrys new big short is TDOC. his tsla puts expired. no other possible reason for this being red every day
"Hedge funds have been shorting 9,000 companies each and every day. Really tough for stocks to go up when hedge fund/Market makers can short all day everyday."
"Is Zoom offering a telehealth feature? I thought I saw something like that. If so, would that hurt TDOC?"
"Might have to add a few shares this morning. Wonder if this is a start of the september correction, or delta fears..."
"I don’t think it’s overvalued but it’s definitely oversold. This is a good time to buy, not expecting much until later October/November though as the market is mostly @$& right now"
See Cathie added to position and added to buying momentum. Happy I added before this happenedwhen stock hit 52 week low. Great stock long term. Will see good upside going forward.
"I added TDOC at 142.94, Z at 93.69 and NEGG at 17.64. Expect TDOC above 200 in few long legs soldiers. Short squeeze will come on TDOC. FLU SEASON has started in some states. Hospitals are partnership with TDOC to meet hue demand in Q3, Q4. Regardless of covid or not, FLU demand is huge"
"When you see all these tools on here talking about TDOC going bankrupt, it's time to buy. 100 more shares at $135. See ya'll at $200."
"Keep getting down day by day, seems 110s is coming."
"Have a small position in TDOC, just 29 shares but I'm down nearly a grand. I have little faith in the company at this point. I know I'm probably making the classic mistake of letting emotion dictate my thinking but I just really hate to lose money and don't very often. I gave up on breaking even but hoped it would get up to $150. I may even abandon that threshold. As Kenny said, ""You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."""
Great price to buy!
"Wall Street thinks this stocks in undervalued and even those guys are near sighted. Buy and hold. Cry now, Laugh later. Shorts need to cover."
"The flu season has started on some states. Hospitals/clinics are partnership with TDOC services. TDOC will correct due to its accumulated earnings since Q1, Q2. Hedge funds game is ending, In pre market I bet 10% pop killing a lot of hedgies to file chapter 11. Truth is fundamentals. Another bull roaring is NEGG, WDC"
Buy when there is blood in the streets. Although i bought some shares at 138 ! Added more at 133 and still down.....Lol
Anyone knows when TDOC will start generating profits or at least reducing negative results?
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
The future of medicine will be digital and tele health!
Easily my worse investment. Why do so many positive articles keep coming out on this company as it plunges to new lows?
"Finally some green, haven’t seen for a while"
$DKNG and $TDOC same exact daily charts. Michael Burry is short $ARKK. We now move with ARKK and get beat down because a successful investor likes the company.
Anything Woods is involved with is in big trouble - all massively overvalued.
ARK is officially oversold. cue the 30 percent move up in 30 days. the market is a joke when people care more about harpooning ARK than they do looking for great companies to invest in.
it doesnt move on green market days and dumps on red market days. ok got it.
"Going to be a great quarter for TDOC. Book it, Dano...."
max daily gain 50 centsmax daily loss 5-10$
Did any of you catch the guidance release today? Concerning
"Pardon me, but will this stock be needing telehealth services in the immediate future or will emergency surgery be required?"
cathie wood destroyed this
Staying long! Hold don’t let them take you out!!Or add more if anything
TDOC has ruined my life. Now I’m going to have to try an use TDOC for psychiatric￼ help
$86.35 is where this closed 3 years ago yesterday. Hard to believe this isn't higher than it is by now?
Idk why cathy wood loaded up a lot around $180
We need to hear from TDOC’s leadership team. This stock is financially ruining me
When is the earning report?
$TDOC $DKNG Cathie stocks down more than other growth stocks. Just a coincidence? I think not. Rigged market.
"here comes a red day because its a ""covid"" stock and merk news. endless laughs at this stock price"
This is not a long term investment. Back below $100.
"I added 20 more shares as this price is a steal! Price to 2021 sales is 10! 10!! Livongo alone is worth that and Tela has 50% of Fortune500 companies as customers and they start expanding in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.I think the immense M&A costs we had the last 3 quarters are finally digested and within the next ER we will see growing revenues and lowering losses, which will cause a reverse trend.Feeling sorry for all bag holders, just average down, that's what I do and I do admit that I bought 25 stocks before ER as I new sales will grow and the loss will narrow (which it did but not acc. to market' satisfaction, myself included TBH)."
Whats everyones average price?
"Bought this earlier this year after having great success in Livongo. Started averaging down after it pulled back from the $300+ high. Unfortunately got in too early at over 215. Kept reading analyst posts that it is in the ""definite own"" for long term. Finally wore me out and have been selling gradually and taking my lumps and re-investing the money in Novovax. Great move so far. Can always come back if improvement in earnings ever happens. TDOC is no Livongo."
Bankruptcy in 2023 ! Mark my post.
Not a long term investment. zero risk Shorting this.
I bought more shares
300 to 130 and still the same CEO?
It's a big scam by Cathie. Don't touch even with 10ft pole. Bankruptcy is coming !
Oh the sky is falling is it?Not !Just a buying opportunity.
"We all know telemedicine is going to continue to grow. I want to see Teladoc tell a better story for the value provided to customers. Time saved, quantified in dollars etc. not just PMPM info"
They had some interesting insights about TDOC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This should be the base price until there’s news. Thanks to the feud between the shorts and my neighbor Cathie Wood (wink wink) that let me add 500 shares at $130.
pumping this on reddit . its obvious michael burry and the hf who hate cathie have destroyed the stock price. time to squeeze these criminals.
"Every time they publish an article it’s all positive news about Tdoc. But mkt is still punishing this stock.. who knows why?Anyway, too late to sell here !Staying long!"
"This simply explains why TDOC model fails.TDOC Dr: Hi Welcome to TDOC, your remote Medical healtcare. How are you.Patient: Doc, I'm not feeling well. I have chest pain and feel dizzy.TDO Dr: Okay, I need you to do chest scan, and let's get a blood draw.Patient: So you meant, I need to step out of the house and go to a real hospital to do that?"
Dropping hard again to $50.
"Shorting first thing tomorrow morning. zero risk Shorting, will drop to $70 in October. not a long term investment."
And there it goes folks. Your gains gone!
"Get out of tdoc before ark and cathie wood does. Tdoc has no insight or visibility out a year and whether they will be able to renew with the big hmos. Once the “members” start to decline, tdoc will find itself rightfully as a $20 stock. Maybe $25"
Notice how $TDOC and $DKNG cant go green. Its because its big in ARKK and Burry has a big short in all of them. The market is rigged.
Orange Capital Invest did a deep analysis on TDOC.
WE FOR SURE GONNA OPEN RED AND CLOSE GREEN. $TDOC $VENA
Orange Capital Invest did a deep analysis on TDOC
this stock hit 300 when I was in my 11th month of owning it. I was waiting another month to take profits. fml
i hope others can have the vision as i do and most Longs here. Bullish $WIMI $AMZN $TDOC
"This company has not been able to make profits during an ideal situation, a pandemic! That worries me."
Ark has bought 8.7 million shares $1.2 BILL it is #2 holding next to Tesla
Will be volatile but direction is now up.
"Okay , well , If the shares were 10 points higher Id like the stock even more , I completely understand how a lot of investors got pulled into buying and now own the shares much higher , I have been trading since 1998 full time ,in my situation with Tdoc im forced to keep adding on the dips. Im starting to join the frustration club on this one !"
whos ready to up 50 cents then down $1.50 again??!!

Nightmare will end
We must consider that this may never go back up again
I’m starting to think there is something wrong behind closed doors with Tdoc. Why do we hear nothing? Just continues to tank lower week after week
It certainly helps that Teladoc's customer base already includes more than 40% of Fortune 500 corporations. The company works with more than 50 U.S. health plans. Teladoc is also a key telehealth partner with retail pharmacy giant CVS Health. So the news this morning of CVS Health entering Telehealth is incredible - its using Teladocs platform. Teladocs sales are about to growing even more.. wish Teladoc did a news release to explain to the shareholders of this.. read up on CVS website here and it shows TDOC https://cvshealth.com/our-services/virtual-care-services/telehealth
Will end red
wow there are still bag holders out there? lol
"I don't think Catherine Wood knows how to read a stock chart. Either that, or she just buys stocks like a drunken sailor and doesn't care."
Don't buy stock here just sell some puts and play the market stagflation for the next 10 years
Classic late day off a cliff
This thing is breaking every support it has. Sub 100 easy.
Undervalued. The TAM is growing exponentially.
Everything i buy goes down the next day so i bought teladoc get ready to short
tdoc needs to address how they gonna do a hemorrhoid exam to return to $300's
Seriously though. Was there news? Did ARK sell?
Can we get some insight as why this is tanking so hard this week?
rated #1 telehealth company. 52 week low
ceo still not fired?
They had some interesting insights about TDOC on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Hard to believe that a stock like Doximity is up almost 4X since recent IPO and during that time TDOC has gone nowhere.
can always bank on gains being lost in a flash of an eye for this one. almost 2 years of this
up 10 cents up down dollars. 11 months of this horror show
Was Monday the beginning of a climb back up the mountain? I sure hope so. Bought all the way down to $122
6 points up in 1 hour ! That shows the possibility to take off and run ..Who did the buying ?
"So, I use Teladoc, and they are busier than ever. With the new CV variant running, they are now getting more calls. Not sure how this will effect the price."
When does this change!? I went from a 200% gain to negative! Incredibly frustrating holding this

Cathy caught buying TDOC n ROKU puts !!
Today we will find out if friday move was start of the up trend. Hope for a green close on a red market day
im out
Squeeze them
This is definitely one of the best long term investments to have.
Jeez...nearly all of the gain from last year has been wiped out.
"The only thing exponential about tdoc, in the words of sub par cathie woods, is the employee stock options held by the bandits running this company. Boy have these guys and gals gotten rich while having nothing to show for it other than a bleeding income statement. The YouTube video produced by teladoc about the strategic vision of the company is one of the most bizarre possibly magic mushroom influenced mgmt company videos I’ve ever seen."
It is dropping 8+ after market today.
"Folks, this stock and company are over. You needed to be in as the pandemic broke out and out after the vaccines came out. The company makes no money and has tremendous dept for a company in it infancy. Management is a major problem, they are lining their pockets and there are no profits, wake up."
$75 by November.
Hopefully earnings on 26th blow up
"$99 next week. If you are short, you essentially have 5% risk. 95% reward."
I could care less about Teldoc but when you see this much negativity on a chat board it's usually a good contrarian sign.
"They had Teladoc in the 1960's. It was called a ""phone"" back then."
OMG ITS GREEN!!
"time to reentry? decision, decision, yes, no, maybe, not? what!!!!!!!!!!!!&^*"
"Im sure ARK has done their due diligence, with a 2 Billion dollar position Im sure their many analysts and accountants looked at the company prior to investing in it , ARK is smarter than any of us !"
I think that everyday the stock market is open it is a great day to sell tdoc. Can anyone explain the YouTube video about teladoc’s strategic vision from a few weeks ago? Huh? Did they all take magic mushrooms before spewing absolute nonsense about nothing for far too long ?
"First half an hour and already at half daily volume. $TLMD is the juggernaut with more hospitals and doctors then $TDOC. And it’s priced at 1/4 of its spac price. Ready to explode, warrants, options or shares."
$VENA $TDOC $TSM lets have a good day tomorrow folks!
Staying long! Oversold!Waiting patiently!
it truly never ends

"The more we buy/accumulate, the more explosive the SHORT SQUEEZE become. One thing shorties/hedgies can not messed up is BALANCE SHEET. TDOC is way below its intrinsic value by now. Correction should come above 250 at least. Another discount stock like Warren Buffett styles to buy: Zillow (Z), NEGG, WDC, INTC, JBLU and INTC"
"PTON, ZOOM and TDOC is over"
Should I buy at this price?
Going bk ?
"TDOC has broken through the $142.00 support, I wonder how low it will go."
Q3 2021 Earnings results on October 27th
bought livongo for 19$ billion and the market cap is approaching $19 billion. how do you not laugh?
Anyone here a user of TDOC? Curious how people like it (or don't) from a consumer perspective?
Good job today. I just get more bullish by the day here. $TDOC $VENA
Reverse head and shoulder forming time to turn up?
Patience ran out. Going to take the hit and bail. This might be worth something in 5-10 years but I'm not prepared to have dormant money for that long. Good luck to the rest of y'all
"Today Thursday, September 16, at 9:55 today TDOC rallied from 131 up to 134.50 very quickly, Who has this kind of power?￼"
I see no reason to buy this at all.
Keep shorting to Cathy. This is heading to bankruptcy court !
Excuse for missing earnings is that tdoc is a growth stock. I call BS on that. Don't go public if you can't meet earnings expectations. CEO needs to go if they miss earnings again.
$89 by xmas; $65 by Feb 2022
Yay finally up!!!
Put your bets on $100's target this Oct!
oh no! 120's ... --> 70's in 3 months!
"Blown away by the number of crybabies in here. Seriously, $TDOC is a 5-10 year hold. We got crybabies in here who are tripping after holding the stock for 6 months. Your fault, quit crying and either man up or get out. LOL. TDOC going to $200 within a year but regardless, I'm in this for another 5 years. I've been in it for 1 1/2 years and My acg is $108. Watch and learn."
Burry crying on Twitter. Reversal is here boys
Back to $50.
"$WIMI $TDOC $ROKU Investing is fun and exciting, but it can be dangerous if you don't make an effort to study the fundamentals."
Why is this stock so much weakness lately? Is there any issue with the premise of providing medical services over the Internet? Is there competition from other players? Is the revenue growth not that great as was thought before? What are pros and cons of investing in this company?
I heard about TDOC the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
How does this not move up a huge days for the market?
"Just gobbles up a few more shares Pac-Man style. 5 year investment for me. Who knows, if we keep dropping like this, we'll be a good buyout Target for $200"
Back to 170?
retail panic weak hands please sell .I am ready to buy the dip .BY NEXT WEEK IT WILL BE BACK TO 142.50
"The problem with this stock is, that despite high revenue growth, they fail to make profits. It's not like a Saas-company, where higher revenue means higher profit."
Lower low. Timberrr!
Zacks strong sell
"I'm in at 135.60...already down a bit but looking forward to participating in the recovery of this beaten down stock. Also just got into AI, BIDU, DM, and CRLBF, my new five stock portfolio. All down over 50% from all time highs with home run potential. Very confident long term...let's go!"
"This is a long-term tech healthcare growth play. This stock will very likely make higher highs at some point. The question is when and are you willing ride through the volatility? I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd be willing to bet that ultimately, TDOC will make a higher high at some point. The question is when?"
Wow. TDOC paid about $20 billion to acquire Livongo and now the entire market cap of TDOC plus Livongo is $20 billion?
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Futures sharply dropped. You can lock in another 4%+ drop tomorrow. THANKS FOR NOTHING
All we can hope for at this point is if someone can acquire TDOC and bail us out
"Remote medical potential has been overblown. Maybe mental health or basic consultation can be done remotely. Ask yourself, diagnosis is the basis of medical services, and it means lab work, blood draw, X-ray/CT/MRI/ultrasound scans, heart reading, etc. These must done ON-site. Until we advanced technologically where we can do remote diagnose. I think the market is very limited to TDOC. How the heckk, the Doctor cure me without all these?"
Going to be a lot of tax selling!
The downward trend is over. On to 200.
Might never break $140.
Cathy picked up 200k shares more yesterday. If this goes down some more might be a buy before ER
Too good to be true. The old fade
"$TDOC $WIMI $SQ for borrowing and selling low, so that I can buy more. And also continuing to stay here, because you mis-it"
"It's not just $TDOC, have people looked at other growth stocks? Almost all of them (the 20x+ sales types) have been crushed. $PINS, $ZM, $ROKU, $FVRR, . . .Down 30% or more. Has to do with:1.) massive overvaluations2.) stay-at-home trades getting re-rated3.) rising 10-year Treasury (which crushes high multiple stocks)4.) inflation rising and sticking5.) gridlock on infrastructure/stimulus (in which this possible tax hikes on the rich)With regard to possible persistent higher inflation, the argument is that growth stocks do worse, because their earnings are far into the future. If inflation is persistent and higher in the future, then the value of those earnings could be a lot less (unless they have pricing power to raise prices). Value stocks, by contrast, have their earnings more in the here and now. Take $BMY trading at a 9 P/E vs $ZM trading at an 80 P/E. $ZM's valuation takes the bigger hit, because it's earnings will be worth much less (it is argued) from future persistent inflation. You also had end-of-quarter ""window dressing"" and ""mark ups"" by fund managers, who want to hide their losses and pretend they held the winners this quarter all along, which led to some late-September selling. In short, LOTS of growth stocks took a hit this quarter. $TDOC is not alone (despite my not liking the company for other reasons - have you seen the scandals/criticisms on its Wikipedia page?)."
Come on Cathie ..buy more shares !! Lol
Bankruptcy in 2023 !
