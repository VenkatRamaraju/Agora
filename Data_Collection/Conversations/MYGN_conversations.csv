What’s the run today?
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
MYGN is looking poised for another 10% leg up! Thumbs up if you agree!

Morgan Stanley upgraded with $55 PT.
Myriad Genetic testing is down 40% this morning and it usually makes money. EXAS has never made money and its only product is obsolete.
"GOOD earnings, PLUS very good future estimates. Up 4+%."
Earnings tomorrow. Anyone with any thoughts?
"Buying MYGN , is like buying EXAS for $12.40, which is in the same screening business. MYGN does not have the risk of Cologuard guard and Covid testing, both over priced tests, going obsolete."
MYGN with a $2 B mkt cap has $835M revenue. EXAS has a $12 B mkt cap with $735M in revenue.That would value MYGN at $ 125.00 a share or EXAS at $ 13.30 a share.
Times are tough right now internally for Myriad (1) Hiring freeze for 90 days (2) leadership team across the board takes 30% reduction in salaries until further notice. (3)Bonuses / commission for ALL employees that qualify will take a 50% reduction in the 4th Qtr!
"anyone else following this stock besides me? big announcement today, looks like a great addition to an already strong product line. your thoughts?"
No news on selloff? Maybe a brokerage downgrade? I can't find anything (yet).
Myriad announced today that UnitedHealthcare has issued a positive coverage decision for pharmacogenetic testing for multi-gene panels including the company’s GeneSight Psychotropic test. The coverage is for patients that have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or anxiety and have failed at least one prior medication to treat their condition. The positive coverage decision is referenced in the UnitedHealthcare August 2019 Network Bulletin.
"Am I understanding the situation correctly? After having perused the cc transcript, it's clear that they have known for months that existing revenue and income guidance would be wildly off. If true, why wasn't a warning issued in a more timely way?? It certainly seems to raise questions about management's ability to stay on top of, and/or communicate, the need for adjustments caused by reduced revenue accrual rates."
"Myriad just had a major layoff, new Prez is making this company lean and hopefully aggressive with more competent sakes people. I was there for 8 years and all I saw was a bunch of pharma reps that couldn’t think on their own if their life depended on it! Myriad is getting primed for a sale!"
Bill Alpert's article on Barrons makes me suspect the timing. It was released 7:26 pm on Friday night. Was it's release held until then to prevent price crash?
Myriad Genetics is down 5.36% to 30.74
MYGN is down -5.89% to 31.18
"After working at Myriad for 9 years, reached out internally to find out what happen, it all came down to leadership under estimating revenue gap. It is time for a board change and definitely a CEO, COO change"
MYGN reached a new 52 Week High at 39.10
"I think I may have a good chance to buy it at $19.50. It may go lower, but I want to take a risk at this price and I plan to average down if it continues falling. It's a good gambling for me."
Is 30% drop warranted after 10% drop in revenue and 20% miss on ER. WHo knows we will see tomorrow!Not worth shorting at this point!!!Roll the dice please!GLTA in stock casino!
"$22 looks like long term support to me so got an initial position just above that price. If it sinks in am, will add more."
"This company has state of the art, effective tests for serious medical conditions. No one care. Stock tanks. Incredible."
Earnings and guidance were great!! An outstanding buy right now!!
Note to shorts: up 3% more today. Lol
so happy I sold. time to rinse and repeat. made so much on this volatility
Not sure if Goldman realizes MYGN is now the only FDA approved for BRAC. See you later fly by night labs. You need Myriad’s data base to make accurate decisions. Who wants efficacy rates of 40-60%. This is a live and death decision. Who doesn’t like 99% accuracy!
"Most of the breakthroughs in medicine of the future will be because of genetics. MYGN at under $2B mkt cap is a gift with its multitude of products. Compare that to EXAS with only one inaccurate expensive product, testing stools, yet the stock has a mkt cap of over $10B."
"After working for Myriad for 8 years, it continues to boggle my brain why the stock is not performing better. The two markets that are performing very well were acquired not organically grown. The Hereditary space has been impacted by companies with weaker data but it amazes me that they are still reimbursed by the same payers. Not a great trend! Ever since Myriad lost their Supreme Court case, Wall Street seems to have less faith in management based on the current stock price. Indication that maybe a leadership change is needed."
buy the dip
And there it is: Prolaris Test Accurately Predicts Risk of Metastasis in Men Diagnosed with Localized Prostate Cancerhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/prolaris-test-accurately-predicts-risk-112857407.html
"FYI: they gave the new CEO 1.3MM shares as part of his hiring package. must be nice. at $13.38 (702,888) and $12.33 (597,908)."
been short since 42 ... gave up just went long @ 46.99
This will close at $33-$34.
Cup and handle breakout emanate!
What is going on? Some good news?.....
Anyone with any news or info on volume and price action? I’m thinking leaked news on fda resolution on genetics testing?
3 day rule.. I am a buyer at 17.50 if it hits that number before 3 days. If not I will buy on Thursday. I dodged a pretty big bullet today. I had 2k at 25 and sold at 34. Whew!
