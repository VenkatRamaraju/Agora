Listening to the call. Management sound incompetent.We don't know how to bill for the services we provide so we don't get paid! ....thus we are going to lower our forecasts to reflect the fact that we are clueless. I think they said the same thing in last quarters call. Hope new Management if found soon.
"American capitalism in the 21st century! Long-term horizon is 3-6 months where 2 generations ago, it was 3-6 years. Our current system is way too hyper-focused on short-term events. Having said that, this company has been treading water for the past couple of years. Yes, it's made some strategic acquisitions but it's no longer a growth stock and now subject to wild swings, usually to the downside when the CEO doesn't deliver the quarterly goods...."
What is point of UnitedHealth deal if 2020 revenue is revised downwards? Please explain.
MYGN reached a new 52 Week High at 41.00
"Myriad CEO Mark Capone resigned today, know the interim guy, he will not be permanent. I still see a drop to 15"
I hope the shorting is finally over...
Price took a dive 6 days before ER. Did the sellers take a lucky guess or was it good information?!
1/2. Of the revenue is going to be spent on legal fees. With all the class action suites. No good news coming anytime soon.
Note to shorts: up 3% more today. Lol

I'm happy to join those who are sharing the good news about Mr Grey I'm not persuading anyone to trade with him but I advice every investor to make the right choice with grey got my withdrawal safely without any interruption. Contact him and you will get more profit.. via Telegram @greywayne
"Stock broke all support today. Next stop is $20.It is difficult to value this stock. The company has a lot of overhead and they charge a lot for their tests. A drop in insurance reimbursement could wipe out their profit margin quickly. They do have high quality based on their massive database, but competition could eventually kill them."
$MYGN received good news from reimburser United Healthcare. They will pay for genetic test by Myriad Genomics.$BIOC should receive similar good reimbursement news. Up up up.
"There is no way this company can survive with its current leadership team, after 8 years with this co, this leadership team manages always after an event happens. They are so backwards. The stock value really should be in the 10-15$ range. Their Oncology products are mainly me too now as many companies have caught up and cut the prices! Not a good outlook for Myriad"
40 PER SH CASH OFFER EITHER THIS WEEK OR NEXT
over a 50% haircut for a company that specializes in genetic med.. lol the market is always giving gifts
Just hitting the wire now...insiders are starting to sell off their shares.
41% down was a bit steep. This is still oversold. Will see 26/27 by next week.
Uh... Buyout?

The news has been out for 3 hours and Yahoo still hasn't posted it. Waiting for the big guys to dump as many shares as possible before causing the next wave of selling perhaps?
Wow! It's not stop going down. I saw a small hike then going down further
MYGN reached a 52 Week low at 16.80
what news?
This will close at $33-$34.
Will close around $30 today. Way too overreacted.....
buy the dip

Anyone read the news article on the published study? Very impressive with strongly positive implications for MYGN stock.
been short since 42 ... gave up just went long @ 46.99
"Downgraded this morning by Barclays to $30 a share, currently down $1.68 pre-market."
Not sure if Goldman realizes MYGN is now the only FDA approved for BRAC. See you later fly by night labs. You need Myriad’s data base to make accurate decisions. Who wants efficacy rates of 40-60%. This is a live and death decision. Who doesn’t like 99% accuracy!
"This chart is beautiful right now, couldn't resist. Looks like a lovely entry point."
Myriad is one of the top genetic diagnosing and discovering new applications in the World.
anyone know why MYGN is down so much today in no news?
"As I stated yesterday, this stock is worth maybe 10-15 a share, if you own stock in Myriad, sell sell sell why you can. Now if Mark Capone gets replaced, forced out what ever and is replaced with a quality visionary that wallstreet respects, get back in big if you can."
those of you saying stock is worth 15 are just throwing out insane numbers.
We eating
always sell a stock before the earnings.
What happened to the healthcare provide orders? MYGN went up huge based on that news and then yanked twice on poor guidance?
Looking for a Roche/Myriad marriage soon.
Myriad Genetics reached a 52 Week low at 14.02
"This company has state of the art, effective tests for serious medical conditions. No one care. Stock tanks. Incredible."
"This is what I said 2 months ago on this board:""the problem is that analysts are only expecting at loss of $.44 this quarter. I am thinking more in the range of $.60 to $.80 based on the huge loss of business.""The actual loss for the quarter was -$.74. Absolutely horrible results, but investors were warned."
"After working for Myriad for 8 years, it continues to boggle my brain why the stock is not performing better. The two markets that are performing very well were acquired not organically grown. The Hereditary space has been impacted by companies with weaker data but it amazes me that they are still reimbursed by the same payers. Not a great trend! Ever since Myriad lost their Supreme Court case, Wall Street seems to have less faith in management based on the current stock price. Indication that maybe a leadership change is needed."
Missed for this quarter and giving big misses for next quarter and for next year. Lowering full year earnings from 1.70 to 1.10. Need to hope wall street is long MYGN. They will bring it back up some. If not it goes to the teens.
I'll hop back in with a pullback to $34.00
Happy I held ! Sold half my shares at a small lose but still holding. At one point I was down over $7000 !
Interest seems to be building in the 09/21 $43 & $41 Puts. That's an expected $3-5 drop in price over the next 2-weeks. Just an observation.
"anyone else following this stock besides me? big announcement today, looks like a great addition to an already strong product line. your thoughts?"
They were buying banks and selling pharma today.AMAT warned so hopefully MYGN will rise from heretomorrow and into next week.
"just 2 years ago Kiplingers called it a strong buy at $28, lol."
Just hit a new 52 week high. News?
What! They're offering up a new batch of 1.2M shares at $27.31 to their employees? What's that dilution going to do to the stock price?https://fintel.io/doc/sec/899923/000156459019002367/mygn-s8.htm
Earnings were outstanding!! The time to buy is now!!
"FYI: they gave the new CEO 1.3MM shares as part of his hiring package. must be nice. at $13.38 (702,888) and $12.33 (597,908)."
"Buying MYGN , is like buying EXAS for $12.40, which is in the same screening business. MYGN does not have the risk of Cologuard guard and Covid testing, both over priced tests, going obsolete."
"volume after hours. Looks like only sellers are retail investors!General business model has not changed and company has few more test that got approved by FDA, so it will take awhile before those take off. Institutions will hold and look to the future and see this drop as nothing more than a hiccup. Check at tomorrow morning and decide to buy or sell!Long term business model is intact and CEO got canned for producing wildly optimistic forecast. Looks like active board!Should see some covering tomorrow. What a joyous day for shorts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GLTA in stock casino!"
That was a last chance for shorts to cover below $26. Longs will take over from now on
"This company makes almost 800M in Revenues , but cash is only 148M...why is that? Seems like they need a cash influx."
"nice jump, but resistance is very strong up here. they will need a substantial effort to get to new highs."
Stock up today on interest to be purchased
MYGN is up 6.02% to 45.42
BINGO
https://discord.gg/u9mm4je
SHORT term option call play here? Wow with almost 31% shorted makes you think this was not to be such a surprise. Question is when will they start covering and ranking in?
"Fact - Myriad is the only company with 99% efficacy. All the other are fly by night jokes looking to take market share by lower prices. Unfortunately the patients are the ones who suffer with less than 50% efficacy test results. Image getting a mastectomy, then being told - sorry our bad, you didn’t need one. There should be a class action suit against insurance companies who forced patients to use one of these companies in the name of cost savings."
"I think it's pretty much what we thought, the initial 50%+ move up was short covering. Profits from any potential insurance endorsement are quite a few quarters away. In addition there are issues I've read that are headwinds. Regardless, the stock got way ahead of it's fundamental value."

"After working at Myriad for 9 years, reached out internally to find out what happen, it all came down to leadership under estimating revenue gap. It is time for a board change and definitely a CEO, COO change"
MYGN with a $2 B mkt cap has $835M revenue. EXAS has a $12 B mkt cap with $735M in revenue.That would value MYGN at $ 125.00 a share or EXAS at $ 13.30 a share.
That was a fun day!!
read the articles. Company in huge trouble.
Times are tough right now internally for Myriad (1) Hiring freeze for 90 days (2) leadership team across the board takes 30% reduction in salaries until further notice. (3)Bonuses / commission for ALL employees that qualify will take a 50% reduction in the 4th Qtr!

"Ge general electric invented new breast test, machhine"
good entry point?
Myriad announced today that UnitedHealthcare has issued a positive coverage decision for pharmacogenetic testing for multi-gene panels including the company’s GeneSight Psychotropic test. The coverage is for patients that have a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or anxiety and have failed at least one prior medication to treat their condition. The positive coverage decision is referenced in the UnitedHealthcare August 2019 Network Bulletin.
"EXAS, genetic testing co., with 1 product, cologuard, has risen from $5.93 to #118.00 recently - while MYGN is down 40% in one day. EXAS has never made a profit, its only test is $600.00 versus the FIT test at $20.00, and a blood test coming out will make their product obsolete."

"This is good news longer term for Myriad, but I think this is a huge overreaction, mostly fueled by a short covering surge."
this stock has been ripping higher last few weeks .. if it wants to consolidate for a while its earned it ..
Myriad Genetics is down 6.68% to 29.49
Anyone with any news or info on volume and price action? I’m thinking leaked news on fda resolution on genetics testing?
"with recent decision from united healthcare, Myriad will reach 30 again. Oversold"
tempted to get back in. bought at this level in 2013 and took a profit. read the posts and it seems to be even. my drawback is how long this market can keep climbing.
MYGN is up 6.35% to 38.83
chart may be saying we have bottomed. CCI looks about to give a buy signal after coming from -400 to about -100. Less than -100 generates a buy signal. MACD looks to have bottomed after falling due to the SP drop (Supoena). SP has bottomed (so far) @$29ish & has gone up to a little over $30. Any subpoena resolution in MYGN's favour will push the SP about $33. & maybe within striking distance of $41.
Myriad Genetics is down 5.71% to 29.48
"It looks like the price was run up based on the Morgan Stanley fake upgrade so less shares would be need for the acquisition. If so, the price will go back down since the deal is done."
MYGN reached a 52 Week low at 19.89
"Stock should be down 25% today, not just 8%. Every product in the portfolio is down on rev for the qtr"
WAY OVERSOLD! WILL CLOSE ABOVE 25 today. LOADING UP
This company has made profit and it goes down like this lol. Way over sold .. Great buying point
here we go again. time to buy cheap again. glad I don't trust their earnings and have started selling before

"I don't see people want to discuss in this stock which indicate me that the investors are not interested in this stock at all. The company outlook is not impressed too. I don't understand why on May 05th, 2020, the company announced the earnings report for the fiscal Third Quarter 2020, but I could not find the info about First and Second Quarters at all. It is very confused with this company. I was planning to jump in to this stock today, but may be hold on to it."
"Two concerns after listening to the CC. Big one for me is ""What the F... is going on with meaningful numbers of physicians ordering GeneSight for multiple unrelated choices (some now withdrawn)?!?! And I'm VERY concerned that the answer to that one may tie in with the FDA concerns about GeneSight. Tests are more akin to devices than to drugs, and FDA usually treads lightly....where they get excited is situations with physicians being taken out of treatment decisions. I can think of a whole bunch of ways that could show up in mish-mosh testing. Whatever the problem, I totally endorse the company's approach to communication ""We're in discussions with FDA. No further comment.""Except to the extent that it relates to aforementioned odd pattern of test ordering, I can't get concerned at all about the earnings miss. The analysts are never close guessing about Myriad. and the deviation is within a typical window."

I am curious how long whoever is propping nflx up will continue to do it before at least a 100 point decline.NFLX they can't and won't hold it up forever."
these idiots running myriad into the ground threw over a 1.2 billion into buybacks for a market cap of 1.1 billion. the stock would have been trading higher than this on cash position alone without a single share bought. bottom line is that they didnt expand overseas despite having 15 years to do it. they have not launched a single new test which gained any traction at all. the arthritis and prostate tests are commercial failures thusfar.
"FDA approval essentially ignored.It will slowly come back, once Covid related issues are balanced with companiesthat attempt to deal with cancer treatment.Sell off this morning was on light volume."

Currently at $44.64 in pre-market on 1.2 K shares traded.
Are all the sellers cashed out by now?
Nice short covering to hold up the price! Suspect those funds that bought in Nov drop are holding on for better weather!It will be long wait since projection for 2020 is 732M drop of 15% and loss of 80 cent/sh. Forget the pro forma or Non-GAAP. Loss is loss. Nothing to show for rest of year and considering the US health care is. Profitability has gone out the window. Check back in a year and hope that company is not languishing. While new business is possible but old business has competition so pricing power will erode!!Nothing doing for next 6-9 month!GLTA in stock casino!
Balance sheet for any company is important but more a reflection of it's past. Revenue and by default profits if rising is why investors are so obsessed with revenues. They feed everything all other metrics
Earnings and guidance were great!! An outstanding buy right now!!

There will be a big buying push the last hour of trading.
So the question here. Should I hold or sell and absorb my loses?
"ugly results...what else is there to miss? EPS miss, REV Miss, lowered guidance,, ouch"
so happy I sold. time to rinse and repeat. made so much on this volatility
News article says demand for Myriad's elective testing has fallen due to covid. All the reasons that the elective testing has merit have not changed. I call BS - certainly longer term.
Earning release being delayed another week to make adjustments to previous revenue streams? Sounds to me like some funny business going on with the financials.
"This is potentially a very serious subpoena that was issued today by the SEC. If you own the stock, you should be concerned."
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Technically looks like this thing going down towards $29.
Is 30% drop warranted after 10% drop in revenue and 20% miss on ER. WHo knows we will see tomorrow!Not worth shorting at this point!!!Roll the dice please!GLTA in stock casino!
"Myriad just had a major layoff, new Prez is making this company lean and hopefully aggressive with more competent sakes people. I was there for 8 years and all I saw was a bunch of pharma reps that couldn’t think on their own if their life depended on it! Myriad is getting primed for a sale!"
"Barclays just cut the price target yet again. This time from $30 down to $25, currently down $2.10 in premarket."
bought for first time on a gamble 50 shares. hope I can sell for 29 or 30 tomorrow
"Not touchable on the long or short side. MYGN's in nowheresville now - and with the chief splitting, my guess is further downside. Better off shorting something that popped, BIGLY, on earnings last night . . . popped just TOO much, like SYNA."
Missed by .03
this stock has been great the last year.
"It amazes me how a company will try to spin out a news release in mid day when their stock is under pressure. In this case, it seems that MYGN put out a press release that is actually old news that they're releasing again. Either that, or this press release was going to be released before markets open on another day, and they decided to release the news mid day today. Very rarely if ever does a company release news hours after the market opens."
I see we have a few profit-takers in the pre-market. It is my sincerest hope they regret doing that as others pile onto the good news from both Tuesday and today.
"Last week it was buy the rumor, this week it's sell on the news. Of course they let their buddies sell all morning before letting the lame news piece out about 'oh gee, the test worked', something we already knew."
does not matter in the slightest what test mygn has. they have proven that they are incapable of running a business. incapable of marketing their products and incapable of managing re-imbursements.
how can MYGN be worth 1.6 billion and have sales of 212 million in the next Q and EXAS has 218 million and are worth 10.9 billion????????????????? WHY?????????
MYGN reached a 52 Week low at 10.62
Buy at 21.15-21.70 range.
"Comical that this stock has gone up, they brought in a new ceo without any experience in Myriad’s market! Typical of Myriad and their board making a decision like this!"
No other company has a chance to replicate data base.It I’ll take 20 years to replicate necessary data base.
"Stock will drop to 15 and then it will be bought by a large Pharma company, only way it can survive! Payors no longer value the Myriad science behind their studies"
at least they are generating money.
No news on selloff? Maybe a brokerage downgrade? I can't find anything (yet).
Bill Alpert's article on Barrons makes me suspect the timing. It was released 7:26 pm on Friday night. Was it's release held until then to prevent price crash?
"If it crosses $50, watch out."
up 8% today and looking strong....
"Partnering with ILMN excellent, approval in Japan great, but mkt cap at only $2 B for MYGN is undervalued when EXAS, doing the same tests, has a mkt cap of $25 Billion."
Great win for Utah!
"Thought the stock would pop today by at least 10% which it did but I thought it would close at that level, it did not. Any thoughts on where it'll be at YE?"
"ALSO...in Davos Manuchin said a week US dollar is being preferred going forward & that would help world trade, but increase costs to the US consume as most commodities are not produced in the US & electronics companies will incur more costs (& pass along the costs to their consumers) when importing to the US. Maybe that is why STM, TSM etc. are down today irregardless of any $$$ repatriation. Importing inflation is the future for the US if USD is forced lower. Good for wages if you can get them."
would definitely expect this to reverse after cc-undervalued
The report was not bad and the balance sheet numbers point to a great quarter next round.DGX or LH could acquire this company.
It just hit 47.95 in premarket.
"https://www.labpulse.com/index.aspx?sec=sup&sub=pth&pag=dis&ItemID=800299I would say kind of relevant if you are market leader.........I hope Myriad smart enough to put this on their website, anybody send this to lazy IR dep :-)"
Note to shorts; up .9% pre market.
"Price is going down, once in single digits, big pharma steps in and gets a helluva co that has had terrible leadership that had created a distrust on wallstreet that drives the price it is today"
Why would anyone buy this stock?
Earnings tomorrow. Anyone with any thoughts?
I think this company will be bought out very soon and for double the current price! watch...very soon...
"I love the company and its products, but management is poor in information. normally a company will immediately put out a release saying they have received notice and are cooperating. it prevents panic and a ten percent. when the public doesn't hear anything it sounds guilty of something."
What’s the run today?
Myriad Genetic testing is down 40% this morning and it usually makes money. EXAS has never made money and its only product is obsolete.
This has been making strong up moves. Turnaround on deck? Good qtr coming? Its not uncommon for a new CEO to put out the worst of it right when they start to show a turnaround after theyve had the helm. Can see this flying over $30 possibly $40 pretty easily.
"GOOD earnings, PLUS very good future estimates. Up 4+%."
CONGRATS to buyers <20.51 see all back over 25 ish soon
something's up? did poor earnings numbers leak?
"Newbie here, sorry for not knowing more but what is the near term catalyst here? thank you"
"It will open at $2 tomorrow, stay short"
"Myriad will be a great buy @ 10, and IF the board changes out the appointed CEO"
And there it is: Prolaris Test Accurately Predicts Risk of Metastasis in Men Diagnosed with Localized Prostate Cancerhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/prolaris-test-accurately-predicts-risk-112857407.html
"Am I understanding the situation correctly? After having perused the cc transcript, it's clear that they have known for months that existing revenue and income guidance would be wildly off. If true, why wasn't a warning issued in a more timely way?? It certainly seems to raise questions about management's ability to stay on top of, and/or communicate, the need for adjustments caused by reduced revenue accrual rates."
I bought more!
No one should be surprised. Short percent of float was sky high.Avoid stocks with super high short interest levels because that's a big red flag indicating that shorts are significantly more aware of potential risk factors than the average small Investor.MTNB 
"Its all about the leadership at Myriad, wall street would love a change"
"Guys check out ADAP, Cart-T researcher. Very undervalued."
MYGN is looking poised for another 10% leg up! Thumbs up if you agree!
why all of a sudden pop?... any big news out there?
Barclays analyst Jack Meehan now sees a 35% chance (vs. 20% previously) that Myriad Genetics' (MYGN -7.9%) GeneSight test could lose out on Medicare coverage.He trims his price target to $18 from $20.
good company all I would like to say that instead of selling BUY and HOLD
on a 5 day trade basis SP coming down to test the uptrend line. Personally I don't see a cup & handle formation
UBER what a bargain...remember FB starting up and look at it now
Below $46 before close
"Don't listen to the suddenly ""helpful"" posters who would scream ""fire"" in a crowded theatre, and now want to encourage you to sell your shares to preserve capital. Click on their names and look at their posting history and you will see much of the same behavior of multiple boards. Does anyone here know how much the revenues have been for medicaid/medicare? From what I know they usually refuse to pay for this testing? But at worst, the company will have to repay some money and fix any billing issues. Hopefully MYGN comes out with an improved formal statement and defense of their practices today."

Nice day for MYGN!
What is going on? Some good news?.....
MYGN is down -5.89% to 31.18
3 day rule.. I am a buyer at 17.50 if it hits that number before 3 days. If not I will buy on Thursday. I dodged a pretty big bullet today. I had 2k at 25 and sold at 34. Whew!
"As a consequence of really bad Management stock price crashes. Obviously, MYGN underestimated the impact of the deletion of the historical hereditary cancer CPT codes 81211 and 81213 beginning on January 1, 2019. These two codes are the sequencing and large rearrangement codes used for BRCA testing. Codes regularly change once in a while. MGYN has a large number of small (non-contracted) payers who they did not manage to crosswalk them to the new billing codes. In fact, they did not even notice a significant number of claims even in the last quarter. They are now sitting on a pile of adjudicated claims for 9 months after the coding change. Makes you wonder how that actually could happen.MYGN CEO also admitted to not have anticipated that there might be a competitor in the space grabbing market share. He also admitted to not have thought of that there might be some other type of business model which could provide for such rapid disruption. I wonder who he was speaking of."
MYGN has a mkt cap of only $1.2 B. It does the same type of tests as EXAS at $$18.7 B. What a joke!
"Move your cash over to FMI , the new leader in genetic screening"
so is there any risk from all these lawsuits. seems like a bunch of people crying in their Cheerios because the stock got pumped by investors and shorts.
Glad I sold this today. Weird stuff going on.
Would love to buy at this price around $24 but looks like it will fall to 19
Myriad Genetics reached a 52 Week low at 14.85
impressive quarter!
laughable place on the company web site for breaking news. still nothing about the government notice. totally ignoring share holders as we lose money.
This will drop well into the teens before support. They have been given multiple chances after poor earnings. AH will be highest price you see for awhile...............
"I think I may have a good chance to buy it at $19.50. It may go lower, but I want to take a risk at this price and I plan to average down if it continues falling. It's a good gambling for me."
"Most of the breakthroughs in medicine of the future will be because of genetics. MYGN at under $2B mkt cap is a gift with its multitude of products. Compare that to EXAS with only one inaccurate expensive product, testing stools, yet the stock has a mkt cap of over $10B."
sold before the earnings call. fooled me once...
"Now have to revise ""A rising tide lifts all boats"" to ""most boats"". Very clearly manipulation involved here."
There's an awful lot of adjusted this and adjusted that being mentioned in the conference call. That usually means things were pushed around to make the numbers they put out sound better than they were.
MYGN is up 5.18% to 30.48
when do they announce their test for coronavirus??
Prolaris gets the nod of approval in the market place....Nice tailwind for this stock which has been on fire last 12 months!
Shocker that Myriad moved a little positive today! Wanted to buy the co at 8
"this stock locked lots of institution funds by the sudden reversal move, not active message board"
earnings pretty good
"FOR THIS STOCK TO BE SITTING ALMOST AT 52 WEEK LOW IS TOTAL MANIPULATION, AL CAPONE, NEEDS TO PUT UP FOR SALE"
"Some news came out, but does not seem to be negative. No really sure."
Lets see. Based on 1-3 Day Technical readings. It should go up. So Day traders or people who like to hold stocks for short times buying now is great. Just remember to put a stop loss just in case @ 21
MYGN reached a new 52 Week High at 39.10
Profits Unlimited had a special report(s) about must buy stocks & one of them was MYGN.Can any one say why the stk is down this am by over 1%?
typical over reaction . loses 740 million in cap. buy under 20.
Cup and handle breakout emanate!
Is this dropping for down adjustments for future earning? Who knew about this several days ago when the shares traded was almost five times the average and dropped almost $5 at opening. Looks like insider trading to me.
