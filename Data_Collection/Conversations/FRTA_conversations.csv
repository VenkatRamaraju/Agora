frontier capital managment increased holding
Solid as a rock.
For a stock that is so quiet I have gained substantially on this one. Bought it at 4$ and some change about 2 years ago. Rarely any news but I work in road and bridge work and consistently see and use the products they build is the main reason I dove in at the low stock price. Infrastructure is constantly changing
"Pre-market trading to the positive on FRTA. Pre-market trading is unusual for FRTA especially this early. Without a doubt I am committed to this company and sold off all other stocks to buy more in the $4s pullback. Having powder for the $3s would've been better LoL.Big Picture - this is a $20 plus stock when infrastructure starts it's forward momentum. Ultimately, my belief, $60s - seriously.Morning coffee and feeling good."
Love this infrastructure company! Tremendous footprint from coast to coast able to rebuild our water/drainage infrastructure system. I've picked up 25k shares and look forward to $23 in 2018 and $60 by 2022.
Looking at their institutional holders report... vanguard picked up 1.3M shares. Somethings a brewin 
The earnings call is going to be very positive!The last earnings call gave us this heads up.

Don't know why GreatDay keeps low balling FRTA's potential. Got lucky and bought at $5 and will hold for a 10 bagger over the next year or so.
This company reminds me of valiant. Tried to increase valuation through acquisitions and debt.

Less than a year ago FRTA was over $10 and the company wasn't as strong as it is now. Also today FRTA has better business prospects and management. Time to revisit the IPO price - plus.
what now ??
Nice ... luving the double digits...seems like this company should do well in my opinion/ hope since so many areas need updated..I'll hold on to my shares for the long haul

infrastructure bill will send this to $20
Did some pipes collapse?
FRTA is down -12.50% to 7.68
"CNBC had a good lengthy talk on Trump""s 2018 agenda and Infrastructure talk was the big topic, both parties are for it, they said everyone wants safe bridges and no pot holes etc. I see this company benefiting tremendously."
"The corporate tax cut, reduced regulations and increased demand on water and drainage infrastructure, along with the possibility to supply precast concrete walls along the border. These are the beams of opportunity for FRTA that has a coast to coast footprint allowing immediate supply to projects. This is not a day trader stock, this is a 5 year plan with huge rewards. $23 in 2018$60 in 2023"
"As it was in the time of Noah so shall it be when Jesus returns to establish his kingdom on Earth. In Noah's time many great wonders were built, the pyramids in Egypt and Mexico, while FRTA and US pipe have mastered the art of stealing US PIPE retiree insurance while they skip town to London."
Management just took a pay cut.
I'm afraid that the earnings not going to look good
"Democrats and Republicans both have indicated a willingness to make middle-class tax cuts permanent. Whoever becomes the new Chair of the House Ways & Means Committee should reach out to the GOP ranking member to co-sponsor a bill to do just that.- Infrastructure programs have usually benefitted from bipartisan support. A bipartisan bill investing in our roads, bridges, water and sewer projects is something everyone can get behind.- “Fighting for Fair Trade” has been a battle cry of traditional Democrats for years. House Democrats should find ways to work with the Trump administration to enhance efforts to make our trade environment benefit workers.Nancy Pelosi declared in her victory speech Tuesday night that we all have had enough of division."
not bothered very low volume
Volume drying up is never a good sign; just sayin'.
"Guys, some inside info for you. This company is not without it's problems. I'll leave it at that. FRTA will be a great play on infrastructure, but I see that happening as more of a economic stimulus when we see a major down turn. JMHO don't go hating."
FBM is another good company that will skyrocket when infrastructure starts
"Last earnings call demonstrated infrastructure business was there that they were bidding on, even without the new infrastructure bill. The money is coming from the states. the US government will be a huge added bonus though, in short time."
The good stuff will be in the conference call.

"Wow, this had a nice run but seems to have been DOWNTRENDING for almost a month now. With the overall market and economy doing so well this doesn't bode well for this (in)security, in my humblest view."
"FRTA's business has not slowed down at all, only increased. Now with less debt and no looming judgements since last quarter... Their business - 50% state and municipality, 25% commercial real estate, 25% residential new construction (exploding) Builders expected 2020 to be a good year for housing, but not even the most brilliant of forecasters could have predicted sales in August to be up over 50% year over year in some markets!"
$18 by end of January. $23 by end of 2018.$60 by end of 2023....Watch.
560 million market cap....1.2 billion debt = no one is buying this
Earnings are expected next week but I've heard late February early March.
Remember the last earnings call? Over the last quarter FRTA has been setting up for strength and very reduced debt. Infrastructure has been taken place across the country and this earnings call should be a springboard.
"Water, drainage, bridges will move FRTA in to the $30s late 2018, early 2019..."
something to keep in mind . institutions own 100 pct of this stock . .when that happens they wait for the stock to be oversold and jump in for larger gains . the stock is now at the bottom of its chart and showing a buy signal
$23 in 2018.
The chart is looking like this time we'll break through $6s and climb into the $8s
"Lots of restricted shares again distributed to the insiders , which tells me the will come with good earnings"
Great momentum play shorts remaining waiting it out on its way under 7
I got filled at $6.62 and had a buy limit in at $7.30. Must of been some big sellers at the open.
"FRTA is a long range investment, not a short term play. Tremendous potential long play."
"they beat both , earnings + revenues"
"Taking the last earnings call into account and press releases regarding infrastructure money being spent by private and state money across the country, I'll expecting a very positive call in a couple of weeks."
this is such a good long term investment. $20 in six months. lets go!
$$$$$ buy it..hold it..don't trade it...you will make money
Any thought on the impact on the ER by the COVID-19?
It's time for investors to start rotating into FRTA. The future is theirs!
"The outlook is little vague but they are well positioned the Company’s outlook, Mr. Watson stated, “While we are pleased with the robust quarterly results, our visibility into the remainder of 2020 and beyond is still clouded by the uncertainly surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to sales volumes, funding of projects, and the overall economy. Based on recent trends in our backlogs, along with other factors, we expect shipment volumes in the second half of the year to continue to be lower than the prior year level as they were during the first half. That said, we believe we are favorably positioned to confront any future market challenges just as we have this quarter"
6 ÷ 7 insiders bought shares of the FRTA.very good sign
"Dear Investors, following last week’s news on favorable arbitration results, we have just put out two more press releases this afternoon, announcing: Lone Star Funds, our ~69% shareholder, has decided to sell 10 million of their shares (with a 15% overallotment) under the S-3 that was filed last December; andWe have notified our Term Loan administrator that we intend to prepay $100 million of the term loan on this Thursday, 9/17."
"Why the big drop, with no news on stock & tax bill passing? Does not make since. Manipulation and/or profit taking. Thoughts please"

Whatever is happening it seems they have a good handle on costs keeping their gross margins at low to mid 80%. Q4 2017 was profitable. Looks like Q1 is on the weakish side which is reasonable bad weather and all. Summer month quarters are much stronger like 100 million per quarter stronger than Q1.

I can only attribute this selling to cleaning up the books for the end of the year. There is no news and no weather events that would have affected FRTA's manufacturing. It should be all good after earnings report on 11/06.

$12 plus on Monday....
I sold my position last week because of the strained relationship of both parties in Congress. It simply shows that there is very little chance of an Infrastructure spending bill and spending for hurricane damage repairs during 2018.Good Luck to all.

Fantastic arbitration news that we are waiting for! along with all the other great financial information....
"Today.The Democratic leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives is ready to engage in meaningful discussions with the Trump White House on a comprehensive infrastructure bill, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said April 2.The Democrats’ infrastructure measure, she added, would include environmental provisions, as well as go beyond the White House’s 10-year, $1.5 trillion private sector-centric proposal that failed to connect with lawmakers last year. Pelosi (D-Calif.) also emphasized that about 75% of the conversations she has had with President Donald Trump have included infrastructure policy, to a certain extent.“We’re ready to talk, you know. We’re ready to talk to see where we can find our priorities,” Pelosi said at an event that Politico hosted in Washington. “This issue has never been a partisan issue. Over time, we’ve always been able to work together in a bipartisan issue.”"
I hate to say this.... But we broke through the support. The next support is in the high $4 level. Great things with the water infrastructure bill that are currently in the Senate. I'm in search of more investment money for the next support line. FRTA is still a huge winner after this correction.
$23 in 2018$60 in 2023with all DD taken into account.
"Google and read (why FRTA is likely going to $30 plus in the coming years): ""Building America's Future Educational Fund (BAF Ed Fund) is a bipartisan coalition of elected officials dedicated to bringing about a new era of U.S. investment in infrastructure that enhances our nation's prosperity and quality of life.""Read about: Water, Highways, etc."

The infrastructure bill is finally coming to fruition. There's a reason why multiple highly regarded hedge funds own tens of millions of dollars of Fortera. FRTA.
SunTrust bank upgraded FRTA Buy $ 19 today
"Secondary stock issuance before Labor Day. Debt-ridden, money losing company. No turnaround in sight as infrastructure is post-2020 event at best. Need to de-leverage the company and the only way is selling more stock. “New” management doesn’t mean no old problems. Goldman trying to do secondary deal above $5.00 so has to pump up the price prior. Goldman’s other note today was to sell CAT, a money-making company because the “industrial economy is slowing.” How does tgat square with “oh, let’s buy FRTA.” Get out or short quickly friends. I sold today."
OMER may buy out
Trump has said that he is going to stall the infrastructure bill and any other legislative proposals if Democrats dig up his IRS records or continue to extend the Russian investigation. Wonder if that has something to do with today’s drop.

"Forterra upgraded to Buy from Hold at SunTrust SunTrust analyst Rohit Seth upgraded Forterra to Buy from Hold with a price target of $19, up from $12. The analyst sees the company as a ""levered small-cap infrastructure and housing play"" and believes that its underappreciated pricing and margin expansion story, along with several catalysts, can drive up its shares by as much as 70% in the next 6 months. Seth adds that Forterra had managed well during the Covid-related disruption of activity, as evidenced by its 10% ASP growth and 400bps in margin expansion, while noting its potential benefits from the increase in Federal government's highway spending and support in its current valuation multiples."

We urge you to reach out to your Members of Congress and ask them to reach across the aisle to develop and pass a infrastructure bill this Congress.This is in line with ASCE’s recommendations to raise the grades in the 2017 Infrastructure Report Card. Simply stated, our infrastructure requires increased funding, leadership, and a commitment to making good ideas a reality. In addition to the Report Card’s solutions, ASCE specifically offered Principles for Infrastructure Investment that should be used as guiding principles for a federal infrastructure package.We can no longer afford to defer investment in our nation’s infrastructure. To close the $2.0 trillion 10-year investment gap, meet future need, and restore our global competitive advantage, we must increase investment from all levels of government and the private sector from 2.5% to 3.5% of U.S. We need you to reach out to your Members of Congress to urge them to put forward a long-term plan to improve our infrastructure systems."

"All around the city the ductile iron water pipe are breaking and cracking, forcing local users to repair leaks at great cost. Several reasons exist for the drop in quality of ductile iron pipe. The switch to scrap steel rather than pig iron caused the pipe to have a limited life span. Changing the minimum weight to negative 5% shortchanged the customer and caused a marginal product at best to become subject to early and premature failures. Changing the test pressure duration time to 5 sec, insured that very few leaks and cracks would be detected. The pipe should be tested to 80% of elasticity for 15 seconds to prove it can survive decades of stress under major cities. CI and six sigma have corrupted the ductile pipe industry by shifting production and manufacturing to below minimum standards for ductile pipe. All pipe should pass the ductility test with a ten or better instead of the 7 ductility accepted now. When the industry shifted from Blast furnace iron to scrap steel, trap metals limited the life cycle of ductile iron pipe. The practice of manufacturing and selling ultra thin pipe made with scrap steel, with 5 sec pressure test, and low ductility insures the tax payer will be stuck with decades of cracked and leaking pipe.The industry has lost the technological skill to produce a quality pipe that will survive decades of stress in the ground. For example their are 20 pipe breaks within five miles of my office, all breaks on ductile iron pipe manufactured with scrap steel and 6 sigma concepts of minimum quality. Not leaking pipe, recently acquired breaks. Not an infrastructure investment problem but a manufacturing flaw that was created by lack of technological skills of executives."

Analysis of the drop anyone? Release indicated good earnings and improvement in execution. I am missing why the sell-off.
profit taking no big deal
Added yesterday. Downtrend is overdone imo
It was only public for what like 5yrs? Going private. The stock has made a nice move over the year. Little disappointed I will own no more.
Sell or Buy? Opinions
Am I the only investor that owns more than just a few hundred shares other than the millions of shares owned by the stable large institutional investors?No news equates to way too much volatility on this thinly-traded stock.
So? What's your thoughts?
Any discussion on the actual numbers and market perception as opposed to ours?
infrastructure spending to start in the fall of this year for water and drainage.
Small steps up to ($23 plus) in 2018.
Can someone share their thoughts on whether this was a good earnings period? % years is too long for me to want to be in this trade

Today's results represent a move in the right direction, but we have much further to go as we work to earn a full and fair return for the products we produce and the capital we deploy."""
