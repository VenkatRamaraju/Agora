this has to be one of my worst investments to date.
"No need to worry, folks. The hospitality sector have been taking hits but I think it wouldn’t be down for an entire quarter according to the inoculation rate. People in European and Asian countries are as well pushing it through so countries wouldn’t only need to be surviving in domestic tourism.I have been long in HHC for a long time."
Pure garbage. Even airlines are doing better
I had an opportunity to break even. Now looks like this will go in the loss column.
HHC is down 9.19% to 54.31
This board was a ghost town two days ago. LMAO.
Good ridden’s. Upper management was handed this jewel after the meltdown. Selling the corporate jet tells me everything I needed to know.
"For once we are seeing some movement . I await the new management team and their vision for the future of HHC. I quess I'll hold onto my shares for a little longer. Thanks Bill Ack,,,,,"
my new conviction is that this is worse than airlines. Because governments will/have really bail/bailed out airlines. Ackman really made a mistake here. Thank God this only takes a small percent of his portfolio
"Biggest problem with this company is no one follows it. When new analysts initiate ratings, it’s time to buy!"
I see people leaving Cali and moving to texas every day because of tax laws and bc of how bad cali is rn. Which building company do I invest in in order to jump on that future! Somethings gotta explode soon am i right!
Is there an published history of this company?
Is the pre market -3.22 for real???
if you are thinking about this stock you should look at their hawaii condos ... ward village.... they are outstanding
HHC is up 5.57% to 94.64
"In addition, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, acting as investment advisor to funds that it manages, including Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd., Pershing Square International, Ltd., and Pershing Square, L.P. (collectively, the ""Pershing Square Funds""), pursuant to which, the Pershing Square Funds will purchase, at the same price as the offering price, an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, for estimated aggregate net proceeds of $488,000,000."
"I'm no expert in HHC, but I suspect the drastic drop is because of their heavy presence in houston. The oil patch is going to be decimated from a combination of low prices, oversupply and dropping demand. Oil companies will certainly be laying off workers. But I think Houston is a lot more than an oil town these days with a fairly diverse work force (though perhaps Oil pays the highest salaries). SS seaport does not look in the near term but that should be fairly short term."
This company has characteristics of a tech company. It would reinvest all of its profits into new projects for future cash flows. Quite interesting.
Rumor has it HHC has been sold. Anyone else heard the same thing?
back up the truck !
HHC is down 9.96% to 36.39
Earnings should be good for Q2 after lumpy revenue in Q1.
Let it ridee

So vaccine news means HHC flat. What will ever lift this? Nothing will.
HHC is up 8.80% to 47.87
"shorted at 78.8 and covered, great stock to trade"
why is this not finding any bottom. They are selling like crazy in Houston.
"on 9/03/2021 pershing square bought 150,000 shares at 92.00 per share. i remember not lang ago ackman bought huge at 50 per share. he is the chairman of the board of directors. who else would know better what the value of hhc is ? he now owns over 24 percent of the company...."
just shorted more!
We hit the 100 mark. Let’s pop the champagne !!!
Worst housing data in Dallas and Houston. Yet another corona spike in Houston. I see 35 dollars in the weeks ahead!
HHC is down -4.98% to 129.76
"A 1.06 Billion Cash Position, hum, what to do; Maybe a Stock Buyback, probably not since only have 55 million Shares Out, short term benefit only... Dividends, usually only benefits Institutionals that hold Millions of shares... Pay down Debt, nah, that's no Fun and not a burden... How about put it to use and invest for the long run in a Development in one of the fastest growing areas of the Nation like the Austin/San Antonio Corridor where Tesla, Google, Apple, Wayfair are setting up. Or the Phoenix Arizona area where The I-10 Corridor is having enormous growth with Incoming Companies and the expanding Semiconductor High Techs like Intel and TSMC..."
The Howard Hughes is up 4.95% to 90.73
it should be headed to 130
After hours up 5% with decent volume. Something exciting brewing?
Pre mkt up 7.42? Who’s the generous one who bought at such a high price? 
Poor bulls
"silent killer, let hope this continues its run. whoever is reading this is probably a smart investor."
Somebody jumped today wanted to get in real fast
This stock is a no brainer... easily 100+
"""...with over 2,000,000 square feet of new developments in Downtown Columbia, MD; Ward Village in Honolulu; Summerlin in Las Vegas; and Bridgeland in the Houston region.""All demo-socialist areas."

HHC is down 11.20% to 49.24
its going to take another 20% beating tomorrow
HHC is down 12.49% to 72.73
isn't this some #$%$ stock?
Is that babe on the Hughesnet ad available? I would do that.
Up to $59 after market..My bags are a little heavy.
As expected!
"Since I am a shareholder of pershing square, am actually slightly annoyed that Ackman bought 500m of this #$%$ Only up 10% since his purchase."
"Will their New York, NY properties offset gains in Texas and Vegas? What percent of their portfolio is in NY v. the warmer, lower tax areas? Anybody know? I am interested in the stock, am leery of real estate with the amount of building that has already taken place. It looks like we will end up with a glut, like after the 2008 fiasco in Real Estate. Thanks"
Not including forward contracts Pershing Sq. Owns 22% of HHC- it makes all the sense to take company private with a couple of PE shops at book 68-70. All cash for 34 mill shares that Ackman doesn’t own. Privately sell off assets restructure and when valuations improve go public at better valuation
"End of year target is $60! This stock depends heavily on recovery, it's still early to buy."
This thing is going back to 50
HHC is down 4.95% to 90.64
Howard Hughes is up 11.20% to 47.35
earnings better than expected
HHC is up 10.36% to 48.49
HHC reached a 52 Week low at 75.67
Why isn't Bill rescuing HHC with share buybacks???
What's with the huge Pre-market jump?
HHC is drifting further away fr SPG. What’s happening?
shorted!
HHC is down 17.32% to 106.15
I hope Ackman is buying up shares as this continues to slide
"Bought this when Bill did and have been selling in the high 50s. Only problem is, now there are rumours of goimg private or selling the company. That leaves me stuck holding, don't want to miss out on that transaction."
"Market 2400 HHC 55,Market 2600 HHC 55,Market 2800 HHC 55,Market 3000 HHC 55,Market 3200 HHC 55 lol"
still lagging the market
Vaccine comes out: everyone sells HHC.
HHC reached a 52 Week low at 90.89
"This thing opened up 15%, and then 2 hours later they make an announcement? somebody was sharing or acting on material inside information."
Selling $2b in real estate and the corporate jet. Bad news...
Can I get a most recent annual report sent to me?
Do we see a positive surprise with the earnings?
HHC is down 9.39% to 41.03
"When first announced months ago (6/27/19 to be exact), its stock went from 92 to 131;no entity came forward to buy HHC with $3.5B in debt scared them all away;now changed in management, move HQ, sell non-core assets;another reason management claim HHC stock hasn't moved cause its misunderstood; a development REIT, instead of managing properties.Don't see much upside move: 100 to 120 range bound."
"As I said, fair market value is 60. No matter how much the intrinsic value is, it's still useless when the market wouldn't realise that. You don't want to be the ONLY company that does the single thing which no other RE developers do. This is the worst thing when it comes to the psychology of the market."
If you had listened to me and sold you would probably would've made money
To any new investors this stock stays low key and only goes up!!
"They are so desperate equity was sold at 30% dilution. 2Q will be pretty awful as all hotels closed. $4.4B in debt mostly secured by properities can result in defaults by specific assets. If residential assets start to see non-payment of rents, we go back to $35."
HHC is up 5.43% to 80.83
ohh boy its going to get ugly tomorrow
Great earnings! hopefully we see a steady climb back over $100 SP .

HHC reached a 52 Week low at 72.26
Howard Hughes is down 5.22% to 104.05
HHC is down 11.12% to 47.55
They better sell out to blackstone or alike. The highest they ever got was $160 back in 2014 i believe.
HHC is down 7.91% to 60.63

Howard Hughes is up 9.49% to 71.33
HHC is up 11.04% to 56.22
No mention of increasing shareholder value. Management continues to get paid. Operating expenses continue to rise. I don't like where this is headed.
Nothing from the new management team?
well we are over 60 again......
issuing bonds to repay its current debt. Giant Ponzi scheme!
my only concern is the huge amount of forclosures that are hittling the court system and will eventually the real estate market
Howard Hughes is down 4.94% to 98.76
What does the ceo mean when he says the share price is below the net asset value per share? Is that the all time high?
"""Now on to the results of the quarter. We kick-started the year with a strong first quarter across all aspects of the business. The acceleration of new home sales and condo sales displayed in the second half of 2020 carried into the New Year. We also saw improvements within our operating assets that were impacted by COVID, which is very encouraging as we continue to see signs of recovery across our retail and hospitality portfolio. During the quarter, we took steps to fortify our balance sheet and proactively issued $1.3 billion of senior notes in an effort to further diversify our funding sources, term out our debt maturities, and lower our overall cost of debt. The combination of these events has allowed us to accelerate 2 million square feet of development in our core MPCs, and we continue to look for additional opportunities ahead.Within our MPC segment, new home sales, a leading indicator for future land sales, increased a staggering 35%, selling 929 new homes, 241 homes above the same period last year. MPC earnings before tax, or EBT, increased 44% to $63 million in Q1 of 2021 compared to Q1 of 2020, largely driven by higher custom lot sales in Summerlin and an increase in the number of units closed at The Summit, our joint venture with Discovery Land Company. It is also important to highlight these results were achieved without closing a single super-pad sale in Summerlin during the quarter.These figures showcase the volume of residents flocking to our communities, despite economic headwinds, that have negatively impacted the US economy for over a year. We believe the robust demand in our MPCs will continue for at least the remainder of the year, which gives us the confidence to raise our full year MPC EBT guidance. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we provided MPC EBT guidance for 2021 in a range of $180 million to $200 million. Following the results of the first quarter, we are now targeting a range of $210 million to $230 million. Correne will provide additional details on our MPC segment a bit later, as the increases in acres sold and price per acre provided the support to adjust our guidance.Our operating assets performed well during the quarter with a 10% sequential increase in NOI across the portfolio. One of the leading drivers of this increase was retail, which improved by 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The largest factors contributing to this increase were driven by our two largest retail footprints, Ward Village and Downtown Summerlin with NOI rising 55% and 44%, respectively. We've seen foot traffic steadily return to our retail locations, which has resulted in a corresponding increase in collections. During the first quarter, collections improved to 78%, the highest retail collection rate since the onset of the pandemic. These results are encouraging and demonstrate that we are well on our way to recovery as we move closer to pre-COVID levels.Perhaps the hardest hit area of our operating asset portfolio over the past year was our hospitality assets in The Woodlands. During the quarter, we nearly broke-even as we recorded a net operating loss of $147,000 compared to a net operating loss of $236,000 last quarter. While our three hotels continue to make steady improvements, business and leisure travel still remain at significantly lower levels relative to what they were a year ago. We've seen a slight increase in occupancy in our hotels over the last quarter, and we are hopeful this will continue throughout the year."""
Its being run as a private company at expense of investors. Carl could turn this boat. Where are you Carl?
Unbelievably undervalued! Outside of Ackman I don't think other investors truly understand how undervalued the share price is relevant to the amazing assets HHC owns! Just look at the all the beautiful land this gem owns..
One of the best performer in my portfolio!! Still has room to move up
$100 by today!!!! 
"New sales in Honolulu get a Mercedes lease for 3-years, 5% commission to the brokers, and other concessions... they are in ""bring us any offer and we will take it"" mode. Nothing moving. This stock going down down down."
"earning gains wiped out, #$%$ Corp it is!"
HHC is up 8.92% to 40.78
"Hello bulls, still can't break 60"
Book value 68 per share stock at 47 looks like a screaming buy
"SO many businesses, celebreties and masses of people moving to Texas. Sheesh Rogan and Musk are just a few of those giant names. Is this stock a buy? Is the texas real-estate market about to explode? Please help me out is this the Texas real-estate stock to be in right now?"
"s&p 3400 while this is still below 60, as I said it is too early to buy"
HHC is down 4.93% to 106.54
The selling force is strong today. There is massive resistance at around 60 dollars a share. Of course the end of year target is 60.
HHC is up 5.00% to $94.34
I don't understand why people are blindly bullish on this? This is effectively the same as owning airlines in the short term.
"Bill Ackman sold 6.9 million put options on HHC, with a $115 strike, expiring between Jan-Aug 2021......seems to support the speculation that Pershing might be planning to take HHC private in coming months, with a price north of $115.https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5036244"
"""overvalued"".....short and long-term trend ""down""........but....projected price $130........yahooooes scores again"
Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
ONCE THIS CONSOLIDATION IN THE MARKET IS DONE IT WILL SKYROCKET GOD DAAM GME AND AMC DUMMY TRADERS
"Just realised Baillie Gifford is a big shareholder of HHC. BG is a better firm than Blackstone, also biggest outside shareholder of Tesla."
Do you see what I mean?
"Listened to the conf call. 105 the stock is a deal. Management stated that they personally will be buyers of the stock and the company will be doing a buyback. They probably have a day or two waiting period before they can buy after the announcement. With a thin float, I see tremendous support in the stock and great upside from the current price."
This should find a bottom. Home builders are hitting highs as real estate prices are staying strong.
Spike will not last longer
insider sales just sink this one for me.
Howard Hughes is down 6.56% to 56.12
down she goes
Why would you invest in this trash. If you want RE exposure buy brookfield

HHC reached a 52 Week low at 64.51
"I am the ONLY bear here, that’s how I know I am right"
Howard Hughes is up 5.03% to 92.66
What a scam! Typical Wall St pump and dump. Hope retail investors did not buy at these inflated prices.
I think it's time for a management shakeup. The only ones making money on this stock are it's high paid executive employees. It's also time for HHC to start paying dividends or buying back it's stock. Maybe then we would see a rise in the price of this stock.
"This stock is becoming another of Ackman's nemesis. I have seen lot of new developments in Bridge land, but the stock doesn't seem to take off? Anyone has any clue?"
Sorry guys it's time to sell it. Held without trying to influence anyone I hope you all made some nice coin
"Prepare for a sell off, It.s time for Bill to take this company private,"
Howard Hughes is up 5.09% to 72.90
I think ackman is working on taking this private.... every couple of months he buys some more.... up to over 24 percent now...
shorts taking it in the shorts today
HHC is down -4.94% to 130.43
HHC is down 5.12% to 107.33
HHC reached a 52 Week low at 87.86
so buying at 36.35 per share seems to be a good idea. they need to start running the company like a reit.
apparently Ackman bought and sold Google in March then bought HHC. Not great...
this stock is dead
HHC reached a new 52 Week Low at $111.50
"if the market goes up this company is flat. when the market is down, this company is down. Just look at the track record of the stock price for the past few years"
Questions need to be raised after the earnings release and subsequent conference call with upper management. This stock has underperformed the market this year by 12%
The force is strong today! 
BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE
HHC reached a 52 Week low at 44.56
"Hahaha everyone is quiet here, have you sold your HHC yet? if not you probably should"

HHC reached a 52 Week low at 78.20
Loading up the boat!!!
It’s heartening to see the share price of HHC closing in with SPG. $100 here we come!!!
I own Ackman's Pershing Square so I hope this will go up. Realistically I don't think it will.
Bill Ackman loves this stock.
expensive con game played by wall street crooks.
HHC is down 6.82% to 97.34
"Where is the news on stock buybacks? Where is the announcements regarding a dividend? Where is the increase in the stock price? Year end report is all about exec compensation, merit increase and incentives for 2019. I really don't know why I continue to hold onto this stock."
HHC reached a new 52 Week Low at $108.73
"HHC Sale of 2,500,000 shares at $127.86 per share by Director Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. on 01/02"
so bill ackman the chairman of the board bought 500 million of this stack at 50/share 6 months ago. I guess he is doing ok
interesting over 94 percent of the stock held by institutions
