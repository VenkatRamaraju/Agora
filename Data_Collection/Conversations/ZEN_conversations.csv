Way too overreaction. Will close above $100. O worries
11B mc for a company does over 1B revenue? This is the one of best bargain tech stock.

Best on Revenue and met EPS. Raised guidance. But dropping 15%? Thats interesting
What an overreaction... thankfully it has provided a discount that can't be missed. I've just doubled my holding and looking forward to reaping the rewards in 5 years
This one is going to be a big winner . Give the market time to correct . Their growth is far ahead of Salesforce which expected about 3.5bps next year which is anemic . This stock will outperform the S&P easily
"Good shorting opportunity, it will fall below 80"
Will drop tomorrow
Drop should be temporary with the ER beat. Lot of activist on the parent company that will derail tis merger anyway. Analysts just shirted and wanted quick bucks. Will keep recovering throughout the day and next week.
Is it a good entry point?
So now it looks like the ATH is in for ZEN as multiple compression due to lack of management credibility and seller overhang will impede any recovery. The question for holders is how much of a bounce will there be over what time frame to get out vs. bailing today?
Zendesk is down 22.28% to 92.50
Debt to equity ration is 255! Nooo thanks!Cap is way high too! Bag holders?
Will be back above 100 tomorrow.
"This market mistreated ZEN which reported solid bottom and top line numbers, but it got hammered for M/A. Any other firm's M/A often sends stock up 15% higher...odd!"
I guess probably full recovery today
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while ZEN barley does anything at all."
"USB price cut 2 days before earnings citing ""execution"", still target is close to 100% upside from here. Big selling comes in right before earnings. No secret many analyst aren't thrilled with management, but this seems a little overdone, if not orchestrated."
It will be close over $100 today
"Earnings beats, upside guidance.... why the heck is the drop then"
