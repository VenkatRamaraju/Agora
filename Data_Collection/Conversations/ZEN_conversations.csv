As a VP of the support team at a Saas company I can assure you ZD is the best tool. It’s the SF of support. And they charge accordingly. It may take awhile but this company has a great product that is pricey but makes it so you just can’t switch off of it. It’s a real winner for those reasons.

why is up?
Up nicely after hours.
Yahoo really messed up the message boards. No one here any more.
ridiculous stock based compensation for execs every quarter. almost 20% of revenues . almost 200 mil/yr. while not even turning a profit. unbelievable.Non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 in-line; GAAP EPS of -$0.50 misses by $0.11. do shareholders care why the difference ?mgmt obviously has no interest in company's future. just wants to fleece shareholders while they can and put money in their pockets
The company continues to incur loss. When can it make profit????
Why the pop on Friday? took a small position at 51.95 having sold out of CRM last week. I think Salesforce CEO is getting a little too vocal about social issues vs running his core business so made the choice to go with a company that seems more focused on their clients needs and core biz.
Zensational !!!

"Very impressive results, delighted I jumped in last month.. Had been on the sidelines just observing for months. This is going higher, in time it will be a takeover tgt but would like this to get well over $100 before those games ko. Not a bad return so far, just need to keep delivering."
shorts squeezed tomorrow.
Looking like a buy
This one is going to be a big winner . Give the market time to correct . Their growth is far ahead of Salesforce which expected about 3.5bps next year which is anemic . This stock will outperform the S&P easily

I bought Zendesk about 5/6 years ago when it IPO'ed and I had just started trading stocks. I didn't know anything about trading but went in head first after watching Google and Apple and markets in general go up for years. I think I paid about $15.00 a share at the time. I sold them about a year later for a small profit. I did the same with Google after it split. Today I want to shoot myself. Live and learn.
