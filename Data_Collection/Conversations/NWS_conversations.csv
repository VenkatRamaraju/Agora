"To the powers to be at Fox News and Fox Business......I have been a viewer since day one.You have fallen to the left....why??? I could always depend on fox to get the true story. You have changed. I could always go to CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, for the censored versions. Your coverage of the election was so disappointing to me and many others.I changed to OAN and NEWS MAX. I will say good bye to my Fox family at a later date."

No one should invest in this co. since it goes nowhere.
"Overall I think we will see upside for NWS in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? check out awesome-STOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
"11 years ago GE had an overfunded pension and then GE management went year after year neglecting its obligation to current employees and retirees. Now its an unfunded liability of north of $30 billion if reasonable assumptions are used (but hey, if we listen to Trian Partners its not that bad because you gotta think about after tax consequences). GE paid somewhere between $15-20 billion for Alstom and effectively wrote off the entire acquisition three years later. Over the past several years GE bought back one billion shares north of $30 a share. That trade has cost GE $22 billion. Boy how they need that money now.Why has the SEC been radio silent?????? They had no problem hammering Elon Musk with a few weeks of his tweet and shook him down for $80 million but GE management has operated in an insanely reckless manner for a decade."
"Fortune Magazine, like most publications, serves the world richest people. They say they are for the poor, the uneducated, and the hungry. yet they never question why the Fed always wants to kill prosperous economies. Listing malarkey like Greenspan misreading the affects of home ownership, and irrational exhuberance. These mean nothing. The Fed kills economies for 1 reason. So that the poor and the middle class have little or no wage growth. The only people that prosper from these lower wages is the world richest billionaires. And when workers are underpaid, they collect entitlements from the government. And the poor and middle class lose even more in higher taxes. The Wall Street journal, Fortune, the new York Times, all collude to mislead, and keep the people down. Why is that ? Why is there not a voice among them, that questions why the rich are allowed to profit by keeping the wages of billions low. Who thought the media was for the people ? WHy would anyone think that, given the press is owned by the rich. WHy do you invest in a company that helps keep the poor downtrodden, and helps make the rich even richer. Can you sleep at night knowing what your ownership is doing to people, and your own wages ?"

Any day now NWSA will unlock value in NWSA. Rea drake. IPO foxtel. Spinoff realtor.com. Break off the publishing unit. Any day now. All this mgmt does is take charge after charge quarter after quarter. This management team has zero credibility
Back to 12!! Woo hoo!! Similar quarter for nwsa to the past few quarters but at least the stock is up for a change. Surprisingly no one is pounding the drum to have them spin-off the real estate division and get the stock to double

Who in their right minds would invest in this trash stock. Had you invested in NYT in Jan/Feb 2017 you would enjoy 300%+ gains thanks to Carnival Barker Trump bashing and the stellar NYT reporting on his corruption. Long on NYT since Feb 2017. Keep bashing NYT !!!

where are the buybacks ? where is the dividend increase? NWSA has greatly benefitted from the aussie dollar strengthening as well as the performance of companies like SEEK and REA Group. When does the BOD address the chronic underperformance of the stock? Buying back stock under $13 is wildly accretive. its time the BOD starts thinking in terms of shareholders rather than what the Murdoch clan wants.

"Barrons has a story about a site for the opponent of Susan Collins crashing shortly after saying she would vote yes. What they didn't tell you is that it was all prearranged, with few, if anyone actually donating. I admire Susan for doing what the voters elected her to do. No doubt, she will get re-elected by a landslide. Phoney planted stories, about phoney events aren't convincing anyone to vote left. We should stop that. But we can't. Our ideas are terrible."

They will have retired a record number of shares thereby increasing EPS and saving $Billions in dividends, etc. The conference call will be fabulous. They will report increased sales in their catch all catergory (iWatch, iTunes, Beats, etc.). They will report growth in iPads and even computers. They will be conservative in their guidance going forward and based off of that the stock will tank. Could see 160 or even 159 before the bleeding stops. This will last 2 - 3 week before the ""positive"" stories come out and the stock will be north of 200 this time next year. This happens every year. Go look it up. Stock was 120 this time last year. Same thing happened. Now we are at 170. So when it happens do not say I did not warn you. There will be lots of crying on this board next week when it happens."

"Nwsa investment in Rea group and MOVE is worth more than the current market cap. What is wrong with this management team? How completely inept can they be to constantly take charges to earnings year in year out, quarter in quarter out? How long does it take to value this stupid investment in foxtel? They have been writing it down for years !!!!! This management team needs to go. They have no idea what they are doing. They continue to hold together a bunch of completely unrelated businesses and now they are boosting spending on foxtel. Why? To spend shareholder money now so that Rupert can buy the whole company in a year or two when Fox gets sold to Disney and the Murdochs have billions at their disposal?????"
"Reaction to Wall Street Journal Article: ""DACA Is Restored After Court Rules DHS Head Served Illegally""Another glaring example of judicial activism designed to thwart President Trump's ability to govern. President Obama created DACA by Executive Order lacking the ability to work with Congress. My understanding is that Executive Orders can be changed or cancelled by succeeding Administrations. That is until Donald Trump became President. Like many of his initiatives, lower court judges have obstructed the Executive Branch. It is high time for news organizations, including WSJ, do some soul searching. Will WSJ take bias out of its reporting or will it follow the path of most news media, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, NEWSY, Fox News and my local newspaper, The Chicago Tribune. These organizations purvey narratives that purport to contain facts. Frequently, they support conclusions the media arrived at. In what direction will WSJ go? Will WSJ demonstrate independence? Will WSJ express principled positions? As a US based worldwide news organization, will WSJ stand for America?"
