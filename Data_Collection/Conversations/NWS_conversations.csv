"Dear Tarini Parti: A first? How would you know? Do you have an in at a genetic testing lab? All of us are part “black,” nearly all are part Asian and European. My “white” wife is supposedly 19% Nigerian, and according to “geneticists” I’m part Hispanic, and my male ancestors had roots in the Indus Valley. So why is any of this relevant? Other to suggest that Kamala Harris over-achieved, given her genetic make-up? You and your editor should be ashamed."
Why the stock is not rallying? Can someone explain and why there’s so much Put bought?

"NWSA has made a boatload on its investments in REA, SEEK ASIA and realtor.com. when the heck does the company start buying back the stock ?!?!?!? how much of a discount to NAV do we need to see to get murdoch to do something about the #$%$ stock performance of the past few years ?"

Any day now NWSA will unlock value in NWSA. Rea drake. IPO foxtel. Spinoff realtor.com. Break off the publishing unit. Any day now. All this mgmt does is take charge after charge quarter after quarter. This management team has zero credibility
i think the stock will rise soon https://prwirepro.com/2019/02/16/news-corporation-nws-stock/
NWSA is down -5.04% to 14.49
"When does nwsa take steps to unlock value from foxtel and rea group? Now that nwsa owns 65% of foxtel and will begin consolidating it, it will be substantially easier to see what's under the hood at foxtel. Hopefully a tax free spinoff occurs as it's hard to see any synergies between foxtel and other nwsa businesses"

How is this company impacted by the Disney takeover of Fox?
"Fortune Magazine, like most publications, serves the world richest people. They say they are for the poor, the uneducated, and the hungry. yet they never question why the Fed always wants to kill prosperous economies. Listing malarkey like Greenspan misreading the affects of home ownership, and irrational exhuberance. These mean nothing. The Fed kills economies for 1 reason. So that the poor and the middle class have little or no wage growth. The only people that prosper from these lower wages is the world richest billionaires. And when workers are underpaid, they collect entitlements from the government. And the poor and middle class lose even more in higher taxes. The Wall Street journal, Fortune, the new York Times, all collude to mislead, and keep the people down. Why is that ? Why is there not a voice among them, that questions why the rich are allowed to profit by keeping the wages of billions low. Who thought the media was for the people ? WHy would anyone think that, given the press is owned by the rich. WHy do you invest in a company that helps keep the poor downtrodden, and helps make the rich even richer. Can you sleep at night knowing what your ownership is doing to people, and your own wages ?"

"Barrons has a story about a site for the opponent of Susan Collins crashing shortly after saying she would vote yes. What they didn't tell you is that it was all prearranged, with few, if anyone actually donating. I admire Susan for doing what the voters elected her to do. No doubt, she will get re-elected by a landslide. Phoney planted stories, about phoney events aren't convincing anyone to vote left. We should stop that. But we can't. Our ideas are terrible."
"If Zillow does $170 million in quarterly EBITDA and is worth $40 billion, what is NWSA digital real estate services quarterly EBITDA of $142 million worth ? $20 billion? How can management continue to sit on its hands? How long must I sing this song? Thanks bono"

"To the powers to be at Fox News and Fox Business......I have been a viewer since day one.You have fallen to the left....why??? I could always depend on fox to get the true story. You have changed. I could always go to CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, for the censored versions. Your coverage of the election was so disappointing to me and many others.I changed to OAN and NEWS MAX. I will say good bye to my Fox family at a later date."

I was looking at Investor's Business Daily but it's another News Corp. publication so I have to assume it's full of bias. Best publication to escape bias for investors?"

Who in their right minds would invest in this trash stock. Had you invested in NYT in Jan/Feb 2017 you would enjoy 300%+ gains thanks to Carnival Barker Trump bashing and the stellar NYT reporting on his corruption. Long on NYT since Feb 2017. Keep bashing NYT !!!

"11 years ago GE had an overfunded pension and then GE management went year after year neglecting its obligation to current employees and retirees. Now its an unfunded liability of north of $30 billion if reasonable assumptions are used (but hey, if we listen to Trian Partners its not that bad because you gotta think about after tax consequences). GE paid somewhere between $15-20 billion for Alstom and effectively wrote off the entire acquisition three years later. Over the past several years GE bought back one billion shares north of $30 a share. That trade has cost GE $22 billion. Boy how they need that money now.Why has the SEC been radio silent?????? They had no problem hammering Elon Musk with a few weeks of his tweet and shook him down for $80 million but GE management has operated in an insanely reckless manner for a decade."

"Barrons is putting out hourly stories about the market fearing a recession. Down 400 points ? Big deal. When its over bought, it goes down. Usually when someone says the sky is falling, they are serving the investment groups who have already sold, and want the market to go lower, so they can go back in. It happens all the time. Going up, and going down. Someone should look into why Barrons is all of a sudden saying the sky is falling. Its not. It might be slowing. but tis still growing. And faster than any of the 8 years under Obama."
No one should invest in this co. since it goes nowhere.

"Reaction to Wall Street Journal Article: ""DACA Is Restored After Court Rules DHS Head Served Illegally""Another glaring example of judicial activism designed to thwart President Trump's ability to govern. President Obama created DACA by Executive Order lacking the ability to work with Congress. My understanding is that Executive Orders can be changed or cancelled by succeeding Administrations. That is until Donald Trump became President. Like many of his initiatives, lower court judges have obstructed the Executive Branch. It is high time for news organizations, including WSJ, do some soul searching. Will WSJ take bias out of its reporting or will it follow the path of most news media, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, NEWSY, Fox News and my local newspaper, The Chicago Tribune. These organizations purvey narratives that purport to contain facts. Frequently, they support conclusions the media arrived at. In what direction will WSJ go? Will WSJ demonstrate independence? Will WSJ express principled positions? As a US based worldwide news organization, will WSJ stand for America?"

"I want to give a heads up to some of you who are new to Apple and maybe don't have a good understanding of how this stock trades and is manipulated via the analysts and the media.Next week Apple will again report that it has sold more iPhones than ever in the history of the company. The company will also report the largest sales and profits for one quarter by any company in the history of the world (?hyperbole). The will report growth of iPhones sales in China. They will have retired a record number of shares thereby increasing EPS and saving $Billions in dividends, etc. The conference call will be fabulous. They will report increased sales in their catch all catergory (iWatch, iTunes, Beats, etc.). They will report growth in iPads and even computers. They will be conservative in their guidance going forward and based off of that the stock will tank. Could see 160 or even 159 before the bleeding stops. This will last 2 - 3 week before the ""positive"" stories come out and the stock will be north of 200 this time next year. This happens every year. Go look it up. Stock was 120 this time last year. Same thing happened. Now we are at 170. So when it happens do not say I did not warn you. There will be lots of crying on this board next week when it happens."

"Nwsa investment in Rea group and MOVE is worth more than the current market cap. What is wrong with this management team? How completely inept can they be to constantly take charges to earnings year in year out, quarter in quarter out? How long does it take to value this stupid investment in foxtel? They have been writing it down for years !!!!! This management team needs to go. They have no idea what they are doing. They continue to hold together a bunch of completely unrelated businesses and now they are boosting spending on foxtel. Why? To spend shareholder money now so that Rupert can buy the whole company in a year or two when Fox gets sold to Disney and the Murdochs have billions at their disposal?????"

where are the buybacks ? where is the dividend increase? NWSA has greatly benefitted from the aussie dollar strengthening as well as the performance of companies like SEEK and REA Group. When does the BOD address the chronic underperformance of the stock? Buying back stock under $13 is wildly accretive. its time the BOD starts thinking in terms of shareholders rather than what the Murdoch clan wants.
