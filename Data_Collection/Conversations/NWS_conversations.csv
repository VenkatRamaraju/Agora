NWSA at 20. I may faint. Plenty of upside on this breakout to all time highs
REA group hit $125 per share in Australia. When does NWSA address the chronic underperformance. It’s been years of misery. Time for management to recognize this and distribute the REA investment to shareholders
REA group up to $140. NWSA dead money for years now. Feel like this mgmt needs to shake things. All these unrelated businesses make absolutely no sense as one company
One more day to see $12's tomorrow.
Really strong volume in NWSA the past few days. 3x to 4x the volume of a few months ago. Something up. Are the Murdoch’s going to buy NWSA once they are cash rich from the Sale of FOX?
Nice to see NWSA management acknowledge the fact the the stock is trading at a huge discount to its sum of the parts. Talk is cheap so it would be nice to see them do something about closing the gap
"Barrons is putting out hourly stories about the market fearing a recession. Down 400 points ? Big deal. When its over bought, it goes down. Usually when someone says the sky is falling, they are serving the investment groups who have already sold, and want the market to go lower, so they can go back in. It happens all the time. Going up, and going down. Someone should look into why Barrons is all of a sudden saying the sky is falling. Its not. It might be slowing. but tis still growing. And faster than any of the 8 years under Obama."
When does NWSA spin off the realtor.com REA group biz? Has to be worth $10b at this point
NWSA reached an all time high at 20.25
"Overall I think we will see upside for NWS in the short-term. Perhaps a pullback next day or so could occur I suppose but are yall also seeing a further leg higher? check out awesome-STOCKS, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."
"Is there a great investment publication NOT tied to News Corp, or any other biased publisher? I realized I need to cancel WSJ, I can't take the narrative any longer. Just looking for facts and focus. I cancelled Bloomberg a few months back, too, don't miss is at all. I was looking at Investor's Business Daily but it's another News Corp. publication so I have to assume it's full of bias. Best publication to escape bias for investors?"
Slowly going up.
Now NWSA gets an upgrade ?? At 26? I mean I’ll gladly take the upgrade but why not at 10?15?20?25?
What does NWSA plan to do with the $10 billion REA group investment ? Is it ever going to be spun off?
Any day now NWSA will unlock value in NWSA. Rea drake. IPO foxtel. Spinoff realtor.com. Break off the publishing unit. Any day now. All this mgmt does is take charge after charge quarter after quarter. This management team has zero credibility

"Reaction to Wall Street Journal Article: ""DACA Is Restored After Court Rules DHS Head Served Illegally""Another glaring example of judicial activism designed to thwart President Trump's ability to govern. President Obama created DACA by Executive Order lacking the ability to work with Congress. My understanding is that Executive Orders can be changed or cancelled by succeeding Administrations. That is until Donald Trump became President. Like many of his initiatives, lower court judges have obstructed the Executive Branch. It is high time for news organizations, including WSJ, do some soul searching. Will WSJ take bias out of its reporting or will it follow the path of most news media, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, NEWSY, Fox News and my local newspaper, The Chicago Tribune. These organizations purvey narratives that purport to contain facts. Frequently, they support conclusions the media arrived at. In what direction will WSJ go? Will WSJ demonstrate independence? Will WSJ express principled positions? As a US based worldwide news organization, will WSJ stand for America?"
NWS is up 5.00% to 16.27
"If Zillow does $170 million in quarterly EBITDA and is worth $40 billion, what is NWSA digital real estate services quarterly EBITDA of $142 million worth ? $20 billion? How can management continue to sit on its hands? How long must I sing this song? Thanks bono"
"To AOC regarding her Trump Accountability Project. “Remember what they did, vowing to “never forget” those who helped push the Trump agenda. ADD ME TO YOUR LIST!"
Will spinning off the digital real estate biz ever be considered by mgmt ?
Going under $2
The upside potential for NWS just got a whole lot more interesting. google awesomeS-TOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
The NY Post could gain lots of readership for its honest reporting ( a rarity these days) ---especially digging up thr dirt on the Biden family.
It will drop 50% in one day
"NWSA finally started buying back stock. They Bought 5mn shares in October,still have $429 million of buybacks remaining of the $500 million authorization. Finally! It's a start. NWSa going to start consolidating foxtel and its $2.5 billion of revenues. Up to now foxtel has been completely nonexistent on NWSa's income statement"
Sell before too late
"Almost Billion Share and loosing money, fair value $0.005"
How is this company impacted by the Disney takeover of Fox?
NWSA reached a new All Time High at 17.05
When does Murdoch take nwsa private. The rea stake worth $5.5b now. Realtor.com could be worth a few billion. Current stock price is assigning a negative value on the remaining very profitable businesses
"To the powers to be at Fox News and Fox Business......I have been a viewer since day one.You have fallen to the left....why??? I could always depend on fox to get the true story. You have changed. I could always go to CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, for the censored versions. Your coverage of the election was so disappointing to me and many others.I changed to OAN and NEWS MAX. I will say good bye to my Fox family at a later date."
