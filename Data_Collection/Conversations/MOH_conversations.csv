"Doesn't make a whole lot of sense why they would fire the Molina brothers as CEO/CFO but yet allow them to remain on Board? Molina family still owns anywhere 20-25% of the company but this recent management shuffle makes a takeover much more likely now. Given the operational and margin issues not sure what an aquirer would pay, but it's a good brand and ""cheapest"" of the Managed Care companies available now"

"From Dow Jones: Molina Healthcare Swings to Quarterly Profit, Forecasts Strong Annual Profit Growth4:28 PM ET 2/11/19 | Dow Jones4:02 PM ET 2/11/19MOHBy Maria Armental Molina Healthcare Inc. swung to a profit in the latest period and forecast strong profit growth this year, but the revenue forecast missed Wall Street targets. Overall, Molina reported a fourth-quarter profit of $201 million, or $3.01 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $262 million, or $4.59 a share, driven by impairment charges. This year, Molina forecasts profit of $9.25 to $9.75 a share on about $16.3 billion in revenue, compared with projections from analysts polled by FactSet of $9.02 a share on $17.15 billion in revenue.

"MOH has greatly exceeded its consensus analyst PT on Yahoo of.....""77.07/sh"" and thus should be sold or shorted....On the other hand, TXMD is significantly below its PT on Yahoo and has zero debt, $148M in cash, 2 best in class drugs with $2-$3B in peak revenue potential and forward estimates of (19) .08 (20) .53 on Nasdaq.In summary, based on current analyst estimates and current metrics, TXMD is significantly more undervalued than MOH"

"Price movement is not all about earnings, it's about forward guidance. All health insurers $ UNH, $ANTM, $MOH will issue lowered guidance for as long as both political parties keep the conversation up on lowering health care expenses and the Medicare-For-All proposed by Bernie Sanders and socialists. Note that I said ""socialist"" not ""democrat"" because democrats want Obamacare, socialist want Medicare-for-all. Unfortunately, the socialist ma have highjacked the Democratic Party and become their (loud) voice (Bernie, Alexandria O Cortez)."
Beat and raise and no action after hours?
Would someone try to explain to me why MOH has gone up when repeal of the individual mandate implies that fewer people will be able to afford health insurance and healthcare providers will have fewer patients that can afford high premiums for their medical care?

"Funny this quarter guidance is 16 bills revenue down from 17 bill revenue which is like 6% and the shares corrected 6% today but their EPS guidance is well north of 9.00 which is at least guidance. Hmm - buy here at 132 maybe? I don't know if United Health has anything to do with it. But Molina is a solid company. Unless there is a big miss on April 29, hey could go way up. That's only 17 days away. A beat will cause a huge runup if it's not already pricing in by then."
