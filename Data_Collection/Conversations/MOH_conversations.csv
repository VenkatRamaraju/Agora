"From Dow Jones: Molina Healthcare Swings to Quarterly Profit, Forecasts Strong Annual Profit Growth4:28 PM ET 2/11/19 | Dow Jones4:02 PM ET 2/11/19MOHBy Maria Armental Molina Healthcare Inc. swung to a profit in the latest period and forecast strong profit growth this year, but the revenue forecast missed Wall Street targets. Overall, Molina reported a fourth-quarter profit of $201 million, or $3.01 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $262 million, or $4.59 a share, driven by impairment charges. This year, Molina forecasts profit of $9.25 to $9.75 a share on about $16.3 billion in revenue, compared with projections from analysts polled by FactSet of $9.02 a share on $17.15 billion in revenue.

Democrats introducing bill for Universal Healthcare For All. Unaffordable and will never pass. The president will veto if it does pass. Consider this a buying op.
MOH is up 5.95% to $151.64
Socialism is better than capitalism. Looks like we need to learn from China.
It will cut in half tomorrow when they publish news at 1:00PM today?

All health insurers will lower their forward guidance as long as politicians keep the conversation up on lowering health care expenses
I have no info just watching the trades.. I bought after hearing an analyst report that MOH would be bought out soon.. this was 5 or so weeks ago.. then I see a big trade AH and me thinks coming soon.. I added.. good luck
I assume this is the Amazon effect:https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/amazons-moves-into-health-what-we-know.html
Molina Healthcare reached an all time high at 296.62
"10% drop in 2days UNH, brutal. 22% drop since Oct 2018 high while the indices have recovered and reached all time high. That's how much health insurers UNH has lagged the market. $MOH, $ANTM"
This dip should be bought growth model is in tact and strong growth is ahead.
What is going on. Any news?
"Price movement is not all about earnings, it's about forward guidance. All health insurers $ UNH, $ANTM, $MOH will issue lowered guidance for as long as both political parties keep the conversation up on lowering health care expenses and the Medicare-For-All proposed by Bernie Sanders and socialists. Note that I said ""socialist"" not ""democrat"" because democrats want Obamacare, socialist want Medicare-for-all. Unfortunately, the socialist ma have highjacked the Democratic Party and become their (loud) voice (Bernie, Alexandria O Cortez)."
"Liberal Dem healthcare or not, someone has to pay for it, and if there's a program paying, then that's when the stocks should stay solid."
"Funny this quarter guidance is 16 bills revenue down from 17 bill revenue which is like 6% and the shares corrected 6% today but their EPS guidance is well north of 9.00 which is at least guidance. Hmm - buy here at 132 maybe? I don't know if United Health has anything to do with it. But Molina is a solid company. Unless there is a big miss on April 29, hey could go way up. That's only 17 days away. A beat will cause a huge runup if it's not already pricing in by then."
I see 124-125 close on ruling challanges.
its really sounds good!! I guess it'll touch the highest peak soon..
NIce move!
Closing under $80 with this news today
"Doesn't make a whole lot of sense why they would fire the Molina brothers as CEO/CFO but yet allow them to remain on Board? Molina family still owns anywhere 20-25% of the company but this recent management shuffle makes a takeover much more likely now. Given the operational and margin issues not sure what an aquirer would pay, but it's a good brand and ""cheapest"" of the Managed Care companies available now"
Beat and raise and no action after hours?
MOH is up 6.21% to 90.18
Would someone try to explain to me why MOH has gone up when repeal of the individual mandate implies that fewer people will be able to afford health insurance and healthcare providers will have fewer patients that can afford high premiums for their medical care?
"this company is just window dressing. they will sell in the near future, internally they are a mess...let someone else deal with it"
