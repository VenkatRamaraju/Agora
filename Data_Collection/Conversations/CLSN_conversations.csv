When more news comes out on GEN 1 its gonna fly high just keep loading up with any extra cash you have
Sleeping giant
"I have not been a fan of this company for YEARS, but this is something new; A completely new drug delivery platform that seems to hold all of the promise ""Thermodox"" failed at so miserably. Congratulations to the new management that seems to have hit the nail on the head with what may eventually replace surgury as the preferred method for dealing with a variety of cancers. By specifically pinpointing the use of interluken to tissues with a specific DNA fingerprint, more of the surrounding tissue can be spared damage with better results than ever before. As with any clinical trial in phase 2, there can be large amounts of risk, but as far as I'm concerned, this company hasn't seen a future quite this rosey in well over 5 years, perhaps 10."
Brian are you going to short it again? You may be able to afford a couple more happy meals with your earnings.
"As a long time shareholder,even a headquarters visitor when located in Columbia Md., this is the end of an era.Such promise in Thermodox left unfulfilled. Most of my shares are long gone.I have several thousand remaining at this stage more out of sentimentality than hope in the science."
"Great close above the 50MA, great stealth accumulation, not to much noise, lets keep it like that till we break the 200 MA at $ 1,51 then print a new high above $ 2.42 then we get the good news around July and we open with a big gap around $6 to $8.Low float, Low market cap,they have the cash, bottom is set, great potential, 2020 is the year for this company.""Celsion looks forward with laser focus to the balance of 2020, a year that we have every reason to believe will be transformational for patients, the medical community and for our investors.""July 2020 It is now or never!May God Bless you all and keep you healthy and be able to see Celsion succeed and be of help to patients."
"The price in short term is in somewhat shallow waters. This is not a day trade. One can make money in short term with this stock, but it is more depentant on luck.But, kindly be aware, if this company realises its full capacity in terms of its projected product portfolio, it will (in street slang) ""go through the roof"".I predict:1) Each successfully ended study with a compliant product: $10-$20 per share each2) Each successful partnership agreement: $10-$20 per share eachSo, for an example, let's say CLSN completes one study with a finised product (reference hint: FDA fast track) and partners with one other company, the stock would be in range of $20-$40 per share. But, in the other hand, as the time goes on and nothing is released, the stock would be in the mercy of general market dynamics and short sellers.The verdict:CLSN is a (massive) bet. One either belives in it and potentially reaps some unreal gains from it or one just waits and watches as the price per share swings between $1-$3."
Later this month we should get the phase one 100mg results. We have been told this dose is safe....but will it continue the 90-100% ORR and interval debulking R0 rate? And will there be additional indications of even greater improvements in the immune system attack on both the primary and metastatic tumours? And what type of accelerated approval might be granted? Will phase two be considered pivotal? Gen-1 sales could be in the multi-billion range. Will it be partnered? Or bought outright? The data so far has been outstanding. IMO it is bigger deal than Thermodo!
"Based on press release today, we should have our answer by July 15th at the latest. I cant really explain the lack of interest, but its created an amazing investing opportunity. I still believe this could go to $50 if the data is unequivocal"
"Try to make it and keep it simple and manage your risk/reward tolerability. Here is simple dd to add to your own.We are only a 50 million market cap!!! and Phase III OPTIMA Study on Track for Interim Data Analysis in July. Billion dollar market potential.That is itSo how much you think we can run before that data is reveal, From here, I think minimum 100%Blessings"
Lets see a nice 10% run up today
any bets on where this will end the week.... I'm goin $0.94...
To be clear there will be no FDA approval in July. The DMC is deciding whether or not they stop the Optima trial for efficacy. then they will seek FDA approval which will take another 9 months because they are fast tracked. I am very long CLSN and been for three years and think we have a great chance at Optima stoppage and a run to over $10. Then some ups and downs on our way to FDA approval. The ups and downs could include some dilution or a partnership or BO from a BP. That could take us to a $300MM to $500MM valuation.
"So there was one thing missing to accelerate our uptrend and now we have it.Great SA article to bring awareness of the company........checkCash to bring us into catalysts in July 2020.......checkLow float, Low market cap........checkPotential Products in Billion dollar market.......checkTechnicals resistance clear 50MA and 200MA taken.......check"
Why would they do an offering in this market that has all of biotech already beaten down? What happened to having enough cash till 2023. I believe in this company but this one is a real head scratcher. I had several chances to sell with huge 6 figure gains and i waited I guess i should not have.
Great article on CLSN from SA. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4348863-celsion-big-gains-possible-in-july
not what I needed to hear. Insiders no skin in the game still. No change in trials. Not looking at tumor size. no results from quick scan of data. nobody else to blame no comment on life extension of patients.
"This stock is sleeping right now, won't do anything for over a year 4rm now when they start getting results 4rm their findings 4rn their patients"
I added today. I couldn't get my $2 price the last 2 weeks so I just bought a few today on an oversold condition. I was going to post today that its about time for an insider to buy some more shares and then I noticed Martinez bought some. Ha. good omen.
"We know that THERMODOX works, Now, can it be statically measured with only 550 test patients. We know it could not be properly measured with 138 or so.Charts is amazingly good and liver cancer patients do need this protocol.79 months versus 53 months survival is huge. we should know very very soon. Maybe now that the COVID vaccine soon no longer needed, some $ can go to liver treatment too."
"Good news but getting no love. This company has 64.5 million in cash as of the last quarter, enough to fund operations through 2024 per company’s pr, so likely they won’t need to issue any offerings in the near future."
ok...bought 1000 shares at $1.10.....stop loss at $0.99.....I know....Big deal.....
"If we receive good news in the July phase 3 update, how high do you guys think the stock could rise?"
"with the huge call option volume strike 2,50$ CLSN will go to min 3$ today and may breakout to 4$ next two days chart are looking really good ..... we fly soon"
if this would ever get back to $1.10... I could short a few thousand shares and go get some king crab legs....
"With over 35% short percentage, it is perfect candidate for Reddit action."
"While we nit-pick statistical result 0.900 versus 0.903, potentially many liver cancer patients could have had extended life by 17/20 months.Even if not as efficient as desired, just THERMODOX principle of extra percent of potent drug entering the cancer area is worth doing.. Did OPTIMA study shows any nasty side effects, if not, why not proceed further already now ?"
"LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Jan. 28, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN), a clinical stage biotechnology company, in response to the long-term threat of coronaviruses and other potential pandemic causing infectious agents, today announced the filing of a provisional U.S. patent application for a novel DNA-based, investigational vaccine for preventing or treating infections from a broad range of infectious agents including the coronavirus disease using its PLACCINE DNA vaccine technology platform. The provisional patent covers a family of novel composition of multi-cistronic vectors and polymeric nanoparticles that comprise the PLACCINE DNA vaccine platform technology for preventing or treating infectious agents that have the potential for global pandemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations, using the Company’s platform technology. PLACCINE is a natural extension of the Company’s synthetic, non-viral TheraPlas delivery technology currently in a Phase II trial for the treatment of late-stage ovarian cancer with GEN-1, Celsion’s DNA-mediated IL-12 immunotherapy."
I'm surprised this stock isn't over 5 already.
"As the CEO just mentioned on their quarterly call, the medical community understands the significance of what CLSN is accomplishing in their trials, but the wall street community doesn't, YET...He then intimated, they will soon...Get in before they do!"
like I have posted here earlier that was deleted? T-cells are the deal and the TERMINATOR of this vicious covid Virus and their durability is beyond question.The quiet Elite group body defense that are ready to kill once activited
"FDA granted fast track designation back in February. Meanwhile, their own clinical outreach program states they won't even be done with Ovation 2 until 2024 because they need more data and participants. The pr's on this company is nothing more that recycled information. Question is, who keeps sustaining their business operations without any significant breakthroughs in the last 40 years and why?"
"Can anybody please explain, how is it that the volume is rather low(ish), but the price keeps moving steadily upwards? In technical terms."
FDA fast track is a real achievement for Celsion. I am surprised the stock price isn't higher.
"this financing extends our operating cash runway well into 2021. We believe we will have cash comfortably beyond the final data readout of the OPTIMA Study (anticipated for the first quarter of 2021), if needed. While clinical success likely would allow an equity raise at a higher valuation, given the potential for continued stock market volatility we determined that the best course of action was to strengthen our balance sheet now, and with quality investors.""Guess the stock price rise was too hard for them to ignore"
(NLSP) MCap $32 m--2x Blockbusters in late stage with imminent data readout and partnership = 1000% UPSIDEEE
"After reading the letter to shareholders, I don't understand the enthusiasm. The Optima trial is done, and everything else is ""maybe."" I originally bought into this company over 20 years ago, and have been in and out since. (A share of CLSN in Feb 2020 was worth over $7,000, after adjusting for all the dilutions.) What I've seen over and over is promise followed by disappointment. As far as I know (I could be wrong), they've never gotten a product to market. And even if their current pipeline pays off, it will be at least a couple of years down the road, it seems. I'm not trying to bash, just trying to understand."
"############################################################################ThermoDox: 2nd Interim Efficacy Analysis of global pivotal PIII trial just weeks away: 2Q 2020, high probability of success############################################################################From CLSN statement: ""....The iDMC’s pre-planned interim efficacy review followed 128 patient events, or deaths, which occurred in August 2019. Data presented demonstrated that progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) data appear to be tracking with patient data observed at a similar point in the Company’s 285 patient, well-balanced subgroup of patients followed prospectively in the earlier Phase III study (the “Prospective Subgroup”) upon which the OPTIMA Study is based. This Prospective Subgroup demonstrated a 2-year overall survival advantage and a median time to death of more than 7 ½ years. ...""MOST IMPORTANT: ""......From the data review, the Company believes that the OPTIMA Study is well positioned for success at the next pre-planned interim efficacy analysis, which is intended after a minimum of 158 patient deaths and is projected to occur during the second quarter of 2020. The hazard ratio for success at 158 events is 0.70. This is below the hazard ratio of 0.65 observed for the 285 patients in the HEAT Study Prospective Subgroup treated with RFA > 45 minutes.....""The bar is indeed set low in order to achieve success and to terminate the phase III trial early due to proved efficacy in 2Q 2020. Why? The bar for success is defined with a hazard ratio 0.70, this means a 30% improvement compared to control arm treatment. In the comparable subgroup of the HEAT study the observed hazard ratio was 0.65, this means a 35% improvement of the ThermoDox group compared with the control group was achieved. Therefore the bar NOW is lower and we have some room for trial result variability in both treatment arms (control group vs. ThermoDox group). Nothing is sure, but we will know it very soon down the road."
"From the latest 10Q the company states this, ""With the $2.7 million in cash and investments on hand at September 30, 2017 combined with the gross proceeds of $23.6 million provided by the exercise of warrants and the equity offering in October 2017 (Note 16), the Company believes it has sufficient capital resources to fund its operations well into the second quarter of 2019. """
Up we go!
"The reason it's exploding is because some preliminary clinical trial results for ThermoDox have been released on clinicaltrials dot gov that shows infusion of ThermoDox allows terminal liver cancer patients at the most advanced stages to live three more months than baseline, from 16.6 months baseline to 19.3 months with the use of ThermoDox: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT00617981 When ThermodDox (which is already successfully used in foreign medicine) gets approval, this stock will probably see somewhere in the $20-per-share range, and become a target for acquisition by a companies like Gilead, for example. Consider $2 to $3 a share as a gift from above... it's the low end. If Celsion just terminated a HUGE pending stock sale today it means they NO LONGER NEED THE MONEY, which means they have already been shopped by a parent acquisition company for the purpose of merge and/or major investment in the treatments they are investihating. Good luck to all!"
For those interested in the Gen-1 science....have a look at Dr. Thacker's presentation. Subsequently the 100mg dose has proven safe...and it should be noted that in phase 2 there will be 17 infusions of Gen-1... up from the 8 in phase one. Clearly higher doses have increased efficacy. http://investor.celsion.com/static-files/0e34e179-d5c4-4676-87bd-bd96e3e22bfe
"""FDA recommended an in-person meeting to discuss future trial designs potentially to accelerate clinical development."" And they are""very excited"".You can not ignore the magnitude of this statement. Its huge. Once the potency is confirmed, CLSN will be on fire if not before the data. I am pretty sure some FDA peeps will leak their information to some funds and Big Pharma initially as well. Once the PPS is over $5 then some funds will be able to load up. And as I stated some time ago when others sold due to the slow trials, once the trial starts in earnest, patients will be fighting to get in. I just feel bad that half of the patients will not get Gen-1. I still feel the FDA will stop the Gen-1, 2 or 3 trial early at some point due to strong efficacy. The word is getting out now but the pps will explode with Optima and/or Gen-1, phase 2 data. I think the PPS will move from here in to the fall. Im still buying on dips. GLTA"
shoulda shorted...
"Unfortunately, it happened. Friend of mine just passed away from liver cancer, Not totally sure which one but for sure, he would have very much enjoyed living another 15-20 months longer. Lets get EUA applied for/passed for THERMODOX and see what happens, No one has been able/willing to tell me what terrible side effects there is warranting all these delays. Enough is enough and .003 statistical difference is no reason to deprive liver cancer patients of this extra living time."
Strong close with heavy volume at end of day
"This market is tough. I have a basket of 25 stocks that I follow. Only 3 are green today....and CLSN is of them. I like that 4 NEW institutions have bought in. They did their dd at a deeper level than any of us little retail traders can do. They knew that there will be Gen-1 news in two or three weeks, and Thermodox news in two or three months. I wish I knew what they know! Gltal."
Lets all hope for the sake of liver cancer patients that phase 3 goes well to help them out and extend their lives.

"Breakthru coming.Once the dose is established in our randomized OVATION II study, FDA recommended an in-person meeting to discuss future trial designs potentially to accelerate clinical development. They also asked to redevelop supportive randomized data from a small subset of the OVATION II study and submit it with our Phase I data for breakthrough consideration if we so choose. IL-12 is the pro-immune activity, holy grail others could not harness due to its half life. CLSN will be using more DNA-GMP batch of plasmid in this trial than all other DNA trials combined. A 60 Mil market cap? Just unreal. CLSN will have a lot of eyes watching the next year and a half. It will jump to a 175 mil market cap at some point. GLTA"

Who bought this I don’t see anybody talking about this stock it’s been on the 1 for over 6 months and still don’t have approval just like years ago when it went to 6 dollars then back down to cents
"LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., March 03, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celsion Corporation (CLSN), a leading oncology drug development company, announces that Michael H. Tardugno, the company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, issued the following letter to stockholders.To My Fellow Stockholders:With the closing of a small equity fundraise today, Celsion has accomplished several important, positive objectives.First, we now count among our stockholders four institutional investors that have been following our progress with ThermoDox over a sufficiently long period of time to fully understand our technology and the potential for success of our global Phase III OPTIMA Study in primary liver cancer, or HCC. As we have said, positive trial results will be transformational – for patients with HCC, for physicians, for our employees and for you, our stockholders. I believe these new investors recognize they are financing a drug development program that holds the promise to make a measurable difference for the global medical community.Second, this small, relatively non-dilutive financing provides the Company with additional certainty in a highly volatile financial market. Given the extraordinary reaction by the stock markets to the COVID-19 coronavirus, we felt compelled to strengthen our balance sheet to buffer against the potential for a continued erosion in our equity valuation, while we complete the OPTIMA Study.Third, while we do not expect any interruption in our supply of ThermoDox or GEN-1 from our high-quality manufacturing partners in China, with this new capital we are better positioned to access our redundant U.S. and European suppliers. We have worked with these Western suppliers for years and are confident they are capable of supporting our clinical research and commercial requirements for ThermoDox, as well as our clinical supply requirements for GEN-1. They do so, however, at a higher price. If needed, the added capital provides further assurance that we will be able to access our back-up supply chain.Fourth, this financing extends our operating cash runway well into 2021. We believe we will have cash comfortably beyond the final data readout of the OPTIMA Study (anticipated for the first quarter of 2021), if needed. While clinical success likely would allow an equity raise at a higher valuation, given the potential for continued stock market volatility we determined that the best course of action was to strengthen our balance sheet now, and with quality investors.Our fundamentals remain strong. We reaffirm expectations to report data from the second pre-planned interim efficacy analysis for the Phase III OPTIMA Study in the second quarter of 2020. Enrollment in this trial was completed in August 2018, and given our primary endpoint of survival, we do not expect any major disruptions in patient follow-up or data reporting owing to COVID-19. In addition, early Phase I data from the OVATION 2 Study is expected by the end of the current quarter. Our supply chains are robust. Commercial interest in ThermoDox is high and increasing.In summary, we look forward to our future with optimism. On behalf of my colleagues at Celsion and our board of directors, I thank you for your continued support."
"The FDA has ""Fast Tracked"" Celsion's ""GEN-1"" DNA targeted treatment for ovarian cancer that showed 80% remission rates in patients in Phase II. The FDA will need to make a decision within 8 weeks of the designation whether or not to take this into hospitals for treatment of cancer sufferers, and the Fast Track was awarded about three weeks ago, meaning THE FDA WILL HAVE TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT BEFORE THE END OF AUGUST. With an 80% remission rate, I know what I feel that decision will be. After that happens, this stock is going to absolutely EXPLODE. We could be looking at $50-$100 per share. Get in now, BUY, and HOLD until at least June."
Funds positioning in Long. Time to accumulate again. $4+ soon enough imho
You’re the best CLSN
see.... it'll end below $1.10 by end of trading....gonna short more....
Positive energy on this board opposed to other yahoo forums! Long
getting ready to short a few shares at $1.10....easy peazy japanesy....
"Now that biotech sector is sprouting green shoots, small cap names like these will start climbing quickly. Now is the time to jump aboard."
"Hey $ATOS People , $CLSN is about to be the next big runner in ovarian cancer. PHASE II ALMOST COMPLETE. Get it now !"
Sorry Brian there goes all your gains shorting
Saw this youtube about astrazineca releasing preclinical trial data on a remarkably similar vaccine as celsion. Possible partner?
"BIG NEWS FASE 3, STRONG BUYCelsion Co-Sponsors Hepatocellular Carcinoma Symposium At The International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA) Annual ConferenceGlobeNewswire - Mon Sep 23, 7:02AM CDTCelsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN), an oncology drug-development company, announces it co-sponsored a symposium focused on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the recent 13 Annual Conference of the International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA). Other sponsors included Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Exelixis, Inc., both of whom provide therapeutics for the treatment of advanced HCC. The program, titled ""Master Class & Tumor Board: Composing Personalized HCC Treatment Strategies, Insights on Harmonizing Patient Care with a Multidisciplinary Ensemble,"" was held on September 20 in Chicago, and featured four speakers. The symposium's timing verges on the upcoming meeting of the Data Monitoring Committee's review of the first interim data for the Company's Phase III OPTIMA Study of its lead drug candidate, ThermoDox, to treat HCC."
"During brief conversation, IR confirmed that so far, not expecting data/comment delays to and from iDMC. But no specific date selected yet, other than still expectation for July."
Would be nice seeing this at $3.00 again
how do ya like my short bet now.....2000 shares at $1.09.....
this stock remains massively undervalued if Phase III is successful. No brainer risk/reward
"I am very surprised at how far this has fallen since the interim analysis, which in my opinion changed very little in terms of study confidence of thermodox. I think there is a lot of confusion about the role of an interim analysis and how it should be conducted. Mantaining blinding in the trial is critical for study integrity, therefore if the company chose to unblind the data at the interim analysis they take a “statistical hit” as a sort of price. This means that the bar to reach statistical significance at a late date is higher. Therefore, knowing the bar was high for success AND the pooled results were tracking in line with their estimates it makes complete sense that the decision was taken not to unblind the data and sacrifice some of their alpha. I do not think there is anything suspect about that. I continue to have faith that this trial will be able to show success and I hope that the conference call clears up some of the questions that many ppl have about the clinical trial"
The company expects to announce its plans for the OPTIMA study before year end so we expects press releases tomorrow or on the weekend if good news the stock will soar or if not good the stock will tumbles
decided to get back in
Blessings
I saw 3.75 premarket and now 2.3 i am very disappointed and regret bcz didn't sell and decide to stay long
"I came back to look at Celsion after taking a loss in it several years back (and I have learned my lessons) I am excited that Celsion received Fast Track Designation for the IL-12 therapy for Ovarian Cancer, but that is only a first step. What I would like to see before I invest again...and I will later tell you where I am invested in Oncology.- Published Data in a peer reviewed paper...no one seems to post links here. (I read the results from the Shareholder Letter, and it peeks my interest, but how many times have we been fooled... The bright side of things is that few people follow oncology stocks right now with the focus still on COVID. You have time to make better decisions as a retail investor, at least for the moment.)- More cash and more funded trials. (Looks like CLSN is still trying to understand what it has. Today’s announcement of selling 2MM in loss credits is a red flag to me. Not that they sold it which is good...but the fact that they had it in the first place.)- Reverse split (73MM shares outstanding?). Drop this down to 30MM with a higher stock price and institutions will consider CLSN- Interim data on the Phase 2 trial...is this on track to repeat Phase 1 or not?- Focus...vaccine company, cancer company, drug delivery company? What is Celsion? As Promised: Other companies: Turning Point Therapeutics (TPTX). Blueprint Medicine (BPMC), Bellicum (BLCM), Genprex (GNPX), and Cardiff Oncology (CRDF). You can do you own DD. The most bang for your dollar is likely to come from the last 3. I also did the same basic discovery on each of these that I am doing on Celsion.Market: Lower Highs everyday...I would wait before taking positions on anything for a few days or weeks."
THERMODOX science makes sense and earlier phase II results came out very nicely. Liver cancer patients need a breakMaybe not worth huge multi $ millions but at this level but definitively worth supporting & some investments.
"Why am I here ?THERMODOX Technology increases amount of drugs 25 folds into tumor and increase patient life by 2 years.Even if extremely strict statistical results show 50/50 chance to be right or wrong Unless terrible side effects, why stop ?Especially when additional data coming up soon that most likely will improve statistical valuation."
"I just returned from a holiday in Mexico to find that, as usual, the market failed to understand the positive nature of the GEN-1 dosing at 100 mg/m2.Safety cannot be taken for granted at this higher dose. GEN-1 is known to be more effective at this higher dose...and so far the safety is stellar. It is exciting to await the fuller efficacy and safety data sometime this quarter.I have had several friends die of ovarian cancer...they all had some initial success in treatment only to have the cancer come roaring back! GEN-1 holds the potential of working with the patients own immune system to create an army of memory T cells which will attack the attempt of the cancer to re-occur. May it be so! We shall learn more soon."
CELSION CORPORATION ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF $35 MILLION REGISTERED DIRECT OFFERING
They should just send delisting notice now
Tell me if I'm wrong but Phase 3 for ThermoDox will be finished in the first quarter coming up and it does look pretty good to help Liver cancer patients. If it does get approved your down side in this stock is $1.60 but your upside could be 4 to 7 dollars. maybe that is why some Funds are adding now since its coming up soon. Its like buying an option in some other stock. And I do hope it does gets approved especially for liver cancer patients.
on their website they say ThermoDox is currently being evaluated in a phase3 study for treatment of primary liver cancer still hoping for FDA approval ?
Ok does anyone have a technical reason WHY this is tanking?? Or better yet just a real reason WHY??
ok..thumbs up I keep my short position....thumbs down I close....
"Celsion Reports Data Safety Monitoring Board Recommendation to Proceed to Phase II of the OVATION 2 Study in Advanced Ovarian CancerBY GlobeNewswire— 8:30 AM ET 05/29/2020 Excellent Surgical Response Noted at the Higher, 100 mg/m2 Dose Novel Gene-Mediated Immunotherapy is Safe and Demonstrates an AcceptableRisk/Benefit When Administered Over a Six-Month Period, Up to 17 Doses"
what to expect Extend the phase 3 read out to include 50 or more additiional (beyond current stop for second interim look & then third interim higher extended events) to reduce uncertainty and/or simply mine the existing data for events (outiers or reporting errors intentional or otherwise) Couple this with what we all want to see direct purchases by all insiders and the stock rockets even without cfda or gen-1 news. Just say in the interest of reducing expenses the trial periods did not provide enough time for k-m seperation. If i see this I'll have no doubts about managrment. One necessary assumption - the drug is shown to extend life around 18 months.
Only 15 more trading days this month. There are at least two Big events to look forward to. The first is the release of the high dose Gen-1 phase one data. The second event is the Q4 conference call. On this call they can give a lot more information about Gen-1...and answer questions asked by analysts. I find the analysts ask the questions that I would ask....it should be very informative! I look forward to both events.
"@joeblo. I’m responding to your post .its important to understand the difference between the HEAT trial and the current OPtIMA trial. In the heat trial it was the subset of patients response that triggered the excitement :FDA response, and current trial. Only @40 % of those treated ,285 of the 701 patients were treated with a 45 minute duration which is the time needed for success. This trial all are being treated with the longer duration, Very importantly the primary end point of the HEAT trial was 30% PFS as opposed to the OS (overall survival) which is the current primary end point.If this trial mimics the response of the subset of the HEAT trial the company will have an approvable product..."

This is a dead cat
"This is why Celsion (CLSN) went up today:In late January, Celsion had also announced the filing of a provisional U.S. patent application for a novel DNA-based investigational vaccine for preventing or treating infections from a broad range of infectious agents including the coronavirus disease using its PLACCINE DNA vaccine technology platform. This provisional patent covers a family of novel composition of multi-cistronic vectors and polymeric nanoparticles that comprise the PLACCINE DNA vaccine platform technology for preventing or treating infectious agents that have the potential for global pandemics, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations using the company’s platform technology. And investors are speculating that Celsion is going to partner with a vaccine maker. Good Luck"
"ok, so, price looks pretty stabil here.....thinking it's time to short 2000 shares...."
"I would hesitate to call it a ponzi scheme, but that is pretty much what is was. I essentially gambled on it in 2013 and made the mistake of listening to the pumpers on this board and held. Make no mistake it was the same as going to Vegas or Biloxi. I was simply gambling on what sounded like a technology with alot of potential that I hope would help somebody. I still don't know to this day from reading the various conflicting information if the technology had any real use to help anyone. It seems to me even if the product was no better than regular chemo if it could reduce the amount of chemo needed therefore reducing the side effects it would have some value."
"Data Maturity issue? I've been considering how they ended up with 26 consecutive events from the treatment arm. If T'dox has no effect, either positive or negative, on treatment outcome we could treat these events as outcomes from consecutive flips of a fair coin, considering an event from the treatment arm as a ""heads"" and an event from the control arm as a ""tails. There are some caveats to this however. Unlike flips of a coin, the outcomes from either group reduces the possible number, and thus the odds, for another outcome from that group. when flipping a coin a ""heads"" result doesn't reduce the possible number of future ""heads"". Also, the population of treatment arm patients would have been greater at the beginning of the 26 event run. As the run of 26drew near the end, the numbers of patients in each arm would have been more nearly but not exactly equal. The p values indicate the degree of this inequality. I don't care enough to try to find the exact number in each arm and do the more complex calculation taking into account the steadily reducing number in treatment arm as the 26 consecutive events played out. However, calculating the odds for 26 consecutive identical results, when only 2 results are equally possible I come up with a 1 in 68,108,864. If you skew the probabilities to account for the unequal numbers in each arm and assign a 55% chance of an event from the treatment arm at each event, the odds become 1 in 5,630,800. Remember, this is assuming that T'dox has no positive value. I believe that something other than data immaturity is at work here."

Today’s news validated my $10 pt for CLSN. Watch why here . https://youtu.be/hOMOMh1-7ZQ
Not bad $3.75 if funds and private investors are buying in up here when the stock was a $1 not to long ago. Maybe they see something and clsn has some good cash now. This is a private placement and not out to the open market.
"It is too bad the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the market...but the next few months are very important for CLSN. There's the Gen-1 results in about a month...and the liver trial results a few months later. We know there have been partnership discussions concerning the liver indication...but if the 100% Objective Response Rate(ORR) continues in ovarian cancer...partnership discussions about that indication should be expected. Could some Big Pharma want to partner both? Or is a buyout in the cards? I can see management strengthening their cash position to strengthen their bargaining position. And the share count now is still only 35.5 million fully diluted. For a company with two(2) potential blockbuster drugs, that is a very small number."
"figures..... I buy at $1.10, and it immediately drops to $1.07...."
"whaaat, covid vaccine, effective, trials, boom my minions"
What is the possibility of buyout?
CLSN =Market Cap $88 Million -Potential Blockbuster with P3 interim data in July or August = If successful stock could rund toward $1 Billion valuation or around $35 per share . Could run to $7-9 ahead of the data .http://investor.celsion.com/static-files/70e45734-e80b-41dd-b6af-e19f435f46c0
"Because data reading of OPTIMA study with approx. only 1/3 of the patients studied came out with 0.524 P-value, Outside consultant refused to stick their necks out and refused to take a stand, even with some 1.5 years life increase. Believing that negative statistical value resulted from limited patient counts, Rightly, management decided to finalize 550 patient OPTIMA study and provide final read at that time as all earlier studies showed some 33% improvement in OS. It would not be the first time that early study read out comes out deficient which is corrected when full study read out is made available.Line is at 0.900 and early mid level study came out at 0.903, Not much of a miss when just a couple patients data would turn things completely around.We need to remember that we are dealing with terrible cancer and patients study is done with terribly sick, dying patients that are strongly subject to unrelated bacteria, virus etc... THERMODOX makes sense and will be proven efficient and FDA worthy."
"I am back in with 90,000 shares this is a no brainer with this news I expect a double on this within the next week or so LETS GO BOYS THE BULLS OF CLSN ARE BACK"
"I am staying in this stock long, this stock has great potential, and I am not an analyst, just an average Joe. Who’s with me?"
"Just about everyone has given up on CLSN.Looking back at the share price, when the HEAT study failure was announced, the SP dropped about 85% from over 500 to about 75. It's since dropped another 98% to less than 1.5. Seems to me that a big reason for CLSN's tiny market cap is that a lot of people have lost a bunch of money on the stock, and they have such painful memories that they no longer have any appetite for this one. I know when I've sold shares at a loss, I don't like thinking about that company any more, because of the painful memories. That's why I think CLSN may be severely undervalued - so many individual investors have lost money on this one over the years, and are no longer interested, and the MC has fallen so far that no institutions are interested. Even a company like Northwest Biotherapeutics (NWBO), which is absolutely despised, has a MC several times that of CLSN's. The success of the OPTIMA trial is by no means a slam dunk, but if the COS is only 25%, the odds on this one look favorable.If OPTIMA does succeed, the SP should be at least a 10 bagger from here, and possibly much more."
"Hello, I've just joined the extremely slow, and long term, yet very beneficial ride(IMO) that is CLSN. I hope they make the break through needed for this horrible disease. I've been watching since January, finally had the opportunity to invest this morning. Shorts, don't yell at me Bro!"
Great news out about Gen-1 advancing to next phase!
"What's NEW that we learn from todays CEO letter?1. Cashed up ""well into 2021"".2. 4 ""new"" institutional investors.3. Institutional investment moves up from 5.5% to over 40%.4. Confirmed Thermodox 2nd interim look will occur in Q2 2020.5. Confirmed phase 1 Gen-1 data by end of this month.The big institutional move is very bullish. They did not invest to lose their money."
"This stock is not the one trick pony it was 5 years ago. It has blockbuster drugs in two indications...liver and ovarian cancers. Success in either indication could result in a $30/share buyout...success in both would double that! The news that Gen-1 is safe at the highest, most effective dose level is important...but prolonged survival data will blow the roof off! Get it right and get in early is the way to do well in biotechs. If you don't like the science sell. If you like it now is the time to buy."
is anyone here negative on this company..... I'm thinking bout buying 1000 shares....but the 5 year chart is scary.....
Bummer about BTD. Looks like a long wait here now. Analysts on the call were asking tough critical questions about Placcine also- didnt seem to think its viable. Might sell this one next week
Seems $4+ today. $6+ by weeks end. Large volumes tell the story. Upward momentum.
"The recommendation was made following the second pre-planned interim safety and efficacy analysis by the DMC on July 9, 2020. The DMC analysis found that the pre-specified boundary for stopping the trial for futility of 0.900 was crossed with an actual value of 0.903. However, the 2-sided p-value of 0.524 for this analysis provides uncertainty, subsequently, the DMC has left the final decision of whether or not to stop the OPTIMA Study to Celsion. There were no safety concerns noted during the interim analysis.P > 0.05 is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. ... A statistically significant test result (P ≤ 0.05) means that the test hypothesis is false or should be rejected. A P value greater than 0.05 means that no effect was observed.""In the majority of analyses, an alpha of 0.05 is used as the cutoff for significance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the means and conclude that a significant difference does exist. If the p-value is larger than 0.05, we cannot conclude that a significant difference exists.That's pretty straightforward, right? Below 0.05, significant. Over 0.05, not significant""""a p-value of 0.524 is so much higher than 0.05 that you can't apply any wishful thinking to the results.""You would never use language to try to obscure the outcome of your analysis, would you?But here's a key point ""There were no safety concerns noted during the interim analysis."""
Delisting notice soon ….strong sell
"Celsion's share price may fluctuate some day to day. But the long term price will be upward as the Optima study moves to the finish line. The positive result is pretty much assured. The study was build around the the positive result from the subgroup of the Heat study that got RFA of at least 45 minutes. The National Institute of Health corroborate d the findings. The company says it has enough funds to get to the finish line without dilution. And if the results are positive Celsion's Thermodox will be the standard of care for liver cancer. I believe this buying this stock and holding it, is about like getting the winning numbers to the lottery before it happens....Glta .longs"
"Celsion had US$5.76m of debt in June 2021, down from US$10.00m, one year before. But on the other hand it also has US$58.5m in cash, leading to a US$52.7m net cash position."
"In the recent conference call, regarding portfolio development, they mentioned a new gen-1 based project. They didn’t say what it is and wouldn’t answer questions about it, except saying it’s in early stage, and its status would be updated in coming months.So what the project is? Is it a new cancer treatment project? With very limited money and resource, and the brain cancer study only in preclinical, I think the last thing they want right now is yet another costly/time consuming cancer program. So if not cancer, what it could be? They did give few hints:Gen-1 is a powerful platform (my reading: it can also deliver mRNA to the body).Gen-1 has significant medical and logistic advantage (my reading: logistic advantage is important).Gen-1 can address indications of global concerns (my reading: the biggest global concern).Currently, what’s the biggest global concern: Covid-19 pandemic; what’s the biggest logistic headache: mRNA vaccine distribution.Is it possible that the new project is a feasibility study of gen-1 delivery system for covid mRNA vaccine, possibly collaborating with a vaccine company.Currently both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use lipid based mRNA delivery systems, requiring storage temp at -20C and -70C, respectively. Gen-1, on the other hand, is a polymer-based technology. If it turns out that gen-1 based mRNA vaccine’s efficacy is the same and the low-temperature storage requirement is less stringent, then CLSN is in a serious business. And we are talking about a real game changer.I probably just read too much into the transcript, but we'll know soon enough."
"I'm very happy about today's trading action. There was incredible buying pressure in the a.m., enough to offset a very massive and very healthy sell off in the afternoon.I've known many investors that won't hold past the double. And if you bought as recently as the 15th, you're doubled. The demand for this stock in the resultant buying pressure are unusually strong. Others have considered perhaps a take over. Personally I think data leaked. It usually does from these trials. But if it leaked to deep pockets, this is the kind of trading action I would expect to see.Massive, relentless, accumulation. Nonstop. They're certainly not trying to be subtle or fly under the radar.This is in yo face buying!Good luck to all."

"Emerging data from the recent literature indicates that the quality of the immune response as opposed to its absolute magnitude is what dictates SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance and recovery and that an ineffective or non-neutralizing enhanced antibody response might actually exacerbate disease. The first-generation COVID-19 vaccines were developed for rapid production and deployment and were not optimized for generating cellular responses that result in effective viral clearance. Though early data has indicated some of these vaccines to be over 95% effective, these first-generation vaccines were primarily designed to generate a strong antibody response and, while they have been shown to provide prophylactic protection against disease, the durability of this protection is currently unclear. The vast majority of these vaccines have been specifically developed to target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein (antigen), though it is known that restricting a vaccine to a sole viral antigen creates selection pressure that can serve to facilitate the emergence of viral resistance. Indeed, even prior to full vaccine rollout, it has been observed that the S protein is a locus for rapid evolutionary and functional change as evidenced by the D614G, Y453F, 501Y.V2, and VUI-202012/01 mutations/deletions. This propensity for mutation of the S protein leads to future risk of efficacy reduction over time as these mutations accumulate.Celsion’s next generation vaccine initiative stands at the confluence of immunotherapy and immunogenicity and envisions delivery, on a single plasmid, multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in conjunction with a potent immune modifier, interleukin-12 (IL-12), which directs a TH-1 immune response, stimulates T-cell immunity, and also promises the promotion of humoral immunity (antibody response). While most COVID-19 vaccines in late-stage clinical development are monovalent (S protein antigen only), Celsion has taken this multivalent approach in an effort to generate an even more robust immune response that not only results in a strong neutralizing antibody response, but also a more robust and durable T-cell response.Celsion’s vaccine candidate approach comprises a single plasmid vector containing the DNA sequence encoding the cytokine IL-12 and multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including S antigen in combination with the membrane (M) or nucleocapsid (N) antigen. Delivery will be evaluated intramuscularly, intradermally, or subcutaneously with a non-viral synthetic DNA delivery carrier that facilitates vector delivery into the cells of the injected tissue and has potential immune adjuvant properties. Unique designs and formulations of Celsion vaccine candidates offer several key advantages. While the antibodies against S antigen would prevent virus entry into cells, the M and N antibodies could help virus clearance through antibody-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis. The presentation of multiple antigens on the cell surface of vaccine-injected tissue produces a broad variety of killer T-cells which could potentially produce more efficient viral clearance than a single antigen vaccine. Since IL-12 is an essential regulator of the differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of T helper 1 (TH-1) cells that generate killer T-cells and memory T-cells against virally infected cells, its simultaneous expression could boost the viral clearance by the vaccine and improve the immune system’s memory against any future exposure of the same virus. Finally, the synthetic polymeric DNA carrier is an important component of the vaccine composition as it has the potential to facilitate the vaccine immunogenicity by improving vector delivery and, due to potential adjuvant properties, attract professional immune cells to the site of vaccine delivery.￼Celsion’s PLACCINE DNA vaccine technology platform is characterized by a single multi-cistronic DNA plasmid vector expressing multiple pathogen antigens along with a potent immune modifier and delivered with a synthetic delivery system. It is easily adaptable to creating vaccines for a multitude of pathogens, including emerging pathogens leading to pandemics as well as infectious diseases that have yet to be effectively addressed with current vaccine technologies. This flexible vaccine platform is well supported by an already established supply chain to produce any plasmid vector and its assembly into a respective vaccine formulation. ￼"

"Celsion Receives $2 Million Allocation Through the New Jersey Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer (NOL) Program Non-Dilutive Funding Strengthens Balance Sheet; Extends Current Operating Runway to Over Three Years LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Feb. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN), a clinical stage development company focused on DNA based immunotherapy and next generation vaccines, today announced it has received approval from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's (NJEDA) Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer (NOL) program to sell $2 million of its unused New Jersey net operating losses (NOLs) for the tax years 2018 and 2019. The NOLs are typically sold at a small, single-digit discount to qualified companies with operations in New Jersey. As a result, the Company anticipates it will be able to transfer this credit and receive approximately $1.85 million of net cash proceeds. With this additional funding, the Company expects to report over $54 million in cash and investments at end of the first quarter ending March 31, 2021. This competitive program, administered by the NJEDA, enables qualified companies to sell their unused New Jersey net operating losses and R&D tax credits to unaffiliated, profit-generating corporate taxpayers in the state of New Jersey, up to a current maximum lifetime benefit of $15 million per company. This allows technology and biotechnology companies with NOLs to turn their tax losses and credits into cash proceeds to fund more R&D, expand its workforce, and cover other allowable expenditures. Celsion was one of several qualifying biotechnology/technology companies to share in the funding this year. ""The NJEDA's NOL program reinforces our belief in the State of New Jersey's commitment to biotechnology research. With the New Jersey State Legislature increasing the maximum lifetime benefit per company from $15 million to $20 million, we plan to participate in this innovative funding program again next year,"" said Michael H. Tardugno, Celsion Corporation's chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""The proceeds from the NOL sale helps augment our cash position, and together with the recent $35 million common stock only financing in January 2021, at the current spending rate, extends our operating runway into the first quarter of 2024. With this new, non-dilutive funding, we are positioned to continue to advance our recently announced vaccine initiative. Additionally, we expect these funds to cover full patient enrollment and primary efficacy read-out of the Phase I/II OVATION 2 Study for GEN-1, depending upon the extent to which Progression Free Survival (PFS) is achieved. We appreciate the support and commitment of the NJEDA in facilitating our continued innovation and applaud their efforts to foster continued investment and growth for businesses in New Jersey."" ""Throughout the course of 2020 and into the first quarter of 2021, Celsion has sought innovative ways to finance our clinical development programs in some of the world's most challenging cancers. Balancing the high cost of research and drug development without losing focus on our shareholders is reflected in our successful application to sell $15 million of our New Jersey NOL's over the past three years,"" said Jeffrey W. Church, Celsion Corporation's Executive Vice President and CFO. ""With the support of our shareholders, we look forward to an exciting and promising year ahead.""

I am an RN And I spend much time into reading about new research related to medical Science and the report that they posted today looks very exciting with scientific basis.I would not be surprise if the valuation of this stock goes up in no time as their vaccine could become the major player to combat the covid and this pandemic as their vaccine seems to be easier to manage and distribute to remote places storage wise

This company is planning something BIG for February 2021 or next week based on the high option plays from yesterday. This upcoming week we may have some PR news or at least sometime next month. I have 400 shares at $2.08. Down at the moment but the big bounce coming soon. Stay strong!
"Next two weeks will be pivotal for the stocks valuation. An ability to remain above $4.50/$5 in a lead up to Phase 3 news will put the stock on good position for buyout or even just a value influx. Buckle in, it’s about to get interesting"

"Anything coming that could shock the HCC world? I think yes. We got single lesions covered but what if we can save the multiple and larger lesions patients. Read thisinfo related to CLSN new info with Ultra sound:Focused ultrasound is an optimal technology for inducing hyperthermia because of its precise focus and its ability to deposit energy in various shapes and sizes. Tissue temperature can be monitored in real time using magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging or interstitial thermocouples, which allows for the accurate control of the treatment.The effects induced by local hyperthermia are temporary and precise, and hold potential to make focused ultrasound an excellent complement to drug therapy because of focused ultrasound’s ability to penetrate deep into the body, there are numerous and wide ranging potential clinical uses for hyperthermia. Many drugs would benefit from the enhanced delivery and efficacy, and mild hyperthermia has even been shown to induce an immune response. We may see human data soon that states the treatment with temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin and local hyperthermia results in higher intratumor drug concentrations and improves therapeutic efficacy, compared with treatment with either free doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin without hyperthermia. An upgrade to Thermodox (HIFU)after approval on the table that could also tackle brain and breast cancers? They keep going to HIFU so they must think there is something big there.I have not seen a cancer bio company with the data we have on the 2 drug trials trading at this low of a market cap ever. Things are going to get real interesting here imho. GLTA"
This is the most boring stock I ever owned.
"It may be whacky but I don’t think the Thermodox story is done. It’s too weird that all the studies, prior NIH study, earlier results, early readout, and analysis could all be wrong. It’s logical that Thermodox should deliver. 26 deaths suddenly ? They have cash, a supporting long term investor. ,and the Gen 2 so it’s worth a shot.26 patients? And the crazy 90."
"Depending on the pricing, and assuming a minimum of 100,000 patients per year, annual revenue should reach from $500 million up to perhaps $3 billion per year. If even the low number is achieved, Celsion's market cap could go to $10 billion. Which (presuming no more stock is issued, which is unlikely) would come to (drum roll): $333 per share. - William MeyersLong only, tech, biotech, research analyst"

A Good Press Release can bring this back to $1.50 a next stage in the GEN-1 confirmation brings this $4-$5 easy.
"I'm gonna sell my 1000 shares and short 2000 shares....if u can't beat em, join em...."
"All the articles I'm reading states that the fast track was supposed to be submitted in February of 2021 for clsn. once submitted, it will take 60 days for approval. does anyone have more information on this, do they have to get to ph 3 trials before submission?"
We will see a very nice rise this week recommend accumulating here. Money to be made.
Everyone Vote ‘No’ for increasing shares. Say No to more dilution. Let this management shows it’s performance first. Overall Bullish for Gen-1 (Ovarian Cancer) & Vaccine platform.
shorts win again today......
My Celsion senses are tingling right now. They are telling me it's time to load the boat
Find me just one other biotech with a 34M MC nearing the end of a P3 trial. The market is saying that both ThermoDox and Gen-1 have no market value even though the data in both indications is looking good. Hard to understand this disconnect

"ok, this is getting out of hand.....let's all short a few shares and bring this back to reality....."
Come on baby .. make the turn up!!!
So...$7-$9 is expected in my opinion in the weeks leading up to results outlined. Accumulating. Going for a significant run. The language and data are extremely positive indicators. Have a great day.

"For the South Africa variant, Covid vaccines' efficacy is much less: J&J is 57%, NovaVax is 49.4%.Today, Pfizer CEO warns at Davos economic forum: ""It's a very high likelihood that current vaccines will not be effective in the future.""If they do it right, CLSN's vaccine technology could save a lot of lives."
"If Gen-1 and Thermodox are approved their total revenues could be in the $2-3 billion range. We get important Gen-1 news in the next week or two. We get important Thermodox news in the next month or two. Gen-1 has been overlooked by the market and even by long time CLSN investors. If Gen-1 continues to produce 90-100% ORR and excellent debulking results, while demonstrating increasingly excellent immunotherapy activity....CLSN has a winner. The FDA will grant some form of expedited approval and big pharma will wake up. Partnerships or buyout? We will know a lot more by the end of this month! The Q4 CC will be interesting."
Just lost 5k on celsion. Anyone have other stocks that look promising and have big potential just a little on the safer side? Thanks
Average down and load the boat and HOLD!!! Good things are on the horizon!!
"What the newbs on this board don’t understand is that no biotech with a market cap under $300m has ever delivered a successful phase 3 cancer trial result. In thousands of trials, it has Never happened! Pretty amazing! Why is this rule so accurate? Because people talk. Patients and doctors talk. If a drug is working, word spreads and the stock price goes up. Why does this apply to eryp? Because the stock has shown absolutely no signs of life despite an upcoming pancreatic cancer read out. No buzz, no rumors, no nothing. When the failed trial is announced the stock will go to $1. You have been warned"
"Hey guys, tell me something concrete about this company, is it worth to do DD here? is it worth investing?"
Thermodox in phase 3 with results in July and this is the second time around. They have enough cash till mid 2021 and they have another treatment in the pipeline for Ovarian cancer in phase 1.and a low float of 28 million shares which 2 investment firms own 5%. Hmmm this reminds me a little of Sarepta Therapeutics SRPT way back with getting approval for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Lets hope for liver cancer patients to extend their lives that this happens. Any thoughts. Long this stock for a while.
No one makes money here …longs or shorts
Delisting clock is ticking
"CLSN and treating AD (Alzheimer's Disease)CLSN' doesn't treat AD currently. But this could change by an unexpected research finding.This finding was made by Harvard University/Massachusetts General Hospital and published on 6/23/2021.The paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.12399Researchers found that 2 cytokines can slow AD in aging adults. The 2 cytokines (small proteins) are IL-12 and IFN-γ.The finding is: ""Higher IL-12p70 was associated with slower cognitive decline in the setting of higher Aβ (amyloid beta).And higher IFN-γ was associated with slower cognitive decline independent of Aβ.""And the researchers conclude: ""greater IL-12/IFN-γ axis activation may be protective against cognitive decline and early-stage AD progression.""How this has any thing to do with CLSN?Remember what the GEN-1 is used for. It is specifically used to elevating IL-12 level and does it successfully!And the new vaccine platform also has an IL-12 elevation component.A new possibility? They should give it a good look."
"They are playing it safe! As an investor, I appreciate that! I would rather have the company take some extra expense money than to see some robin hood rookies short it as it goes up! I doubled my position and bought some more today and will do so so responsibly daily. I feel this price is cheap for where we are headed. I lost my mom to a very nasty kind of leukemia not too long ago. The therapies kept her for an extra 3 years! These three years gave me a chance to show her my uttmost love and attention. We went on trips together and enjoyed delicious meals and lots of huggs and happy moments. Those three extra years meant the world to the entire family.The Optima study shows that patients recieving this treatment last longer to say the least. This is a good thing and there's no reason for it not to go through. Numbers speak for themselves. https://investor.celsion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/celsion-affirms-july-timing-second-interim-analysis-phase-iii"

"CLSN recently disclosed they are planning to apply for BTD for Gen-1 in Ovarian cancer. If this is granted by the FDA (which takes about 60 days), the stock will skyrocket because it means CLSN can get this to patients much sooner. Don't sell, this is real news"

Time for the yearly delisting notice….
"LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., Feb. 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ: CLSN), a clinical stage development company focused on DNA based immunotherapy and next generation vaccines, today announced that it has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for GEN-1, its DNA-mediated interleukin-12 (IL-12) immunotherapy currently in Phase II development for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. GEN-1 was designed using TheraPlas, Celsion's proprietary, synthetic, non-viral nanoparticle delivery system platform.Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatory review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

"On the real> They need an investor to pony up 2 quarters worth of funds...and quick. Give then 1.70 a share offering. Or It may be time to merge with a company that believes in the trials and has the cash to see it thru. Im not sure a company exists at this point. If Gen-1 had positive phase 11 positive than it could happen. A partnership with a big Pharma isn't realistic either but they are really getting close to not having enough money. Shorts will probably kill the PPS on the first data read out and even though both trials will most likely have good read outs next year, the PPS will be to low for offerings. They are just cutting this way to close. Arghhhhhh"
We should know soon if a 13D is filed. With the more than 22 Million shares traded this past Friday and close to 11 million shares traded today it could be a big boy takeover or major institution(s) loading up. Traders or short sighted people don’t understand that many of the 29 million shares might be locked up which will be like rocket  fuel.
shorties poping the corks....
Obviously this stock is greatly undervalued! Here is why I am interested.1. It has two drugs which serve significantly underserved billion dollar markets (liver cancer and ovarian cancer).2. There are fewer than 25 million shares out.3. One drug(liver cancer) has both fast track and orphan drug designation and in a few months will report its pivotal phase 3 trial interim results.4. The second drug (ovarian cancer) will soon (next month?) most likely be moving into a pivotal trial. It should easily receive fast track and orphan designation...and may even be granted breakthrough designation. If this happens the market will notice!5. Both drugs combine safely and effectively with the current first line standard of care...greatly enhancing market uptake.6. All this with a market cap of under $40 million? I'm in!
"This would be a breakthrough medicine once it is finally approved. Looks like it is very effective and less or no side effects. Basically it kills cancer cells without killing healthy cells. We know it from their past presentations. But now FDA confirmed by giving the company a spl status to expedite!I am excited and glad I am holding good amount!This is a good one to keep long term.. Remember, rest of the market is sooooo over rated and about to have a correction. CLSN will only go up from here.I also hold TXNP and ONTX."
"Oppenheimer comments...Celsion Corporation (CLSN) reported 4Q18 and provided a business update to investors last Friday. In focus, CLSN is approaching two interim analyses for ThermoDox from the fully-enrolled Phase 3 OPTIMA study expected in 3Q19 and 2020. We are encouraged by the DMC's December 18, 2018 assessment, highlighting a median PFS of 21.2 months as of the October 4th data cut-off. In addition, the earlier-stage OVATION II with GEN-1 continues to progress, enrolling patients for dose selection and safety. With 2018 year-end cash of $27.7 million, CLSN has ample runway to reach these meaningful potential value-creating catalysts, in our view. We remain bullish."
"Investors in Celsion Corporation CLSN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 15, 2021 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."

"Only one company has broken the Feuerstein-Ratain rule.The F-R 'rule' is actually an empirical observation that companies with a market cap of less than $300 million 4 months prior to the release of phase 3 data for oncology trials always have unsuccessful phase 3 data. This has been true for about 100 companies, and the rule has only been broken once in the past ~ 10 years. The company that broke the rule was Celator, which had a MC of only $60 million prior to releasing positive phase 3 results in its AML trial. Celator was subsequently acquired by JAZZ for $1.5 billion.So, will CLSN be another exception to the rule? Based on the statistics for other microcap oncology companies, the odds are 100:1 against this happening.However, I believe that there's a good chance (in the range of 25-50%) that CLSN will beat the odds with its OPTIMA trial, mainly because the HEAT trial showed positive results in the subgroup that the OPTIMA trial is targeting.Low market caps for companies show a lack of interest and/or confidence by the market in those companies.In CLSN's case, this can be explained by the market's disdain for post-hoc analysis of failed trials. Once a trial fails, investors lose interest, and want to move on to the next big thing, regardless of the learnings from the initial failed trial. I believe this market 'blind spot' presents a significant opportunity for investors.The company's strategy has been to focus on China first, which makes sense, because about half of all new liver cancer cases globally occur in China (~400,000 cases in China, ~800,000 globally).If the OPTIMA trial is successful, and Thermodox is used in 100,000 cases per year in China, at a revenue of $5k per treatment for CLSN, annual sales would be $500 million. Global sales could be several times that number, due to the potential for higher revenues per treatment in western countries.At a price-sales ratio of 4, the company's MC could range from $2 - $10 billion several years from now.Or, it could get bought out shortly after positive results are announced (Celator was bought for $1.5 billion 2 months after it reported positive phase 3 data).Assuming a MC of $1 billion after reporting successful results in the OPTIMA trial, and a 33% chance of success, and assuming 20% dilution, I calculate a reward to risk ratio of:0.33*(1-0.2)*1 billion/$88 million = 3.So, even after the stock's recent run-up, the risk-reward ratio for CLSN appears quite favorable.I continue to hold my shares."
"In less than 30 days, CLSN will release data that could lead to approval and $1B+ in revenue. This is blockbuster territory, where the resulting market cap should be $2-3B (about $100 per share). But the stock is at 3 bucks. Clearly large money institutional investors do not believe the story. Creates a once in a lifetime opportunity if it pans out. I'm in"
"20% drop too severe with only 10% new shares addd backed by real money ($10 M real money for co)Traders took their safety $ and now that PPS stabilises, they will slowly jump back in.Looking for $ 5 ish end of next week.Too much to lose when positive data read out comes out. Again most likely because of low success bar."
"Aspire deal registered. Aspire expects to sell shares within 30 months but cannot short or hedge. So far Aspire only owns 400,000 shares. This is not a secondary offering to sell 4,500,000 shares to Aspire.(yet) Could just be potential sale by clsn to gain advantage in partnering at second look or other news. Aspire has alerted t it may sell as much as 4,500,000 shares if forced to buy that much by clsn. So far about all that has changed are the expenses to clsn. (100,000 shares to Aspire and cost of registration est $35,000. As i said before I fear Aspire deals. Still if second look at Optima is good Aspire can make money on the long side. Problem is Aspire plays this game all the time in bio and clsn has a learning curve.Would like other opinions."
"CEO letter released today. He explains why they raised some cash to take them well into 2021. And added...""We reaffirm expectations to report data from the second pre-planned interim efficacy analysis for the Phase III OPTIMA Study in the second quarter of 2020. Enrollment in this trial was completed in August 2018, and given our primary endpoint of survival, we do not expect any major disruptions in patient follow-up or data reporting owing to COVID-19. In addition, early Phase I data from the OVATION 2 Study is expected by the end of the current quarter. Our supply chains are robust. Commercial interest in ThermoDox is high and increasing."""

"###############################################################################CLSN: a lot of major near-term catalysts for higher PPS ahead: My PPS Target 2020: 5$; Here is why.###############################################################################The market obviously gives CLSN no credit for its development pipeline. This is due to the fact that CLSN's most important pipeline product – ThermoDox – had a major setback in its pivotal clinical trial 2013. But this is past history and the company has made great achievements with ThermoDox and GEN-1 and the risk:reward ratio has never been better IMHO.Now the risk of missing out a big opportunity is high and a series of catalysts for a major increase of the company value and share price are just ahead and there is no Immediate need for further financing this year.

All these events have the potential to unlock the real pipeline and company value – because both advanced pipeline products (ThermoDox and GEN-1) address a billion $ market opportunity each - with an urgent need in their proposed indications. The ThermoDox registrational Phase III trial is a global trial – designed to support the approval in US, China and EU.The company has a balance sheet which supports operations and trials until mid 2021 (company statement). The company can tap the opportunity of selling Net Operating Loss – a non dilutive measure."

Is it a good thing or a bad thing that there haven’t been any leaks yet and that institutions haven’t really bought in yet? I believe in this drug but I’m finding it hard to believe that I see something that huge institutions are missing especially when they have better information on this.
