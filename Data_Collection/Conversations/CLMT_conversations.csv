"There is nothing compelling about a stranded asset in MontanaThe problem for CLMT is they have bonds due and no way to pay for them.Who ever dreamt up this crazy scheme to turn a 35 MB/D cash cow into a 5MB/D RND and a 12 MB/D Asphalt topping plant ought to be fired!The fat lady is about to singThey duped us…but if you have a positive position, get out…learn"
Someone post a plausible reason for the secrecy that has positive implication for the project’s prospectsOne plausible reason….I’ll wait
Why the 3% Increase today ???
"Scam AlertNew across the wires that CLMT has just announced the selection of Halder Topsoe as their technology vendor for the RND plantThe problem is, They have the process backwardsThe technology selection is the starting point for engineering….I’m not an engineer but I know all the balances for heat, material flows, controls, and even reactor design follow that…They haven’t even ordered the catalystThe project status of an April startup is a scamCan’t happen safely."
"Anybody tuned in…So they are relying on a new farming industry in Montana to generate feedstock?Farming, crop handling, processing, crushing, oil production?In Montana? What?Who is doing that? Where are those plans?They just decided NOW to take an FCCU T/A in the next three months…in the winter?Never heard of a more defensive negative earning callMuch worse than I thoughtI’m gone"
"Buy,buy, by me"
Can we skip buying the stock and still get the Grapes and Super Models
"One would like to think that, at SOME point, losing 50% of your valuation in months would spur the board to action. Especially in what's been a boon for refiners, losing this much demonstrates the market's clear loss of confidence in Go and his team. As I've said, they have gotten us through the tough times but have given us no evidence that they are truly visionary and growth minded. You can cut expenses and efficiency your way to prosperity. With that said, I still have faith that the company, at its core, has a strong and enduring business model. We just need better and more vocal leadership. BTW... wouldn't a decline in this much of valuation adversely affect their leverage ratio ? smh..."

"When a stock jumps up 4% or 5% a day for several days in a row, there's a reason. But I see nothing in the news from CLMT, no press announcements. Volume is below average, so it's not a buying frenzy. Any ideas?"
Very orderly buying; nothing sloppy in today’s price action… very interesting 
Wish I could sell this stock but it would be too much of a loss.I have been waiting for over 8 years so far.
Why the 4% increase today ??????
"Alberta has dropped production limits. The wti/wcs diff should widen. Good for GF, maybe we get a sale before the end of the year."
With all that cash...think they’ll share the wealth? Or use it to pay down some debt?

"3/24/21Wells Fargo Upgrades Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (CLMT) $8.00 Equal Weight -> Overweight"
PR Newswire says on our about Dec 28th for Q3...
Appears to be a strong Q1 - continuing to trend in the right direction. The market's response and call should be interesting.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calumet-specialty-products-partners-l-110000265.html
ESG REVOLUTION!!! 
Here's some news.https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17123622-calumet-specialty-products-partners-l-p-announces-acquisition-biosynthetic-technologies-llc
"The Philly Energy Solutions refinery fire takes 335k barrels/day off line. Not sure for how long, but damage could be considerable. I see CVI is up about 4% on the news and I would expect other refiner stock to move higher over the coming days as traders realize the impact on refining margins may last for quite a while. CLMT is already having a strong Q, but with the removal of such a large refinery, I would expect refining margins to strengthen across the board as gas and diesel will be moved from other markets to compensate the lost production. At the same time, crude demand will likely fall with the reduced refinery capacity. So once the Iran tensions moderate, I would guess we will see WTI fall back some on continued inventory builds. If I remember right, we had a similar situation a couple of years back when a large refinery in the upper Midwest (Illinois, Ohio?) was taken off line for an extended period. Will see. GL"
understand it to be 11/21/2017.....
"If you look at page 16 of today’s BofA presentation, you will see that they upped their EBITDA guidance from $175 million to 240 million for the Montana Renewable Diesel venture."
"In the Wells Fargo report, Roger discounts his price target 50% from $16 to $8 to account for potential execution issues. Also states there is $3 to $9 worth of upside potential not factored into his analysis depending on how the joint venture is structured. Under the most ideal scenario (unlikely) CLMT secures a JV deal and executes their plan perfectly, Roger is saying a valuation of $25 is within reach. More likely scenario is a price target of $16 to $18 in the next 18 months. I’ll take it!!!"
I really like the consolidation at this level - we are setting up very well for higher highs 
"Just a heads up - GoSlow's comments correspond to the build up in the short position over the past two months, from 67K to 230K. Not a meaningful short position by any stretch of the imagination. It is clear, however, his objective here is to spread FUD. Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt"
BEARS INSIDER SELLING TODAY
"A couple of thoughts heading into the Q4 earnings release. I agree with an earlier assessment that based on the huge decline in crude prices in the quarter, it is likely that GAAP earnings will be negative. This will be caused by a large non-cash lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory mark, which also is netted out of the adjusted EBITDA and the distributable cash flow (DCF) numbers. While more useful than the GAAP number, I believe this is still misleading as to the actual performance. I am more interested in the cash being generated from earnings (i.e. reported DCF + non-cash LCM adjustment), that is available for debt reduction, and eventual distributions (similar to the FFO calc for REITs). Based on their earlier press release, liquidity improved $91MM. If even one-third of this was generated from earnings verse balance sheet changes, I would consider this a win for what is typically their weakest quarter in the cycle, and in light of Q4’s past.Also, in the past when crude prices tumbled, the company has seized the opportunity to increase their forward crude purchases to improve future refining margins. The Q1 2016 10-Q reflected significant purchases in the quarter for the remainder of 2016 & 2017. Further, as of 9/30/18, the company had sizable portions of their WCS and WTI-Midland needs locked in for 2019 and the first ½ of 2019, respectively, at excellent margins. I will be interested to see if they rolled/added to their hedging positions and/or started some forward crude purchasing. While the extreme discount for WCS has narrowed to about $12/barrel currently, the Great Falls diesel crack spread is still extraordinary and diesel cracks’ in general should offset a lot of the early Q1 weakness observed in the gulf coast gasoline crack as we move into spring. More importantly though, Specialty margins should be doing just fine so far in Q1.Overall, with the lower crude pricing reset, the majority of the heavy turnaround schedule in the rearview, and continued self-help improvements, 2019 should be a much stronger year, but it wouldn’t hurt to start out the year coming off a better than average Q4. GL longs."
"CLMT has lost one third of it's value since the first of June. With positive FCF, no debt payments due in 2020 and 2021, the possible sale of a major refinery (GF) and the possibility of restarting distributions, you'd think this stock would be approaching $4 not $2. Maybe this will change whenQ4 results are posted in August or September."
looks like finally bottemed out . 3yrs since last distribution. some positives- BUFFET says yes to oil (OXY). US INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE coming (asphalt). OIL staying up there $60. interest rate still low . might finally be a buy
Anybody see they are having a ribbon cutting ceremony today with the Governor of Montana?Yeah to celebrate the delivery of RND feedstock….Could they be any more transparently pathetic?What possible purpose does this serve other than to create a smoke screen?Let me see if I can find out how much…
Picking up support Zacks and Moody like it ....just upgraded Zacks has been positive on the stock for a few months. I think we have two good quarters coming EBITA will be terrific and expect debt reduction
This is just starting. Street is finally seeing value in the Co. with the GF JV plan in addition to solid specialty business. Cash from JV will bring leverage down to correct levels considering the EBIDTA once JV is fully operational then distribution can be reestablished.
"Reversion to the mean - $5.50 looks to be the support. The accumulation is real at this level. Look for a breakout of the $XOP in the weeks to come, this should translate to higher highs for us longs. Looking forward to the ride in the month of May "
"I Spoke with Jeff from IR (312) 445-2870 and expressed my concern for the companies silence on earnings. I told him am a long-term investor which I am and that I'm concerned that there may be something nefarious the company is telling us. He said they are shooting for a March 10th earnings release, and a press release should be going out in 2 -3 days tops. When I expressed my concern an investor, I told him wanted to be sure the company is not having more problems adjusting to the new ERP. He assured me that they aren't, but that they want to make sure they don't run into the same accounting problem as last time which is why they are airing on caution for an earlier than necessary earnings release. I told him the stock price keeps deteriorating due to the companies silence and hope that the CEO is aware. He pointed out that the stock is up a nickel.....I said seriously?????? It's down from 9.90 more than just a nickel, but l am glad he sees that as a positive move in the right direction."
Has anyone else noticed the open interest in the January '19 $10 calls? I don't recall ever seeing so much open interest in the past. Even the Jan. '19 $15 calls are showing good interest.
"Canyon Traveler is correct, I haven’t posted anywhere elseWhat I have posted are news related and have asked specific questionsI don’t know this Traveler guy, and he doesn’t know my positions, even though I have repeated revealed my positionsSo again for the record…I sold my CLMT shares once I realized I was being duped by management.I held my puts which were originally bought to protect my investment, and those have done nicely with each silly event CLMT holdsI have friends who hold CLMT and yes, I hope to help them get out of the bear trap….there are no buyers"
"If they reinstate a distribution in 2020 this stock will be up to $20 (fcf, good profit margins, stable products, ). I would venture to guess that 2021 should be a very good year for investors if mgmt. can fix the problem of useless refineries bought 4-6 years ago. Looking good so far!"
"Lots of day trading IMO. Obviously shorts saw the opportunity here toward the end of the day, or somebody with a sizeable position started the rout."
There is more action on this board than there is trading on this stock.The hypsters have all but disappeared.Their red faces can’t be shownHow embarrassing for the emperor…no hiding the truth…no JV Partner
Volume Strong Today. Fund managers placing their bets for 2020?
Holding around 8.00.......this is positive ....expect full explanation before 12/31/2017 Imo
"Anyone else notice they volume of trading has all but dried up on CLMT?There are few folks taking interest and I can’t help but think it is because of the darth of information.If the JV falls apart, there will be nobody to buy….Go Slow…"
"I now think, Calumet doesn’t want any part of the RND project…they want out with the core business being specialty products.It that is true, I predict they sell the Montana refinery for about 100 MM$ and let the new owner decide on the RND project.Good luck longs"
Anyone have any guesses when the dividend comes back and guesses of how much
EBITDA has almost quadrupled since this time last year. Along with rising revenues and the shedding of some expensive assets to clear debt I expect this to be a great earnings call.
"Alright, I see by their presentation they increased their locked in WCS position to 40% of total WCS needs for the entire year of 2019. The WCS differential increased by 4,000 BPD to 5,000 BPD for 2019 @ $33.96/barrel. This joins their previously hedged ULSD crack at 72.1% margin. OUTSTANDING. For Q1 & Q2, they also have 40% of WTI-Midland needs locked in @ $12.79 & $11.74 differential discounts, respectively. Again, this is great. The presentation indicates Specialty is off to a strong start for Q1. We could see a really nice run into the Q1 report in May. GL longs."
Shares now hit $6/shr with almost no buyers.Options are due this Friday…and a break below $6 will wipe out a big number of $6 call options…The emperor has no clothes
"Do you remember when Calumet was trying to sell the Montana Refinery…They said then:It was crude advantaged to low cost Canadian Crude via pipeline and in PADD IV where cracked spreads were highest. Production was setting records? Cash cowThe result: No buyersSo the dreamt up the RND project which undoes all those “advantages”They now say:It’s feedstock advantaged and situated close to California?!? Ahhhhh….NoRail the feedstock in and Rail the products out….Montana is a disadvantaged locationIt’s a stranded asset, where product demand is low. Hard to operate in the winter and not a skilled work force baseWho are they kidding? Us?They put a 50 MB/D Hydrocracker in a 25 MB/D Asphalt plantPreinvestment?Ahhhhhh…..KnowMBA 101No Preinvestment"
"Per the press release, it appears the company repurchased another $50MM prior to closing the new bond issue. So $140MM YTD bond repurchases from cash flow, and is trading at a market cap of < 2x free CF. This is so cheap, I wonder why the GP doesn't make a move to take it private, or at least increase their limited partner hold. Also, the Great Falls crack (diesel) is over $40/barrel with widening of the WCS spread and surging diesel prices. One day longs!"
Can we hold $3 today?
"Everyone on this board is cheering this stock, which has destroyed investor capital for 7-8 years in a row. If history is a guide, they will take advantage of the recent rise and do another equity issuance."
My money says the JV is with $ET
"Here is a quick update of some key refining market indicators from the CVR Energy Q2 report released after the bell (7/24/19). From Q1-2019, the NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread improved $3.34/barrel to $22.41; the WTI-Midland differential increased $1.18 to $2.27/barrel, and WCS differential increased $2.12/barrel to $12.63. As far as the small refinery waiver, the whole exemption process is under a review, so likely won't hear any decision on this or another couple of months. That said, CLMT has a pretty good chance of getting their exemptions approved eventually for their smaller refineries. GL"
"I listened to the BOA presentation yesterday and Calumets management confirmed there are multiple bidders for Great Falls. Some domestic and some international companies. Although, the timing for the sale will come later in the year due to Covid-19, this bodes well for getting a decent price for this facility."
Looks like they must have said something negative at the conference today... or at least it was interpreted that way.
"Did anyone hear in the conference call, they just the bids back for engineering and construction of the new required H2 plant.Remember, the RND is stuck at 5 MB/D until the new H2 plant comes into production.They knew this all along.Studied for 18 monthsAnnounced in Feb 2021, 6 months agoNow middle August with no movement on JV, H2 Plant Project, or Pretreatment plantFolks, that was 2 years agoThe emperor has no canola oil!"
It would be great to park this number north of $7 to shove it to the buyers of puts on the expiration date! Die broke!
"Jan 19, 2016 was the last time CLMT declared a distribution o approx. $.68/unit. That was5 years ago. At that time CLMT had a debt of $3.3 bil. Now the debt is $2.3 bil and there is a possibility that will sell one of their assets for $700mil or $500mi cutting debt by 50 or 40%. With oil approaching $50/barrel and possible triple digit FCF. It might be time that CLMT would consider restoring a modified distribution. That could happen on 1/19/21."

Any guestimation on future value? Amount and when?
"Here is a statement from the q2 19 10K for Calumet; •Environmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the cost of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). To the extent we are unable to blend biofuels, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our annual requirement. The approximate 80% increase in the price of RINs during the second quarter 2019 unfavorably affected our results of operations. It is not possible to predict what future RINs volumes or costs may be given the volatile price of RINs, but we continue to anticipate that RINs have the potential to remain a significant expense for our fuel products segment (inclusive of the favorable impact of exemptions received), assuming current market prices for RINs continue. While we applied for RINs exemptions, we have not learned whether we will receive any exemptions in 2019 for the 2018 operating year. In the details of this 10K it states that for Q2 19 RINS were worth 21mil and that for Q1 19 12mil. Or about 17mil for an average. Mr. Go said that the company expects to get word that their partition to suspend RINs was expected to be approved in the next 3-4 weeks. This should result in an expense savings of about 10mil for Q3 19. Given that and a strong Q2 19 report, why has the price of Calumets stock gone down 20% since earnings were announced?"
Renewable diesel production capacity is expected to nearly quintuple to about 2.65 billion gallons (63 million barrels) by 2024The Calumet RND project will be soybean oil only….in 2022 thru 2024.Anyone willing to do the soybean oil balance will see…The Soybean crop is being decimated by the northern plains heat wave.This seasonal drop off can not be recovered by 2022 winter productionThis ship has sailed…
"Go has said he prefers to focus on EBITDA so as to reduce leverage by growing the business. He has previously said debt/EBITDA Would need to be 4x or less before distributions would resume. The company is a MLP and must distribute eventually. Growth plus self help cost containment is the avenue to turnaround and is tracking nicely. There will be a distribution and not in the too-distant future. When that happens the undervalue of the stock price will reverse quickly and dramatically to something reflecting 8 percent return on investment. Stay the course, sailors!"
"Nearly $100M adj. ebitda, w/ the hurricane & ERP cf...I'll take that all day long."
"This price action is feeling like a “bull trap” I am expecting a lot of volatility between now and JV announcement - with the low float, and options contracts expiring Friday, things are going to get wild…"
One GF is converted to biodiesel and earning $220 to $260M EBITDA it should be a $1.5B asset!
More good news! Sounds like CLMT might pay off their recently refinanced debt much sooner than we all thought.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298112-rhizome-partners-calumet-specialty-products-partners-l-p
Tim Go and team have excited the institutional investors with their attendance at recent conferences. Im expecting big things between now and earnings in early August. Im loading up so i can sit back and collect a quarterly distribution in the near future.
"Trades are going off in 10,000 blocks. Someone establishing a sizeable position in CLMT. Nice to see!"
"If we had vision three years ago that the company was going to do this well executing it’s turn around plan, more than likely we would have been trading in the mid teens. The prospects of not paying a distribution in the near future is definitely a big reason why we are not gaining traction yet. For those who know the history of this company, our future looks pretty bright. Our debt ratio is headed under 4. Exposure to the volatile swings of the fuels market is way down. The money poured into our ERP system which caused a lot of money and headaches initially is now paying big dividends in self help initiatives. The company has successfully transitioned from a risk ladened, low margin business to a much more predictable higher margin business model. So yes Tim Go leaving introduces some uncertainty short term but that too will pass. This is a really good company headed in the right direction— throwing off a nice amount of cash. At some point the valuation will reflect the progress we’ve made as well as a promising future."
Anybody hear anything on the JV?
What’s the spike for
"Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P is down 6.55% to 5.42"
"Great quarter all around, and retired debt. Lets see where we go today."
Has a K1 been issued for 2020?
11.5% notes officially paid
It would becoming clear….No JV partner is coming in to pay down CLMT debt….so they can participate in a RND project …with a sick partnerAccording to Bruce Fleming….they structured a deal without the rest of the refinery. CLMT will end up owning all the liabilities of a 15 MB/D Asphalt refinery with HF AlkyCash Cow?Ahhhhh….no
"Today's Calumet has a whole different feel to it! Although I really liked what Tim Go did for the company, I think his main talent was to pull the reigns back in, sell off pieces of the company to focus on Specialty and reduce debt. Now we have a management team with the expertise to exploit opportunities, know when to hedge pricing and find creative ways to add value to the company. The market seems to be picking up on this change. If we can pull off the JV and split the profits from the biodiesel business, not only will we add a new revenue stream to the business but Calumet all but eliminates any future RINS obligations. That's a real game changer! This is the type of thinking we need!"
"CLMT uses some cost advantaged Canadian crude which is currently trading with over a $50/bbl discount to WTI.FYI:Bloomberg---Western Canadian Select @$16-------- Brent @ $81--The drop has come as rising production from Canada’s oil-sands overwhelms the nation’s pipeline capacity, and as refinery capacity in the U.S. dwindles amid planned maintenance.WCS has now declined for 10 of the past 13 trading days, sending its discount to West Texas Intermediate crude to $52 a barrel, the widest on record in Bloomberg data stretching back to 2008.The situation worsened on Tuesday when a natural gas pipeline in British Columbia ruptured, forcing Washington oil refineries that are major buyers of Canadian crude to curtail operations.

"Here is a comment from one analyst on the Q2 EPS. Yahoo! won't let me post the news in its entirety for whatever reason today, but thought I would share this sentence. ""CLMT reports Q2 EPS of $0.21 vs $0.10, beating the S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate by $0.24, driven by operational improvements at the Shreveport and San Antonio refineries, allowing for increased production capacity and increased margin capture, as well a continued reduction in Calumet's transportation costs."
"Up until this point the decline has been slow and steady,But see my post about marking the date as the sell off has surprised even me…Where are all the hypsters?You know, a double, a triple,??One thing for sure, investor law suits coming over this one !You think there are still paring the list of JV partners?

"Tuning out Go Slow, at some point we have to start taking this downside move seriously. Crude prices are on a slide and the sell off on this stock is coming along with higher volume. Any upside here has to be related to the JV. I thought at one point $10 pps on that announcement was feasible, but now I'm not sure sure. Is $7.50 the ceiling? I'm neutral to bearish."
Revised K1 since earnings are being restated?
"One of the tells about the bogus RND project is management posting “the greatness” of the project to the public.Why?Cause there aren’t any buyersNormally, these deals are announced after negotiations have concluded and there is a real plan.See it for what it is…When they call names, they got nothing"
2019 Pattern to Repeat? Last year CLMT more than doubled from this point through August of 2019. There are a lot of reasons why this could happen again. I increased my position this morning to take advantage of what should be a decent year. More than likely Great Falls is sold and we convert to a “C” Corp. Company has made it known that they are going to put more emphasis on their top line now that our house is mostly in order. Happy New Year Everyone!
0.23 EPS. 0.55 Adjusted EPS. Around 156 mil in cash.
"In the past Calumet has announced dividends on the 1st of Sept, Dec etc payable on the 30th or 31st of the month. In a week we'll be at September 1st. With 153.5mil in cash an increase in accounts receivable of 60mil since Dec31st, you'd think Calumet management might consider a one time dividend of .46/share. This would mean a payout of about 33mil. Representing a small reward for 21/2 years without any dividends."
"Q3 was a bit disappointing based on expectations, but not bad too bad considering. First, they had $10MM in special charges (i.e. $6MM in ERP implementation expense, $2MM in M&A transaction expense (asset sales), and $2MM in realized hedging losses). Had this not been incurred, adjusted EBITDA would have been the $106MM or the best Q in since Q1 of 2015. Then they also had another $10MM reduction to earnings from unrealized hedging losses. This roughly offsets the favorable LCM adjustments, so I'll just call it a wash from the big commodity price moves due to Harvey at quarter's end. I was trying to figure out why the $6 improvement in their benchmark 2-1-1 only resulted in a couple of dollars improvement in their fuel product margin. Some is explained from the hedging losses, and it appears to me there was an adjustment in the CL-RINs obligation market adjustment for the liability carried forward from Q2 (up $15MM, but I couldn't determine this with any certainty. So although they had some hedging losses now, they took advantage of the big prices moves to lock in the big margins over the winter months. At these levels, it is doubtful we would see further hedging losses, but more likely hedging gains in Q4 and Q1 -18. Additionally, they stated significant specialty product revenue had been deferred into Q4. So all-in-all, I would expect Q4 to be better than what otherwise and in all likelihood, another decent quarter, say something like Q1. Anyway, huge volume today, over 3 million, with a strong rebound from the lows, was encouraging, and indicates to me that institutions are supporting this stock. I am looking forward to continued improvement in 2018 with huge debt reductions, continued earnings improvement, and eventually, the reinstatement of the dividend. GL longs."
"Curious for the board thoughts on actually being able to sell GF refinery. Shell appears to have just closed 240K barrels refinery in LA after trying to sell for months/years and if I'm not mistaken there are a few other refineries that are for sale for the right price, which is apparently $1 and being released from future liabilities. Is this becoming hope instead of reality for this market?"
Good article posted on Seeking Alpha. Places a hypothetical value on what CLMT shares would be worth in five years if they sell one or more of their business segments.

"So if the JV is going to infuse the company with $300M - why not gobble up half the float and be a 50% owner in the whole enterprise, not just Montana? Maybe that explains what we are seeing today?!"

"Think about this…the way they structured this deal….the JV is the RND Project only…the remaining 12 MB/D Asphalt topping Refinery will remain with CLMTBut, of course, the RND Project is INSIDE the RefineryDependent upon it for utilities, waste water, tank farms, racks and the like.So the JV partner…risks it all of a functions 12 MB/D, money losing Asphalt Refinery?A chain is only as strong as the weakest link…Ahhhhh…..NO!"
BTWThe Exxon RND is in the same markets as Great Falls….and is pipeline connected to Calgary…there goes the local product marketsBoom
I'm holding 7K Shares at $3.25 .... Any opinions on how high this can go .... Should I sell now !
"With one half of estimated JV EBITDA now at $175 M, I would not be surprised if CLMT is holding out for 3x EBITDA which would be $525M from JV partner."
"Why doesn’t someone post something on topic?Not a single analyst rates CLMT a buyThey are either neutral or sellNo buyer for the refineryNo JV PartnerSecrecy for 8 monthsNo feedstockNo Engineering ContractorNo source of fundingBonds coming due 100 days, very little cash on handIDA devastates LouisianaCome On…All true"
Ribbon cutting making it go up 7%? Strange!
"Some have suggested the Heritage Group may be the JV partner and pointing out the have several members on the Calumet Board.Well that seems to me to be a huge conflict of interest. Right?No, we must rule out help from the Heritage Group to protect Calumet ShareholdersUGH….the share price hit $6.32 today"
Bingo now mention distribution coming
"Couple of things. I reviewed HFC's Q1 report. On page 30, they discuss the arbitration with CLMT in that the April meeting was held and they expect the arbitration panel's decision in August. CLMT has asked for reimbursement of $20MM on an indemnification agreement for environmental clean up connected to the sale of the Great Falls refinery. I expect that CLMT will prevail to some degree, but the amount is unknown. HFC reflects that they have accrued an amount for this liability, but are purposely vague on the accrued amount. Next, company indicates they did not get a decision from the EPA on their small refinery exemption request from RINs in Q1. However, they do expect this in Q2. Since the price of RINs is about 15-16 cents, it appears this would be about $8-10MM. I think this was more than triple last year. Anyway, this would be the elimination of an accrued liability. Lastly, in the earnings call, it was evident company want's to be below 4.0x Net LT debt/adj ebitda. Net debt is LT debt minus cash/adj EBITDA. This can be accomplished with debt of $1,400 - 150 cash/trailing 12 months (TTM) of $320M. Gaining $35MM/quarter on reducing net debt like last Q, and raising the TTM adjusted EBITDA up to $320MM is not that far away. I believe the income number can be hit after Q4 and so, it is a matter of getting the debt reduced $160MM, now $145MM after another $25MM purchased after quarter end. However, I still would like to see them reduce the share count 10-15MM to make it easier to pay larger dividends once they re-initiate them. So, I am thinking after the 2021 debt refinance is done, and possibly after Q2 2020, but more likely Q3 2020. But it depends on the progress over this summer. If they have a couple big quarters this summer, it could be even sooner. Hope they get the $20MM from HFC. GL longs"
Some interesting points from the earnings call. $70M of 2022 notes. paid off $80M balance remains. $37M of revolver paid off. JV will not include traditional crude refining portion of Great Falls that remains after partial renewable conversion. Estimated EBITDA for JV is now $350M and they claim it is still on track.
"CVRR declared a distribution today, for the first time since Nov 2015. CVRR is a decent indicator for CLMT, and IF CLMT also declares a distribution, you can expect unit prices in the $12 range."
up over 5% on 140K volume - who's pushing the buttons on this stock price action anyway?
My barber told me that CVRR and CLMT are going to merge and their stock is going to go up $.03!
Did you see where Exxon announced a 40 MB/D RND project to run on Canola Oil in 2025There goes the low cost feed stock supply…Death Blow for the JV
"Could be nothing at all. I've read that when institutions sell they care little about price and just want to clean the books; very unlike the small investor. ""Just get rid of it"" would be the mantra. And then the drop scares others and there is a snowball. I bought more today near the low."
"Hello - SEC filing shows ""After giving effect to the Redemption and the financing thereof, the Partnership estimates its interest expense will be approximately $138.3 million per year, assuming no further changes to its capital structure and based on the current interest rate of 3.69% that is applicable to LIBOR loans under its credit facility. In comparison, the Partnership’s reported interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $155.5 million"", can this mean the blend of rates and principal outstanding is actually an $18M savings with the new notes? Perhaps we get a bump if this is correct and gets digested as such by the market."
"Just a wild thought: Is it possible that the SAP blunder underestimated CLMT performance over the last few qtrs. and now that the software is working (more or less), it will show unusually good results this coming qtr? This might be the reason for Go and Griffin buying up the stock. Comments?"
This low volume is very telling…No buyers for this fake project at this levelAs @anonymous would say The change in Macro economic conditions and the consolidation around the Fed action will determine the fate of the bear trap….What a Joke
"So the path forward seems clear…CLMT does all the RND prep, finds a secret JVDeclares Bankruptcy - Taking the shareholders and bond holders with themEmerges from Bankruptcy, with the RND project intact and debt eliminated.Trumpian economicsTo my friends on this board Protect yourselfRemember I was right months ago no JV partnerI was right when I predicted a horrible 2Q with no JV partner announcedNow, they say, “we’ll announce the JV partner when we’re ready”Exactly….too late for us"
Seems like Jennifer has struck again. Destroying shareholder value. I feel bad for Steve. The family is ruining his ability to get things done.
"Shout out to our new CEO, Steve Mawer, for giving unit holders an update on current business conditions. People always fear the worst when there is no comment in a market that has been promoted as challenging to say the least for oil companies. This update was a pleasant surprise and gives us a lot more confidence in the company’s outlook."
"It’s that time again, so thought I would share what I am seeing for the upcoming Q1 release. First, for the Specialty division, my adjustments from Q1-18 and Q4-18 reflect an adjusted EBITDA range of $64MM and $57MM, respectively. As Q4 is typically the weakest seasonal Q for Specialty, I am inclined to lean towards the Q1 number as being the more reliable of the two. Nevertheless, I settled for the average of the two @ $60MM.For Fuels, the Q4-18 comparison had excessive adjustments as the WCS and WTI Midland discounts narrowed considerably during Q4. As a result, reliability from the Q4 comparison is believed to be somewhat diminished. That said, the adjustments, net of the hedging activity, indicates Adj. EBITDA of roughly $20MM from this division. Continuing, a comparison against Q1-18, which had much smaller adjustments, resulted in an Adj. EBITDA a touch over $40MM. Hopefully, this will prove to be a more reliable number. For the quarter, the gulf coast WTI 2-1-1 was $17.00 or about $1 higher than Q1-2018, and the WTI-Midland discount was similar. However, a substantial adjustment was still required for a lesser WCS discount, and a positive volume adjustment for less turnaround activity. As a check, a simple net refining margin of $5/bl at 75,000 bpd is roughly $34MM. Without the turnaround activity, and hedges in place for Q1, this appears achievable. That said, I have selected $30MM for fuels, which is the average of the two quarterly comparisons.All things considered; I have estimated a lofty $90MM in adjusted EBITDA before non-cash/unusual adjustments. This would be an excellent start to the year heading into the cyclically stronger Q2 & Q3 quarters. For Q2, it should be noted that the WTI-Midland discount has widened back out to the $3-5 range and the WCS discount is back over $12/bbl. Also, as of the 5/6/19 close, the GC WTI 2-1-1 was a strong $22.75 based on the EIA info. This is well above the Q1 avg, so even though we are just short of the half way point, Q2 is looking pretty good so far. GL longs."
I believe one of the creditors deadlines (Macquarie) Dec 15 has not been extended as of yet.....so if nothing else hits the fan earnings should be released this week.
Cutting ribbon without a JV? Must be some sort of silent partner or there isn’t a JV.
what happened at 2:40
Without a JV…CLMT can’t pull this project offIt is really that simpleAnd no project means no CLMTSo the strategy is clear for the right investor…buy the whole thing at a fire sale price….CLMT not neededLeave CLMT stockholders holding the bag
"I don't see much risk in 2021, no debt due until 2022 and then only $150M. I see upside with potential GF and fuels sale."
I think within 60 days we will the JV announcement or an asset sale/ lease back to pay off the $80M 2022s due January.
over simplifying - looks like they're swapping a 7.625% obligation for one at 8.4%; but extending the maturity.
Did not think we'd ever have the chance to acquire at this price again without a major market correction Need to wait till Friday
"We all know that normal tracking of projects report % complete in engineering and % complete on constructionThey got nothingNo wonder they don’t have a JV…I’m not experienced in projects, but even I can see thru the smoke screen"
Other Companies In This Spectrum Have Been Doing Great! Go's Got To Go! IMO
Nice run today. Any thoughts of future catalysts for the stock? Highly leveraged but moving towards more specialty chemicals (higher margins). Seems new management is good.
"Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P is up 6.75% to 6.80"
"As a long time shareholder, I am very happy and excited to see some clear direction and strategic initiates taking place with CLMT. Can the new MGT team execute? I think so. I think they will do well and get a lot of this debt paid down. I believe we end up with a very strong and sustainable company in about 1 yrs. time from now with very little debt. Maybe even get the dividend restored at that time. Time to start paying the shareholders and not the not the bond holders. Get the bonds called and move the cash flow this way."
"Like most of you I have been curious about how the improvement of the SAP implementation is going. I was told over the weekend there is still room for improvement but it's far better than when it was launched. Those that have been worried about the top line numbers should be (dare I say) pleased to know that in the beginning many orders were being botched which was not helping the numbers. I won't go into any more detail than that for the sake of this thread is to be positive and say it appears things are improving which is what we all want to hear. Also, after a quick google search I found a very long and detailed job search for the position of Senior SAP ABAP Developer. Anyone who can check off the laundry list of requirements should be a major asset to CLMT and improving the ERP. https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/indianapolis-in-senior-abap-developer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,15_IC1145013_KO16,37.htm?src=GD_JOB_AD&t=EMPLOYER_SEARCH_RESULTS&ao=25074&s=21&rdserp=true&srs=EI_JOBS&jl=2931921423"
At least they had enough sense to make the 2nd delay announcement on a late afternoon Friday to help minimize the volatility.

a $.97 loss and they were supposed to break even?
So look it…Calumet had 150 MM$ in bonds coming due January 15th 2022….that’s 6 months from now…We need 200 MM$ for the RND Project in April 2022Then we need 350 MM$ in bonds due January 15th 2023So that’s 650 MM$ in 18 monthsThe JV partner knows all of this….Why wouldn’t they just wait and pick these assets up out of BKRPT?So ….they go slow
"Groundhog day....CLMT : Calumet Specialty Products files to delay 10-Q8:58 am, Fri, May 11, 2018"
"GoSlow has posted hundreds of ""Short and Distort"" type comments on Calumet... and nothing on anything else. That alone shows that he has no purpose other than to create FUD for his short position which is going down in flames. Only panicky shorts that are in deep trouble post this much BS. Ignore all of his noise."
Posted on the Seeking Alpha Board. https://helenair.com/news/local/calumet-to-tap-into-renewable-diesel-fuels-with-200m-project/article_a305aaec-50b5-58a1-8750-8c4d15a5b5cb.html
"A couple thoughts on Q2. What could have been. Fuels had adjusted EBITDA of $2MM. This included a negative non-cash mark to market expense on RINs of $23MM (now $59MM). Otherwise fuels would have reflected a nice quarter. The company estimates their RIN obligation to be 80 million units/yr. They do apply for small refinery waiver for GF and have received them in the past, but these can come over a year after the compliance year. In the end, they may not need to purchase of majority of these credits, but in the interim, their income statement is exposed to another commodity price risk they could easily reduce exposure to. At year-end, Ethanol RINs were at 12 cents, and biodiesel was 50 cents. At 6/30/20, they were 45 cents, and 56 cents, respectively. So my question is, why didn’t they buy their ethanal RINs for their remaining past and 2020 obligations at year-end 2019 when they were cheap. If they get the waiver, they could sell them at what hopefully would be a profit, but if they dipped below 12 cents (unlikely), a small loss. Biodiesel RINs dipped to 45 cents at 3/31/20, but have been in a relatively modest range, but even so, they could have bought a portion of these as well to limit exposure. Next, crude experienced an incredible price drop late Q1 and early Q2. WTI was in the teens and low 20’s and WCS was even lower. In May, after the initial shock, they still could have forward purchased at least ½ of their WTI needs through the end of the year in the mid 20’s against their natural hedge of specialty product prices, and locked-in huge margins for the rest of the year. What did mgmt/board think was going to happen to crude prices when companies were shutting in wells, drilling stopped, OPEC curtailed production, and the economy was set to reopen? Had they gambled just a bit, they could have been looking at huge excess CF to accelerate the deleveraging process. I know this is a new management team, but it appears to be a huge missed opportunity. It should be noted that they did do this a few years back, so it would not have been an unprecedented move. On the plus side, they are making progress growing the Tru-fuel line, reducing SG&A expenses (notably the closure and move of the NJ facility production to other locations), and working towards the GF sale. However, this deleveraging process continues to be painfully slow. Anyway, just wanted to vent and GL."
"What am l missing??this is a good company, that has turned the corner, oil prices steady, up dramatically since the low"
Technically this is bullish but I wonder how valuable technical analysis is on stocks with such low volume. Any opinions?
"Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. Announces Strategic Divestiture of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, LLCCalumet to retain strategic investment stake in Fluid Holding Corp., the parent company of Q'Max Solutions, Inc.Nov 21, 2017INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: CLMT) (the ""Partnership,"" ""Calumet,"" ""we,"" ""our"" or ""us""), a leading independent producer of specialty hydrocarbon and fuels products, today announced that it closed on the sale of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, LLC (""Anchor Drilling Fluids"") to Q'Max America Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Q'Max Solutions Inc.

I now think that there is little doubt that they will reinstate the distribution in November.
"Anyone hear the CFO say they have continued to pay the high cost of CLMT debt, while waiting to the right time to refinance the debt stack.Waiting to refinance? This is our money he plays withWe didn’t invest in a casinoSeriously?"
I’m going slow on the JV….how is it supposed to work? The JV partner gives Calumet money so they can delver their balance sheet? Who pays for the project? When does the project start?
Special Dividend? What is the chance they will announce a special dividend on earnings??
So…no JV and more 12% bonds?
Price action indicates that CLMT could declare a distribution this quarter instead of next quarter. At a minimum they must have called the 11.5% notes which substantially reduces debt and paves the way for a distribution.
So consider Management UpdateNew H2 Plant start up October 2022Status: Not OrderedNew Pretreatment Plant start up November 2022Status: Not OrderedDo your own DD….Google RND pretreatment plant….UGHWinter coming…no foundations poured or set….no ground work in the winterNot happening folksNot happeningNo JV partnerPipe Dream
"I spoke at length with CLMT rep. There approach is rational and puts the company in a good sustainable profitable position. They are actively deleveraging. The 11% non-secured notes can be called after 2 years and will be. In the interim, CLMT will sell non-core assets if possible and the price is right. This is the garden variety refining that has lower margin. With those $, they will work on taking out the 2022 and 2023 notes deleveraging aggressively. When the debt/Ebitda ration hits 3, they will restart the dividend. They will only restart the dividend when they are sure that it will never need to be discontinued again. That will cause a dramatic increase in the share price. What say you?"
I have had enough of this dodo goslowslow and I will take somebody's advice here: Click!
So I keep stumbling over the idea that turning a 50’MB/D Hydrocracker into a 5 MB/D RND while cutting crude rate from 37 MB/D to 17 MB/D in Montana is a good ideaPeople say the Montana Refinery is a cash cow…this was the refinery they couldn’t sell..:Well at 17 MB/D ….the numbers are worse….Right?
Positive article on CLMT at Seeking Alpha today.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4113840-calumets-big-quarter
Refining margins will be significantly higher in Q2 vs Q1. Chicago crack spread at $24 is near a four year high and twice the spread during the Q1 low.

I wonder how the current price of oil will effect a buyers decision to obtain GF refinery?

Ribbon cutting with MT governor at GF refinery as first renewable feed stock is delivered. They certainly act like JV is going forward...
Last thought ….Calumet has said they were looking for a RND feedstock supplier as a JV partner.So ask yourself….why would a feedstock supplier partner with a RND project when they can sell everything to the highest bidder and capture the lion share of the RND opportunity I’m sorry to say CLMT rushed into this idea and now have bet the company on an impossible dream.The weather and the pandemic has sealed their fate.If you’re going to hold the stockBuy $6 puts at least
Seems to be holding it's own in this rather sleepy summer market.
Rhizome Partners' letter to shareholders: Very interesting reading. They exited Calumet earlier this year and admit that it was a mistake because clmt is a few months away from the sale of their Montana refinery (GF?) thereby lowering debt. The letter declines to explain the details but promised to follow up later this year on the subject.
Nice start to the new year (relative to market)...so far so good!
What is JV?
Street estimate is 14 cents for 4QTR18. Anybody here for a beat?
"Just listened to the call. Management is optimistic going forward. Crack margins have improved, Speciality is doing great. Great Falls joint venture formation will happen this year and will result in a cash infusion to company. GF transition to half biodiesel will start before end of year and be fully operation within 12 months. GF will generate huge RIN credits."
"So I was doing a little math…..What I got out of Phase 1 was that Calumet plans to process 5000 B/D of RND before running out of Hydrogen.Then, up to 12,000 B/D once they build a new H2 Plant… That’s a 150% increase in needed Hydrogen….no small plant.When you add 150% more H2 into a H/C, I’m only guessing the heat release alone will be tremendous.This is not simple, despite the existing metallurgy being okay…pumps, exchangers, instrumentation will need to be redesigned.Who is doing the engineering?Well, volume is up today and price is down….maybe some bashers are loading up….let’s hope so…it lets us out!"
"So a big part of the viability of the project is canola oil….that is not currently being grown, processed and oil produced and needs capital to do so…Here is a link on how canola is transformed into oilhttps://www.canolacouncil.org/about-canola/processing/Are they going to be able to transform and grow the canola farming business to support their RND project?Ahhhh….noEven if they could, it won’t be up and running for years.This whole project requires preinvestment to be viableFor this….they sacrifice a 35 B/D cash cow? Not happening guys"
Another week of silence on the JV statusHonestly I don’t know anything about the JV status….but I am willing to admit the secrecy is telling
Institutional ownership % almost doubled
Nice to see price over $7 again. Let's get the JV finalized!
"What are your Pros and Cons to the S-8 filing besides dilution? I have seen how many long overtime hours the engineers have put into maintenance and turn around. They deserve to be rewarded as much as us, and it only makes sense to do so before the distribution is announced. If you told me that 2,000,000 shares is too many for who deserves the compensation then I could go along with that, but like I said I don’t mind rewarding and giving further incentive to those who are grinding for us to get a distribution reinstated."
Wouldn't surprised if we see another SEC Form 4 filed today or tomorrow from T. Go and/or W. Griffin. This seems to be the price where they've been buying.
7% increase. What's going on?

Wow 130K shares traded that last 10 minutes.
My gut tells me the JV is with the Heritage Group. The folks who run the show here. Steve knows how #$%$ a deal it was for CLMT so he doesn?t want to admit it publicly.
CEO Tim Go purchased (3 separate transactions) 3000 shares of CLMT this last week
Paid off $450M in debt this quarter including penalties on the early payment of notes.$0.45/unit in Distributable Cash Flow so they can pay the minimum distribution of 45 cents out of DCF if they choose.This was the last quarter with expenses directly related to previous management's bad decisions on expansion.
