"Couple of things. I reviewed HFC's Q1 report. On page 30, they discuss the arbitration with CLMT in that the April meeting was held and they expect the arbitration panel's decision in August. CLMT has asked for reimbursement of $20MM on an indemnification agreement for environmental clean up connected to the sale of the Great Falls refinery. I expect that CLMT will prevail to some degree, but the amount is unknown. HFC reflects that they have accrued an amount for this liability, but are purposely vague on the accrued amount. Next, company indicates they did not get a decision from the EPA on their small refinery exemption request from RINs in Q1. However, they do expect this in Q2. Since the price of RINs is about 15-16 cents, it appears this would be about $8-10MM. I think this was more than triple last year. Anyway, this would be the elimination of an accrued liability. Lastly, in the earnings call, it was evident company want's to be below 4.0x Net LT debt/adj ebitda. Net debt is LT debt minus cash/adj EBITDA. This can be accomplished with debt of $1,400 - 150 cash/trailing 12 months (TTM) of $320M. Gaining $35MM/quarter on reducing net debt like last Q, and raising the TTM adjusted EBITDA up to $320MM is not that far away. I believe the income number can be hit after Q4 and so, it is a matter of getting the debt reduced $160MM, now $145MM after another $25MM purchased after quarter end. However, I still would like to see them reduce the share count 10-15MM to make it easier to pay larger dividends once they re-initiate them. So, I am thinking after the 2021 debt refinance is done, and possibly after Q2 2020, but more likely Q3 2020. But it depends on the progress over this summer. If they have a couple big quarters this summer, it could be even sooner. Hope they get the $20MM from HFC. GL longs"

"This just in:Calumet CFO Griffin to depart; launches $550M bond offeringSep. 20, 2019 8:47 AM ET|About: Calumet Specialty Products ... (CLMT)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor Calumet Specialty Products Partners (NASDAQ:CLMT) says CFO West Griffin will be leaving the position by the end of this year and is nearing the conclusion of a search process for a new CFO.Griffin joined CLMT as executive VP and CFO in early 2017; he had been a founder and CFO of Energy XXI Ltd.CLMT also says it will offer a $550M private placement of senior notes due 2025, and plans to use proceeds, together with borrowings under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all outstanding 6.50% senior notes due 2021."
"I don't see much risk in 2021, no debt due until 2022 and then only $150M. I see upside with potential GF and fuels sale."
"As a long time shareholder, I am very happy and excited to see some clear direction and strategic initiates taking place with CLMT. Can the new MGT team execute? I think so. I think they will do well and get a lot of this debt paid down. I believe we end up with a very strong and sustainable company in about 1 yrs. time from now with very little debt. Maybe even get the dividend restored at that time. Time to start paying the shareholders and not the not the bond holders. Get the bonds called and move the cash flow this way."
what happened at 2:40
I'm holding 7K Shares at $3.25 ... I was going to sell yesterday ... But didn't !Should I hold on for a better price or sell now ?Call Options ?What to do ... What to do ....
Some interesting points from the earnings call. $70M of 2022 notes. paid off $80M balance remains. $37M of revolver paid off. JV will not include traditional crude refining portion of Great Falls that remains after partial renewable conversion. Estimated EBITDA for JV is now $350M and they claim it is still on track.
321 crack spread. still moving up now $13.89. 1rst qtr 21 might be good for GF refinery cash flow.
"I spoke at length with CLMT rep. There approach is rational and puts the company in a good sustainable profitable position. They are actively deleveraging. The 11% non-secured notes can be called after 2 years and will be. In the interim, CLMT will sell non-core assets if possible and the price is right. This is the garden variety refining that has lower margin. With those $, they will work on taking out the 2022 and 2023 notes deleveraging aggressively. When the debt/Ebitda ration hits 3, they will restart the dividend. They will only restart the dividend when they are sure that it will never need to be discontinued again. That will cause a dramatic increase in the share price. What say you?"
Without a JV…CLMT can’t pull this project offIt is really that simpleAnd no project means no CLMTSo the strategy is clear for the right investor…buy the whole thing at a fire sale price….CLMT not neededLeave CLMT stockholders holding the bag
Street estimate is 14 cents for 4QTR18. Anybody here for a beat?
"It is quite possible for GoSlow to be stirring the pot AND to have an excellent point. This is a sleepy, sleepy stock. Exceedingly low volume. Tough to get a handle on direction though appears to be leaking pps. Another big earnings miss and no JV news will plunge this into the $5s. Good luck to all."
Just spoke with IR. There should be an announcement within the next 2 days. Earnings call will follow in the first two weeks of March.
"I Spoke with Jeff from IR (312) 445-2870 and expressed my concern for the companies silence on earnings. I told him am a long-term investor which I am and that I'm concerned that there may be something nefarious the company is telling us. He said they are shooting for a March 10th earnings release, and a press release should be going out in 2 -3 days tops. When I expressed my concern an investor, I told him wanted to be sure the company is not having more problems adjusting to the new ERP. He assured me that they aren't, but that they want to make sure they don't run into the same accounting problem as last time which is why they are airing on caution for an earlier than necessary earnings release. I told him the stock price keeps deteriorating due to the companies silence and hope that the CEO is aware. He pointed out that the stock is up a nickel.....I said seriously?????? It's down from 9.90 more than just a nickel, but l am glad he sees that as a positive move in the right direction."
Cutting ribbon without a JV? Must be some sort of silent partner or there isn’t a JV.
"What am l missing??this is a good company, that has turned the corner, oil prices steady, up dramatically since the low"
My gut tells me the JV is with the Heritage Group. The folks who run the show here. Steve knows how #$%$ a deal it was for CLMT so he doesn?t want to admit it publicly.
"If you look at page 16 of today’s BofA presentation, you will see that they upped their EBITDA guidance from $175 million to 240 million for the Montana Renewable Diesel venture."
Can we skip buying the stock and still get the Grapes and Super Models
"Alright, I see by their presentation they increased their locked in WCS position to 40% of total WCS needs for the entire year of 2019. The WCS differential increased by 4,000 BPD to 5,000 BPD for 2019 @ $33.96/barrel. This joins their previously hedged ULSD crack at 72.1% margin. OUTSTANDING. For Q1 & Q2, they also have 40% of WTI-Midland needs locked in @ $12.79 & $11.74 differential discounts, respectively. Again, this is great. The presentation indicates Specialty is off to a strong start for Q1. We could see a really nice run into the Q1 report in May. GL longs."
Any comments on Rhyzome Partners pulling out of clmt and their observations about their mistaken investment?IMO a lot of truth about what they said.
Predictable pullback. Perhaps another buying opportunity ?? Thoughts ?
Does anyone think we will hear about distribution in the near future? As in a mention during next CC.
In a year... those of us with 20000+ shares are going to be eating grapes and dating Brazilian super models.
I think within 60 days we will the JV announcement or an asset sale/ lease back to pay off the $80M 2022s due January.
"Here is a statement from the q2 19 10K for Calumet; •Environmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the cost of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). To the extent we are unable to blend biofuels, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our annual requirement. The approximate 80% increase in the price of RINs during the second quarter 2019 unfavorably affected our results of operations. It is not possible to predict what future RINs volumes or costs may be given the volatile price of RINs, but we continue to anticipate that RINs have the potential to remain a significant expense for our fuel products segment (inclusive of the favorable impact of exemptions received), assuming current market prices for RINs continue. While we applied for RINs exemptions, we have not learned whether we will receive any exemptions in 2019 for the 2018 operating year. In the details of this 10K it states that for Q2 19 RINS were worth 21mil and that for Q1 19 12mil. Or about 17mil for an average. Mr. Go said that the company expects to get word that their partition to suspend RINs was expected to be approved in the next 3-4 weeks. This should result in an expense savings of about 10mil for Q3 19. Given that and a strong Q2 19 report, why has the price of Calumets stock gone down 20% since earnings were announced?"
"I find it odd that people whine on this post about lack of transparency and management compensation packages. This is an MLP, you basically have LITTLE to NO say about anything....its not common stock. If you want those things invest your money elsewhere. I wake up every day hoping this thing goes down in price so I can by more knowing that the reward will only come when distributions return. Then and only then will the units be worth what they should be based on yield to risk. As far as information...read the annual reports and filings....COVER TO COVER, all your questions will be answered and then some."

Paid off $450M in debt this quarter including penalties on the early payment of notes.$0.45/unit in Distributable Cash Flow so they can pay the minimum distribution of 45 cents out of DCF if they choose.This was the last quarter with expenses directly related to previous management's bad decisions on expansion.
"This looks like a good time to buy to me. If you really look at the quarter, it wasn't that bad. The company shows a $60MM adjusted EBITDA when added back in the LCM inventory adjustment of 2.3MM, $3MM of ERP expense, an .3MM realized derivatives loss. However, they don't add back in the $9.4MM non-cash expense for the mark-to-market provision of the inventory financing agreement. Adding this back gives them $69MM in adjusted EBITDA. The presentation (page 18) shows $20MM cash from operations reflecting $10MM for distributable cash calc in the pres release plus the $9.4MM non-cash mark. Also, they appear to have substantially completed the heavy turnarounds with Great Falls and Princeton completed this Q. Therefore, the earnings are absent 30 days plus of revenues this Q from these two facilities and reconciling the Q2 and Q3 account differences indicates they also expensed $13MM of the $21MM in the Q3 cap-expenditures this Q. So w/o the heavy turnaround and M-T-M adjustments, it appears they could have achieved about $80MM in adjusted EBITDA and would have been profitable. Now we currently have a significant decline in crude prices that will result in margin improvements for the specialty products and at the same time, huge current WCS discounts > $40/barrel to WTI, and RIN costs are the lowest in years (8 cents/gallon for gas and 33 cents for ULSD). With the turnaround behind Great Falls, they should be extraordinarily profitable this Q. Also, according to the presentation (page 10), the company was able to lock in Midland to Cushing WTI discount for Q4 in excess of $15/barrel for about 12,000 barrels/day, and also locked in ULSD crack spreads at Great Falls in excess of $50/barrel. Anyway, I am thinking this is oversold and 2019 will be a better year with less maintenance. GL"
"How about some real news Calumet Management team!!! We have not heard a business update from you in a while now!!! Meanwhile, our company is losing value every day."
Just more news crossing the wires…5 of 10 Calumet Production facilities are in Louisiana and Texas…Bulls eye for Hurricane Ida…Cat 3 or higher stormSurely it won’t have any impact on operations if you listen to the hypstersJust be ready for it..:
We will be moving higher today :)
"I now think, Calumet doesn’t want any part of the RND project…they want out with the core business being specialty products.It that is true, I predict they sell the Montana refinery for about 100 MM$ and let the new owner decide on the RND project.Good luck longs"
Positive article on CLMT at Seeking Alpha today.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4113840-calumets-big-quarter
Hope the long term prediction is correct. I purchased it many years ago at $34.
Don't sell longs...our time has come!
"Refiners are killing it right now....all except this one. Any news that isn't bad will give this stock a pop. Bad news ? and it all comes down to the messaging. At a billion per quarter, even a $10 million mis-statememt (and associated fines) won't hold us back for long - provided Go amd Co are transparent and have a strong roadmap forward."
"This is wonderful news. They continue to deleverage. This takes the heat off for the next 2 years and allows them to focus on growing EBITDA by growing the specialty business. Very positive on this. Incrementally, the stock will increase as well. There will then be a sudden jump at the end of 2020."
"In the past Calumet has announced dividends on the 1st of Sept, Dec etc payable on the 30th or 31st of the month. In a week we'll be at September 1st. With 153.5mil in cash an increase in accounts receivable of 60mil since Dec31st, you'd think Calumet management might consider a one time dividend of .46/share. This would mean a payout of about 33mil. Representing a small reward for 21/2 years without any dividends."
"Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P is up 6.75% to 6.80"

"The Philly Energy Solutions refinery fire takes 335k barrels/day off line. Not sure for how long, but damage could be considerable. I see CVI is up about 4% on the news and I would expect other refiner stock to move higher over the coming days as traders realize the impact on refining margins may last for quite a while. CLMT is already having a strong Q, but with the removal of such a large refinery, I would expect refining margins to strengthen across the board as gas and diesel will be moved from other markets to compensate the lost production. At the same time, crude demand will likely fall with the reduced refinery capacity. So once the Iran tensions moderate, I would guess we will see WTI fall back some on continued inventory builds. If I remember right, we had a similar situation a couple of years back when a large refinery in the upper Midwest (Illinois, Ohio?) was taken off line for an extended period. Will see. GL"
"Today's Calumet has a whole different feel to it! Although I really liked what Tim Go did for the company, I think his main talent was to pull the reigns back in, sell off pieces of the company to focus on Specialty and reduce debt. Now we have a management team with the expertise to exploit opportunities, know when to hedge pricing and find creative ways to add value to the company. The market seems to be picking up on this change. If we can pull off the JV and split the profits from the biodiesel business, not only will we add a new revenue stream to the business but Calumet all but eliminates any future RINS obligations. That's a real game changer! This is the type of thinking we need!"
"Shout out to our new CEO, Steve Mawer, for giving unit holders an update on current business conditions. People always fear the worst when there is no comment in a market that has been promoted as challenging to say the least for oil companies. This update was a pleasant surprise and gives us a lot more confidence in the company’s outlook."
"Could be nothing at all. I've read that when institutions sell they care little about price and just want to clean the books; very unlike the small investor. ""Just get rid of it"" would be the mantra. And then the drop scares others and there is a snowball. I bought more today near the low."
Why the 3% Increase today ???
"CLMT has lost one third of it's value since the first of June. With positive FCF, no debt payments due in 2020 and 2021, the possible sale of a major refinery (GF) and the possibility of restarting distributions, you'd think this stock would be approaching $4 not $2. Maybe this will change whenQ4 results are posted in August or September."
"Reversion to the mean - $5.50 looks to be the support. The accumulation is real at this level. Look for a breakout of the $XOP in the weeks to come, this should translate to higher highs for us longs. Looking forward to the ride in the month of May "
"A couple thoughts on Q2. What could have been. Fuels had adjusted EBITDA of $2MM. This included a negative non-cash mark to market expense on RINs of $23MM (now $59MM). Otherwise fuels would have reflected a nice quarter. The company estimates their RIN obligation to be 80 million units/yr. They do apply for small refinery waiver for GF and have received them in the past, but these can come over a year after the compliance year. In the end, they may not need to purchase of majority of these credits, but in the interim, their income statement is exposed to another commodity price risk they could easily reduce exposure to. At year-end, Ethanol RINs were at 12 cents, and biodiesel was 50 cents. At 6/30/20, they were 45 cents, and 56 cents, respectively. So my question is, why didn’t they buy their ethanal RINs for their remaining past and 2020 obligations at year-end 2019 when they were cheap. If they get the waiver, they could sell them at what hopefully would be a profit, but if they dipped below 12 cents (unlikely), a small loss. Biodiesel RINs dipped to 45 cents at 3/31/20, but have been in a relatively modest range, but even so, they could have bought a portion of these as well to limit exposure. Next, crude experienced an incredible price drop late Q1 and early Q2. WTI was in the teens and low 20’s and WCS was even lower. In May, after the initial shock, they still could have forward purchased at least ½ of their WTI needs through the end of the year in the mid 20’s against their natural hedge of specialty product prices, and locked-in huge margins for the rest of the year. What did mgmt/board think was going to happen to crude prices when companies were shutting in wells, drilling stopped, OPEC curtailed production, and the economy was set to reopen? Had they gambled just a bit, they could have been looking at huge excess CF to accelerate the deleveraging process. I know this is a new management team, but it appears to be a huge missed opportunity. It should be noted that they did do this a few years back, so it would not have been an unprecedented move. On the plus side, they are making progress growing the Tru-fuel line, reducing SG&A expenses (notably the closure and move of the NJ facility production to other locations), and working towards the GF sale. However, this deleveraging process continues to be painfully slow. Anyway, just wanted to vent and GL."
"Just a couple of thoughts on the stock purchases of T. Go and W. Griffin. The way they are purchasing keeps them from breaking any SEC rules as far insider trading, should distributions be reinstated. They were started well over a month away from any announcement and have given individual investors plenty of time to buy or sell based on their transactions. Second, distributions are announced in a 45 day window that starts with the close of the quarter, so the 45 day window starts the close of the next quarter (Sept. 30). Finally, T. Go and W. Griffin do not have a direct say when distributions will resume, that is the decision of the General Partner and it is their decision alone. (although I'm sure Go and Griffin do weigh in on those decisions).Hopefully that clears up some of the what-ifs"
"Solid quarter, sales recovered from Hurricanes, self help going along, gonna pay down some debt when feel like it, no distribution. bye.That is the earnings call in a nutshell."
Why the 4% increase today ??????

"Nice fuel hedge for Great Falls. Keeps the spreads intact through the end of 2020. There are companies are still interested in GF, even through the pandemic. Looking forward to completing the final step in our turnaround."
"CVRR declared a distribution today, for the first time since Nov 2015. CVRR is a decent indicator for CLMT, and IF CLMT also declares a distribution, you can expect unit prices in the $12 range."
Rhizome Partners' letter to shareholders: Very interesting reading. They exited Calumet earlier this year and admit that it was a mistake because clmt is a few months away from the sale of their Montana refinery (GF?) thereby lowering debt. The letter declines to explain the details but promised to follow up later this year on the subject.
"Curious for the board thoughts on actually being able to sell GF refinery. Shell appears to have just closed 240K barrels refinery in LA after trying to sell for months/years and if I'm not mistaken there are a few other refineries that are for sale for the right price, which is apparently $1 and being released from future liabilities. Is this becoming hope instead of reality for this market?"
"We all know that normal tracking of projects report % complete in engineering and % complete on constructionThey got nothingNo wonder they don’t have a JV…I’m not experienced in projects, but even I can see thru the smoke screen"
Anyone have any guesses when the dividend comes back and guesses of how much
"Just a wild thought: Is it possible that the SAP blunder underestimated CLMT performance over the last few qtrs. and now that the software is working (more or less), it will show unusually good results this coming qtr? This might be the reason for Go and Griffin buying up the stock. Comments?"
"Interesting situation setting up. The virus continues to drive world economy down, thus enforcing $40 barrel oil expectations. In the meantime, CLMT will announce last Qtr. earnings in a few days with this board's estimates of somewhat flat expectations. So I am thinking in the next 4 to 5 wks we are going to see a great CLMT buying opportunity. IMHO"
Personally I don't read too much into this rally. Everyone knows December is a typical sell off month. Share price in January 2018 was around $8 per. Then the steady decline over the year to a low of $2 in December 2018. 2018 ended the year with 1.6 billion in debt. In January 2019 SP went from 2.40 per to about $3.75 per I'm a week. That's a 56% increase. So this January 2020 run up of $.70 per has precedent. The nice thing is the debt should be 400mm or thereabouts lighter in December year end earnings.
Bingo now mention distribution coming
0.23 EPS. 0.55 Adjusted EPS. Around 156 mil in cash.
It would becoming clear….No JV partner is coming in to pay down CLMT debt….so they can participate in a RND project …with a sick partnerAccording to Bruce Fleming….they structured a deal without the rest of the refinery. CLMT will end up owning all the liabilities of a 15 MB/D Asphalt refinery with HF AlkyCash Cow?Ahhhhh….no
Last thought ….Calumet has said they were looking for a RND feedstock supplier as a JV partner.So ask yourself….why would a feedstock supplier partner with a RND project when they can sell everything to the highest bidder and capture the lion share of the RND opportunity I’m sorry to say CLMT rushed into this idea and now have bet the company on an impossible dream.The weather and the pandemic has sealed their fate.If you’re going to hold the stockBuy $6 puts at least

Any guestimation on future value? Amount and when?
"In the Wells Fargo report, Roger discounts his price target 50% from $16 to $8 to account for potential execution issues. Also states there is $3 to $9 worth of upside potential not factored into his analysis depending on how the joint venture is structured. Under the most ideal scenario (unlikely) CLMT secures a JV deal and executes their plan perfectly, Roger is saying a valuation of $25 is within reach. More likely scenario is a price target of $16 to $18 in the next 18 months. I’ll take it!!!"
Ribbon cutting making it go up 7%? Strange!
Anybody hear anything on the JV?
The results they are talking about are EARNINGS READ THE RELEASE
"Up until this point the decline has been slow and steady,But see my post about marking the date as the sell off has surprised even me…Where are all the hypsters?You know, a double, a triple,??One thing for sure, investor law suits coming over this one !You think there are still paring the list of JV partners? Seriously?"
I now think that there is little doubt that they will reinstate the distribution in November.
"Think about this…the way they structured this deal….the JV is the RND Project only…the remaining 12 MB/D Asphalt topping Refinery will remain with CLMTBut, of course, the RND Project is INSIDE the RefineryDependent upon it for utilities, waste water, tank farms, racks and the like.So the JV partner…risks it all of a functions 12 MB/D, money losing Asphalt Refinery?A chain is only as strong as the weakest link…Ahhhhh…..NO!"
calumet will report 0.16 per share
So look it…Calumet had 150 MM$ in bonds coming due January 15th 2022….that’s 6 months from now…We need 200 MM$ for the RND Project in April 2022Then we need 350 MM$ in bonds due January 15th 2023So that’s 650 MM$ in 18 monthsThe JV partner knows all of this….Why wouldn’t they just wait and pick these assets up out of BKRPT?So ….they go slow
More good news! Sounds like CLMT might pay off their recently refinanced debt much sooner than we all thought.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298112-rhizome-partners-calumet-specialty-products-partners-l-p
Good article posted on Seeking Alpha. Places a hypothetical value on what CLMT shares would be worth in five years if they sell one or more of their business segments. Runs through several interesting options. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4383987-navigating-calumets-crossroads
So…no JV and more 12% bonds?
It was nice catching up with Marc tonight over some bbq ribs. He had been on a long vacation thanks to CLMT. Im hoping this upcoming earnings period will be profitable for all of us.
By 2nd Qtr 2022 we could see debt down to $900M EBITDA at $350M for a 2.57 ratio and a reinstated Qrtly distribution of 25 cents.
"Something worth mentioning IMHO. Sales volumes from a 9 months ending September both 2018 and 2019. Specialty volume up from 6,589,000bbls to 7,041,000bbls. That's a YoY improvement of 452,000bbls. Fuels had a nice volume improvement of about 2.4 million bbls. Price per bbl both dropped by ten dollars and seven dollars. That seems to be the main reason the top number seemed relatively flat. Another thing to note is packaged and synthetic products accounted for all the decline on the specialty side. Down 25 million for those 9 months YoY. These are supposedly the higher margin products so here's hoping for substantial growth in the coming quarters and years."
Holding around 8.00.......this is positive ....expect full explanation before 12/31/2017 Imo

"Tuning out Go Slow, at some point we have to start taking this downside move seriously. Crude prices are on a slide and the sell off on this stock is coming along with higher volume. Any upside here has to be related to the JV. I thought at one point $10 pps on that announcement was feasible, but now I'm not sure sure. Is $7.50 the ceiling? I'm neutral to bearish."
Why are Steve and Anynonomous covering for management?They got nothing on topic
"One would like to think that, at SOME point, losing 50% of your valuation in months would spur the board to action. Especially in what's been a boon for refiners, losing this much demonstrates the market's clear loss of confidence in Go and his team. As I've said, they have gotten us through the tough times but have given us no evidence that they are truly visionary and growth minded. You can cut expenses and efficiency your way to prosperity. With that said, I still have faith that the company, at its core, has a strong and enduring business model. We just need better and more vocal leadership. BTW... wouldn't a decline in this much of valuation adversely affect their leverage ratio ? smh..."
"Thought I would wait until February to load up, but the unit price got so low the last week or two, I couldn't resist accumulating a position. Well low share price & the fact WTI has dropped about $25/barrel during Q4. Company is now weighted towards Specialty Products, and the lower crude price translates to margin improvement on about 25K barrels/day for that division. For the quarter, the WTI average was about $10/barrel lower. If product pricing remained the same, that would translate to $22.5 million EBITDA improvement from that division, but as Q4 is typically a weaker demand Q, it will likely be a bit less than that, but should still be much improved. The improvement should more than offset expected refining margin compression. Regardless, I am most interested in Q1 and Q2. Even if WTI modestly rises each month back to $60 by summer, Q1 and Q2 should be very good performers, especially when coupled with the lighter turnaround maintenance schedule. Looking forward to 2019."
Nice start to the new year (relative to market)...so far so good!
"If they sell Great Falls for 450 million, it would have about 800 million of debt and the current market cap is about 200 million, so the total enterprise value of 1 billion. If they do 225 million of EBITDA EBITDA GF sale and get the multiple of 8X, which is what BP sold a commodity chemical business for two months ago, the enterprise value should be around 1.8 billion. That would indicate a share price around 12 bucks give or take."
What’s the spike for
"Great quarter all around, and retired debt. Lets see where we go today."
"It's a long ways off in terms of boosting the company's bottom line, but have you guys considered the impact from their renewables purchase? The New Green Deal is an absolute joke, but that doesn't mean there won't be massive opportunities in that space. If I recall, a lot of the new focus with CLMT's new testing complex are things like 'green friendly' lubricants. It probably won't provide any decent ROI for at least three years, but IMO, that's where a lot of CLMT's new growth will come from. Anyone banking on near term dividends should have bailed a long time ago. IF and when, CLMT does decide to resume distributions, they are going to be overly conservative with them. It's going to be something small, and they will focus on growing it, not paying out the high rates they used to."
up over 5% on 140K volume - who's pushing the buttons on this stock price action anyway?
Special Dividend? What is the chance they will announce a special dividend on earnings??
IMHO company is not selling packaged fuels/lub business. Rumors of this were due to the fuel terminals sale/ lease back they were cooking up. Plan is still to sale GF refinery. GF should be producing cash 321 crack spread is holding steady currently 13.23.
I'm holding 7K Shares at $3.25 .... Any opinions on how high this can go .... Should I sell now !
ESG REVOLUTION!!! 
Tim Go and team have excited the institutional investors with their attendance at recent conferences. Im expecting big things between now and earnings in early August. Im loading up so i can sit back and collect a quarterly distribution in the near future.
"Groundhog day....CLMT : Calumet Specialty Products files to delay 10-Q8:58 am, Fri, May 11, 2018"
"Alberta has dropped production limits. The wti/wcs diff should widen. Good for GF, maybe we get a sale before the end of the year."
"Like most of you I have been curious about how the improvement of the SAP implementation is going. I was told over the weekend there is still room for improvement but it's far better than when it was launched. Those that have been worried about the top line numbers should be (dare I say) pleased to know that in the beginning many orders were being botched which was not helping the numbers. I won't go into any more detail than that for the sake of this thread is to be positive and say it appears things are improving which is what we all want to hear. Also, after a quick google search I found a very long and detailed job search for the position of Senior SAP ABAP Developer. Anyone who can check off the laundry list of requirements should be a major asset to CLMT and improving the ERP. https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/indianapolis-in-senior-abap-developer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,15_IC1145013_KO16,37.htm?src=GD_JOB_AD&t=EMPLOYER_SEARCH_RESULTS&ao=25074&s=21&rdserp=true&srs=EI_JOBS&jl=2931921423"
Wish I could sell this stock but it would be too much of a loss.I have been waiting for over 8 years so far.
EBITDA has almost quadrupled since this time last year. Along with rising revenues and the shedding of some expensive assets to clear debt I expect this to be a great earnings call.

Other Companies In This Spectrum Have Been Doing Great! Go's Got To Go! IMO
"I agree. If income remains stable etc. , we are looking at potentially a pretty big upside to the stock price along with some nice distributions in 2021."
anyone else getting the feeling the JV isn't working out?
"First Call Change in Consensus Recommendations from Hold to Buy today; They also have 3 upgrades since last earning, should be in up from here. GLTA."
"There is nothing compelling about a stranded asset in MontanaThe problem for CLMT is they have bonds due and no way to pay for them.Who ever dreamt up this crazy scheme to turn a 35 MB/D cash cow into a 5MB/D RND and a 12 MB/D Asphalt topping plant ought to be fired!The fat lady is about to singThey duped us…but if you have a positive position, get out…learn"
"When a stock jumps up 4% or 5% a day for several days in a row, there's a reason. But I see nothing in the news from CLMT, no press announcements. Volume is below average, so it's not a buying frenzy. Any ideas?"
"3/24/21Wells Fargo Upgrades Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (CLMT) $8.00 Equal Weight -> Overweight"
"Anyone hear the CFO say they have continued to pay the high cost of CLMT debt, while waiting to the right time to refinance the debt stack.Waiting to refinance? This is our money he plays withWe didn’t invest in a casinoSeriously?"
"Jan 19, 2016 was the last time CLMT declared a distribution o approx. $.68/unit. That was5 years ago. At that time CLMT had a debt of $3.3 bil. Now the debt is $2.3 bil and there is a possibility that will sell one of their assets for $700mil or $500mi cutting debt by 50 or 40%. With oil approaching $50/barrel and possible triple digit FCF. It might be time that CLMT would consider restoring a modified distribution. That could happen on 1/19/21."
I wonder how the current price of oil will effect a buyers decision to obtain GF refinery?
"Scam AlertNew across the wires that CLMT has just announced the selection of Halder Topsoe as their technology vendor for the RND plantThe problem is, They have the process backwardsThe technology selection is the starting point for engineering….I’m not an engineer but I know all the balances for heat, material flows, controls, and even reactor design follow that…They haven’t even ordered the catalystThe project status of an April startup is a scamCan’t happen safely."
Picking up support Zacks and Moody like it ....just upgraded Zacks has been positive on the stock for a few months. I think we have two good quarters coming EBITA will be terrific and expect debt reduction
Seems like Jennifer has struck again. Destroying shareholder value. I feel bad for Steve. The family is ruining his ability to get things done.
"One of the tells about the bogus RND project is management posting “the greatness” of the project to the public.Why?Cause there aren’t any buyersNormally, these deals are announced after negotiations have concluded and there is a real plan.See it for what it is…When they call names, they got nothing"
Anybody see they are having a ribbon cutting ceremony today with the Governor of Montana?Yeah to celebrate the delivery of RND feedstock….Could they be any more transparently pathetic?What possible purpose does this serve other than to create a smoke screen?Let me see if I can find out how much…
"Remember months ago, I ask who is the engineering contractor and who is the construction contractor on the project?They don’t have oneSomething really shady going on…"
A pre market quote of $7.73 might mean that the JV is in play.
How about this comeback? almost back to what it was. I think we have a winner here.
"This price action is feeling like a “bull trap” I am expecting a lot of volatility between now and JV announcement - with the low float, and options contracts expiring Friday, things are going to get wild…"
"Do you remember when Calumet was trying to sell the Montana Refinery…They said then:It was crude advantaged to low cost Canadian Crude via pipeline and in PADD IV where cracked spreads were highest. Production was setting records? Cash cowThe result: No buyersSo the dreamt up the RND project which undoes all those “advantages”They now say:It’s feedstock advantaged and situated close to California?!? Ahhhhh….NoRail the feedstock in and Rail the products out….Montana is a disadvantaged locationIt’s a stranded asset, where product demand is low. Hard to operate in the winter and not a skilled work force baseWho are they kidding? Us?They put a 50 MB/D Hydrocracker in a 25 MB/D Asphalt plantPreinvestment?Ahhhhhh…..KnowMBA 101No Preinvestment"
"If they reinstate a distribution in 2020 this stock will be up to $20 (fcf, good profit margins, stable products, ). I would venture to guess that 2021 should be a very good year for investors if mgmt. can fix the problem of useless refineries bought 4-6 years ago. Looking good so far!"
Ok guys and Rachel. Let’s talk about this upcoming ER. We know they want to continue to chop away at the leverage ratio. What’s your best guess on how they will approach that and it’s effect on the EPS (as we saw last quarter)?
With this morning's price action we can now anticipate a move into the 7's.
"EBITDA of 350-400 would push the debt/ EBITDA TO 4.0 or less, Suggesting that distribution will be resumed in four or so quarters."
at this point I'm so long...any decline in price is a buying opportunity while lowering cost basis. GLTA.
"GoSlow has posted hundreds of ""Short and Distort"" type comments on Calumet... and nothing on anything else. That alone shows that he has no purpose other than to create FUD for his short position which is going down in flames. Only panicky shorts that are in deep trouble post this much BS. Ignore all of his noise."
"Go has said he prefers to focus on EBITDA so as to reduce leverage by growing the business. He has previously said debt/EBITDA Would need to be 4x or less before distributions would resume. The company is a MLP and must distribute eventually. Growth plus self help cost containment is the avenue to turnaround and is tracking nicely. There will be a distribution and not in the too-distant future. When that happens the undervalue of the stock price will reverse quickly and dramatically to something reflecting 8 percent return on investment. Stay the course, sailors!"
Get ready for a jump in the next few weeks!Moody's upgrades CLMT from caa1 to B3. Zack's rates it as a buy (no. 1)
BEARS INSIDER SELLING TODAY
Volume Strong Today. Fund managers placing their bets for 2020?
This is just starting. Street is finally seeing value in the Co. with the GF JV plan in addition to solid specialty business. Cash from JV will bring leverage down to correct levels considering the EBIDTA once JV is fully operational then distribution can be reestablished.
Has a K1 been issued for 2020?
Did not think we'd ever have the chance to acquire at this price again without a major market correction Need to wait till Friday
"2nd qtr results.. Not much new. Trying to break even with specialty products carrying the load and offset capex spending. Bottom line is that they need to unload at least GF and maybe a second fuel refinery if possible. Until then..... go back to sleep. However, if the market tanks this puppy would be a perfect buy on the chance that they will unload fuel division assets."
New to the board
"Moody's with an upgrade on Friday, not that I'd expect to see it anywhere on the negative always and forever Yahoo Boards... some good information in there about how and when to expect a distribution.https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-changes-Calumet-Specialtys-outlook-to-stable-from-negative-Caa1--PR_389383"
Revised K1 since earnings are being restated?
My barber told me that CVRR and CLMT are going to merge and their stock is going to go up $.03!
"Per the press release, it appears the company repurchased another $50MM prior to closing the new bond issue. So $140MM YTD bond repurchases from cash flow, and is trading at a market cap of < 2x free CF. This is so cheap, I wonder why the GP doesn't make a move to take it private, or at least increase their limited partner hold. Also, the Great Falls crack (diesel) is over $40/barrel with widening of the WCS spread and surging diesel prices. One day longs!"
With Free Cash Flow being 54 Mil last quarter. What's the boards guess for FCF in the 4th quarter?
"So I was doing a little math…..What I got out of Phase 1 was that Calumet plans to process 5000 B/D of RND before running out of Hydrogen.Then, up to 12,000 B/D once they build a new H2 Plant… That’s a 150% increase in needed Hydrogen….no small plant.When you add 150% more H2 into a H/C, I’m only guessing the heat release alone will be tremendous.This is not simple, despite the existing metallurgy being okay…pumps, exchangers, instrumentation will need to be redesigned.Who is doing the engineering?Well, volume is up today and price is down….maybe some bashers are loading up….let’s hope so…it lets us out!"
Today's divestiture further suggests a strategic core that Go et al are hard at work tailoring.
"CLMT uses some cost advantaged Canadian crude which is currently trading with over a $50/bbl discount to WTI.FYI:Bloomberg---Western Canadian Select @$16-------- Brent @ $81--The drop has come as rising production from Canada’s oil-sands overwhelms the nation’s pipeline capacity, and as refinery capacity in the U.S. dwindles amid planned maintenance.WCS has now declined for 10 of the past 13 trading days, sending its discount to West Texas Intermediate crude to $52 a barrel, the widest on record in Bloomberg data stretching back to 2008.The situation worsened on Tuesday when a natural gas pipeline in British Columbia ruptured, forcing Washington oil refineries that are major buyers of Canadian crude to curtail operations.

Nice to see price over $7 again. Let's get the JV finalized!
"May WTI contract went negative today. Apparently, a lot of panic as the speculators were not prepared to take delivery. Hopefully, CLMT filled their storage tanks at under a $1/barrel, or negative. Who knows, but surely they were on the phone with their third party buyer saying we can take delivery of x amount. We'll see at next earnings presentation."
"Great Falls, Montana – March 7, 2019 – Calumet Montana Refining has confirmed an incident has occurred at their plant. At this time all plant personnel have been accounted for and there are no injuries to report. A perimeter has been established around the plant, and this includes some interruption to traffic. The cause of the incident is under investigation. Calumet’s top priority is the safety of plant staff and the community. Updates will be provided as they are available."
"Here is a quick update of some key refining market indicators from the CVR Energy Q2 report released after the bell (7/24/19). From Q1-2019, the NYMEX 2-1-1 crack spread improved $3.34/barrel to $22.41; the WTI-Midland differential increased $1.18 to $2.27/barrel, and WCS differential increased $2.12/barrel to $12.63. As far as the small refinery waiver, the whole exemption process is under a review, so likely won't hear any decision on this or another couple of months. That said, CLMT has a pretty good chance of getting their exemptions approved eventually for their smaller refineries. GL"
"Decent chance distribution declared during August earnings report. Payable in November. If so, this is $10 stock."
Asphalt season....Hope for a good quarter....
Looks like they must have said something negative at the conference today... or at least it was interpreted that way.
Someone post a plausible reason for the secrecy that has positive implication for the project’s prospectsOne plausible reason….I’ll wait
"Anybody tuned in…So they are relying on a new farming industry in Montana to generate feedstock?Farming, crop handling, processing, crushing, oil production?In Montana? What?Who is doing that? Where are those plans?They just decided NOW to take an FCCU T/A in the next three months…in the winter?Never heard of a more defensive negative earning callMuch worse than I thoughtI’m gone"
"So a big part of the viability of the project is canola oil….that is not currently being grown, processed and oil produced and needs capital to do so…Here is a link on how canola is transformed into oilhttps://www.canolacouncil.org/about-canola/processing/Are they going to be able to transform and grow the canola farming business to support their RND project?Ahhhh….noEven if they could, it won’t be up and running for years.This whole project requires preinvestment to be viableFor this….they sacrifice a 35 B/D cash cow? Not happening guys"
Latest analysis from Zacks investment has clmt estimated at a +.34 EPS this quarter
"What are your Pros and Cons to the S-8 filing besides dilution? I have seen how many long overtime hours the engineers have put into maintenance and turn around. They deserve to be rewarded as much as us, and it only makes sense to do so before the distribution is announced. If you told me that 2,000,000 shares is too many for who deserves the compensation then I could go along with that, but like I said I don’t mind rewarding and giving further incentive to those who are grinding for us to get a distribution reinstated."

What is JV?
"Reposting this from Seeking Alpha board. Thing are going to get real interesting around here!￼”zerobidComments1717 | + Followrumors of dozens, perhaps as many as 50 interested parties in Branded Lubes, which includes Truefuel. Price speculation is ~650-700M. 2025 bonds trading above par@101. Franklin owns > 60% of all CLMT debt, and still buying more,,,,, They know more than anyone on whats going on Calumet. Liquidation is on the table with bankers marketing 2 buckets of assets, cannot rule out someone with capital bidding for entire company(unlikely but possible) at this point, as everything is for sale as THG regroups and pivots, IMO. Stock is still well below SOP valuation, but have muted expectations to 10-14. Could adjust expectations higher if refining cracks continue to improve into 21, particularly GF as WCS spread continues to widen.Fred's daughters and GP Board member Amy Schumacher now CEO of The Heritage Group.

"Canyon Traveler is correct, I haven’t posted anywhere elseWhat I have posted are news related and have asked specific questionsI don’t know this Traveler guy, and he doesn’t know my positions, even though I have repeated revealed my positionsSo again for the record…I sold my CLMT shares once I realized I was being duped by management.I held my puts which were originally bought to protect my investment, and those have done nicely with each silly event CLMT holdsI have friends who hold CLMT and yes, I hope to help them get out of the bear trap….there are no buyers"
Technically this is bullish but I wonder how valuable technical analysis is on stocks with such low volume. Any opinions?
"With one half of estimated JV EBITDA now at $175 M, I would not be surprised if CLMT is holding out for 3x EBITDA which would be $525M from JV partner."
Seems to be holding it's own in this rather sleepy summer market.
I believe one of the creditors deadlines (Macquarie) Dec 15 has not been extended as of yet.....so if nothing else hits the fan earnings should be released this week.
"Why doesn’t someone post something on topic?Not a single analyst rates CLMT a buyThey are either neutral or sellNo buyer for the refineryNo JV PartnerSecrecy for 8 monthsNo feedstockNo Engineering ContractorNo source of fundingBonds coming due 100 days, very little cash on handIDA devastates LouisianaCome On…All true"
"I listened to the BOA presentation yesterday and Calumets management confirmed there are multiple bidders for Great Falls. Some domestic and some international companies. Although, the timing for the sale will come later in the year due to Covid-19, this bodes well for getting a decent price for this facility."
Nice run today. Any thoughts of future catalysts for the stock? Highly leveraged but moving towards more specialty chemicals (higher margins). Seems new management is good.
Ribbon cutting with MT governor at GF refinery as first renewable feed stock is delivered. They certainly act like JV is going forward...
2019 Pattern to Repeat? Last year CLMT more than doubled from this point through August of 2019. There are a lot of reasons why this could happen again. I increased my position this morning to take advantage of what should be a decent year. More than likely Great Falls is sold and we convert to a “C” Corp. Company has made it known that they are going to put more emphasis on their top line now that our house is mostly in order. Happy New Year Everyone!
Earnings coming the 8th get ready
With all that cash...think they’ll share the wealth? Or use it to pay down some debt?

"Someone has made a lot of money on this stock, unfortunately not unit holders. In hindsight I wish I would of been in a position to short it. It's been a shorts dream. Looking at the chart who knows how much lower it can go."
I’m going slow on the JV….how is it supposed to work? The JV partner gives Calumet money so they can delver their balance sheet? Who pays for the project? When does the project start?
"only daydreaming but any opinions on distribution amount at such time clmt is able and profitable enough to reinstate a distribution? I looked back to 2006. smallest quarterly was 30 cents. pps was about 10 at that time, so yield was about 11%. Similar yields at 8 pps would mean about 20 cents a quarter"
"Q3 was a bit disappointing based on expectations, but not bad too bad considering. First, they had $10MM in special charges (i.e. $6MM in ERP implementation expense, $2MM in M&A transaction expense (asset sales), and $2MM in realized hedging losses). Had this not been incurred, adjusted EBITDA would have been the $106MM or the best Q in since Q1 of 2015. Then they also had another $10MM reduction to earnings from unrealized hedging losses. This roughly offsets the favorable LCM adjustments, so I'll just call it a wash from the big commodity price moves due to Harvey at quarter's end. I was trying to figure out why the $6 improvement in their benchmark 2-1-1 only resulted in a couple of dollars improvement in their fuel product margin. Some is explained from the hedging losses, and it appears to me there was an adjustment in the CL-RINs obligation market adjustment for the liability carried forward from Q2 (up $15MM, but I couldn't determine this with any certainty. So although they had some hedging losses now, they took advantage of the big prices moves to lock in the big margins over the winter months. At these levels, it is doubtful we would see further hedging losses, but more likely hedging gains in Q4 and Q1 -18. Additionally, they stated significant specialty product revenue had been deferred into Q4. So all-in-all, I would expect Q4 to be better than what otherwise and in all likelihood, another decent quarter, say something like Q1. Anyway, huge volume today, over 3 million, with a strong rebound from the lows, was encouraging, and indicates to me that institutions are supporting this stock. I am looking forward to continued improvement in 2018 with huge debt reductions, continued earnings improvement, and eventually, the reinstatement of the dividend. GL longs."
My money says the JV is with $ET
"Did anyone hear in the conference call, they just the bids back for engineering and construction of the new required H2 plant.Remember, the RND is stuck at 5 MB/D until the new H2 plant comes into production.They knew this all along.Studied for 18 monthsAnnounced in Feb 2021, 6 months agoNow middle August with no movement on JV, H2 Plant Project, or Pretreatment plantFolks, that was 2 years agoThe emperor has no canola oil!"
One GF is converted to biodiesel and earning $220 to $260M EBITDA it should be a $1.5B asset!
Has anyone else noticed the open interest in the January '19 $10 calls? I don't recall ever seeing so much open interest in the past. Even the Jan. '19 $15 calls are showing good interest.

"CLMT will continue to go down till a distribution is announced that is just the way it is. The distribution is the reason for the investment in companies like this plain and simple. The down word slide in price is just as simple, tired of waiting and there are better places to park the cash."
"Just a heads up - GoSlow's comments correspond to the build up in the short position over the past two months, from 67K to 230K. Not a meaningful short position by any stretch of the imagination. It is clear, however, his objective here is to spread FUD. Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt"
"Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P is up 8.01% to 7.42"
So I keep stumbling over the idea that turning a 50’MB/D Hydrocracker into a 5 MB/D RND while cutting crude rate from 37 MB/D to 17 MB/D in Montana is a good ideaPeople say the Montana Refinery is a cash cow…this was the refinery they couldn’t sell..:Well at 17 MB/D ….the numbers are worse….Right?
"Let me be CLEAR about my following statement..I am not defending what's going on at CLMT.I am witness personally to a swap over to a ""new"" system in a large corparation that involved 42 units in as many cities. They paid 23 million for said ''huge improvement"" . After months of training for personel needed for data entry, it went live. Scheduling went upside down, paychecks for 1,400.00 were issued ay 140,000.00 ...this went on & on for 3 yrs. All the fixes cost another 2.8 million, in the end the entire system was scraped and the old one put back. Things run smoothly now. This was 12 yrs ago. fast forward to this year. A close friend, in charge of 105 offices [ chain of DR's] was sent for 3 weeks for training of their new super ""improved system"". He was to train heads of districts with new system upon completion. It was going to automate data entry, inventory, billing etc. payroll, etc. []ya know the drll] and spit out reports and tax liabilities. Same result 9 months later [now] total chaos, he carries 3 phones, is on call 24/7 with all heads, IT is going #$%$, and so many things going wrong, on so many levels....wishes he could go back & turn down the 6 figure 'Raise"" for taking the position.Forest Gump summed it up ""$hit"" happens""...hopefully this is CLMT's situation & nothing nefarious is going on. Guess we'll soon find out!"
Wouldn't surprised if we see another SEC Form 4 filed today or tomorrow from T. Go and/or W. Griffin. This seems to be the price where they've been buying.
"The crack spread margin in Q2 averaged $21.07 per barrel, its highest since 2015"
I really like the consolidation at this level - we are setting up very well for higher highs 
"Just listened to the call. Management is optimistic going forward. Crack margins have improved, Speciality is doing great. Great Falls joint venture formation will happen this year and will result in a cash infusion to company. GF transition to half biodiesel will start before end of year and be fully operation within 12 months. GF will generate huge RIN credits."
"If we had vision three years ago that the company was going to do this well executing it’s turn around plan, more than likely we would have been trading in the mid teens. The prospects of not paying a distribution in the near future is definitely a big reason why we are not gaining traction yet. For those who know the history of this company, our future looks pretty bright. Our debt ratio is headed under 4. Exposure to the volatile swings of the fuels market is way down. The money poured into our ERP system which caused a lot of money and headaches initially is now paying big dividends in self help initiatives. The company has successfully transitioned from a risk ladened, low margin business to a much more predictable higher margin business model. So yes Tim Go leaving introduces some uncertainty short term but that too will pass. This is a really good company headed in the right direction— throwing off a nice amount of cash. At some point the valuation will reflect the progress we’ve made as well as a promising future."
looks like finally bottemed out . 3yrs since last distribution. some positives- BUFFET says yes to oil (OXY). US INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE coming (asphalt). OIL staying up there $60. interest rate still low . might finally be a buy
a $.97 loss and they were supposed to break even?

Can we hold $3 today?
"So if the JV is going to infuse the company with $300M - why not gobble up half the float and be a 50% owner in the whole enterprise, not just Montana? Maybe that explains what we are seeing today?!"
"Buy,buy, by me"
I’m surprised this didn’t go to $10. Leverage ratio decreased from 13x this time last year to 5x. Tim go said he’d reinstate the distribution at 4x. And with the minimum dividend of .45 the distribution yield should bump the price up when it comes time.

"So. Goldman files a 13A. Looked back through the last two years filings and haven't seen any 13A's except for Heritage. Methinks Goldman has up'd their stake.

"New SEC filingItem 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (the “Partnership”) is party to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2014 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), among the Partnership, certain Subsidiaries of the Partnership, certain lenders (the “Lenders”), and Bank of America, N.A., as agent for the Lenders (“Agent”). As previously disclosed in a Form 8-K dated November 15, 2017, the Lenders had consented to permit the Partnership to deliver its unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 (the “3Q Financial Statements”) on or before December 5, 2017. However, the Partnership currently anticipates that it will be unable to deliver the 3Q Financial Statements when required due to financial reporting difficulties caused by the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. Failure to deliver the 3Q Financial Statements by such time would have been an “Event of Default” as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement. If an Event of Default exists under the Credit Agreement, then the Lenders may accelerate the Partnership’s borrowings under the Credit Agreement, require cash collateralization of outstanding letters of credit, and exercise other rights and remedies thereunder. As of November 29, 2017, there were no borrowings under the revolving portion of the Credit Agreement and $82.9 million in outstanding letters of credit.Effective November 30, 2017, the Lenders consented in writing to postpone the due date for delivery of the 3Q Financial Statements until December 31, 2017. The failure to deliver the 3Q Financial Statements by such date will constitute an Event of Default."
"no news, maybe good news?"
"To buy or not to buy ?? That is the question. Long term this stock will go up. Strategy is right, products are solid and market fundamentals for oil right now are all pointing in the right direction. My only concern is the Go teams apparent indifference to its partnership and substandard PA department. Many of their current challenges could be mitigated by a strong PA strategy to manage the message better. Wondering if 8 is truly our new base.... or maybe 7. I don't see them going much lower. Revenues are too strong."

""CLMT reports Q2 EPS of $0.21 vs $0.10, beating the S&P Capital IQ Consensus Estimate by $0.24, driven by operational improvements at the Shreveport and San Antonio refineries, allowing for increased production capacity and increased margin capture, as well a continued reduction in Calumet's transportation costs."

"It’s that time again, so thought I would share what I am seeing for the upcoming Q1 release. First, for the Specialty division, my adjustments from Q1-18 and Q4-18 reflect an adjusted EBITDA range of $64MM and $57MM, respectively. As Q4 is typically the weakest seasonal Q for Specialty, I am inclined to lean towards the Q1 number as being the more reliable of the two. Nevertheless, I settled for the average of the two @ $60MM.For Fuels, the Q4-18 comparison had excessive adjustments as the WCS and WTI Midland discounts narrowed considerably during Q4. As a result, reliability from the Q4 comparison is believed to be somewhat diminished. That said, the adjustments, net of the hedging activity, indicates Adj. EBITDA of roughly $20MM from this division. Continuing, a comparison against Q1-18, which had much smaller adjustments, resulted in an Adj. EBITDA a touch over $40MM. Hopefully, this will prove to be a more reliable number. For the quarter, the gulf coast WTI 2-1-1 was $17.00 or about $1 higher than Q1-2018, and the WTI-Midland discount was similar. However, a substantial adjustment was still required for a lesser WCS discount, and a positive volume adjustment for less turnaround activity. As a check, a simple net refining margin of $5/bl at 75,000 bpd is roughly $34MM. Without the turnaround activity, and hedges in place for Q1, this appears achievable. That said, I have selected $30MM for fuels, which is the average of the two quarterly comparisons.All things considered; I have estimated a lofty $90MM in adjusted EBITDA before non-cash/unusual adjustments. This would be an excellent start to the year heading into the cyclically stronger Q2 & Q3 quarters. For Q2, it should be noted that the WTI-Midland discount has widened back out to the $3-5 range and the WCS discount is back over $12/bbl. Also, as of the 5/6/19 close, the GC WTI 2-1-1 was a strong $22.75 based on the EIA info. This is well above the Q1 avg, so even though we are just short of the half way point, Q2 is looking pretty good so far. GL longs."

Interesting that’s these most recent phantom units are tied to a change of control. Could get interesting!
"Lots of day trading IMO. Obviously shorts saw the opportunity here toward the end of the day, or somebody with a sizeable position started the rout."
Appears to be a strong Q1 - continuing to trend in the right direction. The market's response and call should be interesting.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calumet-specialty-products-partners-l-110000265.html
Two steps forward one step back. At this rate we could see $3 by June 1st.
At least they had enough sense to make the 2nd delay announcement on a late afternoon Friday to help minimize the volatility.
Renewable diesel production capacity is expected to nearly quintuple to about 2.65 billion gallons (63 million barrels) by 2024The Calumet RND project will be soybean oil only….in 2022 thru 2024.Anyone willing to do the soybean oil balance will see…The Soybean crop is being decimated by the northern plains heat wave.This seasonal drop off can not be recovered by 2022 winter productionThis ship has sailed…
Another week of silence on the JV statusHonestly I don’t know anything about the JV status….but I am willing to admit the secrecy is telling
Although interest rates are rising and the 10 year note is growing. Higher interest rates signal a stronger economy and lead me to believe that would lead to an increase in energy consumed.
"It looks like one Rocky Mountain Refiner must have had good earnings. CVRR posted a $.90 divident. I think the margins at the Great Falls refinery were even better. They don't have as many barrels going through, but it should add nicely to this quarters earnings. I know that margins reached record highs in early July. They tapered off slowly for the rest of the summer, but still remained above average. I don't know how the rest of the company did, but I think the refining portion did all right. I'm also looking forward to not having the debt interest in the future. I honestly believe that if you buy at these prices, you will make your purchase price in dividends within a matter of a couple years. There is no reason they couldn't return to the .$.4 to .50/quarter dividend. It may take a while, but it should come around."
Wow 130K shares traded that last 10 minutes.
read the latest release ........and RELAX !
"Hello - SEC filing shows ""After giving effect to the Redemption and the financing thereof, the Partnership estimates its interest expense will be approximately $138.3 million per year, assuming no further changes to its capital structure and based on the current interest rate of 3.69% that is applicable to LIBOR loans under its credit facility. In comparison, the Partnership’s reported interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $155.5 million"", can this mean the blend of rates and principal outstanding is actually an $18M savings with the new notes? Perhaps we get a bump if this is correct and gets digested as such by the market."
"Everyone on this board is cheering this stock, which has destroyed investor capital for 7-8 years in a row. If history is a guide, they will take advantage of the recent rise and do another equity issuance."
PR Newswire says on our about Dec 28th for Q3...
Bought on the dip will show profit on next report relax and glta
11% haha that’s laughable. What were they thinking??? Let’s redeem the 6.5% early and issue out 11% notes. Who thought that was a good idea? Better have some really favorable terms!!

"A couple of thoughts heading into the Q4 earnings release. I agree with an earlier assessment that based on the huge decline in crude prices in the quarter, it is likely that GAAP earnings will be negative. This will be caused by a large non-cash lower of cost or market (LCM) inventory mark, which also is netted out of the adjusted EBITDA and the distributable cash flow (DCF) numbers. While more useful than the GAAP number, I believe this is still misleading as to the actual performance. I am more interested in the cash being generated from earnings (i.e. reported DCF + non-cash LCM adjustment), that is available for debt reduction, and eventual distributions (similar to the FFO calc for REITs). Based on their earlier press release, liquidity improved $91MM. If even one-third of this was generated from earnings verse balance sheet changes, I would consider this a win for what is typically their weakest quarter in the cycle, and in light of Q4’s past.Also, in the past when crude prices tumbled, the company has seized the opportunity to increase their forward crude purchases to improve future refining margins. The Q1 2016 10-Q reflected significant purchases in the quarter for the remainder of 2016 & 2017. Further, as of 9/30/18, the company had sizable portions of their WCS and WTI-Midland needs locked in for 2019 and the first ½ of 2019, respectively, at excellent margins. I will be interested to see if they rolled/added to their hedging positions and/or started some forward crude purchasing. While the extreme discount for WCS has narrowed to about $12/barrel currently, the Great Falls diesel crack spread is still extraordinary and diesel cracks’ in general should offset a lot of the early Q1 weakness observed in the gulf coast gasoline crack as we move into spring. More importantly though, Specialty margins should be doing just fine so far in Q1.Overall, with the lower crude pricing reset, the majority of the heavy turnaround schedule in the rearview, and continued self-help improvements, 2019 should be a much stronger year, but it wouldn’t hurt to start out the year coming off a better than average Q4. GL longs."
Price action indicates that CLMT could declare a distribution this quarter instead of next quarter. At a minimum they must have called the 11.5% notes which substantially reduces debt and paves the way for a distribution.
A lot of Insider stock filings today

Looks like we didn't get an announcement on a September dividend. Maybe that will happen in December or March of next year.If cash flow continues to improve.. We can now look forward to a. possible cancelation of the need to buy RINs. This will improve the bottom line.
Who’s this mysterious “equity partner” for the renewable diesel? I have 3 yahoo message board dollars that says it’s the Heritage Group.
Very orderly buying; nothing sloppy in today’s price action… very interesting 
"great way to end the week. 400,000 units in the last 15 minutes. this up move has some serious backing. GLTA"
There is more action on this board than there is trading on this stock.The hypsters have all but disappeared.Their red faces can’t be shownHow embarrassing for the emperor…no hiding the truth…no JV Partner
This stock is hard (impossible) to figure. Possible sale of lubricants for 700mil and of Glen Falls refining for 500mil. The sale of either facility would reduce debt by 50-40% and reduce expenses by 70-50 mil. This has got to be a winner. And yet the P/P share has gone from 3.90 to 3.10 a 20% decline in 2 months.
Why the big increase today ??
