"Wix New App building platform without even one single code is brilliant, for $200 a month it has huge market potential of over 300M Wix user and developers ($6B Monthly) "
"Wix is still one of the fastest growing companies in Israel, will recover soon."
wix is doing well in this stock meltdown!... if it falls below 99... i'll accumulate!
Solid earnings and strong outlook but down massively. Clearly general market sentiment. Long term this is a winner tho!
"Back to $400 in no time, my Israeli insider tip me off about the No code Apps demand"
Why is this gem falling today ? :(
My wix site does about 500k a year to this point I guess I’m helping haha
this is the exact stock that is selling off. high price stocks w no earnings. not to mention nothing special about this company but it's huge market cap on smoke and mirrors
Upgrades too pump into earnings coming soon? 
Back to 150
"I like the acquisition, perfect fit for continued growth"
"Alexa tank climbed 29 to 171 in last 3 monthsVery bullishTargets being increased across the board before earnings to mid 300’s , watch for blow out earnings and stock at 400"
"Well I just tried to post a really positive note twice but Yahoo took it down. I guess I’m finished with trying to help here,yahoo is wasting my time in the morning￼. Should have a pretty positive year once the tax loss harvesting is finished lots of price targets maintained today￼. GL everyone"
Over reaction for this Minor Covid guidance “Wix lowered its full-year revenue outlook to $1.27 billion from $1.29 billion”
anyone think WIX trading with PEG ratio of 4.7 and 14x sales is expensive? growth is 23% yoy which is actually lower than behemoth intel@25% and trading with a PE in the teens.
How did you all hear about this stock. Guess I'm late to the party..
"great company, keep holding on!"
Wow! This reversal was not expected!
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/wix/
Wix.com is down 8.93% to 264.00
40 - 50 top
This will go back up slowly just like it did last time. This is one of many stocks like TXG that drop and go back up multiple times. Get it while you can.
"told you all, start moving up :) , it will be 100 in a year, they just need to keep working hard and be innovative ."
"way over priced. deceleration of growth,. 25% growth outlook, and trading over 10x EV."
"guys - please be accurate. earnings are not great.revenue is great, subscriptions are great.there are no earnings, losses. and little cash flow"
"Look at Shopify, they are the sameWix may exceeds $300 in Q2. Their monthly website traffic increase 50% in April comparing to Mar.People who use Wix are all doing business and they will support the platform which helps them making money without reason"
I guess people see good earnings coming...
"Just profit taking, added to position after earnings report."
July $320 call for $2.80
Ho hi can it go? Comments please...

What a crazy market day today. I have no idea what tomorrow's market reaction will be to earnings
Bought at $67 in 2017. Saw the value and quality of Wix from day one. I build websites for small businesses and have been using Wix for ten years. It’s a fantastic product for non programmers like me. I train my clients once I’m finished with the design and build. This is the future of website design.
Volume showing that it's getting ready to move up!!! $275 before month end!
"Wix dropshipping is the future of E-commerce, they integrate with all the Israeli network, Payoneer, Fiver, Etsy, GLBE…Etc"
TESLA stock will beat earnings report. This will be an easy 8 % to make in the next 3 months.
"Its going up it is a double bottom pattern, Money time is coming"
WiX crushed it!!!!!!!!!
"I started buying shares around $295 a few weeks back ... then more as it dropped into the 280s, 270s, 260s, and even at 258. It was scary for sure. Low point I was down almost 54K. As of Friday market close ... I’m now up 32K. That’s an 86K swing in less than 3 weeks. Would you all hold thru earnings or sell and take the 32K profit??? Curious to hear how you all deal w/ such volatility in your short term trades heading into earnings."
"Bought into wix at 255.24 a share. Do you guys think i got in at a good price? Guessing it was down today because of trump, like the whole texh sector."
"Beats revenues and over reaction. If you have not bought today, probably will not get any cheaper gl"
Little old wix posting green when the rest of the market stank it out
I think the reaction to the earnings this morning was a massive over reaction and the return to these prices reflects that wix is still considerably less bubblish than other ecommerce and tech stocks and has significant potential to grow with great upside.
Bought 1/4 of a share. Wish me luck!
All time high for Shop - Wix lagging. Some talk Apple could buy SHOP - that would rally WIX too I would think
"sorry, $230"
"Just kick back and hold this stock....3 years from now we will be saying hey didn’t we buy more. Huge market, going higher"
looks like nobody is buying this stock!!
For 11b company I am surprised there is barley any conversations here... a bit strange...In any case I am very optimistic and see them go to $400 by end of the year.
fvrr is the next big jumper from tel Aviv. 30 to 1 price to cap ratio. wix is only 19.5 to 1
how many shares will they issue to raise capital
"How do you have over $300M in revenue and not earn a penny of profit ? Grossly overpaid top management, perhaps ?Building web sites for small business ? What year is it ? 1999 ??Why don't you go troll the ETSY ecosystem. That way you can lose more money, and make it up in volume. LOL"

Just read that earnings will not be till 6 Aug. FYI. Not sure how the news media outlets got their dates so wrong (esp. CNBC)
i hope this time's for real on the wix pop...been rooting for you
Wix is the key to our economy
$WIX is much cheaper.....compare sales/price ratio......
This is big bubble. Did u check FVRR? This is going down like that or even worst.
all equities getting destroyed. buy up as many July and beyond calls on as many stocks as you can. July 1st the pandemic is over. Equity market will go boom really really hard!
"beats revenues and earnings, and raises view, but this stock is dropping by 5%..WTH?"
Don't think WIX has even caught mainstream attention yet....
Great buying opportunity
"I have no problem with the increased expenses related to customer care and services. Given the global situation the past year its pretty understandable. And from a long term perspective it's going to pay off. ""Treat your customers and clients well, help them succeed, and they will return the favor in long term loyalty"""
Just keep on adding shares!
Am I the only WIX investor?
"Wow! This is quite a day!! I am guessing earning were, pretty, pretty, good!"
EPS beat by 15.82%
something big should come soon...
Been in this for about 6 months now and been very happy......also a SHOP shareholder for over 2 years. Curious as to others thoughts on WIX long-term prospects......what advantages do you see these guys having over folks like Go Daddy and Shop? Thanks in advance
Alright alright alright...
All the gains from yesterday gone.
The next Shopify with a way way lower valuation and decent growth! BUY
"Revenue blow out , taking market share and strong future, upgrades coming."
can some longs explain their reasoning on holding WIX? recent drop caught my eye and looks like a good entry point for buyers TIA
"WIX is the future of E-commerce, Shop is close platform, you don’t own a business you own account and that’s the difference"
WIX to $320 in a month or so.

Loading up here at the 52 week low.Thanks to whoever is selling at this point. I could see this dropping another 10 points and then going back to 300 like on the last earnings.
"I’ve been selling into this rally. Now that we are at or near all time highs, time to move to a more defensive position for me."

Wix Teams Up With Wolthttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-wolt-joins-wix-to-arm-small-sites-with-the-one-thing-they-re-missing-1.10104349
Wix.com is up 8.11% to 302.43
Excited too see how this does on the 4th.
Earnings mixed; crushed revenue but lost way way more than expected (.07) in earnings. Street doesn’t seem to care about the latter.
6000 + Forward P/E ??? 
All analysts point to a rise and the stock is down and not going up...???
When it hits $100?
"Why is it down they had outstanding q2 results:Q2 2020 Financial Results  Total revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $236.1 million, compared to $185.4 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 27% y/y  On a y/y constant currency basis, Q2 revenue would have been $237.9 million, up 28% y/y  Creative Subscriptions revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $190.2 million, compared to $157.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 21% y/y  Business Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $45.9 million, compared to $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 62% y/y"
"65 Weeks low, Thanks "
This is definitely a buy at this point !!  thanks
Go up 
Wix blows their earnings out of the water yet it's dropping $8 pre-market? Makes perfect sense 
"Squarespace, godaddy, Shopify, weeble.... Shopify is the best"
Great Buying opportunity...$125 soon...Buy Buy Buy
Congrats to whoever bought wix at the low today. You just scored a super easy win.
"first time looking at this company. is anybody concerned about their debt level? other issues? the numbers scare me a little. i still need to do some digging, but thought i would throw it out there. thanks for any comments."
WIX should make there own operating system for phones and create a new app store community. The time could not be better to start a new movement.
What a Rebound
"Oversold short term, won't be surprised if it bounced back up in a couple of months."
wix to the moon!
Beautiful Cup forming here ️ 
"108 seems the floor, but late afternoon rally could turn this to Green."
Wix is a 50 billion dollar cap company. Puts it over $1k a share. Look to break $500 and $26 billion by April.
Lets go longs
Will WIX get back to $200?
Hope people bought the dip.
"anyone shorting? PEG >15, PE = 178, growth rate 23%, and losing money"

"own both shop and Wix which have same business models and compete for same market. revenues wise shop is 1 year ahead but profit or rather loss wise, Wix is 2 years behind given loss ratios. given what financially happen to shop in the past for the stock price, I am not saying Wix will do exactly the same but it sure will do great."
WIX is up 5.23% to 61.35
Where are the Bulls ? :D
this will rock very soon!
Bought wix at 20 and will stay wix for long. another shopify in the making.
Why down when earning so great?
WIX is up 5.19% to 68.95
"4 Strong buy $350, going all in tomorrow"
Motgan Stanly just update price target $339.00. Hold it
Wix upgraded to 130. Shorts run for exits tomorrow. Something brewing big..
Wix.com is up 7.02% to 218.75
"So we saw what happened last earnings report… yet frantic buyers bid up the price to the sky again only to crash at the earnings, again! Got it, that was smart. Hey you should do it again"
great company great report!!! I'm long in!
"Hmmm yeah, bit of an over sell I'd say. It'll be back up in the mid 300s again in no time."
1 day RSI below 20.1 hour RSI below 10.15 minute RSI below 5.How low can she go?
"Great Report, hope to see the uptrend continues."
overreacting a little aren't we
Is this a good entry point?
Citicorp raised to buy and 330.00 target
"3Q loss/shr $0.34 adjusted beat estimates, shy on revenue. Guidance soft."
Earnings looks great
I bought some puts today...... the march 19s with a 240 strike...cost me! $12.20 each ..... the april 16s with a 230 strike cost me 95 cents each .......just looking at a slightly overextended market..... I also bought the juse18s strike $30 for BLNK... and they cost me $5.30 each........not looking for millions on this ... just enough to buy a burger and a soda.......
Last comment was 2 months ago. No love for Wix even when it’s about to break out.
Hopefully upgrades in the morning. There was nothing bad in earnings report. It should recover all tomorrow.
will close $330 today
"Asked an acquaintance of how she knew of wix and it seems that a lot of school are recommending it to their students for making their own websites, this kind of technology is getting used alot more these days, even students who don't have any interest in making websites with hardcoding can pick up no-code or low-code platforms like wix for making their websites, I see huge growing potential, even more then SHOP to be honest, WIX is more versatile. What do you guys think?"
Bought in August 2018 up 182.65%. May lose 20%+ today but long term should recover and keep climbing.
It's going down more to retest $142 and then $130.
It's 100 dollar stock. Old investors are still good
$300 is gonna be here sooner than later
This drop over the last few days is not a problem with wix. Nothing has changed with the company fundamentally. It is a problem with a larger market shift. All ecommerce and Faang and pandemic tech stocks are all down. Recovery stocks such as restaurants are up but not by much. There's a lot of fear selling going on right now. Four weeks ago on this exact date the same thing happened where the market went extremely red. Panic selling ensued but then after a few weeks the market recovered. Wix also went along for that ride and ended up setting all time highs as larger macro economic forces can greatly influence price action. I'm personally just holding on through the storm and holding hope that the market forces will shift in the next two weeks as it did one month ago.
Dropping like a brick in the next year also… this is a looooong drop my friends! Not surprised if this will turn into next short joke.
Still a believer in this company but sold my shares when it hit $300. Made enough to fund my Roth for two years and at this point in my life - 57 - it was the decision I can live with.GLTA
Go Wix!
"Hope, I am not too early to buy this..just pulled the trigger..."
"Just remember, it’s an investment. It takes a long time to go up, it comes down fast and violently. Be patient."

"they lost $1.03 in eps. non gap they lost $0.14. how is that better than expected.trading at 30x free cash flow, 9x forward sales, no earnings."
Curious as to why WIX was down 3.5% on Friday. Anyone know? Can't find any news other than the $385 mil convertible offering. Could that be it?Some dilution issue?
oversold at this point
is there a fee to hold this stock considering it is headquartered in Israel ?
Oh hey there Wix... Nice to have you back up doing something again!
Cathie Wood and ARK Invest really blew it by not investing more in WIX!
anybody knows why there is no pre-market update?
Anybody here anymore ?
Anyone know why it goes down?
Volume is going down again. Seems like whichever institution was selling is now done selling.
This was one of the nicest comebacks in history
6/5/18 Watchlist ~~~~~ $ARWR $MSPC $WIX $MOMO $AAOI ALL ABOARD YACHT IS LEAVING THE DOCK!
Wix.com reached an all time high at 319.34
"So... The physical world is put on hold... Everything work related is going online. Restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques etc that might not have had a digital presence before are likely scrambling to quickly set up a website to do online orders, shopping and take out No reason why Wix should be dropping and they will likely benefit long term. Buy!!"
BOUGHT 20 SHARE TOO HUGE DROP.. ENTER 288 .. GOOD LUCK PAL
"LONG on WIX. In at $67 four years ago and still a believer in the business model, direction leadership is taking and future growth possibilities."
The market must not like 38% revenue growth (vs 41% last quarter). Law of big numbers I guess.
$70-80 is the value of this.
New shareholder here!
