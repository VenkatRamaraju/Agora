It's going down more to retest $142 and then $130.
Has WIX given any thought to acquiring NEXCF?

"Hope, I am not too early to buy this..just pulled the trigger..."
Loading up here at the 52 week low.Thanks to whoever is selling at this point. I could see this dropping another 10 points and then going back to 300 like on the last earnings.
Been in this for about 6 months now and been very happy......also a SHOP shareholder for over 2 years. Curious as to others thoughts on WIX long-term prospects......what advantages do you see these guys having over folks like Go Daddy and Shop? Thanks in advance
For perspective I’m reading posts from ONE year ago where comments were reflecting on the ‘over-valued’ $108 price... I’m long since 2017 but never would have predicted a 300+% return in three years.
"Wow! This is quite a day!! I am guessing earning were, pretty, pretty, good!"
"I started a position here last week bc I feel the valuation relative to SHOP makes no sense and is way too low. Anyone have thoughts on why WIX trading at such a low price to sales multiple compared to SHOP? If WIX crushes revenue targets as it could easily do, could be some serious price appreciation here IMO"
I guess people see good earnings coming...
"Asked an acquaintance of how she knew of wix and it seems that a lot of school are recommending it to their students for making their own websites, this kind of technology is getting used alot more these days, even students who don't have any interest in making websites with hardcoding can pick up no-code or low-code platforms like wix for making their websites, I see huge growing potential, even more then SHOP to be honest, WIX is more versatile. What do you guys think?"
Go Wix!
Take profit and enjoy your long weekend.It is coming under $280.00.
What is good number to buy some wix?
Time to jump in.
"Why is it down they had outstanding q2 results:Q2 2020 Financial Results  Total revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $236.1 million, compared to $185.4 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 27% y/y  On a y/y constant currency basis, Q2 revenue would have been $237.9 million, up 28% y/y  Creative Subscriptions revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $190.2 million, compared to $157.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 21% y/y  Business Solutions revenue in the second quarter of 2020 was $45.9 million, compared to $28.4 million in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 62% y/y"
BOUGHT 20 SHARE TOO HUGE DROP.. ENTER 288 .. GOOD LUCK PAL
"Folks, are you watching the news? There's social unrest in Israel and Hamas is shooting rockets at Tel-Aviv. That's why Wix is down. Same as Fiverr. They have their HQs in Tel-Aviv. Once the situation calms down, so will this sell-off."
Great earnings. The only downside from my point of view was the decrease in the gross margins from 74% to ~68% now due to their investments. This needs to be maintained if not increased for WIX to be as big and successful as big dogs like Shopify etc
Little old wix posting green when the rest of the market stank it out
Wix.com reached an all time high at 243.73
"I have no problem with the increased expenses related to customer care and services. Given the global situation the past year its pretty understandable. And from a long term perspective it's going to pay off. ""Treat your customers and clients well, help them succeed, and they will return the favor in long term loyalty"""
go wix go!
It looks like tariffs news will be good. I am hoping markets will rebound very good. With that wix should move up good .
"So we saw what happened last earnings report… yet frantic buyers bid up the price to the sky again only to crash at the earnings, again! Got it, that was smart. Hey you should do it again"
Bought at $67 in 2017. Saw the value and quality of Wix from day one. I build websites for small businesses and have been using Wix for ten years. It’s a fantastic product for non programmers like me. I train my clients once I’m finished with the design and build. This is the future of website design.
Citicorp raised to buy and 330.00 target
TESLA stock will beat earnings report. This will be an easy 8 % to make in the next 3 months.
"Look at Shopify, they will reach $200 soon, i think"
can some longs explain their reasoning on holding WIX? recent drop caught my eye and looks like a good entry point for buyers TIA
Alright alright alright...
Still a believer in this company but sold my shares when it hit $300. Made enough to fund my Roth for two years and at this point in my life - 57 - it was the decision I can live with.GLTA
For 11b company I am surprised there is barley any conversations here... a bit strange...In any case I am very optimistic and see them go to $400 by end of the year.
"own both shop and Wix which have same business models and compete for same market. revenues wise shop is 1 year ahead but profit or rather loss wise, Wix is 2 years behind given loss ratios. given what financially happen to shop in the past for the stock price, I am not saying Wix will do exactly the same but it sure will do great."
I'm thinking of buying tomorrow. Stochastic should be indicating a new cycle uptrend. Bounced off the 50 SMA; nice pullback strategy to all those technical analysts.
wix is a great investment
It’s alive!
Hopefully upgrades in the morning. There was nothing bad in earnings report. It should recover all tomorrow.
"Oversold short term, won't be surprised if it bounced back up in a couple of months."
All time high for Shop - Wix lagging. Some talk Apple could buy SHOP - that would rally WIX too I would think
Curious as to why WIX was down 3.5% on Friday. Anyone know? Can't find any news other than the $385 mil convertible offering. Could that be it?Some dilution issue?
Wix.com reached an all time high at 158.06
"Revenue blow out , taking market share and strong future, upgrades coming."
Got a follow through day here 
"I’ve been selling into this rally. Now that we are at or near all time highs, time to move to a more defensive position for me."
Wix.com is up 6.72% to 260.58
The market must not like 38% revenue growth (vs 41% last quarter). Law of big numbers I guess.
"3Q loss/shr $0.34 adjusted beat estimates, shy on revenue. Guidance soft."
Deal me in. Let’s go!
Is anybody out there?
New shareholder here!
Am I the only WIX investor?
Sooo Wix to $400?

"I started buying shares around $295 a few weeks back ... then more as it dropped into the 280s, 270s, 260s, and even at 258. It was scary for sure. Low point I was down almost 54K. As of Friday market close ... I’m now up 32K. That’s an 86K swing in less than 3 weeks. Would you all hold thru earnings or sell and take the 32K profit??? Curious to hear how you all deal w/ such volatility in your short term trades heading into earnings."
"sorry, $230"
will buy if goes lower then $200
"Great Report, hope to see the uptrend continues."
"This is a complete coronavirus momentum play being pushed higher, it is an exceptional short right now. This is not spotify as someone mentioned in this board, will be back at $150 before it hits $220"

Volume is going down again. Seems like whichever institution was selling is now done selling.
Do not sleep on Israeli tech. Who knows how high this can go!
WIX crashed 20% at the open then went up to reach new all-time high in one day. But it will likely drift downward within the next 30 days.

Very low volume :/ why so small?
Is this the bottom?
"How do you have over $300M in revenue and not earn a penny of profit ? Grossly overpaid top management, perhaps ?Building web sites for small business ? What year is it ? 1999 ??Why don't you go troll the ETSY ecosystem. That way you can lose more money, and make it up in volume. LOL"

This stock cannot act any worse. Pretty much down every day
I don’t know if I should buy $FB or $WIX or $FIVE I’m stuck help lol
WIX should make there own operating system for phones and create a new app store community. The time could not be better to start a new movement.
is there a fee to hold this stock considering it is headquartered in Israel ?
looks like nobody is buying this stock!!

i hope this time's for real on the wix pop...been rooting for you
"beats revenues and earnings, and raises view, but this stock is dropping by 5%..WTH?"
I think the reaction to the earnings this morning was a massive over reaction and the return to these prices reflects that wix is still considerably less bubblish than other ecommerce and tech stocks and has significant potential to grow with great upside.
"So... The physical world is put on hold... Everything work related is going online. Restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques etc that might not have had a digital presence before are likely scrambling to quickly set up a website to do online orders, shopping and take out No reason why Wix should be dropping and they will likely benefit long term. Buy!!"
anybody knows why there is no pre-market update?
Just read that earnings will not be till 6 Aug. FYI. Not sure how the news media outlets got their dates so wrong (esp. CNBC)
This will go back up slowly just like it did last time. This is one of many stocks like TXG that drop and go back up multiple times. Get it while you can.
Citi upgrade to 125 from 116. Two upgrades. This will recover fast. Gl

Great day good to see all those buys under $100 and in the low $100's were the right move!!! WIX is still a screaming BUY!!! this story just keeps getting better!!!
Solid earnings and strong outlook but down massively. Clearly general market sentiment. Long term this is a winner tho!
Don't think WIX has even caught mainstream attention yet....

buy under $220
This was one of the nicest comebacks in history
this will rock very soon!
Wix is a 50 billion dollar cap company. Puts it over $1k a share. Look to break $500 and $26 billion by April.
And we have breakout!
Earnings mixed; crushed revenue but lost way way more than expected (.07) in earnings. Street doesn’t seem to care about the latter.
Unbelievable! a $40 swing...What a beast!
5.65B market cap for a website creator. This market has truly lost it right now.
for goodness sake...please break thar 300
WIX to $320 in a month or so.
"220 tomorrow, pgny, wtrh, all 3 come screaming back tomorrow!"
What a Rebound
Last comment was 2 months ago. No love for Wix even when it’s about to break out.
"With all the protesters second wave of corona is coming even faster.. will push back the reopening... then the flue season will start.. thus, we are not going to be reopened fully this year.. WIX will still be in position to grow rapidly... I can see end of June we are at 300..."
Happy Friday to all my WIX longs!
"Wix is still one of the fastest growing companies in Israel, will recover soon."
all equities getting destroyed. buy up as many July and beyond calls on as many stocks as you can. July 1st the pandemic is over. Equity market will go boom really really hard!
Volume showing that it's getting ready to move up!!! $275 before month end!
why up big after hours?
"Beats revenues and over reaction. If you have not bought today, probably will not get any cheaper gl"
doesn't seem to be able to stay above 300..think this is the 4th time it's tried since march
How did you all hear about this stock. Guess I'm late to the party..
Argh. Wish I had picked up more @245. Not sure we will see it at that level again for a while (maybe early nov election turmoil.)
Wix to 450 by April!
Motgan Stanly just update price target $339.00. Hold it
Bought in August 2018 up 182.65%. May lose 20%+ today but long term should recover and keep climbing.
Beautiful Cup forming here ️ 
"65 Weeks low, Thanks "
I'll take Wix for $400! the consumer data that Wix has as it acquires more small businesses is pure gold
WiX crushed it!!!!!!!!!
This drop over the last few days is not a problem with wix. Nothing has changed with the company fundamentally. It is a problem with a larger market shift. All ecommerce and Faang and pandemic tech stocks are all down. Recovery stocks such as restaurants are up but not by much. There's a lot of fear selling going on right now. Four weeks ago on this exact date the same thing happened where the market went extremely red. Panic selling ensued but then after a few weeks the market recovered. Wix also went along for that ride and ended up setting all time highs as larger macro economic forces can greatly influence price action. I'm personally just holding on through the storm and holding hope that the market forces will shift in the next two weeks as it did one month ago.
Wix.com reached an all time high at 319.34
