PII is down -9.55% to 121.42
Dca monthly don’t care about price long term play just loaded up
It has tanked following the past 3 earnings releases. I may just sell it the day before next quarter's earnings release and buy it back the next morning. It looks like a lot of people have been doing this.
a finance guy as interim ceo? doesn't fit - i don't think it will lead to permanent job as ceo - he is not a strategy guy ... kind of odd to me ... are they looking outside the company for a ceo with a deep bench in house? they must be ...
They just made the announcement that the fix to the fire problem on the side by sides did not actually solve the fire issues. A new warning just went out to the owners.I thought this issue was behind us.
"If I didn't use my side by all the times they say I shouldn't while waiting for recall repair, I'd never use it. Welcome aboard Larry Kingsley a couple years ago. Bring in the Danaher Business System. Smoke and mirrors. Work outsourced I'm sure, cuts to employee benefits oh yes, quality control cuts- don't need it. Just got my Polaris made in China doors. CanAm it will be. Ruining the company Kingsley!!!"
"Polaris products are mostly highly discretionary, which means sales will likely be hurt significantly in the next recession. The inverted yield curve means we'll most likely see a recession within the next 12-18 months. With the market forward looking, expect quite a bit more downside in PII. Love the company long term, short term could be painful. Invest accordingly! Would appreciate other's thoughts. I don't currently own shares, but plan to initiate a position at some point and will average in from there. Good luck PII longs."
I agree. This appears like they were all surprised by this and had no “what if Scott ever leaves” plan in place. My 2 cents. I’m probably wrong.
Polaris is up 10.47% to 108.23
Wow! Looks like a nice Beat!!!
"We’ve owned 2 and they are now back ordered for the Rocks and Trails model. Very durable and people are out being active, I would think this stock would be so well. Big demand for their product."
i do worry about PII talent following Scott Wine over there ...poaching talent is always a concern...
"Try looking deeper, they lost over $3 a share other than the impairment charge on goodwill. Financial engineering at its finest."
"electric bicycle sales very strong in covid 19 disaster,because stimulus plans boost people income strong growth,so pii can keeping strong growth,because pii products can help people short distance traveling and save money,"
CEO leaving to go to another company?More to this story than we're hearing Iwould imagine!
Snowmobiles must be flying off the shelves. Best year in a long time.
Blowout earnings. Congratulations to company in this difficult time.
dumped 50 percent of my Postion at 100 this this morning knew it was the right choice
It's the tariffs
PII Polaris and BRP DOOO are pretty good stock !
i wonder how much supply chain issues impacted pii. that is all i see in the headlines from other companies.
i bought some shares on Thursday. low share price and nice dividend. i always liked polaris. i am not overly fond of boat purchase but i will hope that they made smart move. we shall see .. glta
Were forward looking earnings/revenues revised down?? What in the world is going on with PII????
Pretty good return considering the March low’s. Funny how this stock is under conversed upon and seemingly overlooked considering the current circumstances we will be looking for outdoor family fun with all that Polaris has to offer. Don’t miss the boat ladies and gentlemen.
"Well, I just bought 20 more shares on the dip."
"Analyst Actions: Raymond James Adjusts Price Target on Polaris Industries to $162 From $147, Maintains Strong Buy RatingDate March 22, 2021"
great stock
"I am a Polaris Dealer and I can say is do not bet against them, especially in the next 12-24 months. They are in a much better position than any/all competitors to capitalize on the record demand, and with very little aged product they don’t have to rebate. They are also smartly targeting first responders and military buyers with their Heroes Advantage program and they have the best offering of OEM accessories period. There will certainly be an upgrade cycle for those buyers who decide to stick with their new form of recreation, so this could boost Polaris fortunes over the next 2, 3, 4 years or more... In addition, they are investing heavily in people, tools and programs to ensure that dealers are taking full advantage of all 5 profit centers. Oh, and let’s not forget the healthy dividend..."
"Problem is everybody is making a side bye side's, Yamaha YXZ 1000 is the hot ticket in the dunes, sounds better shifting like a race car, and no 200.00 belts to replace all the time. Good luck longs"
"Hello troll shorties. Once again in the next week or 2 please bring it down to $1.20 so I could add more to when I bought mine.I have 50K cash I'm willing go give you for your shares. LESS TALK PLEASE I'm giving you 2 weeks. That's more than enough, right? While I celebrate CNY. Happy NIO year!"
"Headed down, beneficiary of high incomes in the energy industry, guys buying dirt bikes etc..bikes, now over 600K people have been laid off. What happens long run, headed to $55."
Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI. http://www.foxchart.com/share/623623270.png
"Peaked, not much else"
this stock highly leveraged since their boat purchase. almost two billion in debt. i don't know how good a purchase that was. i thought they should have gone another route. now the stock is suffering.
"pii slingshot design very good very beautiful and very attractive,I think it's sales sure be very good,I saw snowmobile off road EV design very good, it will be reach$500,,"
Polaris is down 5.15% to 119.76
"I have bought 9 new Polaris snowmobiles in the last 5 years. I ride 6000 miles a year and I can tell you, I have had 0 problems. I have been riding for 15 years now and know how maintain my machines. Polaris is getting very close to SkiDoo in ride quality, but is bar none a far better quality machine than SkiDoo. My riding group all rides Polaris and we refuse to ride with SkiDoo guys because of the poor quality of their machines. BRP has a lot of work to do in the Reliability department. I am not partial to any brand as I Rode Yamaha for many years, but I can tell you, from MUCH experience that Polaris has Hands Down the best quality built 2 stroke sled On the market right now. This is NOT an opinion."
"Interesting reaction to Polaris' earnings today... News of furloughs and other negatives as well. Yet the stock is up a decent amount in an overall slightly down market day right now. While I'm long PII shares I honestly have no idea where this should be trading right now. I do know I'm not buying no2, but was buying heavily throughout the $40's and high-$30's."
To think I was going to buy some puts this morning. Glad I didn't have the funds. Maybe tomorrow.
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
The stock is at a 5 yr low based on the impact of tarriffs i believe. I heard $50M so the good news is the dividend and hopefully the trade war subsides and/or adjustments are made to counter the increased costs. I suspect some fears of a slowing economy as well.
PII is down 16.06% to 57.52
Pay to play
Honda announced a sport utility vehicle to go against the RZR a few days ago. Also was downgraded today. I did buy some call options today. Haven't seen PII this low for a very long time.
a motorcycle based on an alcoholic beverage - gotta be a great talking point with the officer should you get pulled over for speeding ..lol
"it is a big loss, and the market reacted ..there is uncertainty right now ...once they find a successor and restore confidence the stock will bounce back.. companies like polaris that are high quality typically have a deep bench of talent to draw from. key for me is whether they get someone from inside. i would feel better knowing it is someone from inside being promoted ..."
"i love pii as a company and think the share price is very reasonable. but what happens when the govt stops its easy money policy, stops the handouts, and renters have to pay their rents again? the market is forward looking, so you cant look at today and value company based on current situation. that is probably reason for low valuations. of course the markets could be wrong."
hedge fundsa are dumping polaris ...that means buy .... hedge funds for most part are only good at losing clinets' money and taking oversized fees for doing it ...
"Hope this helps.. Love JD. Went to a C Ms dealership on hwy 51. Spoke with a sales person. Very unimpressed with Deere. Gators, no selection, overpriced, no energy sales force. Went some 30 miles north 51 to a Polaris dealership, no inventory, no Rangers, nada nothing. Told an 18 month back up and I would have to pre order with a 4-->6 week ship date, I did. Great deals for farmers, J Deere, not so much. About a $2,000 difference. Problem here is you can not sell what you do not have. Inventory is gone alone with thoes sales. I see a gap because of the issues associated with these northern states being shut down for so long. Today, furniture, a utility trailer, all sales lost opptunities from a covid related gap. Can not buy what I can not find. I like PII vs Deere, but @ half this price. Again you can not sell what you do not have......"
Polaris is up 5.55% to 136.66
"Scott, read your reply and Arcimoto is perfect fit. Should write the company. That type of vehicle is gonna take off once price comes down if they can get scale. right now $20K and they want to get it down to $12K. PII can give them that scale... PII should buy or invest in them. Preferably buy them ..."
I was just in to get my jet ski served and asked what happened to all the 4 wheelers and jet skis they told me they were completely sold out and it was a first ever.... Bought calls on that knowledge lets see how we do...
"Perhaps, customers switch from HOG to PII, well I would:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/harley-plans-ship-fewer-models-133044242.html"
"Earnings summary: $1.0B in rev, 40% growth YOY, EPS of $2.57, 77.2% growth YOY. These are absolutely staggering numbers. I guess one could consider this growth temporary as the RV boom wanes, but I highly doubt that is the case for a couple reasons: A) there is a cohort of boomers who are retiring, some retiring early, to enjoy life and travel, but don't want to fly or cruise with Covid-19 still around, so are buying RVs to see the country (like my parents). B) young families (like mine) are camping and RVing as the new normal trip, vacation or long weekend C) people who live on lakes or on the coast are never going to stop buying boats, whether Chris Craft or Barletta. You could say the same about $BC as a cheap, wise investment right now.Furthermore, as I said earlier, Winnebago is eating Thor's lunch. Literally taking market share with better quality products, better business decisions and better finances. While $THO was issuing new notes to raise capital, $WGO was boosting dividend by 50% and approving $200M buyback. I mean, if that's not financial strength, I'm not sure what is.This takes our current PE to 8.46 and our future PE to 7.27 assuming 25% growth next quarter. Every quarter we set new records while the stock treads water because people are too busy chasing unprofitable technology to the moon.I've said this before. We've suffered various downgrades on the great outdoors and related products. I think these are way overdue for a huge rally when people realize these activities and sports are here to stay. $ASO $DKS $PII $HMC $VSTO $BC $WGO $THO $CWH $LCII"
"My sources from the inside say that absolutely nothing has changed and nobody really cares about the departure. I certainly don’t think that it will affect the demand for their products. Long term strategy will stay the same, as the board didn’t change. It’s a solid company with real revenues and earnings, unlike some other hyped brand.."
Polaris is up 4.93% to 134.42
Now time to see how the market reacts to this..
still no one cares about this
PII is up 4.93% to 123.60
What a joke
why is this going down? sales are threw the roof with dealer having low inventory.

"breakout soon, forward pe 13, underestimated, closer to 10 imho."
awesome
Haven't they had a lot of recalls lately?
Good Lord! I'd hate to see what would've happened to the price if they'd missed. Crazy reaction.
electric cycles with automatic transmission will be huge.
been buying since 39 told all you haters this would have great earnings ...
"American companies have had over a year to prepare for this. Those that didn't are at fault for their losses. There are other low cost manufacturing countries that are friendly to US that would be happy manufacturing products for the US. We need to counter balance power in that region by making other countries there stronger. There will be some necessary pain in the process, but we've been suckers for too long. Good for Trump. Finally someone with some cahunas."
we need some BAD news so the stock can go up.
Very undervalued
No reason for the stock price to be going down. They had a great quarter.
"Why would anybody in their right mind own an over priced vechicle from POLARIS! Poor products and parts,with a recall list on about 85 vechicles. People need to be smarter and do their homework,before buying anything Polaris."
"if they report poor earnings and stock drops, it may be good buying opportunity. china issue will pass before the election. trump timing it so he can save the day before the votes are tallied. so, i watch and wait. pii is a good company in a bad predicament..."
"Optimus Ride and Polaris partnership announced today. There will be a HUGE market for GEM vehicles, but expect a ton of competition in the space. I myself would like one to get around town. I have an SUV and we don't need a full size second vehicle, just something for more local use like food shopping and going into town for errands. Good move by PII, -"
With the pandemic people are going to buy Polaris snowmobiles like no get out this season. Target CEO Brian Cornell is a Polaris believer and was on their board--he lives near the Polaris HQ. Buy in $97.27
"(Stolen from Stocktwits but a quality post I thought I would share) $PII Polaris continually overlooked in the EV space. Have direct competitors to the ""new"" personal use EV plays coming to market.. $SOLO, $FUV, $AYRO. (Not knocking the aforementioned.. have been in all of them since the start of the year). For those interested check out these companies in the Polaris Group: GEM, Goupil, and Taylor-Dunn. Also EV motorbikes? Read about their partnership with Zero. Polaris already leads the way with fully electric non-street legal vehicles (ex. the electric Ranger). Imo it is only a matter of time until the start hyping and focusing in on-road vehicles. https://www.polaris.com/en-us/news/company/polaris-announces-zero-motorcycles-partnership/"
they can't keep inventory in stock guys on wall Street don't know whats.goimg at dealer's this will crush earnings over and over
PII reached a new 52 Week Low at $99.40
just got notice from Polaris that they are almost out of snowmobiles for next year yes you read that right the have the snow check orders and are almost sold out for 2022 this stock is going to go through the roof
"I'm not following stock drops 10 percent on doing well , don't school me on earnings baked in the pie what the logic?"
"idk, compared to other companies in this industry, their financials are pretty good, especially compared to $PII :shrug:"
"Sport side bye side has huge competition. everybody making one. Can Am, Yamaha, Honda, Kawasaki, even John Deer. good luck this summer. to many problems coming up."
Orders through the roof on side by side off road vehicles
Re: When.sDaSp.o..
Lol so over sold just added to my position long term no brainer dealers are sold out
i think they should make small affordable EV just to get around town with. for short trips.
Insider buying
I expected a more definitive announcement than an interim CEO. Is there some disagreement going on with the Board?
Does anyone know what might be causing the +4% move up today?
CEO announcement and translation day must be expected any day at this point?
Added another 100 share at $128.99 no brainer
supply chain ..... a lot of companies will take a hit on this ...but those issues will fade sometime next year ... so i am not concerned .
"Nice price to start building a position. They are spending this year redoing sourcing and product development. No large acquisitions planned, but spending on future efficiency. What great brands!"
"Way to go Polaris, my cousin is the CEO and he has turned this company around"
PII is down -9.83% to 108.20
Great analyst day presentation. Future looking good!
"i am a PII shareholder and politically agnostic. On this matter I support Trump 100%. I've lost money when one of my stocks had its IP stolen by a Chinese company {AMSC vs. Sinoval}. I wouldn't be the first. China steals our IP, forces US companies into unfair partnerships in order to do business in China. They have abysmal human rights record, are aggressive toward their neighbors in South China Sea, and they believe democratic Taiwan belongs to them. China does not share our values and they are not our friend. Be very wary of China."
Pre Market opening in green + 2.59%. Will be good today
consumer stocks down - with end of free unemployment money handouts and pandemic relief it is anticipated that there will be a drop in spending. throw in the end of the rent moratorium and amount of money consumers have to spend will drop. i am not so sure this stock should be hit so hard though. PII products are expensive and most likely purchased by those with strong discretionary income. i think we are bottoming and those expectations are now mostly built in. glta
"I rage-deleted all my YF posts during one of the recent market selloffs, but I'm coming here second to start over. $WGO is my favorite holding, but it has underperformed this year. I'm not sure why. I suspect people think the RV boon is over and everyone is going back to cruising tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, which still hasn't happened. 30% of the US isn't vaccinated. A grand total of ZERO American kids under 12 are vaccinated.But none of that really matters, because families have picked up new hobbies and vacations over the last year. They rented and purchased RVs, boats, ATVs, golf clubs and other outdoor sports. I've RVed with my kids for almost 10 years. I have neighbors and friends coming up to ask how we like it, how to tow, where we go, etc. This isn't a dying fad. It's the new norm. $THO just blew out estimates and cited increasing demand, but then offered stock which shows why Winnie is a significantly better investment IMO. Plus WInne has diversification with Chris Craft and Barletta Pontoons. Plus Winnie makes a better product than Jayco. And on the back of most boats is a Mercury thanks to $BC. $PII $CWH $HZOSupply chain issues for all of these companies may exist, but will abate. People aren't going to stop buying toys for their lake properties or camping trips. In fact, every time we've bought an RV, we've wanted the next size/step up. We went from pop up to hybrid to travel trailer. So people are basically lifelong customers."
PII is down -6.77% to 112.64
Idk but many people slept on this stock I bought at 39 and look where it is now. I don't think it's going away as a business either but what do I know.
how long will it take them to buy back $1B in stock? That is a large share repurchase planned. And the shares are not so cheap any more. Wondering if there was a better use of their capital ...
odd that the stock has been declining. i would think buyers of polaris products are not so much dependent on stimulus. these are people with a decent amount of disposable income. that is my thinking anyways. a $1200 stimulus check isn't gonna sway someone one way or the other ..
"i think they should make small affordable EV just to get around town with. for short trips. I say this 'cause I live in a small town, as many do, and I don't need a fancy car to do grocery's and errands and most of the things i do on a typical day. I don't want to drive a motorcycle ..I can't carry groceries on a motorcycle. A small EV vehicle would do the trick. And when we get autonomous vehicles, it can help transport people around town. Right now there is a dial-a-bus. But you have to share a bus and call ahead to schedule."
Does anybody else play this stock in buying in the low 80s and selling in the low to mid 90s - cycle after cycle... look at the chart - it has been a 10-12% short term gain play forever ? I can't explain it.. and get a little div as well...
why is Polaris down big today
PII is down 11.02% to 39.81
Polaris is up 6.39% to 103.99
Anyone else a member of (http://greatstox.xyz)? They just mentioned PII.
"pii sales can long-term growth., it can reach$250 this year"
"wow -pii lost their ceo ...he was a great ceo ... a big loss ..big shoes to fill. i don't get the appeal of going to CNHI ..it is loaded with debt ..it must be the paycheck he's gonna get ...and who knows what kind of stock options ...well, hope they find a good replacement from within - i am sure they have a lot of good people."
"My dealer has no inventory, they are selling everything they get, and every unit they have coming in.The market thinks this is a blip, but the new riders I talk to are passionate, and spending.You have to order those high margin accessories once you have your ride."
"Polaris CEO said the China tariffs expected to start Friday would cut 1/3 of the companies profits and would cause them to move manufacturing to Mexico like their competitors. Polaris has asked for tariff exception for their products, but what good are tariffs if you do them selectively by company. Only mention to how how impactful these tariffs may be, even to a company like Polaris who does their manufacturing here in the U.S.."
EARNINGS REPORT COMMENT:How is it that the company spent about $300M to buy in about 2.5M shares and yet the number of shares outstanding have increased year over year? The stock holder's equity has declined too. And yet the company reports this great profit. Are the shareholders really getting any benefit from this profit or is it the management? Is the income reporting skewed? Perhaps that is why the share price has dropped about 5% since this report.
"Look at the YTD chart, there seems to be strong resistance at $90. It has bounced back off ~$90 about five times since May. I've bought shares twice now at $90, but no options yet. If the CEO's departure pushes it down around $90 again, I think I will pick up some $95 calls for 2-3 months out."
nice picked up 100 shares at 89
"Look at the growth in FOXF, this market for off road sport vehicles is strong."
"Made another contribution to Polaris stock price on Wednesday. Bought a new Polaris sled. I now own 3 Polaris XCR’s, 2 XC Indys, 1 INDY SP, and a Sportsman Quad. Maybe I have a problem? "
i think polaris should buy tesla
"Thanks for the cheap shares today. Listened to the call, explained all of my questions thoroughly. These guys understand the market and give conservative views for future results. 2018 looks like a good year to come. Think I'll hold onto my shares and continue to buy a few. Deal today."
"Cool: RTX laser weapon, mounted on Polaris buggy:https://www.raytheonintelligenceandspace.com/news/feature/answer-laser-dune-buggy"
initiate a long position today. target 120 in fall
Polaris should buy Elio Motors. it's a great concept gas or electric
"PII can reach$500 per share,because it's sales keeping continue growth never stop,"
"PII could crush it, based on POOL today. Different markets, but recreation the same."
If Biden removes tariffs China should be nice addition to PII earnings.
"they were over $120 until they made a boat purchase ...then all downhill ... or should I say downstream ... I wasn't thrilled then and i'm not thrilled with it now .... I would rather they move into the EV market, maybe from joint venture with an up and coming company in that area, then buy a boat maker ..."
"great q, sell the news and put your money where? added a bit here at 130.25 .. long term holding..."
Just got shares at 88.75. Was that a good idea or bad?
lot of Harley Users are boycotting Harley Davidson because they are Trump voters and they plan to not buy more Harleys. Shouldn't this be good for Polaris and their Indian brand of Motorcycles?
The way this thing is crashing there must be more bad news coming out. This is worse then the cruise ship industry.
got my buy order back in for $85.
"Now that Trump is Mad at Harley, all Republicans must turn in their Harley motorcycles and buy Indians or Victory Cyles and PII will soar imo..."
Under $100 soon. No support until then.
It's the boat acquisition
"big up today, great preso on CNBC this morning with CEO. Looking for a decent entry in low 80's, up 6% right now."
"Polaris is likely to report an impact from the tariffs this quarter and I expect some soft guidance due to interest rates and continued tariff pressures. However, they have increased prices some what and made adjustments to the supply chain to address these cost going forward. I think the stock is a screaming buy here trading at 6 yr lows. The RZR is way out in front of the pack when it comes to ORV. The boat business I was never a huge fan of but I trust management. Longer term with a history of growing the dividend and trading at 12X trailing 12 months and 8X 2020 projected EPS it seem like its getting close to a buy range."
