a motorcycle based on an alcoholic beverage - gotta be a great talking point with the officer should you get pulled over for speeding ..lol
Under $100 soon. No support until then.
i wonder how much supply chain issues impacted pii. that is all i see in the headlines from other companies.
supply chain ..... a lot of companies will take a hit on this ...but those issues will fade sometime next year ... so i am not concerned .
"Earnings summary: $1.0B in rev, 40% growth YOY, EPS of $2.57, 77.2% growth YOY. These are absolutely staggering numbers. I guess one could consider this growth temporary as the RV boom wanes, but I highly doubt that is the case for a couple reasons: A) there is a cohort of boomers who are retiring, some retiring early, to enjoy life and travel, but don't want to fly or cruise with Covid-19 still around, so are buying RVs to see the country (like my parents). B) young families (like mine) are camping and RVing as the new normal trip, vacation or long weekend C) people who live on lakes or on the coast are never going to stop buying boats, whether Chris Craft or Barletta. You could say the same about $BC as a cheap, wise investment right now.Furthermore, as I said earlier, Winnebago is eating Thor's lunch. Literally taking market share with better quality products, better business decisions and better finances. While $THO was issuing new notes to raise capital, $WGO was boosting dividend by 50% and approving $200M buyback. I mean, if that's not financial strength, I'm not sure what is.This takes our current PE to 8.46 and our future PE to 7.27 assuming 25% growth next quarter. Every quarter we set new records while the stock treads water because people are too busy chasing unprofitable technology to the moon.I've said this before. We've suffered various downgrades on the great outdoors and related products. I think these are way overdue for a huge rally when people realize these activities and sports are here to stay. $ASO $DKS $PII $HMC $VSTO $BC $WGO $THO $CWH $LCII"
"I rage-deleted all my YF posts during one of the recent market selloffs, but I'm coming here second to start over. $WGO is my favorite holding, but it has underperformed this year. I'm not sure why. I suspect people think the RV boon is over and everyone is going back to cruising tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day, which still hasn't happened. 30% of the US isn't vaccinated. A grand total of ZERO American kids under 12 are vaccinated.But none of that really matters, because families have picked up new hobbies and vacations over the last year. They rented and purchased RVs, boats, ATVs, golf clubs and other outdoor sports. I've RVed with my kids for almost 10 years. I have neighbors and friends coming up to ask how we like it, how to tow, where we go, etc. This isn't a dying fad. It's the new norm. $THO just blew out estimates and cited increasing demand, but then offered stock which shows why Winnie is a significantly better investment IMO. Plus WInne has diversification with Chris Craft and Barletta Pontoons. Plus Winnie makes a better product than Jayco. And on the back of most boats is a Mercury thanks to $BC. $PII $CWH $HZOSupply chain issues for all of these companies may exist, but will abate. People aren't going to stop buying toys for their lake properties or camping trips. In fact, every time we've bought an RV, we've wanted the next size/step up. We went from pop up to hybrid to travel trailer. So people are basically lifelong customers."
consumer stocks down - with end of free unemployment money handouts and pandemic relief it is anticipated that there will be a drop in spending. throw in the end of the rent moratorium and amount of money consumers have to spend will drop. i am not so sure this stock should be hit so hard though. PII products are expensive and most likely purchased by those with strong discretionary income. i think we are bottoming and those expectations are now mostly built in. glta
"Polaris is likely to report an impact from the tariffs this quarter and I expect some soft guidance due to interest rates and continued tariff pressures. However, they have increased prices some what and made adjustments to the supply chain to address these cost going forward. I think the stock is a screaming buy here trading at 6 yr lows. The RZR is way out in front of the pack when it comes to ORV. The boat business I was never a huge fan of but I trust management. Longer term with a history of growing the dividend and trading at 12X trailing 12 months and 8X 2020 projected EPS it seem like its getting close to a buy range."
Polaris is down 5.15% to 119.76
"Hope this helps.. Love JD. Went to a C Ms dealership on hwy 51. Spoke with a sales person. Very unimpressed with Deere. Gators, no selection, overpriced, no energy sales force. Went some 30 miles north 51 to a Polaris dealership, no inventory, no Rangers, nada nothing. Told an 18 month back up and I would have to pre order with a 4-->6 week ship date, I did. Great deals for farmers, J Deere, not so much. About a $2,000 difference. Problem here is you can not sell what you do not have. Inventory is gone alone with thoes sales. I see a gap because of the issues associated with these northern states being shut down for so long. Today, furniture, a utility trailer, all sales lost opptunities from a covid related gap. Can not buy what I can not find. I like PII vs Deere, but @ half this price. Again you can not sell what you do not have......"
hedge fundsa are dumping polaris ...that means buy .... hedge funds for most part are only good at losing clinets' money and taking oversized fees for doing it ...
"I'll post one more summary for anyone surfing around or considering these names. Investors have written off recreational products as dead. Most of these trade in the low teens or single digits, which is a serious discount to the market. Comps may be tough, but business is still booming. Consumers have records amount of savings to spend in the next year. Supply chain problems are working themselves out. Backlogs will take two to three years just to restock to historical levels. With some of these stocks, simple PE expansion to the normal ratios mean they would almost double.I would even lump outdoor products like $JOUT and $VSTO and autos like $F and $GM in here too. Totally unloved and poised for huge upside in the next 12 months.$WGO $THO $BC $PII $HOG $LCII $PATK $MBUU $MCFT $HMC"
EARNINGS REPORT COMMENT:How is it that the company spent about $300M to buy in about 2.5M shares and yet the number of shares outstanding have increased year over year? The stock holder's equity has declined too. And yet the company reports this great profit. Are the shareholders really getting any benefit from this profit or is it the management? Is the income reporting skewed? Perhaps that is why the share price has dropped about 5% since this report.
Dca monthly don’t care about price long term play just loaded up
"Polaris CEO said the China tariffs expected to start Friday would cut 1/3 of the companies profits and would cause them to move manufacturing to Mexico like their competitors. Polaris has asked for tariff exception for their products, but what good are tariffs if you do them selectively by company. Only mention to how how impactful these tariffs may be, even to a company like Polaris who does their manufacturing here in the U.S.."
"Optimus Ride and Polaris partnership announced today. There will be a HUGE market for GEM vehicles, but expect a ton of competition in the space. I myself would like one to get around town. I have an SUV and we don't need a full size second vehicle, just something for more local use like food shopping and going into town for errands. Good move by PII, -"
i think polaris should buy tesla
"i love pii as a company and think the share price is very reasonable. but what happens when the govt stops its easy money policy, stops the handouts, and renters have to pay their rents again? the market is forward looking, so you cant look at today and value company based on current situation. that is probably reason for low valuations. of course the markets could be wrong."
"My sources from the inside say that absolutely nothing has changed and nobody really cares about the departure. I certainly don’t think that it will affect the demand for their products. Long term strategy will stay the same, as the board didn’t change. It’s a solid company with real revenues and earnings, unlike some other hyped brand.."
"i think they should make small affordable EV just to get around town with. for short trips. I say this 'cause I live in a small town, as many do, and I don't need a fancy car to do grocery's and errands and most of the things i do on a typical day. I don't want to drive a motorcycle ..I can't carry groceries on a motorcycle. A small EV vehicle would do the trick. And when we get autonomous vehicles, it can help transport people around town. Right now there is a dial-a-bus. But you have to share a bus and call ahead to schedule."
