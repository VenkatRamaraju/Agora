Paycom was hacked. Heads up
"Zacks waited some years to say this stock is a buy, what an advise..."
Does anyone think this is a buy in after hours at this price? It seems like an overreaction to what was a decent ER report?
"Shorts like to lean on the lofty PE ratio as a reason to bet against this name. They don't take into account that this company is turning a profit and is net income positive, their gross profit margins are greater than 85 percent, their debt is low and they have infinitely more net cash than they have debt. And finally, they are free cash flow positive and the free cash flow is 3 times the debt. Bottom line, they can pay down all their debt and still have plenty of cash left over. And finally, they have a competitive advantage in the way their software is revolutionizing the workplace. These are cheap prices compared to where it has traded. I predict 500 and above are in the company's future. There is very little to dislike here."
Bought this at 40 and rode all the way till 220 and then felt it was overvalued.Should have kept some.
Paycom Software reached an all time high at 539.68
Bonds on the rise....time to dump these over inflated growth stocks
"08/16/2019 Paycom Ranks No. 6 on Fortune’s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies ListPaycom is the highest-ranking software company on this year's list with Q2 revenues up 31% .....Nothing seems to have changed, and if true, is drop in price really warranted?"
Surprising so few shares of this company change hands. Been in 3 months and has gone up almost 100 a share
SOB. Did I hallucinated that it was 13+% after market close and now gone?
"I am no expert by any means, but I have heard that after a lengthy run up, sometimes institutions, fund managers, etc.. take advantage of the increased liquidity that occurs after an earnings report release to make adjustments and sell portions of their holdings. I have seen good stocks retreat after a good report and generally assume this is the cause, particularly when they rebound quickly. Who knows, food for thought. In any case, I still see PAYC hitting new highs. Looks like a good buy below its 50-day MA."
This stock is amazing and nobody knows about it
"From CEO on earnings call last night: “In fact, Q2 was our best quarter ever from a new business sales perspective by a large margin, and we will continue to spend aggressively on advertising throughout Q3 and Q4 above the Q2 levels as we deliver our value proposition to our massive target market. With less than 5% of the total addressable market already captured, we have a long way to go.”"
Any reason for the 10% premarket drop? Can’t find anything.
Up $9+ after hours…
"Zacks estimate. ""Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Paycom this season.""Oopsy."
Where are all the longs on this board? Any longs with good data? We have broken past 300+ like I was clamoring about. Would love to have intelligent conversations about this company but haven't had any interest in discussion.
My PAYC Share Price Guess is that it will be $400+ by the end of 2020. Best of luck to all the longs!

"PAYC reported good 1st qtr results. However, they are unable to give forward guidance because of Corona. They did say earnings going forward would be hurt by decrease in client count. So the stock is getting hit in after hours. 224 at this moment."
