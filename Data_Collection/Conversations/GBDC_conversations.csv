"Ok it looks like we need to vote our shares for the GBIC merger. I skimmed the materials and they are overwhelming. GBIC holders (which is not listed) upon conversion will own the majority of GBDC. Their assets are more risky IE CLOs, floating rates etc. FEES seem to be unchanged and for whatever the TRUE reason is for this, I DO NOT KNOW. Since management personnel are the same. The usual cost synergies are mentioned, etc. Dividend will increase by .01.Yada Yada. More shares issued and maybe a class of preferred. SO, if anyone follows GBDC and has any idea why this is happening, please share your view point.TIA J-E-Ts"
