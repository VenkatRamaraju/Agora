That most recent article on AXTI is obviously a move to cause a dip for someone to get in lower. I believe we will have good report and will surpass $7 or $8 soon
is this stock gonna pop off tomorrow?
EPS - $0.10 - BEATRevenue - $28.6 million - BEAT
"Barring a macro/global meltdown, this company looks poised for great gains over the next year. I’ve been watching for a while and think it’s time to dip in."
I’m looking for a slow and steady climb from now to the earnings.
"Short shares increased again, another 300,000+. Combined with the last reporting period, that is an additional 750,000 short shares in the last month. Bummer, it it is what it is."
Mid line expectation is 16 dollars a share. High end is 20 a share.
"At some point the shorts will be caught flat footed. It might take a few more quarters but when the revenues start to grow the stock will bounce aggressively. Be patient and buy on weakness, this is a sure thing in my opinion. Its not a matter of if, its a matter of when."
AXTI beats estimates again 3 for 3. Revenue came in at $19.8 million and net loss for the quarter was 2 cents per share (instead of the analyst consensus for a loss of 3 cents per share). Things looking even better for next quarter.
"What a gift, adding today. It will take a few quarters to see the revenue growth but once we do, 8:00 should be a slam dunk."

Can anyone explain today's current decline?
"My take: 3rd and 4th qtr 2017 were very good. Q1 2018 in line with 4th qtr 2017...which was and is good. They see no impending weakness in the markets that Axti serves. They are qualifying substrates at the new facility. This is the beginning of a long, growth cycle. There is no growth of 3D sensing in the forecasts, until they start seeing firm orders. One analyst suggested mgt was being conservative. Mr. Fischer agreed. Mgt does not like to be overly aggressive in their estimates. They did not provide much in the way of specifics, other than....the growth is coming, just not exactly sure from where, and when. It's coming, and Axti is basically one of three companies that can provide the products in commercial quantity.Will the stock sell off tomorrow, because the world wanted more? I suspect it might. If I had spare money, I'd buy. I'm tapped out right now."

"Still no news. I have Oiim stock also, and all of a sudden, it is acting just like Axti also. Maybe small cap stocks with any kind of chip exposure getting hit as a group by funds, due to chip shortages"
Nice pop back to the recent highs. Reassuring. Still got mojo.

"I bought in, but the stock continues to slide.. any ideas?"
We took a position today at $6. The huge volume increase in options at $7:50 for October show the stock is going much higher
Interesting article on 5G.Some of the same points Morris has mentioned.https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/now-get-5g-cell-networks-152206866.html
Stock ran up too fast without much to support it. Projected EPS for next quarters and next year are still quite paltry. AXTI is likely headed back to $3.50 per share.

AXTI beats by .02 revs up
"Found something interesting on Digitimes, dated Thursday, 5/24/18: Landmark Opto, who is a customer of Axti, stated the following: strong growth momentum in 3D sensing, data center and silicon photonics. Pon market is recovering, and will go from 10% of business to 30% of business in Q2. Wafers have been qualified by a number of customer, assuring growth for next two years. Not saying this is the reason for the move up, but it is interesting nonetheless."
"Good to know that telecom and datacom and cloud, which are major applications of AXTI's wafers are all becoming far more important and are critical while the world works from home.Industry analyst Dell’Oro expects greater cloud data center capex in 2020The current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic may help push cloud spending upwards this year, Stephen HardyMar 31st, 2020 Cloud data center capex, should grow at a faster rate in 2020 than last year, Dell'Oro Group predicts in a newly released report. The market research firm states in its latest Cloud Data Center Capex Quarterly ReportThe current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic may help push cloud spending upwards this year, says a Dell’Oro analyst. ""Despite recent market uncertainties, we anticipate the Tier 1 cloud service providers to increase data center capex as planned, primarily on servers, as the sector seeks to resume capacity expansion,"" said Baron Fung, research director at Dell'Oro. ""We project a steep decline in enterprise IT spending due to severe near-term supply and demand disruptions from COVID-19. Enterprises will seek to conserve capital during these uncertain times, and resort to the cloud to satisfy near-term demand for digital services. We expect that the cloud service providers will need to expand their infrastructure at a measured pace to capture this incremental demand.""Dell’Oro expects spending on servers to compose 47% of data center capex in 2020. Looking back at 2019, the market research firm states that Amazon Web Services maintained a 50% share of cloud revenues, while Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform gained share. The Cloud Data Center Capex Quarterly Report covers the capital spending of each of the 10 largest cloud service providers."

I'm buying or at least trying right now !
"I read the conference call minutes over the weekend, and just listened to the same call. My overall take: sorry for the brevity in advance, but Morris, for once was very optimistic, excited as ever, looking forward to the future. History has shown, mgt is conservative to a fault, so they are probably conservative again in their guidance. But there is some excitement on a going forward basis, that they don't usually convey. This probably isn't a get rich quick company, but is more a lumpy (slightly higher highs, slightly higher lows) type of investment, which in the long run, at today's levels, will provide a decent return, in the intermediate term. I like where I'm at."
One month chart !!  
Target price between $8-$10 ?
"For those who take the time to listen to the conference call, you know good things are coming. Raw material which AXTI has a stake in is going up, this will add to the EPS. There is a shortage of material in the market which means demand is way up and prices are firming up. The new FAB will make AXTI's value go up for any prospective buyer. My view is the founder is working on his exit plan which might be 5 years out but regardless, he will cash out at much higher prices. My prediction is we will see AXTI at 12 to 14 dollars by year end and 14 to 17 by end of 2019. I feel very comfortable that the best is yet to come now that the market needs the sort of products that AXTI is manufacturing. GLTA."
Did I read this right? 5 cent EPS vs 2 cent expected?
why isnt AXTI in gallium nitride ?? seem to be the new hot thing - faster transmission & lower power usage
yawn... no one is around.
"Well, I didn't see that correction coming. If I had some balls, I'd mortgage the house and buy more shares. Unfortunately, that will not happen. I like a paid in full house. But boy is it tempting at these prices. I see no concrete reason for the Axti correction."
".......This was dated June 1, 2018 from Semiconductor Today.

"8.00 dollars is a great entry price if it goes there today. The only thing that would warrant a decrease in share price would be if AXTI is having issues getting the new facility up and running. If they’re having problems the revenue would be impacted with no real understanding of when they would have the problem fixed. Outside of that situation, I don’t believe demand has a weakened at all. This should be a good opportunity based on 2018 and 2019 growth potential."

Very big move up yesterday and the impressive part was the way it held tight to the gain. Definitely something driving this. More today possibly
I see it as undervalued at $9. So it's more undervalued at $6.75!! I'm a buyer today.
what happen to all the volume i thought friday was in the Millions
Optimism comes because of strong balance sheet. Revenues were up in the most recent quarter. AXTI beat estimates is both of the two most recent quarters. And it is still very undervalued.
"Talk about getting hammered! Analyst's, brokers have down graded this stock pretty badly! I got out with a small loss of a few hundred! I find it hard to believe that a company who is growing so well get's hammered so severely on a 300K miss on revenue! WOW, my greed and belief system just got corrected. Not holding this one for a year, a few months was quite enough! Good luck all!"
"Q1 was the last quarter we will see with sub $25M revenue numbers, Q2 should be the beginning of a new growth period. HIgher capacity FAB, higher priced raw material which is an advantage for AXTI. Booming demand for exotic high performance substrates. The stars are finally aligning for AXTI, I;ve added again this week to cost average down. I still expect 8.00 to 10.00 by year end. GLTA"

I believe that WIN produces the sub components that support the VCSEL system.

Finisar to hire 200 employees, for August, 2018, so Finisar can produce an initial product for Apple. An additional 300 employees to be hired in 2019, when plant is complete. This is all related to VCSEL, of which Axti serves Finisar."
"That was a tough earnings conference call to listen too. There was a boatload of “we are poised for the future, and we are ready.....”. That being said, Axti has faced a number of headwinds. Although it could get worse, what they’ve come through was not easy to navigate....transitioning to a new manufacturing plant, the tariff war which your competitors do not have to face), and the coronavirus effect (get to that soon). Those are some tough headwinds. Despite the losses, the cash flow and balance sheet says Axti is in an okay position.The coronavirus has affected the company. There are no employees with the virus. But, the company has been limited in the amount of workers that are able to work at any one time, and end customers are being cautious. For example, if an employee has visited a highly infected area, they are quarantined for 14 days. Morris estimated Axti is at 60-65% of staffing. Inp is now greater than 50% of revenues compared to Gaas. Inp will grow this coming year. GM was adversely affected by a new product offering, which customers have demanded, 6 in wafers. GM will improve throughout the year, now that that expense has mostly been covered. Qualifications are progressing nicely. So when the tariff issue and coronavirus issue is resolved or reasonably close to resolution, and customers get back towards normal business, Axti should be in a prime position. But they are not there now. Probably realistically see improvement in Q2, not Q1.I said to myself this morning, if this tanks, down to say 3.50-3.60 range, I’m going to go find myself some money so I can buy. Those are my first impression generic thoughts."

"Hello everyone, Just like to get some view points on AXTI and the possibility of them being bought out. If AXTI is as unique as they are and with only 2-3 basic competitors. With the ramp up and possibility shortage coming in the next year or so. Wouldn't it make sense for a tier 1 customer to buy them, lock up their supply chain and, put the screws to their competitors. Morris, along with Gary Fisher have done a great job of setting up the company for the next wave but, Morris is 76 and Gary is 69. Whether they sell or not, I think AXTI is a great play long term, 3-5 years. Thanks for your thoughts."
Significant slowdown in the new economic environment. AXTI now revealed a negative surprise for their fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $22 to $22.4 million. The new surprise is significantly down from the company’s previous guidance of $26.5 to $27.5 million. LoL.
"They announced lower sales due to the smog but they didn’t talk about EPS. If the EPS comes in strong, the stock will gain based on the profit improvement. Looking forward to the earnings. Picked up more shares under 7.00, it was a great opportunity."

I sure wish I had some idea of what triggered today’s enthusiasm for AXTI?  all I could find was some dumb future conference on the company’s website. I used that new fangeled inten web thingy mah jig...
"10M shares traded is one of the all-time volume highs for AXTI??That said, this is the 3rd run-up within a month where we had a 15%+ on 5X+ average volume. Other two times stock retreated back below $5 within days.1st move 30 days ago caused by famed pump/dumper Paul Mampilly recommendation.....lemmings piled on and drove price up. FYI he is associated with Banyan Hill Publishing whose BBB rating is only 3 stars. Stock quickly retreated back below $4.90.2nd move two weeks ago caused by Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard reiterated an Outperform. Again stock retreated and settled in below $4.90****fast forward today***:3rd-move is from educated-investor/traders looking at old-and-reliable GAAS substrate providers (of which AXTI is a big player) of next-generation bio-smart-devices which MUST use red-LED (only GAAS substate works well....SI-compounds not very good within spectrum) emitters? If this is for real, AXTI could get a good bounce. :-)Maybe big buyers are shaking old longs out of stock and getting their shares cheap?"
"Jim, there are a number of things I find interesting. After hours, last night, someone bought 56,000 shares, at the closing price. I read somewhere, I think yesterday, that Apple discontinued manufacturing a number of recent iPhones, so they could concentrate manufacturing on next generation iPhone, which is head and shoulders above the most recent iPhone versions. Intel was just awarded some award where they manufactured a next gen silicon photonics material that will help transform data centers, connectivity, telecom, etc. And there are a number of articles out recently about new manufacturing plants coming online, and product being qualified for the coming demand. Why did the price spike today? Don't know. Did any of the above factor in? Don't know. But I like what I've been reading, about the long term prospects in the industry."
Did some calcs....in Jan they sold 7.28% of Tongmei to several private equity firms for 49m. That values 100% of Tongmei at 673m. Tongmei generated 81% of AXT 2020 revs. Adding an equivalent valuation of the other 19% of revs results in a consolidated value for AXTI of 830m. The MV of AXTI today was 481m. Rough calc but this implies AXTI is trading at a 42% discount.
"My son is 16. He now has a brokerage account, and a Roth Ira. He is finally taking a more active roll in investing. He came to me a month or two ago and asked to buy shares in a company with a ticker symbol of HIMX. I did the 5 minute look and said I'll buy it at some point. I finally read the 3rd quarter, 2017 earnings call transcript. I'm probably embellishing this, but it seemed like a third of what they said was 3D sensing was a game changer, and they are positioning for this revenue driver. I'm not, in no way, suggesting you purchase Himx. I bring this up because it further supports that need for what Axti produces. If lots of companies need what Axti produces, then Axti is in the right place, at the right time. Which is what Axti mgt has been saying. That is my readers digest version."

Inp usage in data centers is growing nicely. Pon sales is expected to grow at 40% annually, but will be lumpy, as in the next qtr. 3D sensing is beginning to produce, with many new applications. Gaas with autonomous cars and fiber lasers are beginning to ramp up. The current supply infrastructure cannot handle all this growth.So Axti is positioning for growth. New facility is on track and on budget. But next qtr is one of those lumpy down qtrs. Tariffs will be a minor drag. Current tariffs will cost Axti $150,000 next qtr, at 10%. If US increases tariffs to 25%, which is a possibility, then the cost goes up. This is not product altering, but is a real cost.Opx, which has been slightly elevated, is expected to continue at its current levels.All in all: good qtr, reduced short term outlook (of which 4th qtr is typically a slightly weak qtr), good long term outlook."
"Charting v good since big runup day on June 15th. Consolidation after that day expected, but would have been nice if had gone higher. But, chart wise, v good that broke that strongly over the 50 day moving average and is not unexpected stock needs to consolidate and retest the 50 day moving ave, now that stock finally got over it. That price is 10.35. Also, stock was able to get over they most recent high's from April, all signs that buying power is now overtaking selling and stock should begin nice run up now."
AXTI is up 7.52% to 7.15
10 day deep cup has formed. A handle will confirm the move higher
"Interesting research article on GaAs. Also note that in the 3rd. chart, AXTI is depicted in the center silver ring and, IQE is called out at the end which is one of AXTI’s largest customers. http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2018/jul/yole_240718.shtml"
Any Longs here? Been watching for a couple months. Joined today at 9.72. What do you think of their future with 5G?
Looks like it’s trying to bounce back. For sure did not deserve the hit it took yesterday with a good report
Over reaction.
"Well, tomorrow will be fun… consensus was 5 cents with a high estimate of 6, and we blew all of those out of the water. Increased margins, too.And with the 8-inch GaAs news, I would expect a large jump tomorrow - people did not buy the rumor here, so people should be buying the news.Eric"
"I haven't listened to the conference call yet. Plan to read it and listen to it tonight. Although the after hours volume is high, most of it was immediately after 4:00. Am pleased to see some follow up buying, after the conference call ended. I've bought a little on every .50 cent dip. Was hoping to buy more. But the planned funds coming in aren't here yet. I hate when that happens. Been following the industries that are end consumers for Axti, mostly on semiconductor today. Expected growth is still projected....just the timeframes appear to be extended. I'm still ""all in"". Usually, I invest with a 2-4 yr time horizon. This one might be 3-5, or 4-6 yrs. All in my humble opinion."
raised by BWS Financial to $20.00. buy rating.
Axti is a solid company. Who else can do what they do? Ok near term slow but heck the market is being driven by new applications that require semiconductors. More bandwidth is needed and thus will drive the market higher. Stay optimistic...
I got in at a higher level but by buying at lower I got the average down to where I made a small profit
"JeffreyT, you might get a chance to buy in the 6 dollar range again, the problem is that most people don’t. You’re selling at a time when AXTI has expanded it’s production and new customers are coming on board. Let’s see what happens in 6 months."
I’m smelling an acquisition target.
Good luck longs on tomorrow's eps report after the close
The huge gap from 9.23 to yesterday’s close will get fill quickly especially if this was a technical glitch like most are pointing to. Easy 20% gain buying from getrv
"want to sell the news, but where is the news?"
Anyone know what’s going on? Is this just a short squeeze? 16+%
Picked my shares back up (sold 20% of my holdings for $4 a few months back) for $3.21.
"Check out short interest. For the settlement date 4/30, it rose another 600,000 shares (rounding). That helps explain the decline in late April. I bought some more. Wish I could have done it a couple of weeks ago, but didn't have any cash available. Now I do."
My summary on conference call:Inventory correction is overGrowth to resumeLong term trends still in placeThis industry will always have some lumpinessIndium phosphide rocksSorry it was so long. Lol. I think I nailed it though.
Will rocket north after earnings today... Lots of accumulating
"For the technically inclined, chart shoes a beautiful cup-with-handle going back about 8 weeks. Looks like we're breaking out. Finally."
Craig-Hallum raises price target to $15 from $12
AXTI set a firm floor around $2.80 per share and now it is starting to break out upward pretty strongly.
"Has anyone been following ACMR? Believe they are first US company to list on STAR. Slated to happen this month. Should be an informative precedent on how AXT might respond to its listing, a year out notwithstanding"
Well that’s not a very rational reaction. Small caps getting rolled. If you aren’t Facebook or Apple no one cares. 8 inch news is big. Once it lists on star it’ll be $20-30.
"AXT Inc (Symbol: AXTI) July 11, 2018 saw options trading volume of 3,094 contracts, representing approximately 309,400 underlying shares or approximately 99.3% of AXTI's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 311,635 shares. Especially high volume was seen for the $15 strike call option expiring February 15, 2019 , with 1,082 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 108,200 underlying shares of AXTI."
"FNSR update, a large customer of Axti: FNSR is currently limited in production by capacity constraints. That will all change with the Sherman plant. Sherman 1st phase of the equipment is now in and operational. Some material has been qualified, other material is out for qualification, with 6 in. wafers. This is for VCSEL/3D sensing. Majority of usage is for one significant customer (think Apple). But other customers are in process. Expect to be fully operational by 12/31/18. 5g transition - Fnsr is leading supplier for OEMs (25-100g). Mgt believes they are in good position for (100-400g), beginning in 2019.This is additional evidence that demand is coming, and near. This is just one company. There are many other companies in a similar boat. They aren't building these manufacturing plants to sit idle. There are too many new products that need the basic substrates, that Axti produces. Axti mgt has stated that their product has been qualified, for the majority of their customers, but that other qualifications were still needed....down the line. This is one of those down the line customers. It appears, demand is coming. At its current price, Axti stock price appears low, given the demand that appears on the horizon, all in my humble opinion."
What is with this downtrend? Off about 12-13% in the last 3 weeks. Going down on up market days as well.
"Please read the report on Aixtron (MOCVD) Deposition Equip. Maker. AXTI does not sell to Aixtron but AXTI customes need the equipment that Aixtron builds. Hence, you can get an indication of the future demand chain. http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2021/aug/aixtron-090821.shtml"
liquid metal article out touting the revolution coming all hints point to axti could be the issue
Very impressive jump and volume for 11:00am. Something is up for sure or the shorts are covering.
"Expect revenue in Q2 of between $25.5 million and $26.5 million, profit per share in Q2 will be in the range of $0.07 to $0.09 based on 40.364 million diluted common shares outstanding."
"The last 9 trading days have been bullish. Volume lower than the previous day when the price falls, but volume higher than the previous day when the price rises. Someone is definitely accumulating. Maybe there is a surprise announcement coming up or the bottom for chip stocks is in."
This stock is a hidden gem. Why is it not moving and why is there not much attention to it?
Have to say stock behaved badly recently. Will gain some clarity in a couple of weeks.
Will close above 8.
Anyone know what happened today?Just because they replaced their Chairman?Any thoughts going forward about price?
"Charles, you have provided some nice articles and insight over my time period of investing in Axti. First off, thank you. On a going forward basis, curious as to your thoughts....going forward. I'm an ex-commercial banking underwriter. Axti's story and what I'm seeing in the fundamentals of the company, I like. The industry is beginning to take off. Axti is one of a few players that can deliver the substrate product, that is needed to deliver the end product. Axti is the supplier to companies that deliver the ""in product"". Don't know how to say that better, but the product that everyone is going to want. Those customer companies of Axti, like Lite and Fnsr, have been setup to succeed, and are on record stating they have been funded (Fnsr from Apple) or like Lite, that the business is finally here. Lots of other companies are building additional capacity to fund this growth, and it all basically comes from 1 of 3 players, with Axti being one of them. Looking at the financials, no debt, growing revenues, future revenues expected to improve materially, which means for a manufacturer, EPS is going to goosed because more drops to the bottom line, as revenues increase. In summary, the fundamentals look good, future looks good, with expectations of strong growth for the next 4+ years. I'm surprised the stock isn't higher. And I'm surprised the shorts have increased their position for the past 8 months. Curious if you would like to provide your thoughts. Personally, I don't think it's a matter of if, but when, Axti stock price improves materially."
"Come to pappa.......AXTI getting close to my ""buy trading shares"" price point.Two weeks ago I got in at $10.50....only held to $11.50 for $1 profit and missed a better run."
"5.80 might have been the bottom. It’s cheap at these levels based on 2019 sales expectations. AXTI will need to start closing in on $30M in sales quarterly. They should get there by Q1,2019. Meanwhile I expect we will get bounced around until the fall."
Cannot wait until they IPO tongmei sub at $20/share. Only 15 months to go. Valuation arbitrage will be too big to ignore then (that will be 17% of the company in total sold at $15-20/share by then including PE investment at $15. Holding on tight and writing calls until then. Some nice premiums! Wish they would then sell the other 80% of the company and complete this 10 bagger off its lows!
"Looking at the bright side, a lot of the risk associated with the earnings release has been absorbed and we hung in there pretty well. Company indicated demand picture still strong."
Indium phosphide demand (InP) is increasing both in China and outside China. 5G networks are going to require an full capacity upgrade. Both III-V lasers and silicon photonics transmitters and receivers require InP. Manufacturers are saying that silicon lasers will not happen. All silicon photonics optical devices require InP devices for the optical source and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future. Data centers are now putting optical communications within the datacenter. These are huge sources of demand for InP (far more growth than telecom). All these tx/rx within datacenters also require InP substrates for the many links that are going up in datacenters. Looks like demand for InP substrates is going strong. AXTI is in the right place at the right time. Could see $7 per share this year.
WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (at least for now).
"I was so close to selling this one because I bought it too high. Still underwater by a buck so, needless to say with positive news and positive investor sentiment I am hanging on. Hoping the larger spectrum is a tailwind for this AXTI holding . What do you guys think? Should I stay or should I go?"
Very nice results !!!!! Up up and away
"Slow and steady is what I expect the growth to be moving forward. Enjoy the predictability, your money will grow nicely with AXTI. We might even get a nice bump up at some point seeing I expect the competition to make a run for them. GLTA"
Fantastic! Just fantastic!!
"This article about InP mentions AXTI.Enjoy,,,,http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2021/sep/yole-090921.shtml"
"Well now, bright side is, at least we know what the loan is for now. See ya'll back in the 2's. Wash, rinse, repeat."
Their biggest customers iqe and landmark are near 52 week lows.
I can't find anything either. just pure guessing here: stock dilution?? a fund just dumping all their shares for whatever reason?? Insiders unloading before bad news to hit the wires?? Who knows!!!
"Solid earnings for AXTI.Beat by .02Last quarter the average P/E was 27.Applying Q2 earnings to TTM would give us a $9.72 price target for the next 3 months.Growth across all product lines.All JV’s contributed including a new use(OLED) for their PBN crucibles.Raw material prices up which AXTI has JV’s in.Many qualifications are coming in.AXTI is 20 years old this quarter and,Morris Young has never been so excited about the future of his company.The CC was very informational and the last 4-5 minutes Morris really spelled out the future(couple of years) of InP. Forecasting .08-.10 for Q3Investor conferences are Aug.28th and Sep.6th."
Excellent to see the strong revenue in Q4 and the very strong balance sheet with lots of cash. AXTI beat Q4 analyst consensus estimate by 29%. This one is headed to $6 per share in the next few months.
Any comments about the report next week?
"Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard reiterated an Outperform rating and $9.00 price target on AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ: AXTI) on news iWatch includes an oxygen sensor.The analyst notes the series 6 iWatch uses 4 lasers, 2 red and 2 infrared and the iWatch would also need detectors. He said it likely the red lasers are GaAs based and the infrared are InP based. ""We think that this is the first significant wearable health monitoring applications that have InP content,"" he commented.While Richard didn't say if AXT is the supplier for Apple, he notes it is one of the few suppliers of InP. ""We believe that AXTI'sopportunity per watch could be $0.20 to $0.50 as it likely includes both InPand GaAs lasers and detectors,"" he said.Further, the analyst believes the technic could be extended to glucose monitors in the future.For an analyst ratings summary and ratings history on AXT, Inc. click here.

"The article mentions China's new STAR market, the one that AXTI has applied to for listing as discussed in their Earnings report and CC along with Microchap on the board here. Not sure what impact this has on either AXTI or the STAR exchange but the Chinese market, according to the article, viewed it as a positive move when it was announced. Just thought I'd pass it along.https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-to-know-about-the-proposed-beijing-stock-exchange-51631022582?siteid=yhoof2"
I sold 20% of my holdings.......Rumor that Paul Mampilly recommended.....lemmings piled on and drove price up.FYI Paul Banyon BBB rating is 2-stars (out of five).Called out by BBB for questionable marketing tactics. Tooks some profits before lemings who bought 6 million shares sell their hoards?https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/delray-beach/profile/investment-advisory-services/banyan-hill-publishing-0633-92018996/customer-reviews
"Fundamentals of AXTI's rapidly growing business is enough to justify the highest PT of $20. But let's factor in a potential buy-out. Here we have an American company with deep reach into raw rare earth material in China's backyard. Since China has used rationing of rare earth to its trade benefit, what's the odd that a China company, partially owned by China Inc., would make a move?"
"I’m not sure where Gary Fischer gets the $150k per 2019 quarter number for the tariffs at 10%. But if it’s that simple, can one extrapolate and assume $375k per quarter for the 25% tariff? If AXTI can’t pass through these tariffs in their prices – by my calcs, with the 10% tariff you shave maybe $0.02 off annual EPS. With the 25% tariff ($375k/qtr) you shave $0.04 - $0.05 off. All other things being equal GM’s lose 70 and 150 basis points respectively. It’s not good but I think the market is overreacting. Next year’s consensus EPS is currently $0.50. Tariffs will push that down …but maybe not as much as people think."
Merry Christmas to all!
"87,000 on the buy at $7.00, just before the close"
"I listen to the entire call and the gave guidance of 26-27 million in the first Q and about a steady 30% to 35% profit margins going forward! There are several shorts posting negative comments that are completely FALSE and misleading! CEO & CFO are very positive and enthusiastic about the business model producing excellent numbers going into this Q 1 ! The new plant is completely positioned to operate fully functioning with their machinery and furnaces completely purchased! They will have more then half there business operating out of the new plant as well as operating in the plant they have now! They refused to GUESS AT THE NUMBERS! They repeated that they only predict what they know and report true numbers!CEO & CFO suggested they are consistent with predicting a mid 30% profit margin for 2018 year! I don’t know about any of you but, with the present numbers they are predicting mid 30% profit margin and income of 26 to 27 million per Q puts some big numbers into results!! Your looking at over 106 to 108 million in revenue for this year! I’m a buyer not a shorter!"
"Yesteray, The FCC opened up a huge chunk of radio spectrum in the 6GHz frequency band for consumer WIFI.This will add 1,200 Megahertz to Wi-Fi spectrum increasing it by nearly fivefold.This is what the handset and chipmakers are saying about this:Intel said ""most significant contribution to Wi-Fi in 20 years"".Apple said ""sets the course for the next generation of Wi-Fi networks"".Smartphone and hardware manufacturers in the US will be focusing their efforts on marketing devices that accommodate this new spectrum – branded Wi-Fi 6E.My analysis above and beyond what trade rags are saying:Copper twisted-pair and COAX wont cut it! Faster optical interfacing is needed.The Internet providers will need GAaS and InP substrate for optical components in their core routers that can provide spectrum that these devices will need. 5G punch in the face? I think so.This effectively provides the performances promised by 5G micro-towers......pushing the infrastructure costs away from cellular telephony service providers and over to the consumer and Internet providers core routers that tie into consumer WIFI routers.These new devices will need optical 1510 nm and 1600 nm which is in InP realm.InP substrates are needed in order to realize promised potential of new WIFI FCC standards.This could be a big win for AXTI. Especially if it opens doors, because of 5 fold increase in spectrum, for community WIFI routers that provide services to multiple customers or whole buildings with much reduced number of WIFI hotspots and user-routers. Why deploy 5G at all which require expensive 5G phones& expensive leases for micro-towers and costly infrastructure? This new WIFI standard competes with the primary scope of operations that micro-tower 5G addresses."
I listened to conf call after 2nd quarter results. AXT is bringing on a major new customer. The new customer is pushing them to put QA standards in place......which Axt believes will lead to other top tier customers. the raw material that will be in such demand is indium phospide. InP.
"Suggest shareholders read/study yesterday's earnings conference call. AXTI is poised to continue sustained revenue growth for many quarters to come.Key takeaways include:Completing qualification of a second(!) tier-1 customer.Diversified customer base....all less than 10% total revenue.35% growth for c 2021 for InP revenue.InP customers spread evenly across 4G, 5G, and optical applications.AXTI has been able to scale up product volumes as needed.Expected to be able to quadruple capacity due to new 2020 factories and new plans for expanding into additional buildings.IOT customer products are expected drive GaAs product demand higher.Ahead of demand curve for high volume LED GaAs 8inch substrate for uLED customer product roleout.Anticipated growth from Silicon Photonics is coming on strong.Even germanium substrate delivery is growing! Cash on hand allowing for expansion of inventories to quickly deliver product to meet customer expectations."
"This has been a lovely day. Can we do this again tomorrow? My son owns this as well. He was so excited, he texted me from school to tell me this was up......like I didn't already know......"
so company post a loss and nothing happens to share prices in fact they went up ????just dont get seems like every other company on the market losses money over and over and yet they stay in business...looks like most are better and managing loss than making profits..lol
"Bout damnnnn time!!!! Really starting to like my 7.3, 6.95, 6.5 and 6.3 recent purchases."
"Just ran across an article in Semiconductor Today. Sorry, don't know how to embed from the iPad. It's dated 7/26/18, titled IGE expects first half of 2018 revenue growth in double digits, across all major drivers. Not exact wording. In particular, qualifications going well. Expansion plans to be completed by mid 2019, photonics growth of 30%+, Vcsel/3D sensing growth greater. IQE is a large customer of Axti. There is another article dated 7/31 on 5N, which is doubling its production capacity in Canada. 3 of the 5 metals are Gaas, germanium and indium. Don't think Axti has a relationship with them, or if they are a competitor. Don't know. But it speaks to the coming growth that everyone is forecasting.One other takeaway was, as the market for these materials progress, its smartphones today and immediate future, with a transition to automotive tomorrow."
why is this dropping so much!?
The line of credit is puzzling me as well. My first reaction is to worry that they lost a big customer and need the money to pay the bills in the short term. The other scenario is that they expect to be so busy that they need extra funds to buy raw materials to fulfill the larger order volume. We will know for sure in February when the earnings call occurs. I hope it’s for growth purposes.
"Their expenses went way up last quarter, but they still nearly doubled their earnings from a year ago. Tremendous revenue growth, clean balance sheet, no debt, and they're stacking bills daily. No one likes the conservative guidance? Under-promise and over-deliver, I say. This company is quietly killing it. If I were Google or Apple, this is exactly the sort of company I'd try to buy. Good luck longs!"
"I know I am a novice, but with all the chip makers on a total tear, how is AXTI keep heading down? Zacks, Stocks under $10 picker service, made it a sell today and I decided to hold. They gave no reason to sell, except the trend down. Thoughts?"
AXT is up 8.18% to 10.05
"I just googled different combinations of words such as pollution control business shutdown Beijing 2018, etc. Probably read 12-15 articles. This is basically a winter only issue, and has been for a number of years. Beijing is surrounded on 3 sides by mountains, and the smog can't get out. The government proposed and is partially funding reduction in smog, both in Beijing and Hebei (where new facility is). This is a 5 yr plan, which started a few years ago to attain clean air in the region. Residential is being switched over to natural gas, more electric transportation, higher emission standards on steel production, aluminum production. The government mandated the improvements to be achieved for each successive year. Having been to Beijing, about 4 years ago, I can tell you that at the end of the day, you had soot on your face, if you walked around the city. If overall pollution standards are not met, businesses are shutdown.I hope mgt discusses this issue in detail at the quarterly earnings presentation. As I see it today, winter only issue, but it's an issue at both Chinese locations. Massive improvements have already been achieved, in general. I can only imagine that the new facility in Hebei was retrofitted for the proper emission controls, so this is not an ongoing problem at that location. But mgt needs to inform us.There is another facility in Ka Zuo, but I can't figure out where that is."
Stock is climbing even though volume is low......AXTI could move big on good news/earnings.
Stock is holding at $4.50.....even after I sold 30% of my holdings. I decided to sell my lot that was in the red to offset gains on a mutual fund I liquidated. I figured that we are in for some weakness also due to outbreak news in china.
I love AXTI's price action for past few weeks.Steady price climb on decent volume has continued even after huge run up after news.
Why is it crashing ? Cant find a thing
"Nice to see the revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $22.1 million, beating estimates.Great to see the pre-tax income now at $1.9 million for the quarter. These are stronger results than I was expecting. Balance sheet is also improved. Turning point is great to see. We will likely see AXTI over $8 per share this year."
Decent relative strength today. I guess attributable to the presentation yesterday. Anyone listen?
That was fun.....price up 21% and 5X average volume.
Northland Securities reiterated coverage of AXT with a rating of Outperform and set a new price target of $15.00 from $10.00 previously
"Earnings are OK, but nothing like the previous quarter's frenzy (which actually was a blow-out!). I think investors will be keeping on eye on AXTI to see how markets react before jumping in. AXTI's recent dilution effectively brings their 8C/share profit in line with expectations of 6C/share once it takes effect.At least there is not too much worry about ""sell-the-news"" action in that AXTI is already down 30% off highs from last earnings."
"Just doing my weekly (ok - sometimes not that frequently) reading of Semiconductor Today. IQE, a large customer of Axti, put out an business update. 2019 was a challenge and they are trending in line with their adjusted guidance for 2019, and well positioned to see them through this crises. They are in line with their previously issued guidance for this quarter. In particular, March is seeing strong run rates. Growth is now happening in wireless, 3D sensing and photonics. So, a slight positive in an otherwise bleak investing period."
"Earnings good. Upside surprise on Earnings and Revenue.....Q1 2020 consensus estimates as follows:Earnings loss of $0.05 shareRevenue $19.58 million. Down 3.1% from 1 year ago quarter.****Actcual Q1 2020 Earnings Release (4/22/2020) for AXTI is as follows:Earnings LOSS of $0.01/share.This is a pretty good upside surprise.Revenue $20.7 million...up 2.9% from 1 year ago quarter.Margins are also up.Note: 1.2 million ""other income"" is one time (???) award payment from local government for relocation."
make sure to listen to the Needham conference the link is on the AXTI website under investors at presentations.
"Anyone knows whether US govt's banning on selling equipment to ZTE has any impact on AXTI? Does AXTI sell anything to ZTE, and if any, what percent of AXTI's total revenue?"
AXT Inc. price target raised to $14 from $10 at BWS Finacial
"Listened to the Riley Conference investor call last night. Jotted down a few notes:Axti has a superior product than the competition in regards to INP and Germanium, due to VGF, so Axti's product has lower defect density. It's been proven. Either the competition has caught up to Axti or is very close in regards to Gaas.Axti believes they have 40% market share world wide in INP, which is growing nicely.Question was asked about Gallium Nitride taking over. Axti believes it is more of a complement than a product take over.The large contract announced last quarter is complete, finished order. It came from Hi-Shee, for 5G. Have no idea if the order will be repeated. Customers don't typically announce those types of things. 3D sensing - only developmental orders at this point. There are so many applications for 3D. The industry just isn't quite there yet. When it starts, it will be good, and will be long term.Rare earth retaliation from China - no supply concerns yet. These products, though somewhat rare as they aren't in abundance , aren't considered rare earth materials.Tariffs - Axti will defend market and eat the cost, until further notice. The cost, estimated at $375,000 now, per quarter, is not a game changer. It hurts, but not debilitating in any way. Competitors clearly have an advantage there.Wish they would have touched on one topic. Thoughts on how Huawi ban will affect Axti. That would have been nice to comment on. Also, no update on guidance overall. Would have liked to hear them say previous guidance is still current guidance. Boy is this tariff thing a cluster....."
"The recent PE investment suggests that the value of AXTI might be $17. I'm struggling to see that valuation, or maybe even the NASDAQ valuation. The InP market is interesting and should be a strong growth market. However, the analysts are expecting maybe a 17% growth rate and only 17 cents average consensus earnings for 2021. Thus, it has a 56 forward PE and a price to sales ration approaching 4. The lone market projection I found projects 14% InP substrate growth over the next 5 plus years. Is there more opportunity here than I'm appreciating? What am I missing? I understand there are potential new customers that are being qualified, so maybe there is an expectation there that is not reflected in analyst estimates???There must be something that supports the current valuation that I'm not seeing. I do not own a position and I'm not likely to acquire one in the next 30 days, but I am going to follow this stock because of its participation in the InP market."
