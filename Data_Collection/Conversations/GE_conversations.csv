The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn't depend on the government especially with the current economy crisis around the world
"SUMARY OF Q3 financials:I find the below statements to be true.1) The GE debt is shrinking fast and will be around $40 billion next week after GECAS2) The Free Cash Flow (if there had been no factoring offsets) in 2021 could easily have exceeded $7 billion.3) There was $4 billion offset in 2021 against Free Cash Flow that will not be there in 20224) There is $720 million factoring left to write off in Q4 of which $530 is GE CAPITAL and $190 is outside loans.5) The Free Cash Flow in 2022 will likely get to $9 billion, possibly higher.6) The stock price at 23 times earnings will most likely be at $200 a share.7) If the pandemic becomes much less important in 2022, the GE numbers will climb.8) If the Government spends on climate change and energy in their bill, GE will really benefit.9) There is a constant improving set of numbers each quarter at General Electric.10) There are enough good things happening in GE to offset any smaller division setbacks+ + +FINANCIALSA Look at the Q3 Numbers is rather straight forward.a) It consists of the profits from the 4 divisions AVIATION $846 million HEALTH $704 million RENEWABLES ($151) million loss POWER $204 million profit Total profit for Q3 was $1.603 million Free Cash Flow ProfitNow if GE did not want to zero FACTORING and had no INTEREST DEBT paynts, the Free Cash Flow for all 4 quarters at $1,6 billion per quarter would be $6.4 billion.Multiply times 23 time earnings to get a today stock price of $120 a share.but they did have factor and interest reductions almost finishedso their figures in Q3 are still not representative o how 2022 will look.b) FACTORING GE has reduced profit by subtracting factoring in Q3 by $362 million. The $362 million is subtracted from the $1.603 billion Free Cash Flow. making a subtotal left of $1.241 billion Free Cash Flow Then there was a GE CAPITAL loss of ($142) loss making the subtotal $1.099 billion profit Free Cash Flow minus Interest paid by GE INDUSTRIAL ($255 million) making the subtotal $844 million Free Cash Flow - 10-Q page 24 minus Interest paid GE CAPITAL ($259 million) - 10-Q page 24 making the subtotal $585 million Free Cash Flow - 10-Q page 24 So that $585 million adjusted Free Cash Flow gives a profit of $0.53 a share for Q3 There were a few add-ins to bring the number back to $0.57 a share.c) So lets look at General Electric from another viewpoint.... DEBT - 10-Q page 17, page 24 TOTAL borrowings $62,888 as follows: GE INDUSTRIAL has borrowings of $29,854 billion GE CAPITAL has borrowings of $33,034 billion When GE closes GECAS next week and pays the $21 billion against the GE CAPITAL debt - It will leave only $12.04 billion debt left in GE CAPITAL Since GE CAPITAL has $7 billion cash, they really only should then owe $5 billion left.d) Now look at the debt at GE INDUSTRIAL 1-5 year bonds $3.29 billion 5-10 year bonds $6.26 billion 10+ years bonds $21.24 billion summary - GE TOTAL notes are $30.79 billion but this is also not too bad becuse they all have low interest and long term paybacksCONCLUSIONLarry Culp has taken the medicine and we are all living with the past mistakes. But it is obvious that he is sharing the profit with also eradicating the past mistakes.If we wait through Q4 and lf the company just perform as it has in the past, 2022 will be the year when any stockholder of General Electric will be richly rewarded.Noting I have seen in the Q3 financials is concerning. In fact, there is vast IMPROVEMENT IN EVERY CATEGORY.The real question is: Do you have the patience and belief to stay the course?I do....Gene"

"When $1,600,000,000 slips under the radar: (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Air Force awarded General Electric Co. a potential $1.58 billion deal to provide as many as 329 engines for the service’s newest jet fighter, the F-15EX, if all seven options are exercised, beating the rival Pratt & Whitney unit of Raytheon Technologies Corp. in a competition, the Pentagon said Friday.GE was awarded an initial firm, fixed-price job to provide and install 29 engines for the F-15EX fleet for $136 million, the first traunch in a project that could run through 2031. The Air Force said in January 2020 that it planned to buy the engines sole-source from GE. Pratt & Whitney, which provided engines for previous F-15 models, protested the plan. That forced the service to open the program to the competition that GE now has won."
"Just coming over the Bloomberg terminal - part 2 Bloomberg just now being put on the web - part 2“We really are in a position where we’re going to be able to play more offense,” Culp said. Culp stressed that “playing offense” first means growing GE’s existing businesses that make jet engines, power equipment and imaging machines for hospitalsAnd debt reduction remains GE’s top priority for allocating its cash. To wit, GE will to use proceeds from the AerCap deal to step up debt reduction since 2018 from roughly $49 billion today to $75 billion.Yet Culp’s history at Danaher Corp., where he revamped the company with $28 billion worth of deals, suggests he’s unlikely to stop there. He dazzled Wall Street with outsized returns and a steady cadence of deals to reshape the business from a dowdy maker of industrial products and Sears Craftsman tools to a health-care and life-science equipment and services provider. He did it with a dispassionate view of the company’s holdings, telling an investor conference in 2010 that “no Danaher business has a permanent place in the portfolio.”Culp has applied a similar philosophy at GE. In one of his first moves as CEO, he cut GE’s prized dividend to a token penny a share. Two years ago, he agreed to sell off GE’s bio-pharmaceutical business to his former employer for $21.4 billion, shelving an earlier plan to spin off the broader health-care division. And in March, GE announced Culp’s largest deal to date: combining GE Capital Aviation Services with AerCap, parting with what’s been the jewel in GE Capital’s otherwise tarnished crown.GE will erase GE Capital from its financial reports after that deal closes, and fold what’s left into its corporate balance sheet. Among the remnants is the insurance unit carrying $37.7 billion in liabilities as of the end of September. The business primarily backs long-term care policies that cover costs such as nursing home care and other cost associated with aging, which have been a big drain as Americans live longer and health care costs continue to rise. The insurance portfolio has cast a long shadow over GE. It prompted a $6.2 billion charge in 2018, plus another $15 billion over several years to cover a shortfall in reserves after years of deterioration with little warning to investors. It also drew the attention of U.S. securities regulators in a probe of accounting issues at the company, which GE agreed to pay $200 million to settle last year.Jettisoning the insurance unit would be a “momentous” step toward eliminating risks that have spooked some investors for years, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.“It would’ve been euphoric a couple of years ago but it just wasn’t going to happen back then,” he said. “It would remove another one of these nagging overhangs on the stock, if it were to be eliminated at a reasonable price.” It would also achieve what Culp’s two most recent predecessors couldn’t: all but eliminating what remains of GE Capital, a big source of the company’s financial woes over the past decade.Dray said GE could use some of the $24 billion in cash from the AerCap deal to attract a buyer for the insurance unit. “If some new cash is coming in the door, what’s the best use of those proceeds? At a minimum, it should be part of the dialogue,” he said.Still, the once-volatile insurance operation has stabilized. It passed annual stress tests in each of the last two years and generated a tidy profit of $360 million in the first nine months of 2021.That steadier performance, plus looming interest-rate hikes that may lift returns on the portfolio’s assets, could help GE secure a deal to part with the unit for good -- even if it has to pay someone to do it, said William Blair analyst Nick Heymann. He said the likelihood of a divestiture will grow once the aircraft lessor sale closes.“This is a boat that can float and everybody thinks it’s a concrete boat with no bottom,” he said in an interview.Culp has long signaled his openness to a deal to unload the business, but he tempered expectations that will materialize soon. “We don’t need to be in the long-term care business any longer,” Culp said. “It’s a more attractive asset than it was, but in terms of the potential timing for a transaction, I can’t say, so I won’t.”posted by genepart 2"
"Clearly, GE is a better run company under Culp. It has been 3 years since he took over. This kind of turnaround took time. GE's story will continue to get better. Guidance is very positive. This is just the sunrise."
It appears that the prospects of investing in General Electric seem to be on the rise. It would be a good time to create a position and watch the magic unfold. Thank you Mr Culp for leading the troops back onto the field and out of the bunkers. Carry on.
"ChrisYou said you were surprised the stock price of GE has not moved up.Like you, I am also surprised the stock price is not higher But I think the average investor and also the poorly trained analysts covering GE cannot understand that the General Electric statements are underplaying their strengths.I doubt anyone reads the actual financials (with a few exceptions)Not that Culp is hiding anything.Culp and Dybeck Happe are handcuffed.They are simply following the accounting standards which require them deducting the removal of factoring as part of Free Cash Flow from operating Expenses (FCFOE).That will be about $4 billion lost in FCF in 2022 paying back factoring.That also will never appear again in 2023.So far few in the investing world just do not see it as clearly as I do.The good news is that at some point the reality will catch up with the image and that is when the stock will head up.That is the patience I have been posting.It is not the company who is giving unclear signs. They have been telling us all is well.it is the investment community that is slow to understand the real numbers.If Culp announces real news like a merger, or some government contract for energy under new bill, or perhaps something dramatic - then the stock will finally jump.Gene"
"History: In June 2015 the Microsoft share price was $44.15. Microsoft closed yesterday at $310.11, a growth in 6 years of 600%. Does GE have the same potential given the current business mix? Maybe."
GE will soon have its balance sheet permanently in order. GE currently has 25 billion in cash plus 24 billion for the AerCap deal on November 1st plus 5 billion in Baker shares. That comes out to 54 billion in cash! GE currently has a 63 billion debt. On the road to being debt free! Culp has done an amazing job. We will see more dividends and buybacks before long.
Looking forward to the upgrades and revised price targets
"DanThank you for your support.I share your just waiting for tomorrow's results takes patience....butEither you believe Culp has done all he said he has done - or we all have been ""gamed"".Now Culp has NEVER misreported in all his career, so I know his new contracts actually happened.And it is implausible that Culp would sell at less than a profit unless he was buying market share.Buying market share is a common management way of knocking out competition.In GE's case, I suspect this happened on OFFSHORE Dogger Bank. Culp spent $1 billion perfecting the Halaide 12GW since 2018 and building the first working model in Rotterdam which started last year. He is up to Halaide 14GW in 18 months.That wind turbine development was a perfect example of buying market share and spending precious capital that he was investing for future results.We will not know for a while what his game plan was....PROFITSThe only question left is when the actual profits show up on the bottom line.For example, he just sold $30 billion in the GECAS sale. That closes in 7 days. This new cash will show up in the Q4 results.Does that mean that his $70 billon long term debt will drop to $40 billion.Is $40 billion with most in 10 year bonds now unimportant?Nobody except GE management knows....It is a management decision on what to spend on , but the GECAS deal will have a longer term effect on the future General Electric - if matters little when the $30 billion shows up.I say that because I am not sure that Q3 will finally show off the real General Electric..When you look sat the truly great companies in the past, you can see this pattern.Apple was down early on years ago.Now it is a legendary stock even my wife owns (very, very conservative lady).A better example is Tesla. Two years ago Musk was at $300 a share and threatening to go private.Tesla is now at $900. Would selling Tesla have been a smart move in 2019? Who knows.CONCLUSIONS1) General Electric is poised for dramatic results, but perhaps not as much in Q3 - 2021.2) I am firmly believing that the INSANE DAILY early trading is being done y novice investors from places like Read-it boards and programed day traders commanding large trader money.3) Profession fund managers are still in on owning GE4) NO ANALYST OR NEWSLETTER WRITER has a clue about the real General Electric.It is all guesswork and very poorly done.5) The future direction of the world favors General Electric - think climate change6) General Electric dominates 2/3rds of all jet engines on this planet.Same with Healthcare and MRI, Sonic, Ultrasound, and life monitor systems where GE touches 1 of every two people on this planet.Isn't that an ""essential industry?"" So do not focus to hard on Q3. It may become a ""win"" situation, but in no waycan GE stock ownership become a ""lose"" situation.Gene"

"The GECAS deal ExplainedI kept puzzling on why AerCap would pay GE $21 billion cash to buy GECAS1) perhaps GECAN is a rich, profitable division of GE2) perhaps Aercap simply wants it to double their business and get GE to feed them new business3) or perhaps the GECAS leasing debt is at last $21 billion at GE and AERCAP is simply assuming itMY TAKE ISThe $2I billion cash to GECAS on closing is simply to buy the paper being held by GE CAPITAL - much like your bank mortgage transferring on your house.I think GECAS is simply assuming/buying the GECAS outstanding leases.That is similar to your bank selling off your mortgage to a reinsurer.If this is true, we have been understating the GE assets because they have contract for plane engines offsetting debt. Their 10-Q does not say this and they have never disclosed this - but it is the only sensible thing to explain the $21 billion payment for the GECAS-AERCAP sale.My belief following Culp and Dycap Happe's words on Tuesday is they plan to pay off the $21 billion leases in the GE CAPITAL accountand turn the paperwork over the AerCap, much like selling a car and signing off the title.I think the payment is to be made immediate just like selling an asset and signing off on the paperwork (think car title).gene"
"This just came across on BloombergCulp Plots GE's Next Act as Deal Closing Unlocks PossibilitiesRyan Beene, Bloomberg News Friday 10/29 10am(Bloomberg) -- General Electric Co. CEO Larry Culp is about to close his biggest deal yet- AerCap buying GECAS. And to hear him tell it, he’s just getting started. The company’s $30 billion sale of its aircraft-leasing business to Ireland’s AerCap Holdings NV closes on Monday, fueling another wave of debt payoffs that Culp has made a hallmark of his three years as chief executive officer. That will enable GE to once again consider moves that have been all but unthinkable so far on Culp’s watch: It will allow boosting GE’s minuscule dividend, buying back shares, making acquisitions, or shedding a once-toxic book of nearly $40 billion in insurance liabilities.“We are positioning the board to have the opportunity to spend more time on capital allocation decisions,” Culp said“Whether it be a dividend, whether it be buybacks, or whether it be M&A, those are not topics this board has necessarily had the luxury of spending a lot of time on over the last several years.”Culp declined to say which of those actions GE might consider first. Any of them would mark a shift beyond the priorities that have thus far dominated his efforts to pull GE from an epic stock collapse that wiped out $200 billion in market value. posted by gene (more to come on another post or two)"
