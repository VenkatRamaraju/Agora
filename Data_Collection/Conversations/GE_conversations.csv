"SeanIf you do not think a 50% return on capital (cap rate) is enough for you in a year - you are a lousy investor.You are being offered that sort of return with a buy into General Electric and that is a very strong return on investment in the next 18 months.If you take all your $1.7 million and buy GE you could end up with $3.4 million.So this is a ""guts decision"" you and ONLY you can make and it is totally a private decision.I have made that sort of call.Can you?It is called ""putting your money where your mouth is"".Gene"
"SeanYou say that you started your portfolio 10 years ago with 99k and have made 17x in 10 years. Approximately 20 years ago, like you, I thought I was a hot shot investor when Mr. Market relieved me of 400k. It taught me to do my research and I have done extremely well since. Had you been through 1987, 2001 and 2008, you would realize that detailed research and diversification is critical. I do not think that GE will do for me what my NVDA has, but I do think it has become a very good investment. In past post, I have been very clear about my first purchases of GE and my most recent purchases in another portfolio. My point is, most of us are not here to brag or call names. We are here to discuss the news and merits of GE.Think about it. You get what you give.Just an old man's opinion."
"I would like to know what the offer for nuclear is. If GE closes the deal on Gecas and pays down debt with both sales, it could be a huge game changer."
"SeanIf you had the guts, the smarts, and did you research like I did last July you would have taken a position in General Electric at $5.98 like I did with 6 figures buy in - and now I am close to that 7 figure position.It is all about timing and today there is still a possible doubling but half the rise is behind me.Gene"
"Alright you GE fan boys, suppose I'm an investor with a 7-figure value brokerage account kind of money. Persuade me on why I should invest in your GE stock.When I look at the % returns numbers the only part I see that is half way decent is the 1-year return. The rest of the long-term numbers are abysmal: The 3-year return of GE is 7.48%. The 5-year return of GE is -44.07% The 10-year return is -33.69%A good investor takes into account not just the short-term performance of a stock but its long-term performance as well, and from the looks of it GE is a losing proposition as an investment. Now persuade me otherwise..."
What’s with the no news? I’ve never been so sure they are positioned perfectly going forward…
French EDF set to buy GE's nuclear turbines business - La Tribune
"66% held by institutional investors, now they will begin allowing the price to increase. Or they will wait for 80% or higher. In the past three decades, I’ve noticed THEY manipulate stock prices, to hold them down during accumulation. Then after 60% institutional ownership is achieved, they begin to allow price to rise. Imagine we are playing a rigged game, watch the behavior of the elephants in the room. Maybe we will see north of $200 by January!!!GE is a much better company than it was before…"
Barron’s says that GE is due for a strong run higher. I figured that might be the case.
" y’all worry too much, instead of making money, I'm no expert in trading but I have made what i could never imagine, investment worth it with Mr Andrew Tubbs and his team, I've nothing but continued success... you can contact him Tele*gram @tradelikeandrew instead of complaining buy bitcoin and invest now is the time"
"If it takes a 40 amp circuit to charge your new car and you can't run your household AC during the summer heat waves, it would be common sense to think GE power will have a great future. Just an old man's opinion."
"Hopefully soon we will hear from Tusa again, that should drive GE to new highs. Newer trend. Tusa speak = GE goes higher"
"It's funny how hard some people try to keep GE down. Zach's latest headline: GE down .3%, can it rebound?....Seriously. .3%? Hold the press! SMH"
GE and Four More Industrial Stocks Due For a Bounce -- For Good Reason barrons
"GE awarded a 2-Year, $2 million project through the U.S. Dept. of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon mgmt. The system will combine novel 3D-printed heat exchanger tech w/innovative sorbent materials to effectively extract CO2 from the atmosphere. This could pave the way for future large-scale economically viable CO2 capture in power generation. GE researches are partnering with top chemists and engineers from UC Berkeley and the University of South Alabama. This same team is employing a similar innovative approach to extract water from air so we can give potable clean water for troops in the field.GE is clearly involved in cutting edge technologies with public and private support. GE is definitely not an industrial dinosaur. Recently, I read that GE is popular w/millenials and Gen Z, and I believe they recognize the long term potential of this company's energy & power operations.GE should be one of the main beneficiaries of the infrastructure bill. IMHO it is not priced in the SP yet."
"see below Investopedia comment on GE :""The 14 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for General Electric Co have a median target of 128.00, with a high estimate of 168.00 and a low estimate of 80.00. The median estimate represents a +20.65% increase from the last price of 106.09.""that's music to my earsgo GE"

"Fantastic, holding the gains. we are in a good company. plan to hold until January 2025 and accumulate dividend in shares."
