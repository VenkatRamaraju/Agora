"Yesterday's rally:IMO, most of the shorters are ex-employees and they probably got a whiff of something that spooked them to cover. Of course the day traders jumped on the bandwagon and we ended up in the 10M volume and 30% jump in price. Due to the fact that they terminated the Shareholder Rights Agreement earlier than its expiration in April, gives hint of a possible acquisition. Those who jumped, must think of getting back at some point since the rally is probably going to continue until the actual news comes out. Then it will be too late, as two more 30% rallies will put us in $5 range. JMHO."
"CHS stores have opened to full capacity and are likely to falter even more.Why do I say that?WMT experienced 3% sales growth last year.HD experienced 32% YOY sales growth.We are in the new normal. People's shopping habits have changed. Everyone is free to shop where they want or on-line. The apparel sector has recovered 90%, but not CHS. Something is wrong and share prices are likely to erode further."
Chico's debt to equity ratio currently stands at an astounding 1.98 according to Macrotrends and 2.5 according to Gurufocus.Long term debt has steadily increased while equity has shrunk by 70%. Both are trending in opposite directions. CHS is approaching negative equity!D/E ratio is one of the highest in the business as Chico's will soon be in creditor's hands.To put things into perspective JCP D/E is 3.This trend will not reverse and cannot be rectified. This trend will decide the fate of CHS. I think you know what will happen.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHS/chicos-fas/debt-equity-ratio
6 insider sell orders in the past 2 days selling back to the company.They are loving it.23 insider sells in the past year.Their bonuses keep paying them royally.
Will eventually work it's way back over $5 once the market is done with there games
Great dividend yield. Chicos and ASNA are both in the doghouse on wall st big time these days.Wall St acting as if they both are going bankrupt. Not so sure this is happening. IMHO over reaction. Chicos closing underperforming stores and ASNA trying to shed divisions. They are not on life support. IMHO both great spec plays for nice rebounds.
why are people selling going into dividends?
"Guggenheim Capital LLC Sells 25,683 Shares of Chico’s FAS, Inc. (NYSE:CHS).Don't let the institutional selling get in your way."
Chicos paid a quarterly dividend from 2010 to 2020. One would expect they will pay dividends again starting sometime in mid to late 2021.
Hold on to your shares!!!... it will rebound................
Hedge fund putting pressure on Chico's. I'm up 42% and still holding. I think we see at least 9 bucks like it was trading years ago. It reached higher than that but I am trying to be reasonable. It's the old lady shopping favorite which includes me.
"Based on a sales-to-price of 1.0 (which is only about average) this stocks price should be about $11.66 right now.Management has projected a sales increase Y-O-Y of 35%. Therefore even $11 is considered low.As soon as they start reporting any profits this stock will be making multi-year highs.IMO this stock is severely underpriced and will be a big winner in the not so distant future.Also, there will be analysts upgrading this stock after this quarter is reported."
2009 low yet it's 2018. LARGEST single day selloff EVER in CHS today. D. Ellis gone. What did they pay this absolute failure? I hope it wasn't in dollars.
Superb results. $8 pps is in the corner.
Do not be surprised if CHS is bought. It presently has about $3 /share in losses for the last year was well as $2 /share book. The losses would shelter the buyer's income from taxes.
"Mr. J, granted the situation at present is not good but fortunes can be made investing in companies that pull it through. When investing you make money in company not because how great they are at present but what is the direction, is it getting better or worse, second question is can they go through the rough times and survive. Every damn retailer signs lease and according to you then they are all loaded with debt and should be avoided. Focus on expense, focus more so on revenue, focus on management and if they have a solid plan to grow into profitability. The stock price has discounted a lot of bad and improvement in operation will reward investors handsomely. Quarter over quarter revenues did well despite having same number of days having shut down, the expenses went down, online sales grow well, management was energetic and came across as knowing how to turn this around. I think a 21% rise in stock price bears witness to that."
"A lot of positives to consider about this company and stock, but the continued struggling share price is disappointing especially considering the outstanding performance of other apparel retailers. Still, though, I think when the tide turns, it's going to turn hard."
Once the shorts realize it has bottomed out they will start to cover but retail has already bought the shares so up up and away it goes !!!!
They have lots of cash. I don’t know what you’re talking about. They turned down a buyout for 3 bucks a share last year. Shorts will be covering soon. They are also in possession of some much desired property in ft Myers the can sell. No worries here. Just waiting for it to take off again
Any bets on what they say tomorrow?
"From MarketBeat: 4 brokerages have issued 1 year target prices for Chico's FAS's shares. Their forecasts range from $2.00 to $5.00. On average, they anticipate Chico's FAS's share price to reach $3.45 in the next twelve months. This suggests a possible upside of 260.7% from the stock's current price."
An institution just sold 1.12 million shares.I think they read the 8K report as well to see the real numbers.
"Jefferies Financial Group also issued estimates for Chico’s FAS’s anticipates that the specialty retailer will post earnings of ($0.19) per share for Q3, Q4 earnings at ($0.08) EPS, FY2021 earnings at ($0.98) EPS, FY2022 earnings at ($0.47) EPS and FY2023 earnings at ($0.15) EPS.Chico's has LT support at $1 per share. That is the next logical place to visit"
CHS should be $5.50 by Monday 5/24/21.
same old same old excuses excuses
CHS debt is 4x market cap. You can see CHS will likely fall much further
"We may touch a new 52wk high everyday for the next few days, as the momentum picks up. CHS is finally being recognized as valuable stock with potential for reinstating dividends in the near future."
Per Bezinga:A resurgence of the apparel retail sector could send Chico's stock soaring well above its current $3.50 share price
told you $7 was a high price.. fully pricing in recovery
here we go. it will trend back up towards dividend excise date
Looks like they are just spooking the weak hands.
This stock is worth somewhere between 3.50 and 4.30 which are the price of the rejected buyout. If management wanted the money why not sell at 4.30.
"Institutional selling being reported reflects activity in the last quarter ( Q2). This includes March and April when many had to reduce position as a hedge or had to due to falling prices that hit sell limits. Or their investment policy dictated mandatory sales for certain events.The target market that CHS sells to is a higher income group. This market does not just disappear. The survivors who sell in this retail market will have a bigger slice of market share once we return to normal. Management 101 says in bad times, take advantage of it by downsizing and eliminate unnecessary cost, close now nonprofitable operations and take write down so that earnings in future operations will more profitable."
"Motley Fool article says the reason stock fell is because sales at WHBM and Chicos PLUMMETED 5% and 14% respectively. Huh? Compared to what? Obviously the sales were up over 40% each compared to a year ago, so I have no idea to what the author of this article is referring."
Just the facts mam. DJIA doubled in the last 5 years. CHS DOWN 68% in the last 5 years.
where is Jeremy and his magical PUTS...?
"I doubt it buddy. The stock price does not suggest it. Something is up. Besides, majority shares are held by institutions and they know what they are getting into. Things are getting back to normal and that means CHS back to 3-4."
"How can one compare BBBY to CHS. BBBY sells thousands of items from soap dish to garbage cans, from towels to bedsheets and depends on a lot of suppliers. CHS is only women clothing and undies."
"Hey J.Remember when you said that apparel retail is doing better than 2019? here is a quote from...what do ya know, yahoo news...the exact same forum we are on.""Sales at clothing and accessories stores went from $22.5 billion in January 2020 to a low of $3 billion in April as the pandemic spread and lockdowns ensued, according to data from the Census Bureau. At $20 billion in January of this year, sales at clothing and accessories stores have gained for two straight months. That's still shy of the nearly $23 billion spent at clothing and accessories stores in May 2018, which represents the high water mark of the past 32 months, per Census Bureau data."" I put the link below, from Friday's article.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/are-people-about-to-buy-a-ton-of-new-clothes-post-pandemic-175615654.html?.tsrc=fin-notifYou seem smart, so lets start talking about how to make money...on a stock trading forum!"
CHS is priced like shopping will stop 100%. Online orders will increase if people stop going in malls. Plus 12% dividend. Stock is very underpriced.
"The executives at Chico's need to gain insights into their store mangers ability to sell properly and train the people the district managers approve for hire. Each of the district and store managers need to be given a color coordination test. If they don't know how to or can't coordinate colors they are working at a disadvantage in trying to make product additions off the sale of one item. Don't assume that just because a women has been hired for management that they know how to coordinate, mix and match colors. Listening, over hearing a conversation from five women seems to indicate a lack of selling coordinated fashion on the part of your employees in the store. Maybe you need to have training classes within your organization to train how to sell fashion in coordinating colors for your managers at every level. Hiring off the street just to have a body coverage in a store without the saleswoman understanding how to incrementally increase sales through product additions will be nothing more then an order taker."
We are committed to taking all appropriate actions to improve performance and drive shareholder value.
shorts are scared so they are making up stories now!!
Brooks says Chico's has experienced double-digit digital growth over the past six weeks.
Goldman Sachs sells 2 million shares of CHS.Bank of NY Mellon sells 1.3 million shares.Prior to earnings release.
Finally CHS has a highly qualified CFO.
Looks like heading to New lows.
"Small retail stocks trade purely on emotion and not fundamentals, look at $CHS today 120% payout ratio, revenue down 10% year to year, up 7% today."
CHS has nowhere to go but down so quit with the $3 dream. Economy will not recover soon. Maybe a slightly better short term but CHS is not part of any incline just by permanant residule decline. CHS is going to under .70 for sure. Look at the data not pipe dream. The market is overvalued and CHS can never reclaim 4 or 5 months no revenue.
"Is there ANY chance of Chicos getting back to the thriving and growing profitable company it once was, or is all retail falling off the same cliff and Chicos doomed too? Seems like Chicos is scrambling to find a way to make money, opening stores on cruise ships. in airports, selling on Amazon, and home shopping network. They're still barely profitable (so far) and we have been getting a decent dividend since we've lost $10/share, but is this as good as it gets? I don't see any improvements and all I hear is after the fact excuses like ""we had the wrong styles"". Their last earnings miss of 3 cent drove share price down $2.50 and our once 3 billion cap company is now only 3/4 B. Another miss and results like last quarter and this company could be worth more dead then alive, book value is $5.19. Changes need to be made, QUICK!"
Starting to get to levels where shorts will have to buy back. Will there be a few days of multi dollar moves?
Go reread the March earnings call. Over $200 million per year in permanent operational savings. Lease reductions. Growing online presence. This stock could easily go over $10 this year.
Rising 100 sma is about to cross upwards over the declining but flattening 1000 sma. First time in a decade.
"I decided to buy this stock due to the packed store here in Fl every time I went in this winter, They say when it comes to retail check out the traffic, Chico’s is probably the most popular store in this area,"
Finally she’s fired under her rule the stock dropped 50 percent looking to a real merchant not a bean counter to turn around these stores have fab clothes
reddit might squeeze this one next...
"I had held for so long; recently sold half my position. I'm confident my loss will be made up with my new holdings, (not pumping anything, just sharing), however I really like Chicos, so I'll continue to hold the rest. merchandise alone warrants the share price moving up. glad to see this coming back!! :)"
Lot of downgrades this morning.Seem to forecast $4.50 to $5 area.We will see
"If the executives at FAS had not given themselves full pay and all those bonuses, they could have given each store another $30,000 in income, but they gave all the money to themselves. Hopefully, no employees are reading the annual report of all the scandals."
"While the apparel sector has recovered 90% from from pre-covid highs, CHS has recovered 55%. Something is amiss internally. Debt is accumulating faster than normal while the executives get paid. CHS is doing everything wrong to sustain their business at investor expense. Let's wait for the 10Q numbers to a snapshot of the numbers."
betting my lifetime savings on CHS. Wife doesn't know.
"There are over 2850 job openings at Chico's. 2850!They only have 4500 employees, let's exclude Canada. They're gone.144 pages of positions at 20 positions per page.This stock is in huge trouble as everyone is abandoning ship.8-26 will be pivotal. We'll see who sells before and after.There is no way to spin this as good news getting to go out of business.https://jobs.chicos.com/jobs/retail/?page_jobs=1"
"Copied from below, where someone asked to compare the Broader era with the Dyer era. @mike, Way worse. Stock price was around $4 when Dyer took over. Got to almost $19. Broader took over it was around $16. She spent countless time and millions of dollars fighting off a takeover bid around $19. Since then, it's been single digits. She moved some people, which was necessary, yet, in every case, the replacement she hired was worse than the person she fired. She has no one in senior positions who is a true merchant. She doesn't understand the importance of driving sales. She, and none of her top execs, know how to drive sales. She's a bean counter by nature. She thinks every problem can be solved by cutting expenses. She's addicted to consultants, who tell her where to cut. When they fire her, soon I hope, if she's replaced with someone who knows how to attack the top line, the company will be fine. If they keep her, this company is toast. My expectation is that she stays through Q4 and is gone in the Spring. (To pursue ""other opportunities."") I've heard they already have feelers out in the marketplace."
Fake price drop. We may cross the 52 week high before the next earnings report.
RSI down to 33.17 so about as oversold as it gets for a company that is turning around and now profitable and beating on revenue as well as earnings per share. I am buying more here at the bottom.
CHS looks like it's ready to retest the 52 week high and may have enough momentum to breakout.
"Mr. J, one more thing, preferred shares are not debt, preferred share holders can not send the company to bankruptcy, preferred is an equity stake, if company doe not make money can stop paying preferred dividends, it all depends in type of preferred some have a clause that dividends would be accumulative , meaning before company pays any dividend in common share she has to pay the dividends it owes to preferred first, but not many are accumulative Another world my friend, move all those figures you have on preferred shares from your debt column to equity and your ratios will turn upside down and slap you in the face."
Store within a store means no spin-off of Soma and warning on supply chain also killing stock.
"Tutorial time (for anyone interested)I will be addressing what I think you should be aware of and my opinion about recently released quarterly results, in particular managements guidance.I will attach more comments as time allows.As of today, 09/02/21, Chico's has 20 ""jackets"" available on the website. Fall begins on 09/22. So lightweight coats will dominate. Keep on eye on available ""jackets"" as we get into early November if heavier coats don't start to show up that may be a problem.Sounds simple right. Keep in mind many parts of the country experience cold weather sooner than others. This has always been a problem for apparel retailers; how to allocate what items to which boutique (store). This is why the website becomes more crucial.IMO the companies guidance is not as bad as it was perceived. I want to reread the conference call transcript again before making any further comments.More to come."
"Just remember back in November 2008 CHS fell to a low of $1.72, and was $14 one year later."
"If I have this right, Sycamore, which owns 6-7% of CHS, offered $4.30 a share and got rejected. They return a few weeks later and offer $3.50...this tells me they are signaling “give us a reasonable price to begin negotiations”...Meanwhile, the CEO picks up a 170,000 shares free of charge on May 1st...so IMO something is moving forward...time will tell..."
I bought at 5.00. Seems a bit oversold based on the excellent earnings report.
"Contrary to J's continued misleading postings, CHS announces 11/2/20 that debt at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 totaled $149 million. Further they don't expect to need to draw any monies at all from their credit line this year or next year.You think CHS is going bk, go right ahead and short it to your financial loss."
Glad I am shorting huge shares at $1.55. Share price is definitely going to below .67 this year. Awesome.
"There is a thin veil of support holding CHS up. Look at the weekly chart. There are series of bear flags and pennants all over that chart. Another is forming now. Once it breaks, CHS will smash lower. EIther Sidibid and moho are correct that sales quotas are being met or the chart is forecasting a major leg down is coming up. I am betting on the chart. I see no recovery and BK looms. Check the weekly chart for yourself. That is as bearish as can be."
"The conference call with Bonnie Brooks and Todd (CFO) was very upbeat. Suggest every shareholder listen to it on CHS site. Obviously yesterday's 18% drop was more manipulation by shorts and greedy market makers, just look at today's tape!"
"Well boys and girls, Chicos has closed down their corporate offices in Ft Myers which comes along with the shelter in place state guidelines.Of course, they never announced any compensation reductions at any level!Should have sold Company for the $4.50!!!!!"
Went to a WHBM. Salesperson said sales are increasing and they are meeting sales goals.
"Larry... you first Piped Up negatively on the CHS board 18 weeks ago.. what the stock traded at $1... now it will open around $2.50....tell me what good or value you have added.... looking back, do you wish anyone would have taken your advice along the way..?"
"I am in The Villages in Florida and throughout the winter was in and out of Chico’s frequently, always seeing a wait line to check out and wait to use a dressing room. I think it probably is the most popular store in our location. I can’t understand the stock price not improving. Even Thrift and Consignment shops here have special “Chico’s” sections."
"CHS price target has been lowered to 78 cents.Yes, they only have mounting debt. They borrowed money to have cash.Now they have - $138M in levered cash flow on top of $638M in debt.They took out a loan to have cash in the form of debt.Their LT debt from their quarterly report shows total noncurrent (LT) debt is $637.96 million.Everyone is trying to fake the numbers.Their debt is mounting each quarter and their assets are dropping.Again, the D/E numbers will tell you that they are already severely underwater and unless they have a great quarter they will not make it for too much longer. You can verify all of this information yourself.It is now a question of when will they reach 78 cents."
this $2 stock is perfect for the next run up.... it's fundamentals are improved and also very lowly priced.JILL is another at $4 with only a few hundred share float. doesn't take much to move it to over $10.
If JWN can't hold CHS has little chance of a beat.
This is like playing with FIRE ! ! ! Know when to FOLD EM. Stock is performing now like SEARS.. Plus local chico's store in my town is next to closed up Sears in the mall.. Scary ending ahead...........
"Levered free cash flow is -$139 million ttm.This is a disastrous sign.If this number continues to grow along with D/E ratio, it will become impossible to pump the stock up any more. Will need to wait until November to dig deeper into the numbers. 90-96 cents is the new target.More selling pressure to come."
"Today, CHS issued an early termination to the Shareholder Rights Agreement, which was due to expire on 04/02/2021. This hints to me they have a buyer lined up. Discuss."
"The Canada thing scared some people which I thing is unwarranted. They had 11 stores in Canada which smartly had organized it as separate entity and they close them as part of cost reduction and did it by taking advantage of bankruptcy laws, not material effect to the company. I think sales are going to surprise to the upside, why? insider buying, pent up demand, other retailers reporting good revenue and profit. I think finances are fine, most of debt is the lease obligation for many years to come, they have quite a bit of cash on hand."
"Interim President and CEO of Chico's Fas Inc (NYSE:CHS) Bonnie R. Brooks bought 28,700 shares of CHS on 06/14/2019 at an average price of $3.49 a share"
"It seems unconscionable that this Board of Directors has stood idly by and allowed this company to be destroyed over the last 3 years. The overall market is up about 50% in that time and CHS is down about 60%. The Broader experiment has failed, miserably. It's not going to get better, because she has no idea how to make it better. Her forte is self promotion. She's not a merchant, and she has no concept how to improve a company that relies on astute merchandising. She's not a leader. And she has started to turn on the people she has hired. Her ""people"" are far worse at their jobs than the people they replaced. (Kind of ironic since Broader is far worse at her job than Dave D. ever was.) She needs to go. Soon. Now. And they need to replace her with someone who knows how to run a retail organization. If the Board does not act, then all Board member standing for election this year also need to go. It's as simple as that."
Over 80 cents per share yearly earnings equates to at least a $16 stock. Yet down to $5.25 pre market. Go figure.
"Bonnie Brooks purchased 77,176 shares at $1.2957 on 6/26/2020 according to Form 4 filings bringing her total ownership to 1,017,530 shares of CHS."
This CHS short will continue bring me in big cash!
People are going to be getting $1200 checks within 2 weeks. Shoppers will splurge at Chicos/WHBM/Soma for new clothes. A lot will go into stock accounts and they will be looking for short squeeze potentials like CHS. I would not be short this stock..... and it could very well hit $10 by summer.
WHAT TOTAL FRAUD BY THE SHORT SELLERS. How many illegal shares being shorted today? This earnings report was blockbuster. I am so sick of the rampant manipulation tho.
Blackrock has purchased 18 million shares of Chico's. The bulk of it was bought near $14/sh in March of 2017. They now are carrying a 90%+ loss. Look for additional selling pressure for the balance of the year. The trend has been strong institutional selling. I would expect that to become much greater.
"Are you all dreaming after a disastrous quarter? Earnings -68 cents, sales down 27%, debt at record highs. I'll give you the real numbers when available. All this after all of the stores are open. Things cannot be worse than they are. CHS is in huge trouble."
"Short term traders will be taking profits today. That is a HUGE mistake! CHS is worth a minimum of $12 if not more. Let Goldman Sachs do their thing and you will see the price rise above $10 in the next few quarters. BOD's needs to step up the buyback and that is what Goldman will probably tell them today. Be patient, don't sell for a few months if you have to sell."
sitting on 5400 shares.. most bought in the $1s.. what to do? don't want to get too greedy
count the times Larry posts here in a day..
"Covered my short today at $4.95. Expect a small dead cat bounce to fill the gap. Then short again. Ultimately, this is a $3 or less stock. Just a matter of time."
"@Sidibid1, recently you posted that CHS had a $50m+ tax receivable (I think you deleted said posting since I was unable to find it)... that was to be received ""this summer"". Please explain from where this was derived, was it to be paid by US govt, or by whom? Further the current balance sheet has a tax receivable of $57,513, and NO OTHER RECEIVABLES...very strange for a retail chain like CHS, to have only a tax receivable. No credit cards, no individual accounts, or whatever is reported. If you contend the tax receivable is from the US govt, please know that CHS has not reported any Federal income tax payments, for some length of time, especially in the $50m range . Appreciate your input."
"J. Serious question, do you actually own any CHS stock? Next question, you think that her comp is excessive for a person running as large of an enterprise. Another question. How much do you think their front line sales associates should be paid? I did read your well thought out response to the earlier response I gave you, and there were some very cogent points made. I just can not figure out where you are coming from on here? Are we discussing a stock trade?"
This stock will not make it. Sales are down 46%. Debt is at $860 million. $194 million earnings loss. Do not listen to Sidibid.
Bought and sold VHS but would be hesitant to buy even after today's drop. They need to eliminate dividends. Chart shows that this wants to drop below $3 it has followed EXPR to the T so would wait. Negative momentum is building
"Chico's debt is officially over $1B. From their 2nd quarter report:Current liabilities (ST debt): $438MNoncurrent liabilities (LT debt): $638MTheir total debt is a staggering $1.076B or nearly $10/share.They will not get out of this mess.Here is another sources that proves that debt is over $1B. Macrotrends is lumping ST and LT debt, but they have the same amount that Chico's reports in their quarterly report.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHS/chicos-fas/debt-equity-ratio"
CHS used last quarter to writedown Goodwill and shield future earnings. Smart move. They reduced corporate costs. They are renegotiating leases. All in all brilliant moves to greatly increase earnings in the future. Zacks as usual is a follower not a leader in assessing stocks. Short away. The squeeze will just lead to higher and higher prices when it starts.
"Personal note to the CHS Board of Directors...Tick, tock..."
"The question is will CHS hit 79 cents in the 3rd quarter or after earnings release? CHS is carrying massive debt. How much more can they accumulate before they have to declare bankruptcy? They can only tolerate negative quarters for so long. The retail sector may have permanently changed, especially women's apparel. Women will not shop for clothes on line and CHS can only close so many stores. The writing on the wall already may be there as Zack's, Jeffries Financial, and Argus Research all point too. Chunky selling ended the calendar quarter and is starting the next. Nearly everyday, there is a another red candle. The chart says lower prices ahead."
"IMO the BoD and management of CHS needs to consider transferring from the NYSE to the Nasdaq.The market makers of this stock are not giving this stock anywhere near a fair value based on many measurements.It's widely owned by well known money managers, insiders and is doing everything right.I GUARANTEE you the market makers made a wad of money today.What happened today is BS."
This is a very good report.Short-sellers will be covering and the future of CHS is bright.
Anyone have any idea what is going on here? Afterhours at 3.25? Are there any acquisition rumors? This is really irregular
"The signs are there that business doing well, broad insider buying, restoring regular pay, these would not be happening id business was bad. We could have an easy double here.;"
Skip the immediate numbers and look at the market. CHS has a very focused clientele namely older women that have the cash to spend and like to shop. In this segment there's few competitors. Customers find little they want in Macy's or at Amazon. CHS has the opportunity to significantly boost sales when the virus limitations are lifted. Plus their move to internet sales is taking hold. I'm in looking for a rebound to 3+.
What’s happening
"Retail sales for April, flat to down a touch. The CV-19 horror took a very heavy toll on CHS balance sheet: negative working capital as 0f 1/31/21, and l/t debt up over $100m. Current pps 4.21 not sustainable"
"Non-store sales went up 8.4% in the overall market in April. Chicos is currently in that category with online sale in the niche clothing segment for the repeat clientele who buy only from Chicos. Once stores open up fully, it will be a double whammy for CHS."
Ludicrously oversold - bought my first chunk of CHS today. Great company and value at this price!
"Moving up slowly but surely. As more of the typical Chico's clientele get vaccinated, sales are bound to go up higher and higher each quarter. Waiting for them to announce restoration of dividend again. That will be super nice!!"
"The price action proved everyone wrong. In Wall Street, greed wins."
"WOW, 23% increase in digital sales over 2019 levels."
"36 institutions have sold out of CHS worth 4.97 million shares. The Canadian bankruptcy is not a good sign going forward. Once the trend line is broke, CHS will smash to new lows. Hyping the stock will not help."
This cleanup is done before every run up to the next level.
"Strong balance sheet, stellar management, unencumbered real estate, and explosive sales gains coming as the economy reopens to huge pent-up demand for women's apparel. The tailwinds are ready to set this into flight in the near future. Famed value investor Bill Miller has a big stake in it. And Will Meade tweeted about in December, calling it undervalued. Covering shorts will juice the gains. It very well could end up being the retail play of the year."
Earnings call very positive with expectations for margin expansion for rest of year.
"Fundamentals will prevail in the long run, as always. And they're just beginning to do that. In the meantime, you have to stomach the daily trading games, as always."
"Bonuses for management changed to be based on total sales in 2020 and cost savings in the third/fourth quarters. So J they did not vote themselves additional bonuses, but in fact modified the existing bonus structure to reflect Covid business impacts."
Realistic expectations for earnings anyone?
"The only blemish on the report is the lack of sales growth for Chico's and WHBM as compared to 2019. But that is likely due in large part to the store closures those brands have had. If as I suspect those brands are turning the corner, along with the explosive growth Soma has seen, then the stock should continue doing well and short sellers would be well advised to cover."
"South Park store in Charlotte, NC open and very busy on Saturday and Sunday. Looked very normal."
Is CHS like BBBY? Doubtful. Different products. So people selling today assuming all companies will have supply chain problems the same are most likely wrong. Good chance to buy cheap today.
This is a nutty decline - therefore a rational buying opportunity.
Macy's beat revenue and earnings estimates. Chicos will too.
over 8% dividend.
Nice 13% move up prior to earnings release tomorrow morning! Wonder if there was a leak??
"IMO, it will skyrocket to 7 and beyond as soon as this artificial sell pressure is released. Have seen before."
Just starting to watch this one... how safe is that big dividend?
"Interesting, CFO resigns to join a Company that has been struggling and replacing leadership for years and the Chico stock jumps 11 to 12 % Hummmmm!"

No masks means cruise ships will start up and thus sales for vacations.
"Chico's lost $47 million in the last quarter. They are not close to break even, though all of their stores are open and most of the cost cutting is done.. Where are they going to find another $47 million in cost cutting? Sales are stagnant, flattened or may be dropping. It is not growing. The D/E is obviously going in the bankruptcy direction. Despite all of the happy talk, Chico's is in severe trouble. Expect to see the price continue to erode. If next 2 quarters are flat (equally bad), then the future is set and there is no positive outcome. Those who continue to hype the stock are doing a disservice not looking at the underlying numbers. They are dismal. This was a very bad quarter. This why insiders are secretly selling their stock."
Great value stock with high dividend
The 2nd quarter is coming to a close and the best sales period for apparel sellers is fast approaching: Christmas.Just reviewed 2 of the companies websites: Chico's and WHBM.Chico's is having their semi-annual sale. Dresses are selling well in all sizes. I also noticed there were many people viewing different dresses. Anywhere from 80 to 150 people. It's wedding and cruising season. Seems to me a great time to clear out any leftover items in preparation for fall and winter clothing.WHBM was not having a semi-annual sale. However I observed the following.1 - Shorts of all types and sizes were selling well. As a matter of fact many items were sold out. Must be the heat (beach weather). I love the beach.2 - Dresses were selling fairly well. Especially the petite sizes.
What target prices do you predict for the rest of the year?
"The huge 19% drop doesn't make any sense in light of Chico's previous statement on July 18th. ""Given the progress being made on the Company's new operating priorities, Chico's FAS is today affirming its fiscal 2019 second quarter and full year outlook provided on June 11, 2019. The Company will discuss its progress, financial performance and outlook for the year in greater detail when it reports fiscal 2019 second quarter results."" I've asked Julie Lorigan (IR) for a comment on today's absurd drop."
Just reviewed all 3 websites of the major brands. Sales are over. The New Fall offering is on display for Chico's and WHBM. Soma is still doing some new Summer stuff.The 2nd quarter just closed on Saturday. So the 10Q and conference call should be coming soon. Additionally a look into the Christmas and full year outlook should be better known. Any positive comments would be well received.
Gap at $6.46 to $7.04 from November 2018. Gaps close almost always. So my target for this move is at least $7.04. Nice upside from $4.75.
Could CHS go to $30 in a short squeeze?
The board finally took action firing Broader.
"Mr. J has it wrong. The debt is a phony debt, it is value of the lease for duration of lease. This is in reality an expense which very conservative accounting places it in debt column. The lease payment is gradually paid, it is not like a bank debt or bond that the whole thing has a maturity date. Insiders have been buying a lot of shares, my spot check indicates stores are open. Do not discount the fact that having closed the stores for pandemic, there was a pent up demand so most likely rev is going to supersize on the upside. Do not forget just before pandemic sales were improving on better merchandising. I am buying today thanks to shorts like the J."
Whatever Broader thinks she is doing isn't working! Three years into her run and the stock price is 50% off! The Board needs to act! Now! Absolutely no reason to let a year 4 happen! Hire someone who knows how to address the merchandising issues!
"Meetings scheduled tomorrow for each brand. Either more cuts and layoffs or another reorganization. Probably a little bit of both! Time for the Board of Directors to step up, exercise their fiduciary responsibility, and make the one change that matters most!"
Per 10Q numbers D/E has gone from 1.1 1st quarter to 2.1 2nd quarter.They will not survive if they continue to string quarters like that.The 2nd quarter was crushing.Review the debt and equity numbers for yourself.LT debt went up and Equity was smashed lower.We'll have to wait and see what Macrotrends and Gurufocus say the real numbers are.
"Actually, I have to agree with Larry. I run a women's retail company myself (albeit much smaller than CHS) but after listening to the conference call this morning I have to say that it seems that they are doing the right things. If you look at it from a ""managing a retail enterprise perspective"" they are hitting all the metrics to come out of this in a much stronger position than they were in pre-pandemic. If it were not for covid I would have bet that they would be on a one way road to Chapter 11. However, the pandemic has given them the opportunity to restructure a lot of things without BK. It is going to take a few quarters, but if they keep doing what they are doing it should be a good invesment"
"Revenue projected to grow about 20% in next quarter. Earnings will be the same or higher even with more shipping expenses. Way over sold, down 35% from the high of $7.29 earlier this year. All of the reasons published by Motely Fool, Bezinga, etc that CHS sales ""plunged"" below 2019 levels is nonsense, and will be negated next quarter anyway. But this is what happens in a stock that is not broadly owned and can be pushed absurdly lower with massive dumps."
Can anyone give me a rational reason why this stock is down 20c the past 2 days while EXPR is up about 30c in the same time period? According to what I have been reading on both message boards CHS is supposedly in much better financial statement.
Cramer said today 8/4 that all of the mall owners reported strong sales and nearly full occupancy. The concern that the economy is going to shut down again is flat out wrong. CHS will report great sales. Buy this dip.
I wonder if today is what the wall st guys call capitulation. I bought a boatload of shares at $3.02 this morning.
Insiders saying it could jump as high as $7 by end of January
"Obviously word is getting out that sales are up, and earnings will reappear. Expect dividend reinstated by 3rd quarter."
"Larry asked me to explain ""Black Friday"", after my post was referring to the fact that at some point CHS needs to be able to turn a profit long term. I infer that he was kind of being a little sarcastic, as he knows that the term is most generally derived from the (old school) fact that most retailers do not turn an annual profit until that point. I will concede that on a general level. HOWEVER.... the selling cycle and information reporting has changed significantly since the days of R.H. Macy and Sears. Now, retailers have the ability in real time to control their inventories (just in time delivery), real time labor and sales reports, etc. In addition marketing is much more narrow casted, so they can target customers with loyalty incentives, etc which should allow them to control short term profitability different. The consumer has changed, they do not do all their purchasing in q4 anymore.In the case of CHS..one has to remember, that they have went plenty of quarters (pre-covid) without turning a profit... COVID was a gift (to CHS as well as a lot of other retailers), allowing them to essentially chapter 11 and restructure their operations without BK. With the wealth of info that they have on their customers, store flow and labor costs they should be able to look at their operations and know where to cut.For example, when we looked at 2021 we took a 3yr rolling average of sales and then cut that by 25% which gave us a pretty good idea of what sales would look like...it allowed us to match everything up and keep an eye on our bottom line.. Now, its a privately held small chain so things are a little more controllable...but its just like anything else...don't spend more than you make. With those numbers, we were able to create a workout program to be a debt free company in 36 mos..even with the pandemic losses.. The problem with publicly traded retail is that they live on debt, and do not focus on profit margin. IF CHS really wanted to generate shareholder value, they should focus on being cash rich and debt free....If I can get a discussion going, I would love to elaborate on my point, and quite frankly would love to hear from people on what their ongoing thought on retail.. so would love some responses"
"Here is a very eye-opening perspective on store closures, comments from buyers/shopper/employees. You can see that employees are disgruntled over low pay. Shoppers will not buy on-line (certainly to a much lesser degree). More stores will be forced to close. Read all the comments for yourself for an inside perspective of what it is like Chico's retail sector. Come to your own conclusions. It is not a good future.https://www.thelayoff.com/t/AfUKC2S#comment_form"
Looks like we hit the bottom already. Time to turn around. Oversold definitely.
"At this price, dividend yield is now 4.3%. Cash is king at CHS. Look for a quick return to $8.50"
Just how many shares short are you J? Or did you get fired and want to bad mouth Chicos everywhere you can?
"Not rocket science here; 25-26% of float short, eventually these people will sell to take profit and chico's will bounce and may even shoot up considerably depending on possible panic rinse and repeat. Chico's will not go bankrupt they have plenty of cash."
Reddit?
"There is another big potential problem with Chico's. 2 of the financial auditors are also executives, Mahoney and Walker. The role of an auditor is to be independent from the politics and influence of executives. Not in this case. The wolves are watching the hen house and tell you what you want to hear. When I heard that digital sales were 1800 basis points above last year yet sales were down only 46%, I knew something phoney Mahoney was up.Chico's is going to sink lower."
"on the bright side, all those sold shares dont have to be paid div. I just dont understand selling at 80% loss."
"Virtually, everyday there are blood candles on the CHS chart, open high, close at lows. Weak hands buy early and strong hands sell the close. Chico's will return back to $1. Institutions will sell into anything remotely green."
"$600 individual checks, $300 weekly supplemental unemployment. 20 million vaccinations in 2020. Looks like time to buy clothing for economy restart."
Sales are down 50% for year ago. Customer's not buying because most are not working or traveling and store cater's to work attire for women 40+. Going to be a while before sales get to anywhere near previous levels. On line is only causing lower margins and robbing struggling physical stores.
this looks good - and earnings should be great - thinking 10+ in September
Chico’s unleashes another round of executive firings today. Some very high level. News at 11:00.
"Looks like a temporary top this week. Still, CHS is going higher in the next 6 month. A good eps report plus a hint or a dividend reinstatement in late 2021 will keep the stock price moving up! Also, at current market price, chs is a very attractive buy out!"
Cashed out at 1.41 just before close. Between the election controversy and the virus I’m hoping to get back in near a buck again. Could be wrong but that’s my thoughts. Anyway I locked in my gains 
Next week.....Announcement about declining the Sycamore offer......high volume sell off......price going down.....more shorting of the stock...Valuator was saying something about buy backs.....so may be some buy back news.....Lets see.....Numbers wise I don't see any improvement till a year or so.....
Great volume today--over 5 million. It's curving upwards. Maybe volume good again Monday !
"We are going higher folks, will break the highs of Last week soon. Don’t sell your shares, 9 dollars is soon upon us."
"The world's largest retailer Walmart (WMT) says consumer behavior remains stable. ""We are not seeing a major shift in consumer behaviors"".People selling CHS are panicking for no reason."
What is the stock action telling you? Chunky blocks of shares are being sold daily. Institutions are selling. Store sales are flat or getting worse. We are not close to a bottom yet. 90 cents lies ahead.
a bit confused as to why things dive on reports of loss. we all knew reports would not be good.
CHSTracker... what are CHS online sales going into 2020... as a percentage of sales....?chicos has always touted itself as omni channel...
Product quality noticeably declining and salez reflect that
I'm predicting sales will be about $425 - $450 million.Not sure what analysts are predicting. However I believe they are predicting a small loss for the quarter.I would not be surprised if they breakeven or report a small profit. If so our new found short sellers will help fuel this stocks price significantly higher.We will find out soon enough.The perfect scenario would be if more people go short.
"What the heck, who is selling?"
"hoping for great day tomorrow little over 10,000 shares"
"Apparently whoever bought a whole lot of the $4 puts knew they could push the stock price down and thereby profit. As a friend once said 40 years ago, traders will screw their grandmother out of 10 cents in trading profit if necessary, and so it goes."
"Looks like a very interesting stock - great div, free cash flow, low debt, cash on hand, low PE - can anybody fill me in on why this has crashed so hard? thx! :)"
"Here is the Zack's article. If they are not bought out (extremely unlikely) they face bankruptcy ahead. 6 years of loses and debt to top $1 billion soon, but here it is:This once women’s fashion icon’s inability to adapt to the digitalizing world has led to a sales decline in the past 18 out of 19 quarters and shareholders have suffered. Chico’s revenue decline is expected to continue in the years to come.Chico’s bottom line has flipped negative, and its losses are accelerating seemingly every quarter. The business is quickly running out money, and this pandemic may be the straw that broke the camel’s back for Chico’s.The best thing that could happen to Chico’s at this point is an acquisition. Otherwise, I see this archaic enterprise fizzling into bankruptcy.CHS is soon to be a penny stock trading at $1.26. This low share price causes accentuated volatility, adding more risk to any investor holding these shares.Take AwayThe retail apocalypse is real, and the COVID-crisis is pushing brick-and-mortar retailers that haven’t adapted to the evolving consumer out of the market. Chico’s is just another domino teetering, ready to fall. There are significant systemic issues with this company, and I would not put any position on this stock at this time."
CHS up 25.60% today. Wonder how J feels about that!
"I find the following conflicting: If CHS is in such bad shape financially, then why, according to Yahoo finance, is insider ownership over 7.5%. When compared to a successful retailer like Target, it is a fraction of 1%. BBY and AMZN is about 15%+. Are the insiders at CHS throwing their money away by investing in a failed company?"
Premarket is all fake.
this is extremely oversold through short manipulation. we see a bounce back to near 6 in no time and maybe even seven. The earnings report was solid. Not buying this drop at a all and have added today.
"Let me start with, I am a believer!. However, Robert has a point..as an enterprise they eventually need to make a profit....others have why can't they. At this point, this stock is a good trade, but once their competitors as well as CHS gets back up to full speed they are going to have to compete, and low and behold become turn a profit. I am in this industry and let me tell you, from a technical standpoint, its not too hard to make a profit when you have a 50% gross margin, you just control your G&A....50% gross margin, get it together people.Now, it seems that they have a good team together but I think the BOD is inhibiting them from making the cuts and adjustments that they need."
How much it can go down? 4.50??
there needs to be a investigation
"It took a month to shake out the shorts last earnings call and the company was still losing money last quarter. Maybe less time this call, I was buying yesterday and more today ! Just a great opportunity while it lasts cause once it is above $6.50 next month it will slow down again."
Zacks said strong sell . So I think is the time to buy :D
Smart money bought the lows yesteday
The end of Sept marks the end of a quarter so there will be massive institutional dumping to show a lower stock position in CHS or a zero position in CHS for reporting purposes. Expect more selling until the end of the month.
Riots continue as stores are burned to the ground.
"Getting rid of Diane Ellis was a good thing for Chico’s FAS and their customers. At 60, she probably needs to move onto something more in her wheelhouse than the demographic Chic’s serves. The plan they have in terms of where to apply their focus is very sound and appears to target the areas that will drive the top/bottom line. The sell of is way overdone and we should see a quick move into the 5.50 plus range then a gradual climb as the strategy and executables grab hold. The website is fresh, and it should be a solid Christmas season. The deal with selling on Amazon will also show material results in 2019. This is an incredible entry point for the company whether you are long, or just want to profit into the next quarter. Still making money and the clientele is loyal when I survey some of my friends in the industry (quick calls, but successful women in the know and a couple in the business). Had to move fast on this one and glad I’m in..."
"Can someone clarify the $800+ million debt on the balance sheet? It is really long term lease obligations that are currently being renegotiated to cut cost and not debt?If the $800+ million is real debt, then no lender would ever lend to it ! Plus vendors would think twice before extending any form of credit for merchandise, supplies, etc. The only source of outside financing for business operations would be a stock offering (dilution) or from funds generated from current operations."
"There is $860 million in debt for 1334 stores.That is a staggering $645,000 per store to make up.Each store manager, each investor owes that money.Follow the debt/equity ratio. We will know what that is tomorrow.Institutions have made a big mistake."
"11/26/2019 Telsey Advisory Group Lifts Chico's FAS Price Target to $5 From $3, Maintains Market Perform"
"Macys has over $4 billion of real borrowed debt owed to creditors CHS has only $55 million with $140 million cash. Book is nearly $5. CHS is a bargain and is only down due to erroneous data driven selling. I've seen this error before when Office Max had $2 billion debt on its books, but when it disappeared the stock quadrupled. Go ahead and short CHS. The short squeeze will be all the bigger."
Wonder how long before dividend gets cut or eliminated?
"My guess is that short sellers expected CHS to miss and had lined up millions of shares to short. They went ahead with their sell strategy knowing they could overwhelm the market. Except it will only be temporary. As computers process the huge earnings beat (best performance since 2013), buy programs and buy recommendations will roll out. The end result will be a short squeeze to much higher prices. My suggestion - buy more today here at $4.95."
"Lease payments must be considered as recurring monthly debt obligations regardless of the number of months remaining on the lease. This is because the expiration of a lease agreement for commercial property typically leads to a new lease agreement. As of 2016, operating leases must be included in corporate accounting as liabilities or debt.The present value of a lease payment that extends past one year is a long-term liability. Deferred tax liabilities typically extend to future tax years, in which case they are considered a long-term liability or long-term debt. For this reason, Chico's is required to report their lease obligations (LT debt on their 10Q) and CHS AND MacroTrends accurately reports Chico's. Chico's is either unlikely or will not be able to negotiate any further concessions on lease relief going forward.As long as there are earnings loss coupled with debt increases, bankruptcy looms for CHS. Chico's total debt obligation stands at an insurmountable $1.15 Billion as reported on their 10Q."
"Anectdotal sightings of business activity do not translate into earnings, as many of posters here believe. Further, cash for the qt took a hit of some $15m AND l/t debt remained unchanged, yet with $149m, outstanding, for over 1 year...a portion of it s/b reclassed to current. Another hit to woarking capital, and this makes CHS grossly overvalued at $6.32."
I check back every week to see if the Board of Directors has exercised their fiduciary duty to fire the CEO. It didn't happen this week.
"Stores in my area were mobbed with buyers getting their shopping in after weeks or months of quarantine. I suspect sales were good this weekend although limited sales staff overwhelmed. Stores are short on help because somebody in accounting thinks talented people that can keep a store looking nice, run various computer systems and handle customers to generate relationships, will come work for $10 per hour. Absolutely absurd when Amazon pays anyone with only a heartbeat $15 per. This is an interesting case study on whether stellar sales performance can be achieved with an underpaid unappreciated workforce."
Ask is getting stacked at every move
Reports are Chico’s President “resigned” today.
CHS new target price has been lowered to 79 cents (see under Summary).CHS is carrying $5.50/share debt load which it will not be able to make up.Next earnings report will be critical to survivability. Stock will trend lower.
This is height of desperation to scoop up cheap.
"Does anyone else think something here stinks when 3 tradings days before scheduled earnings release, without any news, the stock goes into a rapid 10% decline on 2.5 times normal volume?"
News out.Stores to begin opening back up starting may 4th
100% manipulation. No reason to drop 2.3% on such a low volume.
We may touch a new 52 high in 7's approaching 8.
