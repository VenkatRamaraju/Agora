"Motley Fool article says the reason stock fell is because sales at WHBM and Chicos PLUMMETED 5% and 14% respectively. Huh? Compared to what? Obviously the sales were up over 40% each compared to a year ago, so I have no idea to what the author of this article is referring."
I bought at 5.00. Seems a bit oversold based on the excellent earnings report.
"WOW, 23% increase in digital sales over 2019 levels."
Is CHS like BBBY? Doubtful. Different products. So people selling today assuming all companies will have supply chain problems the same are most likely wrong. Good chance to buy cheap today.
"Went to a Chicos store 10/17. Clothing made in China, Mexico, Camaroon, Indonesia, and less than 15% Vietnam. Obviously management has changed sources quickly to bypass Vietnamâ€™s covid shutdown. Bodes well for earnings."
The stock is clearly under accumulation.
Something is up. Look at the volume today.
Zacks as of 10/27/21 ranks CHS #1 strong buy.
100% manipulation. No reason to drop 2.3% on such a low volume.
Drop below $5 on 10/22 was obviously to grab up stock with stops before it goes higher.
"How can one compare BBBY to CHS. BBBY sells thousands of items from soap dish to garbage cans, from towels to bedsheets and depends on a lot of suppliers. CHS is only women clothing and undies."
"Revenue projected to grow about 20% in next quarter. Earnings will be the same or higher even with more shipping expenses. Way over sold, down 35% from the high of $7.29 earlier this year. All of the reasons published by Motely Fool, Bezinga, etc that CHS sales ""plunged"" below 2019 levels is nonsense, and will be negated next quarter anyway. But this is what happens in a stock that is not broadly owned and can be pushed absurdly lower with massive dumps."
"IMO, it will skyrocket to 7 and beyond as soon as this artificial sell pressure is released. Have seen before."
"The only blemish on the report is the lack of sales growth for Chico's and WHBM as compared to 2019. But that is likely due in large part to the store closures those brands have had. If as I suspect those brands are turning the corner, along with the explosive growth Soma has seen, then the stock should continue doing well and short sellers would be well advised to cover."
Looks like we hit the bottom already. Time to turn around. Oversold definitely.
Great volume today--over 5 million. It's curving upwards. Maybe volume good again Monday !
Superb results. $8 pps is in the corner.
"My guess is that short sellers expected CHS to miss and had lined up millions of shares to short. They went ahead with their sell strategy knowing they could overwhelm the market. Except it will only be temporary. As computers process the huge earnings beat (best performance since 2013), buy programs and buy recommendations will roll out. The end result will be a short squeeze to much higher prices. My suggestion - buy more today here at $4.95."
this is extremely oversold through short manipulation. we see a bounce back to near 6 in no time and maybe even seven. The earnings report was solid. Not buying this drop at a all and have added today.
Over 80 cents per share yearly earnings equates to at least a $16 stock. Yet down to $5.25 pre market. Go figure.
