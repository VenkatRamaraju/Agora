Went to a WHBM. Salesperson said sales are increasing and they are meeting sales goals.
"on the bright side, all those sold shares dont have to be paid div. I just dont understand selling at 80% loss."
"I decided to buy this stock due to the packed store here in Fl every time I went in this winter, They say when it comes to retail check out the traffic, Chico’s is probably the most popular store in this area,"
"Meetings scheduled tomorrow for each brand. Either more cuts and layoffs or another reorganization. Probably a little bit of both! Time for the Board of Directors to step up, exercise their fiduciary responsibility, and make the one change that matters most!"
"Interesting, CFO resigns to join a Company that has been struggling and replacing leadership for years and the Chico stock jumps 11 to 12 % Hummmmm!"
"Larry asked me to explain ""Black Friday"", after my post was referring to the fact that at some point CHS needs to be able to turn a profit long term. I infer that he was kind of being a little sarcastic, as he knows that the term is most generally derived from the (old school) fact that most retailers do not turn an annual profit until that point. I will concede that on a general level. HOWEVER.... the selling cycle and information reporting has changed significantly since the days of R.H. Macy and Sears. Now, retailers have the ability in real time to control their inventories (just in time delivery), real time labor and sales reports, etc. In addition marketing is much more narrow casted, so they can target customers with loyalty incentives, etc which should allow them to control short term profitability different. The consumer has changed, they do not do all their purchasing in q4 anymore.In the case of CHS..one has to remember, that they have went plenty of quarters (pre-covid) without turning a profit... COVID was a gift (to CHS as well as a lot of other retailers), allowing them to essentially chapter 11 and restructure their operations without BK. With the wealth of info that they have on their customers, store flow and labor costs they should be able to look at their operations and know where to cut.For example, when we looked at 2021 we took a 3yr rolling average of sales and then cut that by 25% which gave us a pretty good idea of what sales would look like...it allowed us to match everything up and keep an eye on our bottom line.. Now, its a privately held small chain so things are a little more controllable...but its just like anything else...don't spend more than you make. With those numbers, we were able to create a workout program to be a debt free company in 36 mos..even with the pandemic losses.. The problem with publicly traded retail is that they live on debt, and do not focus on profit margin. IF CHS really wanted to generate shareholder value, they should focus on being cash rich and debt free....If I can get a discussion going, I would love to elaborate on my point, and quite frankly would love to hear from people on what their ongoing thought on retail.. so would love some responses"
"Mr. J, granted the situation at present is not good but fortunes can be made investing in companies that pull it through. When investing you make money in company not because how great they are at present but what is the direction, is it getting better or worse, second question is can they go through the rough times and survive. Every damn retailer signs lease and according to you then they are all loaded with debt and should be avoided. Focus on expense, focus more so on revenue, focus on management and if they have a solid plan to grow into profitability. The stock price has discounted a lot of bad and improvement in operation will reward investors handsomely. Quarter over quarter revenues did well despite having same number of days having shut down, the expenses went down, online sales grow well, management was energetic and came across as knowing how to turn this around. I think a 21% rise in stock price bears witness to that."
Great volume today--over 5 million. It's curving upwards. Maybe volume good again Monday !
Whatever Broader thinks she is doing isn't working! Three years into her run and the stock price is 50% off! The Board needs to act! Now! Absolutely no reason to let a year 4 happen! Hire someone who knows how to address the merchandising issues!
Something is up. Look at the volume today.
Gap at $6.46 to $7.04 from November 2018. Gaps close almost always. So my target for this move is at least $7.04. Nice upside from $4.75.
"Hey J.Remember when you said that apparel retail is doing better than 2019? here is a quote from...what do ya know, yahoo news...the exact same forum we are on.""Sales at clothing and accessories stores went from $22.5 billion in January 2020 to a low of $3 billion in April as the pandemic spread and lockdowns ensued, according to data from the Census Bureau. At $20 billion in January of this year, sales at clothing and accessories stores have gained for two straight months. That's still shy of the nearly $23 billion spent at clothing and accessories stores in May 2018, which represents the high water mark of the past 32 months, per Census Bureau data."" I put the link below, from Friday's article.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/are-people-about-to-buy-a-ton-of-new-clothes-post-pandemic-175615654.html?.tsrc=fin-notifYou seem smart, so lets start talking about how to make money...on a stock trading forum!"
"J. Serious question, do you actually own any CHS stock? Next question, you think that her comp is excessive for a person running as large of an enterprise. Another question. How much do you think their front line sales associates should be paid? I did read your well thought out response to the earlier response I gave you, and there were some very cogent points made. I just can not figure out where you are coming from on here? Are we discussing a stock trade?"
Reports are Chico’s President “resigned” today.
Drop below $5 on 10/22 was obviously to grab up stock with stops before it goes higher.
We may touch a new 52 high in 7's approaching 8.
Is CHS like BBBY? Doubtful. Different products. So people selling today assuming all companies will have supply chain problems the same are most likely wrong. Good chance to buy cheap today.
The stock is clearly under accumulation.
"There is another big potential problem with Chico's. 2 of the financial auditors are also executives, Mahoney and Walker. The role of an auditor is to be independent from the politics and influence of executives. Not in this case. The wolves are watching the hen house and tell you what you want to hear. When I heard that digital sales were 1800 basis points above last year yet sales were down only 46%, I knew something phoney Mahoney was up.Chico's is going to sink lower."
Macy's beat revenue and earnings estimates. Chicos will too.
"Institutional selling being reported reflects activity in the last quarter ( Q2). This includes March and April when many had to reduce position as a hedge or had to due to falling prices that hit sell limits. Or their investment policy dictated mandatory sales for certain events.The target market that CHS sells to is a higher income group. This market does not just disappear. The survivors who sell in this retail market will have a bigger slice of market share once we return to normal. Management 101 says in bad times, take advantage of it by downsizing and eliminate unnecessary cost, close now nonprofitable operations and take write down so that earnings in future operations will more profitable."
Hedge fund putting pressure on Chico's. I'm up 42% and still holding. I think we see at least 9 bucks like it was trading years ago. It reached higher than that but I am trying to be reasonable. It's the old lady shopping favorite which includes me.
Goldman Sachs sells 2 million shares of CHS.Bank of NY Mellon sells 1.3 million shares.Prior to earnings release.
"The huge 19% drop doesn't make any sense in light of Chico's previous statement on July 18th. ""Given the progress being made on the Company's new operating priorities, Chico's FAS is today affirming its fiscal 2019 second quarter and full year outlook provided on June 11, 2019. The Company will discuss its progress, financial performance and outlook for the year in greater detail when it reports fiscal 2019 second quarter results."" I've asked Julie Lorigan (IR) for a comment on today's absurd drop."
"There are over 2850 job openings at Chico's. 2850!They only have 4500 employees, let's exclude Canada. They're gone.144 pages of positions at 20 positions per page.This stock is in huge trouble as everyone is abandoning ship.8-26 will be pivotal. We'll see who sells before and after.There is no way to spin this as good news getting to go out of business.https://jobs.chicos.com/jobs/retail/?page_jobs=1"
Zacks as of 10/27/21 ranks CHS #1 strong buy.
"Chico's debt is officially over $1B. From their 2nd quarter report:Current liabilities (ST debt): $438MNoncurrent liabilities (LT debt): $638MTheir total debt is a staggering $1.076B or nearly $10/share.They will not get out of this mess.Here is another sources that proves that debt is over $1B. Macrotrends is lumping ST and LT debt, but they have the same amount that Chico's reports in their quarterly report.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHS/chicos-fas/debt-equity-ratio"
where is Jeremy and his magical PUTS...?
betting my lifetime savings on CHS. Wife doesn't know.
told you $7 was a high price.. fully pricing in recovery
Finally she’s fired under her rule the stock dropped 50 percent looking to a real merchant not a bean counter to turn around these stores have fab clothes
I bought at 5.00. Seems a bit oversold based on the excellent earnings report.
"Macys has over $4 billion of real borrowed debt owed to creditors CHS has only $55 million with $140 million cash. Book is nearly $5. CHS is a bargain and is only down due to erroneous data driven selling. I've seen this error before when Office Max had $2 billion debt on its books, but when it disappeared the stock quadrupled. Go ahead and short CHS. The short squeeze will be all the bigger."
This is a nutty decline - therefore a rational buying opportunity.
"What the heck, who is selling?"
Great dividend yield. Chicos and ASNA are both in the doghouse on wall st big time these days.Wall St acting as if they both are going bankrupt. Not so sure this is happening. IMHO over reaction. Chicos closing underperforming stores and ASNA trying to shed divisions. They are not on life support. IMHO both great spec plays for nice rebounds.
"Lease payments must be considered as recurring monthly debt obligations regardless of the number of months remaining on the lease. This is because the expiration of a lease agreement for commercial property typically leads to a new lease agreement. As of 2016, operating leases must be included in corporate accounting as liabilities or debt.The present value of a lease payment that extends past one year is a long-term liability. Deferred tax liabilities typically extend to future tax years, in which case they are considered a long-term liability or long-term debt. For this reason, Chico's is required to report their lease obligations (LT debt on their 10Q) and CHS AND MacroTrends accurately reports Chico's. Chico's is either unlikely or will not be able to negotiate any further concessions on lease relief going forward.As long as there are earnings loss coupled with debt increases, bankruptcy looms for CHS. Chico's total debt obligation stands at an insurmountable $1.15 Billion as reported on their 10Q."
Chico's debt to equity ratio currently stands at an astounding 1.98 according to Macrotrends and 2.5 according to Gurufocus.Long term debt has steadily increased while equity has shrunk by 70%. Both are trending in opposite directions. CHS is approaching negative equity!D/E ratio is one of the highest in the business as Chico's will soon be in creditor's hands.To put things into perspective JCP D/E is 3.This trend will not reverse and cannot be rectified. This trend will decide the fate of CHS. I think you know what will happen.https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CHS/chicos-fas/debt-equity-ratio
"Strong balance sheet, stellar management, unencumbered real estate, and explosive sales gains coming as the economy reopens to huge pent-up demand for women's apparel. The tailwinds are ready to set this into flight in the near future. Famed value investor Bill Miller has a big stake in it. And Will Meade tweeted about in December, calling it undervalued. Covering shorts will juice the gains. It very well could end up being the retail play of the year."
Starting to get to levels where shorts will have to buy back. Will there be a few days of multi dollar moves?
"We may touch a new 52wk high everyday for the next few days, as the momentum picks up. CHS is finally being recognized as valuable stock with potential for reinstating dividends in the near future."
I wonder if today is what the wall st guys call capitulation. I bought a boatload of shares at $3.02 this morning.
over 8% dividend.
Over 80 cents per share yearly earnings equates to at least a $16 stock. Yet down to $5.25 pre market. Go figure.
"Went to a Chicos store 10/17. Clothing made in China, Mexico, Camaroon, Indonesia, and less than 15% Vietnam. Obviously management has changed sources quickly to bypass Vietnam’s covid shutdown. Bodes well for earnings."
"Guggenheim Capital LLC Sells 25,683 Shares of Chico’s FAS, Inc. (NYSE:CHS).Don't let the institutional selling get in your way."
"Personal note to the CHS Board of Directors...Tick, tock..."
"Jefferies Financial Group also issued estimates for Chico’s FAS’s anticipates that the specialty retailer will post earnings of ($0.19) per share for Q3, Q4 earnings at ($0.08) EPS, FY2021 earnings at ($0.98) EPS, FY2022 earnings at ($0.47) EPS and FY2023 earnings at ($0.15) EPS.Chico's has LT support at $1 per share. That is the next logical place to visit"
This is height of desperation to scoop up cheap.
"The only blemish on the report is the lack of sales growth for Chico's and WHBM as compared to 2019. But that is likely due in large part to the store closures those brands have had. If as I suspect those brands are turning the corner, along with the explosive growth Soma has seen, then the stock should continue doing well and short sellers would be well advised to cover."
"WOW, 23% increase in digital sales over 2019 levels."
this looks good - and earnings should be great - thinking 10+ in September
If JWN can't hold CHS has little chance of a beat.
100% manipulation. No reason to drop 2.3% on such a low volume.
Once the shorts realize it has bottomed out they will start to cover but retail has already bought the shares so up up and away it goes !!!!
"IMO, it will skyrocket to 7 and beyond as soon as this artificial sell pressure is released. Have seen before."
WHAT TOTAL FRAUD BY THE SHORT SELLERS. How many illegal shares being shorted today? This earnings report was blockbuster. I am so sick of the rampant manipulation tho.
"While the apparel sector has recovered 90% from from pre-covid highs, CHS has recovered 55%. Something is amiss internally. Debt is accumulating faster than normal while the executives get paid. CHS is doing everything wrong to sustain their business at investor expense. Let's wait for the 10Q numbers to a snapshot of the numbers."
"Chico's lost $47 million in the last quarter. They are not close to break even, though all of their stores are open and most of the cost cutting is done.. Where are they going to find another $47 million in cost cutting? Sales are stagnant, flattened or may be dropping. It is not growing. The D/E is obviously going in the bankruptcy direction. Despite all of the happy talk, Chico's is in severe trouble. Expect to see the price continue to erode. If next 2 quarters are flat (equally bad), then the future is set and there is no positive outcome. Those who continue to hype the stock are doing a disservice not looking at the underlying numbers. They are dismal. This was a very bad quarter. This why insiders are secretly selling their stock."
"Copied from below, where someone asked to compare the Broader era with the Dyer era. @mike, Way worse. Stock price was around $4 when Dyer took over. Got to almost $19. Broader took over it was around $16. She spent countless time and millions of dollars fighting off a takeover bid around $19. Since then, it's been single digits. She moved some people, which was necessary, yet, in every case, the replacement she hired was worse than the person she fired. She has no one in senior positions who is a true merchant. She doesn't understand the importance of driving sales. She, and none of her top execs, know how to drive sales. She's a bean counter by nature. She thinks every problem can be solved by cutting expenses. She's addicted to consultants, who tell her where to cut. When they fire her, soon I hope, if she's replaced with someone who knows how to attack the top line, the company will be fine. If they keep her, this company is toast. My expectation is that she stays through Q4 and is gone in the Spring. (To pursue ""other opportunities."") I've heard they already have feelers out in the marketplace."
"How can one compare BBBY to CHS. BBBY sells thousands of items from soap dish to garbage cans, from towels to bedsheets and depends on a lot of suppliers. CHS is only women clothing and undies."
"Interim President and CEO of Chico's Fas Inc (NYSE:CHS) Bonnie R. Brooks bought 28,700 shares of CHS on 06/14/2019 at an average price of $3.49 a share"
why are people selling going into dividends?
Earnings call very positive with expectations for margin expansion for rest of year.
RSI down to 33.17 so about as oversold as it gets for a company that is turning around and now profitable and beating on revenue as well as earnings per share. I am buying more here at the bottom.
this is extremely oversold through short manipulation. we see a bounce back to near 6 in no time and maybe even seven. The earnings report was solid. Not buying this drop at a all and have added today.
"Looks like a very interesting stock - great div, free cash flow, low debt, cash on hand, low PE - can anybody fill me in on why this has crashed so hard? thx! :)"
"We are going higher folks, will break the highs of Last week soon. Don’t sell your shares, 9 dollars is soon upon us."
"Mr. J has it wrong. The debt is a phony debt, it is value of the lease for duration of lease. This is in reality an expense which very conservative accounting places it in debt column. The lease payment is gradually paid, it is not like a bank debt or bond that the whole thing has a maturity date. Insiders have been buying a lot of shares, my spot check indicates stores are open. Do not discount the fact that having closed the stores for pandemic, there was a pent up demand so most likely rev is going to supersize on the upside. Do not forget just before pandemic sales were improving on better merchandising. I am buying today thanks to shorts like the J."
"The price action proved everyone wrong. In Wall Street, greed wins."
Ask is getting stacked at every move
"Can someone clarify the $800+ million debt on the balance sheet? It is really long term lease obligations that are currently being renegotiated to cut cost and not debt?If the $800+ million is real debt, then no lender would ever lend to it ! Plus vendors would think twice before extending any form of credit for merchandise, supplies, etc. The only source of outside financing for business operations would be a stock offering (dilution) or from funds generated from current operations."
"Does anyone else think something here stinks when 3 tradings days before scheduled earnings release, without any news, the stock goes into a rapid 10% decline on 2.5 times normal volume?"
How much it can go down? 4.50??
"My guess is that short sellers expected CHS to miss and had lined up millions of shares to short. They went ahead with their sell strategy knowing they could overwhelm the market. Except it will only be temporary. As computers process the huge earnings beat (best performance since 2013), buy programs and buy recommendations will roll out. The end result will be a short squeeze to much higher prices. My suggestion - buy more today here at $4.95."
"11/26/2019 Telsey Advisory Group Lifts Chico's FAS Price Target to $5 From $3, Maintains Market Perform"
"CHS stores have opened to full capacity and are likely to falter even more.Why do I say that?WMT experienced 3% sales growth last year.HD experienced 32% YOY sales growth.We are in the new normal. People's shopping habits have changed. Everyone is free to shop where they want or on-line. The apparel sector has recovered 90%, but not CHS. Something is wrong and share prices are likely to erode further."
Realistic expectations for earnings anyone?
This is like playing with FIRE ! ! ! Know when to FOLD EM. Stock is performing now like SEARS.. Plus local chico's store in my town is next to closed up Sears in the mall.. Scary ending ahead...........
"It seems unconscionable that this Board of Directors has stood idly by and allowed this company to be destroyed over the last 3 years. The overall market is up about 50% in that time and CHS is down about 60%. The Broader experiment has failed, miserably. It's not going to get better, because she has no idea how to make it better. Her forte is self promotion. She's not a merchant, and she has no concept how to improve a company that relies on astute merchandising. She's not a leader. And she has started to turn on the people she has hired. Her ""people"" are far worse at their jobs than the people they replaced. (Kind of ironic since Broader is far worse at her job than Dave D. ever was.) She needs to go. Soon. Now. And they need to replace her with someone who knows how to run a retail organization. If the Board does not act, then all Board member standing for election this year also need to go. It's as simple as that."
"Motley Fool article says the reason stock fell is because sales at WHBM and Chicos PLUMMETED 5% and 14% respectively. Huh? Compared to what? Obviously the sales were up over 40% each compared to a year ago, so I have no idea to what the author of this article is referring."
Looks like we hit the bottom already. Time to turn around. Oversold definitely.
"It took a month to shake out the shorts last earnings call and the company was still losing money last quarter. Maybe less time this call, I was buying yesterday and more today ! Just a great opportunity while it lasts cause once it is above $6.50 next month it will slow down again."
"Is there ANY chance of Chicos getting back to the thriving and growing profitable company it once was, or is all retail falling off the same cliff and Chicos doomed too? Seems like Chicos is scrambling to find a way to make money, opening stores on cruise ships. in airports, selling on Amazon, and home shopping network. They're still barely profitable (so far) and we have been getting a decent dividend since we've lost $10/share, but is this as good as it gets? I don't see any improvements and all I hear is after the fact excuses like ""we had the wrong styles"". Their last earnings miss of 3 cent drove share price down $2.50 and our once 3 billion cap company is now only 3/4 B. Another miss and results like last quarter and this company could be worth more dead then alive, book value is $5.19. Changes need to be made, QUICK!"
"The world's largest retailer Walmart (WMT) says consumer behavior remains stable. ""We are not seeing a major shift in consumer behaviors"".People selling CHS are panicking for no reason."
Brooks says Chico's has experienced double-digit digital growth over the past six weeks.
Bought and sold VHS but would be hesitant to buy even after today's drop. They need to eliminate dividends. Chart shows that this wants to drop below $3 it has followed EXPR to the T so would wait. Negative momentum is building
"If I have this right, Sycamore, which owns 6-7% of CHS, offered $4.30 a share and got rejected. They return a few weeks later and offer $3.50...this tells me they are signaling “give us a reasonable price to begin negotiations”...Meanwhile, the CEO picks up a 170,000 shares free of charge on May 1st...so IMO something is moving forward...time will tell..."
"Are you all dreaming after a disastrous quarter? Earnings -68 cents, sales down 27%, debt at record highs. I'll give you the real numbers when available. All this after all of the stores are open. Things cannot be worse than they are. CHS is in huge trouble."
"Revenue projected to grow about 20% in next quarter. Earnings will be the same or higher even with more shipping expenses. Way over sold, down 35% from the high of $7.29 earlier this year. All of the reasons published by Motely Fool, Bezinga, etc that CHS sales ""plunged"" below 2019 levels is nonsense, and will be negated next quarter anyway. But this is what happens in a stock that is not broadly owned and can be pushed absurdly lower with massive dumps."
Chico’s unleashes another round of executive firings today. Some very high level. News at 11:00.
"@Sidibid1, recently you posted that CHS had a $50m+ tax receivable (I think you deleted said posting since I was unable to find it)... that was to be received ""this summer"". Please explain from where this was derived, was it to be paid by US govt, or by whom? Further the current balance sheet has a tax receivable of $57,513, and NO OTHER RECEIVABLES...very strange for a retail chain like CHS, to have only a tax receivable. No credit cards, no individual accounts, or whatever is reported. If you contend the tax receivable is from the US govt, please know that CHS has not reported any Federal income tax payments, for some length of time, especially in the $50m range . Appreciate your input."
Superb results. $8 pps is in the corner.
"I am in The Villages in Florida and throughout the winter was in and out of Chico’s frequently, always seeing a wait line to check out and wait to use a dressing room. I think it probably is the most popular store in our location. I can’t understand the stock price not improving. Even Thrift and Consignment shops here have special “Chico’s” sections."
"Virtually, everyday there are blood candles on the CHS chart, open high, close at lows. Weak hands buy early and strong hands sell the close. Chico's will return back to $1. Institutions will sell into anything remotely green."
"Covered my short today at $4.95. Expect a small dead cat bounce to fill the gap. Then short again. Ultimately, this is a $3 or less stock. Just a matter of time."
"Getting rid of Diane Ellis was a good thing for Chico’s FAS and their customers. At 60, she probably needs to move onto something more in her wheelhouse than the demographic Chic’s serves. The plan they have in terms of where to apply their focus is very sound and appears to target the areas that will drive the top/bottom line. The sell of is way overdone and we should see a quick move into the 5.50 plus range then a gradual climb as the strategy and executables grab hold. The website is fresh, and it should be a solid Christmas season. The deal with selling on Amazon will also show material results in 2019. This is an incredible entry point for the company whether you are long, or just want to profit into the next quarter. Still making money and the clientele is loyal when I survey some of my friends in the industry (quick calls, but successful women in the know and a couple in the business). Had to move fast on this one and glad I’m in..."
Rising 100 sma is about to cross upwards over the declining but flattening 1000 sma. First time in a decade.
"Here is the Zack's article. If they are not bought out (extremely unlikely) they face bankruptcy ahead. 6 years of loses and debt to top $1 billion soon, but here it is:This once women’s fashion icon’s inability to adapt to the digitalizing world has led to a sales decline in the past 18 out of 19 quarters and shareholders have suffered. Chico’s revenue decline is expected to continue in the years to come.Chico’s bottom line has flipped negative, and its losses are accelerating seemingly every quarter. The business is quickly running out money, and this pandemic may be the straw that broke the camel’s back for Chico’s.The best thing that could happen to Chico’s at this point is an acquisition. Otherwise, I see this archaic enterprise fizzling into bankruptcy.CHS is soon to be a penny stock trading at $1.26. This low share price causes accentuated volatility, adding more risk to any investor holding these shares.Take AwayThe retail apocalypse is real, and the COVID-crisis is pushing brick-and-mortar retailers that haven’t adapted to the evolving consumer out of the market. Chico’s is just another domino teetering, ready to fall. There are significant systemic issues with this company, and I would not put any position on this stock at this time."
Skip the immediate numbers and look at the market. CHS has a very focused clientele namely older women that have the cash to spend and like to shop. In this segment there's few competitors. Customers find little they want in Macy's or at Amazon. CHS has the opportunity to significantly boost sales when the virus limitations are lifted. Plus their move to internet sales is taking hold. I'm in looking for a rebound to 3+.
