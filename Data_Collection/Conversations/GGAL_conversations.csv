"19.65 GGAL another 52 wk low...""Don't Cry for Me Argentina""The truth is I've already left you. LOL"
Even my little brother can make money off this stock. Do not know if it could go under 11 again but undoubtly it will go much higher than this. Leading bank in Argentina worth ten times less than a couple of years ago basically for reasons not related to the bank itsel. Keep buying.
"it hit $12.12 prior coming back down, "
Closing at 17
"I don't understand why argentine banks are selling so cheap? These banks are money printing machines, literally. Their inflation adjusted earning power seems steady, and most of these banks are very profitable. If could buy them all I would. my bets are on ggal and bbar."
What's making this stock jump up?
"Do not trust this downgrade while Argentina is finally getting on their feet. Same guys that recomended subprime bonds in 2008. Screw them. BUY GGAL, MELI , VIST"
Short now cover tomorrow at $2
"Blackrock playing hard to get afterhours...their investors feel framed so they are trying to get an extra dollar to their huge losses. But they just can not go against it, even mexican president AMLO has put preasure on Larry Fink from Blackrock. No way around it, if tomorrow it goes down would be wise to buy more. Price target for before the end of 2020: 17. This is 50 percent up from now. BUY"
"WHAT A RUN! what other stock doubled its price in these couple of months. Do not sell, just not yet."
This should do quite well with the falling dollar I would think.

"Took longer than I thought but finally is getting there. This stock had ridiculous valuation and it still has, tempted to see how far up it can get. 15 is a conservative target for now."
TIME TO SELL ; 7.5 SOON !!
This is way over sold / over reacted.
GGAL will rebound as soon as we get a hint that default will be avoided. Sooner or later this will happen. BUY
This is the bottom. I bought boatloads of GGAL at 19 with margin. From 38 to 18 in 3 weeks without gap even after near 52 week low.Good opportunity that doesn't come around very often.
The down cycle is done. Shorties should cover.
Argentina's economic is booming. It's about time.
"No deep pocket will consider argie stocks investable after this. This is trading stock, meaning it won't hold. I would be shocked if today's low will hold tomorrow."
"Today is another important day for the argentinian stocks. In few minutes the Internatiinal monetary fund will review the economic plan of Argentina. The aprobation of this plan will be another positive signal for the markets, and will have impact to the banks."
Where 4Q results? They should be on Feb 20...
Argentina has a socialist and very corrupt government. they expectation si that after they election they government must turn to more moderate un base of an agree with IMF and new económic secretary pehaps Martín Redrado who was formed un Harvard!
sorry folks there is too much money to make in the market why are you stuck with this stock?
"Sorry for my bad english. K want to say to issues:1) be carefull with how do you use the technical analysis her. You must check if all of the premises are verified (for example, no body has the capacity to influence the stock)...In my opinion the technical analysis do not apply here.2) This stock is a very good stock. this bank is one of the most Important banks of argentina. The stock is under value because the political context give it volatility. But the company is healthy.The last months had doubts about the capacity of the government to pay the debt. this situatin give to the argentinian market (and very specifically the banks) a big volatility.But the reality is that the government Will not have a lpt of problems to pay. Then, is very probable the stock will strong up."
"Is the market betting on a mid term election loss for the populist government? Or is it the IMF deal that is almos there. Maybe both, in any case argentine stocks are sky rocketing some time soon, valuations are ridiculous, you do not find that anymore in american stocks. BUY"

Congrats to those who were brave enough to buy in the low 20's and hold on. This has skyrocketed over the past few days.
Are we finally getting ready for take off? 2nd half of the year for Argentina looks very promising but usually stocks forsee the future so I would not be surprised to see a sharp rise soon.
"played the 34 to 36 move, 100 shares $200 profit, bought 200 @ 31.5...we'll see...gl"
Argentina its in a bear market itself.; Every time its go up is an oppotunity to sell

The more public servants you have, the more popular the goverment is.!!! . More bloodshed is comming, investors pockets going tiny... There is no light at the end of the tunnel, if public sector is not restructered. If not, then no argentine stocks and bonds will ever recover... If you want pain, come and buy some goverments bonds, they will restructure your bond may be next year. I call these type of people masochist... haha!"

I’m so excited to go long on this stock. I just don’t understand how Argentina can’t stimulate its economy! Seems to me like so many options would possible like-Issuing domestic bonds specifically to reduce the amount of pesos in circulation. Instead of printing more money.- Highlighting the weak peso against foreign currency as a reason for tourist to travel their.-Incentivizing foreign development of the tourism industry through hotels and travel accommodations -Spending more of the government’s budget on infrastructure projects to increase the tax multiplier and income of its citizens. Instead of raising wages and pension.-Incentivizing investment in its healthcare sector to provide private healthcare for its citizens.

"The biggest driver is, by far, the turning point to the right.

I think below 18 is a good entry point. The stock is not oversold yet. Plus the economic situation in argentina. Still checking it.
The Gvmnt took control for political use and to send into a deffault YPF (the mid national-private petrolium Arg company)that has never deffault its debt.Problems are serious; the Gvmnt do only dissasters.Nothing good aheadGGAL on its way to minimums
According to argentine tv (America TV); the debt restructering deal will either be signed or deadline extended this evening.
What happening here... chutiya

No where is showing bottom. Nothing strong to support this jump. It'll still be falling next week.
target price is 30$
The answer is not with the bank but with Argentina.
Argentina economic plan is delivering the first positive results. Exchange rate stabilizes and rates are diminishing slowly.Next we have to look for the crop. POSITIVE

The IMF board has to approve plan and House has to vote approval of budget 2019 .With these two issues Argentina is going up.
Still only at 9.2 X annual earnings so there is room for additional share price appreciation. Same with book value....its about .75% right now. Should be at 1 or above.

"Argentina experienced a currency crisis and stagflation in the last 4 quarters. (Annual inflation reached 47.6%, GDP fell by 2.5%, and unemployment and poverty increased).

"A lot of Argentine stocks are really running now, or correcting you might say from being extremely oversold since the 48% market plunge in August of 2019.

Loading up more on this downside which has nothing to do with ggal.
"I think Argentina economy will soonly rebound despite the idiotic Kirchner government. That is based on the followings: 1, Covid will be solved with vaccines 2, The commodity prices are rising sharply and Argentina economy depends on them 3, The IMF-Argentina will produce an agreement, where the idiotic goverment will make few economy reforms, otherwise they will not receive the IMF help, the IMF will give them an opportunity to pay later and with fewer interest rate 4, The USD currency will be not strong, becuse of the USA budget easining . Therefore the people will have a better mood and more consumption and economic activity will happen -> this can lead to more credits and a more stable ARG currency I think there are few reasons that this price cn further go down, but much more arguments, that they will go up, this is a very assymtric situation, what I like."
"Argentina president said it is their last offer, like he did so many times before. No need to worry, they have no choice but to fix this debt issue."

It remains to be seen whether the money actually gets there or not. This has nothing whatsoever to do with charts whether 2 or 3 years. Nor does it matter how oversold it is. It is really dependent on getting the IMF loan. Stay tuned..."
