"we have rebalance from funds when June 8th. MSCI left Arg.inside frontier IMHO. Good luck guys, the drivers are coming soon Mid term election, IMF and Paris Club. etc. on Arg.'Equities IMO."
Not sure that anybode would reply but does anybody have an opinion on this stock? Is it doomed?
Even my little brother can make money off this stock. Do not know if it could go under 11 again but undoubtly it will go much higher than this. Leading bank in Argentina worth ten times less than a couple of years ago basically for reasons not related to the bank itsel. Keep buying.
Why the stock is moving today... https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/fernandez-new-offer-to-creditors-on-way-deadline-moved-to-august-4.phtml
Step back and pull up 2 or 3 year chart. See how oversold this thing is. Nice double bottom. Weak hands are off. We are off to 25
The rocky road back to 11 soon to be finished.
up up up is all i see
good time to buy now. https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentinas-economy-rebounded-more-than-expected-in-reopening.phtml
The answer is not with the bank but with Argentina.
"Ok, I’m in !!! Let’s see what happens!"
"This estimate strength is actually enough to push GGAL to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggesting it is poised to outperform. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So really, Grupo Financiero is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20, a P/S ratio below one, and a strong Zacks Rank, meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-grupo-financiero-ggal-great-140002388.html"
Going upppp! Default arrangement is soon
"Some work 9 to 5, I work taking GGAL from 5 to 11. Third time now, easiest money I ever made."

Opportunity. 
this has to be the easiest money ever made..if you buy under 11 you will have profits guaranteed.
"tomorrow, april 5 big news !!! i’m guessing a 12% up"
It looks like it’s under accumulation the way you see volume spikes at the lows.
This is going to 30 in no time...
$14 very soon
"This might be the only stock that I would be willing to add up when is 5 percent up. Still a long run to go to 11, I have done it before and I will do it again."
I’m so excited to go long on this stock. I just don’t understand how Argentina can’t stimulate its economy! Seems to me like so many options would possible like-Issuing domestic bonds specifically to reduce the amount of pesos in circulation. Instead of printing more money.- Highlighting the weak peso against foreign currency as a reason for tourist to travel their.-Incentivizing foreign development of the tourism industry through hotels and travel accommodations -Spending more of the government’s budget on infrastructure projects to increase the tax multiplier and income of its citizens. Instead of raising wages and pension.-Incentivizing investment in its healthcare sector to provide private healthcare for its citizens.
The IMF board has to approve plan and House has to vote approval of budget 2019 .With these two issues Argentina is going up.
"A lot of Argentine stocks are really running now, or correcting you might say from being extremely oversold since the 48% market plunge in August of 2019. I bought and held on for almost two years on stocks like EDN, CEPU, CAAP, and then a month ago I dove deeper into Argentina and picked up some bank stocks like GGAL, BMA, SUPV. Glad I did now."
don't think we are out of the word yet. trend line still very negative.
"played the 34 to 36 move, 100 shares $200 profit, bought 200 @ 31.5...we'll see...gl"
I bought today for a quick 4-8%....
Time to cover your short
"I have been writing on this board what was going to happen since this stock was worth 5 bucks. GGAL has made a wealthy man out of me, hope someone followed me. Up to 17 is guaranteed to go up, the rest you are on your own."
CERO COMAAAA
"Argentina consumer prices rise 3.1% in May, in line with estimates"
"Hey Satnam, don't bother posting, you were on ignore the moment you posted you were short at $20 and never posted when you cover or cut your losses."

In this line, the analysts see Bolsonaro on the side of the markets. This vision will impact to the argentinian sotcks. I see a strong up tomorrow."

Anyone followed my advise when this stock was worth 6 a share??? Told you!
"Is the market betting on a mid term election loss for the populist government? Or is it the IMF deal that is almos there. Maybe both, in any case argentine stocks are sky rocketing some time soon, valuations are ridiculous, you do not find that anymore in american stocks. BUY"
"steady we go, up! "
What's making this stock jump up?
"Argentina experienced a currency crisis and stagflation in the last 4 quarters. (Annual inflation reached 47.6%, GDP fell by 2.5%, and unemployment and poverty increased). These indicators reflect chronic problems and with elections six months away, there are more immediate concerns like the peso is increasingly vulnerable to a sudden shift in market sentiment and the debt situation will move to center stage. THIS WILL END BAD..."
Buy buy buy! To the moon!!!
"Looking at 1yr chart, uptrend with cup and handle in the brew."

"Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. (GGAL): This provider of financial products and services has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising 9.4% over the last 60 days"
"well well well, it finally happened."
Why the uptick?
This is absolutely a temp set back. Will climb back later today to end of this week. Nothing to worry
Why are all short seller always bark when the stock go up? 
"Argentina president said it is their last offer, like he did so many times before. No need to worry, they have no choice but to fix this debt issue."
Any thoughts on how the election will affect GGAL? Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
"Argentina will benefit greatly during the commodities supercycle, Copper is almost at an all time record high. Argentina's stocks should triple in my opinion."
GGAL NEW LOWS AHEAD BEFORE YEAR ENDS.TARGET 4.5
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Are we finally getting ready for take off? 2nd half of the year for Argentina looks very promising but usually stocks forsee the future so I would not be surprised to see a sharp rise soon.

Watch! 20% gain in the morning
"The biggest driver is, by far, the turning point to the right. Even the government is moderating its own socialism. the hidden driver is low volume, large investments funds are still out because they still didn't notice the return to the normal. 1% of the capital of blackrock could buy out the entire argentine stock market. They still didn't ride the wave."
"I think Argentina economy will soonly rebound despite the idiotic Kirchner government. That is based on the followings: 1, Covid will be solved with vaccines 2, The commodity prices are rising sharply and Argentina economy depends on them 3, The IMF-Argentina will produce an agreement, where the idiotic goverment will make few economy reforms, otherwise they will not receive the IMF help, the IMF will give them an opportunity to pay later and with fewer interest rate 4, The USD currency will be not strong, becuse of the USA budget easining . Therefore the people will have a better mood and more consumption and economic activity will happen -> this can lead to more credits and a more stable ARG currency I think there are few reasons that this price cn further go down, but much more arguments, that they will go up, this is a very assymtric situation, what I like."
Argentina presidential debates start this month. With majority support of current President GGAL may go up to $15 and higher
"2021 will be rebound for Argentina, GGAL will easily double its price."
Time to start buying again. super bargain price for a bank that has a great room to grow in a country that many people still do not have bank accounts.
"I am here whistling my favourite tango and seeing my predictions coming true. It is not over yet, still leaving chips on the table for the big finale."

"Ok, hope someone made money with my advise. Apparently there is an agreement and default is avoided. Is it too late to jump in? No! 11 today or tomorrow."
"Sorry for my bad english. K want to say to issues:1) be carefull with how do you use the technical analysis her. You must check if all of the premises are verified (for example, no body has the capacity to influence the stock)...In my opinion the technical analysis do not apply here.2) This stock is a very good stock. this bank is one of the most Important banks of argentina. The stock is under value because the political context give it volatility. But the company is healthy.The last months had doubts about the capacity of the government to pay the debt. this situatin give to the argentinian market (and very specifically the banks) a big volatility.But the reality is that the government Will not have a lpt of problems to pay. Then, is very probable the stock will strong up."

"Congrats to all argentinian voters, GGAL ready to launch!"
sorry folks there is too much money to make in the market why are you stuck with this stock?
"I don't understand why argentine banks are selling so cheap? These banks are money printing machines, literally. Their inflation adjusted earning power seems steady, and most of these banks are very profitable. If could buy them all I would. my bets are on ggal and bbar."
"Got this from the news: The central bank lifted its Leliq policy rate to 45% from 40%, and said it wouldn't cut the rate at least until October."
"@carlos @rocket If you guys know what your talking about, then share with us your estimates of the number of US cents per dollar, bond creditors will receive after Argentina’s debt has become restructured."
The down cycle is done. Shorties should cover.
"So, the IMF is talking about lending Arg about 50 B. So the people of Argentina are protesting in the streets, much like the Greeks, because of the austerity requirements. It remains to be seen whether the money actually gets there or not. This has nothing whatsoever to do with charts whether 2 or 3 years. Nor does it matter how oversold it is. It is really dependent on getting the IMF loan. Stay tuned..."
"Do not trust this downgrade while Argentina is finally getting on their feet. Same guys that recomended subprime bonds in 2008. Screw them. BUY GGAL, MELI , VIST"
"so the last run was at $37.78. this run should be over$40, right? "
11 here we are!
I trust default will be avoided and this will be worth no less than 11 a share.
Instability is biginig to arise. Still 2 years left of Alberto Fernandez presidency. Who dares to bet money on stock with instability?? Everything can happen right now.
Argentina for a change!!!!

Is this a good stock to buy right now?
Zero rate hike from FED is good news for GGAL.
$65 is the ceiling if everything go well.
"Yesterday we saw the impact of the downgrade, from b+ to b, to the argentinian debt. we must hope these facts, that provoke turbulences over Argentine stocks. But I continue seeing that this stock (GGAL) is healthy. In my opinion, my recomendation is have hold"
