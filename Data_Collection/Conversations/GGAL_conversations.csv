"Argentina will benefit greatly during the commodities supercycle, Copper is almost at an all time record high. Argentina's stocks should triple in my opinion."
"They seem extremely close!!!“Morgan Stanley expects a deal in the third quarter that would value the bonds at 45 to 50 cents on the dollar. Noticias reported Friday that the two sides were 14 points apart, with creditors seeking 59 cents on the dollar and the government offering 45 – more than its original offer of 32. Others told the magazine the distance was down to 10.”https://www.google.dk/amp/s/www.batimes.com.ar/news/amp/economy/government-puts-new-offer-on-table-as-debt-talks-heat-up.phtml"
"Nice comeback today, upside force for GGAL is unstoppable!"
"Looking at 1yr chart, uptrend with cup and handle in the brew."
Time to start buying again. super bargain price for a bank that has a great room to grow in a country that many people still do not have bank accounts.
"Congrats to all argentinian voters, GGAL ready to launch!"
"Under Analysis section of this page, 4 strong buys and 5 holds; $1.84 average estimated earnings; and $10.41 share price target."
"I have been writing on this board what was going to happen since this stock was worth 5 bucks. GGAL has made a wealthy man out of me, hope someone followed me. Up to 17 is guaranteed to go up, the rest you are on your own."
"Some work 9 to 5, I work taking GGAL from 5 to 11. Third time now, easiest money I ever made."

"This might be the only stock that I would be willing to add up when is 5 percent up. Still a long run to go to 11, I have done it before and I will do it again."
Argentina has a socialist and very corrupt government. they expectation si that after they election they government must turn to more moderate un base of an agree with IMF and new económic secretary pehaps Martín Redrado who was formed un Harvard!
Are we finally getting ready for take off? 2nd half of the year for Argentina looks very promising but usually stocks forsee the future so I would not be surprised to see a sharp rise soon.
"good times ahead, buy more."
"Good upward move for GGAL, if nothing goes really wrong the road to 15 will be smooth and quick."
"I don't understand why argentine banks are selling so cheap? These banks are money printing machines, literally. Their inflation adjusted earning power seems steady, and most of these banks are very profitable. If could buy them all I would. my bets are on ggal and bbar."
steady it goes
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Argentina for a change!!!!
"Ok, hope someone made money with my advise. Apparently there is an agreement and default is avoided. Is it too late to jump in? No! 11 today or tomorrow."
Why the stock is moving today... https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/fernandez-new-offer-to-creditors-on-way-deadline-moved-to-august-4.phtml
"Is the market betting on a mid term election loss for the populist government? Or is it the IMF deal that is almos there. Maybe both, in any case argentine stocks are sky rocketing some time soon, valuations are ridiculous, you do not find that anymore in american stocks. BUY"
Still only at 9.2 X annual earnings so there is room for additional share price appreciation. Same with book value....its about .75% right now. Should be at 1 or above.
"2021 will be rebound for Argentina, GGAL will easily double its price."
up up up is all i see
"GGAL is an indirect way of investing in commodities, for those who are coming in late. So is PAM and a few other severely undervalued Arg. securities. The opportunity window is now wide open, but probably not for long."
"The biggest driver is, by far, the turning point to the right. Even the government is moderating its own socialism. the hidden driver is low volume, large investments funds are still out because they still didn't notice the return to the normal. 1% of the capital of blackrock could buy out the entire argentine stock market. They still didn't ride the wave."
"If the dollar falls like I think it will, this should be in the mid-twenties."
I like how the smart money is shorting the stock but loading calls to oct.
"I am here whistling my favourite tango and seeing my predictions coming true. It is not over yet, still leaving chips on the table for the big finale."
Is that forward PE really 3? JP Morgan's is 14. We could see $50.00 once this gets going. Just my opinion.
Instability is biginig to arise. Still 2 years left of Alberto Fernandez presidency. Who dares to bet money on stock with instability?? Everything can happen right now.
"we have rebalance from funds when June 8th. MSCI left Arg.inside frontier IMHO. Good luck guys, the drivers are coming soon Mid term election, IMF and Paris Club. etc. on Arg.'Equities IMO."
"well well well, it finally happened."
good time to buy now. https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentinas-economy-rebounded-more-than-expected-in-reopening.phtml
Argentina's economic is booming. It's about time.
I’m so excited to go long on this stock. I just don’t understand how Argentina can’t stimulate its economy! Seems to me like so many options would possible like-Issuing domestic bonds specifically to reduce the amount of pesos in circulation. Instead of printing more money.- Highlighting the weak peso against foreign currency as a reason for tourist to travel their.-Incentivizing foreign development of the tourism industry through hotels and travel accommodations -Spending more of the government’s budget on infrastructure projects to increase the tax multiplier and income of its citizens. Instead of raising wages and pension.-Incentivizing investment in its healthcare sector to provide private healthcare for its citizens.
This is what I have been talking about!!!11 bucks a share and it is still cheap! Time to cash in some profit but leaving some chips on the table. Upside potential still huge for GGAL
"Grupo Financiero Galicia S.A. (GGAL): This provider of financial products and services has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings rising 9.4% over the last 60 days"
"$12 before hours. Hope $12 holds. Those of us who placed a bet on Argentina resolving its debt pricing with creditors, especially BlackRock, have been rewarded as of now. I'm holding."
