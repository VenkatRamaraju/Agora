Years ago this company was on nearly bankruptcy
"Glad I waited to buy, looks like 115 is incoming…"
Buy now! 
Love the company but the chart is clearly in a downtrend. Will short to buy shares with
"Garmin has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $4.2 billion and earnings of $5.16 a share. Its operating margin is 25.18%, which ranks better than 96% of the companies in Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Garmin is ranked 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability. This is the revenue and net income of Garmin over the past yearshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/garmin-stock-appears-significantly-overvalued-201245963.html"
Down big on modestly heavy volume and no news. I hope this was just one of those periodic hedge funds rebalancing their portfolio.
Amazing earnings report one more time. This company never disappoints
proud share holder of 50 more shares thanks to price drop.
"What happen to GRMN this morning？Suddenly down 7 bucks, time to add more"
Surely you didn't think valuation doesn't matter. Hence why it's falling.
"A hoarse reaction to another very good qtr, but the softer guidance for the year gave investors a reason to take some off the table. Garmin investors set the bar very high and for good reason. Today's drop creates a buying opportunity for new investors. Me, I'm long and plan to stay long. IMO Garmin is a great company with a stellar balance sheet and great dividend."
Added some at $148. It's right near the 200 and I like my chances here. Don't listen to those that say its going to $100 lmao
Looks like down on Apple news- great buying opportunity.
"Perfect time to add to a position. They crushed earnings and will continue to do so even while guiding lower. This is what GRMN does! They are and will still experience great growth, have some of the most solid financials around, have direct to consumer sales, and product pricing control. All this to combat and ride out inflationary times while giving out a generous dividend!"
Folks wth is going on? I see $14 in the red in after hours. Are we seeing big money rotation?
low volume stock that always trends higher and higher
Is that really how little debt they have? I'm from KC and I didn't even realize that. That is almost unheard of. Great position going forward for long term survival.
Why does anyone still buy Garmin GPS device when cell phone has built in GPS?
It looks like some buying to build positions before what might be another blowout quarter.
Good entry at this $148 level?

Yikes. Love this company and stock. Bummed to see it crushed yesterday. Weighing whether I should buy the dip or wait to see if going down more.
"Weds 27th ER. GRMN another home run, increase sales and maintaining 20+% margins. increased the dividend, maybe a stock buy back program announcement? I hoping for the best."
"As we all know, Garmin reports Wednesday morning. At an amazing level, this is a very steady growth company with a beautiful balance sheet but from quarter to quarter can be subject to cyclic forces.Watch the watch business! Garmin continues to prioritize this known growth business, which should stress out the Fitbit investors; there isn't room for three players here. Apple needs to look over their shoulders too, as there is little or no real IP barrier to keep Garmin out of the med biz.The aviation business is gaining altitude with what I perceive as Garmin's improved targeting of different sectors of aviation by having high margin offerings for cabin class aircraft flown by paid professional crews, while staying competitive in the tough but large general aviation sector. The earnings call will no doubt mention their large volume of customers performing FAA mandated ADS-B upgrades. Unlike low end ADS-B competitors, I expect Garmin customers to be taking the opportunity to upgrade other areas of their panel while they are at it; That new GTX-345 will go nicely with GTN-650 or 750 which represents a damn nice up-sell.Smooth sailing with the marine products, but this is a tough business with legacy players being kept honest by Garmin. Simrad, RayMarine etc have responsible answers to Garmin's fine marine products.I anxiously await Wednesday early AM, and will look forward to a recording of the earnings call. For shareholders, any market response is a high quality problem; I would like to accumulate more if possible."
got the shout out on CNBC half time report for final trades today!
my cost basis is around 24 after all the dividends received over the years
I guess this drop is forcing me to buy some more. It's getting too big in my portfolio though.
"Andrew, if you liked it in 2007, why did you not buy more at a fraction of the price in the years after 2007"
"Where's the love? Debt-free, growth, value, and income. GRMN is a solid (long) presence in my portfolio..."
"Nothing wrong with GRMN. They have a niche in the industry, have direct consumer pricing control, and reliable revenue with major partners, including the US Gov."
"This is a great stock, the chart speaks for itself, amazing trend following, highs and low are always higher. For sure a keeper"
"Definitely shocking (especially as long time Garmin product owner), but I got the feels GRMN is pulling a YETI! Reaching an ATH, then floating downward ever so slowly enjoying the view. Now we’re heading to a place a bit more comfortable to chill out for while before another rise in due time- or something like that!? LolThe fundamentals are always going to be there, this is just GRMN taking a breather right now. I bought in at $140 so I’m waiting for a dip to buy more."
Great products. Best electronics around. Shame about the stock price
Their Golf Simulator is going to be a HUGE seller. It releases soon.
Crazy to see GRMN red on green days. Likely some portfolio shifting and profit taking.
"As usual, Garmin crushes estimates, raises guidance, and the stock is selling off on a strong market day. Should be back up to 90, where it was a few months ago. Some stocks like this just get no market respect. Probably didn’t like the limited growth in outdoor."
"Maybe GRMN business is being hurt from the massive port tie-ups, in that they can't get their products from Taiwan."
Almost everyday is a new ATH. Love it !
Can someone please explain why it’s down so much today after earnings seemed really good?
"Starting to buy in tiers below $70Great products, decent company."
