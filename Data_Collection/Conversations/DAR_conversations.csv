"Very nice, my Darling!Nice revenue beat leading to + 42% surprise on earnings per share at $1.17"
"Hi, new to this thread. Not new to fossil and renewable fuels. Thx for good posts. Since Dec. ‘20, I did DD and like the VLO-DAR DGD JV in Norco, LA. This week, reassessed, decided to exit VLO and go for DAR, stock, selling cc’s and BTO ‘22-‘23 C’s, as less baggage, while still getting VLO refinery expertise. GL2All."
"Man today was painful, I was surprised how much the stock dipped with the market and even more surprised it didn’t come back. Consumer spending down the reason? I know it’s considered consumer staples."
I'm anticipating that $74 is the new floor and $81 is the new high. Usually fluctuates by around $7 swing. Pullback after earnings since it seems the increase is built into recent activity.

"Don’t ask me how I know, but trust me when I say Darling isn’t going anywhere, and trust me when I say you are looking at a nearly 100% return in a year maximum. Maybe sooner, but even before then try and pick it up if it goes on a down trend. Just trying to help out the very few who comes to this board."

With the oil surge this company should benefit significantly. It is lagging XLE.
Still think this is waaaay oversold. I really believe it is just one of those under the redar non tech stocks that people are overlooking.

Strong earnings Beat estimates on both revenues and earnings
"I'm ew to the board. Bought my shares last spring/summer and have tripled up. I really only try to pick companies that are profitable and that I believe in for the long term. Looking for the board regulars to comment please. In general, I feel like the markets are in a big ole bubble. DAR tracked for years with very little growth in stock price, but in the last year has rocketed....making me wonder is this isn't at risk of popping with that bubble and dropping hard. At the same time, I'm pretty intrigued by the business model. Taking waste streams and recovering products of value. My background is engineering in food processing, from the farm products to consumer package. What I saw during the last thirty years was a lot of new revenue generated by recovering byproducts, stripping expensive flavors, colors, essences, etc. We always used everything but the oink (if citrus oinked). Nothing of value went to waste. Sounds like DAR. A couple of the recent DAR press releases were for new product lines from their existing processing streams. So it looks to me like a lot has changed in the last couple of years for DAR. Is it real expansion and revenue growth? Where is it coming from? I'll have to look into the fuel tax credits posted and commented on previously here. I need to make a decision whether to cash this in or hold it. I'm feeling pretty strongly to hold. Thanks."
"I don't know what is going on with DAR but thankfully I got stopped out this morning. This is what stops are designed to do, protect your capital!"
"Anyone know if the Diamond Green Diesel expansion is complete yet? Supposed to be mid-4th qtr, so we should be there soon."
I don’t see any reason for this stock to dipping so low after earnings and all the analyst upgrades. So painful!
Was this the most under radar stock of the last year? More than tripled in price and nobody talks about it.
