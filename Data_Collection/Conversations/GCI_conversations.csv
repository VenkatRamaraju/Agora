Listen to Bill Miller:https://millervalue.com/deep-value-strategy-1q21-letter/500% or more sounds good to me
Can someone check on Bee right now? He had a panic attack when the stock rose 1% when it was at $5. I can only imagine how he’s feeling right now.
Visionary company. Looks to be a start-up http://localzznetwork.com/directory/the-localzz-network-a-bold-marketplace-and-media-company-article-83.aspx
Huge call buying
buy the dip - this company's digital business is a winner
What would USA Today’s circulation be if hotels didn’t hand them out for free?
"5. We know for a fact Dynex Capital NYSE $DX investors Barry Igdaloff, Howard Amster (Todd Emoff, Thomas Akin) and Manny Friedman/Neal Wilson co CEOs of EJF Capital www.ejfcap.com and Wesley Edens, Peter Briger co CEOs of Fortress www.fortress.com wholly owned subsidiary of Softbank $SFTBY Masa Son, CEO and ex Fortress executive Rajeev Misra now CEO of www.visionfund.com (Michael Huang, Quant at Fortress and NRZ) are WORLD CLASS MREIT investors aka experts in NOVC CCR cleanup call rights per SRTA Section 5.04 see NOVC 2007 Q3 10Q. NOVC and CPA firm Boulay Group by focusing in on Fair Market Value (page 25 of 10K) of CCR create FUD mislead from disclosing the future plans of rich, seasoned collateral assets to most $3B RMBS, Non-QM aka subprime portfolio. Current Value of CCR mean NOTHING it is the future plans to use Collateral Assets (per Section 5.04 if Service Rights Transfer Agreement see back of Q3 2007 10Q) that can be leveraged/resecuritized at NIMs net interest margins of 500 Bpts. $3Billion times x same leverage as $DX, $NRZ $45Billion times x NIM 5% = $2.3Billion. This creates a 3.30 to 5.50/share annual dividend estimate. 5.a. This can be finance by shelf offering already approved by shareholders for Preferred Stock P/S Series F defined in $NOVC Oct 2018 Proxy 14A page 12 (prices one NOVC common right to dividend/vote at Mass Mutual cost basis $2.33/one common). These investors restructured Dynex Capital $DX together, Fortress further restructured $NCT into $DS after spinning off $NRZ, $SNR and NEWM now $GCI, they restructured public companies with the same attributes to $NOVC including $OCN Servicer of NOVC $3B RMBS Portfolio, One Main $OMF, Mr. Cooper $COOP which merged $3.8B with Fortress 70% owned Nationstar, Impac Mortgage Holdings $IMH, Capstead Mortgage $CMO used by Fortress to camouflaged Fortress ownership of Dynex Capital $DX which Wesley Edens, COB restructured 2000-03 with Barry Igdaloff (Chairman of $NOVC and served on DX Board for 20 years) and his crew, on and on."
I like to see this my fellow longs!!!!
Quiet board. Did all the shorts run off? We need a price target raise and dividend back. Good luck fellow longs.
HYPOCRISY ALERT: It’s laughable to see Gannett’s AZ Republic and Dems going out of their way to tar and feather a Republican Governor (which I think may be justified) while totally ignoring the Donkey/Jackass in the room—a demented President who clearly has his hand in his son’s cookie jar. I’d call that “Hermit Crab Justice”—where one arm of the law is much longer than the other.
"The debt reduction in 2021 alone should lead to an increase in equity value of 3$ per share and in case the valuation metrics will adjust to peers, 14$ will be added to share price"
Good News for GCI! Inflation has caused staplers to increase in value!
"I'm a small shareholder. I would buy more as a turnaround (post-covid), if the editors of GCI papers weren't soooooo left-wing. Difficult to invest in something you believe is mired in one-sided political slant. Could perhaps double their readership, if not such one-sided politically."
Down 13cents from the day before EC. Hope all y'all longs were smart enough to cash in your chips during the sugar high.
Can shorties try harder to push this down again? I like being able to buy in at near $5 price.
Like a bus driver running Venezuela. . .
Sold 6.95 probably where I bought it two years ago so technically a (opportunity) loss.
"Your corrupt socialist government told the FAA to prohibit drone flights from spying on its illegal alien processing facility under a bridge in Texas. Gannett, why are you ignoring this? Do you have no shame? Have any of your far left staff writers, or execs been to a socialist/communist country to know how they will be living if this continues? China, Cuba, Venezuela, Russia? Is that what they/you want?"
One thing that impresses me with GCI stock is that the volume is so low. It is clear that the stock is in strong hands and shareholders are committed to the turnaround story. With that said the low volume makes it difficult for institutions to acquire shares. If I ran a large Mutual Fund or institution it would be a time consuming task to build up a position. Perhaps this is why the stock is trending higher. There are institutions accumulating positions.
"I dare GCI to—for a change—publish an ENTIRE REPORT (the AZ audit report) to LET YOUR READERS DECIDE—instead of allowing your hack “reporters” parse, cover up, distort and spin the UNREVEALED INFORMATION. Gannett’s motto? Generalize, Conceal and Ignore. . ."
