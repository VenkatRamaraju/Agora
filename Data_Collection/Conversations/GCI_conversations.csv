"I bought GCI today due to heavy insider purchases, this indicates the stock is deeply undervalued: http://openinsider.com/search?q=gci"
"bot a modest amount so far today,mostly to play with the Shorts, under 35,000 shs. this stock feels like it could move up quickly with any plus forward statement, these Shorts are not that strong, judging from my buying today"
"This will go back to good days, I'm holding for long,"
"Congratulations GCI longs! A great move higher on significant volume. This is more than trading and a rise in the market. I think a big fish has entered (maybe Cooperman or someone else), another group is buying shares for other reasons (going private or a takeover), or the company is buying some shares back. GCI has $200M cash and cash flow from business but this would be a big risk in this environment but who knows. Just good to be a shareholder now. JMO GLTA"
When a Company re-instates the 401K match you have to pay attention.
"how can one not bottom feed here? Ive thrown down 2000 shares. prepared to lose it all just to see where this thing goes. sum of its parts are worth more than market cap. let's do this. I hope to sell this for 20k. in five years. until then, I will tuck it in a shoe box and never think of it"
"I was amazed yesterday at the many ways the webcast earnings call were being interpreted by posters on this board, oddly negatively. To check my notes, I listened to it again. I'm more convinced than ever that Gannett at this price level is a steal. And I suspect big buyers and analysts might rethink their hard line positions and help get GCI out of this crapshoot trading range."
How many shares everyone holdin on to??
pretty quiet here???? lets see some gains!!!!
If someone could explain to me why this stock would jump over 100% due to the news of the US economy exceeding employment estimates in June but then drop another 10% after the July employment report also exceeded expectations. What exactly is pushing this stock up and down?
Absurd pricing of GCI considering price/sales of 0.04; price/book = .15; market cap = $135 M vs. cash in the bank = $200 M. The stock is trading as though the company is going bankrupt. We need some aggressive move from management – perhaps massive stock buyback program.
"As a long-term Gannett holder, I finally am seeing some positive trading action in the stock today; looks like it is stabilizing in here. Quite possibly, this is the bottom. Just a gut feeling and I'll be the first to admit the possibility of being wrong."
Gannett is up 7.33% to 6.15
Several fortune 500 companies are not advertising on social media for the time being... this stock gonna benefit big time $$$$$
"More cash in hand than the market cap, 6 times book value to market cap, increased revenue while having free access to covid19 articles without paywall as a social responsibility decision. Good liquidity, good management, potential growth, some analyst in a fund is most likely trying to pitch his boss to buy all the float today! :)"
Congress is working a bill to make Google/Facebook pay newspapers for contentI believe this has been the major driver in the boomAny takers?
Why is the price difference between GCI and NYT?Aren't they both in the same newspaper industry?
GCI will among other things will significantly benefit from the vaccine coming on stream towards the end and beginning of next year. The .50 plus in GCI stock appreciation today is IMO the start of GCi being recognized as a solid long term investment.
"Home, the correct Moody's rating is positive. I paste it here: The outlook is stable.Bill Miller endorsing an under $5 stock and suggesting a PT of $25 is like opening the gates for the Robinhood investors of the world!! Giddyap!!"
Congrats all GCI owners - revenue up 4.8% over the COVID SHUTDOWN QUARTER! This company is a tower burning and is going to cave in. Staffers keep getting fired. Properties keep getting sold. Gonna run out of staffers and properties - then what?
Hoping today a good day
"LET THE SHORT SQUEEZE BEGIN, 22 MILLION SHARES NEED TO BE COVERED!!!!"
"If they can keep paying off their debt and successfully expand their digital marketing and subscription business, I seriously don’t know why this can’t be valued at 50 like the NYT."
http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4789483News of the Congressional Bill is starting to spread!

"@TOM, What do you make of GCI trading as though it is about to go bankrupt? I absolutely cannot believe the price action of this stock, considering that elections are going to be a major revenue contributor. The price drops have been relentless! And, NO WORD whatsoever from management; almost as if they have given up."
Will digital ad gains equal or surpass the print ad revenue that was lost? That's the key question.
This refinancing reduces interest expense by 28 million dollars a year. This money can be used to pay down the other part of the loan to help them also refinance that. Great job so far Mr. Reed.
Reed guided to same store revenue increase in the 3rd quarter. Shorts aren’t gonna be making money anytime soon…
What would USA Today’s circulation be if hotels didn’t hand them out for free?
GCI update: Added 225k shares today to over 1mm share position. Transcript provides interesting insights from CEO Reed regarding their multi year model paying just 30 percent of free cashflow to cover the 12 percent dividend. He discusses his own multi million recent purchase and how he sees upside of 3x to 4x current price over the multi year plan to greatly pay down the Apollo 11.5 percent loan and ultimately refi with more traditional debt after leverage comes down.
"$6 before covid and they did a billion dollar merger, thus there debt. Anyone that did their DD on this company is holding. Easily worth $5 and if good earnings and a new direction $10 plus. Largest media company in usa at less than $2 this is a gold mine"

"A confident outlook for Q2. April revenues down only 30%. Same tome costs saving measures of about 100-125 Mio. for Q2. Combined with the big cash pile, doesn't llok that bad."
Something's brewing...
"Anyone that wants to get schooled on this company and its direction should go watch the interview from last week with their Chief Revenue Officer. Digital subscriptions are up, they are positioning themselves to be a leader in advertising, USA Today has never done better, over 170 million have been reading their journalism during the pandemic. Go make your own conclusion!"
Looks like a couple shorts joined the chat today.
Finally the shorts on this board have shut their mouths.
Quiet board. Did all the shorts run off? We need a price target raise and dividend back. Good luck fellow longs.

"48,000 options in July should mean a big player is thinking this is going up soon"
"So unless I'm out to lunch here, Cooperman pulled something off that's not yet evident, as in a substantial short. But unless they intend on announcing a $1+ dividend next week their annualized yield is less than 5% so what's the BFD"
I love when my 04/2021 2.5 calls are up 103% in one day. I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship with GCI!!
Imagine Google trying to pursue the next big platform. Citizen journalismLocal/All news fully open platform for creation of local news connected to global platformsTwo birds in one shot by the way.
bought more today
The 100 million dollar sports betting deal is great and will generate much more than 100 million for Gannett. It will speed up debt payment and also lead to much more attractive refinancing deal in 2022.
Anyone knows any significant news that's driving it up besides macro factors?
"Big jump tomorrow AM. If they create a social media platform for the individual papers and a national one with USA Today, then they will own social media.Imagine going online talking to your neighbor and those across town. Plus with your local stores. Want ads? Amazon and eBay will cry."
"Poster ""wusseldussel"" appears to be a paid GCI pumper, most likely an employee. In 10 months, he or she has had scores of yf posts, only ONE that isn't right here on GCI's conversation. WHO ARE YOU, WUSSELDUSSEL? If not Michael Reed himself, I bet I could guess.But he/she is obviously not able to look at this company rationally."
"If the economy is going to be opening up, albeit gradually, GCI will also gradually begin to benefit from the increasing economic activity. PLUS, there is the really big added sales component of the 2020 elections with the concomitant massive ad buys. Also, let us remember that the stock market looks ahead 6 months to a year in determining current valuations. These observations lead me to think GCI is GROSSLY UNDERVALUED and today's price action supports that view."
"I added shares this morning in premarket. This is just too cheap. I understand the debt concerns as I have them also but with all the liquidity from the Fed and low interest rates , the possibility of the credit for buying newspapers getting passed, and the assets that this stock owns (real estate, and other businesses) that the discount in the stock price is very over done. This stock should rally soon. All just my opinion. GLTA"
Stayed green on a red day
"Listened to the cc yesterday, organic growth $1.5B in sales over the next 5 years but more interesting and near term is the company's upcoming NFT auction, GCI has the largest archives for this in the country plus upcoming announcement on sports betting/gaming online partnership. $7 a reasonable goal."
About time been holding that bag awhile! It a must I take some profit for an award! Lol
2s before June
Breakout if we hold $3.08 and no resistance until around $3.70.. Go Baby Go
"I could actually see the Federal government propping up GCI - especially at this point in time - can't afford to risk hyper-local news across America. I would expect that their digital clicks are off the charts these days, even if print advertising is in the toilet (what with retail more or less shut down)."
"Beginning of next week we should see some activity. Then beginning of august if they have a good report, this stock will bump to 4-5"
Gannett is up 15.85% to 3.80
I've gained my losses back and have an avg of 1.45 now. Let's go.
If it opens and holds in the low 1.20s early Monday looks like it will run to 1.40. If it drops below 1.20 all bets are off.
excellent action..longs waited and brought in the last of the sellers into last trading day of the year. While no one claiming anything here..it's a first good sign. You will notice we've made four attempts to get over $6.40-50 area since mid november..
FINALLY AT 5 DOLLARS. CONGRATS TO ALL LONGS. KEEP CRYING SHORTS.
Hope to see $4.50-$5 tomorrow!!
Stock would explode if insiders began buying.
Bought small position. Am I right - the future dividend is about 3% using today pps? $.19 per share?
"For those thinking so, this company will never go belly up. Have you seen the institutional ownership of this co.? Some of the countries biggest. They own 90% of it. 1.5% is owned buy insiders. You think they're going to lose their money? Not! They (and the government) will never let Gannett collapse. Once this virus is history, the stock will steadily and smoothly move right back up, esp as revenue increases. They'll even hire back their best employees they had to let go.Plus...The government will help them out with the loan situation. They'll get out of that ridiculous 11%+ loan they have now and refi it at a close to zero % interest rate. That alone will save tens of millions. The stock being this low is a gift. Buy now! Increase your position. It's @ $1.46 right now. You'll make even more money in the end. And don't expect much talk from management. What can they say that they did say yesterday in the layoff letter? They'll talk in may on the conference call. As for now, sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. The sick feelings you have now will turn to great joy when this stock is up into the teens and 20s and you're collecting huge dividend payments. Especially if you don't let this huge buying opportunity pass you bye. So add to your position people! I just did!"
Onward to $6 and above. Let's go!
"Advertising already priced in? Pray tell how do you price in advertising during a once in a lifetime worldwide pandemic? And during a volatile local, state and national election year? If billions are going to be spent as expected, the nation's largest newspaper and online news chain is certainly going to get its share. Gannett."
"Improvement in the number of ads in your local daily newspaper can give you some idea of what's going on with Gannett. What I am seeing in the company-owned paper I subscribe to is more of it. Auto dealer ads are returning slowly but surely. Most pages in the first section are two-thirds full with the exception, of course, ad-free opinion pages. Sports pages have practically no ads. Large spending advertisers in my paper are medically related (hospitals, pharma, medical practices, hearing aids etc). A steady source of ads come from supermarkets, national advertisers, obituaries, realtors and legal ads. Classified ads are unchanged. Only a few weeks ago I page through the paper seeing very few ads. Looking much better now."
"Stock should be going UP on earnings report. I think the 13% drop in top line spooked the stock but I think this is the wrong way to look at it. We knew the print number would be down 15%. Their digital number was very solid. The company is trimming debt, creating synergies and selling off unneeded real estate. I think this is a ""right-size"" turn around story and I think the stock should be bought aggressively at these levels.Moreover the loss is entirely attributable to Depreciation and Goodwill impairment. Cash flow wise they are doing good in a difficult environment. Remember things like school sports draws big viewership. There are no school sports."
"My math seems to indicate they can easily pay off their 1.7 billion dollar debt if trends continue. If anyone sees a mistake in my work, PLEASE correct me. They had 200 million dollars of cash on hand going into the quarter. They ended the quarter with 160 million cash on hand. A 125 million dollar interest payment was due in q2, which would have put them at 75 million of cash on hand instead of 160 million. So they were able to add 85 million of cash on hand this quarter. NOW, their quarterly interest payment going into the future is 50 million. So if we subtract 85 million by 50 million, we get 35 million. So we can assume that if trends continue, gannett will add 35 million of cash on hand every quarter.HOWEVER, If we subtract the one time abnormal interest payment of 125 million by the regular interest payment of 50 million, we would get 75 million. This is an additional 75 million of cash on hand being generated each quarter to add to the other 35 million we calculated. So there is AT LEAST 110 million dollars of cash on hand being added every quarter. If this trend holds up, the company would generate over 2 billion of the 1.7 billion it needs to pay off its loan in five years.This isn’t taking real estate sales, corona virus recovery, or a refinanced loan deal into account.If I did any of the math wrong, please someone correct me so I can see my errors."
Healthy pull back after a 100% jump.This is the set up for the nextJump to $5. Perfect time to get in more. I added 1k more shares 
Snapchat is the first major company to find value in Gannett’s local marketing footprint. More to come. This stock is going to blow up this year.
"Absolutely crushed it across the board. Profit, pay down debt, rapid growth in digital."
"Not only does Gannett own 246 DAILY newspapers in 43 states, the company owns more than 1,000 weeklies. All cash cows since ads are paid for in advance."
"been looking for an entry point in this stock, but watching go down day in and out.... What's happening?"
this stock is too cheap.. It should be $12..
Finally big refinancing! Ready to pop. Back to $10+ in 2021!
"Is it messed up that I still want to buy more shares even though I have a ton already? The more DD I do it just doesnt make sense. $1.50 for the largest media company? Between the merger, elections coming up, and a vaccine right around the corner... people keep talking of its debt but the debt was on purpose!! They did a merger. Not like they didnt know they werent gonna have this debt.. thoughts?"
"Today I saw in the ""coffee grounds"" - a little more and it will be 6 USD. Then a small correction to 5.5 and then a re-raise in Q3. That's how you think??"
"If or when this stock could reach $4 or $5 has anybody out there decided too load the boat with shares and making a real score?? If Cooperman were to start buying more I'assuredly buy every share I could, it seems like it'll make it, and the 120,000 share insider purchase makes me feel if something good is going on"
"moving up a little every week, $2+ in Dec."
Down 13cents from the day before EC. Hope all y'all longs were smart enough to cash in your chips during the sugar high.
"Billions will be spent on political advertising at local, state, and national levels. And who owns the most newspaper print and online publications? Gannett covers the nation, with 246 publications in every state and most major markets."
buy the dip - this company's digital business is a winner
Gannett is up 15.36% to 3.23
"“The new Term Loan B will save us 375 basis points in annual interest, which is expected to result in approximately $90 million in cash interest savings in 2021 before the benefit of our expected asset sales further reducing debt.”"
in this market it's a near term 2X. if you wanna hold and see the long strategy out its a 5X in 1 year. the price is so cheap for the saturation and impact they have across literally every market in America. And the short interest on available liquidity is getting uncertain to say the least. this is a fun cycle in the market that I've only seen a few times. enjoy.
Revenue down $72 million and right now the stock is down less than 1%.Happily placing a short bet on Monday.Have a great weekend!
"heavy volume yesterday, nice to see big guys buying again, over $7 in the next month"
"think about GCI this way,LEON COOPERMAN achieved a record 119%return on managing his $$ money last year, and he's the largest shareholder and a good friend of REEDS , STARTING BUYING SIZE in number of shares yesterday, this will become a $28 STOCK OR A EVEN larger m&a deal"
"“ Gannett Co. provided a fourth-quarter revenue outlook that was above expectations, amid strength in advertising. The media company expects revenue of $865 million to $875 million, up from $699.3 million a year ago.”"
One thing that impresses me with GCI stock is that the volume is so low. It is clear that the stock is in strong hands and shareholders are committed to the turnaround story. With that said the low volume makes it difficult for institutions to acquire shares. If I ran a large Mutual Fund or institution it would be a time consuming task to build up a position. Perhaps this is why the stock is trending higher. There are institutions accumulating positions.
"Your corrupt socialist government told the FAA to prohibit drone flights from spying on its illegal alien processing facility under a bridge in Texas. Gannett, why are you ignoring this? Do you have no shame? Have any of your far left staff writers, or execs been to a socialist/communist country to know how they will be living if this continues? China, Cuba, Venezuela, Russia? Is that what they/you want?"
"Miller Value Partners, in their recent investment letter, said this about GCI:There is the potential of $300M of synergies through consolidation of facilities, centralizing operations, expansion of technology systems, and selling non-core assets. We see normalized EBITDA in excess of $700M and annual free cash flow that could approach $500M over the next couple of years, greater than the company market capitalization at year-end. Gannett’s CEO has significant incentive to deliver on long-term merger targets and reduce debt to the benefit of shareholders. The CEO recently received a new contract that will award him 2M shares if the share price is greater than $10 by the end of 2023. We believe a successful transformation of Gannett over the next couple of years is worth in excess of $20/share."""
So what is the dividend going to be after the Gannett purchase? What is the investing thesis here? Anyone have a clue??
Sold 6.95 probably where I bought it two years ago so technically a (opportunity) loss.
"Just had a chance to review the quarterly results. I have been long prior to GCI acquisition. I am particularly very please with the tremendous Balance Sheet improvement. Management has done an excellent job in streamlining the company, reducing debt, while managing to grow revenues. Today is the day whereby it safe to say that GCI is no longer a sinking ship."
company is going to beat market with digital revenue this year.
Big bounce back soon
it's a winner. digital ad segment will drive growth and increase value
t should start rising tomorrow and into next week ahead of investor conferences jan8..lets see.
I'm out..$6.60..take me as a contrary indicator or not..this is a problem stock and I dont see anyone coming to squeeze the shorts..
Something is bringing in the buyers.
Good news today as Citi upgraded NEWM to buy with price target of $14/share. GLTA
"“One of my favorite names right now is Gannett, which is at $3. Newspapers are going away. But if it works, it’ll be $25.”-Bill Miller"

"Insider buying Coming, Company update, and Short selling flows: Company update: The company made 60mm of synergy savings of the 2020 150mm and 300mm 2021 guidance. So 60 of 150 in q1 is better than expected hitting 40 percent in first quarter needed for year 1. They guided to q1 EBITA better than q4 and takes the leverage ratio lower than 3.6x debt/ebitda to 3.55x moving further from the under 3.75x bank loan trigger for dividend. They guided to pay the .19 dividend May and keep paying it. Now at 18.6% The 140+mm q4 EBITDA is enormous compared to the now 500+mm marketcap. Guided free cashflow on track and this should be 50mm in q1 on track for 200mm operating fcf in ‘20, 300m in ’21 needed to take 1.75bb debt to 1.1bb in 2 years. At 4/sh this now is 40% FCF yield and this is the cornerstone of why this is the cheapest opportunities anywhere. There just are not 30% or even 40% FCF yields anywhere in any equities. The numbers were very good and guidance for q1 even better. Expect more real estate sales to pay down debt in q1. Shorting: at 25mm shorted shares and 22.5x short interest ratio, lower volume and price bouncing btwn $6 and $7 for 2.5 months was becoming an issue for the large short base that built post merger news. Looking at finra data, the 200k a day went to 600k to 700k for four days ahead of earnings and cracked down price from 6.40 to 4.89 before even seeing earnings news. Then 1.7mm, 1.9, 1.3, and 1.4mm shorting per days after earnings. So shorts sold into bad sentiment w/Virus using tactic that usually makes longs sit waiting to see earnings before buying. So shorts pushed a lot setting up new opportunity to enter. Insider buying: Am expecting a flurry of insider buying with outside money in the coming days. The 10k got filed Monday night, and insiders need to wait 2 days before buying after 10k. So Thursday is first day for insiders to buy. Expect to see Thursday to Monday with flurry of insider buys from CEO, operating business line presidents, and maybe large partner/manager Fortress. These insider buys are going to instill some confidence that was eroded by the price collapse caused by the shorting, overall market decline, and virus and make the shorts question this 22.5x short interest ratio that could make covering very uncomfortable considering some very large institutions are not going to sell for 1+ year and let the merger they voted “yes” on have at least a year to play out. We sold a little of the millions of shares of Genworth that we previously posted on at over 50% gains, and added more Gannett after earnings which seems absurdly cheap. We are expecting over 10/share by year end after these easy management targets are hit and the leverage comes down, then over 15/share through 2021"
Massive buying coming into Gannett -- something big is in the works!
160 million cash on hand in the bank that can pay off those interests that you guys talking about! It’s from the balance sheet! They also got almost 770 million in current assets and 700m in current liabilities so they are good! And solid! This company stock should be at least 5$ way undervalued and it’s gonna shoot up to 4&5 just give it time!
Today's trading in GCI fully illustrates the potential beneficial impact on the stock price of availability of an approved vaccine or an approved antiviral for COVID-19. I think today's move is primarily due to the announcement of the FDA approval for the plasma treatment. Just imagine what an approved antiviral could do the this stock price.
$2.75 before Dec. 15Th
Wish we rocket up like Gamestop. lol
"Bought this at $0.72 and sold it at $0.95. I'll buy it again at $0.72 and here is why:- $4 billion in assets with nearly $2 billion in Goodwill. Wow! Half of the value is Goodwill??? They need to STOP buying dying newspapers way above their value.- $1.9 billion in debt - a large chunk of that is over 10% interest (think I read it was 12%???)- So between Goodwill and Debt is equal to its total assets. Ouch!- $779 million in ""current assets"" - $745 million went to pay off the debt in 2019! How are you ever expected to make a profit - it's like a credit card and they are paying off just above the minimum - People are not paying for monthly digital subscriptions at the rate they need - too many ""free"" online newspapers. Yes, you can trade this stock, but be careful eventually it will sink to $0. You are better off investing in the company that owns the Gatehouse debt, not Gatehouse."
The future of fake news. . . GCI: Looking for fiction writers with wild malleable imaginations.
"I dare GCI to—for a change—publish an ENTIRE REPORT (the AZ audit report) to LET YOUR READERS DECIDE—instead of allowing your hack “reporters” parse, cover up, distort and spin the UNREVEALED INFORMATION. Gannett’s motto? Generalize, Conceal and Ignore. . ."
GCI needs to announce the dividend and how safe it is because it’s a major concern. Any news would be very beneficial.
"Over the last week I bought 80,000 share of GCI. Going long in to earnings in the coming quarters."
Exciting revenue increasing in foreseeable future for GCI. GCI will benefit as well as savvy investors in the coming months!
Gannett is down 6.57% to 4.66
"Does anyone have a crystal ball on today's substantial up move in the GCI price? I just wonder if the new Federal aid package being debated in Congress might include some form of assistance for newspapers. If some kind of assistance is eventually included for newspapers (e.g., loan-rate assistance) then GCI stock price could turn into a ROCKET!"
Need help: Say if my cost avg on this is 10 bucks what is my % divi now?
"1. USA TodayUSA Today is a national American daily middle-market newspaper published by the Gannett Company. It was founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982.

"The stock is slowly and persistently moving higher on low volume. It tells me that there is a strong shareholder base. As the stock crosses over the 5.00 mark I suspect we will begin to see more institutional ownership. The company is doing an OUTSTANDING job at aligning their expenses to their revenue. Paper newspapers are in negative growth, however NYT, Washington Post and WSJ have proven that a Newspaper company can be profitable with a strong digital offering.IMO there is no replacement for local newspapers. People want school sports, local news, town politics and obits to name a few. GCI has a priceless collection of newspaper properties. With the democrats desire to ""save the local paper"" I feel that this combined with the companies prudent fiscal management creates a very timely long term holding. The rumors of GCI death has been greatly exaggerated."

"Every comment I read is speculative. No real news until ER. Remember, the merger created over $300M in savings, also known as profit. Cool heads will prevail."
Can’t wait for earnings report this week.
"Buying more. Easily a 6-7 stock, especially when they bring back the dividend"
Breaking resistance.
"Why is the price of this stock so low?It seems like someone automatically adjusts the stock price to a low level with a small quantity of about 100 shares consecutively, what do you think?Is someone trying to keep the price down and get the supplies?I can't figure out why it's falling like this.Please give me your opinion."
"I was looking at the 10-Q and the financial and it seems that GCI newspaper business is declining 10% per year, their digital business is growing nicely. Management has temporarily suspended the dividend (which is likely going to be permanent), They plan to selloff real estate and reduce their debt, while creating significant operating synergies from the merger.Point being that there are some definite positives including positive cash flow, significant synergies that could buoy earnings, and potential debt restructuring. If management can navigate the declining newspaper revenue while slashing costs there could be tremendous upside potential. I have averaged down once and am considering averaging down again. I don't think the company is in danger of going BK any time soon and I think local news media will never be extinct. People will always want obit, school sports and local news. It is imperative that GCI drives traffic to their digital platform more aggressively. That is the future of local news."
"Hopefully, one analyst who listened to the call will give a thumbs up to Gannett. Big wish, since many of them are linked to Gannett competition."
Their next quarterly dividend should be announced any day. Hopefully management realizes the only way SP goes higher is because of their dividend and it’s coverage. They appear to be managing the merger well and taking advantage of opportunities to cut costs . GLTA
GCI stock will explode to the upside towards the end of the year!
Look at bright side shorties... no matter how bad ur day is goin... YOURE NOT ANDREW CUOMO... therez that
"One of the points here everyone seem to miss is that NEWM is a REIT. Yeah as the print business subsides, they don't need the property the newspapers needed. It took a great deal of space to store newsprint, print and distribute the papers. And the reporters don't need diskspace. The all have tablets and smartphones so they operate from anywhere. The old newpapers were built at the beginning of the 20th century or before. That's all center city prime commercial property that in plenty of instances is being re-gentrified and leased. With all the government federal state and local incentives to bring in jobs the center cities are better looking economic opportunities. Don't forget that NEWM was spun out of Newcastle Investment Corp. A REIT. They'll get this debt ground down faster than you may think. They'll either lease or sell the office space that came with the Gannett purchase. GLTU, Bob S."
"""March was our best month of the quarter and we anticipate continued improvement in Q2 "" ""we expect to show yoy total rev growth in 2ND quarter along with 30% ebitda growth"", Revenue decreased due to structural changes we made over the last year."
"It's time for Reed and his Wall Street buddies to start buying, as current shareholders will be voting NO on any proxy requests, Reed should at least be buying shares ,so that as shares move up he can use higher price as a currency. Should be $3.00 per share as a no brainer. Plus a new bunch of directors needed, maybe VIAC does M&A deal"
"The debt reduction in 2021 alone should lead to an increase in equity value of 3$ per share and in case the valuation metrics will adjust to peers, 14$ will be added to share price"
"I subscribe to one Gannett daily and once a week pick up copies of two others at my Florida Publix to check out the amount of display ads in each. Lately, I've noticed a steady increase in ads, with an increase in for real estate, auto dealer (forced to advertise due to declining auto sales), classifieds (mainly due to the paid obit memorials), home improvement, and medically related ads. Compared to two months ago, I would estimate the number of ads in the three papers have doubled. Definitely good for Gannett's 3rd quarter bottom line. FYI"
"Gannett’s has many great newspapers that have been around for ages, those will be updated and available digitally. Great assets which will be recognized as the world returns to normal. 6.00 is in sight now."
Can someone check on Bee right now? He had a panic attack when the stock rose 1% when it was at $5. I can only imagine how he’s feeling right now.
"another way to look at GCI, when 55% of the current work force works from home : what will they read to relax ""News Papers"". ie GCI 300 papers and #1USA today $2 next week $3 before sept 15th buying every share I can"
just got in with another 15k at 1.39 now fingers crossed
up one day down the next. pretty annoying day trade games. Lets hope the Bill Miller stake and others stabilize this stock....or is it another Leon Cooperman pump up? I am sitting on this since $6.17 and still looking for $10 by year end. $25 seems a bit over optimistic.
"How far up do you think the stock will skyrocket on the day the bill passes and gets non-stop coverage on Bloomberg, CNBC, WSJ, Marketwatch, etc.Read the bill here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7640See video on how the bill got it's start here: https://youtu.be/TV1A27I936EGCI Shareholders do your part: Share theses links all over your social media and send it to reporters that you know. Once the bill passes this stock could go up 8-10x in one day. But even news of such a bill just being introduced will be enough alone to give this stock a 3-4x boost.Mark My words: as soon as this congressional bill is even MENTIONED on Yahoo Finance..........We're going to 8 dollars on that day. By the time the bill fully passes, we could soar to $16.I know I am doing my part as a motivated GCI Shareholder, do your part as well.

Great digital growth in q4
Pain will be over soon with the merger closing tomorrow. GCI-NEWM consolidation is good for the industry. This will be back to 8s by year end.
Huge refinancing of debt just announced. Creates almost $100M in more cash flow not including RE asset sales. Debt repayment never looked better!
why is this going down?
"The hedge fund’s newspaper business, Digital First Media, is bidding to buy Gannett, operator of the nation’s largest chain of daily newspapers by circulation, including USA Today — as well as its $900 million in remaining property and equipment — for more than $1.3 billion."
Full page auto dealer ads are returning to my local Gannett papers in Florida. Dealers are one of the best and usually one of the most dependable sources. Advertising will increase as businesses adjust to. covid19.

"@Hello I am an institutional investor and own over 1mm GCi shares and had added 225k shares the other day and bought 170k shares today. In the week before Xmas I bought 800k shares at 6.25 so there is a seller in the market and am happy to take the other side. We made a successful play on Genworth and bought several million shares of GNW equity in the lower 3’s price and also bought 10mm of gnw 6.5 bonds at 76 that gappped up to 90’s. We predicted the sale of Genworth Canada and the rapid delevering that helped to shore up GNW price with or without a sale of GNW to China Oceanwide. Here , GCI is a similar story. Enormous cashflow and predicted rapid de-levering in 24 months. Free cashflow in 2020 at 200mm and at 300mm in 2021 There is 100-150mm of real estate and other assets to sell. This is 650-700mm of cash that will pay down the 1.7bb Apollo term loan in 24 months to 1.1bb and allow a refi a gar lower rate like l+500 saving 50mm/year on debt service after the refi. This is worth over 12 -14 now and if the EBItDA comes in at 500-600mm in a couple years this is a 20h stock. The market has this wrong. This is a safe trade from here with 4bb revenue, enormous free cashflows, management guidance at very strong ebitda, and trading at 35-40 percent of book. The ceo is buying with his own money and from what I can tell is an honest guy and very convicted in his ability to create value. There are investors that don’t understand this business that got cash and stock and are now selling and shorting is also a factor. This will turn and subside. Management will come out and show confidence in paying the dividend for the entire year and maybe discuss future years. The dividend is secure and the CEO went to great lengths to discuss how the dividend payment would go from 30 percent or free cashflow to under 20 percent into the future in his transcript at the Citibank conference in Vegas that can be viewed or listened to at the Gannett investor relations website. Read my past posts on GNW by double clicking BIG G name to see our posts and advice regarding GNW successful analysis. We will continue to buy GCI as opportunities like this do not come along very often with such a high free cashflow yield."
Some of those GME dollars are finding their way into GCI.
Market Edge changed its sell rating to long per this earnings report... thats always a good sign
"nice to see over 3.3 million shares traded yesterday, mostly on buy side, political adds for the next year will push GCI over $10 per share with large rev. increases"
"I think Leon Cooperman has lost his touch , why is he letting the ship sink . Should by the remaining shares and take this think private ."
"FED will buy corp. debt, mean s GCI has a backup if needed. This mgmt. has the opportunity to buy somebody that is very profitable. I bot a bundle today ,will keep buying into the $3.50 area We''ll know for sure when volume reaches a day or 2 of 1o million shares"
"Clear liquidity with real estate sales and balance sheet. Lots of strong revenue gains upcoming with campaign spend and digital growth. Took a fall due to dividend cut, but this is a $4-5 target. Well below 52 week high of $11."
"Company should be announcing dividends in next 10 days I think new rate will be around 18 cents per quarterAt 9 % yield, stock can rise to around $8 after the dividends announcement"
"just maybe getting ready, a big volume on upside needed, after 40 years on wall street,as trader ,investment banker, hedge fund operator, anyway, still love to find the ""Maybe's'"

"Guesses on tomorrow? Any thoughts on downward afterhour??My guess... $1.80 by end of day, $2 by end of friday"
HYPOCRISY ALERT: It’s laughable to see Gannett’s AZ Republic and Dems going out of their way to tar and feather a Republican Governor (which I think may be justified) while totally ignoring the Donkey/Jackass in the room—a demented President who clearly has his hand in his son’s cookie jar. I’d call that “Hermit Crab Justice”—where one arm of the law is much longer than the other.
I bought more shares. It appears some consolidating as well as slight market down draft has lowered price of stock. I think this offers good risk/reward for the future. Time will tell. JMO GTLA
"It's funny to read coverage from financial rags focusing on the acquisition and consolidation with Gannett, suggesting that the stock price has anything to do with shareholder sentiment. This is not a real market. It's a playground. The only logical way to play this is to either short it or ride the short's coattails. A nice bit of news would go a long way, but I'm guessing the news story is already behind this."
I have owned this stock for many years from the spin-off from Newcastle to New Media. I added substantial shares this morning as I think this is ready to explode. It is cheap if/when the economy rebounds. Time will tell. JMO GLTA
Very solid earnings on track with solid liquidity digital growth and debt repayment
Might have been a bit late on this move but I'm in at 1.48 expecting at least 50% return in two months. Good luck everybody!
GCI over the top management significantly reducing interest rate on debt bodes well for the bottom lineand stock appreciation.
A progressive news organization would be more concerned about killing trees needlessly. Does anyone really read USA Today inserts? Everyone I know throws them in the trash with the grocery ad wrapper as soon as it leaves the red plastic bag. . .
Does anybody know the driver behind the timing of this increase on Friday. They seem to be struggling with all the debt and interest payments lining up and business being hard hit from corona situation. Just can’t understand why do we see such a big jump without any positive news or am I missing something here? I live outside of USA so not sure if there is a locally visible phenomenon which I can’t see from Europe? Thanks for your insights
"Gannett ended furloughs for many reporters, citing, “rays of light in our financial performance”"
"The new debt conversion price, in case it's needed, is at 5.00. That sounds like the debt holders value the stock at 5.00. The initial conversion rate is 200 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (which is equal to a conversion price of $5.00 per share of Common Stock (the ""Conversion Price""), representing a conversion premium of approximately 187% based on the closing price of $1.74 per share of Common Stock on November 16, 2020)."
Time to give back the Dividend GCI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I have 5.000 GCI stocks at 0.75 and will continue to add on until I reach 20k. Once management refinances the Apollo loan in 2021, the stock will fly to 10$ and beyond"
"Massive earnings beat to a 15 million dollar profit. 40% digital subscription growth, with digital revenue making 33% of all revenue and growing fast. Can’t wait for call."
"I'm optimistic, because Insider Transactions early March 2020 are valued over 700k USD. The last time it was soo high was years ago. Of course, from todays view buying for 3 USD looks kind of a bad decision, but I guess nobody would see this distress coming up. With 150 M USD in cash; i don't see Chapter-11 coming soon. Business will re-start in about 4 to 8 weeks, so just a few weeks to bypass"
"In addition to the insider buying, Leon Cooperman, just took a large position. Both in addition to significant institutional ownership."
I think the stock will be over $ 6 by the end of August
"The last two quarters should be good for Gannett: heavy political advertising spending at local, state and national levels, and back to school and holiday spending = increased advertising spending."

"I have some comfort in the announcement of a new CFO. I doubt he would have joined only to take the company into Chapter 11. Plus he appears to have strong acquisition integration credentials, which is critical for GCI. I expect he'll be an improvement over Engel, whom I found unimpressive."
"GCI update: Price action falls back to area where adding shares is extremely attractive. Added 150k shares yesterday and 150k shares today. Now over 1.55mm shares position. Knowing Michael Reed added 2+mm of outside funds at 6.60 continues to be a vote of valuation. CEO Reed is is a straight shooter from what I can glean so far with my interactions. I respect and know other holders of GCI. The news of LEE purchase of the Berkshire assets creates a trade metric in the market that makes the current value of GCI seem considerably more attractive. The Berkshire business has 40-50mm of ebitda and now 550mm if debt. In less than 2 years GCI will have 500mm in ebitda and will be paying down 600mm of the term loan. The Lee deal will be lucky to pay down 20mm a year of debt or 5 percent vs the GCI entity now will pay down 200mm in 2020 and 300mm in 2021: plus 100mm of real estate sales - the 1.75bb if Applllo loan will go to 1.15bb in 2 years. Plus the Berkshire deal forbids Lee from selling any real estate business lines, they would not not be trading at .35 to .40x book and if valued as a digital /tech business would be at a multiple of book. The Berkshire/Lee deal makes GCI seem to be worth double the 6h /share now. The GCI shareholders that got 6/cash and 6.30 new shares are selling now not sure what they even have as happens frequently after mergers setting up the acquisition opportunity."
Listen to Bill Miller:https://millervalue.com/deep-value-strategy-1q21-letter/500% or more sounds good to me
Good News for GCI! Inflation has caused staplers to increase in value!

Fellow longs: What do you think are the chances that Gannett will be able to refinance its $1.8 Billion loan that has an interest of 11.5%? I sure wonder if they are working on a possible refinance given the current extremely low interest environment.
"I've resubscribed to my Gannett newspaper after months of occasionally picking up $2.50 copies at convenience stores. I must admit Gannett has made the Daytona Beach News Journal a much better read than it was before the pandemic. 1. Improved local coverage 2. Interesting features from other Gannett papers 3. Obituaries have been moved out of the classifieds and now feature both black and white and color photos, larger print and, seriously, the obits are more detailed and make interesting reading (six pages Sunday) 4. The greatest improvement is in the sports section, with several pages of local, regional and national sports, regardless of advertising content. Coverage of the Jaguars has been expanfed, including stories from the Jax Florida Times Union of the USA TODAY NETWORK. As a lifelong (77 yrs) newspaper reader, I would give Gannett a solid four stars out of five for making the Daytona Beach News Journal a much better read. If these improvements are being in other company papers and online, it bodes well for the company's future."
somebody said enough already!!..back to $6 on 2.3M shares....c'mon now..I mean you know they had to dunk it under $6...now comes the short push...the same shorts knowing full well the downside is getting harder to push..watch more money come into this if it closes above $6
"Gannett's 1,000-plus weekly newspapers could represent a gold mine of opportunities, even more than its 260 dailies. Many serve underserved local communities by providing local news content (births, deaths, weddings, graduations, local school sports, elections, classifieds, etc). Digitalizing these papers would offer small communities 24-hr local news and advertising opportunities at lower cost to Gannett."
Waiting for another attempt to climb up to the $6 price level again. Are we expecting any good news or positive updates anytime soon? Any events coming up? Anyone know?
Oh man. The 40% digital subscription growth is all local. It doesn’t even factor in USA Today members from that new service.
DIRECTORS buying shares will change shareholder opinion and the shares will quickly start moving up
Any news out there today. Why the drop ?

"GCI: We are adding shares ever day for last five days and have bought almost 1mm GCI shares in five sessions adding onto about 100k shares bought in October in 8h. We are expecting a strong rebound in shares bright about by new company disclosures that we expect to come January ahead of ceo Reed speaking at industry events. These new disclosures we expect will address such things as a.) committed to paying the generous .19 cent dividend to investors into the future B.) guidance for ebitda for 2020 c.). New info on efforts to drive more revenue through digital channels. If even part of the synergies of this merger are realized GCI is set up to earn substantial profits into 2020,2021, and 2022. Ceo Reed buys 285k shares at 6.61 recently only to see the share price go down further setting up attractive entry. We are expecting the SP to rebound into the 9h again into the first quarter as more street firms pick up coverage (only one firm listed on Bloomberg coverage universe) and opine on the value. Tax loss selling in full swing also setting up opportunity. GCI is our new high conviction idea after doing quite well on our Genworth equity and bond investment we shared considerable details on this board predicting GNW would sell their Canada division."
"I'm in today. this stock generates a ton of cash revenue and cobid will allow them to trim further. they can handle their debt at current levels and aren't going bankrupt anytime soon. it is ripe for volatiltiy bringing on a short squeeze and the. imagine if all this ""crazy news"" going on actually gives them a big surprise in this quarter. this stock could triple on earnings."
lets see if it can hold $5 tomorrow. If it does then I feel pretty good still.
"The stock of a company that owns 260 daily newspapers, including the most widely circulated (USA TODAY, 1.6 million) closed Friday at 1.43, while The New York Times (daily circ about 500k) is trading in low 40s). Strange but true."
Bought more shares today. Company is in a much better financial position than the last time they issued a dividend. I imagine that it will come back within this year or next. Stock is ready to fly.
My patience is starting to run thin with this stock!!! Not a huge position but was looking for more than this! I will give in another quarter or two. Div reinstated situation?
"Big G: Gannett continues to represent the most compelling ideas of 2020. It is so unusual to find this free cashflow yield of 26% for 2020 and almost 40% for 2021 at the 200mm and 300mm free cashflow. The enormous discount to book at .35 makes this especially attractive after the price decline following the merger tie up. Big G bought shares in the final 10 minutes of the day adding to the position. The upcoming earnings call next week will give Michael Reed the opportunity to pledge how sacred the dividend will be over several years, paint a picture of synergy savings, growing ebitda, and debt paydown that he expects in the next two years. I also expect to hear him say more real estate has been sold and more term loan payments are in the works. He will go to lengths to discuss the digital presence in subscriptions as well as the growing digital advertising subsidiaries Reachlocal and Wordstream - these growing businesses can offset the decline in print advertising over the coming years and backfill those revenues. He will discuss the enormous footprint touching now some 150mm views for free digital USA Today, digital subscriber , small business services, and national and local print. There is no one that is drinking the koolaide more than Michael Reed and he is proud to have put over 2mm of outside money at 6.60 several months ago. He thinks in two to three years the price is into the 20’s based on his ebitda forcast and debt paydowns. Fortress remains an excellent partner and major shareholder very bullish on future prospects and was behind the merger. Gannett’s large scale is a significant advantage to extract revenues from the 150mm touch points - like I mentioned before if this was a tech company or a tech advertising company this would trade as a multiple of revenues - don’t be surprised if a couple years down the road a large social media or tech giant buys a firm like gannet to get the one thing they might need which is content coupled with the page views. USA Today gives away free content now on the mobile app but this might not always be the case into the future. The large 150mm footprint is valuable, the free cashflows are valuable, and the ebitda growth over years is valuable. The merger adds value yet the trading price makes either New Media or Gannett valued at zero which doesn’t make sense. There was an all cash bid at 12/share for Gannet but Fortress and Michael Reed convinced the Gannett board to do the deal with them. The value is still there looking at the two companies separate yet like is argued there is significant cost savings, real estate to sell, synergy, and opportunity to ramp digital faster together. Anything under 7 is a very good entry point for this long term investment."
Their are 279 institutions holding shares. 5 % held by insiders. This is not a penny stock.
A whopping 1 million shares traded in first 30 mins.
This refinancing deal explains all the insider buying happening the last few months. The shorts on this board tried to have us believe the insiders buying meant nothing. They should have bought with us instead of shorting!

https://investors.gannett.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14634301Will this dilute our number of shares?
Can shorties try harder to push this down again? I like being able to buy in at near $5 price.
With the merger acreative to earnings and additional support for a sustainable very substantial dividend.A great future.

Looks like GCI is ready to make it's assault on resistance level at $6.52.
I added shares as this seems to be basing for another up trend. I will sell most of these shares at higher prices when that occurs. I have owned a position in this stock for years and the price decline was painful but looks over done. There seems to be a lot of interest in the stock when you look at volume Friday and today. Time will tell. JMO GLTA
bought the dip :) thx
@Hello I called $1 share price by August and you had some snide comments. I sold at $2.80 range if I recall and suggested I would buy in at $1. You must really like the color red. Maybe next time you won't be so quick to criticize.

Hallelujah !!!!!! Finally!! Now lets see if it can hold the line longs.---- and no need to reply BeeSay!!!
where is this stock in a year? I spun the wheel on this one but the lack of positive movement is not encouraging. I am in at $6.17 Did Leon Cooperman sell out? Patience isnt one of my virtues.
