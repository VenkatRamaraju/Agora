"CEO wasn’t on, the President took precedent in the coverage"
Free to play with bagholders
Gandler is one of the more well spoken CEOs
"Shorts, time for your group therapy."
"Yep, AH going up! Market saw what I saw. This is one confident CEO who knows that FUBO is a future gold mine. I liken it to origins of NFLX ... but greater potential base due to gaming and betting platforms, with broad use of data and interaction with the viewer. I don't think people even know how awesome this could potentially be. But the CEO definitely has a vision! It's def going over $30 tomorrow. May hit post-earnings high of around $33 before end of week"
Lot of shorts are irritable today
You know it's big when they make you wait
The sleeping giant is about to awaken. Online sports wager is going to be a huge revenue boost. Will be announcing more approvals with states that have legalized gambling and partnerships in the gaming arena. Continue to hold. FUBO is a winner near and long-term.
shorts better cover!!! I would not want to be short here 
Looking to take a investment/position in Fubo. Been on the sidelines waiting to pull the trigger. In my opinion there will be significant profit taking which by the way is normal. I strongly believe based on my due diligence this company Fubo will change many peoples lifestyles and they will Indeed be in the Life Changing Monies. One thing I have learned over the years is that Buying and Holding always Prevails. Also Patience is key. Hopefully sooner rather than later I take a Position. Congrats to all the Die Hard True Longs the Best is yet to come. Stay the course and never follow the herd. Best Dave
"The shorts are getting desperate, squeeze city coming"
30 today?
"It has pivoted from 25 and good news keep coming out every couple of days, with 1,000,000 subscribers predicted by the end of the year and live betting coming in 3 months!"
Huge volume already
"I believe that Fubo will take off in the fall. Now people are on much needed vacations, Once the fall comes , more people will be into tv again. This is the only stock, that I own , that I will not consider selling"
"and it's only a 2%+ move, this is just the start!"
"Remember, don't have fear like Alex is trying to create. This is one PRETTY stock."
It’s exactly what they want to scare people to get the stock lower cause they’re shorts! Don’t panic sell!
"The Arizona Department of Gaming announced 18 of the 20 available licenses for AZ sportsbooks despite a potentially delayed launch.The regulator announced 10 tribal licensees and eight professional sports licensees.Sports betting in Arizona is scheduled to launch Sept. 9, the same night the NFL season begins.That might not be the case if either of the two lawsuits filed against the ADG lead to a temporary injunction, of course. An ADG spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuits when contacted by LSR.What AZ sportsbooks will launch?While the ADG announced 18 license winners, only 15 AZ sportsbooks partners are known:Bally Bet: WNBA‘s Phoenix Mercury.Barstool Sportsbook: Phoenix Raceway.BetFred: Ft. McDowell Yavapai Nation.BetMGM: NFL’s Arizona Cardinals. Notably, fellow BetMGM partner Gila River did not receive a license.BetRivers: Indoor Football League’s Arizona Rattlers.Betway: San Juan Southern Palute Tribe.Caesars Sportsbook: MLB‘s Arizona Diamondbacks.DraftKings Sportsbook: TPC Scottsdale.FanDuel Sportsbook: NBA‘s Phoenix Suns.Fubo Gaming: Ak-Chin Indian Community.Golden Nugget: Hualapai Tribe.SuperBook: Fort Mojave Indian Tribe.TwinSpires: Tonto Apache Tribe.Unibet: Quechan Tribe.WynnBET: San Carlos Apache Tribe.Whatever sportsbooks are ready can begin signing up bettors on Saturday. That is the same day DFS contests launch in the state.Some brands still unknownFour license winners did not announce sportsbook partners by Friday:Navajo NationNHL‘s Arizona CoyotesTohono O’odham NationNotables missing from AZ sportsbooks announcedThree known partnerships did not make the cut:PointsBet is the biggest name to not receive a license. The brand partnered with the Yavapai-Apache Nation (not to be confused with the Yavapai-Prescott suing the ADG.)BlueBet missing out on a license is not shocking considering there were six more applicants than licenses available. The company partnered with the Colorado River Indian Tribes for a license but has no US operations or brand.MaximBet did not receive a license either. It partnered with the White Mountain Apache Tribe."
CEO on CNBC this afternoon - Power Hour @ 3 pm
If you listen to Ron
Arizona and now Iowa...Momentum...
"With all the upcoming gambling launches and associated marketing expense, share dilution is 100% going to happen. The question is, is it already priced in with the drop from $33 to $25 earlier this month when they announced the authorization to offer $500 mill. "
MACD crossed over!
"FuboTV offers Big10 Network, SEC Network, Pac12 Network ooooooooo yes!"
Train leaving the station choo choo. 3:10 to Yuma!
The fact that this is doing great in a terrible market is great!
Start expecting 2-3 states per month to allow the Fubo game plan for the remainder of this year. 2022 will be off the charts. Best ahead!
"That's unreal Raul, it's going to be an epic squeeze then! It's over for the shorts."
"In my opinion, once sports betting is implemented this stock will skyrocket."
CEO on CNBC soon.
Large profit forecast for Q3. About time.
Can we see $30 today?
I don't see shorts getting a breather at all this week!
"You have to have some vision to see why it is cheap. It’s cash balance is huge and minimal debt. Sports bettors aren’t particularly loyal to any book, so FUBO can steal away customers and this profits. FuboTV grew subscribers over the summer with their best seasonal months to come still."
Up even more in AH after his interview. The market is receiving it well. Big day tomorrow again!
FUBO a sleeping tiger.
"Trading right at high of the day, no one wants to sell! This is a great sign, sellers are out."
I wouldn't risk shorting this pup.
"This is absolutely huge: ""In the recent earnings call, management reiterated it remains on track to add sports wagering functionality to the platform by Q4, preceded in this quarter with the launch of an FTP (free-to-play) wagering app. This is a factor that should be taken into consideration."""
Typical end of the day dip but a great day! Buy the dip tomorrow!
I wouldn’t want to be short right now!!!
Who said it would never see $27 again?
$46.15 - still holding for $60+
"I don’t see $NFLX as much of a cord cutting solution as it doesn’t offer what cable does, but $FUBO does and more and for less monthly than the cable providers, this is what will get the moms and pops to switch to FuboTV."
The netflix of sports
Gandler is doing an amazing job.
Arizona just got approved! You know they’re about to make bank there!
$30 soon
Remember don’t panic and sell if it goes down a tiny bit. Remember 25 MILLION shorts have to pay in two days no matter what!
It's taking off...
The AZ agreement via The Ak-Chin Indian Community marks Fubo Gaming’s 5th market for its forthcoming @FuboSportsbook. Launch is on track for Q4 pending regulatory approvals in each market
Don’t be greedy don’t sell after a few cents! Make the millions of shorts pay for our stocks! They have to buy back in and this has been going up for 3 days now so they are going to get desperate and cave in!
"Half dollar gain mark, here we go..."
"$FUBO has unreal expansion potential, the subscriber base is the hardest to get and they are already at around 700k, it’s the new name in sports FuboTV."
Buy it before it goes above 30 because you will never see this stock in the 20s anymore!
Rondas vocabulary is “short” we know what he is
"Shorts, you should get out, two days ago."
"Starting September 2, fuboTV subscribers can seamlessly stream CONMEBOL matches, use FanView to monitor stats and scores next to and under a reduced-size video player and play free predictive games - all on one screen, using their remote control and without having to open another app. Both free games and FanView can be toggled on or off, letting consumers choose their live experience.fuboTV tested both features during the CONMEBOL match window in June. The integration of free games and FanView into the live soccer matches increased engagement - subscribers watched fuboTV for up to 37% more minutes (depending on platform) than those who did not engage."
Lot of shorts crying on here
"With 4K Smart TVs coming into the mainstream, FuboTV is going to only add more and more subscribers."
28 today for sure
"Shorts reek of desperation. Smart 4K TVs are starting to fly off the shelves as prices are just now down to reasonable levels, this will allow consumers to truly switch from the cord of Comcast and Directv to Fubo. IMO this is driving subscriber growth as well. Fubo’s Elite Plan offers all anyone would want. Comcast owns a piece of Fubo and is likely watching intently."
Finally Fubo broke out the resistance line! Now we are flying
Bullish EOD!
"8 weeks ago it went to 15, 4 weeks ago the lowest it went was 24 and now the shorts can't get it lower than 25 even with millions of shorts on here. Think about the potential for it next week! All the analysts put the value of this stock at 40. Plus all the shorts will have to cover in the next week or so! I wish I had more money to invest because I know this will recover. look at the chart it has always been above 25. This is a great buying opportunity!"
It will cross $100 by EOY
"I'm calling it a Week. It's been a rough week to say the least for Our Country and The World..... I will not get into this. However, for Those Effected My Sincere Thoughts are With You and Your Families. EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND!!Robbie"

Hope he will be on Cramer tonight.￼￼ ￼
"Wow SEC Network, Big Ten, PAC 12 all in the Elite plan with all the classic non-sports stations can you say college football? This is an unreal deal through $FUBO this isn’t something $NFLX offers. Comcast offers it at a much much higher price $CMCSA"

Ron Tom Alex
Hail Maximus!
FUBO time on CNBC?
"Excited about tomorrow, Bulls have control!"
green day!
are we ready for pump? git it now!
"May see $35 in a few months, FUBO takes time to be a well known company!"
CEO talking in 2 hours and shorts have 2 days to cover 
Double news today! Sportsbook coming by October 1.
recent earnings from FUBO and DDD were good which the stocks are still cheap. IMO
anyone know if you need fubo tv before you can online bet w them?
I have upgraded FUBO to strong buy. New price target is 30/share in 30 days.
Some forces never wanted it to be over $30 by today  Let’s see how it goes
Ron’s vocabulary is limited. So is his insight.
Plus 25 million shorts or people who are wishing the company does bad are here so there is a huge payout!
The hedgehogs are back hedge funds shorting are losing money! Boohoo
2 million shares in first 1/2 hour. Good sign.
Gandler coming up! Another mention!
This news is already accounted 3 times over at the current price Sell short at the open this is going to $22
So it’s raining today nothing to do so I’m going to be the anti Ron today.
I’ve lost so much money today trying to short Fubo. Should have never listened to Ron
"Heading into the last hour, some will likely accumulate further"
How long were the shorts working this stock over?
"It is just a start, Buy FUBO asap with good news and hold for sure !"
Single digit b4 30
Back to $26 easy short here
Reason why I sold most my $Roku back in February and bought $Fubo 18$ a share.Buy low sell high.Not a hard concept. Just takes patience.
Remember there are 25 million shorts don’t give them your stocks for cheap!
"Moving towards high of the day, bullish sign going on here."
The gambling portion will be huge.
Will short next week for easy 20% in and out Fubo Remember you can always buy it cheaper
"When the dam breaks on this one, it’s not going to stop for a while! So much great news lately."
Finally free to play has been announced letsss goooooo
$FUBO can grab customers from $CMCSA Comcast subscribers and from sports bettors at DraftKings $DKNG and also from $ROKU who are looking for a fuller solution.
Finally muted Ron I’m sick of hearing the same thing everyday. He is toxic. Long and strong. Fubo will be a money maker.
Beautiful slow move up today... Errone holding... About to pop
Already covered the FuboTV product yesterday on why and how it’s a value
I a have upgraded FUBO to strong buy. Price target 85/share in 1 year.
"Not that telling everyone to buy in this conversation thread will affect the stock price, but I really believe in this stock. If everyone believes in this and invests in it, it will go up. This is going to be the leading sports oriented streaming service as cable users continue to cut the cord. This will have a huge market share in the future and be worth hundreds of dollars. Long term this stock will be a beast. I’d go as far as to say this is the best stock to buy now in all of the market."
Estimates are to wipe out loss in 2022. That's huge. $300 stock easy.
News out!
29 and going higher!
"Red to green, here we go guys!"
"The last time ADX was this low was September last year, then FUBO proceeded to run from sub-$10 to $60."
Here we go end of day run!
CNBC is on FuboTV Starter Plan at $64.99
Ron/ Alex/ Tom =
Huge profit coming in a few months. This is the next Amazon.
"Shorts tried to break us down with their insidious ways, but bulls are winning out right now BIG TIME. We are too strong for them."
time to start nibbling on this stock. I think we are foing to see the runup for a double in the next year
I heard about FUBO the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
He is hitting it out of the ball park! no pun intended! launch is Thursday!
Can this obliterate the 200-day moving average at $29.33 today? It's acting strong
maybe 30 by Friday
"We’re going to 60, everybody knows it and there’s nothing you can do about it."
Finally got around to watching the BMO webcast from two days ago. The tone and focus was quite different from the same old stuff we’ve been hearing about for the last few weeks.￼ The biggest take away was info on time and expense to get licensed in all the different states. 50M+ for most states going up to 100 million for big expensive ones. It turns out they are preparing for those expenses by raising this ATM.￼ There is a link on the fubo investors page.￼
"Wow, it just went next level, it's bursting"
"$FUBO is beyond a bargain. Under $10 billion market cap is cheap, cheap, cheap. Remember, we are just over a month away from the FUBO sportsbook going live. If you love sports, this is the package to go with, and most everyone loves one sport or another or all and if you want to be able to watch all sports for cheap, Fubo's offering in the way to go, hands down."
"Up to $29.54 in AH, high!"
Here we go charging towards green!
"CNBC 3 p.m. interview with CEO will be the launching pad for the bulls.As for the bears, ummm no comments."
weird to watch on cnbc when they started talking about Fubo the stock went green almost instantly.
College Football Season coming back big this weekend!
Easy money
Someone should make a YouTube live and get this thing to the 60s in the next couple days! Tons of shorts on here we could make it go up so fast!
Ron =
Ron where you at now
"Some aren’t giving respect to the subscriber numbers and growth rate of subscribers and cost savings of cutting the cord from cable, which is a big trend with 4k smart TVs that are seeing a groundswell in the last few months. FUBO was successful in subscribers coming to their platform, they can do the same for bettors. This company has some magic that makes $3.9B look cheap."
They haven’t counted all the subscription from gold cup and copa America yet in July! All the new subscribers in august from college football and the NFL plus all the new subscribers for the liga and the Italian league in Canada! Plus the World Cup is coming and the revenue they’re making from ads now will cover their losses in a couple months! Plus live betting getting approved left and right!
Short at the open tomorrow for easy $$
Load the boat. This baby is going much higher.
Sorry but Fubo is going to get out soon for around 9 billion from Apple
"MACD crossover is about to occur, this is what happened before the big move on August 9th. This is the shorts last gasp."
Guys don’t listen to Ron I took his advice and shorted FUBO yesterday and got margin called today. This stock is going to run once it gets above $30. Gonna try buy back in tomorrow and make up for my sins lol
And it's FUBO ahead by three links.
"Gander is one smart cookie. I'm confident his CNBC interview (3 p.m. Power Hour) this afternoon will knock it out of the ballpark. Also, expecting an extra SP push after the interview. : )"
Two days to cover by the shorts! Make them pay!
"$30 would be nice but i really don,t care! This stock is headed for no less then $47 at some point this year ,This stock has tremendous rebound resiliency and at these prices is it still a buy ! Subcription TV is a persons choice to watch just about anything in the world and when FUBO does the deal with sportskings and Golden nugget my price of $47 will look also like a bargain when it becomes in the $70 dollar range! Stick with it folks ,this share price will disappear from these numbers and you will have wished you bought more!"
Are we looking at three points tomorrow? Finally breaking out of the 20s once and for all.￼￼
How is this diferent from you tube tv or live tv on other apps? They have sports too and the same 65 a month ... I just got fios and said F it.
Oooo news
Such a strong stock
Verizon fios all you need to watch alittle something and go out and enjoy life
25% shorts on here literally could go to 50 in the right settings!
It's funny Ron posting on here instead of covering while the hedgehogs he represents are losing
Q4 sports betting begins on FUBO. By the end of 2022 it will be all 50 states.
I'm confident we have one of the best up and coming CEOs out there.
"Imho, we're experiencing selling pressure because Fubo is selling based on their $500M offering. They are offloading to raise the cash they need for their next move. Not worried at all, the selling will stop sooner vs. later."
"It might take a few more weeks, a few more months, maybe even two to three more quarters for the general public to recognize the full potential of Fubo's sportsbook. But rest assured, once that happens the stock price will go to the moon. FUBO will be a 10x stock, and it will be my early (very early) retirement fund."
Wow we went through the 50-day moving average like it was nothing!
Not only will their sports betting be unlike anything else. But when we can bet on reality tv that’s gonna be wild and capture society’s attention
This is bound to go to the 30s early in September and 40s in October!
"Sports’ first live TV streaming platform fuboTV’s subsidiary Fubo Gaming has secured a market access agreement in Arizona for the soon-to-be-available Fubo Sportsbook mobile app via the Ak-Chin Indian Community.Ak-Chin Indian Community, located in northwestern Pinal County, was established by presidential decree in 1912. There are approximately 1,100 tribal members of the community who remain agrarian-focused and have Ak-Chin Farms, where barley, potatoes, alfalfa and corn are grown over 15,000 acres.Ak-Chin Indian Community said it was gratifying to have received a special license to offer online sports betting via a mobile app, available in Arizona. It said that after the license was awarded, it forged its partnership with Fubo Gaming to develop and operate a mobile app for online sports betting.“This is a hugely exciting day for the entire Indian community in Ak-Chin,” said Ak-Chin leader Robert Miguel. “With this sportsbook license and our strategic partnership with Fubo Sports, we know we will be able to offer our customers the best entertainment experience they have ever expected from Ak-Chin, whether they visit our sportsbook in person. or online. “Sportsbooks are allowed to start marketing activities and register Arizona customers immediately. The first sports bets can be placed from 9 September 2021.Fubo Sportsbook is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in each market. The new agreement marks Fubo Gaming’s fifth market access agreement after Pennsylvania (via The Cordish Companies), New Jersey and Indiana (via Caesars Entertainment) and Iowa (via Casino Queen).“We are excited to partner with Ak-Chin for a market access agreement in Arizona,” said Fubo Gaming President Scott Butera. “Our comprehensive sports entertainment experience will combine real money sales with fuboTV’s live sports offering for a seamless user experience that allows consumers to bet while watching. Arizonans are passionate professional and collegiate sports fans who we believe will enjoy the market that defines Fubo Sportsbook. ”"
Undervalued at $3.83B market cap. This thing is cheap!
$50 by Halloween?
About to go green buddies!
It is so peaceful muting Ron
"Two consecutive up days after today’s move, these usually come in threes! Looking forward to tomorrow"
"DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM highlight the list of 18 statewide mobile sportsbooks approved by Arizona regulators to take online and retail sports bets as early as next month.The aforementioned trio, the nation’s three largest operators by national market share, are targeting similar success in Arizona, one of the nation’s most anticipated new sports betting markets. Other major brands such as Caesars, Bally Bet and PointsBet have also made Arizona a major focal point of their nationwide expansion plans.Sportsbooks approved by the Arizona Department of Gaming can start taking bets Sept. 9, the first day of the 2021 NFL regular season. Lawsuits are pending that will seek to delay the opening, but it remains to be seen what impact it will have on legal sports betting’s launch.Assuming no further legal or logistical delays, the following books can begin promotions in the state and player sign-ups at 12:01 am local time Saturday (retail partner in paratheses):Bally Bet (WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury)Barstool Sportsbook (Phoenix Raceway; NASCAR Championship race host track)Betfred (Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation)BetMGM (NFL’s Arizona Cardinals and State Farm Stadium; Gila River tribes’ Wild Horse Pass, Vee Quiva and Lone Butte casinos)BetRivers (Indoor Football’s Arizona Rattlers)Caesars (MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks and Chase Field; Harrah’s Ak-Chin Casino)Digital GamingDraftKings (TPC Scottsdale; PGA Tour’s Phoenix Open host course)FanDuel (NBA’s Phoenix Suns- and Footprint Center)Fubo GamingGolden NuggetSuperBookTwinSpires (Tonto Apache Tribe’s Mazatzal Casino)Unibet (Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe’s Quechan Casino)WynnBet (San Carlos Apache Nation’s Apache Gold Casino ResortThe Arizona Coyotes and several additional tribes also earned licenses but have not announced their sportsbook operating partner.Arizona Sports Betting BackgroundArizona, Wyoming and South Dakota are all expected to take their respective first legal sports bet in early September. They will join 21 other states and Washington D.C. among a growing list of states with legal sports betting options.Unlike Wyoming (online only) and South Dakota (retail only), Arizona will allow both statewide mobile and retail sportsbooks. Arizona is the nation’s first state to divide licenses evenly between professional sports organizations and federally recognized gaming tribes.There were 19 eligible tribes for the 10 allocated tribal licenses, 16 of which applied for licensure.Additional tribal operating partners including BlueBet (Colorado River Indian Tribes) and MaximBet (White Mountain Apache Tribe) also missed out on licenses.All 19 tribes signed onto an updated 2021 gaming compact can open retail sportsbooks at their respective gaming properties, regardless their online license status.Along with the 10 tribes, Arizona’s 2021 sports betting legislation permitted up to 10 sportsbooks partnered with professional sports teams. There are thee remaining pro sports licenses available, which could be awarded to a future MLS team or other sports franchises or organizations that begin play or relocate to the state.The opening date for most retail sportsbooks is to be determined. Many tribal casinos have already prepared sportsbook “lounges” or betting areas at their respective casinos and some will likely start taking retail bets on or shortly after the go-live date.The professional sports team partners are also planning books at their respective venues but there is no firm timeline. MGM believes its BetMGM book at State Farm Stadium will come sometime in the coming months.Other partners, such as FanDuel at Footprint Center and Caesars at Chase Field are looking to open retail books before their affiliated teams begin their upcoming seasons. Additionally, Barstool and the Phoenix Raceway are hoping to open before the NASCAR Championship race in November, while DraftKings and TPC Scottsdale are targeting a lunch before next year’s Phoenix Open.Next StepsMost if not all the online sports betting licensees will likely begin marketing heavily on Saturday and leading through the launch day. These operators will also seek to go live on the Sept. 9 date and ahead of the 2021 NFL season opener between the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Arizona Cardinals open their season Sept. 12 at the Tennessee Titans.Arizona’s comparatively quick turnaround from sports betting legalization to first bet will allow operators to capture the entire NFL season, perennially American sportsbooks’ most lucrative time of the year. Other states that passed 2021 sports betting legislation including Connecticut, Louisiana and Maryland will miss at least a portion of this year’s football season.That access to football bettors reaffirms operators’ excitement for the potential market in one of the nation’s fastest-growing states and largest metro areas. Unlike in neighboring Nevada, eligible bettors over age 21 and physically within Arizona state lines"
Going up and great things coming in the next couple of weeks!
Great time to short just b4 Gandler goes on CNBC we know he want to sell also

"If You say ""How is fuboTV any different from YouTube TV?"" shouldn't that be enough to know? If You believe STREAMING ENTERTAINMENT is the Now & Future then FUBO is Your Opportunity to Buy Shares DIRECTLY into CABLE TV ALTERNATIVES.

Tons of shorts on here so you know they will have to buy back no matter what!
"Who cares Ron, Musk does it, that isn't a valid point at all"
"If you don’t have the business experiences or investment experience to see why it’s cheap then this board can’t really help you see it. And there’s a 20% short interest out there, so lots of detractors. The bulls see it."
