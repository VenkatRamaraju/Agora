"DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM highlight the list of 18 statewide mobile sportsbooks approved by Arizona regulators to take online and retail sports bets as early as next month.The aforementioned trio, the nation’s three largest operators by national market share, are targeting similar success in Arizona, one of the nation’s most anticipated new sports betting markets. Other major brands such as Caesars, Bally Bet and PointsBet have also made Arizona a major focal point of their nationwide expansion plans.Sportsbooks approved by the Arizona Department of Gaming can start taking bets Sept. 9, the first day of the 2021 NFL regular season. Lawsuits are pending that will seek to delay the opening, but it remains to be seen what impact it will have on legal sports betting’s launch.Assuming no further legal or logistical delays, the following books can begin promotions in the state and player sign-ups at 12:01 am local time Saturday (retail partner in paratheses):Bally Bet (WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury)Barstool Sportsbook (Phoenix Raceway; NASCAR Championship race host track)Betfred (Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation)BetMGM (NFL’s Arizona Cardinals and State Farm Stadium; Gila River tribes’ Wild Horse Pass, Vee Quiva and Lone Butte casinos)BetRivers (Indoor Football’s Arizona Rattlers)Caesars (MLB’s Arizona Diamondbacks and Chase Field; Harrah’s Ak-Chin Casino)Digital GamingDraftKings (TPC Scottsdale; PGA Tour’s Phoenix Open host course)FanDuel (NBA’s Phoenix Suns- and Footprint Center)Fubo GamingGolden NuggetSuperBookTwinSpires (Tonto Apache Tribe’s Mazatzal Casino)Unibet (Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe’s Quechan Casino)WynnBet (San Carlos Apache Nation’s Apache Gold Casino ResortThe Arizona Coyotes and several additional tribes also earned licenses but have not announced their sportsbook operating partner.Arizona Sports Betting BackgroundArizona, Wyoming and South Dakota are all expected to take their respective first legal sports bet in early September. They will join 21 other states and Washington D.C. among a growing list of states with legal sports betting options.Unlike Wyoming (online only) and South Dakota (retail only), Arizona will allow both statewide mobile and retail sportsbooks. Arizona is the nation’s first state to divide licenses evenly between professional sports organizations and federally recognized gaming tribes.There were 19 eligible tribes for the 10 allocated tribal licenses, 16 of which applied for licensure.Additional tribal operating partners including BlueBet (Colorado River Indian Tribes) and MaximBet (White Mountain Apache Tribe) also missed out on licenses.All 19 tribes signed onto an updated 2021 gaming compact can open retail sportsbooks at their respective gaming properties, regardless their online license status.Along with the 10 tribes, Arizona’s 2021 sports betting legislation permitted up to 10 sportsbooks partnered with professional sports teams. There are thee remaining pro sports licenses available, which could be awarded to a future MLS team or other sports franchises or organizations that begin play or relocate to the state.The opening date for most retail sportsbooks is to be determined. Many tribal casinos have already prepared sportsbook “lounges” or betting areas at their respective casinos and some will likely start taking retail bets on or shortly after the go-live date.The professional sports team partners are also planning books at their respective venues but there is no firm timeline. MGM believes its BetMGM book at State Farm Stadium will come sometime in the coming months.Other partners, such as FanDuel at Footprint Center and Caesars at Chase Field are looking to open retail books before their affiliated teams begin their upcoming seasons. Additionally, Barstool and the Phoenix Raceway are hoping to open before the NASCAR Championship race in November, while DraftKings and TPC Scottsdale are targeting a lunch before next year’s Phoenix Open.Next StepsMost if not all the online sports betting licensees will likely begin marketing heavily on Saturday and leading through the launch day. These operators will also seek to go live on the Sept. 9 date and ahead of the 2021 NFL season opener between the Dallas Cowboys and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Arizona Cardinals open their season Sept. 12 at the Tennessee Titans.Arizona’s comparatively quick turnaround from sports betting legalization to first bet will allow operators to capture the entire NFL season, perennially American sportsbooks’ most lucrative time of the year. Other states that passed 2021 sports betting legislation including Connecticut, Louisiana and Maryland will miss at least a portion of this year’s football season.That access to football bettors reaffirms operators’ excitement for the potential market in one of the nation’s fastest-growing states and largest metro areas. Unlike in neighboring Nevada, eligible bettors over age 21 and physically within Arizona state lines"

"When the dam breaks on this one, it’s not going to stop for a while! So much great news lately."
"The Arizona Department of Gaming announced 18 of the 20 available licenses for AZ sportsbooks despite a potentially delayed launch.The regulator announced 10 tribal licensees and eight professional sports licensees.Sports betting in Arizona is scheduled to launch Sept. 9, the same night the NFL season begins.That might not be the case if either of the two lawsuits filed against the ADG lead to a temporary injunction, of course. An ADG spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuits when contacted by LSR.What AZ sportsbooks will launch?While the ADG announced 18 license winners, only 15 AZ sportsbooks partners are known:Bally Bet: WNBA‘s Phoenix Mercury.Barstool Sportsbook: Phoenix Raceway.BetFred: Ft. McDowell Yavapai Nation.BetMGM: NFL’s Arizona Cardinals. Notably, fellow BetMGM partner Gila River did not receive a license.BetRivers: Indoor Football League’s Arizona Rattlers.Betway: San Juan Southern Palute Tribe.Caesars Sportsbook: MLB‘s Arizona Diamondbacks.DraftKings Sportsbook: TPC Scottsdale.FanDuel Sportsbook: NBA‘s Phoenix Suns.Fubo Gaming: Ak-Chin Indian Community.Golden Nugget: Hualapai Tribe.SuperBook: Fort Mojave Indian Tribe.TwinSpires: Tonto Apache Tribe.Unibet: Quechan Tribe.WynnBET: San Carlos Apache Tribe.Whatever sportsbooks are ready can begin signing up bettors on Saturday. That is the same day DFS contests launch in the state.Some brands still unknownFour license winners did not announce sportsbook partners by Friday:Navajo NationNHL‘s Arizona CoyotesTohono O’odham NationNotables missing from AZ sportsbooks announcedThree known partnerships did not make the cut:PointsBet is the biggest name to not receive a license. The brand partnered with the Yavapai-Apache Nation (not to be confused with the Yavapai-Prescott suing the ADG.)BlueBet missing out on a license is not shocking considering there were six more applicants than licenses available. The company partnered with the Colorado River Indian Tribes for a license but has no US operations or brand.MaximBet did not receive a license either. It partnered with the White Mountain Apache Tribe."

"Sports’ first live TV streaming platform fuboTV’s subsidiary Fubo Gaming has secured a market access agreement in Arizona for the soon-to-be-available Fubo Sportsbook mobile app via the Ak-Chin Indian Community.Ak-Chin Indian Community, located in northwestern Pinal County, was established by presidential decree in 1912. There are approximately 1,100 tribal members of the community who remain agrarian-focused and have Ak-Chin Farms, where barley, potatoes, alfalfa and corn are grown over 15,000 acres.Ak-Chin Indian Community said it was gratifying to have received a special license to offer online sports betting via a mobile app, available in Arizona. It said that after the license was awarded, it forged its partnership with Fubo Gaming to develop and operate a mobile app for online sports betting.“This is a hugely exciting day for the entire Indian community in Ak-Chin,” said Ak-Chin leader Robert Miguel. “With this sportsbook license and our strategic partnership with Fubo Sports, we know we will be able to offer our customers the best entertainment experience they have ever expected from Ak-Chin, whether they visit our sportsbook in person. or online. “Sportsbooks are allowed to start marketing activities and register Arizona customers immediately. The first sports bets can be placed from 9 September 2021.Fubo Sportsbook is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in each market. The new agreement marks Fubo Gaming’s fifth market access agreement after Pennsylvania (via The Cordish Companies), New Jersey and Indiana (via Caesars Entertainment) and Iowa (via Casino Queen).“We are excited to partner with Ak-Chin for a market access agreement in Arizona,” said Fubo Gaming President Scott Butera. “Our comprehensive sports entertainment experience will combine real money sales with fuboTV’s live sports offering for a seamless user experience that allows consumers to bet while watching. Arizonans are passionate professional and collegiate sports fans who we believe will enjoy the market that defines Fubo Sportsbook. ”"
It's look strong ronda
"It might take a few more weeks, a few more months, maybe even two to three more quarters for the general public to recognize the full potential of Fubo's sportsbook. But rest assured, once that happens the stock price will go to the moon. FUBO will be a 10x stock, and it will be my early (very early) retirement fund."
