Reverse head and shoulders. Nice!
"This company appears to be purchasing The Ordinary brand, which is significantly popular among people I know. Something to consider"
guys can someone kindly explain to me why EL is down this big today???
From 10/11/21 Estee Lauder Companies Inc : JP Morgan raises target price to $378 from $367
"Estee Lauder downgraded by Piper Jaffray, who says teenagers are wearing less makeupThat's why EL is down today. What a bonehead move by Piper Jaffray. Teens have never been the major customers for Estee Lauder, and makeup is different from skincare. I saw from my wife's collection of skincare products, hundreds of dollars spending every month, Estee Lauder makes majority of them. EL has been doing great internationally, especially in Asia and China.Expecting a earning beat this coming ER. EL will make a new high after that."
Looks like a retest of $300 is coming. Good buying opportunity there.
Chinese market is shrinking hugely!
"Told the shorts not to go after this company. Huge profit beat. Also, when you look at their financials there is a lot to like. Extremely high gross margin, 5.5 billion in cash and short term investment, 1.5 billion free cash flow. This company is making money and will ultimately take out 300 in the future."

Anyone notice celebrities are no longer wearing makeup? What if this becomes a trend when this COVID thing is all over?
