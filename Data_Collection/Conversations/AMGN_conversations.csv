"I can't understand this big drop, any bad news?"
wow......what a #$%$....
"$AMRN , JT presentation today is super strong BP wake up and buyout this company even at $50B looks cheap going forward $PFE $AMGN. $NVS. $GSK spend the money it’s worth it, ADA Standard of Care , Diabetes community is a very lucrative big market 90 million of them according to JT , wow that alone counts in BILLIONS, JT always says we’re not competing in Statins $500B markets but Triglycerides and Cholesterol is entangled now that will take many BILLIONS from that, Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s and Cancers future collaborators are looking at that too, AMRN is severely undervalued here and should be close to $100/Shares, A game changer just like $BYND and $UBER in each industry"
Is this company worth 10 billion less than it was on Tuesday because of one Phase III disappointment?
Way below 50& 200 day moving averages! Not interested till forward P.E.below 10 & dividend over 4%
Maybe AMGN should just try selling aspirin. So many others must have a headache following this losing stock. Nothing they try to sell seems to help....
Is Amgen Vertex with a dividend ?

"Looking for a healthcare stock to drip long term. Amgn seems to have the stock price and dividend appreciation, but, where will this company be thirty years from now? Or should I just go with jnj? Thanks."
"The ""dead-cat"" bounce yesterday is proving to be just that. Giving it all back today, and then some. AMGN is headed for sub-200 territory before year-end. The fund managers are running for the hills big-time. Meanwhile, VTI hit a new all-time high today. AMGN was once a great stock. Not anymore."
"Pick some up at $177 today, like the value here. Add to PFE as well. At this point will not touch health insurance companies even though don't think Medicare for All will get approved."
They had some interesting insights about AMGN on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Just bought 300 shares hope I did not make a mistake.
"Aside from being in an industry that's out of favor, there's nothing not to like about AMGN. Continuing to hold my shares for the long term. Good luck AMGN longs."
Looks like accumulation... cup/handle formation technically.. agree with product line improving.
Sotorosib news is BIG. I wouldn't be surprised if this was why the stock was up so much in the pre-market 2 days ago. It will take a little while for the news to move the stock. But i believe it will.
Revenue up 60% over the past decade.Earnings up 75% over past decade.EPS up 180% over past decade.Dividend was non-existent a decade ago and now pays $5.54 annually and continues to rise.And... Share count has declined by 40% and continues to decline.Absolutely brilliant!!!
"Quote. ""They are typically weakest in the first quarter due to seasonality in patient volumes and then bounce in Q2 on a recovery in buying patterns and patient volumes,"" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in an email."
"The Enbrel patent win will cause earnings estimates to rise ""significantly"". Upgrades and rising earning estimates for Amgen are coming. Analyst will get on board next week. Target $230 by EOY."
love this stock
"Bull. No need to be cautious here.... Amgen’s PE is quite low....and, earning are gonna be great. In other words, back up the truck while price is depressed!!!!!! Maybe mortgage your home, and buy. Buy low, sell high. "
"Remember $AMRN sNDA market is X20 Analysts have to adjust price target accordingly, $PFE or $GSK or $AMGN highest bidder wins"
"So far I have found that AMGN’s innovation outlook is trending down based on a current score of 68 out of 99, outperforming sector average. Jobs growth over the past year has decreased and insiders sentiment is neutral. AMGN is an Average Performer in terms of sustainability. It is most exposed to Shire plc as its supplier. Over the past 4 quarters AMGN beat earnings estimates 4 times and it pays dividend higher than its peers.What gets you excited about AMGN? I am looking to add to my watchlist and want to know why I should add, here is another one I have been watching to give you an idea of what I usually look for. https://emergingstocks.market/zy447"
"Be careful of how shorties and Mr and Mrs Negativos affect your mindset and want you to lose money so they can put it in their bank account. This is on Yahoo Finance news: Amgen's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. If your new in this game, this is a key factor. Gotta watch out for the shorties and Mr & Mrs Negativos. They are very abundant. Click on their name and you can see how they post. Also search this: Amgen Changes the Narrative With Cancer Drug Breakthrough. This was released on August 4th 2019. Also search this; This just happened yesterday on 9 Aug 2019 ""Amgen Wins Patent Case On Enbrel (etanercept)"" This is when the stock increased by $11.02 in one day. This occurred at the end of the day starting at: 3:30 pm EST. ½ hour before the official price for the day at 4pm. Before 3:30 pm EST, almost every minute they were selling well under 10,000 shares per minute. A lot of 1,2 and 3 thousand shares per per minute. THEN AFTER THIS NEWS CAME OUT ON WINNING COURT CASE ON 2 PATENTS. THEN MAJOR INVESTING OCCURRED, I DON’T KNOW WHO BUT PEOPLE AND OR COMPANIES WITH DEEP POCKET BOOKS STARTED BUYING BIG TIME!!! EVERY MINUTE FROM 3:30 TO 4PM. OVER 100,000 SHARES WERE BEING SOLD PER MINUTE. WHAT’S BEEN OCCURING WITH AMGEN RECENTLY, LAST FEW WEEKS, IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT. BUT SPECIFIC PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS WILL WANT YOU BELIEVE IT’S BAD, BAD, BAD!To see number of shares sold per minute, just click on summary, then over to the right click on full screen, then click on 1 Day and you’ll see I’m telling you the truth."
Looks like the shorts are trying to take this stock down before the sound of the bell. They do that so much. Amgn is a powerful company. Look at long term trend. They can't stop it. Will keep going up through all of the ups and downs.
I think AMGN gravitates back to the $180-$185 area. I got very oversold and the goods news today should move it higher. Hesitation today occurred when Nasdaq plunged. This is the type of stock you want in a slowing economy with Fed cuts looming. Great balance sheet. Big buyback. Great yield. I think is a strong buy.
I will lighten up on AMGN it was a good value at .34 cents and I missed it. I read the announcements and wanted to be part of this great company but its not going to 1000 from here. I am late to the party and can't turn back the hands of time the float is too big for the growth I need .
"Stay long!The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February granted priority review status to sotorasib, Amgen's experimental lung cancer drug. The company on Tuesday said it is studying different doses of the drug and expects to have data from combination studies in the second half of this year."
"On Dec 14 or 15, expect about 20 cents increase in dividend. With 40 Billion in the bank, they can afford it."
The company buying a few shares today??
"AMRN JT will raise price of Vascepa 20% and will get a $50B buyout, $PFE. $GILD. $AMGN broad label plus NASH and Alzheimer’s is coming"

"Amgen - new rally possibleIf the Amgen share succeeds in breaking out of the flag, which currently requires a daily closing price above USD 255.83, then a further rally towards USD 264.97 and USD 288.85 would be possible."

hmm i was expecting a bit more of a positive reaction to Aimovig being FDA approved. hopefully it closes strong today.
Is this all about AMG510? Maybe that and the fact the stock was off almost $40 from its highs? Love it.
Looking forward to see the increase of dividend from $1.45 to $1.55 or $1.60 next week. Thank you AMGN.

Very very great value stock ..! WillNever sell this one .!
"This market is too volatile, but want to add more AMGN, so own the selling puts for $210 and $175 strike price due this week. The $210 will get a high chance to get assigned."
"I decided to withdraw my offer of $195 in the Dutch Auction. It most likely wouldn't have hit, but I decided I didn't want to take the chance. AMGN is trading at a forward P/E of 13ish, which is historically low. The earnings per share should rise even if actual earnings don't with the pending share repurchase. Their pipeline is strong and sales continue to rise for some of their most important drugs. They also have a balance sheet ready to make acquisitions both small and large. Lots to like here. Good luck AMGN longs..."

Huge gains coming after announcement about being ADDED to DOW. Stay long and prosper
"IMO the Big Boys like $REGN, $GILD, $PFE, $AMGN, $LLY, etc. could be looking at $SRNE as a potential acquisition target with its vast product pipeline and modest market cap."

"I will buy Amgen at 215$, not before!"
"oh brother - i had put in a buy at 235 some time back, and of course it executed this morning on the open as it crashed to 228. I picked up some more at 228. Shouldnt go lower than 220 and you get 3% for hanging out."

LOOKS GOOD TO BUY???????????? THOUGHTS????
"So we have a major health care crisis. And Amgen is running TV ads for Aimovig. It may or may not affect the immune system. Many drugs do. But it can cause serious problems with allergic reactions with trips to the emergency room for trouble breathing. Some people need hospitalization and surgery for severe constipation. Why in the world would Amgen be selling a drug right now, that is requiring possible medical treatment, when our hospitals are already overloaded. I urge the Corona Task Force to force drug companies from showing ads for drugs like this, until the emergency passes. Shareholders should be up in arms, calling management and demanding they sacrifice, like the rest of the country is doing."
My gut feeling is that AMGN will fall at least 60 points after reporting the earning this evening.
Go to Bloomberg Law to read. Amgen won appeal to block Novartis from providing a biosimilar to Amgen Enbrel until 2029.

"Nice action today, currently up over 2%. With the stock buybacks that have certainly happened by now, those long AMGN shares likely own a bigger percentage of the company than they did just a few months ago. The lower share count will help EPS going forward while allowing higher dividend payouts since there are now fewer shares to pay dividends to. AMGN's pipeline is still strong, balance sheet solid... Lots to like here! Assuming no macro-changes in the broader market, I'd expect to revisit prior highs fairly soon. Good luck AMGN longs..."
"AMGN shares will ""eventually"" reflect the good news on this treatment for lung cancer."
"Having VODG in your portfolio may be like having PFE before it had FDA approval on Viagra.

It's currently fast tracked by the FDA for 2 FDA approvals, for Osteoarthritis, and Concussion Regenerative Therapy, and it now has a stemcell activation over-the-counter supplement it just started selling to the public."

From a technical standpoint any thoughts on if this falls below 200$?
"The only name among the three that's a truly compelling buy here and now is Amgen.Yes, the pandemic remains a stumbling block, but last month's selling has pulled the stock back to its late-2019 prices; the market is pricing in bigger problems than it actually has. This is the same company behind blockbuster drugs like Otezla, Enbrel, and cholesterol-fighting Repatha, just to name a few. It then has about 17 other drugs in its portfolio to round its list of revenue creators and dozens more in its pipeline.There's certainly no lack of opportunity here, and newcomers will be stepping into Amgen's deep R&D bench while its dividend yield (based on a payout that isn't exactly threatened at this time) is a healthy 3.2%."
New drug bill could hurt many drug company profits! The reason the prices in a lot of these companies are falling? Any thoughts?
"Don’t you just love giving up your previous week’s gains? This has been going on for 6 months. Enough, already."
Need to move out of California and lower costs for company and their employees and eliminate company's heavy California income tax burden. Why do they think they can compete long term with the extra heavy California burdens that competitors don't share?
buying when yield is 4% and you know its heading there when the stock is trickling down red everyday
The street seems to only be focused on AMZN and GOOGL and no mention of other companies reporting after the bell!
"Selling equal contracts of JAN 2022 $230 and $200 puts for $15 and $4.5 respectively to build more positions in AMGN. If both strike prices get assigned when expire in next Jan, I'll get the shares averaging around $205. Otherwise I just collect the premiums. Pfizer/Biotech vaccine full approval will also help AMGN since due to covid people delay treatment which affects AMGN sales. Vaccine full approval will encourage more people to get the shots."

Starting to really hate these big cap drug companies as an investor. They all look so undervalued and pay good dividends but there is no growth even when they beat numbers.

I'm really not getting this. Amgen is a good company that is profitable and has a great dividend. Surely this can't be all because of Bernie Sanders Medicare for All proposal! This sector is completely battered with no end in sight!
Just pay me the dividend I don’t care about the other noise.
"There's never a lot of shares sold with AMGN, average is 2.7 million. The money you get quarterly from a share is awesome. I don't know the exact percentage but it looks like over 95% of the people who have bought shares, hold onto them. When you get paid quarterly, it nice, nice, nice :)"

Here's something really good from Deny: Deny22 hours agoAnalysts don't have a clue about the importance of an effective and safe orally-administered inhibitor of KRAS mutations which comprise 15-30% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC. EGFR inhibitors (10-15%) and ALK inhibitors (5%) are huge blockbusters. The very impressive efficacy results in a Phase I dose escalation study are above and beyond what anyone expected. The only disappointment should be in the density of the Wall Street analysts who really don't understand cancer drug development and never will.

There is a Big difference between taking profit and selling your entire position. The purpose of investing is to make a profit. Using your profits to pay bills or buy other stocks should always be your goal. Congratulations on buying early and seeing the growth potential even back then.

"Hardly any effort at a reflex rally is a very bad sign for the near-term future of AMGN stock, and after hours price backs that up. I see AMGN at $185-175 before year-end. Fund managers are running for the hills. It appears at least some of the money moved over to LLY."
This stock is going to explode next week when earnings are released. NEW 2018 target $240
"The recent drop in AMGN is a perfect example of why I strongly advocate NOT owning individual stocks, especially anything pharma. The risk of not having adequate diversification can be devastating. I advise individual investors own something like VTI instead. VTI gives the investor some AMGN plus about another 3600 other stocks to shield against the unexpected and unavoidable. Owning individual stocks is pure gambling and should be left to the pros."

"GUYS! Think about it. Pfizer ($PFE) lost $8+ BILLION per year (PER FRIGGEN YEAR) after generics were introduced in 2011, on average. $8 BILLION x about 7 years = $56 BILLION LOSS opportunity cost!

"The companies that are involved in antibody therapeutics and treatments have been selling off. Amgen is partnered with Lilly in this venture. Regeneron is also manufacturing an antibody drug which the FDA has been dragging its feet on approval. The media seems more focused on the actual vaccine makers, such as MRNA, PFE, and AZN now. Maybe its cost and supply issues. And WHO seems to be extremely negative on GILD's remdesivir treatment. All of this is confusing to an investor! I am long AMGN, REGN and PFE and recently relinquished my shares of GILD. Frustrating to say the least and kinda wished I had avoided anything involved in a covid treatment!"
I just keep buying the dips in these oversold jewels of health care
Buffet said the most important quality in investing is temperament. If you did your research you would be either adding more or selling
"Amgen is undervalued compared to the industry average (biotechnology). The share is traded with a price-earnings ratio (P / E) of 13.1, so that there is a difference of 79 percent compared to the industry P / E of 63.55. This results in a ""buy"" recommendation on a fundamental basis."
Below 200$ & 4 % dividend & I am in! Looks like we are on the way!
FDA Approval of Amgen's Aimovig for the prevention of migraines is a BIG deal. There is a large number of people who suffer from migraines. GREAT work Amgen!!
My understanding is that of the 13 patients tested half of them (7) saw tumor shrinkage of 30% and apparently the analysts were expecting the results to indicate a 50% shrinkage result and thus the disappointment. 9 of the 13 or 69% are still taking the daily dose and 2 of the partial participants have died.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will not sell stock with 3.2% dividend yield and such low P/E at current price. Thank you"

Crerdit Swisse raises target from 252 to 290 and Oppenheimer raise from 252 to 265 today.
At these levels we need a 2 for 1 split.
"AMGN is undervalued pretty much any way you look at it right now. Trailing twelve month P/E of 13.88, EV/EBITDA of 10, free cash flow yield 9.49 percent. Not to mention a solid dividend that is more than adequately covered by the cash flow. They also have a plentiful supply of cash on hand, almost $11 billion, as well as huge gross and operating margins. Pipeline is solid as well. I see this as a solid investment over the next few years that pays you a nice income stream to wait for the capital gains. It's a win win."
swapped out a bit of JNJ for AMGN today.
"Finally! It builds support and up it goes from here!We got lung cancer approved by FDA, and I can’t wait for FDA to approve the 2nd one!This will easily hits $300 by EOY, and not to mention great Divi!"
"look at this stock, if you can't see future then sell! Amgen makes you"
Buy the dip their earnings will be amazing
What's also baffling is amgn is in the dow!!! Dow up 408 at this moment!
"Soon the bad news is coming for AMGNMirati Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:MRTX): Mirati's KRAS inhibitor adagrasib has a Phase 2 readout in second-line and above non-small cell lung cancer settings in the second half, Gerberry said in the note. This readout offers more apples-to-apples comparison with Amgen, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMGN) sotorasib, which has already been approved, he added."
6 years in and up $100 per share!!
"FDA=woke. They will destroy the pharma industry, along with as much capitalism as they can."
Matt Harrison Morgan Stanley..great analyst says buy on weakness. Best biotech analyst on the street. PT 281 overweight. This is todays research note.
Gonna give it all back tomorrow. Par for the course with AMGN.
"Shorts better start covering buyouts rumors is back $PFE and $GSK , $AMGN should raise your bid"
"Simple, folks are selling amgn buying mrna"
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
"Anyone knows whats the news in biotech sector? Massive sell off, wiped out all gains in last few months."
"AMGN requiring employees to get ""vaccinated."" You cannot be ""vaccinated"" for the flu. Demo-fascist management..."
Does anyone know what the final price for Amgen's Dutch Auction ended up being?
Next GILD in making. I will be a buyer at $150 !!
"Short interest increasing, below 50 & 200 day moving average! Luv the dividend but going to be on sidelines till bottoming process complete! GLTL!"
"Very solid company, you would wish your grandpa had bought 50 ys ago."
"On February 1, 2018 we should hear what AMGN is going to do with all the REPATRIATED cash."
"HCW price target $51 for AMRN is more like it shorts burning is coming, buyouts rumors is back $PFE $NVS $GILD $AMGN needs to deploy your cash, money is so cheap right now"
Credit Truth on twitter:Notable that $AMGN is demonstrating a new level of confidence in $ARWR TRiMTrade mark sign by their manner of promoting progress with Lipoprotein(a) w/ AMG-890 formerly Arrowhead’s ARO-LPA https://amgenscience.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-lipoproteina/ Seems this blockbuster drug is moving quickly enough to merit this Amgen PR.https://www.amgenscience.com/features/10-things-to-know-about-lipoproteina/
"Last time AMGN was this low was 12/24/18. That was a nice Christmas present because ten trading days later it was over $200. Although the RSI is now down to 28, that is where it was on 12/24/18. I think I will buy more shares today."
"Amgn reiterated by Cowen with a target price of $204 and Morgan Stanley maintain its price target of $200. Cowen analyst, Eric Schmidt commented that Amgn soft guidance (just tweaking the low end of its revenue guidance) appears conservative in light of sales trends. He believes the share remain undervalued."
Someone know the earnings numbers before the release? AMGN jumped $5+ from 2;00 pm today to 3:40 pm. Someone was buying BIG.
"Look at $abbv breaking out to the upside and $amgn moving back up. Will bring a lot of small players along too after brutal last few months in biotech pharma. Want to see more M&A also, that’s what we need as tech money shifts to healthcare."
Drugmakers facing congress on Capital Hill today is leaning on the sector
"REVOLUTIONARY DRUG NEWS (anyone want to guess who makes it?): https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/10/revolutionary-lung-cancer-drug-made-available-on-nhs-in-england[START QUOTE]Lung cancer patients in England will become the first in Europe to benefit from a “revolutionary” new drug that can halt the growth of tumours by targeting the so-called “Death Star” mutation.The medication, Sotorasib, will be fast-tracked to NHS patients after it was proven in clinical trials to stop lung cancer growing for seven months.The drug targets the mutation on the KRAS gene, which is found in a quarter of all tumours and is known as the “Death Star” mutation because of its spherical appearance and impenetrable nature.“Sotorasib is one of the most exciting breakthroughs in lung cancer treatment in 20 years, targeting a cancer gene that was previously untargetable and built on decades of laboratory research that’s unravelled cancer’s inner workings,” said Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician. “This medicine expands our list of effective precision therapies in lung cancer that are helping to improve survival for patients with limited options. It’s great news that patients in England will now benefit from this novel treatment.”[END QUOTE]One thing I've recognized over time: Amgen has a tremendous history of science dating back to the 1980's. It is arguably the most storied biotech firm in all of history. Biotech can be volatile at times, because there are periods where the pipeline is still under development with no guarantee of success, as current drugs may be stagnating too. Amgen's been sort of in that phase lately. One should be prepared for that type of risk in their portfolios accordingly. However, Amgen seems to have a fantastic company/scientific culture and history of consistently delivering new blockbusters and breakthroughs and making smart moves. Time and time again, they come through. That's rare.Congratulations, Amgen. . . .I've learned not to bet against Amgen."
AMGN reached a new All Time High at 198.77
"Amgen actually raised the lower end of revenue and earnings guidance for the year. In other words, the average of the range just went up - indicating increased confidence by management. Now it's up to management to sell their story on the call."
"In 1995, I opened my first IRA & purchased 490 shares of AMGN at $10.90 per share! Despite its several ups & downs, I keep reinvesting those great dividends, have not yet sold one share & I sure ain't going to now!"
"jmo, AMGN was successful with it's administration of the 960mg dosage of AMG510. Seven experienced a tumor shrinkage of at least 30 per cent. Side effects seem minimal. The remaining patients' cancers were stabilized. FDA has granted fast track status. The analyst at JPM who is so negative has a success rate of only 42 percent according to TipRanks. This medicine is also being tested for cancer in other body organs, as well. Suggest investors wait to learn from AMGN presentation at Morgan Stanley conference this week before trading. Best wishes to longs"
Investors are too negative to biotech stocks. They are not relating to trade war. Biotech is about to rebound strongly.
"If $31B is the offer of $PFE , Is that good enough for yah? Think $AMGN could beat that"
"At current dividend rates don't sell, consider this as high yield bond if this will make you comfortable. Next week above 220"
Buyout could be anytime now $PFE or $AMGN huge premium knows the value of Vascepa’s
It's slippery slope now. Watch for 180.
looking at buying when i can get a 4% Dividend!
I will add that I am impressed that Amgen doesn't have a huge history of scandals like many other biotechs and pharma companies (whose Wikipedia pages are littered with scandal after scandal).
"....Analyst Actions: BMO Capital Raises Amgen's Price Target to $275 From $240, Maintains Outperform Rating"
"Like AMGN for its dividends and R&D pipeline. Started sell put options for OCT 18, $195 for $5. Good luck longs."
Why is it tanking today ? Down $11 . Any ideas
IBB hits 3 year high today. Hopefully AMGN does the same. Would like to see AMGN closes above 200 with conviction.
why down ? no logic
AMGN needs to buy Biogen while prices are down. 1.5 shares of AMGN for 1 Biogen. I approve.
"Fantastic intelligent and cheap company. Overlooked for its tremendous upside in many areas. While many no earnings bios soar, AMGN overlooked."
Looks like AMGN buying it's stock back. What do you think?
"AMRN buyout now starts at $120 up , $GILD in talks, $PFE and $AMGN too , Boooyah hot hot hot"
Both 50 DMA and 200 DMA have been taken out since the div day. Tough to see where the support it. May be 201-207 area!
I bought this 2 months ago. Not happy tight now.
"you hammer on the stock, but if you had to rely on a stock that would payout to support your kids college tuition, what stock are you choosing that has what Amgen has"
"If $EXEL is looking to diversify & add molecules in the clinic quickly w/ premier bi-specific Ab, then it needs to look into collaboration w/ $XNCR .Their collaboration with Genentech $RHHB Janssen $amgn $NVS MDAnderson morphosys $MOR Alexion $alxn Astellas (Japan) validates XNCR's technology. It's at least worth a look and there could be hugely beneficial arrangements for both parties. Xencor has very rich pipeline already and I am sure would be happy to have a partner take over some of these advanced molecules as well as with their excellent and much sought after bi-specific technology and premiere engineering platform, have many in early preclinical development. Doesn't mean EXEL needs to jump in but some due diligence and potential partnership would be time well spent. Bi-specific technology of biologics would nicely complement Exelixis' small molecule and ADC pipeline and collaborations."

In for the divvy
Today's drop of more than $6 doesn't look good. Wall Street must have gotten an early peek at the earnings.
Who ever though the 2% gains can hold during a down trend
MRTX rocketing on AMGN KRAS news/positive data.
I see things have not changed for the better overnight. Still down and still losing.
"VSTM massive upside coming its all about KRAS now HOT , check $MRTX and $AMGN"
"Pharma, energy, financial services, all things that made this country great, are the demo's enemy."
Another upgrade today. SunTrust Robinson raises price target to $268 from $254. All these upgrades but is still down.
Modified Dutch Auction. Can someone explain in Layman's terms? Thank you
good entry point.
"I highly recommend everyone visit Amgen's Pipeline page, review their pipeline and read about the 13 modalities in what they call their ""toolkit"". You'll feel pretty good about your investment in AMGN after doing so. Good luck AMGN longs."
"AMGN starting to make a move to “new highs”, following (two 2) partners of interest, ARWR & CYTK both companies, developing strong drug programs imo with AMGN partnerships!"
Woo Hoo!!
AMGN still cheap imo.
"Head's up ......be careful to note that Yahoo news is not always ""complete"". For instance Thompson Rueters reported that at Amgen's most recent board meeting they elected to increase their share buyback by an additional $5B. I do not understand why important company news is not disseminated widely and completely?"
Just look @ the 5 day chart & listen to stukin.
"Think the shorts didn’t read the $AMGN news will stop selling Repatha to expensive and doesn’t match efficacy of Vascepa’s, but buyout maybe on the way, will just raise the price of Vascepa, $PFE or $NVS still very interested"
This is the problem with biotechs. You can own shares in a company that is well established with many drugs in their pipeline and all it takes is for one of these drugs regardless of its relevance to have one hiccup and you’ll lose 8% sometimes much more in just one session. Very volatile sector. At least AMGN is a strong company and pays a good dividend and can better weather the storm. Look at CYTK!
"The highest bidder wins , I’m guessing $AMGN but then $PFE just raises money, Think were close"
"Got more share lZ and will hold it until it beats the Dow index, thanks"
"when it rides to $300 and pays $7,00 dividend"
Amgen is the real thing
"The Ravid on Twitter this morning :$ARWR has vast pipeline including several later stage assets, partnership with Janssen $JNJ for multiple assets, license with Amgen $AMGN; if they do 1 drug w/$1B sales @ 4x multiple (on a sale), you cover the current valuation, get the rest of platform and pipeline free."
Why's AMGN running Otezla ads that still say CELGENE at the bottom...?
"AMRN, let’s check the numbers HCW price target is $51 base on 6M target population, now with Reduced it/ CVD the new population target jump to 60M to 70M so , what’s gonna be Analysts price target now? Think BP $PFE $NVS $AMGN $AZN $BIIB $GILD $ABBV should partner or buyout, so many lives will be saved"
Barrons has a positive story. 20% upside in 2021 and $7 dividend.
"Reading into Bio Boy Scout’s Killer dig, looks like it’s getting late in the game for $VRTX to turn the tide on an $ARWR & $AMGN CF partnership. It would have been a nice partnership with Vertex but you gotta fish where the fish are biting."
"Think I'll add a few shares with the drop today.. E est. ramped up for FY22, div yield at all time high, superb double digit% DGR, rock solid divs with <40% PR. Below normal P/E...fits well into my increasing div paycheck early retired port.. %^)."
Stocks go up. I am chomping on shares like Lady Pacman here. See you in 2 years at 280....
I'll be a buyer @ $167
"I bought into Amgen many years ago, this is a great company with a great pipeline. read their bio"
only saving grace has been its dividend. many of these pharmas have done nothing in the past year.
"The trend is decidedly lower for AMGN. The fund managers are running for the exits. I expect the dividend to be raised by less than in recent years, so that won't help. All it will take is for one bad news announcement to slam AMGN below $200. With pharmaceuticals, that risk is always lurking in the weeds."
"Crazy 25 million shares are short holding the market cap below $6B maybe orchestrated by BP wanting to buy AMRN cheap or Institutions loading at cheap price about to end, the short squeezes will be epic, A monster drug in the making deserve a higher valuations, A $50B to $100B market cap in a few years if GIA same as $AMGN before EPOGEN ,"
Escaped with a gain today. But this is very tricky here.....
I didn't sell any shares today but I did take the opportunity to add shares of abbv and pfe on weakness that amgn is spilling on the etf's.. I think AMGN is being oversold but I also feel the conference call was horrendous and its obvious to me that competition is taking a pretty good bite out. The dividend is nice but doesn't help much when the stock is under-performing. Just stating the obvious. Will hopefully see some good news soon from new drugs in the pipeline. This management is looking pretty tired!
SomaLogic expands collaboration deal with Amgenhttps://www.dailycamera.com/2020/07/30/somalogic-expands-collaboration-deal-with-amgen/
"Have picked some AMGN on recent pull back at $193 before ex-dividend date. It's a great deal, price appreciation + dividend payout. Good luck longs."
"Down again pre-market. Poised to set a new 52 week low. And to think the financial geniuses see this stock at more than an average of $208 a share. T’would be nice, but seems hardly likely."
Hard to believe this closed at $195 on April 5th. Down almost 20 points and for no good reason.
Very sad to see this becoming next GILD and going under $150 soon.
Doesn't the earnings report come out today?
"if you want to sell, do it and get out of this chat"
