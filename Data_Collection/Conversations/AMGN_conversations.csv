"So, raise taxes on corporations and the rich just increases prices on products so middle class can pay their tax bill. Great idea Democrats! We lose!"
"They do have a diversified portfolio of drugs not just relying on 1-3 different products for their revenue. Also, the pipeline looks good. Please check it out here for yourselves: https://www.amgenpipeline.com/The R&D seems strong, just looks at how many drugs are waiting for FDA approval at the phase 3 level. Finances look healthy too with good cash flow and metrics look healthy as well. Don’t expect crazy growth, but I think we are about to go up from here slow and steady."
I like MRK and AMGN at these price points.Both are blue chip core holdings.
Waiting for $206
Key indicator for AMGN is MFI which has just started trending up. Big hands are starting to accumulate at these levels because combo of being fundamentally undervalued with a healthy dividend is a no brainer. Earnings coming on 11/2.
well...if the real issue is 3 billion in back taxes and 2 quarters of missing numbers I will wait until after earnings
Kinda wish I had sold all my AMGN and stuck with ABBV now. Own equal shares in both but this one has been the biggest disappointment.
Amgen appears to be a reasonable bet for dividends.
"""In today's overvalued market JNJ represents a satisfactory potential long-term investment for anyone comfortable with its risk profile. But AMGN represents as close to a perfect high-yield blue-chip investment as exists on Wall Street, with a far higher margin of safety, stronger risk-adjusted expected returns, and a superior yield (that's also very safe).""

You can get a higher (or equal) tax-free return in munis than 3.39%. Just saying....
One of the most undervalued stocks on the market. Accumulating.
"forward PE 11.70, this stock is severely undervalued, and for no reason"
"As tax-loss selling season approaches, AMGN will be under increasing downward pressure. I have been predicting a break to $200, but I'm revising that to $180-170. The 52-week low of $200.47 looks very vulnerable. Meanwhile, VTI continues to move higher (now $231.33)."
very weak stock action since last ER season stock may initially go down hard upon ER then rebound we shall see on 11/02
If you’re willing to hold this for a while you can add big on these short term down trends & make great income for a long time. Metrics are good.
"this dip can't be passed over, I'll add to my position"
Sub $200 after earnings will be when to buy
"I am not a bull or a bear on this stock but I am interested in hearing what people think will be a catalyst for the stock to move up??? Is it the pipeline? No significant ""new drug"" news to make the stock go up. Good dividend but that's not what I buy a stock for. We have had recent presentations at health care conferences.....but that has not inspired any analyst to upgrade. So what's gonna move the stock UP???"
"AMGN is off substantially more than the overall market, and there's no guarantee that AMGN will recover when the market recovers. That's a risk that you take with owning individual stocks. I've seen this scenario play out as long as I've been investing in stocks. Once-great companies eventually reach their pinnacle, and they may - or they may not - eventually recover to new highs. There's no guarantee that they might not someday begin a long downward slide into oblivion. It's all a huge gamble. The one thing that I can predict with a high degree of certainty is that the overall, broad market will eventually reach a new all-time high. Any individual stock - AMGN included - might, or it might not.That's why I stick to VTI. Look at GE. Look at PRD. Look at EK. There are hundreds of other examples I could name, but the only safe bet is something like VTI."
I became an investor by playing the chart.As it turns out it was not a good ideal but I do like its chances to make good money soon.
