"everybody you know CAKE lost .03 a share ?Total revenues were $627.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to $615.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Net loss available to common stockholders and diluted net loss per common share were $1.2 million and $0.03, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021."
"I went to my fav Thai restaurant yesterday and was talking to the owner and told him how much I missed coming in and sitting down.He told me they were not going to reopen as full service because the carryout business works a lot better and he make more moneyjust doing carryout .I find this very interesting and an angle I had not thought ofof all the restaurants I follow, CAKE is the one I think has the mostoverhead when they reopen, I site the gigantic menu and almost church like buildings that appear to be energy inefficient and expensive to maintaincould it be fancy in house dinning is going to be greatly reduced just as I feel a lot of work from home jobs will stay ?We may be entering a new age and CAKE could be like the dodo bird adapt or go extinct"
falling because offering??
"look out Both startup companies and well-established companies may opt to issue senior convertible notes to raise funds from investors. This type of company financing has the advantage of being fairly simple to execute. This means the process of issuing the notes is relatively inexpensive for companies and it allows them quicker access to investor funding.A downside to this quick access to investor funding is that companies may end up carrying excessive debt, which could push them into insolvency or bankruptcy. https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/THE-CHEESECAKE-FACTORY-IN-8657/news/The-Cheesecake-Factory-Incorporated-nbsp-Announces-Proposed-Offerings-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-35567295/"

"Casual dining restaurant chain The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE) is raising $475 million, but it's not going toward growing or operating the business. Rather, the company will use the money to simplify its stock structure. That's a lot of cash with little perceived benefit to common shareholders ...."

They just offered a $10 orders of $40 or more coupon on DoorDash. I wonder how well those takeout/delivery sales are doing.
Maybe I’ll just hold it and collect upwards of 16k from its old dividend for the rest of my life
Have no idea why CAKE increased that much that quickly but you all know it's a great company to own. Especially when it is discounted that much. I reduced my position by half though and buy some other undervalued stock. Well If CAKE goes down I'll buy heavily again it doesn't deserve below $30 imo
"Sorry guys , CAKE is not a buy for the following reasons right now: there is a possibility of class action lawsuits arising from the fine , 39 of the CAKE restaurants (20%) are located in California where covid is causing lockdowns , and the market is starting to look like a sell off may be on the way before long......"
"Earnings should greatly exceed the expectations of 75 cents per share. We already have all the data at our fingertips to determine that to be the case. According to Zacks, earnings of 75 cents per share would correspond to an increase of 186% above last year’s numbers. They are also expecting sales growth numbers to be 157 percent above last year’s figures. During the company news release from 06/02, CAKE reported that, through 05/31, this quarter’s sales growth was 196% above last years numbers, and this was with mandated average dinning capacity limits of 70% in place. By early June of this year, Covid restrictions had been lifted everywhere. Yet during June and July of last year, the restrictions were still being expanded everywhere. So I think it is reasonable to expect sales growth figures to be greatly above those of 2020."
And another reason I say this is heading to $10.....There is no way on earth they keep all these locations open. I'd be they close 15-20% of their locations that aren't performing well.And I've been saying for awhile now that the dividend is in jeopardy. They suspended it in today's earnings announcement.
"Just some information to consider:- 6% mortality from COVID+ cases- Roughly 5-6 million tests have been performed, mostly in high pre-test probability groups. That means we only know what the prevalence of the disease is in people with symptoms and not in the general stay-at-home population. We have no idea of how many more people can be infected and potentially overwhelm hospitals.- Even hospital workers such as myself are at risk of having our pay cut making things tighter- Yesterday's announcement of remdesivir relates to a treatement for people who have been infected and demonstrate moderate-to-severe symptoms. It has the ability to reduce hospitals stays and mortality. However, the evidence still remains in the air about its efficacy based on the journal Lancet. We STILL need more testing and a viable vaccine candidate not to mention the programs to actually roll this out into communities.- Flu season is also upon us. This will likely compound the chaos we've seen in hospitals and will serve as a deterrent in the sit-down restaurant space.- 30 MM people have filed for unemployement benefits across the country.- Furloughed restaurant workers may either never get to see their job back (and turn to Uber/Lyft or any other gigs) or go back with substantially less tips due to less volume (unlikely)What we saw yesterday was likely a fool's rally due to misinterpretation of just how dire the economic situation is out there and misunderstanding of the science behind things. People ARE hungry to get back to normal... and for-profit in a bearish economy.The recession is here. Just because your rebel overweight uncle carrying a ""give me liberty ($CAKE and a haircut) or give me death"" flag is making it on FOX and Georgia is treating its citizens like guinea pigs by opening up for businesses at unsafe speed does not mean we'll be getting to normalcy any time soon.Also, one thing that's been bugging me is the recent PE investment in Cheesecake Factory. PE is never just a bankroll. I think the very least we can say is that $CAKE will not come out this being the same destination restaurant it was before COVID."
Earnings call tomorrow. Good or bad for share price?
In since it was $15. FINALLY Doubled my money on this one!

"The Last Man Standing phenomena, where the survivors in business prosper after picking up sales from failed competitors will not benefit all businesses in the restaurant industry equally. In order to consider how CAKE might benefit, relative to its competitors, let’s consider situations left in the wake of COVID. It is discovered that a large Mexican restaurant with a popular bar has closed. It is close to a shopping mall. Would this be an opportunity for Shakeshack, Chipotle, Cracker Barrel, or even Darden? No not really. Only Chipotle has decent Mexican food in this example, and it is fast food, so it would not capture the bar sales. And it can be inferred that the patrons of this closed dinning establishment preferred causal dinning. For Cracker Barrel the menu is not right, and they usually gravitate toward locations that are close to interstate exits. It wouldn’t be a good opportunity for Darden because they don’t excel in Mexican cuisine. However, this would be a great opportunity for Cheesecake Factory because they have Blanco’s. A large Italian restaurant closed. It had great sales, but the owner did not want to try to keep it open during Covid. It is close to a mall that has a Cheesecake Factory and an Olive Garden is right down the road. CAKE is only major company that could take advantage of this situation. Darden is limited when comes to opening new Italian restaurants because Olive Gardens are already everywhere. CAKE has proven that you can place a North Italia right beside a Cheesecake Factory and the Cheesecake Factories sales will not be cannibalized. This is a situation that exists in Nashville. Both restaurants are thriving. Also, due to the large size and diversity of the Cheesecake Factory’s menu, a Cheesecake Factory could be launched anywhere a large, high volume restaurants closed. And many of these types of restaurants closed during COVID. Many Macaroni Grills closed, as did many of the Bravos restaurants. With the Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and the diverse offerings of the Fox Restaurants, no company in the casual dining sector has more to gain than CAKE in the post COVID competitive landscape. Darden is too big and too established to fully capitalize on the situation. Olive Gardens and Cheddars are already everywhere. But there is plenty of room for CAKE to grow with its new Fox Restaurants and its small market cap of less than 3 billion. CAKE is the kind of stock that can make long term holders quite wealthy in this environment. Imagine how much wealth their stock will generate long term now that over 90,000 of their competitors are gone. This situation offers the kind of earnings growth will send the stock price up way higher than most people realize. 200 more Blanco’s, 200 more North Italia’s, 200 more Flower Child Restaurants, hundreds more flag ship Cheesecake Factory restaurants could be on the way. Then consider the expansion opportunity from Social Monk, their fast food Asian Restaurant. Also, The Henry and The Arrogant Butcher restaurant will be popping up in various places. And all of this growth is coming from a company with a market cap under 3 billion dollars. Everyone needs to load up on this stock while it’s still cheap!!! It won’t be a sub 3 billion market cap company for long!"
is Cake doomed?!?!
Looks like we’re in the soup….
"Since the year 2005, there have been $1.38 million dollars worth of insider buys in AMZN. Since 2005, there have been over $36,000,000,000 of insider sells. Yet the stock price has gone up incredibly well. Insider sells mean nothing."
If you don’t invest now ... will regret later ... Cheesecake Factory is a strong company and iconic restaurant in USA
Is the price of CAKE supported by short squeez or vaccine news? what are the factors that cause CAKE to rise further?
"Insider selling, dilution of shares, COVID concerns, breaking below support....a real loser in the near term."
Today’s low of 45.40 was 30% correction form it’s high of 65 and change￼. I think it’s time for a reversal
"Physician here. Also, someone who started from very low socioeconomic status and now considered ""upper middle class"" or top 2% for whatever that's worth:(1) As a physician: if you think this pandemic is going to be short-term, you're absolutely wrong. COVID will continue to plague the population for months if not all through 2020 and into 2021 with a resurgence of infections in the US and abroad, people not following stay-at-home orders and increased infections in rural/suburban white America (they will run into the same issues with limited resources we have in larger cities if not more given how corporate/PE investment has all but gutted their hospital systems), potential virus mutations in the population leading to new infections, a year if not more before introduction/implementation of vaccine programs. Even if restaurants are opened up, most progressive people currently following recommendations will avoid going to dirty restaurants with their children even after $CAKE and others open... for months. (2) As a person from originally low socioeconomic status: I see a lot of people here who are COMPLETELY disconnected from what sort of cash-strapped life the blue-collar American lives like. Many of you here are middle class to upper-middle-class people who are used to eating at $CAKE. While YOU may think about going back given any disposable income you may still have, I can ASSURE you most blue-collar people won't. They're literally unemployed, broke, and losing their health insurance.(3) As an economist/investor: look at the evolving millenial-driven market and preferences. $CAKE is a boomer restaurant concept that is too bulky to actually function in the middle or long term. It will likely crash despite shedding operational costs. What do people in the 20-40 age range prefer? Local and fast-casual. Consider that while luxury retail spaces, where $CAKE functions (i.e., Simon Group), may outperform retail spaces in poorer communities, the whole concept of going to a mall to eat is REALLY outdated and becoming less popular. We can talk about financials for days, but this is the reality of $CAKE that requires a much more macroeconomic assessment."
"Looks like they will survive, but when will they be as profitable as they were?"
CAKE is down 7.29% to 51.00
"75% of people said that they would not go to a sporting event. If the same statistic applies to a restaurant, I don't see anyway that CAKE survives."
"The SEC order also finds that, although the March filing described actions the company had undertaken to preserve financial flexibility during the pandemic, it failed to disclose that The Cheesecake Factory had already informed its landlords that it would not pay rent in April due to the impacts that COVID-19 inflicted on its business.“When public companies describe for investors the impact of COVID-19 on their business, they must speak accurately,” said Stephanie Avakian, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement."
who is buying cheescake stocks during a pandemic at all time highs ? i might be missing something :)
80% revenue was intact for the stores that were allowed to remain open. Considering mall traffic was down drastically that’s very impressive. If the stock takes a dive in the early hours tomorrow I’m averaging up.
"Good buying opportunity here. You know there is a 100% chance that they are going to blow away earnings with California increasing seating capacity in restaurants. And this company isn’t like tech, where someone can come along and invent a new chip, a new piece of software, or violate your patents making your company obsolete and unprofitable. Cheesecake has been loved for over 4000 years, and it will not become obsolete anytime soon. CAKE just needs to keep doing what they do so well, and the stock price will continue to rise. If they keep making the best food in causal dinning, if they keep opening new Cheesecake Factories, and if they continue to expand the Fox Restaurant concepts locations, this stock could be a 10 bagger in 5 to 10 years, even starting now at around 60. Covid killed off a lot of competition. It’s smooth sailing from now on out."
this stock is almost doubled pre-covid levels... the recovery is always much slower then the fall.... restaurants are now just starting to open up again... im getting out before the correction...
"The big money and potential for cheese cake factory is when they start to export they new ice cream all over the world, they already export frozen cakes and have restaurants in many countries and everyone know that brand https://www.cakecareers.com/page/show/international"
"This is the second dine in restaurant with significant floor space that I bought in today. Call me crazy but I am an optimist. The brand is strong, the current pe, market cap is much better than before. Institutional ownership is over 100% and Roark Private Equity, the owners of many restaurant brands bought into it. They have made money for me with WING and I like their seasoned management. ER is in a couple of days and I expect numbers to be bad for a couple of quarters. God Bless and stay well."
"Corp Greed using company money to buy back insider granted sharesOur objectives with regard to share repurchases have been to offset the dilution to our shares outstanding that results from equity compensation grants and to supplement our earnings per share growth. Our share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date, does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time.Share buy backs are a scam to drain money from the share holders As Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer at CHEESECAKE FACTORY INC, David Overton made $6,715,889 in total compensation. Of this total $995,000 was received as a salary, $1,094,500 was received as a bonus, $1,090,506 was received in stock options, $3,272,733 was awarded as stock and $263,150 came from other types of compensation. This information is according to proxy statements filed for the 2019 fiscal year.I wonder how much they got in dec 2020 ? good way to hide the moneyfrom investors that they got big pay in 2020 while employees were out of work"
"Math for Shorties.Yes, it all about growth. In that respect you are correct. And the old post about the earnings report is well known and nothing new (COVID-CA shut down during that quarter). So, I think the salient question for those considering CAKE as a possible position is why the stock rose during the last, short term NASDAQ correction? Two other great questions are also: why is the institutional ownership so high, 98%? And why did the stock surge after the Raymond James Investors Conference for institutional investors? CAKE presented at that conference. If you are right, then perhaps these people are wrong. Or perhaps they might be seeing something that you might be missing. In the related news under CAKE on this site, you can find an article that has the title: Is it time to consider buying CAKE? The piece is not favorable to CAKE, but that’s fine. You should have seen the ones about the company when the stock was $18.00 per share. It’s strange, but they often only start loving a stock after it more than triples in price. Though this piece is not flattering, it is useful because it contains the answer to the three questions that I mentioned. If you click on the 4 warning signs for the stock, you will see the growth rate for CAKE that has caused all the institutions to start buying it like crazy. This rate is 67% for the next 3 years. The big money knows that a growth rate such as this will evaporate all other problems. So this year if CAKE makes 100% in sales, in one year it makes 167% more. After year two it makes 278% more, and after year three this amount is 465%. This is why CAKE keep going up. Those with access to the most information (the institutions) are accumulating this stock. But, I don’t just take anyone’s word for a company’s prospects. I’ve tried some of the restaurants that come with the FOX acquisition, and they are quite wonderful. They put a North Italia right beside the Cheesecake Factory at the upscale Mall at Greenhills in Nashville. Now both restaurants are packed. Short this company if you want, but be warned. A stock with a compelling growth story, 98% institutional ownership, 7% insider ownership, and retail owners who are committed to the future can go up quickly. I could see CAKE going up 10 points in a day. The float is that small."
Restaurants all returning to full capacity........not a time to cut and run from CAKE.........
next short squeeze?
"It’s funny. The whole Nasdaq has been crashing, and out of all the fluff and lofty valuations out there, people pick this stock to short. It has a tiny float, huge institutional ownership, and massive big block buys following the Raymond James Institutional Investor conference where they where they presented their growth plans. During Covid they opened several new restaurants. They are now opening new restaurants from their Fox Restaurants Concept acquisition. Three of these restaurants are now in Nashville: North Italia, Blanco, and True Food Kitchen. And these 3 are quite popular. Flower Child is another popular restaurant that came from the Fox acquisition. What all of these Fox restaurants have in common is that they all are incredibly popular everywhere they are launched, and right now, there are only about 24 of each of them nationally. Plans are for there to ultimately be about 200 of North Italia, and Flower Child. And Blanco and several of the other Fox Restaurants will have similar total counts nationally when the dust settles. This stock is holding up fairly well because many of the people who bought it really low are not interested in locking in long term capital gains right now. This company has come through COVID and faces an environment of less competition. A good example for what will be happening all over this country can be found in Birmingham, Alabama. Covid caused a Romano’s Macaroni Grill to close. Cheesecake Factory has just opened a North Italia right there. If you want to short this stock now, go right ahead. The shorts have been dogging it the whole way up. As for me, I’ll sit back and let the money roll in as more people discover this gem of a stock. It’s like a tiny little Darden Restaurants with a market cap barely above 2 billion and much better food offerings. Give yourself a break. If you shorted recently run for the hills. This one could jump $10 to $15 in a day if the shorts pour in. Yes, the float is that small. Then do some research. Look up the restaurants coming with the Fox merger. Look at their ratings. Go try them. Then the stock’s resilience will no longer be a mystery. Go long. Get wealthy. Five years to a 10 bagger from here. The big money knows this already."
"will drop to high 40,s"
This Is a funny stock. Traded it for a quick play but starting to look like it may be a buy later this week if it keeps dropping. Any indication of how their takeout business is doing from long term holders? Trying to time an entry point for a bounce
wow this is the short of a lifetime
"from the 10K of CAKE for those who have eyes to see and brains to discernon May 1, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the ""Amendment"") to our Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated July 30, 2019 (as amended by the Amendment, the ""Amended Facility""), that, among other changes, provides for net adjusted leverage ratio and EBITDAR to interest and rent expense coverage ratio covenant relief through the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Following the end of the covenant relief period, a material increase in our level of debt could cause our net adjusted leverage ratio and EBITDAR to interest and rent expense coverage ratios to be outside of permitted levels under the covenants in the Amended Facility. (See Item 1A - Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - ""Any failure to satisfy financial covenants and/or repayment requirements under our credit facility could harm our financial condition."") To further increase our liquidity given the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, we issued 200,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on April 20, 2020 for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million.does this really seem like a safe investment ?"
The stock is so undervalued it’s going to absolutely skyrocket in the next month
this stock isnt worth the headache

cake got 16million shares shorted. I wouldn't hold short position through the earnings.
Pelosi is not helping CAKE…….with the big concentration in California……….
Also revenue of 627 million this quarter when operating at 60% occupancy should translate to revenue of 1.05 billion at 100 occupancy. They generated 21.8 million in cash flow for the quarter to lift their cash on hand to 181 million. Now coming out of Covid they have liquidity of around 300 million. Things look good. This will be the weakest quarter they will have going forth.
"""Hotel room occupancy in Central Florida plummeted 75% during the third week in March compared with last year, a new report shows"""
CAKE is down 6.02% to 46.85
"$CAKE and $PLAY are EXCELLENT buys right now, believe me folks, you will regret it if you don’t. They are heading up!"
Apparently there is a rumor going around that $CAKE just told the landlords that they can’t pay April rent? Anyone else hear this going around?
"I’m sorry Steve, but I think you’ve picked the wrong stock to short. These vaccines are the real deal. Millions of vials are ready to be shipped. Another bad month of Covid is no big deal. If you are going to invest, it makes no sense to wait until everything is back to normal because your gains will be less. The end of Covid is now in sight. The whole world is ready to celebrate. Soon the theaters and restaurants will be full, and with the obesity epidemic in America, you can bet a whole lot of people will want cheesecake. Now with less competition left, the launch of new North Italia and Flower Child restaurants will be faster. Both of these restaurants are very good, and there is now less than 30 of each of them. What do you think sales for CAKE will be like in 10 years when they have 120 of each restaurant and many more Cheesecake Factories?This stock will be huge over the long term."
so far great bounce back after going down on earnings. Good sign moving forward as it closes in on 30 
Cheesecake restaurant here in Washington State is booming... not sure about other state tho? Bullish still price target $45
"Looking ahead, given that the operating environment continues to be very dynamic, we want to keep you updated on our underlying expectations for 2021. Following the benign commodity inflation we experienced in the first half of the year, we currently expect total cost of sales inflation of approximately 3% for the back half of the year. Given the normal seasonal sales trends for the Cheesecake Factory restaurants and FRC, coupled with anticipated wage inflation in line with our prior commentary, we believe the labor line could deleverage by up to 25 basis points in the back half of the year from the second quarter level. With regard to other operating expenses, we spend the second half of the year, on average, to be slightly higher than the second quarter on a percent of sales basis as we take the opportunity given the sales strength to reinvest in the business and fund costs associated with the rewards program building. We currently have 3% pricing in the Cheesecake Factory menu and plan to remain at that level for the second half of the year. We believe this is sufficient to cover the inflationary factors currently contemplated."
I will say after seeing GS blow out earnings high est was 12 bucks a shareand they made 18 ... and yet the stock has hardly moved ????so CAKE will earn 0.00 and jump to 70 bucks ...how can anyone trade this market ?
Deutsch Bank and Piper Sandler are the only two houses that actually lifted target above current stock price
"Just came back from Waikiki Beach, Oahu/ the Cheesecake Factory is packed over there/ the food is great, always fresh and delicious.The reason above why I bought this stock!"

"In addition, our increased indebtedness related to the Acquisition and our resulting higher debt-to-equity ratio, as compared to that which has existed on a historical basis, could limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and have other material consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility in planning for, changing business and market conditions, making us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to use proceeds from any offering or divestiture transaction for purposes other than the repayment of debt; and, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness.you guys really need to read the 10K I would buy the preferred A stock and sell the commonhttps://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000110465921027547/cake-20201229x10k.htm"
"Cheesecake Factory is a guilty pleasure for me. But I think for a lot of people it's more of a regular thing. I live near one and it's usually packed and you always see people waiting outside, even on the weekdays. They also do a lot of takeout business even after Covid. I park in the lot next door quite often and see they are still using the reserved spots for pickup. Where I am business looks better than it did pre pandemic."
Spent a bunch at Cheesecake Factory in Nashville yesterday. Good to see some traffic in the store.
Inflation and delta will send this back into the $25 range. Stop loss at $40 which should hit in the next day or so.
Last time I ate here I got a nasty case of the Chicago Blowouts
here comes the jeremy effect
Looks like toast until COVID numbers start to improve……
"I SHORT CAKE AT 62, I'LL HOLD IT FOR A YEAR"
"At a stock price of $100.00 per share, CAKE’s market cap would be about 4.5 billion, which would be less than Shake-shack’s is currently."
"So if this company can earn $0.80, this past quarter, even though as of 05/31, on average, it was operating at 70% dinning capacity, what will its earnings be like next quarter when it will have been operating without restrictions for the entire quarter? And if they can, let’s say 90 cents per share for the next 4 quarters that would give them 90+90+90+90=$3.60 per share for the next year. If the stock were to stay around $50.00 that would give them a PE ratio of 50/3.50 or 13.9. Right now the average PE ratio of the SP500 is 33.4. So I think it’s hard to argue that CAKE is over valued. I also think that this company is going to see earnings growth over the next 10 years that will probably be more than the 8 percent same store growth they saw above 2019 levels. This year they are opening 14 new locations. I’m sure in the coming years they will increase the rate of new openings. The Fox restaurants alone: North Italia, Flower Child, and Blancos will add hundreds of new restaurants. So even if you are conservative and expect 8% earnings growth above the $3.60 yearly estimate compounded for 10 years, you would arrive at a $7.77 per share at the end of 10 years. At a PE ratio of 15, the stock would be trading at 116, and at a PE ratio of 233. Up the growth rate to a compounded 10% for 10 years, and the company would have earnings of $9.32 per share. Then a PE ratio of 15 would correspond to a share price of $140, and a PE ratio of 30 would represent a share price of $280. I personally think that with everything this company has going for it in the form of international partnerships, new Cheesecake Factory launches domestically, new Fox Restaurant Concept launches, other expansions, Social Monk, I think that they might be able to grow earnings by 15% per year. If that happens, in ten years a PE ratio of 15 would correspond to a share price of about $220, and a PE ratio of 30 would correspond to a share price of about $440. Of course a PE ratio that is near the current average of the SP 500 would correspond to a share price right around $500.00. Now imagine what will happen when they bring the dividend back. I think I’ll stay long."
I still say it is a $10 stock. JCP/Sears/Macys either bankrupt or nearly. Nordstroms struggling. Gap is always struggling. Vic Secret struggling. Ann Taylor bankrupt today. Brooks Brothers bankrupt. There is just nothing to like about anything mall-related right now. This take-out cheesecake strategy....that's a band aid for this company.Earnings will sound rosy next week. But it is just a matter of time before there is either a huge chunk of US that is closed or the whole thing. Probably won't crater to $10 overnight. But I think it will steadily make its way down there by beginning of 2021.

"I’m in big with Cake.. at 15% of my portfolio. About the best recovery restaurant stock I could find. Bought at about 23 so I’m pretty satisfied right now. Is anybody in the same boat as I am I’ve been in the market almost 3 years and this point in history seems like the pivotal time to make enough money to really set my financial future up. The risk reward seems compelling, I rotated out of big tech into beaten down plays like cake, other restaurants, hotels, resorts, airlines while being selective of the companies. It could go south but I believe I’ll be alright in the long run "
"I read once that Peter Lynch, the Manager at the Fidelity Magellan Fund, had over 100 ten baggers during his tenure at the fund from 1979 to 1991. His performance during that time was legendary. He had an average compounded return of over 29%. He once said that often when he selected a stock that he believed was going to do really great immediately, he would later discover that it would do even better in 2 to 3. Mr. Lynch look for stocks that offered the possibility for outstanding growth. I believe that CAKE can be a 10 bagger because they have so many ways in which they can grow. The restaurants acquired from the Fox purchase give them an unlimited potential for growth. In a decade, CAKE could be 10 times the size they are now. They could be a Darden with better food offerings."
this is a case of a great company terrible stock. never been to an unbusy cheesecake factory
Cheesecake Factory is up 8.59% to 33.10
Is Cheesecake running out of cash? Why sink like a rock?
"When 100,000 restaurants have closed due to Covid, when interest rates are at historic lows, when you have nearly a dozen types of unique restaurants that you want to launch in high numbers, debt is good, and CAKE needs more of it-not less. Even Walmart has 42 billion in debt."

"My friend is the GM at a cheesecake location in south Florida. Weekly sales pre-covid/week about 230k.Weekly sales post covid/week about 150k (just take out) He said that there are talks of opening doors end of May beginning of June. He mentioned they would start at 10% capacity and work to 20% 30% and so on. They expect 35k in sales on Mother’s Day alone at this location just take out. They are moving tables 6ft apart, using folded silverware instead of silverware on napkins. Salt packets instead of table salt. ALL employees are going to be required to wear masks. I think this sentiment will be displayed in the upcoming earnings in 5 days. Treatments are getting better results than expected closer to a vaccine is not going to reach mortality rate as we thought. I think we have seen the bottom in March and as things start to open they’ll be ready"
"Dav, there are a hundred reasons why CAKE is thriving and above pre-pandemic levels. Here are a few:1.) One of the reasons they dropped pre-pandemic was due to the acquisition of North Italia and Flower Child restaurants and the expense involved. Now those restaurants have been assimilated and they are powerful engines for growth. There are only about 25 of each of these restaurants, and every place where you find a Cheesecake Factory today, you will some day find these two restaurants. In Nashville, at the upscale Mall at Greenhills, North Italia is right beside the Cheesecake Factory, and they both are busy.2.)North Italia is really, really good. They make their own pasta. It’s incredible. And from what I understand (I haven’t eaten there), Flower Child is great.3.)There are fewer competitors after covid, and subsequently, more opportunities to fill in the niches left behind.4.)A new Asian restaurant they launched, Social Monk, falls in the fast food niche. They are testing one location now in California. If they work out, there will probably be many. There are 1600 Panda Express restaurants in the US, so a better quality, Asian Restaurant would have many opportunities. Panda Express is not publicly traded. 5.)Cheesecake Factory will be opening several new restaurants domestically this year. I think they said 12-15. So growth will be strong with the flagship restaurant.6.)They just opened their first Cheesecake Factory in Mexico. That country could support several restaurants.7.)They only have a few restaurants in Europe. They will open several more.8.)COVID is winding down. The vaccine is working. The company has become much more efficient as they worked through it. Lots more curb side and delivery service and better utilization of technology.9.)There is much pent up demand in this economy. People want things to go back to normal. They want to go back to the malls, and they want to eat out more.10.)Stimulus money. This economy has had so much money pumped into it that a consumer retail spending binge is inevitable, and Cheesecake Factory will benefit.11.)The fact that CAKE is trading above pre-pandemic levels is not unusual for the restaurant sector. Check out Shake-shack , Dave and Busters, and Ruth Chris. They are above pre-pandemic highs or very close. In the case of Dave and Busters, it has run from around $4.00 (pandemic low) to around $40.00. 12.)Institutional ownership of CAKE is around 93%. Do you think they might know something?13.)Due to the high level of institutional ownership and insider ownership, this stock has a small float, and if anyone is foolish enough to short it, they deserve what they will get. The stock could soar very quickly.14.)The company is well run. 15.)They still have lots of cash on hand to facilitate their plans for growth. 16.)Chipotle is trading at nearly $1500.00 a share. Could Social Monk, one day, be an Asian restaurant version of Chipotle?"
"All these restaurants will survive. The landlords will work a deal as they won’t find a new tenant anyway. Landlords won’t want to start a new concept when it’s not the concept that does at work it’s the entire economy. They have zero employee costs , zero rent and zero food cost. Those are the major costs in food and beverage. I see all these stocks trading at double within a year or two maximum."
"This is a good buying opportunity. The next quarter earnings will be incredible, and the third and fourth quarters will even be better! Remember, the update at the beginning of June? Same store sales were up 197% over the previous year despite the fact that the average restaurant was operating at 70% capacity. Since that time most restaurants have been operating with no restrictions. Also, the new Fox Restaurants are doing very good, especially North Italia, Flower Child, and Blancos. The new Fox Restaurants will insure amazing growth for the next decade."

"Just a few thoughts. This stock and the entire restaurant sector is down on fears of a coming return to lockdown conditions. Yet, currently no lock downs are in place. Just the mask mandates. Yet, you are allowed to eat with your mask down. If we are currently in a situation where there are no lockdowns, why do people still suspect that they are coming? This Delta strain of Covid has built a fire under much of the population that previously were reluctant to become vaccinated to the extent that now they say that over 90% of the population that is over 65 years of age have received their first vaccination and that over 70% of the US population has received their first shot. Right now the biggest group that is unvaccinated is the 12 to 18 year age range. Generally this group is unharmed by covid, so there hasn’t been a huge push to get them vaccinated. While I am well aware that some people who are vaccinated develop the delta strain of covid, I am also quite aware that generally this is quite rare and that when it does occur 90% of the time the case is mild. And when you combine those who are vaccinated with those who have had Covid and recovered, there will be very few people left within the next month that can even become infected with serious disease. Right now CAKE locations are packed full with diners, and there are no dining restrictions in place, and there are unlikely to be any new restrictions. Despite the fact that for the first part of the last quarter (up to 07/31) CAKE was operating at a dinning capacity average of 70%, they earned 80 cents per share adjusted. For this current quarter there have been no restrictions, so to me this stock is starting to look ridiculously cheap. If they were only to match last quarters number of 80 cents per share for the next 4 quarters, they would earn $3.20 per share. $44.00/$3.20 is a PE ratio of 13.75. The overall PE ratio of the SP500 is around 33. And, that 80 cent per share number comes in a quarter when, on average, they were operating at a capacity limit of 70 percent. The company’s PE ratio when fully operating (like right now) is likely much lower. Buy here. Hold for 10 years for the expansion of new Cheesecake Factories, North Italias, Blancos, and Flower Child Restaurants, and you will make a fortune."
@Julian....you looking at #CAKE direction today?....exit restaurant space and reenter in 10 calendar days on stock we talked about.

Ordered takeout from my local Cheesecake Factory spoke to the employees and they said they were extremely busy especially at dinner hours. There were 20 cars in the pickup spots waiting for food to come out. Sounds like they are going to be just fine even if social distancing is a problem.
"Considering how popular cake is I might hold this position longer than expected. I will hold longer than a year because cake has ability to grow through north italia and other brands, ￼competition restaurants closing due to not having the funding that cake has, possible inflation could effect our nation. Imo this stock could still more than double in the near future even at this point."
"Hurricane Powell rumbled a little today scaring a few people away. From the beach. But each time the beach sand washes away due to the wind and the rain of the storm, it’s easier to find the golden doubloons. I think I’ll pick some up. There’s a lot of gold yet to come. CAKE has a bright future."
"If you have a time horizon 2-3 years, this stock will be $35-40 easy. Collect nice dividends along the way."
The public loves to eat at CAKE. Just a matter of a little bit of time before this stock returns to its highs !!
24 months from now 100% gain patience will be rewarded good entry imo.

"Short of a lifetime? This company opened new restaurants during the pandemic. They are launching an aggressive growth strategy involving the opening of several Fox Restaurant names, North Italia and Flowerchild to name a few. They may be expanding their fast food Asian restaurant Social Monk nationally. Every place where you see a Panda Express would prefer a Social Monk restaurant. There are currently 1600 Panda Express restaurants in the USA, so there is a viable market out, and there are very few publicly traded companies in that niche. There are about 25 North Italia’s and a similar number of Flowerchild restaurants currently in the US. Plans are for there to be around 200 of each one eventually. There are many other thriving restaurants acquired in the Fox purchase that will be opened by the Cheesecake Factory over the coming years. Also, internal expansion will be accelerating. Now the COVID vaccine is eradicating the disease and states are lifting restrictions. There is a great desire in the population for things to return to normal, and this will be manifested in a greater sales for the things that the public remembers with nostalgia, like eating out, mask free, with your friends and family and seeing movies in theaters. Now the economy is recovering and consumers have stimulus money. Do you think they might spend it eating out? Now there are fewer restaurants out there due to the effects of COVID, so sales among the surviving ones would likely increase even without stimulus money. This stock has greater than 93% institutional ownership, and it began to soar after the recent Raymond James investors conference. Be my guest, short this stock, and you might make buck or two on a sporadic basis, but if you hold it for several years, you’ll insanely wealthy. A stock that combines great economic timing, great corporate vision, a dynamic new merger, and the potential for incredible sustained growth on multiple fronts is quite rare, and when you find one, you need to back up the truck and load up all you can. Then just enjoy life while your wealth piles up. But make no mistake, the bones of a lot of shorts line this stock’s road to ascension. Go long. Get wealthy, and then buy a very nice Tesla!"
will settle back to high 40's
"This is an over reaction. Should CAKE seek to raise capital? YES! In the wake of Covid, 100,000 restaurants are gone! Now that Covid is gone there is a massive increase in demand for restaurant dining and a reduced supply of restaurants. This imbalance will be a short term problem. The companies that can afford to expand will prosper, as they open new locations. This is the time when it is wise to take on debt, if you are a restaurant. Now is not the time to try to expand with existing cash flow because time is of the essence. They need to open as many new locations as possible before their competitors expand their operations. Right now CAKE has a tremendous opportunity to open many new Cheesecake Factories, and they have several restaurants from the Fox Restaurant Concept merger that need to be launched ASAP. They see the national potential for Blanco, North Italia, and Flower Child. There are only around 10 Blancos in the US. There are only around 25 North Italias and about that many Flower Child Restaurants in the US. They intend to ultimately have around 200 North Italias, and approximately that many Flowerchild restaurants. They have mentioned aggressively launching many more Blancos. Now is not the time to be conservative. I support this decision."
CAKE is one of the few in its industry that IS surviving. Balance sheet is strong enough.
will have to watch CMG stock today so far down in the aftermarket even though they beat earnings they were another overpriced stock that needed a real earning blow out.I would really be nervous to hold CAKE thru earnings

"Alert set for 40. This company is doing too much.. recipes are weak, menus are too big, staff training is poor, too many stores and too many brands"
Cheesecake Factory reached a 52 Week low at 33.22
"Just imagine how much CAKE is going up, when those who are selling just because they want to lock in their huge long term capital gains quit doing so. Soon those people will stop selling. This stock will richly reward shareholders over the coming years. It’s still early. Over 90,000 restaurants and bars will not be reopening due to COVID. With all the new Fox offerings no other company is in a better position to capitalize on the billions of dollars in new sales that these COVID closures potentially offer. Cheesecake Factory, Blancos, North Italia, and Flower Child, and all of the other Fox Restaurants to fill in the void. Go long. Support the recovery. Become wealthier on the rise."

Who is Jeremy?
"I used to work for this company and can attest that this company is a great solid business. Great quality control, cooks, staff. It’s very well run. I once asked the manager how their profits were doing post covid. He said they make a ton of money. I shorted this stock during the pandemic and profited on and if it wasn’t for me moving most of my capital to shorting stocks/day trading I’d invest long term in this company. This stock/company can only go up. Great investment!"
"Relatively new to the thread. Wow, I read a lot of negative posts here. I was totally negative on big floor space restaurant myself even though I did not buy or short any. I did get in on TACO after I notice a line at the drive thru, a location which was inside a gas station. I figured they would survive the pandemic so I put some money in about a month ago and did very well. I finally changed my mind on CAKE and BJRI when I picked up curbside ant BJRI and it was happening at curbside as well as walk in take out because I had believed that the disruption would be a 100% zero revenue. These restaurants with resources have adapted their business model and even though stock prices have moved off their bottom, I believe at 50% off their highs, there is mid to longer term value. God Bless and stay well all."
Delta will continue to be a drag on cake for months to come….
How about a take out by Roark Capital? I know they made out like bandits on the preferred shares. They haven't been shy about buying up quality restaurant stocks.
"Reasons why you want to own this stock going into the next earnings report: On June 2, CAKE released an update on sales from the end of the first quarter through May 31st. They reported that same store sales were up 196% above the prior year. They also reported that these numbers reflect an average restaurant seating capacity of 70% occupancy. They also reported that now off site purchases account for over 30% of sales. During the first quarter they reported earnings that exceeded estimates by a large amount despite the fact that California had a shelter in place order in effect for part of that quarter, and for the remainder of that quarter they had seating capacity limited to 25% for BOTH indoor and outdoor seating. Cheesecake Factory has 39 restaurants in California. Which means that a little less than 20% of their restaurants are located in California. Restrictions have been lightening in California for several weeks now, and are completely gone tomorrow. So when you consider all of these factors, what do you think is going to happen to the next quarters earnings? Now all locations are operating without restrictions. The next quarters earnings will be amazing, and the Christmas quarter will even be better. Some shorts have mentioned possible increases in cost being a potential problem, but inflationary issues are not much of an issue for this company for several reasons. I will mention two. First, most of their employees are servers: waiters and waitresses. Any increase in minimum wage will not affect CAKE because their severs already average around $15.00 per hour in company pay, and with tips they average $30 to $40 dollars per hour. This is why CAKE always rates as being on of the best companies in the US to work for. Second: If the price of materials, meats and vegetables, etc. goes up, it should be obvious that any restaurant that has wait times of 1.5 to 2.0 hours has pricing power if they need to adjust menu pricing. Reasons to hold and buy more shares even past the next two quarters. They have reduced competition (100,000 restaurants are gone due to covid), and have many new restaurants they are opening from their Fox acquisition branch: Blancos, North Italia, Flower Child, etc. These are not normal, run of the mill restaurants. These Fox Restaurants can be opened anywhere because they will completely destroy their competitors. And there are only a few of them! This means that CAKE is going to experience high sales growth for over a decade at least! This company has all of the traits of a company that can produce amazing share appreciation. So what if the tiny float goes up a small amount."

We closed at the low of the day today. I’m expecting further downside coming as the news is all about the new mask mandate and the delta variant. Sentiment in the food sector is not good at the moment due to all the negativity. I am expecting cake to move under $40 in the coming days.

52 week high is over $45. Sad to see some of these great restaurant concerns stock price being cut in half. My average buy-in price is 27.18 so sadly I'm sitting on a loss of 17%. I just hope CAKE can weather this storm. Saw where Norwegian Cruise Lines announced issuance of $250 million in new common shares. I hope CAKE doesn't lean this way. Scary times.
Its only been a couple of weeks since lock down and already they cant pay rent? How is that even believable?
This stock will 100% be at 40$ in 2-3 years get in or miss the gain train
I am going to buy cheesecake and BJ's but I prefer to wait til after earnings. both are great 2 year longs. could def double
what's up with the sell off? not in on this stock but following restaurant recovery and this seems like a bit much
"With respect to any shareholders lawsuits stemming from the SEC fine, what damages will the plaintiffs show? The SEC said that Cheesecake Factory made things at the company sound better than they really were at that time. So presumably shareholders might not sale. But since that time, the stock has nearly doubled. Has anyone been hurt?"
"As of today (2021-04-22), Cheesecake Factory's share price is $57.610000. Cheesecake Factory's GF Value is $40.93. Therefore, Cheesecake Factory's Price-to-GF-Value for today is 1.41.Based on the relationship between the current stock price and the GF Value, GuruFocus believes Cheesecake Factory is Significantly Overvalued.https://www.gurufocus.com/term/gf_value/NAS:CAKE/GF-Value/Cheesecake-Factory"
I'm curious to see what happened cash flow wise once the 10k comes out. So they have 250 million right now which is plenty. Will be curious to see what is happening to the cash flows before buying back into this one. I think going forward it will be all about the cash flows. Reopening also means more costs as well. Typically a restaurant has to be 80% full to break even. Maybe not Cake but that is an average. As someone who likes eating their on occasion and someone who wants to see the US come back I'm glad they have been able to get the necessary financing to get them through this. I think as we enter the fourth quarter COVID will finally start to wane a bit. It just has to run its course like all viruses.
It all my time of trading stock this is a brutal drop after positive earnings. Even if they would have doubled their eps it wouldn?t have jumped 13% that?s why holding and buy prior to earnings is a joke. I?m long with cake so at this point I?m not bothered but it #$%$ me off. Now if they reinstate their dividend watch this fly high it?s a fickle B
Boom!
Stocks with no reason to run up are screaming. Cake has a legit story and all that money sitting on the side lines is looking for a home.This was lagging behind hence a value now with the positive news. $35 by mid next week easy.
I am predicting that even if CAKE mets earnings with .75 a share the stock will still sell off.If they can pull a Buck then yes they will go back to 60.but I predict CAKE goes back to 50 after earnings.
I don't know what's happening but I'm enjoying this climb

"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated CAKE may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cheesecake Factory is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CAKE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 85 cents per share for CAKE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.07 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CAKE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +21.21% heading into earnings season.https://www.google.ca/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/why-earnings-season-could-great-123112294.html"
"One of the really big strengths that CAKE has that few people are grasping is the opportunities presented by their acquisition of Fox Restaurant Concepts. Most people still think of CAKE as being entirely the Cheesecake Factory, when that is not the case anymore. By now everyone is familiar with the Cheesecake Factory. In most places they are the causal dinning restaurant with the most devoted fans and longest lines. When one runs down a list of the best possible restaurants in most places, they are always at the top of the list, and in places where there is no Cheesecake Factory, it becomes obvious that if one were to open in those places, they would thrive at the expense of all of the other, inferior restaurants. So now, there is another threat from Covid and mask mandates have returned in many places so the shares of CAKE have sold off. Yet, as more people become immunized the threat of mass closures becomes remote, and during this quarter seating capacity restrictions have not been implemented in many places. To me, it seems important to remember that during the last quarter, CAKE reported strong sales and profits, even though, through May 31st, they were operating at an average seating capacity of 70%. So right now, things look pretty good for the company. As many of you have noticed, the restaurants are quite crowded. The vaccinated, for the most part, are not fearful of public commerce because they know that chances are that even if they contract covid, the case is usually mild. So with the heavy traffic flow, no seating capacity restrictions in most places, and the pandemic winding down, the stock is cheap when one calculates any kind of forward PE ratio and compares it too the average PE ratio of the S&P500. For the next 4 quarters they might earn around 80 cents per share. If you multiply that figure x4 you would calculate earnings of $3.20 per year. Divide that into $44.00, the current share price, and you get a PE ratio of 13.75. The current PE ratio of the S&P500 is 35.05. Now that should be enough to appeal to most investors as they discover this fact. Yet, the compelling valuation mentioned here is only part of CAKE’s appeal. All companies want to grow, but growth is not that easy when a company has already saturated a given market with their locations. Right now the future for restaurants has never looked better for expansion because over 100,000 restaurants and bars are gone due to covid. So, the survivors have the potential to really cash in if they execute well. And to me it seems that the very best scenario would be to own stock in a company that has superior restaurants that dominate the competition yet have few locations. For example, even if a company like Darden wanted to open several new Olive Gardens, the possible locations for this restaurant would be limited because many hundred of them are located all over this country. Any place where CAKE were to choose to open a Cheesecake Factory would work out because they are generally the first choice in casual dinning. Compare the lines if you don’t believe me. Yet CAKE also has the incredible Fox Restaurant Concept offerings. The 3 biggest of these are North Italia, Flower Child, and Blancos. Each of these three are amazing restaurants, and they are dominating every place they are launched. Yet, right now there are only a little more that 25 North Italias and Flower Child restaurants in this country. And only about 10 Blancos nationwide. The company has actually mentioned eventually having a nationwide North Italia and Flower Child restaurant count of over 200 each! And they could easily launch 200 to 300 Blancos in this country. The new North Italias (2) and the Blancos in Nashville are major hits. I’ve having seen this first hand. So at this point in time, in addition to being a compelling value opportunity, the shares of CAKE seem to offers exceptional growth prospects for at least a decade! Buy it now, and in 10 years, I think you will be amazed by how much wealth you have accumulated. CAKE offers a simple model for shareholder wealth growth: Continue to deliver the high quality food and atmosphere that customers expect from the Cheesecake Factory, and expand into markets to new markets that need new locations. You don’t have to worry about someone making a new type of computer chip that makes your company’s tech obsolete or some company violating your company’s patents. Just buy this stock and let it cruise for a few years. No one will make good food obsolete."
This was a 45 dollar stock prior to covid. Lots of upside from here. Not a matter of if just when. A rare value in this over bought market. I can wait a few quarters of improvement to see a 60% return. GREAT VALUE!
Why did CAKE jump 7%+ after hours today?

Has anyone visited a Cheesecake Factory restaurant during this pandemic? The place always has a waiting list for a table.
going back to 45
Has CAKE announced any plans to re-start dividend payments?
"Let's hit the pause button for a second. Realistically, how likely is this company to get out of the mire created not only by overinflated asset prices prior to the COVID crisis but the current social distancing climate and probable long-lived recession environment. I think about the consumer when it comes to assessing moderate and long term growth.Massive furloughs, pay decreases, record unemployment rates (already the surface level low pre-COVID unemployment rate was dubious as a marker of financial/retail health - think Uber/Lyft jobs) will plague and continue to plague the average consumer for the foreseeable future. How about rent freezes, which are not rent forgiveness and something these same average consumers will have to catch up on?AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHEESECAKE? A NEW LINE OF TAKEOUT BEER/WINE? WITH NEGATIVE DISPOSABLE INCOME? COOOOME OOOOON? Let's stop kidding ourselves here. Budlight and Kroger line ice cream will be in America's refrigerators. Forget about family outings to CAKE. Factor in new societal trends represented by growing personal fitness and online services (e.g., gaming) sectors with these stay at home advisories as well as us going into spring and it's hard to make a cause for the average consumer dishing out $80+ for a family of four, at a crowded restaurant, with mortgages/rents to catch up on, and a nascent interest in fitness with alternatives to spend time and CAKE just doesn't play out intermediate or long term. You've got to be kidding me."
Amazing value for this stock it’s going to beat earnings 28$ price target
Just bought some yesterday. We stopped and ate at the Old Orchard location and business was pretty good. Not great but pretty good.
"Imagine the stock price of CAKE in 5 to 10 years when there are 200 more Blanco’s, 200 more North Italia’s, and 200 more Flower Child Restaurants. Then imagine 100 more Cheesecake Factories. Then imagine an incredible number of Social Monk restaurants added into the picture. Ten years from now imagine the wealth that such growth could deliver. CAKE could have a 10 year return like Monster Beverage Company or Chipotle. Right now we all have to decide do we want to be part of it or do we want to step away, and pass this one up. But ask yourself how many times in the past have you been haunted by passing up such opportunities? I got out of Adobe in the late 90’s after a good run up. At the time, the shorts were saying that Microsoft would take over their spot. I made good money then. But the stock is nearly $500 now. Split adjusted back then it was about a dollar. Ask yourself, when it comes to CAKE, do you want to buy the growth or do you want to go short with the guy who is rooting for COVID to make a come back?"
"So if you took the time to listen to the earnings call, and you understand what was said (a HUGE issue), it could not of been more upbeat.Would you prefer a bigger quarterly beat, or a healthy forecast and balance sheet during such challenging times?"
"A bakers dozen of reasons why everyone should own CAKE stock:1.)Cheesecake Factory is extremely popular. Prior to Covid they had recorded positive sales growth in 21 out of 24 quarters. 2.)They have reduced competition due to COVID. Approximately 100,000 restaurants have permanently closed due to COVID.3.)CAKE is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of this opportunity due to the large diversity of restaurants that they now have under their corporate umbrella since the Fox Restaurant Concepts acquisition.4.)The Fox acquisition itself. With the Fox acquisition, CAKE bought North Italia, Flower Child, Blancos, Culinary Dropout, and all of the other Fox Restaurants. These restaurants are very popular everywhere they are launched, and currently there are only a few of them. Look for the total number of Fox Restaurants to explode over the coming years. For Blanco’s, North Italia, and Flower Child an increase of approximately 10x has been mentioned.5.)CAKE has devised a unique and innovative strategy for determining which Fox restaurants are to be taken to the national stage. Sam Fox comes up with the restaurant concepts from the FRC office in Phoenix. Then he launches test locations in Arizona and in other places. Then CAKE launches the best performing ones nationally.6.)Sam Fox. He is the genius behind the Fox Restaurant Concepts company. Widely regarded as one of the savviest restaurant entrepreneurs in the country, Sam Fox is now one of CAKE greatest assets. He now uses his genius with the backing of one of the most innovative companies restaurant companies in the world. 7.)CAKE, with the FRC restaurants, is entering into new markets. Some of the FRC restaurants fall into the fast, casual market, and this area is projected to grow substantially in the coming years. CAKE also has Social Monk which is a new Asian fast food restaurant. They could open an incredible number of Social Monks in the coming years.8.)Many of the new FRC are less expensive to open. It takes 8 to 9 million dollars to open a Cheesecake Factory, but some of the FRC names can be opened for 2 to 3 million. Yet they are quite profitable.9.)The FRC restaurants seem to be quite popular with younger demographics. These restaurants are more edgy, and a good addition to a company that appeals to wide variety of demographics that range from mom and dads to actors and rappers.10.)The national nightmare of Covid is almost behind us. The population is being vaccinated, and restrictions are being lifted. And now CAKE is coming out in a strong position. They have a good amount of cash, and a large line of credit for expansion. 11.)CAKE seems to be carrying over off site sales, on line sales, pick up, and deliveries, even in restaurants that now have no seating restrictions. In fact, they seem to be retaining 90% of these sales, so it is likely to expect such sales to be a major engine of growth in the coming years.12.)CAKE has the potential to be earn an incredible amount of profit as things finally turn. Prior to Covid they had experienced earnings growth in 21 of the previous 24 quarter. Prior to Covid they were earning respectable profits and paying a dividend. Now we are coming out of COVID, and CAKE has more restaurants, and the Fox acquisition is accelerating growth. When you consider all of these factors, with the fact that CAKE is no longer paying out $1.38 per share in dividend the way they did in 2019, it seems reasonable to expect this company to report outstanding net profits in the coming quarters.13.)And the last reason that I am posting is that America loves a winner, and as Covid wanes, nostalgia for the way things were before the nightmare will grow. Cheesecake Factory has been popular every since they open their first restaurant. Many peoples best memories, from the days before the masks and all of the draconian rules, took place in restaurants where meals were enjoyed with friends and families. As Americans discard their masks and emerge from the nightmare of Covid, there will be a desire to frequent the places that survived the carnage. Such places link people to the past before all of the madness, death, and despair of Covid. People will desire to create great new memories that shine as bright as those of yesteryears. It’s likely that many such memories took place in a Cheesecake Factory, and that many more memories will be made there in the future."
"star date 4/33/33Kirk hails the Romulans and at last communicates directly with his opponent, offering to help him sell his CAKE shares. The Romulan commander tells Kirk that he regrets having met him in CAKE message board, that ""You and I are of a kind. In a different reality, I could have called you friend."" He declines Kirk's offer to SELL his shares, telling the Captain that it is not the Romulan way to sell (they buy and hold). The Commander then triggers his ship's self-destruct system.Kirk out"
142 million because they pulled out another 90 million from their revolving line of credit. Also note that the long term debt is overstated if you don't dig into the 10K. On most services the LTD is listed as 1.6 billion. But if you strip away future lease obligations (which are also carried as an asset on the asset side of the balance sheet ) their LTD is only 290 million. So they currently stand with 142 million in cash and 290 million in non current long term debt. My fear is that 50% same store sale plunge will look more like a 75% same store sale plunge in April. So lets extrapolate a bit on a per month basis. For the month of April and every month they are closed after that it looks doing some very rough back of the napkin calculations and making a lot of assumptions that they will lose about 58 million per month. Of course not all of that is in cash most likely since the cash flow is usually greater than net income. But they could easily lose 40 million per month.So they might be able to sustain themselves for another 3 months on current cash operating at about 25% capacity. I'm assuming carryout will be about 25% of previous revenue. But making wild assumptions here.And I suspect they are working on getting an additional loan. One problem they also have but not taken into account for is that I'd bet their loan has a maximum leverage ratio tied to it. So their leverage goes up as cash burns... Hopefully the creditors will work with them.Also I haven't taken into account that they aren't paying their rents.
"The earnings report and outlook sounded great. The restaurants continue to execute quite well. I think the new Covid strains are a factor in the stocks decline because other restaurants and mall owners (SPG) are being hit. However to those who have vaccinated, these new strains are a non issue. To be quite honest, I think that the company is being too conservative with their expansion plans. I think they should aim for opening 25 new restaurants per year, Fourteen née locations per year is too low. I also think that they should consider focusing on Blancos as much as North Italia and Flower Child. I will continue to hold this stock for at least nine more years because I think that Cheesecake Factory and the new Fox acquisition restaurants can deliver consistent growth for at least the next 10 years."
"Something to consider for the future. As Covid disappears and restaurant dining rooms reopen without restrictions, some restaurants will be more successful than other at retaining off-site sales. These sales are pick up, internet based, and delivery. Early data shows that fully reopened Cheesecake Factories with no restrictions on seating capacity are still retaining 90% of off site sales. Why are they being so successful in this endeavor?, one might ask. Well consider this scenario that is undoubtedly unfolding all over the country. Pretend you work for an office with 20 employees, and you all want to order lunch to be picked up by Door-dash. Your coworkers are a group of people with diverse taste, yet you all would like to eat together at the same time. Cheesecake Factory with its massive menu is the perfect choice in such a scenario. Their menu has seafood, steaks, Italian, Mexican, and Asian cuisine, and well as traditional American food, such as burgers and sandwiches. They also have Cajun foods and Caribbean Jerk seasoned food. Then for dessert you can choose between dozens of cheesecaked and other offerings. Their menu is so large that there is always something new to try. This is why CAKE will keep their off site sales even as their restaurants fully reopen with no capacity limits. They are a choice for lunch that everyone can agree upon. Now imagine CAKE’s potential sales after reopening to full capacity coupled with the 90% retained off site sales? Also add in the new restaurants and diminished competition. CAKE is a screaming buy!"
"How can you guys not see the writing on the wall. Nordstrom sales down 53%. That is a high-end retailer. CAKE is a high-end chain restaurant that is in many of the same malls as Nordstrom. When weather turns sour in a couple months, what is gonna be the exuse then. Cake is in trouble! Big time. I wish I could buy more long-dated puts, but they are not available...another sign that there is a ton of negative sentiment out there. They do not have multiple years worth of cash as some of you have speculated."
"Cake was doing good. Revenue increasing, increasing profit margin but they got hit pretty hard w the virus.58 million cash in hand only and theyve probably already ate through it all in the last couple of weeks since they have to pay salaries.1.3 billion debt, over 50% of which was shareholder equity. So about 600 million of that is gone. They still owe about 12 or 13 times more than what they have (or had) in cash.Additionally they have a dividend payment coming they most likely can't afford.Will go down to under 8 dollars in my opinion and the company is in danger unless it is rescued."
"well, all we need is one deep pocket guy to come in and short sqeeze thoes 40% shorts to 32$"

"I went to $Cake in Sherman Oaks Galleria, in Los Angeles.Circa 10,000 SF restaurant. Place was packed. I counted circa 200 customers and many were waiting to be seated. Question is what's their profit margins They have, between 30 to 40 staff. Rent is not cheap. Nonetheless, they are printing money lol..I have seen elderly lady and her family, had huge plates of nothing but spaghetti. It costh Cheese Cake, approx .$0.50 .They probably charged $18 per plate. Visually Cake is Rocking. On September 14th Hopefully, current Governor will be recalled. New Governor, hopefully will get rid off mandatory masks & will open up economy. I congecture, $Cake is a great entry point now. It will be $75 -$80 in a year or less."
Where do you see this stock come Christmas time
First post here....went out for first night out and ran across a CAKE employee tonight finishing his shift here in FL. They are slammed with businesses. Unfortunately these big box restaurants are crushing the mom and pops across the country. All of the dead weight employees are loving the extra stimulus unemployment checks and they are running lean while rehiring Asia fast as they can folks who want to work rather than sick the tit of tax payers...expect a rebound of this stock!
Is the pandemic over? No. Is the stock back near to its pre-pandemic price? No. Has CAKE figured out how to do business in this new era while the pandemic is still around. Yes. I am therefore a patient long looking at the stock to retrace its high in 2021 once management gives the go ahead to revive dividends when they see clarity in the next year. IMHO. God Bless and stay well.
fizzy get dizzy...
No frosting on this CAKE
Expansion plans will be out soon !
"The fear of the pandemic is hurting the whole restaurant sector. CAKE is the unfortunate beneficiary of that sentiment, particularly since most of it's operations are in California --a current hot spot of the Delta virus."
this stock will be over its pre pandemic price before the pandemics over
Does any one have some numbers?
"Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.91 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.23 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 54.24%.now that is an impressive Q ... CAKE should have done betterthan they did"
I heard about CAKE the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Almost 10% gain in an hour
"CAKE is now rated as a Strong Buy on Zacks, and they have increased their earning estimates for the company by 81.6% in the last 60 days. JT_kirk20 it’s time to join your beloved Zacks and praise the inevitable rise of CAKE. But as penitence for your silliness you must make you a cheesehead hat like the fans wear at the Green Bay football games, except your hat needs to be modified in a most appropriate way. Instead of wearing a giant wedge of cheese, your hat should be a giant piece of cheesecake. Then you must wear it for an entire day, but you also need to wear a t-shirt that reads, “I shorted CAKE, and they stripped me of my Starfleet command. Then they made me wear this hat."
Bought cake @ 60.22.....looks good...
The restaurant business traditionally have very thin margin so how can one make money if you only have 60% seats available. Think about that for a moment.
Inflation and DEBT just like I said earlier
"It clearly does seem to have some resistance right at $60, but eventually it should roar right through. When investors discover the truth about this company, the stock will soar to incredible levels. Most people still think of this company as only the Cheesecake Factory restaurant, and by doing that, they miss the true story here. Yes, the Cheesecake Factory is a great restaurant with a bright future, but CAKE is more than Cheesecake Factory. Don’t forget about the restaurants that came with the Fox Acquisition. They are the key to putting it all together. The stock is compelling on many fronts. It is a value play because the share price does not yet reflect how well they are going to do when all the states lift their dinning room seating limits, and they face a landscape where many of their competitors will have decided to remain closed. Unfortunately, many great mom and pop restaurants and bars will not be coming back so you will have an increase in potential customers as their patrons have to go elsewhere. The growth story that will create major shareholder wealth will come as the result of major expansion of both Cheesecake Factory Restaurants and all of the Fox businesses. The best way to describe CAKE today is to say that it is like Darden Restaurants was 20 years ago, except it has better restaurant offerings and the competitive landscape is much more favorable today. Hold this stock for 10 years, and you will be amazed! It’s a 10 bagger from here. Maybe someday when you look back and you have all this money from CAKE stock, you’ll recall this post. This is a stock that you want to hold long term."
"This Social Monk restaurant that CAKE is experimenting with seems intriguing to me. Could this be a fast food Asian Restaurant that might be a potential competitor to Panda Express? Panda Express has 1600 locations is the US, and the food is ok, but not great. And if you arrive within an hour or two of closing, they will be out of whatever item you want to buy. What if CAKE launches this new restaurant nationwide with Cheesecake Factory quality. I bet they could pull off thousands of these. Now think of North Italia and Flower Child restaurants and all of those they will open in the coming years. They opened two Flower Child locations during Covid. This is why I’m long. Could be a 10 bagger in 6-10 years."
Cake does $210-$250 million a year in EBITDA and entore company is selling at 3x that....stock will come back strong
Cheesecake is taking down the entire restaurant sector. Or could there be something else afoot ?
The DELTA will take this stock down....further
Was looking for a restaurant recovery play for my portfolio and picked up 200 shares at 20.50. What clinched it was my brother lives in the City and said he and his wife was going to Cheesecake to eat the other day and the line was so long they decided to go elsewhere. I live in a rural area and have never eaten at a cheesecake but after he told that I have to believe in a lot of demand. It just might take a while torebound. What was the dividend before they cut it anyone?
"If you’re buying CAKE right now, I got a bridge to sell you. Negative EPS, lots of debt, and so many other companies that will give you a better return right now. Why buy cake right now when you can buy it at the same or lower price in a few months?"
CAKE is up 5.79% to 49.68
Today the cake rises at least in the Pre- market it 8%
looks like .75 is the est for earnings ?
An absolute mess.....
"Inflation data is a temporary blip, and nothing major. Wise investors learn to take advantage of such over reactions in the market. Nothing has fundamentally changed. At all the CAKE restaurants the lines are still long, and more places are getting back to normal. Earnings for the next few quarters should be incredible. The only factor that has changed is now you can buy shares a little cheaper due to the over all market pull back. Go long. Buy and hold. This stock is the place where you want to be right now."
I bought the dip at 20.50 but I really wanted to buy below 20. But looks like it won't go down past that

"The Cheesecake Factory Could Correct before making new highs is an interesting article. It appears in the news section for CAKE. The author points out that based on technical analysis CAKE might correct back to a probable low of 56 or maybe little lower before hitting a new high of around $100.00 per share. I personally have not found technical analysis to be useful when determining when to buy or sell a stock. The problem with TA is that it operates under the assumption that all of the factors that produced a stock’s signature graph pattern will remain the same in the future as they have been in the past. Yet, that is never the case. There are always unique extraneous factors, some of which, could never be predicted that will affect a stocks price. This is why we don’t see a plethora of high performing mutual funds that use TA for their decision making. If TA worked well, we would see such funds, and they would out perform the market indices. The fact that such high performing funds don’t exist should make us view TA with some skepticism. Yet, the article was good. However, I believe the next high listed for CAKE is too low. The Last Man Standing phenomena described in the article is real, and much more powerful in this economy than most people realize. I will tip my hat to James Kramer and those who wrote this article because very few analysts are noting the Last Man Standing, and those who understand its ramifications stand to make an enormous amount of money. And CAKE, without a doubt, is in the best position to prosper from it. So, I will hold CAKE even as it blows by the $100.00 per share price mentioned in this article because that will just be the beginning. Chipotle is trading at $1500.00 per share, once it also was at $60.00 per share. CAKE with its Fox Restaurant properties is going to thrive in this new environment."
"Some helpful advice for “The World”. I want everyone to make a lot of money, and if consider what I’m saying, and then buy this stock and hold it for a while you will be able to cash it in for whatever Tesla you want. The easiest way for you to gain insight into why this stock is going up and why it is surpassing pre-pandemic levels would be for you to look up the restaurants that came with the Fox Restaurant Concept acquisition. Then look at these restaurants and compared them to the ones that Darden Restaurants offers. Then ask yourself which company has room to grow. Darden’s best offering is Olive Garden. It’s ok, but not as good as North Italia, and there is already an Olive Garden in every city in the US that can support one. CAKE will be opening new Cheesecake Factories all over the place. They just opened a new one in Clearwater Florida that is doing huge business right out of the gate. Currently there are around 25 North Italia restaurants, and there are around 25 Flower Child Restaurants that came in the Fox Restaurant Concept acquisition. Ultimately CAKE plans to have 200 of each of these nationwide. Then consider all of the other Fox Restaurants Concepts names that Cheesecake Factory will be launching. Then look up the market cap of Darden Restaurants. You will find it is nearly 10 times as high as Cheesecake Factory. If this doesn’t persuade you that the 93% institutional ownership of this company and it meteoric stock price rise are not due to incredible growth prospects, then research the Social Monk Asian fast food venue they are testing in California. They could open a thousand of them! If you think CAKE is over valued, check out Shake Shack. Do get me wrong, I love Shake Shack, but CAKE looks cheap compared to it. If you think CAKE has run up too much, look at Dave and Busters. It’s gone from 4 to 40. And then check out Chipotle. It’s $1500 a share! CAKE’s share price has a lot of room to grow. When CAKE acquired Fox Restaurant Concepts, it was like a really good NBA team signing a young Michael Jordan. Now investors are figuring it all out. From here, this stock is a 10 bagger. I loaded up at 20, and could cash in for a great profit, but I do not plan to sale for a decade because I know the next 10 years for this stock looks really good. For a while the shorts ravaged this stock, and I tried to make them see the light. But a few didn’t listen. If you pass them on the street corner, put a dollar in their cup, and say old Profit-meister says hi."
"Just ate at Blancos in Nashville. At 3:00pm, it was full. The whole front of the restaurant is open air. I had Tiger shrimp fajitas and Mexican Chocolate Tiramisu. It was incredible. Blancos features Sonoran Mexico food. There aren’t many restaurants out there that feature this sub type of Mexican food. To the longs out there who have never tried Blancos, you would be amazed. The food is incredible, and they are always busy. They are known for their margaritas and chimichangas. The food that I have eaten there is some of the best Mexican that I have ever eaten, and let tell you it feels good knowing that right now there are only 10 Blanco’s in the whole country!!! This is the kind of restaurant that completely obliterates competition. Every day we have been to Blancos we have come in that slow period between lunch and dinner. Yet, the tables and the bar are always completely packed. Longs will be greatly rewarded as these restaurants are launched everywhere. Anyone who sells their shares now is guaranteed to feel like crazy by Christmas! As for me, I want to wait around until there will be 200 Blancos, 200 North Italias, 200 Flower Child Restaurants, and 200 more Cheesecake Factories. All of this will happen, and when it does, what will the share price be? The stock will be a 10 bagger from here."
What’s happening to make it rise so much
They had some interesting insights about CAKE on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"These numbers don’t look that great, what do we think?"
I was in the Franklin TN location Monday. Wall to wall for lunch!
UNTIL THEY DON'T HVE A VACCINE THE RESTAURANTS BUSINESS IS OVER
"Over 90,000 fewer restaurants and bars due to COVID. New restaurants and aggressive expansion plans. Blancos count going from 9 to 200. North Italia count going from 25 to 200. Flower Child count going from 25 to 200. Many new Cheesecake Factories opening, domestically and internationally. Expansion of Social Monk nationally. Social Monk is CAKE’s new fast food Asian restaurant. This is what is coming for CAKE. The future is bright. Go long. Enjoy the coming growth that will mean soaring stock prices and much more wealth to shareholders. Don’t let the panicking shorts steer you away from the new Darden."
