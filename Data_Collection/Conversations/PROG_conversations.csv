"What is happening here is actually very illegal, considering there are thousands of shares still being shorted with ZERO availability. I’m with everyone here on reporting this."

For every penny this goes up is just another nail in the Shorts coffin. Start nailing now.
MM trying to push down the price in final 30 min. I have done my part. Bought 5000 shares a moment ago
I’m in big @ $2.40 let’s go to $4 WHY NOT
HOLD . this stock has HUGE POTENTIAL
I am sure if is getting accumulated and played by volume traders. They are flipping heavily and we are seeing volatility due to that. If they keepHolding and squeeze it it will squeeze 100%Hold
I just reported to my state congressman and senate sites to investigate naked shorting. Tell them you believe exchanges are illegally giving out shares that aren't covered because you watch the order floats.
"We NEED this to close high today. Help us, help yourself. Buy and hold."
Cmon everyone buy what you can! We all know this is a $5 minimum stock!
$2.50 here we come....
here we go ;)
"Every naked short, and every minute this stock stays above 2$, the brighter our future is gentleman."
sooner or later short squeeze will start
i am holding for you
HC Wainwright & Co. initiated a BUY rating with $4 PT. GL guys!
"and then I told them, gamma short squeeze thingy was coming at the end of the day"
Now! We need to buy buy buy just BUY!
hold . do not sell . option closing friday. they have to cover
5am just got to work. Coffee in hand and strapped in. Waiting for blast off...
Does anyone even know what this company does?
Zing!!!! This company gets multiple approvals in a day!!! Unheard of! What I wouldn’t do to be the CEO this week! Nailed it!!!! Great job folks!
Nobody is selling this stock! pure manipulation of order flow delay.
insiders are buying heavily
.40 away from the moon
Classic buy the hype/sell the news
To the moon...again!
"Today HC Wainwright & Co.Initiates Coverage On Prog withBuy rating, PT 4.0"
Here she goes! See ya at the top kids!
When is this supposed short squeeze coming.? Asking for a friend.
My second truck is up for loading. buy buy buy lol
Hold dont sell
"Power of buy is coming ,just watch."
get the news out to WSB. let's bring this to 100+
not selling. buying more
"Buy if it dips below $2, and buy HARD the last two hours. Then HOLD til next week."
2021-10-14 10:31:00 GMT DJ Progenity Price Target Announced at $4.00/Share by HC Wainwright & Co.we flying?
When the shorts get scared and cover their position that’s just the first push. The second push coming will have this over $4
"If you look at the 3 months chart, you will see that this stock is way undervalued…. Heading back to $3+ soon. By the way, they just got upgraded with $4 target"
Here's the report page for the SEC. I encourage everyone to file a complaint. If they get enough there will be an investigation. https://www.sec.gov/tcr
"Kids, you need to stop buying $5 calls, they’re never gonna turn ITM in just two days. And I don’t think you’ll want to exercise them either.Just buy the shares or calls already ITM and ready to exercise them."
Fun stuff! Pushing $3 by close on Friday!
"The SI reported on Ortex has increased rapidly again, so they naked shorted yesterday and today and then try to find lenders later. Typical."
the objective here is to squeeze right?
LOL this is incredible. I'm watching my level 2 and 14k shares are just being continuously loaded in over and over again.
Anyone estimates this will last until?
"4.2 pre market volume, probably hit close 8mil before open. more and more people have this on their watchlist"
Yes 
"What's the progability this will ever see a true short squeeze? Get it, PROGability ?"
if this stays above $2 at the close of market tom. there will be a lot of call options exercised at $2 flooding the volume with buys
I’m calling in “RICH” tomorrow from work….early retirement after I sell 20 percent and keep the other 80 for the long haul!
I flooded the volume with a little over 9000 shares half hour ago when it dipped to 2.10. I don't care if I'm down ill ne down I know what we need to do is buy and hold until market close tom
The chart is showing bot trading now. Later will skyrocket towards EOD. No one is selling.
"Guys, please don't sell after you buy. Now MM are only playing with us because still early. The real battle will only start in the last 2 hours. So now you buy and hold will be good. Before EOD, they need to cover and that is when short squeeze will really start. Make sense? Teamwork is required. Don't get affected by the trend or shorts because they only trying to make you sell early."
$3 pls
Bought another 10k shares. Lets go!
"after hours volume looked a little slow with 500k now a million trending more on the buying side. everyone is prepared for tom, buy buy buy, no dumping don't be greedy, wait until Monday than do whatever u like lol"
Now they're just holding it between 2.06 and 2.07 with dark pool exchanges.
"Accumulator- if there were to be a buyout it would be above $7.00. There is a different premium put on pharma and biotech companies than that of standard companies. R&D costs alone have a higher premium. Then you also have what they call “Patent Trolls” to come sniffing around this business and what premium they may put on these patents. So while I venture to guess I think $7.00 is the floor with $11.00 being the ceiling as today stands. But, if there is a major short squeeze then all bets are off."
Yesterday we closed at $2.14 and they want you to believe after all that buying today that it only went up a few cents. lol Buying the dip!
"It lives,,....."
"Even if they push this down to just below $2 tomorrow, there's still quite a few call options in the $1 and $1.50 range that they'll need to cover for. I highly doubt they can push this down that far. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. I hope the shorts burn."
"This is being suppressed by dark pool trading and naked shorting. In the past two days we've had huge volume, and about 80 percent of the float has changed hands and yet the price is barely moving."
Zero shares to short since yesterday
0 shares left to short on Interactive brokers.
Battle ti’ll $2.51
Team work makes dream work.
"Nice squeeze, if we can push this to 2.50, the shorts are finished"
It's going up as the price is keeps going down.Short Interest Change+12.71%
"Wake up, train is leaving the station!"
"This thing is fixing to explode soon!! Either it starts today or Monday, but the VOLUME speaks volume on this! Easy double"
"If this is over 2 by 3:59, I'm totally sinking another 1000 into it."
don't be surprised if a lot of hedge funds will be dumping money in to this stock today to cover those $5dollar calls. maybe they were not expecting it to rise in premarket before Oct 15. reddit is a powerful weapon against the machine these days
most undervalued stock in the market
Yahoo investors.
cheap shares at this level keep buying double down...buy buy buy lol
Why are people selling?
strong supp at 2.1
Gaps filled. Lets go!
Ah some life in the premarket.
"I will get on here and say whatever i like. I bought this and once again have lost money. I'm not a shill, I'm not being paid and am free to say whatever i like as long as I don't hurt anybody. If you dont like it, keep your comments to yourself. I'm not here to debate anyone"
who bought at 2.48?
2.50 and a gamma squeeze is coming tomorrow/monday
"If you hold your shares, they have to look for shares at higher sell prices. Hold your shares and put a sell order on them for 5$ minimum for today. Not saying it will hit 5, but your shares wont be bought cheap."
bought 3500 more
"As long as everyone but and HOLD, fully paid for the shares, we will see the squeeze happening today. Be patience. We need to be disciplined and stick to our strategy to win this battle.every 10% drop or so, Buy some and keep holding. The shorts will run out of shares eventually."
charting the same pattern as yesterday at this time... preparing to buy more
Another 100 shares ..bought . Will keep buying to 10k. I will do my part to make it painful for shorts to hold over the weekend
Bruhs this isnt just a pump and dump squeeze just enjoy the ride the coming months could b epic
Why sell?
"Volume will come. Since we have bought and holding, there is not much shares for shorts to buy. And they are afraid of dropping it too low because we will buy more and continue holding if they did that. So they just try to trade their own shares. This will surge up in the afternoon because they do not have much time left. They need to buy back shares for option expiration tomorrow. Get it? Lol. Stay clear minded and even if you do nothing, as much as you hold, they will have to do something and buyback today."
"Pump Up The VOLUME! Tweet, Post, Like, Share, and Pump all you can!"
"I'm not telling you to hold this forever, all I'm saying is tell everyone you know to put money into this tom, make it close at 2.50 AT close of market and options will be exercised. this will make this explode"
"Guys, you need to fully pay for your shares, otherwise the shorts can still borrow your shares even though you set high selling price. Stop using margin if you are using now."
shorts gota cover in 30min
thanks to reddit we have this stock trending in the Asian and euro market
"just bought another 10,000.Can't do it alone!LFG!"
Added 5k more shares today just now at 2.14
"I couldn't be happier that I found https://stockhaul.today/LiveTradingRoom . In the market, every trader needs an edge. Trade Ideas is my edge because it is fast, accurate and flexible. It helps me increase my profitability by quickly finding stocks that are moving and lists them in a way that allows me to decide which one I want to trade."
I would suggest shorts to pack up lol
Blessings rejoice. Trust in JESUS. John 3:16. 
Lets get to 2.50 ;)
we can win!
Clear for takeoff!!
"Shorts are trapped, only 40k shares showing available to short on Fintel, SI% over 53% now on Ortex, and the price is escalating due to gamma squeeze. Soon thereafter: short squeeze. L. F. G !!!"
We're holding fast...let's keep it above $2.
Price action makes no sense. $4 target and 4 patents
"Look at the 1 month chart, from 2.10 to 1.73 and then to 2.70, this is beginning of something big!"
hold
Hey shorts…
Just hold! You will be rewarded$$$
buy today and hold
I have a buy order set for $2.01...hoping that is at 3:59.55 EST
"just bought 2500 shares and I'm down already, someone tell me I didn't fall into another trap."
How has this gone down nearly 40 cents in the last hour and a half? I'm waiting for some explanations?
We all know the patents worth $$billions$$ Dollar.Confidence with what you have.
"they delayed the press release for the patents, ceo said webelieve we hold one of the most robust ingestible device patents right before they have a partnership conference on Oct 28, wink wink buy out in Oct lol, how does anyone not see this with all the call volume strike price at $5. because they know a buy out is coming"
"Lol, what was that? +7% to -4% back and forwards.Someone really don't care if their losing money, they really want to keep the price below $3"
Wow... this thing is really moving!!!
"I’m still holding at 18,900 shares since 1.59I ain’t selling"
Fun to watch! Zoom zoom
"Fintel had 400,000 shares 15 minutes ago, now it shows 100,000, they're shorting it down again."
"I have $6500 ready to buy more I’llDo my part,, are you going to?? Together we United"
Hold or buy — insiders suppressing price for $5-$7 buyout end of month
"This is what we meant about how we said Sellers are going to be in control today, HOLD"
"If no squeeze, then wait for buyout. Departed CEO keep his big amount of shares. No sell. So means buyout is coming."
only 39 cents separates us between breaking out like AMC GME if this closes at 2.50 AT 4pm today. tell everyone literally everyone
"Ppl holding and adding got nothing to worry about , life is sweet. Ppl shouting and angry are dsytraders and option players. The latter have no time and get emotional. The smart ones really don't care cause they know payday will eventually come...chill ppl and have a great weekend...."
So no Gamma squeeze ?
Wow.. this squeeze is amazing!!
just bought 1400 shares.
"Set my sell price to $100, not selling"
its an excellent lauch pad at this level.. keep buying until such time DO NOT SELL...BUY BUY BUY LOL
"looks more like a trap now, lets fall in buy buy buy lol"
We have ignition
Set sell orders in at 9.50 or higher
LETS GOOOO
They did whatever possible to hold the price down. But it never goes down anymore. I'm just laughing and celebrating the unavoidable rise of Progenity. Next week their job will be the same but this time at $3. End of year worst scenario is $5 and retails are all aware of this.
I just joined in I promise I will hold it til we squeeze this. 
"Some of the 2 dollar calls are exercising. Not sure it can push past the 2.25 mark though, even if they all went in. The 2 dollar puts keeping MM in this range. The game is on, but will go into the coming weeks in guessing. it's all guessing here. but holding regardless."
I just unmuted all the paid bashers and it’s so silent
Company is worth 650 million. Equals at least north of $5! Park it!
1.59 billion shares traded this month... and counting
"10,000,000 volume in 15 min ! Like XELA in his peak time ! Let go and good luck !"
Holding until at least EOY

"There is a PR expected tomorrow, am I correct?"
When is this squeeze coming. HTB list. Very few to zero shares available to short. 44.5% APR if you can borrow. When? Not if.
bought another 2k shares.. going to the moon and beyond
Its the time now!!!!
Told you
17000 shares and holding strong!!!!
That was weird!
Just bought 10k more shares
$PALI and $PROG are in never surrender mode. Squeeze those grapes

"Shortees really attacking for days now, shorts should be more than 50% of the float, when get the short squeeze, uuuuuuuuu bay bay, meng oh meng."
Loaded up another 7771 shares
Short have no way out now. Reddit army coming. Lol
Bought another 5000 shares. Lol
! I just have a feeling this is the ticker to be in for next week. It has gained more and more attention in the past days! Don't think it would take much more pressure to break upwards hard. We reach $5 and we start trending. That is where the fun starts.
HOLD ! its that easy !
"Keep buying, added more myself"
Trying hard to make sure those 2$ calls tomorrow don’t cover
Time Since Last Change: 58mTimestamp (UTC): 2021-10-15 13:57:47.289US:PROG Short Shares Availability: 0 <-------

https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative here is link to report illegal naked shorting of PROG stock to congressman. Report to all of them usually a state has 2 I believe. Senate is most important
Correct me if I'm wrong but is that 158m volume for pre market?
make it 2.5+ then squeeze will come on monday!
"If we can keep this above $2, preferably above $2.5, tomorrow then shorts are going to have to buy a lot to cover."
can this be the next GME 
Cost to borrow minimum just shot up from 0.51% to over 30%! LFG!
"Starting to go up again. They have to start buying. Don't sell, just sit back and enjoy the show"
not good day...
Lets push it up altogether...buy buy buy lol I m loading my other truck now.
Expect good news coming soon
2 n half hours till rocket time
Go baby go
Loaded my truck to top double or nothing buy buy buy lol
All that shorted to bring it down...has to be bought back.
For everyone holding and taking back shares throughout the day. We are teammates and i love you.
This thing about to be a battlefield today
More and more analysts upgrading the price
"wrestling back and forth a penny with 1.5 mill premarket volume, today is going to be a battle between the bulls and shorts. expect huge volume whatever the outcome"
"almost 700k volume after stock dives and now it's up 5 cents right away, wake up smell the coffee"
Cover time
that after hours volume is them buying your shares back
I HAVE A DREAM!
"Isn't one of their patents for the oral deliver of macromolecules such as vaccines, that up until now we're only effective through shots? Just think of future possibilities. Great new technology here!"
! Just imagine the possibilities when not if this gaps up! The best part is no one knows how high it could go! GLTA
Debating on selling my other positions at a small loss and putting it all in
4.4M pre-market volume... in the top 50 movers this morning
Bought at .70 / .80 / 1.83 / 1.63 / 2.28 and today at 2.09 ... holding on
"Train will be on time today, get your seat buy and hold lol"
"$PROGENITY, INC. Observation lately- Shorties are supposed to play an important role in balancing price action in the market. We win some, they lose some but overall everyone makes money and theres market equilibrium. It seems to me ive been noticing that shorties take a odd delight in not only people losing money but obliterating a stock completely.Am I wrong? The part I’m having trouble with is that some of these companies they’re so intent on destroying actually help people and do a lot of good."
buying today
Short interest increased 11.91% Ctb avg 91.36%Days to cover .98
"they don't want this stock to breakout and they don't want it to go to low. atyhriun wants it exactly at this pps, to keep on picking up shares on the dip before a buyout this or next month"
IF 2.5 or 3 + when shorts has to recover? today or Monday?
Options for tomorrow. Don’t sell. Exercise your right. This will moon the stock. At least to 3$
$FAMI is the next runner. This one is done.
"Add on these dips and you don’t need much when the lid blows here, 15k in stock will be 100k!"
2.50 call options for tomorrow??
"No volume, just wait, consolidation before the burst"
They are trying to accumulate shares from weak hands. You will regret if you sell now. The surge up later will be fast and furious as EOD approaching. They need to buy back as many shared as possible.
i am buying in morning. buy whatever you can. tomorrow is the day.
Have patience. Don't get distracted if you want to win big here. Shorts looking at every opportunity to make you sell cheap
Just buy more if you can extra money and hold. Use up all their shares.
"Be patient everyone, the squeeze will happen"
still need to close that gap at $2.04. then it can move up again
"Even if we only closed at $2 on Friday, 50,000+ call contracts will still be ITM, 5 million shares will have to be delivered.How many of those were naked calls? I say it’s most of them since the utilization is almost 100%, the only legal way to short this stock will be writing a naked call (oddly, unlike naked shorting, it’s still not illegal)"
Looks like we’re gonna have to hold for a while
There will be an ss after 10:30 all star lined up buy buy buy lol
I am holding tight and not giving up to these day traders manipulations. This should reach 4$ at least soon
Holding until November 20th. No matter what. Bullish AF.

Be careful. Don't rush in to buy. May be a trap. Hold first. Don't sell. Don't do anything.
"seriously almost 2 million after hours volume, who do you think is buying up shares, not retail investors"
Everyone needs to buy more today and do their part so can double the impact on shorts. This battle needs a group effort.
"Just bought my first 13,000 shares of prog at 2.23 Les gooo!"
Keep it above 2.10 until 2:30 then the shorts will start worrying.
"If i were you reading this right now, id buy."
Not much cash. But I add a little everytime it drops under 2.09
Look at that chart. Moon time before close
Got upgraded to $4+ Easy double from here guys. Just buy and hold
I am buying every dip
"it's funny they have a partnership conference, that's key word for alright we know you are all interested in buying our company whose giving me the highest price per share."
what happens now?
"Grab your seat and watch, cover charge applies. DO NOT SELL buy buy buy lol"
Do we have Reddit bye our side today to push any work/use know somebuddy at reddit to reminde the people 
My God the manipulation. Right back to where we were.
"I'm sorry but the shorties gotta be really panicked at the strength PROG has showed at the $2 mark. The reason this will never crash hard like say CEI is simple. This stock is 80% institutional owned and is not dependent on the retail investor, which many times can be very paper handed and ruin momentum. Nope not enough room here for shorts or paper handed kids to hurt this stock and that's why I love it."
For anyone saying there's no manipulation. Explain to me why the entire float has been traded two times over and volume is through the roof. No price movement. The market is rigged.
Shorts talking to each other: “So what you’re saying is….
Whoooooo’s ready for
Short sale restriction
"Predicting gap up in after hours, race to over $2.50 to put a ton of options in the money this Friday is still on"
"Hahaha, the robots are trading amongst themselves at the moment, as soon as they stop it surges up, so they jump back in. They are trying to hold it here, but they cant do it forever, once they stop for too long, it will rocket up. This is headed well beyond $3 in the next little bit and then $4-$5 and then beyond."
"thinking athyrium does not want a buy out is like thinking trump does not want to run again. this is what athyrium does invests in biotech, acquires biotech and flips them for profit. up until recently the ceo of prog did not work for athyrium, now they have their own interim ceo. key word interim means not staying long. kind of like when administration's change and you have a lot of interim cabinet people until the new administration picks their own. buy out, what more proof do you need. look at the call options a 5 dollar strike price with barely any puts, hello am I the only one that sees how obvious this ia"
"when they say buy u sell, when they say sell you buy. that last press release wants you to sell"
Buy and hold
"Shorts, please leave when we are asking politely. We gave you enough time. Today will be last chance for you to recover!"
Really good chance at a squeeze today if we just buy and hold. We all can walk away with some money. Don't sell out.
"Insiders are buying, means something coming up . There still time to load before it takes off to the Moon "
lets hold buy
On the moon
Cover charge as is...buy buy buy lol
does anybody know why prog isnt being discussed at wallstreetbets so much?
"like clockwork, PROG drops during the day. If you want to add to your PROG position, wait till later in the day when it drops, then add. Don't add in the 1st hour...."
buy and hold!
Fintel ranked #1 for short squeeze.
Why is this dropping?
ok. Next step is to wait. the increase in price is inminent. waiting for confirmation...
Run Forest Run
Dark Pool Short Volume Ratio 54.65% - source: FINRAHOLD. they're cheating to keep it down.
almost 800k after market volume after stock takes a nose dive and up 4-5 cents right away. they bought back your shares again
PROG done for now???
"Spread the word about this stock, gamma squeeze is 100% happening if this stock is above $2.50 on Friday by putting tons of options in the money!"
Hold until the lid blows off this. You don’t need much to make a fortune. I turned 15k into 200k with SPRT. Hopping to make 100k of 10k here. 6 months and don’t care!
look at those beautiful green candles keep buying buy buy buy lol

Maybe we can hit $2.7 again today. Nothing is impossible. Lol buying more and hold
steady gains is what I love to see everyone talking about a squeeze man Just give me fda approval catalyst a buy out and this will b amazing
"We're gonna see another battle at $2.50 again today, mark my words"

"Looking at the 1 min interval chart, looked like MM and shorts are only waiting for people to sell to them. Trading among themselves right now. This is good. Later they will surge up, running out of ideas to make us sell. Lol"
The only selling I'm doing today will be at $3+ in post-market
LET'S GO BRANDON
