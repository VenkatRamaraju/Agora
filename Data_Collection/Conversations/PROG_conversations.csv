Just found this online. looks like I'm late to the party.. but I like the tech
If you have calls and are thinking of buying more shares exercise the calls instead...Or do both!
"Shorts can have my 35,000 shares for $69 per share only."
"Let’s just look at the facts. Even if PROG closes at current price, it is a 20% gain for the week. FACT. With the high interest rate on borrowed shares, I have no idea why anyone would hold short interest into next week, where I would anticipate another 20-50% increase?? Regardless, PROG’s pipeline looks beyond promising, and this stock has a bright future whether squeezed or not."
I told myself not to even look at this today. and I have not til just now... just added 1000 shares at 3.61 dip
Prog is following a trend I bin in since August check the 1 month. We went over 2 dropped cause the dilution but then soared to 2.48 we pulled back closed the week in the 2-2.10 range. Following week we broke 3 Monday and basically consolidated all weak with very minor pull back then we fought and closed under 3 for the week which brought us to this week where we hit 4.50( not counting ah or pre market) which will be our next leg up run right past the 5s. Good job prog family hang on
For the last month this has been correcting down to its previous peaks before legging up. I actually predicted this to level at between 3.35 and 3.40 before next week and I'm pleasantly surprised that it's holding here with such low volume. Still standing by my prediction that the next leg up will be 5-6.50 next week with or without conference news.
Sorry shorts but we are staying for the long haul
"The shorts will try to get this to close below $3.50 without holding their shares over the weekend. If people keep buying, it won't happen. It aint over"
new two big institutions bought Call options!Let's go!
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
Still holding 3.1k shares at $3. Looking for another new high next week.
"For those of you dealing with ""red stress"" today... flip to the one month, it will make you feel better."
