what caused this jump---anyone know
"Don’t want to spoil the party, however the reason there is no inventory in the stores is due to their credit."
how/why is this going up?
"Something is afoot | no sales announcements, no upgrades | nothing like this doubles, even on low volume, unless something is up | Their website is actually very well designed and favorable to eCommerce - Curbside Pickup, Household stuff people buy during quarantine. | I'm so happy I dumped it at $2 and now buying back in at $4 - let's take a shot |"

I posted 7 days ago that the Home Edit book just came out and with all the people home from Covid are prolly organizing with lack of other things to do and this is the source for so much needed as far as the type of containers needed. Kris Kardashian is promoting the book on Instagram doesn’t hurt either.
Container Store is down 7.72% to 3.11
Well maybe just maybe I will get my money back with this stock. Sure am a lot closer to that today then some months ago. Heck I would be happy just getting close to break even as I was down a TON. GL to all//////// God Bless America

"Listened to the Crames show and bought in high in the mid 11's. Saw todays led zepplin and so guess what, bought more today in the 9's. This is what you'd expect to see, people need some payback for their years of work. My trading goal is 2ish % a week and using that goal, yes this can be at $15 plus when the TV shows gain momentum. It'll be a longer positional stay than I wanted kind of, but the money will come. Been down this road trading before, the fast drops like today doesn't worry me. Quick downs are great indicators of longer term bullish."
Container Store reached a 52 Week high at 9.82
This is a buy
I am guessing that TCS is down in sympathy with BBBY. I could not find any other news.
Who is pumping this stock? It is way ahead of every analyst's target.
SMASHED EARNINGS!
"https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/closets/container-store-estimates-custom-closets-sales-rise-76CEO: We have executed difficult but necessary actions in managing our costs, while simultaneously maximizing the opportunities for our customers with our fully-integrated website, click & pickup/contactless curbside delivery service and in-store appointments in select stores. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, which began on March 29, online customer orders have nearly quadrupled the level of the prior year. While we are not providing financial guidance for fiscal 2020 at this time, with the strength of our online business and the swift cost actions we are implementing, I feel confident in our ability to successfully navigate this unprecedented environment"
Overbought!
Why is this board bone dry after positive earnings results?
TD SHOWS TCS OVER 35.00 WITHIN A WEEK
Held on to this stock for quite some time in anticipation that it would return to my purchase price. It took a couple of years and finally got there. Thank You and now Im out of this position. Lesson learned. Good luck to all.

"Went to a local TCS store in Nashville today. Tons of online pickup orders stacked high. Probably saw at least 200 bags, no joke. Not stopping people from shopping for sure."
Container Store reached a 52 Week high at 8.85
This one was a little hot. If it hits 13 again im in.
They already pulled it back so it's not like TCS is high before earnings and TCS as I see it is the cream of the crop for all kinds of containers and they even hook you up with California closets and lots of everything that is well made and the absolute best organizers under the sun
why is this crashing?
TCS is down -14.11% to 4.08

typical market manipulation. It will drop 4-5 for this round.
Container Store is down 14.77% to 3.29
My guess is short squeeze in combination with insider buying and low share float. Awesome!￼
I called AAPL today and now I'm calling TCS to be over 20.00 by tomorrow
TCS is down 31.34% to $6.90
Looking good!
Seen this coming from a mile away.
That’s what I like to call a smack down! They just beat the hell out of the numbers. Paid down principal senior note debt and and free cash flow insane! How about +15-20% tomorrow at open?!
good numbers today where's the bounce

What's the news today for going up? Can it go more than $5 by next week?
Under $9 after earnings release...

"Dilution soon, registration out now."
"Just over 10% of outstanding shares have traded so far today and I expect that less than 15% will trade by end of day. Not a huge movement of investors cashing out. Would be satisfied if price climbed up to closing price of Tuesday evening, although doubtful it might get close and that would be a good indicator that it can stay in the $10.00 range."
Why did they not have a stockholders meeting this year
Lot of deferred deliveries and installations in Q4. Means next qtr. will be much better. We'll hold a couple of qtrs. and add on dips. GLTA

"so i'm going to ask the same question i ask every year..... why are you still holding this stock?????? This is a DOG..... it's been around $5 a share for YEARS! Current PE of 40x1 and very very little growth..... They've been in business since the 1970's and still have just 80 stores nation wide. They are not growing new stores, comps have been flat for YEARS and they are losing market share to the web since NOTHING they sell is proprietary. Seriously why are you holding this stock? Just sell, take the tax loss, and get into something else. If you must own a retail stock there are a half dozen other retailers growing much faster which much more profit than TCS. Look at Fransisca's, casey's general store or Five below if you want a retailer growing both comps and store counts. Why own this other than trying to get back to even? I absolutely promise you this stock never gets back to $18 a share.... EVER! ."
What'd I miss? Why TCS poppin' today?
Will they start closing some stores soon?
Container Store reached a 52 Week high at 12.34
Pe = 142. It will decrease soon. Sell now and take your profit !!!
Why is there no board here?
Watch this tumble over the next week. Nothing to support it once the party mood wears off.
CEO just bought 50k shares..that's a great sign

"If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Container Store Group (NYSE:TCS) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Container Store Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.026 = US$24m ÷ (US$1.1b - US$193m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).Therefore, Container Store Group has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 9.6%.View our latest analysis for Container Store Group￼<img alt=""roce"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5k1hbC16yTA9.fB.O.cD4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/c43ce02054cb71372d10c2c79128c056"" class=""caas-img"">roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Container Store Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Container Store Group here for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Container Store Group Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Container Store Group doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 6.0% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Our Take On Container Store Group's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Container Store Group's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has declined 69% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."

"Stoped by my local TCS and notice that the store is clean organized and busy. Prices were a little high for my taste, but realize that they have some unique items that people in my part of town seem to see out and willing to pay the premium price. Don't understand why this stock doesn't do better."

Container Store reached a 52 Week high at 14.72
don't understand the run up in this stock. Other than the Netflix show sponsorship why is it at a 52 wk high? I bought at $2.08 so I am NOT complaining.
"O.k; the stock approached that 12.50 level seen in mid '18 so that is a natural level for some selling. People that bought back then can sell and say they didn't lose any money; so goes the logic. By the same token, breakout above that level would be off to the races. Looks to be backing and filling and getting ready to take on 12.50."
Container Store reached a 52 Week high at 13.99
ready to break out
Very soft volume recently. This company seems to be off the investors radar for now. Price seems to maintain upper to mid $5. range. Hopefully company does reasonably well with February Elfa sale season and they show decent results for first quarter 2018 earnings report to soldify a price position into the $6-7 /share price range.
TCS is up 10.20% to 4.97
Any reason for this drop? Earnings looked great. Never expected this.
10-K annual report just filed.
Is it possible to reach all time highs?
"I work for several organizers in a big city, every one of them fills closets with stuff from here. I install ELFA systems, and they are still churning out orders. They have always needed more store locations IMO, so maybe this flaw is their advantage in times like these."
Container Store is up 20.85% to 4.00
"Wonder why there’s almost always a big stock drop after Cramer pumps a stock? It’s because he’s about to take profits in his charitable contribution. Pump and dump. Quite the business man, help for the average trader, not so much."
Is this a prelude to a buyout? They would be an outstanding fit for Williams Sonoma.
I said about 2 months ago the home edit book came out and wondered what it would do to this stock.
Wild ride no doubt TCS but hit my goal. In retrospect this did better for me than appl fruits these last few weeks. I'll be watching for some big tv joy and the new ceo performance so maybe I'll be back. Off to some bogus 'hot air' hydrogen stuff for a little while. Best of luck to all here!

"I remember watching this ipo back in 2013 and wondered why someone would pay $40 for a retailer that had been around 30yrs, only had 100 stores, and only opening 3-4 new stores a year? Their growth rate was a weak 3-4%yr, the pe was 40x1 and EVERYTHING they sold was available online for half the price. So here we are 7yrs later, gotta love how right or wrong the market always provides an answer."

The Container Store is up 5.92% to 12.17
Underpriced. Earning estimates were $1.24 for the year before the beat Q1 by .27. That would put EPS at around $1.51 now for current year. Revenue is up for the quarter by 61.7% vs prior year. This stock should have a PE at around 20. It should be worth $30 a year.
