"TCS's PE is 35???? while apple is 15 and Ford is 10.8?If we make TCS's PE 10.8, then, TCS should be trading at $1.3 a share."
Underpriced. Earning estimates were $1.24 for the year before the beat Q1 by .27. That would put EPS at around $1.51 now for current year. Revenue is up for the quarter by 61.7% vs prior year. This stock should have a PE at around 20. It should be worth $30 a year.

New 52 week high and still no news about what is going on. not complaining. if TCS wants to continue to go up without some obvious reason it is ok with me. I am still down but every little bit helps///////// God Bless America

"Just over 10% of outstanding shares have traded so far today and I expect that less than 15% will trade by end of day. Not a huge movement of investors cashing out. Would be satisfied if price climbed up to closing price of Tuesday evening, although doubtful it might get close and that would be a good indicator that it can stay in the $10.00 range."

"I remember watching this ipo back in 2013 and wondered why someone would pay $40 for a retailer that had been around 30yrs, only had 100 stores, and only opening 3-4 new stores a year? Their growth rate was a weak 3-4%yr, the pe was 40x1 and EVERYTHING they sold was available online for half the price. So here we are 7yrs later, gotta love how right or wrong the market always provides an answer."
"I remember this retailers IPO in late 2013... i remember thinking ""why would anyone invest in this thing?"" They had very little organic growth of opening just 2-3% new stores a year, it was such a niche market that could easily see their very high prices undercut by online sellers, and they had a massive amount of debt.... I watched it go from IPO price of 28 to 40 and laughed as i wondered wy people who apparently can't correctly value a stock would buy at $40.... , then of course it's been four years of losing 90% of it's value and trades at $4. Then last week i went into a store just to check it out and see if anything had changed.... nothing had... except i saw a shelf of the founders autobiography for sale... on the cover there is a quote that says ""How Passion, Commitment, and Conscious Capitalism Built a Business Where Everyone Thrives"" and i literally laughed out loud enough that a clerk looked my way. Literally if that clerk hadn't have seen me pick up the book and laugh i'd have pulled out a pen and written under that quote on the cover: ""except the shareholders, the shareholders got hosed""......."

Very soft volume recently. This company seems to be off the investors radar for now. Price seems to maintain upper to mid $5. range. Hopefully company does reasonably well with February Elfa sale season and they show decent results for first quarter 2018 earnings report to soldify a price position into the $6-7 /share price range.
Lot of deferred deliveries and installations in Q4. Means next qtr. will be much better. We'll hold a couple of qtrs. and add on dips. GLTA

"Scroll down.... I posted this s year ago and apparently I’m still correct! ..... “so i'm going to ask the same question i ask every year..... why are you still holding this stock?????? This is a DOG..... it's been around $5 a share for YEARS! Current PE of 40x1 and very very little growth..... They've been in business since the 1970's and still have just 80 stores nation wide. They are not growing new stores, comps have been flat for YEARS and they are losing market share to the web since NOTHING they sell is proprietary. Seriously why are you holding this stock? Just sell, take the tax loss, and get into something else. If you must own a retail stock there are a half dozen other retailers growing much faster which much more profit than TCS. Look at Fransisca's, casey's general store or Five below if you want a retailer growing both comps and store counts. Why own this other than trying to get back to even? I absolutely promise you this stock never gets back to $18 a share.... EVER! .”"
Down to $4 Totally played by insiders
"If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Container Store Group (NYSE:TCS) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Container Store Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.026 = US$24m ÷ (US$1.1b - US$193m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2020).Therefore, Container Store Group has an ROCE of 2.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Specialty Retail industry average of 9.6%.View our latest analysis for Container Store Group￼<img alt=""roce"" src=""https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5k1hbC16yTA9.fB.O.cD4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/c43ce02054cb71372d10c2c79128c056"" class=""caas-img"">roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Container Store Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Container Store Group here for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Container Store Group Tell Us?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Container Store Group doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 6.0% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Our Take On Container Store Group's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Container Store Group's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has declined 69% over the last five years, investors may not be too optimistic on this trend improving either. In any case, the stock doesn't have these traits of a multi-bagger discussed above, so if that's what you're looking for, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."

"Don’t want to spoil the party, however the reason there is no inventory in the stores is due to their credit."
The container store in my area is only near the best malls where there is a lot of money to spend. Last time I went to TCS I spent over $600.00 They present merchandise very nicely
"Gains every quarter, easy safe long term stock."
Wild ride no doubt TCS but hit my goal. In retrospect this did better for me than appl fruits these last few weeks. I'll be watching for some big tv joy and the new ceo performance so maybe I'll be back. Off to some bogus 'hot air' hydrogen stuff for a little while. Best of luck to all here!

They already pulled it back so it's not like TCS is high before earnings and TCS as I see it is the cream of the crop for all kinds of containers and they even hook you up with California closets and lots of everything that is well made and the absolute best organizers under the sun

"Listened to the Crames show and bought in high in the mid 11's. Saw todays led zepplin and so guess what, bought more today in the 9's. This is what you'd expect to see, people need some payback for their years of work. My trading goal is 2ish % a week and using that goal, yes this can be at $15 plus when the TV shows gain momentum. It'll be a longer positional stay than I wanted kind of, but the money will come. Been down this road trading before, the fast drops like today doesn't worry me. Quick downs are great indicators of longer term bullish."
