"https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/closets/container-store-estimates-custom-closets-sales-rise-76CEO: We have executed difficult but necessary actions in managing our costs, while simultaneously maximizing the opportunities for our customers with our fully-integrated website, click & pickup/contactless curbside delivery service and in-store appointments in select stores. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, which began on March 29, online customer orders have nearly quadrupled the level of the prior year. While we are not providing financial guidance for fiscal 2020 at this time, with the strength of our online business and the swift cost actions we are implementing, I feel confident in our ability to successfully navigate this unprecedented environment"
"""Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Container Store Group Inc (TCS)"" Boy, you wouldn't know it by the price action."
the down trend has started... none stop until 9-9.50
"With home building/remodeling going strong..they should do well going forward. My daughter just used them to remodel two of her closets, they did a real nice job. The design was done with their online line website."
don't understand the run up in this stock. Other than the Netflix show sponsorship why is it at a 52 wk high? I bought at $2.08 so I am NOT complaining.
"Something is afoot | no sales announcements, no upgrades | nothing like this doubles, even on low volume, unless something is up | Their website is actually very well designed and favorable to eCommerce - Curbside Pickup, Household stuff people buy during quarantine. | I'm so happy I dumped it at $2 and now buying back in at $4 - let's take a shot |"
how/why is this going up?

"I work for several organizers in a big city, every one of them fills closets with stuff from here. I install ELFA systems, and they are still churning out orders. They have always needed more store locations IMO, so maybe this flaw is their advantage in times like these."
"Stoped by my local TCS and notice that the store is clean organized and busy. Prices were a little high for my taste, but realize that they have some unique items that people in my part of town seem to see out and willing to pay the premium price. Don't understand why this stock doesn't do better."
"Listened to the Crames show and bought in high in the mid 11's. Saw todays led zepplin and so guess what, bought more today in the 9's. This is what you'd expect to see, people need some payback for their years of work. My trading goal is 2ish % a week and using that goal, yes this can be at $15 plus when the TV shows gain momentum. It'll be a longer positional stay than I wanted kind of, but the money will come. Been down this road trading before, the fast drops like today doesn't worry me. Quick downs are great indicators of longer term bullish."
"Dilution soon, registration out now."

My guess is short squeeze in combination with insider buying and low share float. Awesome!ï¿¼
Underpriced. Earning estimates were $1.24 for the year before the beat Q1 by .27. That would put EPS at around $1.51 now for current year. Revenue is up for the quarter by 61.7% vs prior year. This stock should have a PE at around 20. It should be worth $30 a year.
"Whether the report later today is good or not, I still believe in your long term potential TCS!"
What'd I miss? Why TCS poppin' today?
I am guessing that TCS is down in sympathy with BBBY. I could not find any other news.
Is there any news about the company that I missed? what is going on!!!!
