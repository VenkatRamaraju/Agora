"Today, AliCloud launches Dingding - first digital after-school service platform which connects education bureaus, schools, parents and students and third party education service institutions through DingTalk.. Another great news from BABA to revamp the education industry in China."
"Just an excerpt: At the same time, it should not be forgotten that potential future cash flow implies a discount of about 300% to Alibaba's current market price."
It's amazing to me how much energy gets wasted on Jimmy Z. Just mute him and move on. I haven't seen his posts for months.
When BABA BIDU start turning around you may see 20-25% in a hurry!
"Finally, beginning to outperform KWEB again, after bad month.Watch out shorts. HA HA HA! After an index sell-off of this magnitude, bounce is typically 25%.That will take BABA to $200."
"10,000 at 164.oo. ave, hope to retire nicely in 2 years at least"
One of the few undervalued stocks right now all of tech is out of touch with reality.
"Per MarketInsider:-With market cap for VIE-structured firms so large, it is less likely that this* would be done abruptly by Chinese regulators who prize stability. -In particular, after the education debacle, the education minister was quietly relieved of his duty as party secretary, a de facto face-saving demotion that signaled his complete exit will happen soon. -Any other minister who is pondering any type of shock-and-awe regulation now knows there is a career risk. *referring to a ""hard cap"" on foreign ownership"
One day soon this will have a $15.00-$20.00 up day. And you will wish you bought more in the 150-160's
"Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, decreased to RMB20,683 million (US$3,203 million), from RMB36,570 million in the same quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decreases were mainly due to thepartial settlement in the amount of RMB9,114 million (US$1,412 million) of the RMB18,228 million Antimonopoly Fine and a decrease in profit as a result of our investments in key strategic areas. The partial settlement of 1.4B? Did they only pay half the fine so far?"
"It is just a start, BABA is going to rise UP fast coming, Buy BABA asap and Hold !"
"Start red and finish green. It has been ages. Rally is about to start. September end: $200October: $222November: $280December: over $300We all know.SHORTS, you had your fair time of fun, now give it to us. No hard feeling after all, it’s our sweat money.To the moon!"
"Wouldn't be surprised if BABA is down another 5-10% within the next two weeks once an additional statement is released regarding ""regulator crackdowns."" Seems every week or so there's new regulations on some aspect of Chinese business. I honestly don't think the pace of regulation can continue much longer (maybe through 1Q2022).If you believe BABA can continue to grow through ongoing regulations current prices are a buy in my opinion. I expect high levels of volatility to continue until regulatory concerns surpass.The next year of earnings will be the deciding factor of long term price appreciation / depreciation simply because it will show whether BABA can continue to grow at a high pace or not. Look at what happened to JD's stock price after last quarters earnings release. Yes there are risks with the VIE structure. That is something you need to decide on for yourself. In my opinion, I view the risk as low. China relies heavily on foreign financial markets for capital. The Chinese would be committing economic suicide by voiding VIE contracts. Think about global backlash. China is an exporting economy in terms of manufacturing and imports a large majority of its energy and agricultural needs. If the globe decides to cut China out, their economy would crumble.I opened a position at $210 per ADR. Being patient and committed to your analysis is more important than short term noise. Mutual funds and ETFs are pressured to compete against one another on a quarterly and annual performance record. Individuals should be more concerned about long term CAGR returns on their portfolio. If BABA shows it can continue to grow Wall Street will turn extremely bullish and completely flip the narrative.I plan on holding for years if growth continues."
When will the Alibaba buyback shares process start? Any thoughts?
"What bears fail to tell everyone is a lot of AMZN product are from BABA. BABA sells in bulk on the cheap. People can talk down all they want about BABA, the people who take the time to research will be rewarded. Good day!"
"Should have been up more today. The ccp gaming news was fud and when investors realized a version of this law has been around since 2019 and will have minimal impact. Shares recovered. A lot of these ccp regulations are common sense and similar to issues in western countries and good companies like baba adjust. China stocks will reflect fundamentals soon, but always at a discount because China does business differently, but do they? I the end companies want to make money"
"Just what chart looks like now IMO: October 200 January 218 May 225 July 52 week high will show 229.64 so to break through that new area past July a breakout. Going by ranges on 3,6,12 month charts from here top range areas in those months without breakouts."
Holding strong with a cost basis of $212. I've got diamond hands because the fundamentals are on my side.
The revenue Numbers are staggering high incomprehensible and how much this company is into. Potential is so large for the technicals that all is being done to hold down; any moment day week month or year this can be catapulted to parabolic levels & along with hype and media ￼exploitation to also mention as well HK popularity tech icon be prominent status quo rank position equity
"Seeking Alpha: ""Alibaba: We've Reached The Bottom, The Time To Buy Is Now"" Thesis: ""There’s an indication that the political pressure from Beijing against Alibaba is likely going to ease in the following quarters. /Alibaba has more than enough catalysts that should help it to create additional shareholder value in the foreseeable future. / We believe that Alibaba’s stock has reached its bottom and recently we opened a long position in the company."""
"Seeking Alpha: ""Alibaba: A Coiled Spring. Alibaba has seen its shares drop by more than 40% over the last year, which destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars in equity value. This was, however, not driven by operational issues or declining profits. Instead, the company continues to execute well and growth remains strong, and Alibaba's weak share price performance was entirely driven by market sentiment. Right now, the market worries a lot about regulation in China and potential delistings for Chinese stocks in the US, but I believe these fears are overblown. If the market eventually comes to the same conclusion, Alibaba would have massive upside potential, especially since buybacks have recently been ramped up, which should help support shares in the coming months."""

Morgan Stanley picks out high-conviction China stocks https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/31/morgan-stanley-picks-out-high-conviction-china-stocks.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboardMorgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Allibaba.
"Your sources of news in US about China and other parts around world are very limited, a lot is fake news.. Whats going on with alibaba and others have nothing to do with Chinese government or so called ""commies"" being against free market economy and trying to destroy it.What China have been trying to do is finnaly take care of all fake listings on alibaba, fake feedbacks/reviews and fake companies with counterfeit products. Last year alone more then 1.7 trilion counterfeit and fake listing have been found on alibaba and taboa! Hundreds of thousands buyers lost their money...Try to do this here in US on eBay or Amazon.Mr. MA and others have been warned hundreds of times to address the issue, which they ignored for years.In the end it will be much safer and more transparent marketplaces for all across the world.Is that what investors want?"
"Really hard to understand why anybody would sell this here, unless they had a margin call"
good upwards consolidation. should give more confidence to buyers
"Articles this week about expansions in Saudi Arabia tourist sector, a direct freight route to Korea, and new Zealand expansion. Korea one seems big these other two smaller impactZuru Edge has begun selling its Dose & Co range of collagen products into China using Alibaba’s Tmall Global sales platform.Zuru Edge is owned by Zuru, the toy business started in a shed on a Waikato farm in 2004, which grew to being the world's sixth-biggest toymaker selling toys including booty-shaking llamas, rainbocorns and huge bunches of water balloons.But the company, which now has its head office in China’s “Silicon Valley” Shenzhen, has been expanding into fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), which has helped push its annual turnover past $1.4 billion a year.New Zealand companies are increasingly using Alibaba's Tmall to sell their wares into China’s vast and growing economy, or to find products to import and sell here."
Finally! This is a good look for the rest of the week
this is atleast a $220 stock wayy oversold
"This investing opportunity is quitte simple:Alibaba has 73 Billion USD cash or 26.50 USD per share. If cash is subtracted from the current stockprice, you effectively pay only 133 USD per Alibaba share with 30% growth and a P/E of around 13. An extremely low valuation, everyone agrees on that one, but is it justified? CCP Regulation will diminish growth probably a bit, but even in the extreme scenario that there is no growth anymore, the valuation is still cheap for this cash cow. So the only question relevant is: do you think CCP or SEC will delist Alibaba? Some believe it and that’s why the stockprice is low and currently sold out. Personally I believe both the CCP as well as the SEC/USA have to many stakes in the fire and will keep the stock trading on Wall Street and I absolutely don’t believe delisting will occur. If you believe it will get delisted, you should not buy Alibaba shares. If you don’t believe it will delist, you have your opportunity to buy shares for a very cheap price and although it can be stormy for a little longer, it’s value will come to fruition in the stockprice over time. Good luck and just ask yourself the above question and you now if you should buy or not. Like I said, it’s quitte simple."

"On the algorithm rules, Alibaba $BABA Taobao already allows you to see which ad-related tags the platform gives you and remove them for 6 months at a time. The tags are personalized and quite extensive. I really doubt people adjust it that much? How many of you adjust your Facebook ad options?Finally, you can turn off all personalized recommendations in Taobao (or other Chinese e-commerce apps). That was required by law since 2019 as I mentioned earlier."
BABA prediction was +3%. Actual is +1.8%.Not bad at all.BABA prediction tomorrow is +4%.
