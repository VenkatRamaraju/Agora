If you have anywhere above 15-20% invested in China This would be good article to read:https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/05/chinas-attempt-to-avoid-the-american-tech-monopoly-trap/
"Finally, beginning to outperform KWEB again, after bad month.Watch out shorts. HA HA HA! After an index sell-off of this magnitude, bounce is typically 25%.That will take BABA to $200."
"Articles this week about expansions in Saudi Arabia tourist sector, a direct freight route to Korea, and new Zealand expansion. Korea one seems big these other two smaller impactZuru Edge has begun selling its Dose & Co range of collagen products into China using Alibaba’s Tmall Global sales platform.Zuru Edge is owned by Zuru, the toy business started in a shed on a Waikato farm in 2004, which grew to being the world's sixth-biggest toymaker selling toys including booty-shaking llamas, rainbocorns and huge bunches of water balloons.But the company, which now has its head office in China’s “Silicon Valley” Shenzhen, has been expanding into fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), which has helped push its annual turnover past $1.4 billion a year.New Zealand companies are increasingly using Alibaba's Tmall to sell their wares into China’s vast and growing economy, or to find products to import and sell here."
Made Jimmy Zs life savings off of BABA and Amazon today
BABA 1000 usd/share this decade! STRONG BUY the numbers are extremely good!
"According to technical analysis of the chart, the stock has been trending downward."
Kathy Wood should be investigated!!!One week ago she said Chinese stocks are Uninvestable!! Now she is buying?? Obviously her intent was to scare people into selling their shares and driving price down. It appears her intent from the beginning was to simply get shares at much lower prices!! SEC should investigate!!
"If cloud news and e-commerce news didnt push this back to 52 week low, what will?"
"9988 closed at $152.10 = $156.97 ... so HK will be green tonight, virtually guaranteed due to arbitrage ... Baba had a nice optic from closing > $161 on V that is 4x average ... AH could be very interesting, and I would not be surprised if NYSE opens at $164 tomorrow"
"Does everybody agree this stock always seems to close all the technical gaps? It always does, and the thing is, it will open $5 or more higher but then there will be an opening gap to fill sometime, whether it be this week or whatever."
"Feels like someone knows something based on afternoon and overseas trading action yesterday. What would an approval and confirmed date for an Alipay IPO do for the stock? I think we'd gap up to 40 to 50 points easy.Whatever it is, I see blue skies and cold margaritas by the pool in front of us...."
"Just an excerpt: At the same time, it should not be forgotten that potential future cash flow implies a discount of about 300% to Alibaba's current market price."
"Ok so let me put some perspective here about whats happening on higher level. Big fund managers and investment firms are under pressure to bring high returns for their clients and take advantage of US free money printing and distribution. So what they do - they pull out of China and pour everything in US overvalued stocks. Now they also want retailers not to take advantage of their selling in Chinese equities so that when time comes they can switch from US to China with ease and cheaper valuations. So what they do - they start blogging negative news about Chinese regulations and what not. If you smart enough, you would not fall for this. Buy up these great value stocks like baba and Tencent and hold. Patience!"
Delisting fears have been lowered thanks to some audit cooperation. Next will be removing some china tariffs and trade war as one of the few effective ways to fight inflation. Then ANT which will push baba from the underperformer to the outperformer
"China Daily, this morning 26.08.2021""Personal information and important data collected and produced by the operators within the Chinese mainland should be stored on the mainland, according to the regulation. Security assessments will be needed if a business has to provide such data overseas.""Guess who is going to benefit from this?!Correct, Alibaba Cloud business"
"Alibaba: This May Be The Perfect Time To Go All-In""Alibaba is expected to have 1.11T Chinese Yuan ($171.5B) in revenues next year, which means revenues will grow 20% Y/Y… more than twice the projected market growth rate in global e-commerce. Given the higher-than-market growth rate and strong positioning in e-commerce, Alibaba’s market-capitalization and P-E ratio are low at 2.5 and 14.7. Compared to Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba’s biggest rival outside China, Alibaba’s projected sales and profit growth provide better value."" SA"
"it's concerning, its peer JD at least had a decent rebound, baba cannot even restore the level before this round sell off, data shows huge retail investor flooded in, I guess still lack of big players...it's not a good sign...we need major good news to reverse this, hope we dont see new lows...."
"This investing opportunity is quitte simple:Alibaba has 73 Billion USD cash or 26.50 USD per share. If cash is subtracted from the current stockprice, you effectively pay only 133 USD per Alibaba share with 30% growth and a P/E of around 13. An extremely low valuation, everyone agrees on that one, but is it justified? CCP Regulation will diminish growth probably a bit, but even in the extreme scenario that there is no growth anymore, the valuation is still cheap for this cash cow. So the only question relevant is: do you think CCP or SEC will delist Alibaba? Some believe it and that’s why the stockprice is low and currently sold out. Personally I believe both the CCP as well as the SEC/USA have to many stakes in the fire and will keep the stock trading on Wall Street and I absolutely don’t believe delisting will occur. If you believe it will get delisted, you should not buy Alibaba shares. If you don’t believe it will delist, you have your opportunity to buy shares for a very cheap price and although it can be stormy for a little longer, it’s value will come to fruition in the stockprice over time. Good luck and just ask yourself the above question and you now if you should buy or not. Like I said, it’s quitte simple."
"Per MarketInsider:-With market cap for VIE-structured firms so large, it is less likely that this* would be done abruptly by Chinese regulators who prize stability. -In particular, after the education debacle, the education minister was quietly relieved of his duty as party secretary, a de facto face-saving demotion that signaled his complete exit will happen soon. -Any other minister who is pondering any type of shock-and-awe regulation now knows there is a career risk. *referring to a ""hard cap"" on foreign ownership"
"Since April 1, 2021 and through the publication of this results announcement, we repurchased approximately18.1 million of our ADSs (the equivalent of approximately 144.5 million of our ordinary shares) forapproximately US$3,680 million under our share repurchase program. In addition, on August 2, 2021, ourboard of directors authorized the Company to upsize our Company's share repurchase program from US$10billion to US$15 billion. This share repurchase program will be effective through the end of 2022."
Many Chinese people also own shares of Alibaba and this is biggest part of the Market Cap. The chines government will not rob it's own people: otherwise it could cause unnecessary anger: nobody want it. So relax: it's temporal fear.
"The best time to buy BABA is just before September and hold through Singles Day, which continues to generate impressive record-setting sales year over year. The deliberately misrepresented news of CCR regulation over the past few days has given us a tremendous buying opportunity to scoop up more shares of BABA at bargain prices."
How big of Baba's cloud business comes from the public sector? The Reuters article on asking the public sector to migrate their data away from private cloud companies to state-backed by next year gets me worried.
if you look at a chart of companies that made investors a lot of money like AMZN NVDA MSFT and many others you will see that there was a period of time sometimes years that they did not do anything after they became public and then they exploded to the upside. I think long-term BABA holders will be rewarded.
Jimmy Z make so much noise here. You from India?  got the delta covid virus ? Better earn more for oxygen . Your country have shortage

"the short term looks hopeless, have to look into next year, one thing is xi's second term is ending then and will be big power struggle among ccp from top the bottom, dont think people have time to worry about tech firms then...also if baba can continue to deliver solid earning in the next 3 q, then all these concerns will be gone naturally, hope you dont have a margin call or too much leverage so you can play the long game"

good upwards consolidation. should give more confidence to buyers
"For the record I own JD to, its a great company. No PDD tho, don't know enough about it. I compared Financials just to compare. Looking good today for baba"

I'm in with 500 shares at a price of $172.56. I feel pretty good about BABA reaching its highs by next year...
"WallStreetBets Reddit news:Root Inc. (NASDAQ:ROOT), Corsair Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ:CRSR), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and Globalstar Inc. (NYSE:GSAT) are among the stocks seeing the highest interest on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum as of early Thursday."
Holding strong with a cost basis of $212. I've got diamond hands because the fundamentals are on my side.
The way I see BABA right now is that it will trade at current levels for awhile as growth fund managers sell their shares to value managers. There are a lot of shares that need to transfer and value folks wont chase higher. Will likely become a different shareholder base. Not much the company can do about that. Their only possible offset will be to announce a share buyback or even offer a very small dividend. It won't cause the stock to bounce back very much but it could solidify the current new shareholder base and expand potential buyers.
"Most institutions have sold out the majority of their position in alibaba, . Also, Vanda Research said in a Wednesday note, e-commerce behemoth Alibaba was the most bought single stock in the US last couple days. It said, Retail investors have bought $400 million of US-listed Chinese stocks this week, the largest inflow from individual traders in 5 years. I expect we are going to see a reverse course soon"

People should be happy with gift of current China stock prices. This is similar to the COVID drop and pop.
"Be greedy when others are fearful.""Shares of Alibaba and other top China tech essentially got debased during the latest round of the selloff.Alibaba's valuation crashed to a rock bottom 13 times forward earnings, and its RSI cratered to below 20 for the first time.Yes, there's some uncertainty, but Alibaba has been trading like the company is going out of business.Alibaba is remarkably inexpensive, and once the regulatory risk premium starts to get priced out of the share price again, the company's stock should move a lot higher.""

"Ill personally give Jimmy Z $1,000 if he will do a financial breakdown of any company. He couldn't do it to save his life!HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
Everyone in here seems like a short … I’m still buying  long term bull in this stock
With 60M shares traded yesterday at day max premium this is a very lite % pullback and these movements can permit short squeezes for aggressive long term hold gains 8-18 months & breakout over each when reached 200MDA then 52 week high levels on the 12 month chart as well
"Bloomberg, it's over. Shorts cover as it's going to be a fast ride back up. Value ALWAYS rises to the top. On to higher highs..."
This is c n b c news .Chinese stocks mixed as data shows China’s factory activity growth slowed in August. Though in reality if you look at the numbers there is 770 point swing in the HSI from day low to day hi; a lot of it occurred in the last five minutes of trading and also what is important it broke its five day average. that’sthe real news￼
I dont know why my posts keep getting deleted but I will try one more time.Apparently China’s state assets watchdog has ordered its firms to accelerate data migration from cloud services by tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent to the government’s own infrastructure. Being reported this weekend.
I can't believe how cheap BABA is. Glad I picked some up in the low $150s. See ya'll at $200+ soon!
The uptrend wave has already began. Don’t miss the train longs
"A few points for thought: 1) If there was any risk to business, do you think Jack Ma would have approved 15b buy back?2) There will be huge reduction in expenses for education, and according to China Daily the main intent behind it to bust consumer spending. Guess where all these saved money will be spent. Correct, primarily e-commerce 3) China Daily (CCP propaganda tool) today was bragging that Goldman and Ray Dalio are buying Alibaba? Would they brag about that if CCP interested in suppressing BABA4) CEO mentioned earlier that in the future Cloud is going to be primary business, now guess what scale of growth they see there if today its only 8% of revenueThis is an opportunity of life timeI keep selling my US positions to accumulate more of this. Short term is irrelevant"
No good news share price up is a good sign. Patience is the key.
Buying my last 10 shares of BABA today. That will finish building my position to 500 shares which I plan to hold for decades. Isn’t it weird how the bashers on here seem too care so much about other people’s money? Very strange…
"The company launched an internal probe after her demonstration was captured on video and viewed millions of times online. Alibaba later publicly reprimanded its head of human resources, set up a hotline for sexual harassment complaints and created a high-level committee to resolve future disputes. I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/vsvx4y ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them."
Looking good! Atm
"Focus on the business, not the daily price fluctuations. Money is still going to flow to China but just with a bigger discount rate due to political risks."
"In terms of AliBaba’s business operations, you might just say they are as strong as ever despite the ongoing government crackdowns. AliBaba’s logistics arm, Cainiao, announced earlier in the week that the company is establishing a direct sea trading route with South Korea. This will dramatically cut down on shipping times for Koreans who order from AliExpress, which saw a near 100% increase year over year in the first half of 2021. The route will cut down on shipping and travel costs for AliBaba by an estimated 30%."
"Wouldn't be surprised if BABA is down another 5-10% within the next two weeks once an additional statement is released regarding ""regulator crackdowns."" Seems every week or so there's new regulations on some aspect of Chinese business. I honestly don't think the pace of regulation can continue much longer (maybe through 1Q2022).If you believe BABA can continue to grow through ongoing regulations current prices are a buy in my opinion. I expect high levels of volatility to continue until regulatory concerns surpass.The next year of earnings will be the deciding factor of long term price appreciation / depreciation simply because it will show whether BABA can continue to grow at a high pace or not. Look at what happened to JD's stock price after last quarters earnings release. Yes there are risks with the VIE structure. That is something you need to decide on for yourself. In my opinion, I view the risk as low. China relies heavily on foreign financial markets for capital. The Chinese would be committing economic suicide by voiding VIE contracts. Think about global backlash. China is an exporting economy in terms of manufacturing and imports a large majority of its energy and agricultural needs. If the globe decides to cut China out, their economy would crumble.I opened a position at $210 per ADR. Being patient and committed to your analysis is more important than short term noise. Mutual funds and ETFs are pressured to compete against one another on a quarterly and annual performance record. Individuals should be more concerned about long term CAGR returns on their portfolio. If BABA shows it can continue to grow Wall Street will turn extremely bullish and completely flip the narrative.I plan on holding for years if growth continues."
"Looking for PE at the company like BABA with a huge cashpile is not representative at all.Example: A company with market cap of 500B USD and 400B USD cash in hand making 10B net income a year.PE for that company will be 50 but in fact, but it is so missleading.A healthy metric for a company with such a strong balance of cash is: EV/EBITDAEV = Market Capitalization + Market Value of Debt – Cash and Equivalents (for BABA = 397b)EBITDA = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (for BABA = 26b)Hence, trailing EV/EBITDA for BABA equals: 397b/26b = 15.2For 2022, this value will be: 367b/30b = 12 (The reason for EV to drop from 397b to 367b is because they would have generated another 30b which will reduce their EV by 30b)For 2023, this value will be: 331b/36b = 9.19Meaning that the whole business will pay off in 9 years with 0% growth in earingings from 2023 onward.Disclaimer: Earning projection for 2022 and 2023 is taken from nasdaq.Think about the scale of this opportunity."
Well somethings up; could be new trade talk news soon or even EV news  
Get over $170.00 this week and we have bottomed out. Will be blue skies above. Good luck.
"159, or the 50% retracement level has held up again. Let's see what happens"
"Seeking Alpha: ""Alibaba: A Coiled Spring. Alibaba has seen its shares drop by more than 40% over the last year, which destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars in equity value. This was, however, not driven by operational issues or declining profits. Instead, the company continues to execute well and growth remains strong, and Alibaba's weak share price performance was entirely driven by market sentiment. Right now, the market worries a lot about regulation in China and potential delistings for Chinese stocks in the US, but I believe these fears are overblown. If the market eventually comes to the same conclusion, Alibaba would have massive upside potential, especially since buybacks have recently been ramped up, which should help support shares in the coming months."""
Long BABA
Chinese investors starting to buy alibaba stock in hong kong market. There is a meeting in between regulators and alibaba this past weekend. Stock is trading way higher at 162.5 in hk market. This will be the huge rebound for alibaba. Keep buying. Will go to 200 in a short period of time
"EOW expect BABA at USD 180 easy, I have notified you yesterday on the reversal and even today is a good entry point. FUD will nog be able to bash BABA anymore, Big Bucks are buying this with ease. Be with the Big buyers, the trend is your friend ;)"
Congratulations to those contrarians that picked up shares today in the 152 range. Long Baba.
Shorts are playing with fire. this stock will gain at least 10 percent when the china government say that they will no further regulation restriction. RSI is below 20 and stock price at multi year low. Alibaba might announce stock buy back. Buy more and hodl!
How difficult can it be for yahoo to detect those discord spam links and automatically remove?
Why are there so many articles in the left-wing media that uses the word “crackdown”? It seems like everything is a crackdown￼.
Will be interesting there was tech action HK last night …. Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent and Netease will be watched by investors on Tuesday after new rules published Monday by China’s National Press and Publication Administration showed plans to limit the time that those under 18 years spend playing video games to just three hours a week.
"Btw, what’s up with the 1y target price of 1.784,34? Any thoughts? Thanks"
Great BABA is back!
When traders come back after Labor Day weekend & going into the last quarter and the first quarter of next year to show large percentage gains the stocks with great fundamentals high volume low PEs and oversold conditions will be purchased to add to the last quarter & 1st Qtr to make great gains into all of 2022￼￼
BABA prediction was +3%. Actual is +1.8%.Not bad at all.BABA prediction tomorrow is +4%.
"Right now the odds are against the shorts, shorties should reassess their positions at such bottom now.. It is riskier to short at these prices now.."
Bought calls eod Friday. Have a good feeling this week we run
“Alibaba’s robots will be able to make the trip without deviations or smoke breaks.”Last nights article in Futurism
Interesting as Alibaba has some positive momentum media Bloomberg already has a story against.
Other Chinese tech companies are releasing their earnings reports and the fear in the market is beginning to turn into greed.
"Very interested to see what happens final hour and tomorrow, BABA has only had a small handful of three consecutive green days and this low volume doesn’t help any."
"Let's just all wait for the media to start the next news cycle. The CCP has openly admitted they will allow Chinese companies to list in the US. The US won't delist, because it would show the US isn't a free market. It's all nonsense and the result will be free money for those who understand the reality of the situation. I'm with Charlie Munger."

"Folks, i see funds are collecting and Hedges are getting squeezed and buying back as well."
"BABA has more potential than Amazon. People can't imagine how big China is compared to the U.S, and how Chinese middle class will grow economically. Can't see why this stock can't be at least $3.000 USD/share in 10-15 years."

There is no Chinese law that stops people from buying stuff from Alibaba’s online stores and using its cloud business…. Why are you worried about some new rules that European and US have also implemented!

Bloomberg has been quiet lets see what they have been cooking up
"If we account for the currency and inflation, then BABA is up 20 % since the IPO but the business has grown a 1000 %."
"Every day on these low levels is perfect for the amount of Alibaba shares that will be bought back. I never expected it to fall this deep, but now I hope Alibaba can buy back 80-90 million shares before the end of 2022. I expect the share price to slowly move up, no big spikes because retail will keep buying calls and will never be rewarded. So just buy shares and enjoy the slow but steady move up."

"Steve Weiss's rant against BABA just now on CNBC has finally convinced me to go long the stock. The man is a perfect reverse barometer. The man has a long history of buying up and shorting low. He gets lucky sometimes, but only when he is not emotional about a stock. He is emotional about BABA, which guarantees he will get caught badly in his short position. I'm going long for a 2 or 3 year hold. If the stock of BABA fails, then the entire Chinese economy has already failed first. Possible/not likely. Worth the risk at these prices."
Alibaba is soaring in Hong Kong market after Xi jinping speech. It looks like we are getting good news. We might soar 20 percent this week! Buy premarket or at open today. We are moving upward!
Remember we've had to endure 7 days of non stop selling orchestrated by shorts. Going up might be slower (unless short squeeze) than coming down but we're definitely going back up. We've got multiple gaps to fill. Lets take one gap at a time but do not oppose multi gap fills either.
"Seems like this bucks the trends - if Nas is up, then this is down, if NAS is down, then this is up. I still believe this is a $300 stock and if China can have any good news, this stock flies again."

BTW we set the tone for BABA SP and HK follows which they did. CCP privacy data regulatory news is almost coming to an end. Becoming more clear it's to protect people's privacy rather than kill companies that put China on the map. In fact most of regulations are good for communist country's citizens. May affect companies like BABA some but definitely not to the point of 40-50% of haircut in SP. Investors are going to start looking at as a value play as did Cathy wood.
"FWIW: interesting CPP story on the importance of a growing and stable software/IT sector ... does the CPP want to help Baba/JD/etc or hurt them, draw your own conclusions of coursehttp://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0829/c90000-9889331.html"
Hongkong 9988 gain a lot today. Baba is going to 171.
Alibaba did not file for bankrupcy according to latest data.
Good finish. Now it’s time for China to show up
Why is baba going lower. All other Chinese stocks are flat or up? Baba has so much cash flow
$180-$190 quickly!
BABA is the most undervalued stock in the entire market. Upside potential is huge. Easy 2 to 3 bagger for those who hold. If you can stomach the short term gyrations in price you will be vastly rewarded.
"Unless we get some serious bad news, the 150s are gone forever, no gaps left behind. Hopefully you bought a little in there"
Apocalypse is fairly priced in with BABA. This is a steal of a deal value investment even with zero growth in earnings and revenue going forward.
"Don't confuse value with trading. The recent price action, while nice, is just one part of the broader picture: Chinese sentiment is changing.Cathy woods has gone from ""I can't own chinese stocks"" to ""Let's buy some cheap chinese stocks""BABA is worth $300. Don't forget that."
"If al gore and prince Harry start buying, I’m all in"
Stock Market is a forward looking mechanism. Watch this go up just in the anticipation of regulators easing up. Buying here if you have a 1yr time horizon is a no brainer.
"Regardless of the status of the market as a whole, it always creates huge discounts, you just have to look for them. This time it's BABA. No brainer play. Load up as much as you can. I'm in with 100 shares at $162."
"Hey guys, I've been using yahoo finance for quite some time now, but just started an account today due to the massive FUD going on here. Now that they're blocked this should be a much better community now. Anyways, holding 300 shares at $190 and keep buying the dip. This company is trading with a 45% discount and is growing like crazy. The future is $BABA"
"Regardless of your position, When can we see 200 again? Need this happen soon…."
"What bears fail to tell everyone is a lot of AMZN product are from BABA. BABA sells in bulk on the cheap. People can talk down all they want about BABA, the people who take the time to research will be rewarded. Good day!"

"Your sources of news in US about China and other parts around world are very limited, a lot is fake news.. Whats going on with alibaba and others have nothing to do with Chinese government or so called ""commies"" being against free market economy and trying to destroy it.What China have been trying to do is finnaly take care of all fake listings on alibaba, fake feedbacks/reviews and fake companies with counterfeit products. Last year alone more then 1.7 trilion counterfeit and fake listing have been found on alibaba and taboa! Hundreds of thousands buyers lost their money...Try to do this here in US on eBay or Amazon.Mr. MA and others have been warned hundreds of times to address the issue, which they ignored for years.In the end it will be much safer and more transparent marketplaces for all across the world.Is that what investors want?"
I added some shares this morning after watching for weeks. I’ll check in in a couple years to see how they are doing.

"Simply buy the dip and hold:""Annual operating cash flow is at record highs, surpassing the $30 billion mark.Alibaba's cash and cash equivalents position is also at record highs, almost reaching $75 billion.However, Alibaba's share price is down by almost 50% since the peak reached in October 2020 due to China's regulatory crackdown.The cash position reflects around 17% of today's market cap. Annual cash flow from operations is set to continue to grow, eventually surpassing the $40 billion mark.Cash-rich Alibaba will get cash richer. Investors who buy Alibaba at current depressed valuations are likely to be rewarded handsomely."" SA"
I enjoy my weekends - no red charts for two days in a row.

this is atleast a $220 stock wayy oversold

Cathy is back in Chinese stocks. She just bought jd. Sold off some baba but I’m sure she will buy back again same with baidu. These celebrity CNBC type portfolio managers are flip floppers. I see China stocks going upFor a while
Look at the friggen balance sheet. This should be well over 300 once China concludes their crackdown on corruption. Yes people. China cracking down on corruption. They more “AmErican” than America’s big tech companies where they pushed for lockdowns so their stock prices can go up
ooooops..here comes 170's
"BABA's stock price is a classic example of Ben Graham's ""Mr. Market"" offering a great business at a discount price.""Everybody knows that the stock has a killer mix of growth and value, but the bear thesis is that China's regulatory crackdown will temper growth from here on out.It may well do so. BABA's $2.8 billion fine already took a bite out of earnings, and the CCP is not done with rolling out regulations. It could be that Chinese tech giants will have slower growth going forward than they would have had if Jack Ma hadn't opened his mouth.Nevertheless, the selloff we have observed has been irrational. BABA is not suddenly worth 27% less because it will face some regulatory pressure going forward. In fact, its stock price is a classic example of Ben Graham's ""Mr. Market"" offering a great business at a discount price. "" SA"
"Alibaba is in ""way oversold"" territory. (The RSI is at all time lows). Doesn't mean it can't keep falling but it means the likelihood decreases. For people suggesting the stock is going to zero or some other absurd number, this is merely nonsense. China is not disappearing. Is not looking for WWIII. Is not looking for a global financial war either. It is putting together a 5-year plan to take China into the coming decades. This includes revised rules and regulations.We may not like the plan or the power that the CPC has, but this doesn't mean the Chinese economy will tank. It is precisely the opposite. The CPC is DRIVEN for economic growth --- driven at a level few countries can understand.China wants to be #1 and will be #1 in about 5 years. And Alibaba, along with lots of other companies, will grow along side it. Within China and without.With all the negative news, how much focus is spent on Alibaba's growth outside of China?No joke here, Alibaba will not only recover but will grow beyond its October highs.Once the ""China Fear"" subsides, fundamentals will come back into play, and with topline growth over 30% year over year, BABA will not remain at these prices for long."
"Highlighting Warren Buffett StocksThe list below highlights Warren Buffett stocks like BABA stock, PayPal, Williams-Sonoma, Logitech and Cadence Design Systems that are in sync with his focus on management quality and long-term growth."
The global e-commerce market and Alibaba will continue to grow together. This is an opportunity to buy a fast growing e-commerce empire at an attractive price. This may be the best time to buy shares of Alibaba in a year.
"Hey all, long term investor here in bidu, baba, and just started a position in didi. I think they are all very undervalued compared to their US counterparts. Was curios on what everybody is thinking about George Soros comments? I mean I don’t think China wants to completely blow up their companies. I think they are simply addressing regulation. Just want some decent thoughts or perspectives?"

Shorts better make moves today or risk a big short squeeze loss.
Longs are already going thru their stack of Monday morning crying towels. HAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
No bad news all weekend?¿? Maybe because future’s are up !
"Huge overreaction and even bigger overselling. In terms of what’s China trying to do for its economic future, in the long term this is good news. China wants to make sure it’s citizens are protected from corporations abusing consumer data like US companies abuse the data they collect."
BABA closed in Hong Kong equivalent of $170.50..
"Today, AliCloud launches Dingding - first digital after-school service platform which connects education bureaus, schools, parents and students and third party education service institutions through DingTalk.. Another great news from BABA to revamp the education industry in China."

"Alibaba: A Coiled Spring""Alibaba's shares have collapsed over the last year, destroying hundreds of billions of dollars in equity value. This seems like an overblown reaction.There are risks, but that holds true for every stock. Chinese regulators will likely not try to end BABA's existence, as this wouldn't make any sense.BABA is very inexpensive, continues to grow, has a strong balance sheet, buys back its own shares, and the technical picture is not bad, either."" SA"
"Analysts holding steady on their one year forecasts while foreign investors holding firmly onto their panic and fear. Eventually everyone will be used to the new rules, delisting fears will dissipate, and price driving FOMO will return."
"Yesterday, Alibaba establishes new technology company with business scope including virtual reality equipment manufacturing, information system integration services, internet data services and information consulting services."
"The herd is overly pessimistic in regards to Chinese stocks. As usual, the drama will blow over. This will surge to $275 and begin giving you 20%+ annual return from there for at least the next 10 years.This is Amazon 5 years ago, the only difference is it is serving a market that is 5 times the size and growing every day. Back the truck up!!"
"Charlie was right, this is a wonderful investment"
On CNBC just now Brendan Ahern made an extremely compelling case to own BABA and other beaten down Chinese stocks at these prices.
This should be running at 170 if it track the same alibaba in hangseng. China investors are going to buy this up next day. Good news are coming along after today meeting. Buy now. We are heading to 200 for sure this time
at these levels maybe Amazon will buy baba
"If we gap up tomorrow, I thinks there's good chance we will fill the gap of $165.5-$172 tomorrow. Might also trigger small short squeeze. BABA made 10 point move today from $151 to $161 all the while being attacked by shorts. Good job I say."
"Alibaba: Mr. Market Serves Up A Bargain""Alibaba stock has been beaten down severely over the last several months, to the point where it trades at a rock bottom valuation.Despite this, the stock is still growing revenue and earnings at a fast pace.In the most recent quarter, Alibaba beat on EPS but missed on revenue.In this article, I will develop a bullish thesis on BABA arguing that the stock is a bargain at today's prices.""

"Alibaba opens global procurement festival to enable medium-sized enterprises go abroad digitally.According to data from Alibaba International Station, the average daily visit buyers, payment buyers, and online transaction volume of the platform from January to July increased by more than 60% year-on-year. This platform will help domestic small and medium-sized enterprises to seize the historical opportunities of cross-border B2B through a comprehensive upgrade of platform order flow, logistics and capital flow. Great Stuff! It is business as usual for BABA even with market noises."
"jd down 3, tencent down 1.7, baba even. Different"
"Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma once that it was difficult to root out fake goods on the company’s platforms because they were so high quality.“The problem is that the fake products today, they make better quality, better prices than the real products, the real names,”Let that sink for a minute and think about the value of this company ;)"
"Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, decreased to RMB20,683 million (US$3,203 million), from RMB36,570 million in the same quarter of 2020. The year-over-year decreases were mainly due to thepartial settlement in the amount of RMB9,114 million (US$1,412 million) of the RMB18,228 million Antimonopoly Fine and a decrease in profit as a result of our investments in key strategic areas. The partial settlement of 1.4B? Did they only pay half the fine so far?"
What does option expiration look like for this Friday.
Munger knows! Buy and hold!
One day soon this will have a $15.00-$20.00 up day. And you will wish you bought more in the 150-160's
Oh yes it happening again

Bought heavier today.. My average price is 165.. And bought more HK alibaba as well and average price is 153Am I doing it right?Anyone buying the dip?

This is still an amazing time to add to positions in 9988.HK or $BABA ! SoftBank are the reason for the prolonged weakness in Alibaba stock! They are reducing their positions which is totally understandable when you consider they paid $20million dollars for their massive stake! SoftBank are giving everyone a massive buying opportunity so snap it up before this ship starts to sail!

"I would like to point out the obvious, China is only haunting growth so they can take their portion of the pie. Anti monopoly laws.

That is what baba is they are the clear winner in the e-commerce sector and China wants some of the winnings! Think about it, China is not going after small companies with failing business models. No, they are going after the clear winners. BABA is a winner and this short term market correction will reverse faster than you shorts will have time to cover!"

China preparing for post covid. They know the economy will open up and grow. They are putting in place a more fair system so there is a more equitable rise. Also they are decreasing the potential of systemic risk as the economy grows. In addition they are trying to protect consumer data.

"Should have been up more today. The ccp gaming news was fud and when investors realized a version of this law has been around since 2019 and will have minimal impact. Shares recovered. A lot of these ccp regulations are common sense and similar to issues in western countries and good companies like baba adjust. China stocks will reflect fundamentals soon, but always at a discount because China does business differently, but do they? I the end companies want to make money"
who's buying this?
"Up 0ver 1% in HK 10M shares, even BIDU down there. C N B C Reporter from Hong Kong https://twitter.com/chengevelyn re-post an article {negative} from a few days Wednesday ago negative though like why!???!"
"Bloomberg has reached to bottom of desperation, how much short are they on Chinese stocks? 996 seriously"
Looking real solid. Hong Kong carries us through after hours then we might start seeing +7-20% gains in a single day. People just need to see confidence and stability because alibaba has an amazing balance sheet
When BABA BIDU start turning around you may see 20-25% in a hurry!
"Has anyone played with the Interval when you calc the DMA ... the chart appears to automatically toggle the intervals between the 50 DMA on say the 1 month versus the 2 year view, so the 50 DMA shows different when you compare the last month to 2 years ... any views on Interval setting? ... thankyou"
"Buy with a cash account. Avoid margin, and as tempting as it may be, stay away from call options, even LEAPS. Buy shares and hold, you have as long as you need to realize the gains."
Let me get this straight: the market was pricing in a reality where Chinese tech firms were under no obligation to maintain user privacy and is now outraged that they are now being forced to?

"Yall need to have a way longer timeframe. Even the people who are bullish on this stock are only talking about the next months or the next 1-2 years. Guys, its impossible to know what the market will do. All I know is that Alibaba is a great business and if it keeps growing the fundamentals will come through in the end"
"10,000 at 164.oo. ave, hope to retire nicely in 2 years at least"
BABA keeps on dipping and it is a good time to pick it up tbh. Very cheap.BULLISH https://marketdeepview.com/2021/08/30/alibaba-baba-stock-continues-to-be-trading-at-a-discount/
We should give Baba 6-7 months like a patient value investors and this will be back to 250-270 range.
"On the algorithm rules, Alibaba $BABA Taobao already allows you to see which ad-related tags the platform gives you and remove them for 6 months at a time. The tags are personalized and quite extensive. I really doubt people adjust it that much? How many of you adjust your Facebook ad options?Finally, you can turn off all personalized recommendations in Taobao (or other Chinese e-commerce apps). That was required by law since 2019 as I mentioned earlier."
"Data privacy protection law already exists in Europe and U.S. But when it comes out of CCP, it warrants all Chinese stocks to be halved. Monopoly did existed in China, in fact BABA was very much like Monopoly as you can say Amazon is very much like Monopoly with pricing power as is MSFT with its Windows operating system. Truth is everything got magnified x 10, just because it came out of CCP, communist country. That does not mean SP gets to cut in half. Everyday that goes by people are going to loose this dramatic effect and see the STOCK for its value, growth, asset, EPS power...then hands down BABA is it. BABA more than twice of sales, faster growth, higher profit margin, higher EPS that of AMAZON yet it is 1/4th of AMZN's market cap. Let that sink in."
"+780 shares at 156, my portfolio is finally 100% Baba."
Solid volume on the positive price movement as well
"It is just a start, is going to rise UP fast coming, Buy BABA asap and Hold !"
"The mystery is in the volume. Our big reversal day had nearly 90m volume, more than 400% average volume, while other china tech did about 200%. We were outperforming china tech up until the massive sell off. Yes baba is more popular amongst retail, but the extra volume came from someone big unloading imo, likely some forced liquidation. If this was Softbank or an insider, right now we are dealing with millions of extra shares that have not been available to trade in years, if ever. Funds will accumulate with time. Its the only thing that makes sense with the insane volume, and the sudden underperformance"
Whoop there it is
200 on 17th Sep. Mark my words.
"There appears to be a malfunction on the price feed, showing $BABA up 1%."
I am buying Chinse BABA JKS DQ since JD reported excellent earnings yesterday!
"Manipulated down to this level. This stock will eventually be $300+. Might take a year or 2, but it is certainly being manipulated lower, so buyers can get in. Enjoy the discount."
So Cathy woods says China is investable. She doesn’t have vie concerns. Now it comes down to fundamentals. She picked her winner JD based on her etf theme of logistics. This doesn’t mean baba is bad. Baba is a cash generating machine it will return
