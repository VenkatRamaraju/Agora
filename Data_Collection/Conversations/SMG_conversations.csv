Is anyone willing to shed some light on whether Hawthorne investing into Canopy’s diverged Rivers (CNPOF) is legitimate?
"Way, way oversold!!!!"
"While I occasionally find a nugget of decent investing info on Y.F. message boards, the primary reason I visit boards is for entertainment and to pass the down times at work sitting on a trading desk. Some posters are a font of entertainment! And some posters have no sense of humor (and don't like being called out) And some can handle the travails of the market better than others.While SMG may be down for the year, the value of my portfolio is significantly higher; how can that be?Some don't realize there is more than one way to skin a cat; some try to scalp a few bucks and others invest for the long haul. Me? I've owned a few positions for DECADES (yes plural). Time is a trader's nemesis while it's an investor's ally. Life is full of experiences. Experiences may lead to wisdom.Oh yeah, what was THE stock in my real life story I posted a couple weeks or so ago?SBAC (Yes! I've been long GREATER amounts in both AMT and CCI for the same time, but of course, I have taken some off the table in each...WINNING!)"
No news and its down $7? Must have been a downgrade
Huge Dow Down Daybut it didn't effect SMG a bit with large amounts of investments after Zacks and Motely Fool show BUY recommendations.
"Got in at $153.23, price tarket $180"
"My dividend was reinvested two days ago @155.27.Earlier today, I added one more like amount; this time @153.53.Am I ""lying""?Why would anyone post lies?As long as one is comfortable in their own skin, there really is no need to lie. Yes, I'm very comfortable in both my skin and my investment holdings (plural).In other words, no, I didn't ""lie"" when I wrote about my 20+ year holding of SBAC (and also AMT and CCI--I've got others as well). Why a particular poster can't comprehend this as being true is...well, I can only assume it is envious? Sure! I've had a few stocks that blew up, but I've done just fine overall.The returns on my individual equities haven't varied much from VTI's and thus 66% my equity exposure is in VTI or the like. I own a few other funds and about 21% is held in individual stocks of which SMG is just one. I expect SMG to perform well, over the LONG term. I don't really care much about the noise from point A to point B (See my experience with SBAC lol). I can handle the volatility. SMG shares have been no stranger to volatility. I've only been long SMG for 4.3 years and my position has experienced some decent volatility! Heck, when shares dipped December 2018, I was down 36% or just a bit less than the current 39% dip from SMG's all time high. Wealth isn't made in a few weeks, but over years, decades. There's more than one way to skin a cat.Cheers to SMG investors."
This stock looks like it could use some Miracle-gro....
Why is this stock down so much? Thanks!
2x volume selling! great.
Check out my analysis on $SMG:https://ericthomson.substack.com/p/the-scotts-miracle-gro-company-smg?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=
Stock has stopped going down. Of course the Dow was up 900. That doesn’t hurt.

Wow still under 148 with Dow up every day
"Just a few trading days left until October options expire!Options provide leverage, but they often have a short shelf life.Buying an out of the money option provides more leverage than an in the money option and the cost per option is less. What happens to an in the money option that is now out of the money? For example, on September 7, SMG traded 156.01 - 159.35 and the SMG 155 OCT calls were trading with a ""7"" handle whereas now they're bid just 0.20. Will shares of SMG hit 155+ before Friday's close?Since I'm not a trader, I'm not that bothered by short term price movements, as the market once in a while may be mispricing shares. Yup! Time is an investor's friend, but the enemy of those who speculate in short term options--regardless if the option purchased was in the money or out of the money. An option that expires worthless is a 100% loss.Check back Friday?"
Just the beginning
8 day sma thru 21 now. Waiting for break above 153 on volume to confirm it is time to enter.
Considering a position here. Any input will help me. What drove the price to the 250's?
Imagine if wooglin had sold all his stock at 250 or 220 and tried some calls around 195 and again around 175 and again around 150.Well he would still have hundreds of thousands more than he now has. LolSure stock is better than calls if the stock is going sideways or up slowly.Calls are much better at minimizing loses when. The stock drops 110
Flood of competition against Hawthorne in MJ space. Cause there is a ton now
"Wooglin has no logic. All things being equal better to buy a call and lose the entire 2.00 than have the equal number of shares and stock go down 10, 20, 50 and yes 110 a share.Wooglin would say yeah but I own the stock. Well I can buy the stock too and do so on,y losing 2.00 on the calls so I have more left to buy the stock with"
Did we bottom yet?
I got in at 147. Hoping the earnings call doesnt have neg surprises
"Hey!!!Now that the Oct 155 calls have expires worthlessly, it's time for the share price to go up!"
Forward PE of 17.5x's------it still isn't cheap. I suspect that Wallstreet does not like the company entering into cannabis and making deals for expansion into Russia. Sold today with an 18% loss---bye bye
"Well today was fun!Days like this are easier to handle if one were raised before the era of everyone gets a trophy (or a ""goody bag"" at someone else's birthday party).It is important to remember: ""Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!""That said, what a curious move today.Have a nice evening."
"Assuming the earnings report doesn't have any surprise bad news, this stock should finally start its reversal as it seems to have finally hit an inflection point"
"More flight to quality or a ""Barron's Bounce""?I have wondered if SMG would separate Hawthorne...From the Barron's piece:""“Scotts has a fantastic consumer franchise,” says Jon Boyar, a principal at Boyar Value Group, which holds the stock. “At the current stock price, you’re effectively getting the hydroponics business for free.” He values the two businesses at more than $200 a share.A split of the businesses would probably boost the stock, but the company has said it isn’t interested in such a move now. “It could get to the point where strategically it makes more sense,” says Jim King, head of public and investor relations at Scotts.""Oh yeah, I realize TONE doesn't always translate well in just words. It's clear at least one poster is all business and has no sense of humor nor can it discern humor even when there's a DISCLAIMER!) Perhaps had I included ""apologies to Roseanne Roseannadanna"" it would have understood the inclusion of ""nevermind"". ""(What's that? Volume is less than the normal modest level? Never mind!)""Speaking of volume, it is disappointing that volume is so low today.In conclusion, ""Sit back and relax; enjoy the show!""or, if you prefer:""Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!""Cheers."
"Jabber—- you must be short smg and like to see money leave your accounts!! Otherwise, why is every post negative?"
"SMG is on my watchlist for entry. Been waiting for awhile. Still waiting for a break out of this downward channel and a successful retest of that level; however lower or higher that may be. Waiting for that technical keeps from getting in mid-decline. 140 is support, and then 115ish. It may not get there, but then, I didn't think it would get to 150. I love rules for entry and tight stops on initial entries. GLTA"
"I've seen this more and more stocks just drop and don't give you one clue why. I bought this at $80, I could sell still with a profit, but you know the old rule, don't sell low"
Clearly there's a flight to quality names and SMG is a beneficiary.(What's that? Volume is less than the normal modest level? Never mind!)
OK. Averaging back in from here. Looks like the bounce is ready. Just make it BIG!
This is still overvalued. I see 87-90 as next support.
Bought some at $146.80
"Wooglin. First I didn’t buy any options on SMG until 195. Then around 175. Let’s say I had bought 5 contracts at 195 for 2.00 a contract, that’s 1000.00 stock goes to 175.00. I lost 1000.00You on the other hand buy 500 shares and stock goes to 175.Who lost more? I lost 1000 while you lost 5000. Period. Doesn’t matter if you own the stock or are so called long term. Doesn’t matter, you lost 5000. Period. Now at 175.00 I try again and the stock goes to 155 which it did. I lost another 1000 and you lost another 5000. So now I’m down 2000 and you are down 10,000But it’s worse than that for you, I’m sure you have more than 500 shares,At least that how you talk and project. I bet you own 5000 shares,"
"What did I say, you will never see 244 again, hacks."
You have problems lol
"SMG showing good relative strength on down days for the market with some longer green volume days and a rounding of the downward channel, but still in it unless using very short time frame which I dont. It is a benefactor of rotation going on underneath a weak general tape. Still waiting for technical breakout. Feeling a little fomo here, but will wait for successful retest and bounce off 140, 8 ema through 21 day, or break of 150-160 with volume to enter fractionally."
"The poor saps that bought this at 244, they will never see that again."
