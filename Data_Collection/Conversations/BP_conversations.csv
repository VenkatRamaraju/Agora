Oil price over $45 and BP makes profit. BP is just getting richer and richer. Low share price is great for buy backs and dividends for long term investors. This is probably the floor. I would buy now before you lose this opportunity
"Reported: bp repurchased 111,639,620.00 ordinary shares in London in August ending 8/26/21"
"BP forecast for Q3: The London-based energy company said it expects higher upstream production than in April-June, higher product demand across its customer business, and slightly improved refining margins."
Jeff Currie at Goldman wrong on oil and on copper.

Beautiful day :)
"I have owned by since 16 dollars and added along the way, it is stable and pays a dividend which helps. I truest believe a correction is near and a housing bubble crash is highly likely when interest rates start to hike a ARM loans payment spike along with rental evictions in high numbers likely within months. BP is a great stick to hold against inflation and DRV is a short against the housing market. Even in high markets great opportunities do exist to make money! Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy. At today’s market highs it’s greed so it’s time to be fearful! A quote from Warren Buffet!"
They need to stop share repurchase and increase dividend. That is the only way to increase stock in any meaningful way. Share repurchase is just a cloak on how many shares they issues to the undeserving BoD and Looney.
I’m a BPMP owner. Facing buyout and conversion to BP shares. Has BP done a stock split or is it really trading at the same price as it was in 1995?
"what is up with the exagerated price targets and continual falling share prices, there appears to be no bottom, what is the catalyst to turn this sector positive? We keep seeing maintain and even upgrades in the sector with falling prices a result????????????"
Saw the Saudi Minister of Energy on Bloomberg this morning before the OPEC+ meeting and he was hellbent not to allow the UAE to increase their oil production above what was previously set. Apparently today’s meeting went nowhere and the meeting was “postponed” to a later date with no increase oil output. Let’s see what oil at $90 does to the stock market.https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/OPEC-Fails-To-Hike-Oil-Production-Delays-Decision-Again.html
Oil supply stopped due to major hurricane...higher gas prices equals $30 BP.
"Brent crude back above $69. That was quick. Fundamentals will win out in the end. Unlike many on this site, I also believe BP has one of the best CEO's in the business. I'm looking forward to the Q2 earnings release."
"BP will pop.......46, asleep at the wheel."

Buy BP and stick it in a drawer. It's a bargain.
Screaming buy on so many levels
Anyone read the Barron's news on BP buying and doubling their position in XOM shares? My questions why?
"buybacks are waste of time, we dont see anything from it, give our full dividend back"
"Reported: bp repurchased 104,514,620 ordinary shares in London in August ending 8/24/21 or.0052 of total outstanding shares."
"The analysis says that the second quarter projected earnings are between $0.45 - $0.85/share. Could this be a little on the short side? For the second quarter it appears that the average price/barrel is around $69. If the company is selling 225 million barrels/quarter and if the breakeven is $45/barrel with 3.4 billion shares this alone provide around $1.60/share and if the breakeven was $40/barrel it would be $1.92/share. This I suspect wouldn't include natural gas sales, convenience store profits, futures trading, or selling used tires to the disabled and etc. I hope I'm wrong because I'm really dumb (borderline stupid) and I'm sure that those who do the analysis should be correct. After all they are really smart (borderline genius)? I wouldn't want to make anybody feel bad. If I'm right however then perhaps here comes the dividend increase?"
The OPEC+ deal is good news for oil cos. It provides stability to the mkt and removes uncertainty. I predict the short-term sell-off in oil prices will quickly reverse. I also believe the inpact of the covid 'delta' variant has been overstated. Not a single nation is re-imposing lockdowns. The sell-off in oil shares has been vastly overdone.
"At some point when the MMs and whales are finished stealing shares, oil stocks have to trade closer to reasonable valuations. For kicks, I calculated 2021 & 2022 combined average PE ratios (based on Non- GAAP quarterly EPS consensus estimates in my Merrill Edge trading platform with today's prices) for the O & G stocks I own. $CPE : 2.93 (quarterly projections probably don't include recent acquisition) $LPI : 2.29$BCEI : 5 (also pays dividend)$BP : 7.95 (also pays dividend)$SBOW : 1.96$WTI : 4.29Good luck longs. And shorts, I've been enjoying your meaningless price targets that you post like every 10 minutes on these boards that include no data to back them up whatsoever. Enjoyable comedy!"
"The last time Oil was $70 and Henry Hub natural Gas was $4, BP was $46 so why is BP only $23?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9434BoGkNQ"
$27.50 today. $40.00 by years end.
"With the upcoming results what an amazing opportunity to either buy in for a quick 10-15% return, or to hold on for a super yield which will just grow over the couple of years. I, like many, have held pre-pandemic so have suffered over the past 18 months, but he current value is undeniable"
If the share price doesn’t jump 10% minimum after earnings then something is rotten in the market !
With Grandpa Joe cutting US future oil production BP looks solid going forward.
BP will add another $900 billion to its share repurchase for a total of $1.4 billion from 1st half 2021 surplus cash flow.
"Here's more evidence that demand for oil continues to increase. The following stats are from the EIA: Overall petroleum demand increased 7% week/week, EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report showed. Over the past four weeks, motor gasoline product consumption averaged 9.4 million b/d, up 10%, and distillate fuel consumption averaged 3.8 million b/d, also ahead 10%. Jet fuel demand soared 50% to 1.4 million b/d, reflecting a rebound in travel as global economies reopen amid coronavirus vaccination efforts."

Hmm these buybacks seems to have zero effect. This company must be one of the most hated among retail investors. Despite great financial result people are just dumping their shares. Doesn’t matter if oil goes up or down…
FANG increased their DIV by 12.5% yesterday. BP just 4%. BP BOD need to all be fired. Clean House.

ALL OIL STOCKS ARE MANIPULATED SINCE COVID STARTED. SINCE COVID STARTED INVESTORS DID NOT RECEIVE ANY DIVIDEND OR ANY GAIN
Most oil countries need oil 65-75 to pay the bills for their whole countries...raising production could lower gas prices 30 cents here and yet cripple whol economies elsewhere.....and we also told those same economies that our goal is to cut out oil eventually
But Gilman Sachs put a $36 price target  on it a few months back    
Huge share buyback. Increased dividend. Reduced debt. Increased production guidance. Great future projections including annual dividend increases and share buybacks based on $60.00 a barrel.

Is all they have to do is convert 2 dozen gas stations to EV charging and Hydrogen. .Instant Green leadership. the stock doubles. .
Brent oil price $68.71 afterhours.
A big part of Bps business is nat gas....today almost at 5 years high and Europe is getting strained for LNG due to demand
Great results and even better guidance. Will continuously head north for next couple months. Only downside is the Delta variant.
bp makes too much money.Forward PE ratio should drop to mid single digitsassuming current stock price and Brent crude oil pricetrades sideways and bp stays within theircapital expenditure guidance.
"16,000,000,000 ft.³ added to storage all energy Companies both oil and natural gas or very undervalued I have a funny feeling by January 1 they will all be double and triple the price of what they are now"
"I added few more shares today. Hope to build my way up to 10k shares. BP is still 90% ++ oil company. Plastic, lubricants, ICE are not going anywhere in a hurry. This stock is undervalued because current market trends are not interested in fundamentals. BP paying down debt is great, wish the US gov learned a lesson there."
At 70.00+ oil hard to understand this as a 25.00 stock with a 5% dividend. You know they're making tons at 70.00 oil and I don't care how many windmills or solar panels they own. I will buy more but waiting for a bottom on this if there is one. Already cut myself trying to catch a falling knife lol. Saving dry powder for the bottom. For BP the bottom could be pretty low. Why? Who knows. If you do inform me lol.
"How do we trade nearly twice the daily average over 24 million shares and the stock moves a couple of pennies? Oil up almost 2 percent and it moves up a couple of pennies. When oil is down 2 percent the stock falls 4 percent? I am starting to believe the conspiracy theory, BP is driving it’s share down intentionally to buy them back at huge discounts!"
BP was 27 back in march when things terrible still way cheap folks
Goldman has a $41 price target
"$500 million share buyback.....Was that supposed to make BP stock go up? Stock is @ $25 with oil at $75 and Nat gas above $3.50. Been a long time shareholder bought some more yesterday....and today oil is up, yet BP trading down.Mr. Looney and Mr Auchincloss need to get better at story telling because it doesn't seem like Wall Street is believing what they are doing. I hope 2nd quarter earnings and conference call go well, to get this stock to $30! Stock should be at $35!!! That was a cheap price for BP a few years ago! Lets go!!"
There went entire gain from outstanding Quarter total BS buying more
Great earnings. Validates all the analysts upping their PT.
"BP shoul;d be at $33 a share, not $25! BOD have destoyed the once proud company."
Will cross 30 shortly

"Everybody wants in before the X-Dividend Thursday. Question is how will price react post X-Div? Looks like the funds are repositioning one more time before the run up, oil is just before gapping up IMO, has been a steady climb for last 3 weeks, hope it holds."
"Another amazing stat: Despite today's 7.3% sell-off, the price of oil (WTI) is up 64% over the past year. During the same period, BP's share price is down. It was trading @ $24.09 on July 21, 2020. Incredible."
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019.

"as usual, bp is falling behind"
"Oil up 5.5% approx , BP up 2.5%, fairly typical lack lustre performance."
Now panic selling. Volume of almost one million shares in just one hour of pre-market trading. BP at $23.10 -- down 19% from last month.
If BP can't make a boodle of money with Brent over 70.00 per barrel. They better go back Economics 101.
"In Q2, BP rec'd a massive dividend of $689 MILLION from its 20% stake in Rosneft. This compares to $328 million in Q1 -- an increase of 110%!"
Very good action today
Tide is turning
Powell and his cronies.. are buying more Treasuries and MBS nowthan during the financial crisis... The economy is soring and the interest rates are at zero... What is the US going to do when things do get bad... I'd say all the dry powder has been used. Powell Worst Fed Chairman in history Ho
"Buybacks do nothing to the share price. BP again screwed SHs with their measly dividend increase. They NEVER should have cut the dividend by 50%. Thats the bottom line. Give it all back to us, like the other majors."
nasdaq and dow about to head to correction as cases are increasing...
calm down Henry lol
Can we expect a large spike Monday with IDA in play?
"Yeah, as all the Socially Responsible Funds can't touch Oil&Gas, I think BP will just increase their yield and do a buyback, just seems like a no-brainer. As so much of the Execs comp is tied to Stock, why not just play the game to increase their $. The value will always be capped to some degree, but no reason we couldn't see the 30's by as early as next year."
"BP is probably one of the most unloved stocks in an unloved sector. When it finally becomes obvious to investors that fossil fuel will remain dominant for another 30 years at the very least, and that trillions of dollars in profits will be made selling fossil fuel and it's vast array of by-products, then the sector may reach a fair valuation level.."
Fantastic opportunity to add more shares today. Oil will continue to climb while BP continues to look cheaper and cheaper as profits will accelerate.
bp was trading at this level when crude was over 22$ a barrel less and nat gas was in the low 2s rough math would say that they are earning about 7-10 billion more per year at these levels ....they alost paid down 10 billion of debt a year ahead of time.....
Nat gas going through the roof....between crude and nat gas ..they will pay their whole debt load in 18 months at this rate...covid is holding all oil down...with a 6 pe or less this should be at least a 12 pe or about 32-38 per share
It will be on 30s after earnings
From their dtga book each 1$ brent move 340 million ...they show 7$ move this pat quarter so about 2.4 billion more than last quarter ....nat gas was flat for q 2...refining margins appear to have moved 5 points and they show 450 million per point so another 2.25 billion over last quarter ..so it appears from their site data they could show another 4.75 billion more free cash flow over last quarter ...putting it close to 10 BILLION in one quarter..the wild card is the trading desk....could add or take away some ...if this proves out these numbers are staggering...q3 refing margins and q2 crude and nat gas prices are on their site ...
BP will have some great earnings coming up soon. Wonder if that will wake a few people up.......or......will they be sticking with the overpriced eternal money losers with P/Es in the negatives or in the thousands at best? We will soon know.
Bears going to lose this one :)
To give you an idea of the size of BP's huge Q2 net dividend rec'd from Rosneft. It was enough to pay for BP's entire $500 million share repurchase + $189 million to spare!
BP should be pushing 40
"The gutless, socialist CEO wont even comment on the depressed stock price. He shouldnt be leading an oil company, period!"

EVERCORE new target 31...HOLD....Interesting give the guy a calculator ..the stock is 25 ...thats a 25% move ...they upgrade tec shtocks 50$ which somtimes is 2% ....it % gains not dollar upgrades ..consensus about 34
bp buybacks are material. Plan buybacks every quarter up to a price limit which meansif the stock price increases substantially it's likely the buybackmoney will go into the cash dividend.
"Its all about the narrative, not earnings or the price of oil. What is this company about? An oil company, a ""green"" energy company, etc. No one knows. The CEO/Board have done a horrible job communicating the story. They have done a horrible job adding to shareholder value."
the deal was reached by opec. prices will be supported. even if oil goes to 60 this stock must go to low 30's. this price is a bargain...

Recent article says BP bought shares of XOM. Obviously they prefer XOM shares to BP.

"Buy Backs are in full swing. 32,455,608 shares bought on the 4th and 5th. Got this off their website. If my calculations are good That is just under 1% of their outstanding shares (3.37B). This should definitely strengthen the share price and give more opportunity for them to raise dividend. Although lets be honest, they probably will only do a marginal increase next time like they did this time. Regardless, definitely giving this stock a reason to move toward 30$."
I'll take the 6% dividend while stock goes back up over 40 get in on the cheap now in my opinion

Be happy to buy it on sale! We all agree this should be at $30. And I'm sure it will be... Do you want to buy at $30 or $25? I like $25!"
Own enough bp but had to buy more on dip.
"BP share price has been down sharply, but all energy co.'s have been hit the past few weeks. The stock market is apparently pricing in another wave of the pandemic with a corresponding negative effect on the world economy. The big difference with the current wave is the case #'s are much lower as is the rate of hospitalizations/deaths, esp. in countries with greater % of vaccination. Barring a big increase in deaths or ineffectiveness of vaccines, I seriously doubt that gov'ts will reimpose lockdowns. In fact, the recent increase in cases (""delta"" variant) will have the end result of increasing societal immunity. BP is a very good buy at the current price (but could get cheaper)."
Cheap
I see that BP wants to buy back stock. What does it mean when a company buys back their stock?

"OIL up, BP down; Oil down, BP down. Market up, BP down; Market down, BP down. Weird! Properly it has an intrinsic issue?"
"Well, well, well. Two days ago the sky was falling because covid cases were spiking. The cases are still spiking (supposedly) but, the panic sellers are now panic buyers."
M/A or a direct purchase of BP will happen if the share price remains in the current range. It is just tremendously undervalued.
The constant downward pressure on BP share price seems relentless.Doesnt really matter what price oil. Something just not right.
Reported: bp repurchased 82.9 million shares in London in August ending 8/18/21 (today).
Reported: Iraq approves BP plan to spin off giant Rumaila oilfieldinto a separate company jointly owned by bp and CNPC.
what's the new dividend yield?
"BP strategy: cut dividend and devalue the stock . . . Perform share buybacks at the discounted rate . . . Slowly increase dividend while investing in green . . . This stock will be undervalued for a while yet, management do not want a high share price"
I believe BP is over sold the whole idea is to buy low and sell high. If you wait to buy a stock when it recovers you could miss the rally. I am long BP and am buying on the dip.
Mergers will be happening at these prices. Allreadybhaooening dor smaller producers. The longer the stock stays depreciated the more enticing it becomes. Paying a premium becomes less than fair value at these prices
It's a gift. Load up
Flights are packed. Gas stations are packed. They are minimizing debt. BP will increase profits over this next year.
BP doing a great job. Just need to focus on improving ROI/Profit.
I can't get over the fact that BP share price was higher than this in 1996! think about that
"BP stock is trading as if oil were selling for $20/BBL and never go up. Heck, its selling for $70/BBL for crying out loud!"
"bravo!, glad I keep most my BP....they finally use the cash in a better place instead of buying a wind farm"
Welcome back all the dividend chasers. And thank you for letting us have your shares for cheap over the last couple of months.
BPs problem. You can’t be an environmentally friendly company and an oil company at the same time. You can’t be a renewable energy company without significant funding to build out infrastructure. BPs solution: Use oil revenue to create a renewable branch of the company large enough to stand on its own. Then split the oil side and the renewable side while simultaneously doing a semi ipo on the renewable side to provide funding for continuing renewable projects. The new renewable company would attract the green growth investors while the bp oil company could increase investor return as they no longer have the renewable capex costs.
I would dearly love for BP to get back to its January 2020 trading range. Looney has unequivocally destroyed shareholder value in the near term.
"In opening trades on London exchange, BP share price is up 2.5%. Let's see if it lasts."
"BP expects to be able to continue increasing its dividend by about 4% annually and repurchase $1 billion of shares each quarter until 2025, Looney said.That would lift total shareholder returns to about 10%, at the top end of its peer group, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. BP shares now up 3% on London Exchange."
Oil staying above 65 should mean bp hitting 30 sometime this year or next
"I'll call this a win. It is showing they are going to return $ and make sure investors can get high returns, even if all the Environmental funds can't touch them. And every other mutual fund that doesn't have to avoid O&G will invest in them, and help drive the price up. I used to work in energy (more utility thought), and all I can say is people are going to need Oil & Gas, and Utility energy for a lot longer than they think. Even most of this electric car stuff is green-washing. All the MFGs can covert to OEM electric in the next 5 years, but the grid (and power generation capacity) is not ready to move that fast."
Mon bp!!
"Gutless CEO Looney wont even talk about share price. He'll spend all his time about clean energy, green energy, etc., but in terms of supporting shareholders directly through dividend increases or significant buybacks because the shares are cheap, not a word...Oil over $70 and this stock is still about 40% below its ""baseline"" pre-pandemic."
Funny. I bounce all over the boards posting comments etc. this is one position that I do nkt with a few others. I know what I have here.  4000 shares strong
Not sure what to think on this one?
Yes pIper upgrade to 37 today...SO TELL ME where in tech could you possobly make 60% ..theya re going to have about 20 billion in free cash flow and nat gas is way up the biggest part of their production...THEY HIOT THEIR DEBT TARGET A YEAR AHEAD OF TIME ;LAST QUARTER
Couldn’t help grabbing 200 call contracts strike $25 that expire Sep/17 for cost $1.13 premium 
Will BP beat or fall short of Q2 2021 earnings estimates and any increase in the dividend rate?
The trend is for weekly WTI oil inventory drawdown to continue.
"BP hasn’t been in a better position since it was at $21/ADR. With Brent well above $70 it has been racking in the cash. Even in July, the historically low month, the price has held. It may not hit $40 this year, but will break $35 buy October!"
Per report: 90% of U.K. adults received one dose of vaccine.Around 66% of UK adults received two doses of vaccine.
5.4 BILLION in one quarter of free cash flow..lowered net debt raised dividend massive stock buyback and the kicker they can do most of the above at 60$ oil ...as stated some oil majors have pes of 15 or more ..Bp with the beat has a foward pe of about 7 or less
BP stock getting crushed again on near $80 oil...not a peep from gutless Looney on the depressed share price.
When can BP hit $30?

Transportation Security Administration throughput data showed that 2,227,704 travelers went through TSA checkpoints on Sunday, the most since Feb. 28, 2020, which was more than a week before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. And the three-day total of 6,407,500 travelers, from Friday through Sunday, was the most since the three-day stretch ended Feb. 28, 2020."
Long term plan seems pretty clear. Invest enough capital in renewables that they are able to become stand alone spin off with returns that support further capex renewable projects. This spin off will be separate from bp so that green governments and institutions can morally invest in them. Valuation will be comparable to other renewable growth companies. Maintain oil production as well as the stake in Rosneft as oil prices remain high bc of developing countries ever increasing demand. We get the best of both worlds.
"With BP spinning off the Iraq assets, what do BP stock holders get from this transaction? This is a valuable asset and I don’t see where anything of value is being exchanged. I will be voting against Looney and the board at the next stockholder meeting."

What percentage of BP’s revenue comes from Natural Gas?
bp is the cheapest major oil company. but the problem remains mangement is just too focussed on the short term. i dont get why they just up working capital+ invest in their already existing assets to prevent spills.at this point its just waiting before someone else does it. shell already wanted to buy bp once and maybe chevron is going to try and merge with them beacuse bp just has way more operations then chevron.

Alot of desparate folks trying to WISH this dog to to go up..Buy a lottery ticket instead.
"BP's treasury is getting a complete gift here being able to buy back shares at this price with Brent at $70 bbl. The market is just insane.

BP share price now UP 5.1%. Very positive market reaction to earnings report and conference call with BP execs.
August and September are never good for the stock market.
My thought are this..much larger stakeholders who ahve hnudreds of millions if not billions invested here see the earnings potential and have yet to see the upside..these players will be riding them to unlock or create value ...THIS SHOULD BE AT LEAST 50% HIGHER RIGHT NOW...sit tight things will start to happen..the move from the teens was far less impressive then their peers so it looks like they still ahve the most % upside
"As I've said before, BP should have never cut the dividend. With RDS, they are the only oil companies to do so. If they are serious about maintaining their shareholder base, they should start restoring the dividend. Also maintain enough cash on hand to survive the next downturn in oil prices. This is not rocket science."
Bp will buy back 1 billion per qrtr. At $25 per share thats 40 million shares a qrtr - 160 million per year. 4.7% of the float bought back annually. That alone reduces dividend cost to company and increases eps.
"Is it me, or is the DIV increase a total joke?"
"Good earnings, nice dividend, 30s coming at some point imo"
I have full confidence in BP and their strategy.
"Market Cap vs Revenue #EGY = 1.76x#XOM = 1.12x#BP = .44x#PSX = .39xRelatively speaking, EGY is holding its own in comparison to the majors. Thankful for EGY and GLTA!"

"At the current share price, BP should use its excess cash to repurchase stock. In the long run, that will save billions in dividend pymts. It will also increase EPS. The current dividend is sufficient until stock price moves higher."
figured on good report this was outstanding report I see BP going a lot higher now 4% dividend increase love itshare buyback could not ask for better stock was way low to begin with lower than what a year ago with gas and oil half what they are now.. nope think BP should be in 30 range
I bought some insanely cheap / risky options with huge upside. September’s. Call’s. Waiting on the earnings report for a couple dollar move. Options should bump 40-60%.
BP announced that the BP CEO is going to hold a meeting in September to lay out the plan for the company going forward. As fast as the stock has been dropping I can’t figure out why investors need to wait until September to hear this great plan?
The beautiful thing about BP is that it has made itself investibke for green funds
"Oil companies have done nothing when smashing earnings this QTR, not expecting much with BP"
Forgot to mention that most oil companies do pay a decent dividend. But I just don't see any price appreciation.
"Xom cvx hess conoco etc etc...all have pes of 15-22....7 here .....no reasona ny longer...they lowered net debt under analyst desired target range in record time...they have an above average dividend for the industry,,,tons of cash on hand ...massive buyback...public acceptance as they migrate carefully to renewables ....and they build a forward model based on 60$ oil.....this should be 35-40 and it would only have a pe of about 13-14"
"I’m describing this as a stubborn ox. It’s just won’t move, but when it does, there will be no stopping it!"
"Brent crude back above $74 ($74.20) -- up $6 since Mon. -- yet BP stock languishing at $23.50. Not even a 5.4% dividend is attracting buyers. They'd rather pay absurd valuations for tech stocks (Shopify @ $1,654; PE = 400) with zero dividend."
"Well, I sold 15,000 BP shares this morning into the good news euphoria. That represented 85% of my BP holdings. 3000 shares are a legacy holding from my Dad, and those I’ll hold as long as I live, or at least as long as BP is not bought up/out, as a nostalgia tribute to him. We will see if the share price holds, continues to rise, or drops due to further negative Delta variant related news before ex-dividend next week. That will determine whether I get back in to scoop up the Dividend again or not. Good luck to all."
When do they report earnings?
The most under valued oil major.
xom and cvx has about a 14-15 pe...bp is looking like 6-7
"You can take advantage of the stupidity of the average investor by picking up oil stocks now. BP and COP are two of your large, safe ones. Anyone believing the wind/solar hype needs to understand they could double next year and it would barely dent oil and gas consumption. It will take a decade for them to double. All US wind/solar could be replaced by 2 nuclear plants, it's so insignificant (and probably should be). Oil and gas are the king and queen of energy and will be for the lifetime of everyone alive today."
No one is paying attention to Natural gas. price has doubled since 1Q. BP should have a blow out tomorrow. However stock price will be held hostage until the get the Divi back up.
VTNR is another oil refinery stock. Earnings in 10th august.
Chevron appears to have a pe of about 17-20 for the year ahead...while BP is about 8 based on forwward earnings and thats before any beats ..Bp appear to have muc more % upside potential
"In April of 2019 Oil was 72$ a barrel while BP was £ 5.60 per share. Today with oil at $74/75 a barrel BP is at £3.07. That's almost a 50% difference, something not quiet right here."
Reported: bp repurchased 75.79 million shares in London in August ending 8/17/21.
BP should be trading at like 32 right now way cheap enough said looking for takeover bid this cheap
Nothing will happen til dividends are back.
Yes Bp has massive Gas sales ..more than oil
"Still down 5% on a month ago . . . . Was life that good a month ago? . . . I hope the buybacks generate a higher share price, it’s been a grim 18 months to hold BP."
Oil is at a 6 year high while BP stock isn't
it's been a good day. back in da green
Good luck everyone.No reason to watch paint dry orread this thread.No reason to repeat myself.Looney won't change.Investors won't change.BOD should have been removed.Oil & gas are better investments than green energy.
"I notice that share prices of oil cos like French Total have not dropped nearly as sharply as BP, and the reason is obvious. Total did not cut its dividend. Currently pays 7.3%. Stock was down 1.5% today vs. 3.2% for BP."
"Democrats Propose Big Oil Polluters’ Fund, how much is china and india gonna pay in, and why no mention of the biggest polluters that is coal?"

"I think all these O&G are oversold, but at some point investment houses are going to see the yield alone is too strong to resist. Right now we are very unpopular - while we power the world, everyone wants to make it like we're the bad guys . Having worked in the Utility space, I can tell you this conversion to electric cars in the next 10 years is not going to happen even close to that fast - the infrastructure just can't support it. And as we know, even if it moves that way, no way are renewables even close to filling the 25%+ energy demand to satisfy the thirst. So fossil fuels will still play a big part. So if O&G can just ratchet back their exploration and not increase supplies, Pricing will be back just fine. That and at some point people will see their ESG's underperforming non-ESG funds and then the real money will start to get pointed in these stocks direction. So I think next 5 years these will all be double vs current prices."
Sold BP and bought Exxon after 12 years of downtrend only to read today that BP is buying Exxon too. I should pat myself on the back.
It only costs BP about $1 billion to resume the previous dividend each quarter.
