$BSM $CDEV $ET $PAA $BPLoading up the truck on $BSM @ 9.50 & 9.55Just accumulating more - firmly believe it's a $13.50+ stkwithin 6 mos. USA has not seen the HIGH for Crude yet this yr.Too much capx underspent over the past 12 mos. & inventories arelow thru out the world - again it only takes one crisis in the Middle Eastto trigger $100/bbl. Of course all these dividend stks are going to eventually raise their annual dividends by yr end as well. GLTA
"I think all these O&G are oversold, but at some point investment houses are going to see the yield alone is too strong to resist. Right now we are very unpopular - while we power the world, everyone wants to make it like we're the bad guys . Having worked in the Utility space, I can tell you this conversion to electric cars in the next 10 years is not going to happen even close to that fast - the infrastructure just can't support it. And as we know, even if it moves that way, no way are renewables even close to filling the 25%+ energy demand to satisfy the thirst. So fossil fuels will still play a big part. So if O&G can just ratchet back their exploration and not increase supplies, Pricing will be back just fine. That and at some point people will see their ESG's underperforming non-ESG funds and then the real money will start to get pointed in these stocks direction. So I think next 5 years these will all be double vs current prices."
Oil supply stopped due to major hurricane...higher gas prices equals $30 BP.
"Reported: bp repurchased 111,639,620.00 ordinary shares in London in August ending 8/26/21"
"I have owned by since 16 dollars and added along the way, it is stable and pays a dividend which helps. I truest believe a correction is near and a housing bubble crash is highly likely when interest rates start to hike a ARM loans payment spike along with rental evictions in high numbers likely within months. BP is a great stick to hold against inflation and DRV is a short against the housing market. Even in high markets great opportunities do exist to make money! Be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy. At today’s market highs it’s greed so it’s time to be fearful! A quote from Warren Buffet!"
Anyone read the Barron's news on BP buying and doubling their position in XOM shares? My questions why?
"$LPI $CPE $CDEV $BP University of Florida predicts Rona D peak on August 24th, and herd immunity in Florida by September 11. Other states will follow. The market will reverse, despite what CNN is telling you."
Facebook market cap over one trillion. This must be some kind of joke. Its worth more than all US oil companies combined. Thats an even bigger joke.
(http://Stocks-tracker.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Reported: Iraq approves BP plan to spin off giant Rumaila oilfieldinto a separate company jointly owned by bp and CNPC.
"BP is probably one of the most unloved stocks in an unloved sector. When it finally becomes obvious to investors that fossil fuel will remain dominant for another 30 years at the very least, and that trillions of dollars in profits will be made selling fossil fuel and it's vast array of by-products, then the sector may reach a fair valuation level.."
Bp will buy back 1 billion per qrtr. At $25 per share thats 40 million shares a qrtr - 160 million per year. 4.7% of the float bought back annually. That alone reduces dividend cost to company and increases eps.
Recent article says BP bought shares of XOM. Obviously they prefer XOM shares to BP.
"Average Brent oil price for 3rd qtr, 2021ending 8/11/21 is $74.18."
"I’m describing this as a stubborn ox. It’s just won’t move, but when it does, there will be no stopping it!"
bp is the cheapest major oil company. but the problem remains mangement is just too focussed on the short term. i dont get why they just up working capital+ invest in their already existing assets to prevent spills.at this point its just waiting before someone else does it. shell already wanted to buy bp once and maybe chevron is going to try and merge with them beacuse bp just has way more operations then chevron.
Oil staying above 65 should mean bp hitting 30 sometime this year or next
They need to stop share repurchase and increase dividend. That is the only way to increase stock in any meaningful way. Share repurchase is just a cloak on how many shares they issues to the undeserving BoD and Looney.
"With BP spinning off the Iraq assets, what do BP stock holders get from this transaction? This is a valuable asset and I don’t see where anything of value is being exchanged. I will be voting against Looney and the board at the next stockholder meeting."
Can we expect a large spike Monday with IDA in play?
"Reported: bp repurchased 104,514,620 ordinary shares in London in August ending 8/24/21 or.0052 of total outstanding shares."
BP doing a great job. Just need to focus on improving ROI/Profit.
"“Crude oil has seen what’s called a Golden Cross on its weekly chart,”“That’s only happened 3 times since 2000 and each of those 3 times has been followed by a very strong further rally in crude oil, anywhere from 20%-50%,” Maley told CNBC.https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Could-Be-Primed-For-Up-To-50-Rally-Strategist-Says.htmlhttps://challenger23.com/post/50172533016/higher-higher-hard-to-believe-its-been-a"
With Grandpa Joe cutting US future oil production BP looks solid going forward.
Hard to believe w/ them buying back as many shares as they have that the price moves lower.
"will hurricane Ida have a short term negative impact on RDS-A and BP share prices, since they are shutting down rigs in anticipation?"
Reported: bp repurchased 75.79 million shares in London in August ending 8/17/21.
The most under valued oil major.
"At some point when the MMs and whales are finished stealing shares, oil stocks have to trade closer to reasonable valuations. For kicks, I calculated 2021 & 2022 combined average PE ratios (based on Non- GAAP quarterly EPS consensus estimates in my Merrill Edge trading platform with today's prices) for the O & G stocks I own. $CPE : 2.93 (quarterly projections probably don't include recent acquisition) $LPI : 2.29$BCEI : 5 (also pays dividend)$BP : 7.95 (also pays dividend)$SBOW : 1.96$WTI : 4.29Good luck longs. And shorts, I've been enjoying your meaningless price targets that you post like every 10 minutes on these boards that include no data to back them up whatsoever. Enjoyable comedy!"
Cheap
"Everybody wants in before the X-Dividend Thursday. Question is how will price react post X-Div? Looks like the funds are repositioning one more time before the run up, oil is just before gapping up IMO, has been a steady climb for last 3 weeks, hope it holds."
M/A or a direct purchase of BP will happen if the share price remains in the current range. It is just tremendously undervalued.
"BP's treasury is getting a complete gift here being able to buy back shares at this price with Brent at $70 bbl. The market is just insane. Too many people using technical analysis and algorithms and ignoring fundamentals, then heavily dosed with millennial woke screwballs that think reality is a narrative...I suppose it is in la-la land."
A big part of Bps business is nat gas....today almost at 5 years high and Europe is getting strained for LNG due to demand
There went entire gain from outstanding Quarter total BS buying more
I see that BP wants to buy back stock. What does it mean when a company buys back their stock?

"Reported: bp repurchased 118,953,082 ordinary shares in Londonin August ending 8/27/21."
"If you love this company and believe it will do well in the future, especially with the buyback and the slightly increased dividend. Then you might want to buy while it's on sale, instead of complaining about the low price.Right?I mean, if you want to make money and you know this company will do that for you... Act accordingly. Be happy to buy it on sale! We all agree this should be at $30. And I'm sure it will be... Do you want to buy at $30 or $25? I like $25!"
Reported: bp repurchased 82.9 million shares in London in August ending 8/18/21 (today).
