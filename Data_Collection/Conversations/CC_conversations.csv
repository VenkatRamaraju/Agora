"It’s straight forward, the next 2 years wold be the most profitable for food travel and restaurant industry… the pent up demand is unimaginable in addition to the sequential growth. Needless to say, refrigerants will be in high demand. With pe of 18 for a growth stock with dividend, I see huge upside for cc. I am accumulating!"
Best under the radar stock with over 5% dividend. Dividend announced before earning report signaling positive report to come.
"now that we can't get raw materials due to storms in Louisiana and China, we will probably go down to low twenties... Ouch this is gonna hurt a little"
"Just bought in here on Thursday. Looks like some serious upside potential, and the 6% dividend is a plus."
Great earnings and revenue growth. Will March on to top $30 tomorrow or next week!
can there be one day where CC holds it's morning gain?
BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!!!17.33+1.26 (+7.81%)As of 12:34 PM EDT. 10/23/19 Market open.
"just listened to sherwin williams conference call. they expect tio2 prices for stay stable....which is quite opposite of what was said during PPG's call on jan 17th (the day last downturn in CC and other tio2 producers' stock price started) hopefully, market takes this a positive sign...but i guess only time will tell."
Looks like short-sellers have control right now. Looking for CC to bottom somewhere near the $25 range. Legal environmental issues appear to be the reason for the shorts. You can throw a poor 1st qtr in there as well.
What environmental problem does CC have. Appreciate a learned comment. Thanks.
"For those who have been trading this stock for a while, this was the perfect morning wave!"
"TROX offer was for $27 but the stock is at $25. that is way too big a spread for arbitrage. the market must think that deal is not happening. Many seem to think the offer is a low ball, but if rejected, will the price go back down to 21.in either case, it shows that CC and TROX are undervalued."
Running up today
"I’m long...but if I weren’t, I wouldn’t go long or add at the moment. No need to be hero right now. Wait till things get clearer on Tio2 prices and George political issues. Looks like Chinese producers are increasing prices (check out tio2.info) but they are increasing due to wrong reason (raw material costs rising after closing rio tinto mine in South Africa."
So the plant modifications updates are complete...this company ready for production?
Looks like CC is capped at 2 Billion over 20 years Max. This should remove a boat anchor on the share price in the future. CC won’t be on the hook for 100% of the liabilities .
Very nice ride up ... GLTA LONGS HERE !!!!!
Seems to be of greater value than TROX
How can one short a stock trading at a forward P/E multiple of 5.5X?
"Another 52 week low today at 27.40. And this is a nicely positive day for the market. I think we are seeing year-end tax loss selling. Should be a set-up for more positive pricing later on but looks like a deep value stock based on PE, dividend, & cash flow. However, we are late in the bull cycle and may be ending in 2019. Would not bet the farm at this point."
Solid profitable co paying an almost 6% dividend on the list of Kipling as one of the 20 best stocks for 2020! What not to like as an investment?
"Don’t sell folks... don’t let the big guys steal your shares !! Always the little guys panic and sell, it’s the truth. You need to stick to your game plan and let the stock recover. This 4th Qtr earnings will be great  and this thing will pop to $18 and $20 in a few weeks after. The USA  economy is doing well."
"This seems really undervalued right now, is this worth buying at $16.50?"
"I’ve been a CC shareholder since 2018. And, what a great investment it has been! I doubled my holdings April 2020 when the stock dipped due to Covid. I then added significantly again to my position this past April.. and honestly, I wish I had bought more! This is by far my favorite holding. I continue to be impressed with their overall performance, and the stewardship of their management team. The dividend is awesome, and the stock value just keeps going steadily/reliably UP! I believe this trend will continue. I think Chemours will be in the mid 40’s in a matter of a few months, if not a few weeks. Recommended CC to my brother.... I’m that confident on this one."
I’m a buyer here. Profit taking on top of dividend equals buying opportunity
Why would you want to tender your 7% 2025 senior notes for basically par? Aren’t they worth more than par with interest rates where they are? I would feel they were pretty secure from CC. Then they are going to replace them with other senior unsecured notes at I’m sure a lower coupon. Wall Street and our investment banks will make it happen I’m sure but it sounds crazy to me.
short ratio of 10 and earnings beat....hmmmm
"Same position as Joeri. But, if the numbers on Yahoo are correct then this is still a buy. PE of less then 4 based on 2020 earnings. High dividend. Current ratio of 1.96 and 2020 growth rate of 44%. i am buying more. Anyone know why the stock went up today?"
finally bought into CC energized bull 
When does this stock climb out of the bottom and stay there? Whe will see $40 and moving up?
peter is way too active on CC discussion. I guess he is short big time.
why is noone saying anything about this near term low ? any info ?
what just happened?
"Positives of why CC is undervalued...1)Titanium dioxide , Chemours has a huge moat. They have the most cost effective process . There are only a handful of large players that produce at scale and CC is the top producer, Paint and coatings will explode due to home improvement due to COVID and production starting back up in automotive 2) Opteon platform. ( this is why I bought) ozone neutral refrigerants will become standard issue. R134 is being phased out in new car construction for R134yf . Opteon refrigerants will be used in all refrigerators / Ac ECT as regulations necessitate 3) Dividend safe. Well capitalized company with no major debt due for years4) liabilities ( this was the biggest hurdle and remains to be seen how it plays out) with all the suing back and forth between DuPunt / Chemours and Chemours/ various plaintiffs , this was a lingering concern and cause for the stock drop last year. It seems that DuPont realizes it just can’t toss its legacy liabilities on a spin off company and walk away. Comments from the DuPont CEO reguarding this was a renegotiation of the spin off agreement. This will take some time but it appears that Chemours will not be on the hook for 100% of the liabilities Just a few thought of why I bought back in March"
"It will be interesting to see how many shares they bought back in November-December when the price was in the mid 20's. 5.7 million (~3.3% of the total shares) were bought back in the prior quarter as of October 29, 2018."
"CC has almost 1 Billion in cash, according to Yahoo"
Ooops pulled the trigger a bit early. Why the drop?
"what is going on with this stock? I bought in at 16.90 on Jan. 7th. Yahoo has this yearly estimate to 22 something.?? Kiplinger's magazine has an article saying CC is a buy?? This has been going down ever since I bought in. The market goes up one day CC goes down. The market goes down one day CC goes down even farther?? Now Tom is thinking this will hit sub 13. I get a feeling this will never go into 22, why does yahoo finance think this is going to sub 22? I wanted income from this stock but not a loss as this. It will take alot of dividends to build up to break even. Not putting more money into this. jmho"
The CEO bought $1 million in shares on the open market at $23/share two weeks ago. It seems longs are in good shape to load up at $21...
Something bad seems to be looming based on the price downtrend. Also insider selling.
"Bought at $7.07, sold at $10.50! Awaiting the next entry point!"
I just had to buy more today $1 dividend at this price is a good deal.
"So much money hit this thing this morning, and as is usually the case, 10.30 rolls around and buyers disappear"
"CC will continue to produce great results from this point forward until the end of the year. As summer is approaching North America, Europe and Asia will be using a lot of the freon to keep them cool. Mining products and other chemicals this summer will only get this stock to a fantastic run to a better than ever performance. Let's get to $40.00 by the end of the month!"
why the upside in ah
bought today at 15.73
CC has delivered again. A great co with much demanded products and pays a nice dividend to boot. Can’t ask for more from one’s investment.
"with the stimulus pkg including big money for HVAC upgrades in 10's of thousands of schools across the country, and mining chemicals only likely to go up, it seems that CC has some upside runway."
"What do long time holders read into the lack of a dividend increase, holding at $.25 … ?Thx."
This is basic materials that are overwhelming used in construction. Paint and air conditioners. Both paint and HVAC companies have reported record sales. I expect CC will follow.
I wonder what happened to the$18-20 at end of week. I’m guessing it was a pump. Really believe this is a $30-$40 stock. Just haven’t seen it lately.
"Based on Chemours' public statements, we believe Chemours has been a successful company since its spinoff in July 2015. We have no reason to believe Chemours is insolvent or otherwise unable to manage the liabilities allocated to it in the Separation Agreement – either today or at any point since it became an independent company. Indeed, Chemours has similarly demonstrated confidence in its financial position by returning more than $1 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks."
"I booked a 52% loss when I sold today. I'll be honest when I say I didn't perform my due diligence and just used simple income and P/E metrics to make a small purchase. I was hoping it would rise a couple more bucks a share, but I figure this is a good escape point. The likely future litigation for short-chain chemically similar compounds to the long-chain compounds Chemours has been sued over has me worried. With Dark Waters coming out later this month, I'm jumping ship before it tests new all time lows."
anyone know why its down today?
The trend is our friend! With a little momentum this could surge to 45-50. Solid company with former executive in White House will help with legal issues. This is a hidden gem ready to explode.
Down on Judges decision on the case against DuPont. I bought in because of Opteon. I sell this product for automotive applications. Although most cars didn’t start using this till a couple years ago. This will be a big Market when R134 phases out. The problem is even the USA market is flooded with Chinese imported Freon. Although the cost now is comparable...
"I don't have a lot of shares, but I'm in at $12.86 + enjoy the dividend. Received my first shares as a result of the spinoff and subsequently bought a few more along the line. Like others here, I regret not hitting the buy button for a few more."
Sold at $19. Will buy again at the next plummet.
New 52 week high above 30 coming soon
Anyone on here with a good future report of some sorts on CC. Any articles or information would be appreciated
"Negotiations on with DuPont which will restructure the liabilities during the spin-off. Also, earnings surprise of over 30% and decreased capEx and keeping dividend and no debt due any time soon. All a plus."
Beautiful! Good money these days. Go higher please.
This is a great entry point to buy CC before it hits $22 - $25... so shorties cover and go long you will make big bucks.
"Why in the world is this down, after what appeared to be a much better than expected and even hoped for earnings report? What may have caused the precipitous drop after the initial run up?"
Why is this tanking?
Started a very small position with the intend to add and average down. Bought at 11.79... Up like a rocket since then... What to do now? I'm not buying at these levels now
I do believe CC will see quite a bit of positive action for some time!
Don’t understand why its share price keeps dropping despite the market. The only saving grace is the oversized dividend. Hope that doesn’t get cut. Waiting for next earnings CC and see if there is real problem in this co.
Most chemical companies produce a commodity product. Their fortunes are determined by the ebb and flows of the economy. What differentiates CC from the rest of the pack is the global push for low Global warming potential products. The Opteon platform is the 800 pound gorilla with requard to refrigerants. The automotive industry has adopted it and now consumer companies have started. Sky is the limit
"The ""judge"" on CNBC interviewing David Eichhorn (sp) mentioned CC... FWIW!"
"f you don’t already own this....no need to buy. This stock is very broken. ..all trends point to test of October lows. If those break, then $11.9. down days come with big volume. Add or buy when picture is clear...even company stopped buying back shares. They didn’t buy any last quarter...and looks like they are not doing any right now either. And insiders haven’t open up third pockets in last three months. Not sure who is selling though...there was one big holder ...dan loeb...who sold last quarter. Can’t think who would be selling it this quarter. The remainder big holders were buyers last quarter."
"Looks like I will be able to buy back in around $13 sooner than I thought. Of course, if it is still dropping rapidly at that point I will wait. Remember, this is a great stock to trade but don't hold it for long."
"Chemours Company is getting kinda pricey up here just shorted 15,000 shares at $21,55 will cover today at $21.00 for a profit  ... I love the game. So far is has been my best year trading ever !!"
"With 5.5% annual yield at current share price, I consider CC is a good buy."
"Good dividend, low PE, decent earnings, and close to the 52 low. What's not to like?"
Divi cash going into everybody’s account today. Wonder if there is a connection. Had a good run up recently also
Got in at $43.83
Y’all have to understand that these big price fluctuations without any news are just that....price fluctuations.
"Bad enough the virus, but what impact will a major correction on the stock market have on people’s retirement savings. How will people adjust spending."
"basic materials, chemicals, energy are all getting sold off today - big investors rotating sectors and betting that cyclical run is over. It's not, so hold tight."
just getting punished for no news
Why is this board so quiet? Anyone have input on why this has been going down a lot last two days?

And up she goes... GL longs !!
I bought CC when Charles Payne recommended it at $48.55 a share. Big mistake.
Mining companies are ramping up production and CC produces the reactant chemicals required in the industry. I added 1k shares Friday and feel very confident that this trade will pay off nicely.
Chemours will beat the earnings expectations
In the next 2-5 years you will see all HVAC manufacturers shifting to new refrigerants that will rely mostly on Chemours new refrigerants

Thank you CC. It was wise choice to take the dips.
how is CC affected by the titanium dioxide issues affecting the food coloring industry?
"Should have done my research before buying this today @16.00..The CEO played the same stunt last qtr by selling big & buying small but making a big splash about the buying part to pump up the stock.. The co has some good IP value & patents but is in earnings decline.. This will rise just a bit prior to earninbgs but all sideways to downhill from here...Have to bite the bullet & sell tomorrow,, Got greedy & broke my own rules for buying in a hurry on the dip.."

"Chemours will see the light at the end of the tunnel in this entire charade:Chemours' management is actively buying back stock. CEO Mr. Vergnano had bought over $1m worth of shares in June. Furthermore, SVP David Shelton and TT President Snell E Bryan bought over $200k and $165k worth of shares, respectively, just this August. More recently, COO Mark Newman acquired around $330k worth of shares in September.Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn added a new ""mid-sized"" $52m position of Chemours in 1Q 2019 - reaffirming the position that pessimism has been overblown. Other intrinsic-value-focused funds such as Third Point LLC have also increased positions in Chemours.Chemours' stock price is currently well below its book value of $26.31 - leaving a nice margin of safety at 60%.In conclusion, we believe that our original thesis on Chemours is still fundamentally intact - and the current bout of lawsuits coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty has depressed its stock price way below our fair value of $50.50."
"The attempted buyout of TROX, CC’s biggest competitor, tells me that these materials are undervalued."
"$ 500 M worth of shares retired as of Q2, and another 750M worth of shares to be retired for the rest of the year plus Value Stabilization at play for second half of year at play."
"On 'Fast Halftime Report' , Jenny Harrington said CC with it's major refrigeration division is a great play on 'Global Warming'https://www.cnbc.com/jenny-harrington/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CC/profile?p=CC"
"That's every air conditioner in every automobile, and every building and house in the world for Opteum. How much is that worth to the company? Is this a 500 dollar stock? Not a lot of shares available either."
"The new news regarding the Ex-DuPont CEO backtracking on her testimony on Chemours liabilities is GREAT for Chemours' case. If she says that DuPont meant for Chemours to have ""uncapped"" liabilities, then the application to incorporate Chemours in Delaware in 2015 would have been rejected. DuPont therefore defrauded Delaware into incorporating Chemours as a spinoff with the full intent of Chemours going bankrupt and/or insolvent within a predictable timeframe, which is totally illegal."
I think no need to to buy or add at this time. It seems There’s one big short seller at this time...who is shorting big time....and no big buyer in the other side (not even company buy back or executives doing symbolic buys to show confidence in the company ). This should continue for next few weeks...till earnings. No need to be a hero. Assess the situation after earnings are out.Beware that Shorts are in full control right now...
This is an excellent stock to buy and hold for a long time. Great dividend and new products have an excellent growth potential. The more I research the more I like CC. It’s a strong buy in my book !!
"Solid Qtr:Net Sales of $1.3 billionNet Income of $100 million, with EPS of $0.61Adjusted Net Income of $118 million, with Adjusted EPS of $0.71Adjusted EBITDA of $257 millionOn April 28th, the company's board of directors approved a Q2 dividend of $0.25 per share, consistent with the prior quarter"
Earnings whisper says 4:30 pm est...what is wrong with this company?
I told you all that CC was at a great entry point and it was going to rocket !! We will see $13 by next Friday.
Nice numbers released today! Up we go
Everyone still Long?????!! Problem about value investing is you have to stay strong.
I just had to buy CC at $12.02 wish me luck. I hope it won't go lower.
I was also burnd by GE.Management croocks.Paid. 30 dollar share..Sold at 14..dollard a share
"With both growth in earnings and revenue coupled with nice dividend, this is so undervalued as being ridiculously cheap. Recent news about products being adopted further strengthens its future outlook. This is one of the top stocks to accumulate during this heated stock markets for so many stocks."
Just muted Peter. My headache will vanish I hope 
"Good dividend, worth holding a position"
"I have to ask, why is there a Lawsuit against this company. If one looks at the numbers the facts IMHO point to over valuation. The book value is what a bit over $5 per share and the debt is huge. Yet it trades at 3X book value. It is looking like a lot of people including hedge funds either did not do their homework or are shorting the shares. Also the last three quarters they only met the numbers one out of the three and missed the other two. I will wait myself until the company turns around its earnings. Seems some of management got out at the high when they sold some of their shares. But for me, this company has too much debt and could fall further if they continue to disappoint . JMHO. disclosure do not own or short any shares at this time."
Why in the hXXX down over 3% without news. The only news I found wasThe Chemours Company Named a Top Workplace in Delaware for the Second Consecutive Year by Wilmington's The News Journal Newspaper
I just bought too - 3000 shares at avg cost of $14.43. We are going to make a lot of money!!!Don't forget to sell covered calls for additional funds!!!
There's a lot more open PUT contracts than CALLS if you click on the options tab above and look at the standard options that expire on 3rd Friday of the month. % short is also slightly elevated. Options and shorts are the smart money. Be careful on this stock in short term.

Not sure what has caused CC's stock price to drop from about 40 to 34 and change today in a few weeks. Have seen no news that would cause the drop. Overall the market has been strong. Earnings out today after the close. Anticipation of weak earnings maybe?
"No run up in price ahead of dividend, especially after a great earnings report. Something seems very very off here."
Very happy with this stock. Getting paid by share price appreciation and a good dividend. Excellent earnings and revenue just reported. Will be above $40 soon.
"On the earnings history tab here on Yahoo, I see quarterly earnings for the last 4 quarters as 0.59, 0.56, 0.71 and 0.18 respectively. That totals $2.03 for for the TTM. So how come the PE ratio still shows N/A? Shouldn't it show PE of 10+/- with current price hovering around $20+/-? What am I missing?"
"i wish we could get past this next earnings report. I expect a miss with guidance confirmed.after that, the stock can go back up."
Loaded up again this morning. Got in at $13.78. Now average in at $13.93. Going to gym now... so relaxed. :)
"The smart money knows something is wrong, which is why stock is plummeting. Large lawsuit about to be announced? Large write down of assets? Profitable revenue growth and expanding margins may no longer be the primary goals of this management team as they appear to have fully adopted a politically correct culture. When a company becomes more concerned about management quotas to ensure diversity and social responsibilities than it does on improving stock price and shareholder returns, it usually doesn't bode well for shareholders. I suspect there's a lot of disgruntled middle management employees who have been passed over because in favor of someone less qualified, and lot of management resources being diverted to social and sustainability responsibilities which usually increases costs and lowers profit margins."
This company's stock will be over $25 a share in 3 months time. Don't believe the comments from those that are trying to short it for their gain.
Does anyone know what % of income derives from Ti02? I think its well over 59% but I could be wrong.
"we love this company. great dividend too, kick back let them do their job and you will be fine, really. "
"With everything else getting pounded the last few days, CC seems to be holding its recent gains fairly well."
