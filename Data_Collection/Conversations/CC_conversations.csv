Most chemical companies produce a commodity product. Their fortunes are determined by the ebb and flows of the economy. What differentiates CC from the rest of the pack is the global push for low Global warming potential products. The Opteon platform is the 800 pound gorilla with requard to refrigerants. The automotive industry has adopted it and now consumer companies have started. Sky is the limit
When does this stock climb out of the bottom and stay there? Whe will see $40 and moving up?
"now that we can't get raw materials due to storms in Louisiana and China, we will probably go down to low twenties... Ouch this is gonna hurt a little"
how is CC affected by the titanium dioxide issues affecting the food coloring industry?
I bought CC when Charles Payne recommended it at $48.55 a share. Big mistake.
anyone know why its down today?
Something bad seems to be looming based on the price downtrend. Also insider selling.
"I’ve been a CC shareholder since 2018. And, what a great investment it has been! I doubled my holdings April 2020 when the stock dipped due to Covid. I then added significantly again to my position this past April.. and honestly, I wish I had bought more! This is by far my favorite holding. I continue to be impressed with their overall performance, and the stewardship of their management team. The dividend is awesome, and the stock value just keeps going steadily/reliably UP! I believe this trend will continue. I think Chemours will be in the mid 40’s in a matter of a few months, if not a few weeks. Recommended CC to my brother.... I’m that confident on this one."
"SW revised their Q3 sales estimate downward due to supply chain problems from Ida. If they can't make enough paint due to supply problems, then that could mean they will also delay buying TiO2. Not a huge deal, but would push some sales from Q3 to Q4."
"It’s straight forward, the next 2 years wold be the most profitable for food travel and restaurant industry… the pent up demand is unimaginable in addition to the sequential growth. Needless to say, refrigerants will be in high demand. With pe of 18 for a growth stock with dividend, I see huge upside for cc. I am accumulating!"
"with the stimulus pkg including big money for HVAC upgrades in 10's of thousands of schools across the country, and mining chemicals only likely to go up, it seems that CC has some upside runway."
"TROX offer was for $27 but the stock is at $25. that is way too big a spread for arbitrage. the market must think that deal is not happening. Many seem to think the offer is a low ball, but if rejected, will the price go back down to 21.in either case, it shows that CC and TROX are undervalued."
"Positives of why CC is undervalued...1)Titanium dioxide , Chemours has a huge moat. They have the most cost effective process . There are only a handful of large players that produce at scale and CC is the top producer, Paint and coatings will explode due to home improvement due to COVID and production starting back up in automotive 2) Opteon platform. ( this is why I bought) ozone neutral refrigerants will become standard issue. R134 is being phased out in new car construction for R134yf . Opteon refrigerants will be used in all refrigerators / Ac ECT as regulations necessitate 3) Dividend safe. Well capitalized company with no major debt due for years4) liabilities ( this was the biggest hurdle and remains to be seen how it plays out) with all the suing back and forth between DuPunt / Chemours and Chemours/ various plaintiffs , this was a lingering concern and cause for the stock drop last year. It seems that DuPont realizes it just can’t toss its legacy liabilities on a spin off company and walk away. Comments from the DuPont CEO reguarding this was a renegotiation of the spin off agreement. This will take some time but it appears that Chemours will not be on the hook for 100% of the liabilities Just a few thought of why I bought back in March"
"i wish we could get past this next earnings report. I expect a miss with guidance confirmed.after that, the stock can go back up."

Divi cash going into everybody’s account today. Wonder if there is a connection. Had a good run up recently also
"The attempted buyout of TROX, CC’s biggest competitor, tells me that these materials are undervalued."
"The ""judge"" on CNBC interviewing David Eichhorn (sp) mentioned CC... FWIW!"
"What do long time holders read into the lack of a dividend increase, holding at $.25 … ?Thx."
Seems to be of greater value than TROX
