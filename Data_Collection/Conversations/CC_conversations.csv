"with the stimulus pkg including big money for HVAC upgrades in 10's of thousands of schools across the country, and mining chemicals only likely to go up, it seems that CC has some upside runway."
"Same position as Joeri. But, if the numbers on Yahoo are correct then this is still a buy. PE of less then 4 based on 2020 earnings. High dividend. Current ratio of 1.96 and 2020 growth rate of 44%. i am buying more. Anyone know why the stock went up today?"
"I don't have a lot of shares, but I'm in at $12.86 + enjoy the dividend. Received my first shares as a result of the spinoff and subsequently bought a few more along the line. Like others here, I regret not hitting the buy button for a few more."
finally bought into CC energized bull 
Anyone know why it jumped almost 4 % at around 2:30 pm with very significant volume.
Running up today
"Just picked up 2,500 shares of CC at $15.30 couldn’t resist. Will buy more tomorrow after my research. This looks like a winner folks."

I heard CC employees are being “voluntold” to take two weeks off without pay between now and next March to save cash. Any employees here that can verify that?
anyone know why its down today?
Very good news !! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chemours-company-successfully-installs-opteon-130000117.html
Price target now 47$
"On the earnings history tab here on Yahoo, I see quarterly earnings for the last 4 quarters as 0.59, 0.56, 0.71 and 0.18 respectively. That totals $2.03 for for the TTM. So how come the PE ratio still shows N/A? Shouldn't it show PE of 10+/- with current price hovering around $20+/-? What am I missing?"
Does anyone know what % of income derives from Ti02? I think its well over 59% but I could be wrong.
I bought CC when Charles Payne recommended it at $48.55 a share. Big mistake.
"i wish we could get past this next earnings report. I expect a miss with guidance confirmed.after that, the stock can go back up."
"And the buyers (including company buyback) strike continues...meanwhile, sellers (including shorts) are in full force."
This stock should be in the 40s min.!

"Another 52 week low today at 27.40. And this is a nicely positive day for the market. I think we are seeing year-end tax loss selling. Should be a set-up for more positive pricing later on but looks like a deep value stock based on PE, dividend, & cash flow. However, we are late in the bull cycle and may be ending in 2019. Would not bet the farm at this point."
And up she goes... GL longs !!
"This seems really undervalued right now, is this worth buying at $16.50?"
Signals are pointing to big guys getting back in today
Loaded up again this morning. Got in at $13.78. Now average in at $13.93. Going to gym now... so relaxed. :)
What environmental problem does CC have. Appreciate a learned comment. Thanks.
In the next 2-5 years you will see all HVAC manufacturers shifting to new refrigerants that will rely mostly on Chemours new refrigerants
"Great opportunity to average down. I say that, but I'll probably sell instead."
"Why people thumbs down when I said 7-9 price target buy?Be happy, its almost there. This is commodity stock. Will fly from $5 back to $50 probably."
dec 9th I seen is one of deadline for lawsuit
"With both growth in earnings and revenue coupled with nice dividend, this is so undervalued as being ridiculously cheap. Recent news about products being adopted further strengthens its future outlook. This is one of the top stocks to accumulate during this heated stock markets for so many stocks."
"I booked a 52% loss when I sold today. I'll be honest when I say I didn't perform my due diligence and just used simple income and P/E metrics to make a small purchase. I was hoping it would rise a couple more bucks a share, but I figure this is a good escape point. The likely future litigation for short-chain chemically similar compounds to the long-chain compounds Chemours has been sued over has me worried. With Dark Waters coming out later this month, I'm jumping ship before it tests new all time lows."

"Looking closely at CC... it looks very compelling at these low levels and it pays a very high dividend. Doing my research tonight on this and possibly buying 5,000 shares tomorrow."
How can one short a stock trading at a forward P/E multiple of 5.5X?
"Thanks to Trump, 50 is long gone."
I was also burnd by GE.Management croocks.Paid. 30 dollar share..Sold at 14..dollard a share
Earnings whisper says 4:30 pm est...what is wrong with this company?
I’m a buyer here. Profit taking on top of dividend equals buying opportunity
"Based on Chemours' public statements, we believe Chemours has been a successful company since its spinoff in July 2015. We have no reason to believe Chemours is insolvent or otherwise unable to manage the liabilities allocated to it in the Separation Agreement – either today or at any point since it became an independent company. Indeed, Chemours has similarly demonstrated confidence in its financial position by returning more than $1 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks."
bought today at 15.73
Keep in mind that this is a high beta stock!
is it buying time or crying time
They had a good report and good expectations for 2020 so this is a buy right now!
Done with this made 2k
aftermarket sells 200 shares. someone's trying to play scare the cat.
"What do long time holders read into the lack of a dividend increase, holding at $.25 … ?Thx."
"now that we can't get raw materials due to storms in Louisiana and China, we will probably go down to low twenties... Ouch this is gonna hurt a little"
This is an excellent stock to buy and hold for a long time. Great dividend and new products have an excellent growth potential. The more I research the more I like CC. It’s a strong buy in my book !!
if they were smart they would cancel the bloated divided to stock pile cash to settle lawsuits. this gap up is just a shorting opportunity
Why is this board so quiet? Anyone have input on why this has been going down a lot last two days?
Why in the hXXX down over 3% without news. The only news I found wasThe Chemours Company Named a Top Workplace in Delaware for the Second Consecutive Year by Wilmington's The News Journal Newspaper
"Good dividend, low PE, decent earnings, and close to the 52 low. What's not to like?"
I just bought too - 3000 shares at avg cost of $14.43. We are going to make a lot of money!!!Don't forget to sell covered calls for additional funds!!!
Just muted Peter. My headache will vanish I hope 
Analysts have this thing making 4 plus dollars a share next year. Wow that would be a great start to a recovery
Seems to be of greater value than TROX
I do believe CC will see quite a bit of positive action for some time!
why the upside in ah
"Chemours will see the light at the end of the tunnel in this entire charade:Chemours' management is actively buying back stock. CEO Mr. Vergnano had bought over $1m worth of shares in June. Furthermore, SVP David Shelton and TT President Snell E Bryan bought over $200k and $165k worth of shares, respectively, just this August. More recently, COO Mark Newman acquired around $330k worth of shares in September.Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn added a new ""mid-sized"" $52m position of Chemours in 1Q 2019 - reaffirming the position that pessimism has been overblown. Other intrinsic-value-focused funds such as Third Point LLC have also increased positions in Chemours.Chemours' stock price is currently well below its book value of $26.31 - leaving a nice margin of safety at 60%.In conclusion, we believe that our original thesis on Chemours is still fundamentally intact - and the current bout of lawsuits coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty has depressed its stock price way below our fair value of $50.50."
get ready for 13 something and buy then
When does this stock climb out of the bottom and stay there? Whe will see $40 and moving up?
"That's every air conditioner in every automobile, and every building and house in the world for Opteum. How much is that worth to the company? Is this a 500 dollar stock? Not a lot of shares available either."
peter is way too active on CC discussion. I guess he is short big time.
"Good dividend, worth holding a position"
Chemours trading almost at cash on hand. The DuPont verdict was a non event. They will just kick it to a different court. My thought is they may cut dividend at meeting in April
"The attempted buyout of TROX, CC’s biggest competitor, tells me that these materials are undervalued."
i love this stock
BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!!!17.33+1.26 (+7.81%)As of 12:34 PM EDT. 10/23/19 Market open.
"So much money hit this thing this morning, and as is usually the case, 10.30 rolls around and buyers disappear"
"This move down is all about predatory short selling. Algo's and professional shorts are just interested in being able to manipulate stocks down for profit - it is happening in several hundred stocks in dozens of industries over the past 4 - 6 weeks with an acceleration in the past 2 weeks. Has nothing to do with value, quality of company, earnings guidance or anything else. And they don't dare try this garbage with stocks with market cap of $20 Billion or greater because they know that they would get their heads handed to them. So instead they pick on small cap and micro cap stocks (and some mid-caps) which they can bully down to ridiculous levels because these stocks are not in major indices and have few analysts, so there is little institutional awareness of or interest in them and little to none buying support that you would get if they were part of the indices and would be bought each time someone bough that underlying ETF. That makes them the perfect targets for this predatory short selling for fun and profit. Sure TIO2 prices have weakened a bit but not that much and TIO2 is only ONE of CC's three core businesses. HUN should be affected as well, but it has hardly moved. Now to see how MEGAcap chemical stocks are behaving, look no further than the monster DWDP. On most days when chemical stocks go down, DWDP goes UP. Why is that? It's the 800 lb gorilla with 170 BILLION market cap that no one dares to short. Even when they miss earnings estimates the stock STILL goes up! unlike LYB which consistently beats estimates and then gets sold off anyway. This two-tier treatment of megcap vs. small/microcap predominated in late 2015 - early 2016 just like it is doing now. It did ultimately lead to a spectacular rally in small/microcap stocks starting in late Winter 2016 but the obliteration of value was enormously stressful and almost impossible to live through. We are seeing it again but this stealth bear market is being masked by the strength in the major stock indices (SPX, RUT, NDX) led by tech and more specifically by AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, FB, NFLX which together are responsible for almost the entirety of the SPX return in 2018!"
"For those who have been trading this stock for a while, this was the perfect morning wave!"
"CC has almost 1 Billion in cash, according to Yahoo"
Thank you CC. It was wise choice to take the dips.
Solid profitable co paying an almost 6% dividend on the list of Kipling as one of the 20 best stocks for 2020! What not to like as an investment?
Very nice ride up ... GLTA LONGS HERE !!!!!
Most chemical companies produce a commodity product. Their fortunes are determined by the ebb and flows of the economy. What differentiates CC from the rest of the pack is the global push for low Global warming potential products. The Opteon platform is the 800 pound gorilla with requard to refrigerants. The automotive industry has adopted it and now consumer companies have started. Sky is the limit
Looks like short-sellers have control right now. Looking for CC to bottom somewhere near the $25 range. Legal environmental issues appear to be the reason for the shorts. You can throw a poor 1st qtr in there as well.
New 52 week high above 30 coming soon
Anyone on here with a good future report of some sorts on CC. Any articles or information would be appreciated
Mining companies are ramping up production and CC produces the reactant chemicals required in the industry. I added 1k shares Friday and feel very confident that this trade will pay off nicely.
Folks big short squeeze coming to the market and CC shorts will be running  to the doors. I say it’s possible to see $13 in a 6 to 10 days.
Nobody has any insight into this stock? Somebody has to if they are buying and selling 100k shares of stock on here.
So the plant modifications updates are complete...this company ready for production?
Not sure what has caused CC's stock price to drop from about 40 to 34 and change today in a few weeks. Have seen no news that would cause the drop. Overall the market has been strong. Earnings out today after the close. Anticipation of weak earnings maybe?
Initiated a small postion at $ 18.75. Will average down or up depending on price changes.
Divi cash going into everybody’s account today. Wonder if there is a connection. Had a good run up recently also
"Agree that CC has delivered, what a niche company."
just getting punished for no news
What happened today?
7.75 looks good to me. I'm in.
PFAS Action Act still unknown. Stock pumped by whom? Sold position this morning... Tuesday/next week or 2 might be scary for holders. Jmo
How can everyday be a new opportunity?
It's time to buy again..... it'll be $20.00 in a couple of months.... with great dividend!!!
This is killing me. Bought 700 shares at 20.50.. don’t know if I should buy more to bring down the average.
"been here awhile, wish I had more. the usual."
"With 5.5% annual yield at current share price, I consider CC is a good buy."
"I’m long...but if I weren’t, I wouldn’t go long or add at the moment. No need to be hero right now. Wait till things get clearer on Tio2 prices and George political issues. Looks like Chinese producers are increasing prices (check out tio2.info) but they are increasing due to wrong reason (raw material costs rising after closing rio tinto mine in South Africa."
"Don’t sell folks... don’t let the big guys steal your shares !! Always the little guys panic and sell, it’s the truth. You need to stick to your game plan and let the stock recover. This 4th Qtr earnings will be great  and this thing will pop to $18 and $20 in a few weeks after. The USA  economy is doing well."
can there be one day where CC holds it's morning gain?
I told you all that CC was at a great entry point and it was going to rocket !! We will see $13 by next Friday.
The trend is our friend! With a little momentum this could surge to 45-50. Solid company with former executive in White House will help with legal issues. This is a hidden gem ready to explode.
"Negotiations on with DuPont which will restructure the liabilities during the spin-off. Also, earnings surprise of over 30% and decreased capEx and keeping dividend and no debt due any time soon. All a plus."
"Just bought in here on Thursday. Looks like some serious upside potential, and the 6% dividend is a plus."
Why would you want to tender your 7% 2025 senior notes for basically par? Aren’t they worth more than par with interest rates where they are? I would feel they were pretty secure from CC. Then they are going to replace them with other senior unsecured notes at I’m sure a lower coupon. Wall Street and our investment banks will make it happen I’m sure but it sounds crazy to me.
"basic materials, chemicals, energy are all getting sold off today - big investors rotating sectors and betting that cyclical run is over. It's not, so hold tight."
Very happy with this stock. Getting paid by share price appreciation and a good dividend. Excellent earnings and revenue just reported. Will be above $40 soon.
Why is this tanking?
A recovery appears in place. Start a position.
Started a very small position with the intend to add and average down. Bought at 11.79... Up like a rocket since then... What to do now? I'm not buying at these levels now
The CEO bought $1 million in shares on the open market at $23/share two weeks ago. It seems longs are in good shape to load up at $21...
Folks this stock was at $18.21 just a few days ago.. look at the chart. January 14th at $18.21 intraday.
Chemours will beat the earnings expectations
what date is dividend??
15 by end of week? Look at 6-month trending pattern. Manipulation? I'm a buyer again at 14.30-15.
"It will be interesting to see how many shares they bought back in November-December when the price was in the mid 20's. 5.7 million (~3.3% of the total shares) were bought back in the prior quarter as of October 29, 2018."
"Trading for 10x forward earnings guidance with a 4% yield, worth nibbling at for a long term positions"
Increased existing share repurchase authorization to $1 billion from $750 million
Hello  hello .... so what happened... Stock Trader has proved you smart ones wrong again !! Hold on to your share this company will be at $25 in a few weeks. Congratulations to all longs.
same action it had after spinoff from dd yrs ago...had court risk from the Hudson river pollution(who was responsible)...once cleared it ran to 401's....if they touch the div. that will be the. sea change...... but the buy backs sound wonderful reason to put in New bucks ...
This company's stock will be over $25 a share in 3 months time. Don't believe the comments from those that are trying to short it for their gain.
Great earnings and revenue growth. Will March on to top $30 tomorrow or next week!
"With everything else getting pounded the last few days, CC seems to be holding its recent gains fairly well."
Looking good so far today on strong early volume.
Very volatile stock. But most are fearful. Until it’s time to be greedy. That time is now. Too bad my position is 10% higher. I might average down some more
"If the stimulus deal is reached today and Senator Schumer just said it will, CC will go up like a Rocket  !!! Now this the time to buy folks. You will make money "
Good news today about Opteon in Europe boys
we buy a little more each day. just received a great dividend on the 15th. 
"SW revised their Q3 sales estimate downward due to supply chain problems from Ida. If they can't make enough paint due to supply problems, then that could mean they will also delay buying TiO2. Not a huge deal, but would push some sales from Q3 to Q4."
"The new news regarding the Ex-DuPont CEO backtracking on her testimony on Chemours liabilities is GREAT for Chemours' case. If she says that DuPont meant for Chemours to have ""uncapped"" liabilities, then the application to incorporate Chemours in Delaware in 2015 would have been rejected. DuPont therefore defrauded Delaware into incorporating Chemours as a spinoff with the full intent of Chemours going bankrupt and/or insolvent within a predictable timeframe, which is totally illegal."
"Everyone talks about the Charts; the 200 day, the 50 day; the Technicals. Etc, but what counts when you are buying a distress or cheap stock is buying near or at the bottom. I remember when I had 40,000 shares of AMD at $3.15 and everyone was saying sell sell they are going under. True story... AMD continue to go lower in the $2?s and everyone was saying sell... I held on till AMD recovered to $8.50, yes made a lot of money. But I made a big mistake... I listened to Jim Kramer which doesn?t always get it right, and he said on one of his shows if you bought AMD at the lows I would sell before it goes down again when intel comes out with an AMD killer chip. Will never forget... I sold my AMD and AMD it $52 last week. So what am I trying to tell you is that nobody? knows #$%$ ?. We need to do our homework and go with our instincts period !! Right now my instincts tell me CC will be at $20 soon !! The USA ?? economy will be roaring the next 4 years with President Trump !! He is running the country like a business ... wait and see when he starts cutting the illegal Medicare fraud and abusive welfare system. The USA ?? will be winning !!! CC is at the bottom, has good earnings, has a great innovative portfolio of products and it pays a hefty dividend. No to mention a buyback program, I bet you they are buying their own stock now. Buy and hold you will be rewarded ?."
"Costs are currently a barrier for the hydrogen economy.You have 2 main costs that need to be reduced...- Energy required to make green hydrogen- Components of fuel cells and electrolyzersPEM is the predominant version of GLOBAL fuel cell tech.When it comes to PEM membranes ""Nafion"" is the main brand name like Kleenex, Xerox & FedEx.Goolge ""what are the components of a fuel cell""... you will likely find trademarked Nafion name in the article. Improving Nafion membrane technology is key to lowering fuel cell costs.Nafion is manufactured by a DuPont spin off called Chemours....I've made $10s of thousands off Plug, and expect it to be hundred$ of thousand$... but the reality is that Plug is not going to win ALL the contracts..... There are other legit competitors like Nel.Chemours $CC is a nice round out to you hydrogen stock portfolio.Where you can get paid, regardless of who get's these hydrogen project contracts...On the Chemours Q1 conference call, the other week, management basically said people have NO IDEA how their Advanced Materials Division is about to blow up...So much so, that they said that in the next few months they will do an investor presentation, specifically about this division. (they talked specifically about hydrogen.... listen to the call yourself.)This is the division that makes Nafion.I'm all in on hydrogen:PLUGCCHDRO"
Again....co exceeded last 4 quarters. Last year egs 2.22 this year3+ next should be +$4. Div +/- 3%. What's not too like????
"No run up in price ahead of dividend, especially after a great earnings report. Something seems very very off here."
"Positives of why CC is undervalued...1)Titanium dioxide , Chemours has a huge moat. They have the most cost effective process . There are only a handful of large players that produce at scale and CC is the top producer, Paint and coatings will explode due to home improvement due to COVID and production starting back up in automotive 2) Opteon platform. ( this is why I bought) ozone neutral refrigerants will become standard issue. R134 is being phased out in new car construction for R134yf . Opteon refrigerants will be used in all refrigerators / Ac ECT as regulations necessitate 3) Dividend safe. Well capitalized company with no major debt due for years4) liabilities ( this was the biggest hurdle and remains to be seen how it plays out) with all the suing back and forth between DuPunt / Chemours and Chemours/ various plaintiffs , this was a lingering concern and cause for the stock drop last year. It seems that DuPont realizes it just can’t toss its legacy liabilities on a spin off company and walk away. Comments from the DuPont CEO reguarding this was a renegotiation of the spin off agreement. This will take some time but it appears that Chemours will not be on the hook for 100% of the liabilities Just a few thought of why I bought back in March"
"just listened to sherwin williams conference call. they expect tio2 prices for stay stable....which is quite opposite of what was said during PPG's call on jan 17th (the day last downturn in CC and other tio2 producers' stock price started) hopefully, market takes this a positive sign...but i guess only time will tell."
"Looks like I will be able to buy back in around $13 sooner than I thought. Of course, if it is still dropping rapidly at that point I will wait. Remember, this is a great stock to trade but don't hold it for long."
short ratio of 10 and earnings beat....hmmmm
on sale now...due for big breakout. They just invented a new waterproofing agent that's teflon free.
When does the blood letting STOP
CC is refusing to move above $13 and fill the gap. C’mon!
"I’ve been a CC shareholder since 2018. And, what a great investment it has been! I doubled my holdings April 2020 when the stock dipped due to Covid. I then added significantly again to my position this past April.. and honestly, I wish I had bought more! This is by far my favorite holding. I continue to be impressed with their overall performance, and the stewardship of their management team. The dividend is awesome, and the stock value just keeps going steadily/reliably UP! I believe this trend will continue. I think Chemours will be in the mid 40’s in a matter of a few months, if not a few weeks. Recommended CC to my brother.... I’m that confident on this one."
"we love this company. great dividend too, kick back let them do their job and you will be fine, really. "
Chemours leading chemical stocks to the downside at three-year low after German chemical giant BASF (BASFY) warned about Q2 results and lowered FY19 guidance
Down on Judges decision on the case against DuPont. I bought in because of Opteon. I sell this product for automotive applications. Although most cars didn’t start using this till a couple years ago. This will be a big Market when R134 phases out. The problem is even the USA market is flooded with Chinese imported Freon. Although the cost now is comparable...
any discussion on this stock? predictions?
Ooops pulled the trigger a bit early. Why the drop?
"I have to ask, why is there a Lawsuit against this company. If one looks at the numbers the facts IMHO point to over valuation. The book value is what a bit over $5 per share and the debt is huge. Yet it trades at 3X book value. It is looking like a lot of people including hedge funds either did not do their homework or are shorting the shares. Also the last three quarters they only met the numbers one out of the three and missed the other two. I will wait myself until the company turns around its earnings. Seems some of management got out at the high when they sold some of their shares. But for me, this company has too much debt and could fall further if they continue to disappoint . JMHO. disclosure do not own or short any shares at this time."
why is noone saying anything about this near term low ? any info ?
Pfoa/pfas settled today
I think no need to to buy or add at this time. It seems There’s one big short seller at this time...who is shorting big time....and no big buyer in the other side (not even company buy back or executives doing symbolic buys to show confidence in the company ). This should continue for next few weeks...till earnings. No need to be a hero. Assess the situation after earnings are out.Beware that Shorts are in full control right now...
"f you don’t already own this....no need to buy. This stock is very broken. ..all trends point to test of October lows. If those break, then $11.9. down days come with big volume. Add or buy when picture is clear...even company stopped buying back shares. They didn’t buy any last quarter...and looks like they are not doing any right now either. And insiders haven’t open up third pockets in last three months. Not sure who is selling though...there was one big holder ...dan loeb...who sold last quarter. Can’t think who would be selling it this quarter. The remainder big holders were buyers last quarter."
This stock back to 52-54 by july
This company should be trading $25-28 easy. Can not figure out why it’s dropping like a rock
Everyone still Long?????!! Problem about value investing is you have to stay strong.

Got in at $43.83
There's a lot more open PUT contracts than CALLS if you click on the options tab above and look at the standard options that expire on 3rd Friday of the month. % short is also slightly elevated. Options and shorts are the smart money. Be careful on this stock in short term.

I am kinda nervous about this.
"Should have done my research before buying this today @16.00..The CEO played the same stunt last qtr by selling big & buying small but making a big splash about the buying part to pump up the stock.. The co has some good IP value & patents but is in earnings decline.. This will rise just a bit prior to earninbgs but all sideways to downhill from here...Have to bite the bullet & sell tomorrow,, Got greedy & broke my own rules for buying in a hurry on the dip.."

This is basic materials that are overwhelming used in construction. Paint and air conditioners. Both paint and HVAC companies have reported record sales. I expect CC will follow.
"The smart money knows something is wrong, which is why stock is plummeting. Large lawsuit about to be announced? Large write down of assets? Profitable revenue growth and expanding margins may no longer be the primary goals of this management team as they appear to have fully adopted a politically correct culture. When a company becomes more concerned about management quotas to ensure diversity and social responsibilities than it does on improving stock price and shareholder returns, it usually doesn't bode well for shareholders. I suspect there's a lot of disgruntled middle management employees who have been passed over because in favor of someone less qualified, and lot of management resources being diverted to social and sustainability responsibilities which usually increases costs and lowers profit margins."
I wonder what happened to the$18-20 at end of week. I’m guessing it was a pump. Really believe this is a $30-$40 stock. Just haven’t seen it lately.
"Why in the world is this down, after what appeared to be a much better than expected and even hoped for earnings report? What may have caused the precipitous drop after the initial run up?"

"TROX offer was for $27 but the stock is at $25. that is way too big a spread for arbitrage. the market must think that deal is not happening. Many seem to think the offer is a low ball, but if rejected, will the price go back down to 21.in either case, it shows that CC and TROX are undervalued."
Ready for comeback
"CC will continue to produce great results from this point forward until the end of the year. As summer is approaching North America, Europe and Asia will be using a lot of the freon to keep them cool. Mining products and other chemicals this summer will only get this stock to a fantastic run to a better than ever performance. Let's get to $40.00 by the end of the month!"
"Bought at $7.07, sold at $10.50! Awaiting the next entry point!"
Check todays trading April & July puts. I would not touch this for a while.
Don’t understand why its share price keeps dropping despite the market. The only saving grace is the oversized dividend. Hope that doesn’t get cut. Waiting for next earnings CC and see if there is real problem in this co.
I just had to buy CC at $12.02 wish me luck. I hope it won't go lower.
Best under the radar stock with over 5% dividend. Dividend announced before earning report signaling positive report to come.
That was fun!!! Just loaded up again for the next rally!
CC has delivered again. A great co with much demanded products and pays a nice dividend to boot. Can’t ask for more from one’s investment.
"Hoping Einhorn / Greenlight Capital is stepping in today to buy a few more big chunks of this while it's on sale. They currently own ""a medium sized"" position at $23.18: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/david-einhorn-reveals-new-positions-in-chemours-dillards-and-scientific-games.html"
"what is going on with this stock? I bought in at 16.90 on Jan. 7th. Yahoo has this yearly estimate to 22 something.?? Kiplinger's magazine has an article saying CC is a buy?? This has been going down ever since I bought in. The market goes up one day CC goes down. The market goes down one day CC goes down even farther?? Now Tom is thinking this will hit sub 13. I get a feeling this will never go into 22, why does yahoo finance think this is going to sub 22? I wanted income from this stock but not a loss as this. It will take alot of dividends to build up to break even. Not putting more money into this. jmho"
Looks like CC is capped at 2 Billion over 20 years Max. This should remove a boat anchor on the share price in the future. CC won’t be on the hook for 100% of the liabilities .
This is a great entry point to buy CC before it hits $22 - $25... so shorties cover and go long you will make big bucks.
I just had to buy more today $1 dividend at this price is a good deal.
Nice numbers released today! Up we go
Sold at $19. Will buy again at the next plummet.
ouch
Chemours was voted the best place to work in America. Stock is way undervalued right now.
"On 'Fast Halftime Report' , Jenny Harrington said CC with it's major refrigeration division is a great play on 'Global Warming'https://www.cnbc.com/jenny-harrington/https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CC/profile?p=CC"
Beautiful! Good money these days. Go higher please.
"My guess, this got to be related with CC debts and Liabilities falling due within this year, but looking a the balance sheet it's in reasonable good shape. but then again today news will give us an excuse to be bloody red. Cause, I don't see any reason to be this low. Plus we have the rest of the year to make good revenues and be good until the end of the year. Stay strong for the next few days...hopefully we get more news on this soon!"
"Thanks I have just shorted 20,000 shares of CC at $14.15. Let’s see if I can cover at $13.50 for a $13,000 profit."
this thing is more volatile than I would expect
I want to buy 10000 shares right now.
