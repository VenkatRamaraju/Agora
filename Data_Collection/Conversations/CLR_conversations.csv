"""While Russia is said to now be leading the charge in trying to close divisions between the UAE and OPEC, oil may find support in what is shaping up to be yet another massive US (crude) stock draw: 8 million barrels for the week ended July 2, according to API...""https://shipandbunker.com/news/world/188093-oil-plunges-again-despite-unlikelihood-of-calamity-following-stalled-opec-talksThe Russian economy, like all OPEC+ countries, rely on oil to fund their economies.

"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that.

"Hi, here's my story. I've been all oil stock investor for some time now. Currently I own XOM, CVX, COP and CLR. I bought the CLR as a quick trade when it was beaten down last week. After checking the short interest on this one, I'm going to try to hold it in anticipation of a short squeeze. Here's my current opinion:The US Oil Sector services and Oil Majors all went through the bloodbath that was 2020. The stock prices of shale companies began to price in bankruptcy. The energy stock prices right now, are way off of these bankruptcy levels yet far from where the highs from the past couple of years. This does not mean that they are due to return to those high levels any time soon or maybe even ever. The models that the hedge funds use are probably not pricing in $60 WTI for the long term and rightly so, the Feb '22 Contract is $55 and Dec. '22 is a whole $10 cheaper than today at $52. The general value for US Shale breakeven used was said to be $38 or so, but for the sake of higher inflationary costs and steeper production decline curves, lets say the new breakeven for 2021-2023 is $40-$42 per barrel. From today: ""The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects Brent crude oil prices will average $56/b in the first quarter of 2021 and $52/b over the remainder of the year. EIA expects lower oil prices later in 2021 as a result of rising oil supply that will slow the pace of global oil inventory withdrawals. EIA also expects that high global oil inventory levels and spare production capacity will limit upward price pressures. EIA expects Brent prices will average $55/b in 2022""If the models were assuming anything close to the EIA's $52 per barrel, then they may be set up for a disruption if the real price of crude ends of being a steady $60+ a barrel, which I think it will. If and when the futures curve starts to rise and flatten will determine how strong the foundation of the energy stock recovery is. Perhaps the market is seeing this as a temporary oil price spike on the heels of a temporary Saudi cut, a US rig count that was sliced in half, a couple weeks of declining inventory, a 2 month technical rally and now a weather crisis in Texas. Perhaps this is not a temporary oil price spike and it's now settling into the $60-$70 range. If this is the case, I think the sector can work its ways up to within 30% of highs in the next 6 months. Now as for CLR, the short interest is really interesting. The shale drillers pretty much move in unison. If we see stability in the oil price at these levels, and $50 a barrel is no longer in sight, we should see continued upward movement in the sector which should set off some covering as earnings, like those in the past should be imminent. If we get any sort of continuation to the rally we've seen thus far, I would think we could see a short squeeze. If this is the case, I think $60 is on the table. After the Q4 earnings, it looks like analysts are upping their price targets. The company can tackle that 5 billion dollar debt easily at $70-$85 oil which I think we'll see in 2022 although I think they will use a lot of that extra billion dollars per year on cap ex and only slowly pay down the debt. If oil is in a multi year bull run, the companys that are acquiring and investing will continue to look smart in the future. So long story short, this whold thing depends on the price of crude (don't forget nat gas looks bullish too). What we need to see here are the shorts waking up to what should be happending this year, higher futures contracts looking out 6-18 months and complete disruption to the models values for margins and profitability. The price action so far in 2021 is a start, but we're not there yet."
"Executive Chairman Harold Hamm acquired 769,235 shares of CLR 9-25-20 (last Friday). That’s around 6.7 million dollars worth. Interesting would be an understatement.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/732834/000120919120052345/xslF345X03/doc4.xml"
Hamms wife got more money than the current market cap.
Looks like I was correct. Hope you didn't sell.
"I read an article saying that Congress was looking to change the tax laws around Company Share Buybacks. This could potentially change what CLR does with their cash, increasing the amount of stock that they potentially were going to buy back this quarter. I presume the offsetting short-term affect would be a decrease in paying down debt. This should make the stock ""pop' short-term even more than it would for just great earnings...IMHO"
"I mean this in a nice way but CLR must have the dumbest shorts covering them. Have watched them increase their short positions for the last year as CLR continually rose in price. Oil just keeps going up and so does CLR share price, yet these idiotic shorts keep digging their hole deeper and deeper.They are STILL digging their hole deeper as the company buys back shares and is about the announce epic earnings. I feel bad for Wall Street and America if this is the best we have to offer.Granted - they have and continue to make me unfashionably wealthy, big smile! Thanks also Mr. Hamm and the CLR management team, extremely well done!"
"Buybacks clearly work, every time shorts try their scam ... buyer appears and shorts don’t get out of their trap as it appears buyer take their shorting to the bank. Sure looks like shorts are about to be taken to the good old woodshed on 1Nov. I can’t wait to see if they are STILL 11M shares short a 60M float.PRICELESS"

"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

"‘Crazy’ Bets on $200 Oil Invade the Options MarketTraders are wagering U.S. crude’s rally to a seven-year high is just the beginning, despite a softening global economic expansionThe bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher.PHOTO: LUKE SHARRETT/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Gunjan BanerjiOct. 17, 2021 5:30 am ETA roaring trade in bullish crude-oil options says the 2021 energy rally is far from over.Traders once again are betting that the U.S. oil benchmark will surge above $100 a barrel, from a recent $82, as early as December. U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, is up 10% this month, and 70% this year, but it hasn’t hit $100 since the oil crash of 2014.Wagers across the Atlantic are even more aggressive. Some traders are betting Brent crude, the global benchmark, will hit a record high of $200 a barrel by December 2022, according to data from provider QuikStrike. Options give investors the right to buy or sell at a stated price by a certain date. Traders typically use options to make directional bets or to hedge their portfolios.The bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher, despite a slowing global economic expansion and concerns that higher oil and natural-gas prices will crimp consumer spending. The wagers also show that investors drawn by the small upfront investments and potentially quick payoffs of options trades are piling into energy markets, echoing trades in the stock market this year.$BTE $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG $ATH $CNQ $USO"

"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019.

"This just sucks. Highest oil prices in over 12 months and both CLR and MRO can`t get it up. CLR had a high today of $20.67 and ended at $19.03. Down 64 cents. MRO had a high of $7.72 and ended at $7.38. Up 4cents. Now here is what should make both up. Bakken oil is at $43.50. You say WTI is $54.99 what gives? It cost both $11 a barrel by pipeline so $11+ $43.50 is $54.50. Eagles Ford oil just hit a high of $52.66 and Oklahoma oil is at $51.25 along with Permian oil at $51.25. AS you can see Both stocks should be up on this news. CLR biggest producing basin is Bakkens and so is MRO. I see a problem with cash for CLR but MRO has over $1 billion in cash. Then there are the shorts. Your float short interest is 27.03 and ours is 7.03. You have 17,040,000 shorts and MRO has 55,270,000 shorts. You see MRO should be $12 already buy it can`t because shorts are increasing at MRO. You report 4th quarter on the 16th. MRO on the 17th. Now if CLR has break even cost the same as MRO CLR should go up. MRO shows break even at $35 but I think both CLR and MRO have break even in the Bakkens much lower . If so should we not see a pop on both? Good luck to all . Just wanted to pop over and see our neighbor. Be interesting to see how much free cash flow you made and how much MRO made because with oil up if there is not loads of free cash someone has a problem. I know MRO will have more free cash than 3rd quarter but I will wait to see if CLR does too."

"Buyback time!Low volume manipulation, so glad CLR has buyback in place to counter #$%$ shorts and their BS. Why I enjoy owning these shares so much.Mr. Hamm please continue or increase buybacks with FCF so CLR shareholders are buffered from this kind of trading."
Why is this not in 60s by now
"Seems like Wall Street struggles with math. If CLR is generating $700M a quarter in FCF, their revenue in a year is roughly equal to the float time (60 million shares times $50/share). That is one year and at mid $60s of WTI oil.This can’t be too difficult to discern how grossly undervalued the current stock price is presently. The company is rapidly paying off debt and at this pace will be debt free, if they want. Why would they when their debt is financed in outyears at low rate. Just buy back the Float and stick it to these manipulating bums."

Which makes the big sell off from the high of 11th to the 15th make more sense. I am expecting they sold little more after the 15th but the really big short sell was in that week. Which scared alot of recent buyers and confused alot of people. Great to see an answer for the recent selling even with the positives. Shorts picked a good time to short with oil storage reports taking a step back and scared recent buyers to sell to stop their loses. But back up we go maybe hitting $60 next week after earnings. And when the shorts end need to cover their positions I am not sure where this stock will be. Fundamentally it should be trading between its precovid prices of $55-$65. But with a quick short squeeze I could see $90 till they complete their cover buy back."

"You have to be smoking crack to sell now, September 2018, $70.23 with CLR about $70, we are going higher, much higher once they take out the July 40's, rest certain!!!!"
Not sure if the past dip was just fears on broader market and fed. I think it was just funds taking out some money and waiting to see the market as a whole rather than CLR. Would have thought $34 become the floor while it bounced around to low $40s. Nothing pushing it higher til whole market clearer and next earnings. So it'll bounce around for a while.

"Love this assessment, let’s bust these shorts!!! Continental Resources now expects more than twice as much free cash flow this year than its previous view, on higher oil and gas prices. Continental typically doesn't use oil hedges to lock in prices for a large portion of its oil production like many peers, meaning it was mostly exposed to the upside of the recent price jump. Continental expects to generate $2.4B in free cash flow this year, up from previous guidance of around $1B, and it posted the best quarterly results since summer 2018. But there's no signs Continental will boost pumping or raise capital spending, as shale drillers have done in prior oil recoveries. Instead, it will work on its balance sheet by holding more cash that could be used to pay off debt and resume a $1B share repurchase program suspended during the pandemic. Shares rise 2.4% after hours."

Just wanted to touch on one thing tallshipmaker highlighted. Go to your 3rd quarter 2020 results. Look at average prices and now look at prices I gave you. 4th quarter prices were higher than 3rd quarter. Now this is what you need to focus on. MRO had breakeven at $35 in 3rd quarter at wellhead. They have DUC wells not completed to cut cost. Some of the lowest in history of Marathon. Lateral feet in the Bakkens was at $560 and $700 in Eagles Ford. I believe real cost for both is around $30 dollars in Bakkens. The reason I bring this up say MRO had a average of $45 in 4th quarter all 4 big oil basins and IG. Every dollar over $35 is $55 million so 10 x$55 million is $550 million. Get it lower and the more free cash flow you get. See every thing below $35 pays the bills at CLR and MRO. When I was doing research on CLR when there was talk about both merging I came upon research that showed CLR cost in the Bakkens was more like $30. You see I look at all those permits in the Bakkens. Another factor for 4th quarter is during that time the Dakota access cut rates to help oil companies. It also may have added a little to the bottom line.Yes CLR and MRO will have a loss but I bet it will be better than 3rd quarter. Both should have a loss for the year but if the price of oil stays up all year both CLR and MRO will not have a loss. Then that brings up taxes. Tax laws were changed in March where oil companies could go back 5 years to match the roll back on corporation rates in those years. That means when CLR and MRO both get a refund in July 2020 it will be bigger than last year. In conclusion we need to push to finish the keystone XL from South Dakota down to Texas. I hear the pipe is in the ground around South Dakota. No need to write off all that pipe going to Canada. Canada already has enough pipeline capacity to ship or will have with Enbridge pipeline increases in the Great lakes. Also big pipeline in Vancouver where we Tanker it to the US. We get a lot of oil from Canada. I would say give or take 4.7 million barrels a day and 9.5 million barrels a day from OPEC. ( Never were we energy independent) .Yes we could be. One all refiners in the US should be taxed till they retooled from Sour crude to Sweet crude. Second we need oil companies to buy coal mines. At one time South Africa got 27 percent of there oil from coal. We have more coal in Alaska than the world has oil. 4 basins with 4 trillion tons. So my friends when you tell folks you invest in oil tell them CLR is into green energy because the Bakkens has green oil. (Really) Makes great gasoline and Diesel but with another pipeline south both CLR and MRO could cut cost and make more money.
"Can’t wait for oil to hit $60 and these greedy shorts to be sitting on 30% short position. Good luck buying back 16.35M shares in 60 M share float. Their time is coming and soon and I am not selling one shares. In fact, doing my best to accumulate and take shares away from float."

The price should explode on quarterly earning when people realize that this company is the only one without oil hedges. Most oil companies losing money with locked in hedges. CLR gains as price goes up.
