"CLR has always been the most manipulated of all of my oil stocks... it’s my opinion that the blatantness of the hedge funds and institutions ultimately lead CLR management team to start buybacks to protect shareholders.In any event, as long as the company performs, it won’t matter because there are 11Million shares that need to be purchased on the open market by shorts just to get back to even. - CLR earnings blowouts and growing quarterly FCF - focused effort to reduce debt - increased dividend - Oil increasing in value - shorts taking their short positions deeper daily in lieu of covering to try to hold down the share priceThis can’t end well for shorts.... but as a shareholder, I am extremely pleased with how exceptionally well CLR is executing. I use the dips to add to my already large position.PRICELESS"
$80 is my Goal. CLR needs to dip to take off... look at the moving average at any timed chart.

Loaded up under $50. I was waiting for the over reactors to start selling.
The price should explode on quarterly earning when people realize that this company is the only one without oil hedges. Most oil companies losing money with locked in hedges. CLR gains as price goes up.

"‘Crazy’ Bets on $200 Oil Invade the Options MarketTraders are wagering U.S. crude’s rally to a seven-year high is just the beginning, despite a softening global economic expansionThe bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher.PHOTO: LUKE SHARRETT/BLOOMBERG NEWSBy Gunjan BanerjiOct. 17, 2021 5:30 am ETA roaring trade in bullish crude-oil options says the 2021 energy rally is far from over.Traders once again are betting that the U.S. oil benchmark will surge above $100 a barrel, from a recent $82, as early as December. U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, is up 10% this month, and 70% this year, but it hasn’t hit $100 since the oil crash of 2014.Wagers across the Atlantic are even more aggressive. Some traders are betting Brent crude, the global benchmark, will hit a record high of $200 a barrel by December 2022, according to data from provider QuikStrike. Options give investors the right to buy or sell at a stated price by a certain date. Traders typically use options to make directional bets or to hedge their portfolios.The bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply-chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher, despite a slowing global economic expansion and concerns that higher oil and natural-gas prices will crimp consumer spending. The wagers also show that investors drawn by the small upfront investments and potentially quick payoffs of options trades are piling into energy markets, echoing trades in the stock market this year.$BTE $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG $ATH $CNQ $USO"

I may be wrong but seems like the company operating cash flow is almost the same from the first quarter. Which has me a little confused. However the free cashflow before taking out that capital expenditure was huge. Wish I knew what that $384 million was spent on. I don't think they bought or added anymore wells or drilling projects. Anyone have any idea?

"Shorts remind me of guy walking down the road carrying gas can.

Buy back time; reduce the float!!!The shorts seem content to sit in their 11M shares hole they dug for themselves.
"When did the price target get bumped to $50 from $46. Something is going on. Everything reported is either increasing price targets or mantaining, with everyone being bullish to neutral. Yet something is happening. I know end of the year gets quiet and all the market focuses on consumer goods for the holidays. But if the shorts are not the ones increasing their positions then who is selling and why? I am out of cash so I am out. But I can't find any play better than the oil play right now. Guess next week would answer alot of questions of the earnings and updated short interest numbers."
"Bwahahahaha ... the shorts have still not covered. The ‘fake coverage’ from their rag advisors is hilarious. The company keeps buying shares back, oil continues to rise, and earnings is approaching! Buying more!!!PRICELESS"
"Finally short interest data. From 9/30 to 10/15 the shorts increased there position another 300,000 shares to increase short to just under 17%. Which makes the big sell off from the high of 11th to the 15th make more sense. I am expecting they sold little more after the 15th but the really big short sell was in that week. Which scared alot of recent buyers and confused alot of people. Great to see an answer for the recent selling even with the positives. Shorts picked a good time to short with oil storage reports taking a step back and scared recent buyers to sell to stop their loses. But back up we go maybe hitting $60 next week after earnings. And when the shorts end need to cover their positions I am not sure where this stock will be. Fundamentally it should be trading between its precovid prices of $55-$65. But with a quick short squeeze I could see $90 till they complete their cover buy back."

"Could shorts be actually shorting more before earnings? I know they decreased their positions some from mid september to the end of september but could they really be increasing it now. Just seems like someone is trying to push price down, but it keeps bouncing from lower low. Maybe not enough new money or hedges are waiting and seeing til earnings before buying anymore at this price. Had a good run up and probably stick around this $48-$54 price for the next couple of weeks til earnings and more oil data."
