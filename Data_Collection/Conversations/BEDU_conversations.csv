Folks. This board is pretty quite for an active and upward moving company. If anyone see this. be warned. I just bot a few sys (200) today and that could couse trouble since often when I got things turn south. I just discovered China Education stocks recently and have gotten into TAL and now BEDU.Their PEs are high. but they may be growing enough to support them. Any one following things like these and any other thoughts?

"Agreed! By default, Chinese people put kids education ahead of many other things, to the extent they can sell their houses, borrow out three generations of savings just to send kids to the best school they have get them in. The market is quite appealing. I have high hopes to this institute as well. Just look at how many Chinese students are in all the English speaking countries or in US alone! Many of those students live off their parents and grandparents life savings. Not all of them live off the corrupt money made by those widely reported government officials! Good luck!"
