"Im still on that libya trip. Investor day news on libya potentially? Twitter source for updates on harouge (our working interest company in libya)Within strategic plan for #Harouge company to increase production rates for #Amal field , a team from Engineering Department worked to maintain production well B-065 and convert it from a production well by gas lift to a well produced by a submersible pump. Initial test results are very promising and indicate a significant increase in well productivity. This program comes within a group of 10 wells that are being prepared for maintenance during this period."
