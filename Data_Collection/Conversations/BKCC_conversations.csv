Good earnings report...plus a 10 cent dividend.
"Just received a proxy to vote for a proposal that would allow BKCC to sell shares at ""a price below the Company’s then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings."" Can someone explain why I would want to vote for this?"
"The investment is on non-accrual status as of March 31, 2021 and therefore non-income producing. At March 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value and amortized cost of the Company’s debt andpreferred stock investments on non-accrual status represents 5.50% and 16.51%, respectively.D to E - 43%, so 16.51% loan loss hit on equity would be 23.6%, adjusted BV per share at 3.78...... this price is too expense"
"6/21/2019 Running for Covers?Since the FOMC meeting ended on this past Wednesday and the market was now one hundred per cent sure (really?) that there would be a Fed rate cut (of probably 0.5%) next month, the market had become exuberant and all three major indexes been raining sharply with S&P500 making new high at 2958 yesterday. Even the Iran crisis could not slow down such excitement. Trump canceled the strikes at Iran last minute or the market would certainly crash today. Interesting, I had bought a tone of gold mining stocks and oil refinery/oil stocks and they all went up 5-15% this week. Yet all my shorts (2x and 3x) continued to sink. That is simply interesting. While all three major indexes appeared to have nowhere to go but UP, the Russell 2000 (RUT) did not appear to be able to keep up, after reaching its 12-mo high of 1742 on 8/31/18, it peaked yesterday at 1571 but dropping to today's current 1548. That means small cap stocks did not actively participate in this recent market rally. Since most BDCs are small or even micro-cap stocks and with a stagnant and continuing rate-cut environment, I am having troubles in believing that the earnings of most BDCs will rise and sooner or later, many of them would have to either reduce their dividends, or paying part of their dividends as ROC (return of capital) which will reduce the NAV of its shares. They may also have to offer new shares to raise captial to maintain their earnings, especially for those BDCs that are now selling above their NAVs, that is almost a MUST.Now my smart friend who is a BDC guru disagreed with me on the impact of a rate cut on BDCs. He believes rate cuts are good for BDCs and he said he now holds tons of BDCs plus a ton of shorts (DXD, QID, TWM, etc.)I am not telling you what you should do with your money because the bull market can definitely continue, especially with continued Fed rate cuts by our Fed and if there are QEs with more easy money. But it will not hurt for you to take a deeper look at all of your holdings, especially any of your stocks/funds that would pay high dividends and sell with a high premium. There is simply no FREE lunch in life and when it is too good to be true.....I am trying to buy some BKCC at below $6.....GLTA J"

So far with this stock I have had three dividend payments and this stock seems to be holding up quite well. It has not fell as others have suggested it would.

BKCC has paid $.40/share for several years. This should be a $10 to $12 stock based on the dividend.
if I buy today will I get div. ?
"Even with the reduced dividend, this should be a $10+ stock."
"I got div today, but only about $.03/share. Will they pay the rest sometime later?"
"Most stocks have recovered from the steep selloff in March, this one hasn't, does any of you know why?"
Kept adding as it kept dropping 100 shares at a time. Let's see if I can add some more @ 3.93 before earnings report in August.
"If this closes below the low of 5.49 on the 5th, will it go all the way back to 2.37 to 2.39 lows from 2009?"
"As long as they pay a dividend I will keep my 6,000 shares. And they alway pay a very good dividend. GLTALs"
"hmmm.. NOT happy about the dividend reduction! Once they get there stuff in order, I hope they return to the original dividend!"
BKCC is up 5.10% to 5.77
"Alright, I added to my position today... I'm set for the year, unless something really makes it move way down again. Glta!"

The problem with this firm is that it was heavily leveraged to the oil and energy industry before the total collapse in energy prices in 2015. They are still working through the wreckage of the energy and commodities collapse. A bet on this BDC is a bet that Blackrock with be able to clear out the garbage from the portfolio and replace it with better performing assets. Unfortunately working through the problem investments and running off the non performing assets takes a long time and strong execution. If you buy this you need to buy it with the understanding that this a high risk/reward gamble
