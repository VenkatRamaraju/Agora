Ok we got a decent report. And a .14 dividend. Cool. Been adding while it's been under $5. Hope you are adding to your positions as well.
So far with this stock I have had three dividend payments and this stock seems to be holding up quite well. It has not fell as others have suggested it would.
Good morning I'm new to bkcc. has it been paying out dividends? Thanks
"Looks like a hedger has decided to short the devil out of this. No restriction so they can short it right out of business.The company itself doesn't communicate with anybody. If you send them an email with a question, don't expect an answer.Anonymous probably a paid shill to talk it down."
"Hello:New here.. does this closed end fund offer RO ( rights offering) A rights offering is a group of rights offered to existing shareholders to purchase additional stock shares, known as subscription warrants, in proportion to their existing holdings.They actually OPEN the fund and sell additional shares which ends up diluting the existing shares. I was caught by supprise with CLM/CRF shares. The share price drops to around NAV price and wobbles for a month until the new shares are added. I think somewhere n the process u get a free bottle of snake oil?Does this issue do this RO ritual?? thx ..z"

This pathetic loser has lost half of its share value over the last 4 years. I am not a fan at all.
Some good moves by the company in the past weeks. Several assets monetized reducing debt by a good amount. Should reflect in the earnings soon.

It's hard to believe that the highly revered BlackRock name is attached to this dud.
"Business Development Companies (BDC's) like this one are structured to be beneficial to the managers...not the share holders. I have held BKCC for a long time. Anyone who says they got good returns from BKCC is not being truthful. I'm selling tomorrow, I'll never buy a BDC again."

"I also have big loss , but love the div. Nobody likes paper losses . Brought at 10 4 years ago just my luck ."
"There is no resistance to $12 , this can go up huge $$"
Any news on when this company plans to pay the current dividend ? First it was 3/31 - then 4/3. Today i 4/5 and it still hasn't shown up in my account. They didn't pay last quarter on time either. What is going on ?.
BKCC reached a 52 Week low at 3.94
Dividend of .10 again. The 20%/80% cash/shares again.
"years ago I had this stock and it stayed around $6 a share. sold it for a little profit but had it mainly for dividends. looking at the last 10 years or so, it's only gone down. considering who BlackRock is, could someone tell me why this stock only appears to be dying."
Anyone else waiting for the dividend to show up in their account ? I was supposed to be paid on 7/3. Today is 7/7. This is the 3rd quarter it hasn't shown up when they said it would. Anyone have any BKCC problems they would like to share ?

I jumped into this at $3.90 in a very big way and find it strange that there is very little chatter--Going in the right direction and hope to be in for the long haul--

Made a new 5-year low today.
The problem with this firm is that it was heavily leveraged to the oil and energy industry before the total collapse in energy prices in 2015. They are still working through the wreckage of the energy and commodities collapse. A bet on this BDC is a bet that Blackrock with be able to clear out the garbage from the portfolio and replace it with better performing assets. Unfortunately working through the problem investments and running off the non performing assets takes a long time and strong execution. If you buy this you need to buy it with the understanding that this a high risk/reward gamble

Anyone notice they are paying this next dividend one week later than historically? Is this to increase cash available since they are so close to paying out FCF?
"Have to go somewhere else to get info on this poc. Nothing of value shown here. No bv, no short interest, ..........nothing!"

Expecting a drop today and through tomorrow as 6/15 is ex- dividend- BKCC still seems to have a positive forward rating by most analysis from what little that's available to read- Love to have some thoughts from those who have been in the game a while- Thanks in advance
"If you own shares in this BDC, its a #$%$ shoot wether to buy a bit more here to lower your costs (like I'm doing) or to just say that this is a dog and take your tax loss and move on. its a high risk/potential high reward gamble that blackrock will turn it around"

if I buy today will I get div. ?
RIDICULOUS !
The dividend was cut yet the price is up almost 4%. I am not sure why this is. Any explanations?

Kept adding as it kept dropping 100 shares at a time. Let's see if I can add some more @ 3.93 before earnings report in August.
I received from TD Ameritrade a proxy vote notification. BKCC wants to sell common stock below current NAV. I am typically against this. Any reason to vote for it?
Did I miss the news????
Hey did you see the special meeting vote? I'm thinking more shares is not a good thing. Anyone else?
"Just received a proxy to vote for a proposal that would allow BKCC to sell shares at ""a price below the Company’s then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings."" Can someone explain why I would want to vote for this?"

They had some interesting insights about BKCC on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Earnings report coming out August 5th and I bet it beats predictions.
BlackRock Capital is down 7.44% to 2.42
I would not touch this poorly run trash. It has lost half of its value over the past 4 years
With companies needing funding because of the pandemic we should do better then predicted in the earnings report...
All BDC’s are up today.
Good earnings report...plus a 10 cent dividend.
"6/21/2019 Running for Covers?Since the FOMC meeting ended on this past Wednesday and the market was now one hundred per cent sure (really?) that there would be a Fed rate cut (of probably 0.5%) next month, the market had become exuberant and all three major indexes been raining sharply with S&P500 making new high at 2958 yesterday. Even the Iran crisis could not slow down such excitement. Trump canceled the strikes at Iran last minute or the market would certainly crash today. Interesting, I had bought a tone of gold mining stocks and oil refinery/oil stocks and they all went up 5-15% this week. Yet all my shorts (2x and 3x) continued to sink. That is simply interesting. While all three major indexes appeared to have nowhere to go but UP, the Russell 2000 (RUT) did not appear to be able to keep up, after reaching its 12-mo high of 1742 on 8/31/18, it peaked yesterday at 1571 but dropping to today's current 1548. That means small cap stocks did not actively participate in this recent market rally. Since most BDCs are small or even micro-cap stocks and with a stagnant and continuing rate-cut environment, I am having troubles in believing that the earnings of most BDCs will rise and sooner or later, many of them would have to either reduce their dividends, or paying part of their dividends as ROC (return of capital) which will reduce the NAV of its shares. They may also have to offer new shares to raise captial to maintain their earnings, especially for those BDCs that are now selling above their NAVs, that is almost a MUST.Now my smart friend who is a BDC guru disagreed with me on the impact of a rate cut on BDCs. He believes rate cuts are good for BDCs and he said he now holds tons of BDCs plus a ton of shorts (DXD, QID, TWM, etc.)I am not telling you what you should do with your money because the bull market can definitely continue, especially with continued Fed rate cuts by our Fed and if there are QEs with more easy money. But it will not hurt for you to take a deeper look at all of your holdings, especially any of your stocks/funds that would pay high dividends and sell with a high premium. There is simply no FREE lunch in life and when it is too good to be true.....I am trying to buy some BKCC at below $6.....GLTA J"
