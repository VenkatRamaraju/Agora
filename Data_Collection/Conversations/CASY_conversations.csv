"On November 26, 2019, Argus Research gave a target price of $194.00. I’m glad I don’t pay for their service! LOL"
What's gonna happen when the cars all go to electric? Gasoline sales is clearly a large in-store traffic determinant. This can't be ignored.
wait just a minute. Casey's beat earnings estimates by 29cents and is expanding to build or acquire 60 plus more stores and the stock is getting throttled. Anyone have ideas
"They sell all essential items, gas, Booz, cigarettes, convenience items, fast food, fifth largest pizza seller in the US. It’s all good!"
"New coffee machines serving up an excellent cup of coffee in a wide variety of flavors should help increase volume to stores as word gets around. I used to grab a cup at McDonalds on my way to work, but now I go an extra two block out of my way to get it at Casey's. Might add a small position to my portfolio too. Like investing in companies I use IRL."
What is managements plan for the widespread adoption of EV's ?
I love this Stock....$180 by end of the month. Solid Earnings lets go
"Why has cast stock moved so much the past two days ? Volume doesn’t reflect such a move , could there be a take over story out there???"
"Casey's remains on track with its value creation plan to improve sales and profitability. This includes new fleet card program, price and product optimization, loyalty program, digital engagements comprising mobile app and online ordering capabilities, cost containment efforts as well as capital reallocation plan. Management is also focusing on improving distribution efficiency. Casey’s cost-reduction initiatives are likely to result in savings of approximately $200 million in store-level operating expenditures by fiscal 2021.As a part of the fuel product optimization plan the company has converted 592 stores to biodiesel and 144 stores to premium or diesel. The company launched the new Caseys.com e-commerce website, initiated fuel price optimization platform across all outlets and will soon launch enhanced mobile app. At the end of fiscal 2019, the new fleet card program has more than 2,000 active cards and 500 new accounts. We note that shares of Casey's have increased 47% in a year compared with the industry that advanced 43.4%."
What happens to Casey’s when all the cars in cities and on highways are electric?
why is this dropping? Any thoughts?
Kwik Trip chain in Midwest needs to go public. They are 10 times better than Casey's.
caseys is always packed. PACKED! business model is great. ive noticed the new rewards system rewards more points if you buy caseys name products. I'm totally comfortable buying Caseys at this lvl. I expect major earnings jmo.
"I'll tell you right now. Casey's in my town is always packed. all their food (pizza, donuts, chicken tenders, and their small subs stations) is great and reasonably priced. as far as their gas sales going down. I dont believe that effects their business as much as this last drop has entailed. the valuation of this stock isnt even a 1. I'll be buying at these levels as long as they last."
"CASY Earnings today, after the bell? Thoughts? Not much interest on this board. Volume for today is only 130K, with average daily volume only with average volume of 305K or so. I say it sells off on earnings. Looks overbought within a 3 year down trend. High was back in July, 2016. Heading back down to $90 area. Trump China tariffs will hurt, if they sell a lot of Chinese made goods, and what store doesn't these days. The American public has gotten used to Made in China over the last 20 years to make our paychecks stretch further."
"I just rode a across the country stopping at many Casey's. They were all clean, well stocked, and generally very busy. Friendly, helpful employees too. I don't know about the stock but management is getting it done with the product."
I recently moved to the Midwest from New York what I like about Casey’s was that parking lot were always full and the Casey’s in my town in Northwest Missouri actually put out of business the Pizza Hut and is right next-door to the subway who’s parking lot is always empty ... The week after I got out here the earnings came out the stock droped... and now I’m am in ..
One minute people are whining that there isn't enough money coming from fuel sales and now apparently a higher price for oil and fuel and thus greater revenue is threat to the business? Seems irrational given the fact that they had record earnings and great revenue. I thought it went down because revenues from fuel were less than desired? So what is it this time? Too much revenue to come from fuel sales now? Much like a scam now adays...
"Berkshire is becoming a majority owner of Pilot Travel Centers. I always thought Berkshire should buy Casey's, but probably too late at this point."
market is down but CASY is holding well... also the volume is going higher! I expect 170-175 open tomorrow...
