"I will say this though. I forgot about the buybacks. Once this drops 5% they Will buy back shares price will end flat. Same thing Dillard’s did. That earnings report was awful, and once it dropped, old Dillard’s bought a ton of shares to push price back up"
Why the jump late Friday? I don't see any news...
Stock is up but wish it was a little more

He’s trying to sugar coat which always brings on a red dayCEO update: ""Quarterly results were positively impacted by our fuel price optimization initiative, store growth, and a continued focus on controlling operating expenses...

"New coffee machines serving up an excellent cup of coffee in a wide variety of flavors should help increase volume to stores as word gets around. I used to grab a cup at McDonalds on my way to work, but now I go an extra two block out of my way to get it at Casey's. Might add a small position to my portfolio too. Like investing in companies I use IRL."

"Casey's remains on track with its value creation plan to improve sales and profitability. This includes new fleet card program, price and product optimization, loyalty program, digital engagements comprising mobile app and online ordering capabilities, cost containment efforts as well as capital reallocation plan. Management is also focusing on improving distribution efficiency. Casey’s cost-reduction initiatives are likely to result in savings of approximately $200 million in store-level operating expenditures by fiscal 2021.As a part of the fuel product optimization plan the company has converted 592 stores to biodiesel and 144 stores to premium or diesel. The company launched the new Caseys.com e-commerce website, initiated fuel price optimization platform across all outlets and will soon launch enhanced mobile app. At the end of fiscal 2019, the new fleet card program has more than 2,000 active cards and 500 new accounts. We note that shares of Casey's have increased 47% in a year compared with the industry that advanced 43.4%."
"Glancing at this only because it was listed as a Zacks category 1 stock a few weeks ago and its still holding there. Whenever possible it's nice to have personal experience with a stock's business - i..e. - it's hard not to notice that the Walmart and Kohls parking lots in my town are always jam packed. Casey's became news in my area a little over a year ago when they wanted to open up a new location directly across the street from a strong Mobil mart - in a puny town (Darien, WI). Seemed like a poor waste of capital to me. Then, they bougtht a very weak gas station that had been hit hard a year earlier by the station slayer in the area - Quik Trip. The store they bought is a block away. They've spent some money remodeling it but it still apears dead. The crazy part is that Caseys already had a dead station a half-mile away - albeit on a different street. I don't think I've seen many gas stations as dead as that one - it's just on the wrong street as a Speedway a few blocks away is jammed 24/7. So, it looks like Caseys has come into some expansion money but in my small little corner of the world they're not investing that money wisely. That's just enough for me to not have any desire to get into this stock."
What is wrong with Casey's General Stores. It should be going up up and away.
OUCH!!!!
"When they say on the conference call ""aquire new stores"" are they talking about buying out another convenience store and converting to a caseys?"
Casey’s new automated fuel pricing program is taking their fuel margin down quickly. This will show up in a hit to earnings. I think they were sold a pipedream of software.
CASY is down 4.91% to 166.31
"Store expansions are good, renovations are nice, price optimization and margin year over year increases all bode well for CASY. Now its time to start raising the dividend for shareholders as profits increase."

Manipulators must have ran this up on solid quarters. Now want their quick profits. Someone explain how continued solid growth deserves a crash like this. Maybe their still using plastic straws and selling real meat.
CASY reached a new 52 Week High at 129.83
I recently moved to the Midwest from New York what I like about Casey’s was that parking lot were always full and the Casey’s in my town in Northwest Missouri actually put out of business the Pizza Hut and is right next-door to the subway who’s parking lot is always empty ... The week after I got out here the earnings came out the stock droped... and now I’m am in ..
can we get to 135 that's a decent entry point
CASY is down -5.02% to 101.67
"They sell all essential items, gas, Booz, cigarettes, convenience items, fast food, fifth largest pizza seller in the US. It’s all good!"
Big corporations monopoly it’s sad Small business are slowly disappearing Specially in small towns where it’s a tax haven for big corporations And the Governments and Mayors don’t care anymore No regulations period. Some town don’t even have the populations to support but some how this big corporations are thriving:)
"Brian Rogers Rogers:My third name is Casey’s General Stores [CASY], not my usual cup of tea. The company has 40 million shares outstanding and a market value of roughly $4.5 billion. The stock is trading for $116 a share. Casey’s is based in Iowa and occupies an interesting niche. It runs convenience stores and gas stations in the Midwest, and roughly half its stores are in towns with fewer than 5,000 people. It effectively has a competitive moat because no one else is going to enter these markets. The company has 1,940 stores; it owns 99%, and its best business, interestingly, is pizza delivery.Casey’s isn’t a value-based investment; it is a growth-oriented company. It is planning to expand into small towns in states including Ohio, Kansas, Tennessee, and Arkansas. It builds new stores or makes bolt-on acquisitions. It buys stores it can remodel. It is adding 60 to 70 new stores a year. Casey’s could earn $5.71 a share in fiscal 2017, ending in April, and $6.50 in fiscal 2018. It is inexpensive, as retailers go, but with a clear growth trajectory.Gabelli: About seven years ago Canada’s Couche-Tard tried to buy Casey’s for $38.50 a share. 7-Eleven came along and offered $43. Management said no to both, and the stock has tripled since.Rogers: This is a good niche operation with high returns."
I want to buy in but I’m nervous....
I love this Stock....$180 by end of the month. Solid Earnings lets go
"Looks like good results, just like last quarter, when released on 12/9/2018. I looked at the trending from that time. The adjusted closing price the market day (12/7/2018) before the release was 121.21. The subsequent adjusted closing prices the next three days were 12/10 - 119.41, 12/11 - 129.17, and 12/12 - 135.40. This action from a previous moderate beat in earnings tells me that there will be some volatility, so you might want to hang on to this stock if it is/was a trade for you, and you might be rewarded for at least a couple of days of being patient, if history (or trends) repeat themselves."
"The price will drop to under $100, and I added 20 more put at $105. Easy Money"

Casey’s is only store in towns and summer is coming which brings campers looks good
Casey's General Stores is down 9.94% to 146.03
Oh man followed ULTIMAT STCK ALRT (check them out) and they are great .
Looking good CASY just stay with it and keep growing. It's looking good hope it cont. to grow.
One minute people are whining that there isn't enough money coming from fuel sales and now apparently a higher price for oil and fuel and thus greater revenue is threat to the business? Seems irrational given the fact that they had record earnings and great revenue. I thought it went down because revenues from fuel were less than desired? So what is it this time? Too much revenue to come from fuel sales now? Much like a scam now adays...
"Here are some problems:1) Acquisitions are no longer easy and cheap to come by.2) expansion thru de novo stores have a lower ROI3) If CASY has five stores in a county, and three already deliver pizza and are open 24/7, these three were selected as the juiciest opportunities. The last two stores will not have as much impact4) after a store goes 24/7, that is the limit that store can expand that way.5) Casey has done a great job and made tough business look easy. See TA (TravelCenters of America) to see what can go wring."
"hehe..the parking lot is full because in rural America that is ""town"", and that's where they go to sell their meth.....lol"
Kwik Trip chain in Midwest needs to go public. They are 10 times better than Casey's.

"Red for no reason, expect great earnings"
@Bryan......No I don't think so. I have a self sufficient farm with 400 acres. All the meat I want to butcher. All the fruit I can handle and can. And a 5 acre vegetable garden with plenty of canning that's ben done. And a bible that's leading me to the promised land. Can't say I need much of anything from town especially from any big city like Chicago that's full ignorance and sin
"wow, what a great day!!!!"
"I guess you pretty much have to listen to the earnings conference call tomorrow morning. I suspect that cold weather will have been a big reason for the revenue miss. So, nothing controllable specific to CASY."
"If the 3 day theory holds, should see the start of some uptick. Green will look good on CASY."
"got in today, I have wanted part of this for years! very long holder."

"CASY Earnings today, after the bell? Thoughts? Not much interest on this board. Volume for today is only 130K, with average daily volume only with average volume of 305K or so. I say it sells off on earnings. Looks overbought within a 3 year down trend. High was back in July, 2016. Heading back down to $90 area. Trump China tariffs will hurt, if they sell a lot of Chinese made goods, and what store doesn't these days. The American public has gotten used to Made in China over the last 20 years to make our paychecks stretch further."

"Found it online. Yahoo boosted this articlereports same-store sales were up 3.2% in Q2 for the grocery business during the quarter with average margin of 31.3%. The company says average margin was adversely impacted by a $6.6M out-of-period inventory adjustment, which, if excluded, would have resulted in average margin of 32.3%.Same-store fuel gallons were down 2.0% vs. -1.4% anticipated.Same-store prepared food and fountain sales were up 1.6% vs. +2.9% consensus.Gross margin was 21.5% of sales vs. 21.7% consensus."

wait just a minute. Casey's beat earnings estimates by 29cents and is expanding to build or acquire 60 plus more stores and the stock is getting throttled. Anyone have ideas

"What is this story on Facebook about Casey’s terminating an employee with 29 Years and 11 Months of service?If this is true, I will be shopping at Kwik Star and selling my stock.You don’t do things like that to small town folks. Just plain stupid. It doesn’t take much to open a better store right across the street."
target raised to $142 by Jeffery!
"Great earnings, I will continue to hold long!!!!"
I dont like this decline today right before earnings
"PF charting gives CASY target $210, meaning upside over 70%!"
any reason why CASY is going up despite of not outstanding earnings?
"@ AdamDirectly from earnings recapFor the quarter, average fuel margin was 24.4 cents per gallon, while same-store gallons sold were down 2.0%"
"I just rode a across the country stopping at many Casey's. They were all clean, well stocked, and generally very busy. Friendly, helpful employees too. I don't know about the stock but management is getting it done with the product."
Barrons just published a very bullish article about how they are buying up competitors and it is cheap with upside.
"Kwik Trip is cleaning Casey's clock in Iowa. This is only going to get worse for Casey's. They can't compete with the Kwik Trip business model, the size and layout and functionality of Kwik Trips new stores. Do your research and find out for yourself. Short Casey's.....the stock is over bought and over rated."

"On November 26, 2019, Argus Research gave a target price of $194.00. I’m glad I don’t pay for their service! LOL"
How much do you all think CASY will fall tomorrow?
Where are the comments?
"I am trying to rationalize the drop in the stock after earnings. Earnings were amazing. True, inside sales and margins were somewhat disappointing, but there were store restrictions, and less driving, especially during breakfast hours I imagine, as breakfast sales were hurt the most."
CASY is down 5.69% to 150.25
the earnings will be bad really bad
"Looks to me that CASY still has a lot of rooms for future growth. 110 new stores in the state of Ohio where no store existed before. The 2018 guidance tells me that the fuel margin has hit the trough, along with other items' margins. Putting all together, the stock should have bottomed out already and continue upward with better prospects. $130 near term. $150 next year. JMO"
Daniel....your funny...when bad times hit...those farmers will be in the stores looking for something to eat...
pump it!
"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Fuel sold and prepared food didn’t do good in my opinion .
"I'll tell you right now. Casey's in my town is always packed. all their food (pizza, donuts, chicken tenders, and their small subs stations) is great and reasonably priced. as far as their gas sales going down. I dont believe that effects their business as much as this last drop has entailed. the valuation of this stock isnt even a 1. I'll be buying at these levels as long as they last."
Casey's General Stores is down 4.91% to 166.31
If you sell now you’ll be crying in 10 minutes
"I want to buy options at the end of the day; however, revenue has been increasing but earnings have decreased since last year so I'm not sure. They don't have a lot of debt which in my opinion makes it also somewhat undervalued."
