"i own K, GIS, and CPB ... i will say on historical basis GIS has outperformed K and CPB. Going forward who knows .."
This company is run by America HATING PERVERTS. See their ties to Black Lies Matter and the Soros Tides Center.
My company will NO LONGER be buying any products from Kellogg's due to being a Hillary pimped company
Why has Kellogg's Foundation been selling huge quantities of stock at regular intervals?
$61.00 would be a great entry
When will these companies learn it is bad business to alienate their customers. How foolish.
It’s pretty funny how K and GIS pretty much own most of the products I buy in wegmans from pringles to eggo to progresso and yet the stocks trade at a steep discount to the overall market. 15x earnings. 3+% dividends. Simple inflation protected businesses and yet all anyone wants to do is catch the falling knives in the biotech and tech names. At some point the reopening trades end and if you’re patient today I’d imagine the safety stocks like K and GIS and TR take the baton from the reopening stocks
just bought some cag.
Bought 900 shares @ $57. Great stock for hedging against an inevitable Nasdaq fall.
"Momentum building, finally beginning to outperform. Under $60 won't last much longer, grab your coffee and take a gander at the cup and handle..."
"I wouldn't feed Kelloggs' sugar-laced slop to hogs, anyway."
"Wow, no comments in over two months. That speaks volumes."
"Do not buy Kellogg’s products! They promote hard lefty causes. We refuse to buy any of their products due to their politics. As an aside, why are they so vociferous into politics? Doesn’t make sense."
"I don't own any Kellogg stock yet, but one thing is for sure is that I would definitely put my money here before BYND at this point, especially seeing this is still near its 52 week low."
put volume moving. read up. debt on top of that. lurking for much lower accumulation opening.
What a beautiful stock! Solid dividend 
"Trump will instruct State legislators across the nation to ban ""K"" products in the public school systems in theirdistricts. General Mills and other brands will do just fine. There is no need to endorse a racist Company thatpromotes the lefist lunatic disease of ""identity politics"" and worse, ""Black Supremacism"" as exhibited by ACORNand the BLACK LIES MATTER movement. NO RICE KRISPEES IN THE SCHOOLS!"
Composite operator still aiming to accumulate shares under 60 before the breakout but the volume is struggling... hey buddy... time to give it up...
I’m in for 1000 shares
Hey liberal democrat California voters please tell me how Maxine Waters can buy a $4.3 Million dollar house in Congress women’s salary. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cg-1E2AoE_w
Is it possible for AMD to reach $15.5 next week before Friday? Do you think shorts will f#%^@$^#k us again?
One QUARTER MILLION have now signed the petition to NEVER buy Kellog products again. Add your name at Breitbar.
GP Investments upgrades Kellogg to Strong Buy
I understand Kellogg's workers are now on strike. Good! I will never forgive the company for discontinuing Product 19!
"Congrats Kellogg. You now join Target, Starbucks and Macys in my 'Do Not Buy' list."
"I actually intended to buy shares of K. Whew. Dodged that bullet. GIS is the one to own.Plus, I don't want politics for breakfast. I don't want my food produced by rabid activists of any party."
"120k have signed the Breitbart petition. How much do those people spend $50/yr, $100/yr on Kelloggs products. How much have the dimwitted management cost Kelloggs shareholders?"
Time to go long on Tony the Tiger shelf stock before the supply is depleted. Should be great for q4 sales.
"If I were a union leader and wanted assert control on how my members we paid, I would own alot of shares in the company. I would direct my members to buy shares in the company….but then I would actually have to consider the ramifications of a strike….my dividends… my initial investment. Hmmm guess thats why unions leaders invest in companies that have no unions….lol"
It's really nice to see Kellogg employees urinating in cereal as well. Combine this incident with the company jumping into politics the CEO needs to go.
"I guess this is what makes Chris a MORON....""Chris 3 hours agoCreative Planning manages $24B not $15B. Here is a list of their holdings. https://fintel.io/i/creative-planning If you scroll down about 1/4 of the page you get to $262,000. That mean they have more money in ONP that 3,500 of their 4,800 positions. Also, keep in mind there are 100,000 publicly traded stocks they could buy. That put ONP in the top 1% or 2% of all stock world wide.""https://fintel.io/i/creative-planningChris goes down 1/4 of this page and Chris sees (for example) AAPL (current value) at $338,582 and he thinks that Creative's AAPL position is about the same their ONP position. What Chris doesn't KNOW is that Creative owns 2,356,831 shares of AAPL worth over $338 MILLION. All this blathering IDIOT needs to do is look UP to the TOP of the page (same column) to see CURRENT VALUE ($K) that ($K) means THOUSANDS and $338,582,000 is what their AAPL position is. In order to arrive at something similar to ONP's $260K position one needs to scroll FAAAAAR DOWN the page to where there's a $260 position. Yes Creative certainly has a boat load of miniscule positions but as a PERCENTAGE of Creative's TOTAL portfolio, ONP represents almost exactly 0.001% of their TOTAL portfolio, in anybody's books this ONE THOUSANDTHS of ONE PERCENT represents not even a ROUNDING ERROR. To most SANE PEOPLE, Creative's ONP position is TOTALLY INSIGNIFICANT to a company with $24 billion under management."
Time for a change in management!
K stock has only been falling for 5 years. Time to replace the entire board...
"Kellogg Company Declares Regular Dividend of $0.54 per Share and Announces Plans for 4% Dividend Increase. Bullish indication in KDJ and RSI, according to stoxline."
"Moving back to undervalued territory. Will add, GIS likewise"
"Kellogg CEO, John A. Bryant, should be fired and thrown in a bowl of soggy corn flakes."
"Good place to park 1 to 2% of portfolio, 4% yield,"
Buy Buy Buy
The key is that share repurchases are resuming. Even management believe that K is currently under intrinsic value. Do you DD tho pls
"Strong value still exists here, most of the other stocks in this industry are trading at a higher P/E and pay out a lower dividend."
Buy order set for $56. Then add more if it goes below 52
Fun fact: 7x the avg. daily volume is short this stock.
"Most people eat three times a day, Food stocks are a No brainer"
"Huge earnings beat, double digit organic growth, raised full year guidance and stock price is down. What gives? This should be up 4-5%. Much more to come in 2nd half of 2020."
Politics and business do not mix. Boycott Kellogg products. fire the CEO now!
Make a fair deal for all parties involved kelloggs. Do the right thing
Smiling as I watch Kellogg's stock plummet.
When is the next dividend payment?
I’ll gladly buy at this level and get a nice dividend payout in the process.
I in at 57$ I think this is one of the best value stocks to have in portfolio right now
Like opportunity with Morningstar Farms. Like the product refresh of cereal and happy that the dividend increase has resumed. I also am happy that 2020 was such a good year to help solidify the balance sheet. I'll be buying more Kashi today.
"Look at the Five-year chart , this is the safest stock out there and with a 4% dividend I'm all in the earnings could be nice on top of it all. 65-70 by summer."
You gotta be kidding. K is a steal here. I thought Morningstar was private. Bought pre-market. There's a $100B company hiding inside Kellogg.
Managing to lose 9% of shareholder value in 24 hours doesn't exactly indicate good management/ earnings guidance?
I see now Morningstar commercials lately. The contain natural substances while beyond meat contains many never seen chemicals. It taste great.
"Morningstar. See the MarketWatch article by Brett Arends. How can management not be seriously considering an IPO of Morningstar Farms? Why aren't they being inundated by calls from Goldman and other investment bankers to monetize this asset? Where are the hedgie activists? Plenty of adages for them to ponder: Strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates is lost. C'mon guys, just sell 20% of it and put the bucks in the cash register."
"Somewhat off topic here, but obviously people here are investors. I would appreciate your opinions/advice. My brother and I recently inherited an IRA ($80,000) and it is to be divided equally between us. My sister was left off as a beneficiary which I felt was unjust and I want to give her half of the 1/3 I feel she deserves (Approximately $13,333). However, I am going to responsible for state and federal income taxes on the $40,000. My wife and I are in the Federal 22% taxable income bracket and the 6% State income tax bracket. Would I be right in reducing my sister's share by 28% since it appears I have to pay that much in tax on the $40,000? Thank you."
President Trump made me richer again this week with a record January stock market close. Nice 
Political opinions are very expensive to the share holder.
"I sold my call today for a 1 week 33% profit, nice thanks K!"
very good price and divs to keep portfolio diversity
K has solid pricing power. I like this name under 60
Great buy under $60
is special k a legal substance?
First buy today. Vegan products will launch soon.
Possible Morningstar Farms IPO and great dividend will reward patience in a big way. Wait and see
When will K get around to crushing BYND? Morning Star has been making veggie burgers and other meat alternatives for decades.
lol this is my only green
have your cake and keto too - haha I like it! there's some creative juices flowing inside Kellogg this year for sure. A nice set of new product announcements just in January alone. And we'll be seeing a Kellogg's ad in the SuperBowl in Feb 7. This in a year when Pepsi Coke and Bud are all sitting out.
This is my savings account with 3% yield
bought at 57 and sold at 63 .... a bit regretting....
Great buy at this price

"Maybe ""K"" will be moving their headquarters to the Middle East where their corporate values are more aligned with the general population!"
I just bought my first shares of this. Let’s see how it goes
"Kellogg Company (K), 10% Owner, Kellogg Foundation Trust, Filled Form 4, on 04/12/2021, Disposed 83,333 shares, at Price $63.22 worth $5,268,412 Follow On Instagram, https://www.instagram.com/money_insider_stocknews/Facebook, https://www.facebook.com/Earnegy/For Stocks Inside News and Details."
250k former customers not purchasing cereal everyday adds up to nearly half a billion dollars worth of lost revenue. What a stupid business decision it is to involve yourself in politics.
"Nice dividends. Beware, overpaid Michigan workers destroyed the auto industry and cereals are next."
"""Kellogg Company Celebrates Frontline Workers in NYSE Closing Bell Ceremony""Management believes in the fake covid pandemic-hoax. Won't be long before politicians demand they pay their ""heros"" +$5/hr extra hero pay ""until the pandemic is over."""
"Sold my shares in after hours trading today.....I no longer want to support this company through ownership, and I don't think I am alone."
#NEVERKELLOGG - I'm SICK OF bigoted liberal limousine CEO's trying to ram their LEFTIST AGENDA down the throats of AMERICA !
$80.00 value by year end..Many new products and lower debt
"I've had my eye on this as it keeps popping up on some screens I run but it keeps heading south. Consensus undervalued here by $10-$15, low beta, good yield and the only negatives being reported are insider selling - primarily by the Kellogg Trust Foundation at around 83,000 shares at a pop. I'll continue to wait and keep my eye on this until it starts heading back north."
When the shorts want something lower best to move on. How they do it I’ll never understand
Market makes little sense. BYND surges and K with same type of potential plus other significant food revenues and much larger languishes!
"So what I'm gathering is that Kellogg's sold a few of its non-core assets to consolidate and prioritize their growth strategy, which includes capitalizing on growing dietary and lifestyle trends with healthier foods and sustainable farming, while also acquiring businesses in developing economies to target emerging market growth.The dip is a direct result of marginally reduced operating profits from the divestiture and lower short term guidance. They're investing elsewhere in both operating facilities, businesses and product innovation, they're seeing organic sales growth in most geographical regions. They're still a profitable enterprise and making moves to try and secure themselves for the future.Our global population is continuing to grow and we will only have more mouths to feed, I'll take a nibble at this stock when it dips over SHORT TERM outlook and then I will hold it over the LONG TERM for the dividend income.Disclaimer *I'm just an amateur retail investor, don't take my words for financial advice*"
The yahoo algorithm wont let you post facts lots of words will get you the boot not a fact friendly place.
Another company on my long and growing list of companies that think teeing off half the consumer base is a good idea. Good-bye K. Don't need you either.
"Senior VP of R&D announced loads of new products, increasing interest in health and safety, strong focus on plant based"
"I've been adding small amounts , Thinking Defense"
"I sold my entire stake in General Mills and put the proceeds into Kellogg's to consolidate my portfolio into fewer holdings. (I still have PEP, MDLZ, P&G as well in consumser defensives)-earnings beat-organic growthstrategic acquisitions and divestments-Good selection of plant based offerings (morningstar, Kashi, incogmeato)-innovative management-higher dividend yield than general mills-smaller market cap than general mills.Am I crazy?"
"Beyond meat puts out imposter meat products, but Kellogg's had morning star products on shelves for years. I don't get it"
"ex dividend day is tomorrow, .56 for August 31. Volume should pick up today."
this is a slow moving stock
boycott Kellog...
the Coronavirus epidemic has saved Kellogg. Now people see the value in a good box of cereal once again.
"This company is a perfect example of everything that's wrong with the market. It has a PE ratio far better than most of the stocks on fire right now like Tesla, Amazon, and Zoom. They pay more in their dividends too. They have a proven track record during recessions and their current sales is proof that they are killing it again. Yet somehow the stock is stagnant."
Breakout close over $60 coming Thursday. Major rotation into value stocks as the market enters its parabolic phase.
Nice to get two years of dividends in one day!
New CEO time
One day this country may realize that we have one lookout for one another. Too many folks only care about themselves one day your job might be on the line next. Boycott Kelloggs.
honestly it not a sexy stock but it has held up better than most of my portfolio
"New health bar - Roundup and oats ---on sale , also PPB beef , 10 pounds for a dollar--we cant shop at whole foods , so we eat dirt-- Geno-cide of the poor black babies---ROUNDUP in oats -----"
another missed opportunity for K?? Taco Bell announced a deeper partnership with Beyond Meat today. I liked the announcement of the partnership with Dunkin Donuts early last week but... K is moving glacially slow with these partnerships compared with the competition.
We have not bought any Kellogg products since they decided to go political against President Trump.Bad choice people. I vote with my wallet. And I am the shopper in a house of 5.
This stock will reprice higher next week to to the Morningstar (meatless meat) division.
"Need some advice. I am on sidelines like the valuation but drifting lower.....believe next quarter will be home as CPG over delivers but that street may see more sell off as return to normal trade assumes CPG sell off. What to do? Thumbs up = buy, thumbs down = look somewhere else? Wisdom of crowds...."
"Generally speaking people dont want their breakfast cereal to be political. Kelloggs is smack in the middle of pushing a twisted ideology/philosophy that seems to be happy supporting a group that has openly called for the murder of our police force as well as wrongly label consumers of its products racist and ""phobic"" of the ""gender continuum"". The vast majority of current or yesterdays customers don't want to be told by a cereal maker how to define truth and reality... http://www.angrypatriotmovement.com/kelloggs-terror-group/."
"K reports Before mkt opens. expect not much save for tax juggles and other accounting contrivance that i shall not understand. am patient, and will start at 56. you know better, of course."
i'm in for 500 shares today. Great products. Great brand. Opportune market for the year. Div is strong. Keep it rolling.
"YAHOO- You are garbage! First you take away your online games for unknown reasons. Now you F@#$K the finance comments page up, by calling it ""conversations"". No need to come back to you guys anymore. Its garbage!"
I joined the boycott yesterday!
Think I am going to have to short this after Kelloggs stepped in it.
"Go woke, go broke. Those new cereal boxes, smh"
"I love this company...I eat a lot of its products.I like what they're doing to branch out into growing food categories (vegetarian/vegan).I like that they are acquisitioning food companies in emerging markets and divesting from low margin companies.But damn do they have a hard time managing their debt. With such a high divvy (which I also like), they can't meaningfully pay it down and will be perpetually stuck in a cycle of debt servicing and restricted cash flow.In their defense, their restructuring has cost a fair penny but I need to see better results before feeling comfortable returning to this stock. Just look at that awful current ratio..."
have drip since my 7th birthday (was a gift) in 2008. loyal customer then loyal now. I want them to spinoff the plant based segment. We need management to consider this
The Kellogg Foundation has been reducing its holding in this stock for months and that seems to be keeping somewhat of a lid on the upward price movement.
Plant based companies getting ready for a run..Kellogg's big in that sector..Beef prices out of control. Drought..heat etc
Nothing but upward momentum on this stock. Great yield
"5 year chart facts...$82.71 high to current $58.03, decline of $24.68 per share! The 4% yield does not matter when it's a downward trend. The is similar to MO, not a long hold play!"
"Kellogg's is well positioned for the evolving consumer dietary trends with a large variety of plant based offerings, Morningstar, Kashi, etc. etc.. They have shown an ability to innovate and made divestment and acquisitions to target revenue growth as well. Compared to the current valuation of consumer defensive stocks like PEP, MDLZ, PG, etc., I think that Kelloggs is one of the best options to buy right now."
Double bottom here folks
Yea the commodity inflation will drag this down. They better pass on the cost to consumer every 6months and raise divy. Otherwise this willl be sold hard
Is it a good buy here guys?
"June $60 calls volume on fuego today, "
"Kelloggs, Just make cereal and get out of identity politics. It doesn't suit you. But you probably take your marching orders from the Free Masons so no real shocker here."
fat fingers trade? bid/ask is in the $58 range.. no news
What a beautiful stock!
Democrat politicians have promised more viruses and variants and lockdowns from time to time.. just load up on pkg food stocks
Take out coming this year
"Nothing to see here today, v low volumeBack up next weekBought some 60 buck calls at bottom on Tuesday - up nicely so farJust came from KO where I made a nice 30% on calls alsoThis is a steal under 61, regardless of what the sentiment is"
I would sure sell any kellogg stock before their 4th quarter report. The boycott is going hit their earnings big time. I used to buy kellogg's products before I realized they were anti America!
Added more
Bought 3000 shares today.
I haven't bought their products in years. I discovered their foundation contributes millions to left wing groups wanting to destroy capitalism. The company responds by saying they have no control over foundation decisions.
Will never buy a Kellogg product ever agian
"How long till their market cap is down a few billion and CEO forced to resign? With the new video showing man urinating on the cereal production line and identity politics at top levels, this company is headed South IMO. RIP $K"
"*** K is A-OK for a buy ***$52 is 52-week low$52 is 152-week low$52 is 252-week lowSitting at $58, this stock is closest to its low. High at $85 at one point. Dividend steady. Dividend increasing. For 35 Years. Started at 5.5 cents in 1985. Now at 57 cents (3.93% annual return)Yes. This stock won't triple or go 10x like TSLA, ROKU - but in my book, this is one of the safest stocks for steady income plus potential appreciation. It does not have Weekly Options. But Monthly Options offer another 4% annual potential for a safe 8% return. Please add your thoughts - good or bad. Will be appreciated."
"Couldn?t take Kellogg?s woke agenda anymore. Sold all my shares today. Corporations need to stay out of politics for the following good reason: #$%$ off half of your customers is a bad business decision. I choose to own single stocks so that when corporations make business decision blunders, I can fire them at will. This corporation will not merit my investment in the future as long as the current BoDs and CEO are in place."
Breakout close over $60/share coming today!
Silly Kellogg. As a Canadian and regular Breitbart reader I can only say what nonsense. What good does the corp does when it alienates its consumers. I do not own shares in this company but Kellogg will be under tmy radar when I do my grocery shopping. Kellogg CEO should immediately fire the PR imbecile that came up with this nightmare and appologize IMO.
"K & PEP are now in the ""No Buy Zone"". Hasta la vista baby !"
I am a partner in the ownership of a highly respected Summer Camp for boys that's been in extant for decades. I have secured agreement from my fellow owners that we will not buy any cereal products (like we did in the past)for this upcoming Summer season. We will go with other brands. Needless to say we will not be serving this Company's cereal in our homes and we will be encouraging others to boycott the Company as well.We despise the mindset that operates at K. Breitbart News is far more important to me as a reliable sourceof news than CNN or NBC/ABC/CBS/NPR/PBS. I visit Breitbart sometimes 3 times a day - at home and my office.I cannot believe how out-of-touch the leaders of K actually are! They have no clue what is going on! Amazing.
"K is more than cereal, it is Morning Star, Pringles, Eggo, etc. all solid brands and all that will be seeing an increase in sales due to everyone being stuck without schools and restaurants to eat at."
Gorgeous stock
"Funny I bought this know this should happen but wasn’t expecting it would.. what, with all market manipulation and gamification... wish I bought more"
Kellogs stepped on their diycks because of their libterd Breitbart deal.Message to the CEO: Make cereal and stay out of politics!Financially you will suffer due to this stupidity!
"Cheap, good dividend and great future perspectives.. I love this stock"
I bought K in May and it has been doing good. Dividends at 0.91% of price are good too. I will add more on the dips.
"well, you put a price tag on the union demands and turn it over to your CFO. Then you set back and see who gets the hair cut. The company, union workers, stock holders or the consumer and go from there."
it's either a job at fair pay with benefits or no job. Unions are what exported jobs.
Kellogg’s is good. Staying in for good
Should Kellogg's IPO or spin off Morningstar Farms as it's true value is not reflected in Kellogg's market cap and stock price with plant based foods being a niche.
Pepsi has been running lately... I wouldn't be surprised if Kellogg runs next
"Kellogg EPS misses by $0.02, misses on revenue"
Rare chance to load up on beaten iconic companies. K CAG KHC CPB. Wealth is made now if you have patience. Collect the divvy and retire in 10 years. Load up now.
"Boom: Best Economic Optimism in 16 Years, 50% ‘Better Off’ Under Trump-Washington Examiner“Public optimism in their personal economy has hit a 16-year high under President Trump, according to a new survey. Some 69 percent told Gallup that they expect their personal finances to be even better next year,” Paul Bedard reports. “What’s more, the survey company said that 50 percent believe they are ‘better off’ than just a year ago when the current economic surge was kicking in.”"
Greater than average volume for the sell off Friday. Similar for many companies. Where to go with the money in the face of inflation? Stocks with debt under control is a start.
Added K to my portfolio today
"LOL don't agree with the political view of the company, Its just that people need to eat...Everyone eats..$$"
is this a buy at this point??
"Why is K up big today, 1/25?"
Join the Boycott of all Kellogg products. They are a left wing liberal organization that opposes American values. Support Breitbart News.
Most of the stuff this company makes is junk food
we are better off not being in Venezuela
"Goodby Kellogg, Playing the liberal card just put you out of business!"
Cheez It or Pringles for the weekend?
good dividend getting into plant based! buying more on a dip
What a great solid buy here
How much would Morningstar Farms gain Kellogg shsreholders with an IPO? The meatless vegan market is really thriving. What is it worth?
Not a loss-an earning beat at 91 cents--careful here.
A bunch of corn flakes running this company! From $75 to under $55 in 6 months --great shareholder return! Keep up the cartoon performance!
"I recently invested in Kellog because I eat their cereals and like their dividend. But being a bit anxious I decided I'd better try Morningstar Farms veggie burgers rather than beyond beef burgers. I had bought into beyond because of all the hype, but I enjoyed them. To my great surprise I preferred the taste of MF's veggie burgers, so I think Kellog will be a strong competitor in the meat-to-plant revolution."
"When it's time for a bowl of cereal I like some cold milk and I grab a box of Kelloggs, who's with me?"
SmRtly praying for a quick pullback from the earnings would love to add 200 shares with a divy yield above 4percent
I ditto Paul ...morningstar farms has lots of growth ahead ...veggie meat is here to stay ..cows are very happy ...investors should be too..
4% yield good buy
#DumpKelloggs
Solid Rocket
"Heard CEO hint to the direction k is going, sounds very sound! Moving the company closer to the frontier of healthy natural foods while avoiding extreme capital expenditure. Dropping old weaker brands while keeping and revitalizing the classics and launching new healthy brands. Also believe they are inspired by the reception beyond meat has received and will explore ways to monetize Morningstar before that market matures"
"The company's sales are falling or at least not growing and for a political stance, they remove their advertising form the eyes of 19 million viewers per month. I wonder if they were asleep when the election numbers came in. As a former investor, 19 minutes ago, I've given up. Project K and ZBB might help the margins on an interim basis, but they won't help sales unless the investors never see the savings because they went into advertising to make up for the lost Breibart ads."
"It didn’t run up before earning. Don’t see it get beaten so much, it is still good compare to last year"
"With a Beta of only .60, this stock has to be one of the most boring stocks there is. For those thinking that this is a good buying opportunity, don't worry if you miss out, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. While you watch the rabbits run, you have this turtle just walking along. I like this stock, but it's a snoozer to watch."
Wonderful new products. High quality brand
"Just started at the Omaha plant 30 days ago. Now on strike because new employees are paid half of what regular employees make. For new employees there is no path to full pay, good insurance and you never get a pension. Employees have to work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and often only have 8 hours off between 12 hour shifts. The CEO just got a $3,000,000 raise because of covid and the workers got $500. Corporate Greed at it's ""finest""."
Sold all my shares...........I will never buy any product from Kellogg's again.
Just bought 2 shares ;)
K owns the largest imitation veg meat producer. I think it is not reflected in stock price. Wonder why this is not well known
This has been hammered. No one buys cereal and groceries anymore? Can’t wait for their earnings blowout
"I look at the supermarket and see huge isles of Yogurt, Protein/Health products. Natural foods, meatless products....healthy theme...time to trade in the Pop-Tarts for healthy foods not just labeled as ""Healthy"" or ""Natural"". Consumers are reading labels."
Adding K tomorrow.
"Their friends over at GIS just floated a bond offering for ""climate change."" No joke."
"complete idiotsalienating half of America b/c of radical left leanings of some of the executives, STOOOOPID!!!"
Why does Kellog always put their sugar cereal (e.g. frosted corn flakes) on sale but never things like plain corn flakes?
They should give them shares in Kellogg as a 401 or IRA contribution. That way everyone has a shared interest and workers are getting a future requirement. I guess wages aren't going up fast enough. This will backfire on them I'm pretty sure.
Yep. That 3.8% dividend could come in handy if the markets get turbulent
"Does anyone else chuckle when looking at the Kelloggs ticker after hours and see ""Post"" by the stock price. Haha Post cereal always gets the final say!"
