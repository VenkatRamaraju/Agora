"If I were a union leader and wanted assert control on how my members we paid, I would own alot of shares in the company. I would direct my members to buy shares in the company….but then I would actually have to consider the ramifications of a strike….my dividends… my initial investment. Hmmm guess thats why unions leaders invest in companies that have no unions….lol"
"well, you put a price tag on the union demands and turn it over to your CFO. Then you set back and see who gets the hair cut. The company, union workers, stock holders or the consumer and go from there."
"Kellogg wants it's employees to not have a comfortable living on 40 hour week. They have been forcing people to work 60 to 80 hours forever. They want them to only make a comfortable living working 80 hours. The employees should demand no more forced overtime, then Kellogg would have to hire twice as many people. Those are hours of their lives that cannot be made up, they are lost forever!! Keep up the strike!!"
Time to go long on Tony the Tiger shelf stock before the supply is depleted. Should be great for q4 sales.
Soon strike will be over and k will be $65.I think investing with crypto will be the best option now especially with the rate of the current market.
"I may be just an average American and I just own 30 shares of Kellogg which I considered a good investment. Nevertheless, I would hope the company would have more respect for their valuable labor force. These stories of having to work 60 -80 hours a week is just wrong. I hope Kellogg's will consider the quality of life of their workers. Who wants an exhausted and abused workforce?"
"I recently invested in Kellog because I eat their cereals and like their dividend. But being a bit anxious I decided I'd better try Morningstar Farms veggie burgers rather than beyond beef burgers. I had bought into beyond because of all the hype, but I enjoyed them. To my great surprise I preferred the taste of MF's veggie burgers, so I think Kellog will be a strong competitor in the meat-to-plant revolution."
"HOW CAN k + AABB Up 2,700 % YR + ALPP Up 7,700 % YR = BEST GAINS in 2021 / 2022. ??"
Nobody ate their cereal today?:p
K has solid pricing power. I like this name under 60
"Their friends over at GIS just floated a bond offering for ""climate change."" No joke."
"Willing to renegotiate?? They will offer top wage to everybody already employed, lay off 70% of the work force, hire them back at half wages and benefits. Don't cave in, protect the future employees!!! Keep up the strike!!"
is special k a legal substance?
They should give them shares in Kellogg as a 401 or IRA contribution. That way everyone has a shared interest and workers are getting a future requirement. I guess wages aren't going up fast enough. This will backfire on them I'm pretty sure.
"Just started at the Omaha plant 30 days ago. Now on strike because new employees are paid half of what regular employees make. For new employees there is no path to full pay, good insurance and you never get a pension. Employees have to work 12 hours a day 7 days a week and often only have 8 hours off between 12 hour shifts. The CEO just got a $3,000,000 raise because of covid and the workers got $500. Corporate Greed at it's ""finest""."
I understand Kellogg's workers are now on strike. Good! I will never forgive the company for discontinuing Product 19!
I bought K in May and it has been doing good. Dividends at 0.91% of price are good too. I will add more on the dips.
I hope they don’t sell out of my Raisin Bran Crunch
Divy raise coming for Kellogg’s GIS and ConAgra
"Nice dividends. Beware, overpaid Michigan workers destroyed the auto industry and cereals are next."
