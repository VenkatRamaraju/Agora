"Share price looking good today. Market as a whole, not so good. Picked up a few shares today. We will see what happens over the next few days.. the economy has been showing signs that it can't continue to grow as fast, but HBAN looks like it should ride things out pretty nicely. Low PE and a good divi give me confidence."
"Wow. Brutal day for all Bank & Oil stocks. Current HBAN price looks enticing, but there is now talk of the FED lowering interest rates again at the next FED meeting 3/17. Bank stocks go down when interest rates are lowered because they make less money on loans, lowering their profits. .But this selling has to stop sometime. In at $11.70. Good luck to the longs !"
My guess on Q2 eps is $.42. Estimate is $.28.
You have to buy before Tuesday 6/15 if you want the dividend.....
Ouch.... Looks like my short term idea has just turned me into a long term holder. Can't afford to get out down here.
"I believe that HBAN may be in for a couple of weeks of volatility. 153 million TCF shares are being tendered into 459 million HBAN shares, HBAN going ex-dividend on 06/16, 10 year T-Bill back under 1.5%, and a huge amount of institutional trading activity.One thing to consider is that both HBAN and TCF have 85%+ institutional ownership & the same ones own millions of shares of HBAN and TCF. They may start trimming their HBAN shares because they now own too much after the deal.Watch today's trading after 3:45 PM EST. That is when the institutions trade.For example,"
In this 4% yield at $13.95
Feeling bearish ahead of earnings. I have an SBA loan threw them and this summer the payments on my loan where around $1850 or so @8.25%.... after 3 fed cuts.... the same loan has a payment of around $1250 w/ interest amounts dropping considerably. They have compound interest working against them on the SBA side of things with the fed cutting.... according to there numbers they did over 600 mill in SBA loans in fiscal 2019.... alot of these loans are 10yrs so they as a rough estimate they could have 3 Bill in SBA loans outstanding... all of which are considerably less profitable. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/huntington-ranks-1-nationally-for-sba-7a-loan-origination-by-volume-300930898.htmlI find it funny they expect 7.5%-8.25% interest on SBA loans but pay next to nothing for deposits. Personally I'm pulling my money out this bank and looking for another bank. Picked up some February puts!
why the big drop today
Held above $14 maybe a start back to 15.50.
"Not sure what genius is dumping all these shares before payday next week...Easy value here, decent growth, inflation should help boost profits + almost 4% yield! Sold some other holdings to buy more here!"
"FED released the results of their 2nd Bank Stress Tests after market close today. Results were very good, banks are generally well capitalized to withstand any loan defaults. The restriction on Bank share buybacks was lifted but buyback amount cannot exceed trailing 12 month earnings. Great news for banks, especially those with solid earnings. Most banks up big in after-hours trading.Not sure if HBAN ot TCF will do any buybacks with the merger in progress."
"If it makes you feel any better, most banks are in the red now. No love for financials right now."
Remember JPM upgraded to $16.50!
This stock falls from $15 to $11 and no one seems bothered.
Waiting to see how HBAN does after the acquisition of TCF bank in October
"PNC plans to recommend to its board of directors an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 10 cents per share, or 9%, to $1.25 per share"
"Bought more, today, 6.17."
"greetings to all I'm surprised that no comments are received today on HBAN. What happened those days   are looking behind you more so the negatively of HBAN thus closing 14.45 and after market hours up or at par.going ex div September time flies, seems an analyst August 2nd pricing 18.50 HBAN.I love Great Banks and the Community HBAN growth comes better divs and buybacks. HBAN a keeper not a complainer here with HBAN Vision."
"Took the opportunity today to unload the whole position just over 11.70, unexpected and welcomed."
Adjusted earnings per common share were $0.35!
Just the beginning folks.
There must be a reason I have not increased my share count in 10 years. Now what would that be?
Great price action.
RF + HBAN- Merger will happen- CNBC did a special on regional bank mergers- Banks must lower costs and gain more efficiency. This would make a great merger.
$40 billion for disadvantaged? Really HBAN? How about $40 billion for your shareholders? Worthless guilt ridden Board. How about make some money and let the disadvantaged figure it out.
"Nice run-up in HBAN the past 3 days - Approx 29% increase from last Friday's low. Still a lot of uncertainty currently, I hope we don't need to re-test the lows of last week. 3 solid positive days but we're still in USA lockdown with unemployment rising every week. What is really amazing is that this week there hasn't been one new post on this message board demanding that HBAN management be fired. All it took was a little bear market rally. LOL.Can't wait for HBAN earning to be announced on 04/23. Hopefully, we'll get some forward guidance & clairity on the financial situation created by the pandemic."
buying back in long term today.
Trying to figure out if I should buy on dip or wait till we get closer to next Div. Cut off date ? All advice welcome!
Testing 14.50 every day￼… Expect a jump to 15 if it can hold above that threshold for any length of time
I just bought more.
"When earnings come out, I just want to see that the dividend is safe. When I bought this stock it was to be conservative. It is probably the same thing that those who bought GE in the 90's were saying."
"6.16.21. I'm in. Apx 17% off highs, apx 5% above 200 SMA (over 1 year chart), yielding 4.15% and plenty of dividend coverage."
"Vote your shares get rid of everyone, they need to sell the bank or everyone needs to go."
Anybody please tell me has HBAN stopped paying a dividend on common shares? Thanks.
"Bofo, I want to thank you for many accurate posts on various bank sites. I just saw an announcement from JPM that they will start a $30 billion share buyback plan. That should start a major run by regional banks. I have been accumulating such shares since March. I would be interested in your thoughts on this."
"CCAR results coming out soon, June 28th. Expect another dividend increase and additional shares to be bought back. I believe investors will be pleasantly surprised. Long since 2010."
"This is my Gem and I am keeping it. Solid Balance sheet, An Excellent Book Value Blow out earning and solid Dividend. I see lot upside coming. $16 is imminent and way to get to $20.. screaming BUY imo"
All insider buying is good...
I also have some Doge coin to the moon baby
"7/27: 10 year down again, stock held up fairly well. Hopefully, this could be a sign of an earnings beat in two days. Tired of sideways price action though. Still hopeful."
"Got Proxy matl yesterday, the vote/meeting is March 25 for the merger, so it should be on target for Q2-2021. After that, there will be 750,000,000 more shares, so I hope the value in TCF is there"
Dividend comes on 4/1/2020/. Stay safe.
Good time to add under $14.70
I am building a 3k portfolio for each of my kids. Short term means nothing as this is 30 years or more. I am looking for obvious financial security and 6% dividend payout. For those that have held for years is this something slow and steady to hold? Thanks
J.P. Morgan just upgraded HBAN to a target of $16.50.
"Suggestion: Read the article by Bram Berkowitz, ""5 reasons the rally in bank stocks is not over"". It covers all the reasons we have been accumulating these stocks for the past year."
Does Huntington have to sell a number of banks to get approval?
"BNY Mellon Announces Intention to Increase Quarterly Common Stock Dividend by 10 Percent to $0.34 per Share and Authorization to Repurchase up to $6.0 Billion of Common Stock.Is our CEO sleeping at the wheel, glad some CEO want to reward the shareholders"
"Great earnings with a good dividend, HBAN could become a take over target in my opinion..."
"They bought TCF at a good time, for a really low price. I wouldn’t be concerned guys. When it was first announced it was considered a brilliant plan. Don’t let today’s negative sway you too much."
Regional Bank Stocks high double digits gains today except Huntington. The lack of leadership shows and the CEO needs to go.
Holy carp Batman. Great earnings and in the toilet????
"Okay, merger of TCF, after increase shares total # 2, 250,000 000, then what happens price of shares?"
bought for takeover..for afootprint....covad puts banks on hold
"I’m here for the dividend, not SP... so I’m good with a drop actually"
Banking reform and the Trump tax breaks should boast HBAN's earnings......imo. Before the tax reform bill was passed HBAN had price targets over $17.00 I wonder if those price targets will get raised. ?
Morgan Stanley delivered one of the biggest surprises to investors by announcing it would double its dividend to 70 cents a share in the third quarter.
is this a good stock to buy?
"Regions Financial increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.17/share from $0.155/share.I hope the CEO and the board are paying attention, the shareholders have been patiance and now needs rewarded versus the executives who are working ""remote"""
Was approved for my SBA loan today for my business expansion! Didn’t get the rate yet they’re still finalizing. Very excited to see what HBAN experience feels like from a consumer perspective as I’m opening accounts w then in the next few days.
Great earnings- Great dividend -Insider buying..Why can't HBAN make a new yearly high ?
love this bank for many years. long
"Take Over,,,I Feel a Take Over-"
"The question is, where do we go from here? Do we continue to melt down to the $6's, bounce around the $8's and low $9's, or break out to $14 range and higher. I think we have a bouncing baby on our hands friends which won't grow up for several years. 2022?"
Merger has been approved!
"They are buying TCF with a slight premium on about a .97 book value/share..... very very cheap. It’s a good time to do this, if they can afford it. Very cheap!"
high dividend stocks will be desirable as this market falls due to slowdown. I think it is a sector rotation that will return.
Today is another great day for the bank to buy back some shares.
Nice to see HBAN climbing back up! Greatly undervalued imo.
"Remember to vote all board members out, vote your shares. This bank is an under performer and is too conservative."
what happened to TCF merger is that going to keep HBAN under pressure? Is this good entry here or wait? I see two side some say it will go down more to $13s and some says it will go above $16s This board is so much confusing. Base on earning report and if merger hapens then imo will go mid $20 to $30. Please help?
Great news all around but this stock only moves 3%. What's holding it back?
"@Omar - Bank Merges/Acquisitions are usually valuated based upon Tangible Book Value, not Total Book Value. This method excludes all the fuzzy valuations such as goodwill.TCF tangible book is $26.07/share & TCF stockholders are receiving 3.0028 shares of HBAN for each TCF share. That represents a fairly high premium for the merger - about 1.4X - 1.5X TBV.HBAN will need to issue approx 500 million additional shares to complete the merger.The new merged HBAN will have different financials as they will need to account for all these new shares & assimilate the TCF assets and liabilities. A bit complex to fully understand how this will all work currently.HBAN has stated that the transaction will initially reduce TBV by 7% (not good) but increase 2022 earnings by 18% (good if it happens).HBAn need to supply current shareholders with much more information on how this merger will work and details on the cost savings and synergies that will be created by forming a larger bank."
"Good action today on HBAN, buyout likely and needed. HBAN can't compete on it's own, would like to see HBAN merge with RF."
"PNC made $14 billion when it sold it's position in Blackrock, now's a great time for PNC to buy Huntington while Huntington's stock stock is so cheap......JMHO"
"I messed up yesterday and bought some HBAN for the 7% dividend? Where I really messed up was not buying RF. Thought about it late in the day and picked up a few shares, but should have bought more of it than HBAN. The SP's were about $1 difference. RF has traded around $3 differance on several occasions in the last couple years. Before that HBAN always had a higher SP than RF. RF seems to be a better bank for SP appreciation in my opinion. We shall see."
They can pay out for the purchase of another bank but can’t raise our dividend ? Not cool
I also own ERF oil stock good dividend if you own enough shares
"Why has HBAN been shellacked in the last month?! If interest rates go up, it gets hit (""divd has to compete with bonds""), if interest rates go down, it gets hit (""won't make as much on their loans""). Why do the analysts make it always a no win situation?! Makes no sense."
Your retirement is under attack - See what you can do to stop the IRS from taking it all at (http://Irsredalert.com)
"If the dividend doesn't rise soon, outside the stock price decline % increase, dividend players will start dropping out in droves. Boring, do nothing but acquire, management needs to start rewarding investors, soon. Many feeling they are not being rewarded."
Where is the leadership at Huntington??? How an announcement on a stock buyback (Many companies have already made accouncments) . What about executives buying stock to show confidence (Steve you did this during the financial crisis). Disappointed in the current management and CEO just become complacent. It is time to leave Steve
I am guessing 14.25 is very close to the bottom. Thoughts?
"Hold your breath everybody, seems to be giving back a lot of yesterdays gains. Most banks down right now. Need to crawl back up during the day."
This merger should be worth $2 or $3 bucks a share within 6 month right? I dont't know ? Any thoughts.
"No way to tell if the div will be cut - HBAN hasn't announced yet. Let's hope they do not need to cut.I believe that it depends on the amount of loan defaults they get & the reduced profits from the interest rates being cut to nearly zero. Last time they cut the div was the 2009 financial crisis. This COVID-19 situation is causing so much havoc, with nearly all business/economic activity shut down in most states. HBAN earnings due out at end of April. Let's hope for more clarity by then."
"Fifth Third's capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in the quarterly common dividend starting in the third quarter of 2021, subject to economic conditions and approval by the Fifth Third Board of Directors. So all Hunington regional competition are raising dividends. I hope the CEO and the board are not sleeping at the wheel. Not increasing the dividend will cause this stock to crash."
It is problematic that HBAN cannot hold $16.00.
"Decent earnings announcement this morning, for the first time somewhat impressed with the numbers considering....... looking forward to the details on the conference call though - at this stage appears HBAN is in better shape than RF"
Huntington Bancshares And TCF Financial Corporation Announce Merger
Also holding off for a 5% yield ($11.20). Anyone want to speculate as to whether it will go that low?
75 million shares have traded in one and a half days is insane.
"7/1 the 10year is up for now. If it holds, could have a nice day. That is holding this and most bank stocks back right now."
"To whoever said HBAN is a bad bank, they are wrong. He must have been denied the cashing of a bogus check"
nice dividend rate--buy & hold
"Buy Buy Buy! They will make money interrest rates will rise!! .48 beat on EPS and will get better, regional banls will consolidate and maybe a major bank will takeout HBAN!"
"All the banks are weak, if interest rates start rising the banks should make good investments...I'm not selling unless something better comes along.....jmho..."
JPM or GS any interest in buying HBAN? The shareholders need your help
Morningstar has it valued at 18.00
"I think I tripled my position today, which finally turned red for me. This is a gift, load up the truck y’all!!"
Fed to backstop all SBA loans. HBAN is #1 in SBA loans. How is this not a screaming buy. Stay safe everybody.
This is the biggest no brainer stock buy I’ve ever seen. HBAN pays 60 cents a share in dividends…bank of America which has a stock price of over $40 pays 72 cents a share…buy buy buy
Back to 13.
Adding now at this price. long / small part of my retirement fund.
hows Huntington goin
The overall market is driving HBAN down today. Below 15 gets me to buy more.
This company continues to be a methodical lump that can't get out of its own way. Dynamic leadership must replace the ultra conservative leadership that does nothing for shareholder value.
Attention Marketing people at Huntington. I would like the bank to provide free mask with their logo instead of the green pens. Times have changed and I would like to see Huntington lead the charge in this crisis and it would show the commitment to the recovery process and its customers. Let get this idea going!!!
Daily volume has been increasing over the past 3 weeks.
What is HBAN loan exposure to oil companies?
2017 Total Return:HBAN 12.98%RF 22.95%S&P500 Financials Index 22.14%
Huntington is getting more of the small business loans now than any other regional bank.
"Using $1.52 for eps and $8.64 as book value, the Graham number is $17.19."
Looks like the market is finally starting to value HBAN...nearly a straight line from $14.60 to $16.00 over the past four weeks!
800MM shares outstanding 6/16 and over 1B shares outstanding 6/19. That $513MM repurchase (if it actually happens) is a drop in the $14.5B market cap bucket. I was really hoping HBAN would be more aggressive.
Negative Bank outlooks causing sell off? Selling before Quarterly Report?
"Time for a Dividend increase, We have been waiting well over a year and if they don't the CEO and board will all need to lose their jobs."
I was right about investing in banks down voters especially HBAN. The fed has to much power over them and many will be cutting dividends in the coming quarters. HBAN will be no exception.
Finally looks like a good day for banking. Hope to get a boost here.
Banks only make $ and have very reasonable pe ratios so why shouldn't the drop 15% or more...in a week. Anybody figures out Wall Street please advice me.
reward this stock already with a higher multiple. look at the dividend yield for good sakes
Div is good. Company is strong.
No dividend increase after 8 quarters of .15 cent.
"10.1.21. sold HBAN, today into strength. Up almost 20% in a short time. Taking profits."
"10-year treasuries have risen approx 14 basis points in the past few days. That is a large move & virtually all bank stocks have risen with them. Amazing how a few positive days for the bank stocks always silences the negative doom-and-gloom crowd on this board. I'm sure we will hear their nonsense the next time banks are down.Banks still have some challenges, but should continue to rise with COVID vaccine administration, business recovery, and interest rates rising over time."
"Needs to get back to 16.00 a share and maintain there! I bought more on this dip, can’t help myself I like the dividend ￼ ￼"
they are going to close a lot of branches
"The lower it goes, the more I will buy. Cost averaging is an amazing thing."
We need Donald Trump
"The CEO needs to implement a new round of hedging strategies based off the latest events, or merge with a bank that can navigate through this crisis since the stock hasn't done anything in the past year."
"Huntington closing branches will be used as an ""excuse"" of why they missed earnings forecast versus the lack of leadership at the top."
What is going on with this stock?
"This pig needs a bump in dividend. Based on $15.69, the dividend is under 4%. Also, the volume is very low up to this point today. The mgt and bod's need to raise the dividend at least .02 per qtr. if they want the price to go up. This stock is not a trading/low div. stock like wfc, bac etc. Buyers need incentives to buy this stock, and dividend is the incentive. Quit acquiring."
Such strong results this quarter. It seems odd that the stock isn't reacting more positively today.
"Not a bad year. Yes, there are other time frames that can fit ones agenda; feel free to suggest a different date field.12/31/18 - 12/31/19 Total ReturnHBAN 31.74%RF 33.30%S&PFinancialINdex 32.09S & P 500 31.48%VTSAX 30.80VTI 30.67%I'm content and will remain long."
"Between the great quarterly results and the merger we should see one of several possible changes; an increase in the dividend, a buyout of us, or continued buyouts of other banks."
STRONG BUY WILL BE 15-18 by FEB STRONG STRONG BUY!!
Anybody know what this jump is about?
IMHO this due to the acquisition IOWA regional Bank announcement. May be due to that I hope it doesn't put scratch on Balance sheet. They have not yet closed the TCF deal and here is another acquisition. Does anyone know how much and detail of this new acquisition cost and how HBAN is paying????
Pricy!!
"HBAN I Bought TCF in the 1979 and 1980s around same share price as HBAN now. Look where TCF was on June 9th 45.18 thus 52 week high around 60s. HBAN now Larger Bank and Better Bank.I can say buy all in on HBAN today's stock prices on HBAN are a tremendous Value, no where are you going to get a bond rate this good at 14.40 currently.VZ Verizon 56.60 to get 4.37 percent.I am saying you will in the future see 60.00 a share for HBAN and not as long of time it took TCF I wish I would have bought more of TCF then and Held it.I am not making that same mistake with HBAN, thus I am buying more and holding it to hit in the 90s share price.I'm sure dividends will commensurate higher with the stock and earnings.I place a strong buy on HBAN price to 21.00 in a year at a great value. I continue to buy as I can as an investor for many years in the stock market. I am very bullish on HBAN."
lets keep this roll going
Good luck tomorrow longs.
great volume
"Has anyone heard anything about a potential buyout just north of $20? Dividends, buyback, underperformer with strong fundamentals and aggressively marketing in the South (Texas and surrounding states). I’m skeptical of such rumors hence I ask.A friend bought a car (in Texas) and financing rates came in cheaper via Huntington than BofA. So a buyout could seem plausible...P.S. I’m long on this around 14.90ish per share with 11k. Would make a nice payday if there was a buyout.Worst case, dividends.Thoughts?"
"IMO, HBAN Q2 earnings should come in right around consensus estimates - .28/share. Remember that the next couple of quarters after an acquisition are usually bogged down with closure costs. In addition, the low interest rates are putting pressure on all bank earnings. HBAN will begin to get earnings synergies from the merged companies in 2022."
"I worked for Huntington for a time. They, like many other banks are run by weak, empty suit types that go along to get along because most know that but for the job they have there, they are employable elsewhere. The CEO leads by intimidation because he can. Intimidating weak individuals while occasionally riding a wave of an economic uptick is not innovation or leadership, it is the act of arrogance from someone with Napoleon complex. All banks rise when the economy does and by any metric HBAN falls short of its peers and yet the CEO and Board of Directors rewards themselves for doing the absolute minimum. If you are looking for a decent dividend it's fine but if you are expecting stellar performance you won't find it anywhere at Huntington."
Dividend increased by 27%. Share buyback represents 6% of the current market cap. More than I expected. Long since 2010.
"COLUMBUS, Ohio – Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Nasdaq: HBAN; www.huntington.com) was notified on June 25, 2020 by the Federal Reserve that under their severely adverse economic stress scenario in the 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”), Huntington's modeled capital ratios would continue to exceed the minimum requirements under the Federal Reserve's capital adequacy rules. These stress test results support the company’s previously communicated ability to declare its current quarterly dividend of $0.15 per common share for the third quarter of 2020, subject to approval by the Board of Directors during the planned meeting in July. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement is at the minimum of 2.5%.As a result of the changes in the financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve will provide updated scenarios for all participating banks to resubmit capital plans later this year.“Huntington is committed to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities during these challenging economic times,” said Stephen D. Steinour, chairman, president, and CEO. “Disciplined risk management, including adherence to our aggregate moderate‐to‐low risk appetite, and capital management provide the foundation for that commitment. We have strong capital and robust liquidity, and our core earnings power remains solid. Consistent with prior results, our performance in the severely adverse scenario remains one of the best among the regional banks and clearly reflects our expectation for strong relative performance through the cycle.”"
Long term investors are quietly picking up shares at bargain basement prices...Once they are done they will begin upgrading HBAN......jmho
HBAN management do the shareholders a favor and sell the bank. Consistent under performer !
TCF conversions happened this weekend. As if today all TCF branches are now Huntington.
I finally did something good with this stock! Sold the day after the high and downgrade... feel like a genius today. I’ll be back in under $13
"Banks down again. In at $15.24, hope to sell before ed-dividend if it climbs up at all. Short term for me right now."
"In my opinion when the market finally turns companies like HBAN will be the first to recover..Some like oils and cruise lines will take longer..I would not be surprised to see a wave of takeovers, HBAN would be at the top of someones shopping list , it's a strong regional bank that PNC or Mellon would love to own....."
HBAN energy exposure is 1.2% of total assets / Key is 2.1% / Zions 2.1% / Regions 1.7% / Comerica 3.3% / Goldman 1.2% / Wells .7% / JPM .5%
Stock has languished for years. Years.
My guess for Q1 eps is $.40.
"I just paid my credit card bill, not sure if that will help the stock."
Goldman reinstates at buy with $18 target
"Are they buying back their own stock, I thought that took place last quarter?"
"HBAN-TCF deal is scheduled to close ""On or about 6/9/2021"".Massive HBAN volume at end of day must be related to the conversion of the TCF shares to HBAN shares and combining of the two company's balance sheets. Hopefully, deal closes this week."
Nice support today in a down market.
"If I had more cash I would be adding shares on this weakness.....The world is not coming to an end, people will buy homes this summer and the spread of the virus will eventually end....Buy good stocks on weakness....JMHO"
banks will consolodate...maybe sale sign on that vol.or fundamentals
"I have stated many times the difference in RF's and HBAN's SP's. At one time HBAN's was $1 more then RF. After buying first merit HBAN has done virtually nothing. RF went on to a SP arounf $3 higher than HBAN's. Back in march or so the SP's were virtually the same. RF has now pulled away around $3 a share. Wish I had bought more RF a few months ago. HBAN is a dividend stock, nothing more. I still have a few shares I bought several months ago to sell. Ten or above will do."
Wow… down we go. If the yield gets to 5% load up the trucks again…
Banks are going to make $$ 2021
don't worry. It will reach 16 by Christmas
Added more today at 14.30.
Still completing the tcf merger and that will take time. $800 million stock buyback makes this happy shareholder salivate. Hope the price doesn’t go up too much more because I’m still buying more! Go long HBAN for that divy!!
HBAN declared their next dividend payout today. $.15/share paid on 7/1/2020. ex-dividend date is 6/17/2020.Great that they are maintaining the dividend through the tough Q2.
Proposing 7% div increase for Q3 and 500 million in share repurchase. I'll take it
Why hasn't this bank been a takeover target?
"Merging with investment bank always plus, very easy to introduce to customers about 200 branch, great benefit to mostly TCF. Is anyone have future advice? buy or sell?"
Biggest bank bargain on the market right now
"In mergers, the acquiring company’s stock will usually fall. The acquired company’s stock usually gains. Arbs have played this for years with more to be made with non-financial company mergers. Today’s volume, I believe, shows our Wall Street friends all over this deal."
"HBAN is paying a .15/share dividend on April 1 to stockholders of record as of March 18 (last Wednesday). This was announced a couple of months ago, before the virus stuff started.It is the forward guidance released at the next quarterly earnings call at end of April that we need to watch."
Sit tight! It’s a great and profitable bank. Where else are you going to get a 4% dividend while you wait for it to appreciate in price. With their current purchase they are worth at least $23 a share
If it keeps falling
"HBAN is in the process of merging with TCF who just acquired from BBT/TRUIST their Commercial Equipment Capital Corp worth around $1,000,000,000. Is there a date when this merger is finalized?"
"6/28, the 10 year note is not our friend today. The whole banking sector is down. It has to rise if HBAN is to rise. Still like the stock though."
"POEM for the Huntington Board:With a new 52 week low, it is time for Steve Steinhour to go. Get rid of this guy and pull all bonuses and restricted stock options from the ELT."
Out at $16.15...................good luck everyone!!
"Maybe I am just Green when it comes to investments, but I feel that one problem with HBAN is that they fail to make regular post about whats happening on a daily basis. I'm sure they are paying someone big bucks to do PR/Marketing, but we're lucky to see one comment a month. I have been long since they bought out Sky Bank and my values immediately tanked by 90%. I also am 20 plus years long on Adobe, and they have positive news every single day."
"HBAN upgraded this morning. Raymond James upgrades to Strong Buy from Outperform, price target $18."
"greetings to all having HBAN, I like the dividends but I bought and am buying for the capital gains. I say again I bought TCF back in the day when same around price as HBAN is now and saw it go to 50 plus, so I believe in the vision of this day HBAN can achieve That however sooner than it took TCF to get up to 50 plus. HBAN much larger bank and better dividends than TCF had closing price in June 45.00 plus.I'm bullish on HBAN so will you more so in time.Look at WTFC and those that see the dividends. <1%The dividends seekers can go with VZ there it's 4.5 %I see nothing wrong with EFC ERC also. Dividends RF, or KEY. I heard the complainers back in the day about Amazon and Netflix where it's was 20.00 and 12.00 respectively. today's another chapter . The Great value is AT&T both HBAN going places.  until the next posting  Road"
"Share price down. HBAN never recovered from the first meriot acquisition. Will this be the same? CEO talks about long term shareholder value, but all I see is an overpaid CEO."
"If there is anyone waiting to get into HBAN because of the law suits over TCF, think about the fact that HBAN paid 150% of tangible book value. Don't think a judge will listen to those lawyers more than a minute!"
"Extended Trades is showing the company reported on 12/31 they bought back 452,395 shares and currently hold 5,527,689 shares. Comments?"
"Jesse selling a few branches is not, I repeat not a takeover."
Waiting on a buyout opportunity? No one is going to invest upwards of 15 Bil in buying a mediocre performing regional.
At least it closed over $14. I will take that as a plus. Tough to give up most of Thur. gains today. Let's see what next week brings.
Is anyone talking about their online app not working? Did they get hacked?
Showing strength now 
What a beautiful dividend stock! Long and strong 
"HBAN Q1 earnings out tomorrow Thurs 4/22.Average EPS estimate is .34, low est .28, high est .42Average revenue estimate is $1.22 billion.Look for future guidance & information on the merger closure, that will move the stock price."
LARGE dividend and buyback increases are being announced after hours by the banks.
Another new high today. This is the beginning.
"7/19 the 10 year is still going down. Going to be painful today. Just hold strong, banks are a good investment in the long term. Going to take longer than expected to see any profit here."
@Juice the difference is between 20 Vs 349 billion cap
"All in all, not a bad week. Hope the momentum carries into next week."

"someone bought 6,800 Nov $13 PUTS in the last hour of trading....obviously expecting a big decline after earnings....Someone also bought 3,000 Nov $14 CALLS and 3,000 Nov $14 PUTS in the last hour as well....some sort of straddle I guess...The 3,200 Nov $15 CALLS appear to be someone cashing out of a portion of the large 9,700 that has been there for the last three weeks...Mostly, the play seems to be for a decline after earnings, but the stock drop has brought this down to a reasonable valuation....let's hope so....I have 4,500 shares and it has not been fun the last several days....Good luck longs."
I listened to the HBAN earnings report this morning. A question was raised: why 20% loss reserve for energy company investments when other banks loss reserves are 2%?HBAN answer wanted to be conservative for potential losses.Question: What are the HBAN energy company names and how big are the loans?
HBAN Q2 earnings results were very good. It is good that HBAN management is front-loading the majority of TCF acquisition expenses into Q2. It is projected that all TCF assimilation expenses will be completed by the end of 2021. Future earnings look very rosy. The $800 million share buyback program is also great news as it will get the stock price up. Looking forward to listening to the conference call for future guidance & seeing the new combined balance sheet of HBAN/TCF.
if it wasn't for the buyout opportunity I'd be a seller. This stock can't get out of it's own way
"Once again, banking sector down in general. Not helping HBAN. Hopefully holds at at least $15 by end of day. Crazy action at end of day yesterday."
like everything about this bank but the price
HBAN down 21%
"@Bill - If you were unhappy with your HBAN investment, you did the right thing by selling. Holding any investment & whining/moaning/complaining about it makes no sense & just gives the investor headaches.Just out of curiosity, your cost basis on your HBAN shares was 13.05. The .60 dividend yielded you 4.6% annually. You sold 50,000 shares at 15.60 for $780,000. Where did you re-invest that money to give you a yield that good on a stock with a relatively secure dividend payment with upside capital gain potential?"
Will--go buy a bank in China-you will be treated very nicely from your residence in Siberia
"These regional banks will find their time in the sun sometime in the future. Continue to reinvest the divs, build share count. And then trim or sell all in the next bank bull phase. Conservative run bank. Disappointed in the capital return."
My gut tells me that smart investors are building positions in the regional banks......The virus will pass and people will resume home buying and home remodeling........jmho
"HBAN reports 2020 Q4 earnings on Friday 1/22. Average consensus is approx .29/share earnings & $1.25 billion revenue. While 4Q earnings numbers are important to hit, it is in the past. The forward guidance & loan loss status needs to be positive news also to support the huge run-up in share price recently."
What a beautiful stock
"I sold my total holdings of 50,000 shares yesterday at 15.60 no dividend increase no more patience ! I bought stock for 13.05 so I got paid, I don’t like how it’s managed,, good luck"
They are spinning their wheels a bit. Conservative midwest bank. Just continue to increase the dividend by 7-9% per year. That will keep me happy. Long term holder.
