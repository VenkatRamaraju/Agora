Goldman reinstates at buy with $18 target
"FED released the results of their 2nd Bank Stress Tests after market close today. Results were very good, banks are generally well capitalized to withstand any loan defaults. The restriction on Bank share buybacks was lifted but buyback amount cannot exceed trailing 12 month earnings. Great news for banks, especially those with solid earnings. Most banks up big in after-hours trading.Not sure if HBAN ot TCF will do any buybacks with the merger in progress."
"greetings to all having HBAN, I like the dividends but I bought and am buying for the capital gains. I say again I bought TCF back in the day when same around price as HBAN is now and saw it go to 50 plus, so I believe in the vision of this day HBAN can achieve That however sooner than it took TCF to get up to 50 plus. HBAN much larger bank and better dividends than TCF had closing price in June 45.00 plus.I'm bullish on HBAN so will you more so in time.Look at WTFC and those that see the dividends. <1%The dividends seekers can go with VZ there it's 4.5 %I see nothing wrong with EFC ERC also. Dividends RF, or KEY. I heard the complainers back in the day about Amazon and Netflix where it's was 20.00 and 12.00 respectively. today's another chapter . The Great value is AT&T both HBAN going places.  until the next posting  Road"
"Dismal earnings , disappointing dividend increase. Below average bank, below average CEO and Board he is ok with complacent earnings. Yep just keep collecting your bonus for below average work and make the shareholders pay. Wall Street has spoken and the stock price is down. FACTS!!!!"
Out at $16.15...................good luck everyone!!
They had some interesting insights about HBAN on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Needs to get back to 16.00 a share and maintain there! I bought more on this dip, can’t help myself I like the dividend ￼ ￼"
Waiting to see how HBAN does after the acquisition of TCF bank in October
"Not a bad year. Yes, there are other time frames that can fit ones agenda; feel free to suggest a different date field.12/31/18 - 12/31/19 Total ReturnHBAN 31.74%RF 33.30%S&PFinancialINdex 32.09S & P 500 31.48%VTSAX 30.80VTI 30.67%I'm content and will remain long."
They are spinning their wheels a bit. Conservative midwest bank. Just continue to increase the dividend by 7-9% per year. That will keep me happy. Long term holder.
"I believe that HBAN may be in for a couple of weeks of volatility. 153 million TCF shares are being tendered into 459 million HBAN shares, HBAN going ex-dividend on 06/16, 10 year T-Bill back under 1.5%, and a huge amount of institutional trading activity.One thing to consider is that both HBAN and TCF have 85%+ institutional ownership & the same ones own millions of shares of HBAN and TCF. They may start trimming their HBAN shares because they now own too much after the deal.Watch today's trading after 3:45 PM EST. That is when the institutions trade.For example,"
Ouch.... Looks like my short term idea has just turned me into a long term holder. Can't afford to get out down here.
Wow…
"I sold my total holdings of 50,000 shares yesterday at 15.60 no dividend increase no more patience ! I bought stock for 13.05 so I got paid, I don’t like how it’s managed,, good luck"
Hban dudes will be higher by next week.
I listened to the HBAN earnings report this morning. A question was raised: why 20% loss reserve for energy company investments when other banks loss reserves are 2%?HBAN answer wanted to be conservative for potential losses.Question: What are the HBAN energy company names and how big are the loans?
"10.1.21. sold HBAN, today into strength. Up almost 20% in a short time. Taking profits."
"Bofo, I want to thank you for many accurate posts on various bank sites. I just saw an announcement from JPM that they will start a $30 billion share buyback plan. That should start a major run by regional banks. I have been accumulating such shares since March. I would be interested in your thoughts on this."
Just closed out my checking and savings account at Huntington Bank. They bought out Chemical bank and TCF closed out my old accounts provided no help for automatic deposits or debits never sent new checks or debit card for new account. Opened new account at Fifth Third they were helpful with everything.Huntington is lazy and have the attitude that you are lucky just to do business with them. Considered buying stock not any more terrible company!
"HBAN Q1 earnings out tomorrow Thurs 4/22.Average EPS estimate is .34, low est .28, high est .42Average revenue estimate is $1.22 billion.Look for future guidance & information on the merger closure, that will move the stock price."
Huntington is getting more of the small business loans now than any other regional bank.
HBAN Q2 earnings results were very good. It is good that HBAN management is front-loading the majority of TCF acquisition expenses into Q2. It is projected that all TCF assimilation expenses will be completed by the end of 2021. Future earnings look very rosy. The $800 million share buyback program is also great news as it will get the stock price up. Looking forward to listening to the conference call for future guidance & seeing the new combined balance sheet of HBAN/TCF.
I am building a 3k portfolio for each of my kids. Short term means nothing as this is 30 years or more. I am looking for obvious financial security and 6% dividend payout. For those that have held for years is this something slow and steady to hold? Thanks
"When earnings come out, I just want to see that the dividend is safe. When I bought this stock it was to be conservative. It is probably the same thing that those who bought GE in the 90's were saying."
HBAN declared their next dividend payout today. $.15/share paid on 7/1/2020. ex-dividend date is 6/17/2020.Great that they are maintaining the dividend through the tough Q2.
Added more today at 14.30.
Dividend increased by 27%. Share buyback represents 6% of the current market cap. More than I expected. Long since 2010.
TCF conversions happened this weekend. As if today all TCF branches are now Huntington.
"7/19 the 10 year is still going down. Going to be painful today. Just hold strong, banks are a good investment in the long term. Going to take longer than expected to see any profit here."
"@Bill - If you were unhappy with your HBAN investment, you did the right thing by selling. Holding any investment & whining/moaning/complaining about it makes no sense & just gives the investor headaches.Just out of curiosity, your cost basis on your HBAN shares was 13.05. The .60 dividend yielded you 4.6% annually. You sold 50,000 shares at 15.60 for $780,000. Where did you re-invest that money to give you a yield that good on a stock with a relatively secure dividend payment with upside capital gain potential?"
Pricy!!
"HBAN upgraded this morning. Raymond James upgrades to Strong Buy from Outperform, price target $18."
"can anyone tell me what it means when they say they are ""mining a bitcoin""?"
"This pig needs a bump in dividend. Based on $15.69, the dividend is under 4%. Also, the volume is very low up to this point today. The mgt and bod's need to raise the dividend at least .02 per qtr. if they want the price to go up. This stock is not a trading/low div. stock like wfc, bac etc. Buyers need incentives to buy this stock, and dividend is the incentive. Quit acquiring."
"@Omar - Bank Merges/Acquisitions are usually valuated based upon Tangible Book Value, not Total Book Value. This method excludes all the fuzzy valuations such as goodwill.TCF tangible book is $26.07/share & TCF stockholders are receiving 3.0028 shares of HBAN for each TCF share. That represents a fairly high premium for the merger - about 1.4X - 1.5X TBV.HBAN will need to issue approx 500 million additional shares to complete the merger.The new merged HBAN will have different financials as they will need to account for all these new shares & assimilate the TCF assets and liabilities. A bit complex to fully understand how this will all work currently.HBAN has stated that the transaction will initially reduce TBV by 7% (not good) but increase 2022 earnings by 18% (good if it happens).HBAn need to supply current shareholders with much more information on how this merger will work and details on the cost savings and synergies that will be created by forming a larger bank."
What a disappointment in the increase of the dividend. A WHOLE 1/2 CENT PER QUARTER.
"Share price looking good today. Market as a whole, not so good. Picked up a few shares today. We will see what happens over the next few days.. the economy has been showing signs that it can't continue to grow as fast, but HBAN looks like it should ride things out pretty nicely. Low PE and a good divi give me confidence."
What a beautiful stock

"HBAN-TCF deal is scheduled to close ""On or about 6/9/2021"".Massive HBAN volume at end of day must be related to the conversion of the TCF shares to HBAN shares and combining of the two company's balance sheets. Hopefully, deal closes this week."
