CEO - Brian Cornell is so positive!!! Nice to see!!!
"Analyst with upgrades. bAC takes price target to $317, GS target to $281, CS takes the price to $286. Raymond James increases target to $285. Davidson moves to $285. Citi increases price to $287. So there it goes 6 price target increases this AM."
Does anybody know why the big fall pre-market today after decent earnings report?
CFRA maintains strong buy. 12 month target now $300. First upgrade. Really just upgraded price target higher. Maybe other analysts will follow? Ugly close.
"TGT blows away earnings as expected. This company has had monstrous performance over the last several years, easily outperforming its peers. Valuation is no object for me, this company has proven to be immune to e commerce."
"People on Wall Street love to mislead, even lie to people. My post on share count reduction on a 15 billion buyback keeps getting deleted by some here. 15 billion authorized at an average price of 245 could lead to a reduction in shares outstanding of roughly 60 million shares. There are roughly 494 million shares of TGT. That is a possible 12% reduction which would offset YOY sales declines."
15 billion dollar buyback announced 
I love panic sellers. Warren Buffett = “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient”
buyback is almost 10% of the shares. I'm ready to be a target investor. By the time that buyback is done they will have another cash to do another big buyback. Let's go!
Target clobbers earnings!!! Buy the dip!!! Wow!!! 15billion buyback!!!
They are going to buy bak some stocks so what is going to happen to this price? LOL wait and find out
"Timing timing timing, the tutes and retail investors will be buying on the dips, short term it looks like it’ll get clobbered (though it makes no sense) give it till November and it’ll be making all time highs again (barring any meltdown of the market itself that is)"
"I bought in at 248.49. I would say that is a pretty good purchase. I didn't know it would go into the 247's, but I am happy."
Earning leaked! Stock going higher ahead of ER!!
$15BN IN SHARE REPURCHASES IS ENOUGH SECURITY FOR ME.BUY BIUY BUY!GO TGT!
"There is no reason for this to be down with the quarter and year that TGT has had so far, plus the buy backs. It must just be profit takers, but this is headed towards $300. I wasn't in TGT at 267, but I bought the discount today."
I remember the days when this TGT was trading at $267. Wait! that was 9 days ago before great earnings and a $15b buyback. Wondering if it is profit taking and options expirations because down $22 in less than 9 days is seems a bit overdone.
"""THE NEXT AMAZON"""
Not concerned one bit about the profit taking! Glad investors got out at these prices. Targets diverse and growing business model will rival Amazon in the next 5-10 years. Holding long and strong!

Talk about nonsense coming from the talking heads on TV. TGT vs WMT....40% YTD vs 4%....How about valuation? No mention of valuation....TGT still less expensive than WMT.....by a lot.

"Looks like the same scenario as yesterday with home depot,Great numbers, but not good enough for the street.So Ill ask this question,If the street is so smart why did they put expectations higher than where they know they should be?They couldn’t see that last year was covid driven?Shouldnt they expect numbers to be a little lower after a period of panic shopping?Or are they just setting up a profit for their hedge fund buddies?Whatever,It is what it is,It should be a good buying opportunity.After HD got hammered yesterday the upgrades came pouring in at 3:45.Gotta love this job."
Abysmal. Not selling a share though.
Awesome beat with buy back icing. $270+ today
I don't know why people keep saying why is TGT so high. Its got a forward PE 22. That's not bad at all when you compare it to most growth stocks. Its easily going to $300
Amazon that Lowe’s reports numbers that are similar to target and the stock is up 6 right now!! Market is funny
Nice reading about the expanding of Target's Disney store partnership this morning. This will continue to increase foot traffic and sales. This management team seems to have made all the right moves the past couple of years. I feel this is a great opportunity to buy TGT here on the recent pullback from 267. Earnings were very good. Leadership is great. Future looks very bright for them.
Everything looks positive for TGT. Short term the market is hard to predict. But it really looks good as a long term hold to me.
I just bought more shares of TGT on this dip!!! Easy Money!!! GO TGT GO!!!
"why do stocks fall on good news? I don't own any shares of target, but what is the point of selling after the good news, why not sell before?"
"WMT rocked earnings today, and TGT will rock their earnings tomorrow!!! GO TGT GO!!!"
"Holding strong, earnings were great, this was a massive disappointment to wake up to but you don’t lose anything if you don’t sell. Dividend keeps me patient."
Targets massive PPS already baked into these earnings. Margins down and that trend will continue as sales slow with less economic stimulus. Pulls back from here.
Target had a stellar quarter. You are getting a BIG discount at this price.
Bought in at $80.... sold at $110.... Never bought back in after that.Some of my biggest mistakes have been selling stocks too early.
Great earning beats ...plus 15B buy back is awesome ...should finish on the 5% green today or above $ 270 after opening.
260 this week ?
