What’s up with Target. Lost over 8% in a month
What's their buy back plan. I saw 15b is that right?
"I have been using Target curbside pickup for over a year. Absolute best service. Tried Walmart once, never again. Low $230s is a steal."
"What is all the hype with ""buy now pay later"" AKA credit? I mean call CREDIT by another name and it is all the rage? Additionally, it is easy to expand credit facilities/lines in a boom economy with lots of consumer savings/disposable income/government support."

buy at $260 on mon
"If you own shares in this company do your self a favor and talk to employees then you’ll see whether to hold , sell ,or buy . Target not only has supplies issues but has major employment issues, they are losing employees left & right and having a hard time finding employees. California a major part of there profit is looking bad really bad "
"Their profits sharply increase Q2 of 2020. What changed to make them increase so much and how can TGT sustain that rate of profitability? BTW, their profits dropped precipitously during most recent quarter. TGT is a great company that will continue growing, but not sure if it will continue at this parabolic rate."
Amazon just reported awful earnings. what makes people think this pps will hold up for TGT ?
"Now, in a Globe exclusive, San Francisco Police Department has revealed that the iconic Target on Mission Street between Third and Fourth Streets will be shutting its doors before the end of the year.“This store loses $25,000 a day to shoplifting,” an SFPD officer told the Globe in lengthy, taped interviews conducted this week. “That’s $25,000 that walks out the door on average between 9 and 6 every day.”"
with the fall/ winter holiday season people want stuff even more...pent up demand...
I think its inflation fears and there is strong sentiment that the holiday season wont be great this year due to supply shortages. then add the winter brings in flu season which could spark covid again.

it would seem tgt would benefit from affirm...
Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advise them against investing and trading BTC while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially

"Target changing settings of online account, without customer consent, to unethically and I believe illegally charge consumers interest on Red Card."
"Interesting reading the comments below. I do think you have a great company but have you been in one of the stores lately? They try stretching out what inventory they have but they are under stocked just as Home Depot is and others that rely on imports. Look at the backlog at all the ports, not just in the US but in China. With energy prices going through the roof, and the shortages, retailers could have a very tough Christmas Season."
"mf article is interesting..but there are a lot of people who want to buy this season...and there is pent up demand for comfort stuff..many of these people do not have credit cards, this opens the door for them..."
went to 2 local Targets shelf were stuffed full lol supply chains my as!! lots were full outer suburbs lol
"does the company goes up when there’s supply issue? i’m thinking about buying, any opinion will greatly appreciated"
"TGT has been navigating supply chain challenges for months, ordering larger quantities in advance and partnering with vendors to fast-track orders. Plus, their ending inventory at the end of Q2 was more than $2.5 billion, or 26% higher, than PY. They've even chartered their own container ships to avoid backed-up ports. Panic selling has caused a great opportunity to buy a great retailer at a discount price."
TGT is down because of BBBY. Possible supply chain issue.
"Good fundamentals and great earnings & profits, why the downtrend?"
"Do not own Target stock and never will. I live less than a mile from a nice Target store, and I will never shop at Target again. They keep billing my Credit Card for 72 Cents after I made my last purchase, and they tell me it is a computer glitch, and they will get it fixed. In addition, the drive up delivery sucks. Walmart you drive up and call a number on the sign they bring your order right out. Target you have to use some Dam that doesn't work, so you have to wait and flag a passing employee. Crazy to own a stock like this. (Complaint Case # 121205668)"
Best performing retailer next to Costco. Costco trading at 36X 2023 eps. TGT 18X. I don't think Costco is worth twice as much so I think TGT has room to move higher.
Lets go Brandon!
Not sure where you are but Targets around me have decent stock except electronics
shorted 2025 shares at 247
"Wow, $25 off the high. One would think this is a superb buying opportunity."
"I have $60K for long term,Can anyone from $t, $vz, $ko, $mcd, $tgt, $cost tell me why I should buy any among these and not on $tsla, $coin, $msft, $fb...etc and $aapl. pls no $pltr I do not need scam company that only benefits the CEO and his boys with unlimited insider's dilutions."
shorted 1600 shares at 256.20 after the goldman pump
anybody know about the gift card of $14.99???
"The last big drop of $40 of the high was beginning of covid(03/2020), this time it drops almost the same, it doesn’t make sense. What went wrong this time?"
Are there any buyers out there besides me? This downward trend has to end at some point. EPS is through the roof and the stock continues to go down. What am I missing?

This is not a correction anymore
"I’m looking for a civil conversation about this so let’s not try to bash me or others. Is there a possibility that the mm’s are walking the stock back so TGT can accelerate their $15bb share buyback program and get the shares at lower prices? I’m surprised over the past few weeks to see the stock drop on pretty low volume. There’s been nothing I can find to justify the drop other than maybe this share buyback theory. In general, the buyback is a good thing so IMO it’s worth waiting this out. Thoughts?"
"Well, typical WS bull…batter a solid stock for weeks on end for no reason and when retail is stopped out or frustrated they run it up ten percent in a few sessions and then sell calls and upgrade. Easy $ for Wall Street. If you are long you can only buy and hold if you believe in the stock."
