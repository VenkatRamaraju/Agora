"Goldman said the retail buying boom has just started! I concur, AMATEURS LOL"
"Where do we go from here? TGT reported very good earnings and gave good forward guidance. All earnings metrics appeared good save margins. It seems appropriate that margin erosion would happen with the increase in digital sales. Competing with AMZ is a battle. It seems that TGT has figured out how. With 17 holds on the stock, there's certainly room for some analyst upgrades. Typically, upgrades beget more buying. A couple of charting sites give good reports on TGT:https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TGThttps://www.americanbulls.com/SignalPage.aspx?lang=en&Ticker=TGTAs we wait, TGT's 3.52% dividend coupled with a low 10 year, gives us all a cushion. Obviously, anything can and will happen in the investing world. I'm comfortable being long TGT going forward...Jeff"
"Target has a rolling pattern. After 7% fall from its peak, it rises 20%"
"Target is way too low. All a bunch of overstated worries and maybes. All the while, the stores are Fresh & New and packed with shoppers! I think their earnings are gonna knock it out of the park! GLTAL"
What a great month for Target longs! Hope everyone loaded up by now. I doubled up around $206 and am enjoying watching TGT rise with almost no resistance. Not a great time to be short unfortunately.
"TGT at $100 would still have a pe of less than 18. This compares to Cost 33 pe, Wmt. 35 pe, If you notice per centage-wise, TGT is climbing faster on a daily basis than the 2 companies I mentioned. $90 is around the corner than a slow climb to $100 by earnings, just my opinion."
good morning ken! 230 yet?
+292% gain. Bought in at $54 a share. My first investment at 25 years old
Two trades for you heading into the fall.Dkng for football seasonTgt for back to school
Great entry point at 60
"Target knew $2000 for everyone is not going to happen, so Target did a ""Clever way to cheer shareholder up"". ""No $2000! No problem, we will buyback shares!"" Good try Target, we are not dumb and we cannot afford it after Congress reject another stimulus plan for everyone!"
Kelly said covids over lol news much?
"What took me so long to take this one seriously? Clicked the 1 month, wow.6 months, wow1 year, wow5 year, wow! What's not to like? Growth, personified."
holding 350K short 265-267 along with my weekly 270 puts i'll sell back to chic at $3k per contract by friday
"today Jul 27, $TGT will be dumped by 1%"
Will share price surpassed Walmart's? I'm crossing my fingers.
"TGT blows away earnings as expected. This company has had monstrous performance over the last several years, easily outperforming its peers. Valuation is no object for me, this company has proven to be immune to e commerce."
Cramer just nailed it. Said target had great comps and a wonderful quarter and is stomping the competition but the CEO didn’t know how to deliver the news
Tried to get the stock 245 premarket and they shot it right up :((
lol
"Kelly's my financial advisor, I'm up 250k to date thanks bud!!! lol"
"Target remains under appreciated compared to Wmt and Cost. The pe is about 19 Wmt and Cost much higher. Also Tgt offers the most favorable growth. Walk into any Tgt store and everything is clean bright and organized. It is just a matter of time before Tgt gets a pe of 25 and then earnings will be $20 so a lot of growth ahead, best value stock out there."
this is why I abhor day traders. tgt was up over $4 a share a few hrs ago and then under $2 hours later. I see this far too often. we who do not day trade take longer to make a profit. just saying.......
"shorted 1000 shares at 265.30 on top of my 270 puts for next week, thanks chic!"
260 this week ?
Look at TGT rally!!! I expect record breaking earnings this week!!! GO TGT GO!!!
"TGT is the best kept retail secret out there. Watch it pop just prior to the 19th, divvy and after earnings."
Support level around the corner. That should be interesting.
Way overbought..due for huge pullback
Way overbought..huge pullback coming
"Looks like the same scenario as yesterday with home depot,Great numbers, but not good enough for the street.So Ill ask this question,If the street is so smart why did they put expectations higher than where they know they should be?They couldn’t see that last year was covid driven?Shouldnt they expect numbers to be a little lower after a period of panic shopping?Or are they just setting up a profit for their hedge fund buddies?Whatever,It is what it is,It should be a good buying opportunity.After HD got hammered yesterday the upgrades came pouring in at 3:45.Gotta love this job."
Can anyone explain why Target's beta is relatively high compared to competitors? Is this because of its recent expansion/remodeling/innovation project?
you're rough Chiclit...!
"News that TGT is testing ""flow center"" to improve backroom efficiency is good to hear, although I am surprised this wasn't done years ago. Large backrooms are at thing of the past in retail and I expect TGT to roll this out chain wide fairly rapidly once they've worked all the kinks out. This will result in additional distribution centers around the country, but will be well worth the investment. Good to see TGT being smart. Full disclosure... Long term investor with no plans to sell my TGT shares. I personally feel there's a good chance AMZN will make a play to acquire TGT at some point as well, but not the reason I'm holding. I'm a long term holder of AMZN shares as well."
Happy New Year Target stock team. Looking forward to new highs in 2020!
Not concerned one bit about the profit taking! Glad investors got out at these prices. Targets diverse and growing business model will rival Amazon in the next 5-10 years. Holding long and strong!
Just hope it stays this low so I can buy premarket at 7am!!!
What a fantastic job of competing with Amazon while other retailers failed! Managements share buyback and dividend program has been remarkably well balanced.
Target clobbers earnings!!! Buy the dip!!! Wow!!! 15billion buyback!!!
"--Analyst Actions: DA Davidson Lifts Price Target on Target Corp. to $150 From $145 on Online Sales, Reiterates Buy/Add Rating"
"I am still sticking to my prediction last month of TGT to $120 by earnings. This is a buying opportunity sub 110. Once WMT reports earnings on Thursday, you will have to pay a lot more for a share of TGT"
I just bought more shares of TGT on this dip!!! Easy Money!!! GO TGT GO!!!
early Christmas more shares cheap
"Without any underlying bad news or unusual trade volumes, dips are buying opportunities IMO. Stores are packed, stimulus, employee retention, omnichannel humming along and great management. Unless I hear otherwise I’m buying the dips like I did again yesterday. Good luck to all."
Ain’t no stopping TGT now. Productive Millennials love the store! It’s well managed well stocked with safe sustainable products and very well priced! Online business is icing on the cake! Bye bye amazon
this is overbought short term.....200 by years end.
"chic i know you need some help , so if you have to buy something buy WMT after earnings it will pop to $165 to $177"
"Solidly run company. Survived the pandemic and transition to online/curbside. Once everyone ready to go out again, the stores will be flooded due to the good in-store experience. Price should continue trajectory in coming year(s)."
"It has been a long long time since I posted here. I remember when TGT was in the 50s and 60s, and the bashers were out in full force saying Target would crash because of the transgender bathroom issue. Bashers and nay sayers never ever learn their lesson. Here we are a couple of years later, and TGT is at 237. Amazing!! Good job longs."
Some people don't or are unable to read financial statements.
I have 3 friends that also have an interest in individual stocks. We 'try' to get together a couple times a month. Last got together on March 5th. Told them I opened a position in target in my HSA & IRA on March 2nd & added more on the 4th. None of them were impressed. I'm up 16.00% :)
"profit takers today, not. to worry, it's back to school and everyone has money..next stop $300"
AMZN sell retail from Target stores seems too good to be true. Win for both companies and the public.
infrastructure bill passes targets soaring
but but back to school shopping lol!
Open $265 today ...
Goldman upgrades Target after earnings and places TGT on their conviction list! Target is seeing great growth in their e sales and should be on everyone’s buy list as full year guidance maintained. No effects of COVID!
Talk about nonsense coming from the talking heads on TV. TGT vs WMT....40% YTD vs 4%....How about valuation? No mention of valuation....TGT still less expensive than WMT.....by a lot.
Still overbought
"how my 260-265 puts looking, kenny?"
"$DG purchases are typically the ""hey, I need a quick set of jumper cables... loaf of bread... pack of bottled water... but I don't feel like driving all the way to $TGT or $WMT"". The ""big city"" guys don't understand the Dollar General shopper -- they're not competing with $AMZN in any way whatsoever compared to the likes of Walmart and Target. I'm not afraid of Walmart's numbers... to some extent, I can see Dollar General doing even better in a down economy. This is a good company with a great future. It owns rural America and the forgotten side of the city."
Awesome beat with buy back icing. $270+ today
CNBC financial news Target boosts earnings and the stock gets HAMMERED ! lol..
going to 5000 today
"i buried chic today 6 feet under, he wont be missed..."
TGT going to be in trouble soon. I went into 2 Targets over the weekend. Shelves were bare and freezers were empty. Not good if there having issues with supply chain. A lot of retailers are going to be affected by this
245 going to hold ?

"When I’ve had a bad day I need to remember to head to the yahoo message boards, where people provide sound technical investing advice by analyzing bathrooms. Seriously I’m laughing so hard right now, are you real humans or investors or are we being punked by kids on these message boards?"
"We all knew this would happen especially when AMZN and PYPL started dropping , buy WMt instead much cheaper"
holding strong on a red day
"I bought in at 248.49. I would say that is a pretty good purchase. I didn't know it would go into the 247's, but I am happy."

"The great thing about Target @ $217.xx? Thinking long term, TGT is still a good value. Good luck TGT longs! It's my longest held stock, since 1998, with no plans to sell. Hope to own for the next 20+ years in fact."
"$BARK is a winner. It has everything and more, that dog  owners need for its dogs. Moreover, unlike $woof Bark doesn't use bricks and mortars. Huge savings on leases. In addition to recurring subscription, Bark sells its products at $TGT and on $AMZN.$Chwy went from $20 and trading at circa $75. Bark will get there as well. It is just matter of time and patience. I am certain they will add pet insurance as $TRUP. Just be patient. This is a winner. Buy as much as you can at this level."
Glad I bought more $TGT shares at the big drop on Tuesday. Now up $5 with optimism around WMT's earnings beat. Let's hope TGT crushes it. Hard to see otherwise. They're a better version of Walmart all around.
thanks Kelly for the reminder to pick up 500 shares on the cheap today lol
Strong numbers. Going to be huge for shareholders.
sad
"Ken, it's great that you're riding high and the air up there is euphoric. However, it's not wrong if people don't share your risks vs rewards view on investing, especially when it's their money is at stake because it's what is important to them - safety vs risks. Having conveyed that, your remarks are not helpful or offer any insightfulness in terms of why a bullish position is a good choice, not just because of the excellerated growth. At most, your words border precariously between bullying and mean spiritedness. It must be tiresome being a narcissistic bully all day... and everyday huh? How on Earth did your parents permitted you to live to adulthood?  No, I didn't ""thumb down"" any of your posts. Yes, I do have ownership in TGT for over 20 years... but I don't see how it's helpful to anyone if I am to troll other investors."
"Timing timing timing, the tutes and retail investors will be buying on the dips, short term it looks like it’ll get clobbered (though it makes no sense) give it till November and it’ll be making all time highs again (barring any meltdown of the market itself that is)"
This stock should be in the $100's. The chart looks so incredibly overbought.
Consider the fact that Walmart has a PE multiple twice that of Target and a far lower dividend yield.
Amazon that Lowe’s reports numbers that are similar to target and the stock is up 6 right now!! Market is funny
Kramer seems to be right dmwt lol 200 yet lol
Target had roughly 874 million shares outstanding in 2005. Today less than 500 million.

"why do stocks fall on good news? I don't own any shares of target, but what is the point of selling after the good news, why not sell before?"
Everything looks positive for TGT. Short term the market is hard to predict. But it really looks good as a long term hold to me.
One of the best back to school play. Doubled my position along with NKE.
241 level buy
Be Careful Chic this can easily go to $227 in 2 weeks
"$SQ I think a lot of you are forgetting that Cash App users also tend not have banking accounts which is why their engagement stepped up in 2020 due to pandemic stimulus checks. You know what also just started? Monthly Child Tax Credit payments. If you use Cash App you get to use the money quicker and those parents will be using the card to buy clothes, school supplies, and groceries. Bullish for $TGT too."
Love how stock got upgraded last week with price target of $260!!!!
"i just purchased 21 of the 270 puts for 12.50 a piece chicybabe, i'll sell them back to you at $3k by next friday, thanks so much!"
"Sarah and Texas are really out of their gourds today, somehow trying to conflate a random incident in a Target dressing room with the bathroom policy. I guess they couldn't find any more bathroom anecdotes, so they have to resort to this."
TGT is rallying big!!! GO TGT GO!!!
Today was a gift. I think premarket we are 258-260
Bought in at $80.... sold at $110.... Never bought back in after that.Some of my biggest mistakes have been selling stocks too early.
I remember the days when this TGT was trading at $267. Wait! that was 9 days ago before great earnings and a $15b buyback. Wondering if it is profit taking and options expirations because down $22 in less than 9 days is seems a bit overdone.
CEO - Brian Cornell is so positive!!! Nice to see!!!
"so since 95% of my target stock was bought in the 100's Kelly calls me a dmmy! what did he do? nothing, the dmmy is in the puddin, puddin! looks like you're the real dmmy, dmmy for not buying long ago! lol"
"If you got caught holding the bag, just be patient and wait for it to fill up again."
cramer said to buy this at the top last night after a 50% run lol!
"I done reading the panic media, hit Target, Walmart, Sprouts and Trader Joes, Target and Walmart were literally SOLD OUT of many things, sales will be huge for the quarter."
I'm looking for a run to $300 and then a three for one split heading into the new year.Great company!
Congratulations to long term TGT investors!!!
Way overbought
TGT will finish strong today!
Congrats longs!
They had some interesting insights about TGT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Are people running out money for retail shopping overall or are they just moving to offline market?
will this keep going up or get corrected?
"Perfect, in the middle of market mental breakdown the fed has to open their yap and pile on today.I said it yesterday, This is a good week for tee times, but don’t worry, next week all will be right with the world. Insanity on display."
"Reviewed TGT's earnings and while they missed on the bottom line, I was actually pretty thrilled overall. Traffic in stores was up quite nicely, most in a decade. Spending on remodels and e-commerce crimped margins, impacting bottom line, but will drive sales and profits longer term which is what I care about. Grocery improvements in remodeled stores is substantial. Not surprised with the 6% drop, but my thesis stays the same and I plan to hold for many years to come. Good luck TGT longs..."
my 260 puts will look good at 230 kenny
TGT Q2 earnings will be huge
I got to do my happy dance because of this stock today! Congrats to all the $TGT longs!  Have a wonderful weekend y'all!
They are going to buy bak some stocks so what is going to happen to this price? LOL wait and find out

EOD - one would think this would come back up $2-3-4 the night before earnings?
"Earnings growth again, should be a green quarter! Back to school is often awesome!"
Target now offering education assistance like WMT. Talk about inflation. What will it cost them if people take them up on the offer?
"Target still rated a strong buy, many retailers down today including Costco, Home Depot, Ulta. Retail sales numbers out on Friday were down significantly to consensus, just selling off a little today with the holiday yesterday. When the $1.9 trillion gets approved and stimulus goes out, batten down the hatches, this will hit $225 in no time."
target...busy beaver....
Abysmal. Not selling a share though.
"hey chic my 270 puts are almost at that $3K/contract i told you i'd sell them to you now, you interested?"
Kohl's and Home Depot not looking good. But Target is no Kohl's. Our Kohls is nearly always empty in contrast Target is almost always packed.
green
+40% ytd ran too hard
"Pete Najarian was on CNBC this morning and was asked to pick 3 stocks for 2020. $TGT Target was one of them & he too argued that Target deserves a higher multiple than Walmart. He also believes Target will achieve that multiple. He is also a big believer in Cornell, especially what he has built with Target Online. Take it for whats its worth to you. This is not what i base my investment decisions off of, but opinions like this are always appreciated on my end."
"how my 250-255 puts looking, ken?"
TGT > amazon
"We shopped at TGT today, it was full of people, hard to walk."
Heard on CNBC some saying if you buy online it’s really between Walmart and Amazon. Don’t know about everyone else but I have as many Target boxes on my porch as anything else. I don’t think their digital sales were a one-hit wonder. I expect any day Target to announce their strong digital sales continued through June and stock pops 5-7% on the news.Would love to hear others opinions. I see $130 ish range after earnings and $150+ by year-end.
This stock is still undervalued with a PE of 20.61.

"Gonna be a rough day. Nothing to do with the business structure, but everything to do with global uncertainty. Hopefully this blows over... but if futures stay down for a while, it may be a good time to add!"
"Target recently announced it will invest $4 billion a year for several years to accelerate its shift to e-commerce. The company's focus on revamping its stores to serve more as fulfillment centers for online orders was well under way before Covid-19 hit. It is working to regain market share lost to online retail giant Amazon (AMZN).

"Analyst with upgrades. bAC takes price target to $317, GS target to $281, CS takes the price to $286. Raymond James increases target to $285. Davidson moves to $285. Citi increases price to $287. So there it goes 6 price target increases this AM."
Doesn’t target always beat? Wal Mart just released ER and its soaring. Target is a lock if I ever saw one 
TGT this is it for you...4 years ago you were at $48.90 yesterday $248.40 will get under $200 by EOM $150 EOY ! Nice run TGT but it's over for you and the lemmings that bought u...lol
All time highs just keep rolling along for this great company. Target treats its shareholders and employees exceptionally well and grows profits as well AAA+++
Target had a stellar quarter. You are getting a BIG discount at this price.
next top $200!
Close stores in bad areas like San Francisco that has terrible law enforcement
We tried warning you CHIC the poor guy lol ! They bought TGT for the dividend and now after earnings it will have the same fate as HD down 5% minimum...poor CHIc he is learning
i'll sell you bagholders my 270 puts at $3000/contract today
Earning leaked! Stock going higher ahead of ER!!
Buy the PEAK! Inflation will not bring buyers!!!
Enroute to $300 easy
PE Ratio of 10 and a 4% dividend coming out of a great holiday season? I will be parking a few thousand shares in Target.
Great earning beats ...plus 15B buy back is awesome ...should finish on the 5% green today or above $ 270 after opening.
Dump it boys and girls. Way overvalued
I love TGT but you better run. I was in at 140 and took the ride BUT go to a store and look at their shelves or look on their App. Inventory issues are getting serious l. They are out of so many products. No way that does not hurt revenue. I had to go back to Amazon sellers. Look for yourself and visit a store and you will sell
Only 36% of eps is going to pay the dividend. 4 billion/year for the next 4 years to improve business. I am buying the dips for passive retirement income off the dividend. This is a solid company and should be in everyone’s portfolio long term. I would love to see the dividend raised but I do like their business plan. GLTA longs!!
"Amazon is down, customers go back to shop at store,TGT 's $180 is coming."

Is anyone else surprised that TGT is at $191 with a relative strength index of 55? Is TGT headed to a quarter grander?
"Target is a winner for sure in all economic climates,thus we could see 250 per share by end of summer....300 by years end...then maybe 5 for 1 stock split. I’m off to to Target to buy some stuff right now!"
"dont tell chic ""the pumper"" about those 6000 weekly 260 calls dumped today at 5.55 bid either he might figure it out lol!"

BINGO trading in the high 247's did i call it or what ???
"I ordered something from Target.com using their new 2-day delivery option (mainly to test it out). Order was placed on Friday at 11 am local time. The system said that the item will be delivered by Tuesday but it was in my mailbox on Saturday. Interestingly, it was shipped from my local Target store using regular USPS mail (cheapest shipping option). Looks like Target is able to compete with Amazon Prime without charging an yearly fee because they are using their stores, rather than distribution centers, to fill orders... probably not all orders, but most orders."

TGT is Fantastic!
Any idea why the drop this morning? I could find no bad news.
good earnings and it goes down???
"Lol, they say the stock is down because the company announced that they will spend $4 b..."
112% gain in one year is pretty nice.
Just added to my position.
Kudos to the people that sold at 267 and bought back in now.
Short this with ease
"Few companies can nail things like customer experience and brand equity the way Target does. Whatever household item you need, just pick it up around the corner. You don't have join a club and buy a crate of it. You can hold the item in the store instead of waiting for a drone to drop it on your steps. And you don't feel like you had to walk through the town cesspool for that 39 cent rollback. Just shop at Target like a normal person. Simple."
"Small pullback no big deal, it's healthy. Even if it dropped 10%"
This should get a bump of $5 tomorrow before earnings.
"""Clobbers estimates"" then falls 3.5%"
TGT announced very profitable smaller store format reinforced that fact the strategy of providing convenience to customers is working in a buzzing city like New York. It appears short squeeze is happening and squeezing hard. Still needs 7 days to cover.
"Barron's has an article about COST, that it should be every investor shopping cart. The PE is 31 vs TGT 19, TGT is growing faster than COST, and their online sales are growing much faster as well. Costco has 785 stores vs about 1900 for TGT. TGT has a lot more potential than Costco because of the location and the expansion they can do."
Hit the bottom. Thanks guys for give me some of your money.
Target appears to be the bullseye for a selloff today after a good ER.
"Holding strong, earnings were great, this was a massive disappointment to wake up to but you don’t lose anything if you don’t sell. Dividend keeps me patient."
Ending the day green. Easily
Not hard to see why this stock will continue to rise just by regularly visiting Target. $200+ here we comes.
TGT beating AAPL performance since 2014. 269 vs 248.
anyone seen the resident pumper? broke already?
"In my opinion based on WMT current share price, TGT is a great potential near term short play. Liking some put plays going into next week's earnings. We shall see, but for now I'm long wmt and short tgt. Good luck in your trades."
Recent share decline seems overly pessimistic for such a blue chip retailer - I just bought my first block at under $114!
"Wow, $15B buyback. This will close minimum 5% in green mark my post. GL"
I just opened a large position in TGT. Great value after the sell off recently and I always regret not having any going into earnings. Predicting big things! Over 200 before earnings arrives easily.
Chic LOL
"This is a $300 stock compared to Walmart and Costco. It reminds of when Apple had such a low pe and then getting into services it's pe rose now comparable to it's peers. With earnings of $12+, a pe of 25 is quite reasonable so I think it will grow into it's real worth ."
"i just got done burying chiclit, he will be missed..."
Just heard it on CNBC >>>>>>> TGT is the next meme stock !!! What has this world come to ????
 Go baby go! Enjoy the ride longs! Have a wonderful Independence Day weekend everyone! 
back to school means mega profits lol
If kids go back to school TGT will fly.
Stock buybacks??!
300 gang?
That's a big $21 haircut. Should bottom out soon. That's a big hit to take for a company that has done really well and has a great forecast.
Massive breakout underway. It officially broke out today. Expect to see new highs before the week is over
Heading to 225 fast
230 here we go! 250-255 puts in play!
YOY 2021 to 2022 post pandemic what are the guesses for a sales decline? 5% 10% 15% 20%?
I'm not a fan of the Ulta shop in shop. it's starting to remind me of department stores. We all know how those are doing.
"I’ve been tracking my wife’s spending here for years. Her frequency in the store, 1-3x per week. Target is like a lifestyle store, much more relevant to many than an average store."
short short short the free money is drying up.
"Target is doing something rather interesting. Here in Miami they are testing 2 smaller stores, one of which is a former Office Depot location. I was there yesterday. I think TGT wants to position CVS-size stores (slightly bigger) every half-mile or so. Presence. Presence. Presence."
"shorted another 500 shares at 267, will cover next week at 240"
Pullback way overdue..240 is on the way
don't worry I've made money today already lol
Ken you are riding a strong and popular stock. Good for you. But it’s just a matter of time that they announce a slowdown in growth and earnings and this stock goes back under $200. It’s tough to fight the momentum though.
Nice reading about the expanding of Target's Disney store partnership this morning. This will continue to increase foot traffic and sales. This management team seems to have made all the right moves the past couple of years. I feel this is a great opportunity to buy TGT here on the recent pullback from 267. Earnings were very good. Leadership is great. Future looks very bright for them.
32% dividend increase. I was expecting 80 cents per quarter. They made it 90
"People on Wall Street love to mislead, even lie to people. My post on share count reduction on a 15 billion buyback keeps getting deleted by some here. 15 billion authorized at an average price of 245 could lead to a reduction in shares outstanding of roughly 60 million shares. There are roughly 494 million shares of TGT. That is a possible 12% reduction which would offset YOY sales declines."
Analyst at BofA reiterates $260 price target!!
"...and Target quietly hit a new 52 week high. Great company, great stock!"
"This is the best stock in the market. It’s green 8 days out if 10, pays a dividend, has a low PE, is COVID-safe. What’s not to love?"
Low 240s on way
$15BN IN SHARE REPURCHASES IS ENOUGH SECURITY FOR ME.BUY BIUY BUY!GO TGT!
Grab before $260
I work there and have seen how its been transforming 350 is realistic in a year from now. SHIPT AQUISITION WAS BRILLIANT ORDER PICUP SMARTORDER ONLINE PICK UP IN STORE OOPUIS TARGET ALSO HAS THERE OWN STORE BRAND BATTERYS AND CASES AND SPEAKERS AND FOOD ITEMS AND GENERIC PHARMACY STUFF AS WELL AS BEUTY PRODUCTS LONG TGT ALSO MILFS
Here's to all the $TGT longs! Cheers! 
"I was looking at the chart, 2 years ago this was an $88 stock over 250% growth."
With Wmt up after earnings I would expect Tgt to report even better numbers tomorrow morning. I see the stock price going up to $220 or better tomorrow when their earnings are reported bmo.
Heading to low 250 range..trade wisely
"Earnings blowout coming! Living in Minneapolis, I go to Target for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it is always crowded! :) It is literally people's source of entertainment day to day...no joke"
"Walmart earnings good, tgt will be the same next week"
Buying opportunity. Yes bathrooms unsafe sell your shares to me at discount thank you
here's Kelly after earnings
kelly lol
the echo chamber on 40% YTD is classic talking heads
John Kelly
I don't know why people keep saying why is TGT so high. Its got a forward PE 22. That's not bad at all when you compare it to most growth stocks. Its easily going to $300
I bought in at a discount of $10. Thanks hedgies for running this through everybody's stops.
going to 270 today
300 TGT price
went shopping last night spent a ton with all my profits lol Kelly lol
how could've bought at the top if I'm up over 100k dmwt. MATH MUCH? LOL
Watch the investors pile in today and Monday to get the Div/earnings beat next week
CFRA maintains strong buy. 12 month target now $300. First upgrade. Really just upgraded price target higher. Maybe other analysts will follow? Ugly close.
"congrats Tgt longs. I sold at this level last year, and think it can go higher, wish it would go back down to $100 so I could get back it, but doesn't look that way."
filling up with target
"WMT rocked earnings today, and TGT will rock their earnings tomorrow!!! GO TGT GO!!!"
Overbought still...
"I think TGT might be overbought at this point. This share price (up over 100% since March 2020) reflects the the unique pandemic condition that consumers were not able to spend their savings on services (travel, beauty, restaurants, recreation etc.) so they spent it on goods. Retailers like Target were big beneficiaries of this shift from services to goods but now with the reopening the pendulum could swing back resulting in less spending on goods. I anticipate a correction in the stock price accordingly and that's why I sold today."
"WOW, this company has been a great investment. The dividends relative to my purchase price are tremendous now, It just keeps going up! anyone see a split in the near future?"
"I'm right 95% of the time lol that's why I live in Bal Harbour, Johnny trailer lol"
Back to 242.
Targets massive PPS already baked into these earnings. Margins down and that trend will continue as sales slow with less economic stimulus. Pulls back from here.
"Looking forward to next earnings report and their forward guidance. My Target is almost always crowded and the store is very clean. Knowledgeable and helpful staff, great deals throughout the store. Christmas season numbers were great so I’m optimistic the quarterly numbers will be as well. Dividend ex date is coming up so a nice little rally up to that would be nice too."
"Used target as an example for estimating fair price of stocks in our class today using ebitda and average enterprise value/PE; we got fair value at 282 when we used comparable like Walmart, Costco, Walgreens, the dollar store, etc. I wanna stresss it was only an example but seems fair value ?"
Good buying opportunity
$246.25 was a very strong buy!!!!
"I work at a TGT and I'm bullish on the stock long term, but this year's BF traffic was way down. Not sure if the new BF hrs for this year had anything to do with it. Hoping for high ecom sales."
chic getting run over like usual buying tops
"240 incoming, RSI 90 lol"
$258.80 coming soon.
target
"Cowen analysts led by Oliver Chen said Target (TGT) has momentum in both its stores and online and expect it to accelerate.""We believe a combination of improved value and messaging and compelling private brand innovation are resonating with shoppers and driving physical store traffic,"" the note said.Cowen rates Target (TGT) stock as outperform with a $100 price target."
Hedgies dropping this through everybody's stops so people like me can buy at a big discount.
"Target tops comparable sales estimates, sees no slowdown due to Delta variantAug. 18, 2021 7:01 AM ETTarget Corporation (TGT)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor3 Comments￼Scott Olson/Getty Images NewsNow Read: Stocks To Watch: Retailers Step Out And Tesla Talks AI3 CommentsShareRecommended For YouMore Trending NewsSee More »"
Was on my to Costco on Saturday to buy some outdoor chairs and stopped by Target to pick up an inexpensive long lounge chair for my wife to lay out on...I wound up buying all the outdoor stuff at Target(Great selection and lots of color!) and other stuff I wanted too. While walking back to the van I looked back at the store and parking lot and thought I have to check the stock price because this place is going to sell a lot of stuff! And that was before I saw the upgrade by Barlays. This is what Costco looked like right before it went from 204...straight up!
"I never said TGT could go to ZERO, TGT is a great company but it is very overbought and as you are seeing it has started a very sharp decline...$227 in a couple of weeks and i wouldn't buy it until high $170's"
Happy New Year everybody!  Looks like it's time to take stock and add $TGT shares to our portfolio today!
TGT had an amazing run but this stock will be trading in a $160 to $250 range over the next 4 to 5 years.
15 billion dollar buyback announced 
going red again haha added 252.5 puts thanks again KEN!
SELL it.
"Im sorry, Target stocket takes a 5% hit just because Amazon is doing free next day shipping? Give me a break! Target has next-day delivery from some of their stores as it is now. Buying opportunity....Target just had a nice 5% discount on their stock today. Happy Friday!!"
"There is no reason for this to be down with the quarter and year that TGT has had so far, plus the buy backs. It must just be profit takers, but this is headed towards $300. I wasn't in TGT at 267, but I bought the discount today."
Does anybody know why the big fall pre-market today after decent earnings report?
Watch for huge buy-ins during the power hour. This price is a great deal.
Not very ‘Woke” of them. Target closing San Fran stores early due to ‘rampant crime’…
