"OCAM a hedge fund owns over 6 million shares of ORI. They have contacted ORI's board asking the company to split into 2 businesses, change the board structure, and to take on more debt to fund stock repurchases. The Gordon Gekkos at OCAM need to go away. Now!!"
"The ORI response to Owl Creek -- which is available via Google -- is interesting, and it should add to any confidence that ORI is being effectively managed. I agree, they [i.e., OCAM] should just go away! Only a few days left until that nice divvy."
I have been invested in ORI for 5 yrs. I recieved 5 special divies total $5.50 and $4 regular divies. Bring my first investment base to about $9. added almost every time after special divy announcements.
Another special divi? Early Jan/Feb so taxpayers can plan. This is a cash printing business!
Happy dividend day!
"Anyone adding to their position at this level? My plan was to add below $23, but wondering if this overall market pull back still has a way to go."
$.79 and $2.21 B. ORI blew the socks off egs and rev...Congrats
Looks like a nice beat...79c vs 59c consensus estimate. What a great Company!
net earn 29 cent after 50 cents loss on investment. much better than I expected.
revenue looks good considering the unrealized loss in equities. good report so far..but more to read
Maybe a surprise in the conf call at 3ET....we'll see!
This was my 4th special dividend. Great company management.
Reflecting on the last 10 years with ORI: It has been a spectacular investment. I calculate 583% total return on an initial investment from 10/9/11 to now with dividends reinvested. For the S&P500 that same calculation shows 425% return.
Old Republic is up 4.97% to 25.15
"I have said this before: It is futile to try to make sense of directional moves with ORI. It does not respond to hype. It is not a MEME stock --- or for that matter, sexy at all. Look at the financials of this company and consider the long-time reliable dividends. At this point in time, it might be wise to hold cash aside for a buying opportunity. In general, the market has been stronger than I would have guessed; however, corporate tax overhauls will cut into the bottom line -- perhaps as much #$%$. Supply chain issues will affect the earnings in some sectors and weigh on the markets (honestly, I am shocked at how many things are not available right now, and you can't make $$$ with nothing to sell). And inflation is going to affect us in some form. We are going to be looking at some form of pull-back, and have some cash aside for when that happens. Personally, I plan to reach my portfolio goal with ORI with this next opportunity -- and I don't say this lightly, because I am a geezer and retirement is around the corner. Just my opinion."
ORI is below 52 wk high but that high was before $1.72 divies. Practically ORI set new high today.
the only downside is the cyclical nature of insurance. ORI is subject to years of underevaluation simply do to the nature of their business. The yield curve in growing interest rate environment could be problematic for their bond portfolio. As rates go up bond values go down. The real test of value is reserve adequacy and a combined ratio consistently under 100%.
Boom goes the dynamite!
"From the comments on the site I believe people are continuing to hold ORI. No one mentions selling now after the special dividend?I bought ORI a year ago. I bought it for the regular dividend and now I have received the special dividend..I think it was good luck rather then any investing skill and I think maybe I should sell and realize the gain.I believe their main business is property-casualty business? I'm not sure how risky that is?But there seems to be a number of reasons to hold. The p/e is still low, the regular dividend at current price is 3.5% and there is a possibility of more special dividends?"
"Great day for ORI. However, looking forward to 2022 and the likelihood of the feds raising rates, do you see ORI as vulnerable in that environment, or a hedge against the rate hike? Thoughts?"
