"The Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry is gaining from the upbeat commodity prices. This will help improve farm income and encourage farmers to spend on agricultural equipment that will support the industry in the days to come. Over the long term, rising population, and elevated global demand for food and efficient water use will fuel demand for the industry’s equipment. Moreover, investments in advancement of farming technologies, precision agriculture and smart farming solutions will spur growth.Upbeat Commodity Prices to Drive Farm Equipment DemandAgricultural commodity prices are gaining from a rising demand environment amid limited supply. Further, strong grain demand and supply constraints are likely to push commodity prices higher. Principal crop cash receipts in the United States are expected to increase in 2021 on higher commodity prices. These factors will boost farm income and encourage farmers to invest in farm equipment. Moreover, replacement demand for age-old equipment will keep spurring farm equipment demand in the near term.Last year, the industry grappled with waning demand and lower commodity prices due to the coronavirus pandemic. The livestock and dairy markets were hit hard due to the overall disruption of the food supply chain and changes in consumption patterns. Nevertheless, with several COVID-19 aid packages announced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA for U.S. farmers and livestock producers, the industry managed to sail through the crisis. Also, the Federal Government’s direct farm program payments through Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (""CFAP” provided assistance to farmers affected by market disruptions. This led to a surge in farm income by 44.2% in 2020 — the highest level since 2013.However, due to lower direct government farm payments in the current year, the USDA projects net farm income to decline 8.1% to $111.4 billion in 2021. Notwithstanding the decline projected this year, net farm income would still be 21% above its 2000-19 average of $92.1 billion.Technological AdvancementsCustomers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. The companies in the industry are now enhancing investments in precision farming and capabilities, in order to keep up with the evolving demands for agricultural equipment. Initiatives to expand in the precision agriculture technology will be a game changer for industry players.Pandemic-induced Uncertainty LingersThe pandemic has affected U.S. agricultural exports, which had already been reeling under the unfavorable impact of the U.S.-China trade spat. Per the U.S-China Phase one trade deal, China had pledged to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products by $32 billion over a period of two years. Though elevated exports to China over the last few quarters have boosted U.S. customer sentiment, it remains be seen whether or not China will be able to honor its terms of the agreement. Furthermore, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is a major concern as it might impact commodity prices again. Farmers will likely adopt a cautious stance regarding their spending on equipment.Industry PerformanceThe Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry has outperformed the sector and the S&P 500 over the past six months. Stocks in this industry have appreciated 41.8% compared with the Zacks Industrial Products sector’s growth of 17.3%, while the S&P 500 has gained 14.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research 4 Manufacturing - Farm Equipment Stocks Worth AttentionWe have picked four Farm Equipment stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy or 3 (Hold.

"Titan International (TWI) Misses Q4 EPS by 16c, Revenues MissTitan International (NYSE: TWI) reported Q4 EPS of ($0.21), $0.16 worse than the analyst estimate of ($0.05). Revenue for the quarter came in at $363.4 million versus the consensus estimate of $385.07 million."
up up up
couldnt help but to buy more here.
Is there any chance that any of these rampers could get a reddit social media frenzy going with Titan? thanks.
Gordy buying. he will dump it. lol
gordy says.....
Bought 250 more share today at $2.47It will come back . I lowered my buy to 3.25
do it now before 10% down tomorrow.
"1 hr MACD has rolled over, 2 is flat. I'm looking for 10.25 in a couple of days then I'm back in."
sell it now
buying this is...
just sold for profit. cheers
this is fun to watch tomorrow....
Gordy be like....
"The thing I find troubling is the fact that Deere who are supposed to be one of Titan's largest customers is booming, they are obviously aligned almost 100% to the agricultural sector. We have CAT seemingly doing well too. How come Titan are hit so badly from this market? seems like they are making excuses to me. The mining sector is doing great guns, I at least make good money trading here, I wonder why Titan doesn't? Thankfully, they are cutting costs, appears like they need to do much more. If ever this much hyped slowdown does appear, then this company could go down the pan."
soooo close...
buying this with Gordy is......
buying this.....
buying this now is....
Classic short squeeze
Trading over a hundred K in volume in the last 45 or so minutes before the close Friday and today. looks like somebody's snatching it up when It goes on sale is only thing I can guess.
"Is TWI one of those stocks that could be moving up due to the Robinhood effect? A lot of newer, younger investors are looking to make a quick buck, and Robinhood is their investment platform of choice. Low priced stocks allow them to purchase more shares, and with limited investing funds, this combination can be a good way to make money. Thoughts?"
i cn smell blood monday
Gordy pump?
this pig will dive 100%
There could be a cash squeeze coming
enjoy Gordy. lol
sell... Gordy is back
"I just listened to the Q2 earnings conference call to see if anything terrible was said to justify the huge drop in the stock price. I didn't hear anything that folks couldn't have guessed beforehand. Ag market is questionable, raw materials (steel and synthetic rubber, etc.) are up, dollar strength is a headwind. They do seem to be in a bind in that tariffs don't impact competitors' tire imports into US now, but input costs are up due to tariffs for this US manufacturer. But it seems that we could have figured all this out before today. My guess is that the company will have some struggles until the tariff issue is resolved.I wasn't very impressed with the performance of the management team on the call. They didn't seem to be on top of things as much as I would have expected, and were vague in answering some questions that I would have expected a crisp answer to. Maybe they are playing it close to their vest, or maybe things are ugly and they don't want to put hard numbers on it.Nonetheless. I bought today, after seeling out of a rather large position (for me) in 2017. I think 30& down is an over reaction, especially considering lots of the bad news wasn't a surprise. I think if the tariff issue goes away at some point (Trump's stated goal), or at least things get dialed back abit, then this stock could rocket up. But how long that takes, or if things get worse and not better, then I'll have to take my lumps. In th einterim, I'll be patient."
take your profit and.....
gordy must be happy. his pappy is.....
just.....
you think about buying this....
"This company is surely destined for bankruptcy, right?"
"Chairman just purchased 171,589 shares this MONTH for a total worth of $520,053 worth of stock. Same time last year same board member purchased $720,000 worth of stock still holding all of the shares totaling $1,240,053 worth of stock still holding 702,889 shares."
gordyguy will dump this one.
lol.... have a nice weekend...
sold all my position..... glta
"FYI - Relating to the wash sale rules, remember that the loss is incurred on the ""trade date"" if you are selling a long-term position, while the loss is incurred on the ""settlement date"" if you are selling a short-term position."
"The Russian LOI is interesting. They are in fact paying more than under the option, but obviously not in under rated TWI stock. The payment puts a value of $500m on Voltyre so TWI's 50% is worth $250m. No idea of any actual numbers for the plant but ISTR that they paid $90m originally. This compares to a present market cap for the whole of TWI of $284m."
buy buy buy guys..... give me more money 
gordy be like.....
sell before Gordy dump it.......
gordyyyyyyyyyyyy...... lol
this will.....
Titan is up 12.61% to 1.25
Tractor sales is strong - Nice... I think it will continue this year. Titan go.https://www.aem.org/AEM/media/docs/Statistics/20-5-USAG.pdf
Bit of a shame there are bashers on this thread. Only reason they spend so much time bashing a stock is to try and get the price lower so they can buy in. Any one who has any sense knows this.Their time would be better spent getting a ramping thread going on reddit.
if I were you.....
gordyguy is hiding.........
Sold all tech and bot into TWI... Future is bright and Company has been doing fantastic other than hiccup on earnings with currency issues. See you all at $10.00 shortly.
this will dive...
this stock is like Gordyguy's Papa. lol
everything.....
sell before its too late.....
wait tomorrow for pull back. 100%.... Gordy will dump as always. cheers!
"just broke above a bull pennant.... if the volume comes in like it has been, we should have a nice afternoon here..."
Titan is up 13.91% to 1.31
paps il visit you soon. lol

Just bought some! Hoping for a bounce to the high 9s...that looks to be the next resistance point... from a technical standpoint. GLTA!
dont listen to gordyguy .....
"does anybody understand the russian put? did they not buy the entire thing? so the minority partners can out the remaining equity to TWI? its about $100m - that is all of their cash - they can do stock, but that's a big dilution - do we even want this russian voltyre thing? why brazil and russia? are there any synergies with global manufacturing / distribution? I wouldn't think so....."
"TWI appears to be chewing through cash and with farmers in a pinch, and global mining not fully recovered will lead to challenging financials Any insights on the Russian operation?"
watch out for this stock....
gordy guy?
worst stock ever. im done. sell3x
Just crossed the 50 can we get the 20?
Finally hit $10+ on very strong volume.. Congrats longs.
too much short here. good thing i sell.
"Revenue is down slightly, but costs are down and profit is up. Just a little bit of an over reaction. Most of this is no doubt due to the Russian PUT and the possible disposal of chassis division. They might list the operation on a European exchange. You never know, we might see Titan Europe relisted."
gordy mde good money on this. 
i sold everything yesterday..... thanks for this board. i save a lot of money.....
Titan is up 15.25% to 3.25
I am buying 2k more shares. This giant drop is completely unjustified.
where is gordy guy......
this will dive as Gordy pumping it...lol
sell and thank me later
disaster.......
invest with caution. this management....
buying twi
disaster
sell before its too late.......
lol
Gordy guy is an......
"TWI is in a slow death spiral due to bad Morry decisions. Bryan OH factory is a disaster for OTR tires. TWI has three tire factories in the US that could easily go to two. Plus they have the old GY factory in Union City to make cow mats! Russia is a disaster since it does not focus on radial tires. The recycling center was a gift in $$ from Morry to his brother in Rome GA for the technology. Rietz kicked out all of the smart people and now has a bunch of yes men that report to him. Titan actually showed well at recent farm shows with the LSW, but sunk fixed costs are going to kill them in the end."
"if you want a good return on your investment. dont follow Gordy. he is manipulator with a lot of aliases. move your money on clean energy. (ev, solar and enegy storages). this is the future. trust me. you will be happy. cheers "
"From Ag Equipment Intelligence: ----""The Purdue/CME Agricultural Economy Barometer for March showed a 2% increase in the number of farmers who planned to purchase more equipment than last year while those farmers who expected to purchase fewer pieces of equipment declined by 35% from the March 2020 report."" ----Also: YTD Tractor sales......<40hp-30% above estimates.....40to100hp-18% above estimates..... 100+hp-21% above estimates ..... Combines-2% below estimates."

"I'm seeing signals of a retracement to either 9.60 or 9.35 depending on where you set the points, but the volume is so low today....idk what to make of it."
sell now. thank me later
"Gordy,be like...."
that's it!
Titan is down 7.64% to 8.46
sell before pothead gordy will steal your hard earned money... its gonna be blood once he started dumping this one.
im back to help you. sell before my friend dump it.
watch out on this play......
"I'm not sure what to expect out of Q4. U.S./Canada ag equipment sales are up 9%+ yoy for the fifth month in a row but I don't know what percentage of TWI sales are from this region. Half of their revenue is from ag equipment so that has to be good, but with steel hitting all time highs, oil rallying, and the cost of sales already 90% of revenue, I'm not sure they can pass that on as well as I'd like.What am I missing here guys?"
run and never look back. this stock is disaster..... be cautious 
sell now
Higher Lows....... we will slowly be turning around folks. Hope to have a Merry Christmas to all.
sell now take your gain
oppps....
"i miss gordy ""the pumper here and basher there"". hope his dad is doing well. cheers....."
sell before its too late....
dump it now
gordy....
Take a look at insider buying history. This may be an indication of management sentiment towards price movement. Watch the options carefully. I have owned shares for many years and endored the pain of a mismanaged company.
Titan is up 11.97% to 1.31
sell before they dump this one
This has officially bounced.. Congrats if you got in at $2.40 area. These nice dips come around every few years.
John Deere trading at all time high levels due to expectations they are doing well out of the covid issue. The new design for remote monitored tractors seems to be in demand. Titan looks like it could be getting the knock on effect. Just hope they can live up to expectations.
gordy guy is an.....
"Titan up today, while the rest of the sector is down. So, maybe the upcoming results might indeed be better than expected. I rather suspect they have a sale in the pipeline. They need to do something to generate cash as their managemnet style is clueless."
The long awaited ag upcycle is here. Buy TWI and the other Titan TITN.
gordy be like...... lol
Just based on EV this thing should be trading at about $15.50. I'll note that the MACD and fib retracement trades are looking favorable too... should be a good week.
i told you guys... thank me if you sold. we will be back @ 7.30 cheers
this board is toxic. stay away. save your money.....
all you need to do is.....
its time
how do you know Gordyguy?
buying twi?
Titan is up 6.67% to 9.19
"oh,yeah Gordy. daddy,is, waiting"
"im worried about this shorts flooding...  planning to sell tomorrow, thoughts?"
buy this?
best option monday
never look back
gords. lol
The chip crisis has dashed the hopes of Titan's customers for a post-pandemic sales recovery. Analysts have now dialed back their forecasts as the semiconductor shortage continues into the second half of 2021. A return to normal supply and demand isn't expected now until the second half of 2022 (which I had openly surmised here previously).
"Since the 22nd of January, we've been trading pretty tightly around a baseline of 175% the 200 EMA... which today would be right at 10.20. The 2 and 4 hour MACD charts look positive, but the 1 hour is signaling a slow down tomorrow. We really need some volume when we retest the last high of 10.62 or I'll be looking for a rollover to the downside, or at least an extended period of consolidation sideways... then again, that's only my technical analysis. If they knock earnings out of the park it's a different ballgame."
buying this now?
dump it now before lossing half of your investment.
its not too late
@gladiator Are you still holding this?
buying this now is......
"So, they have done a deal with RDIF for $25m in cash and $25m in deferred shares. Thing I don't understand is, what was RDIF share holding in Voltyre-prom initially, because the statement reads to me as; if Titan do not buy the shares back from RDIF within 12 months, then RDIF don't give away any shareholding.If anyone could put me right on this, I would be very grateful. Thanks."
Titan is up 11.48% to 1.36
"good thing i sold last,week. glta.,cheers.."
Titan is up 15.59% to 1.97
where is gordy? looks like something happened to him. hope he is doing fine. i like the way he pump here and bash there with his 5 aliases. hope his papa is doing good too. lol
"sold everything, lastweek...."
too risky.
im done. thank you...
gordy pumping....
gordy.......
Looks like Gordy got out at the right time
"Financial ConditionNet cash used for operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $36.2 million, compared to $1.3 million for prior year. While net income has improved in the current year, net sales growth required significant additional working capital to meet ongoing demand for the Company's products. Capital expenditures were $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $32.6 million for the prior year.The Company ended the year ended December 31, 2018 with total cash and cash equivalents of $81.7 million. Long-term debt at December 31, 2018, was $409.6 million, compared to $407.2 million at December 31, 2017. Short-term debt was $51.9 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $43.7 million at December 31, 2017. Net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) was $379.8 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $307.3 million at December 31, 2017, as cash decreased during 2018 due to the previously mentioned growth requiring additional working capital."
This is a dead stock going forward. Multiple CFO's tells the story like Sears. Dead stock due to mainly high costs of keeping 4 tyre factories running when only 2 are needed. Bryan is literally a warehouse since no more mining tyres being built. Freeport running at low capacity. Titan recycling never mentioned again despite millions to Morry's brother in GA and cost of factory itself.LSW is nice but not enough volume. Trelleborg will take over for Goodyear despite TWI having wheel business. CEO cannot make big decision on cost cutting - probably why CFO's left shortly after joining. Funny how the griz is never heard from anymore!
i think twi is worst stock to hold......
"Ag Equipment Intelligence April sales numbers..... Up to 40hp- 30073 units, 33% MoM increase; 40 to 99hp -7718 units, 21% MoM increase; 100+hp- 2289 units, 23% MoM increase; combines- 487 units, 25% increase MoM....... still heading in the right direction."
"worst stock ever. was a,pump and dump. be cautious. save your money and invest wisely."
"The Deere strike, which began at midnight last night at all 14 US plants, will have a painful effect on Titan if it goes on for an extended period of time."
to the moon gordy. lol
buying this?
Someone or insider just bought 19k in afterhours at 7.90. This is on half of average volume and typically single digits in after hours trading. This may be a good time to take some profits but not all.
sell before gordy take your money.
"Great market leverage, the prices should move up"
gordyyyyy.... lol
Argus Research new price target $2
gordy enjoy. lol
buying this......
selling is the best option for now
buying this is
thank you ism sold everything last friday. glta.
"I presume they have opted for the share issue because there is little chance of it being approved and certainly not in the time limit. If they paid cash, which they could borrow, they wouldn't need government approval so won't do that. I would expect Morry to tell the Russians if they actually want to sell their shareholding then it would be for a much lesser sum than $70m, otherwise they can keep them.TWI is heavily geared to N American farming incomes and will bolt once they recover. It was doing quite nicely till Trump decided to shove tariffs on steel and all the repurcussions from that on farming incomes and TWI costs. Hopefully something can be salvaged from this trade war debacle. I would expect the next president, or a replacement if it comes to that, to scrap the tariff war."

"Titan International, Inc. TWI: Based-in Quincy, IL, the company is a leading global manufacturer of off-highway wheels, tires, assemblies and undercarriage products. Titan is gaining on strong agricultural fundamentals that will reflect on its top-line results. Higher crop prices, lower inventory levels for new equipment and healthy farm income will aid the company’s performance this year. Titan will also benefit from the implementation of pricing actions to mitigate escalating raw materials, labor and logistics costs."

"gordyguy, did you know that your Dad is not proud of you? be honest man..... you always lie. hope you will change someday."
"With the OEM slowdown, look for TWI to disappoint again. On the call look for the following:No mention of the recycling facility in Canada and how much money has been lost and probably zero oil that can be sold (remember Morry's claim?)Continued downward trend in replacement sales marketEntering europe market with GY again but with US sizes (not Europe sizes) that is now controlled by Trelleborg and Michelin.Russian factory profitability or production of GY tires for EuropeLSW penetration with OEM'sLow usage of Bryon and Freeport facilities and no plans to close oneNo sales of supergiant 57"" and 63"" wheels and tires Just wondering when the analysts calling in will ask tough questions of Reitz - this is a dead stock"
this play is so risky..... shorts playing hard. And Gordys pump and dump tactic wont help this stock.... this will drop and bleed slowly. stay away while you can. cheers.

Interesting move today. Pre-release jitters or a response to steel manufacturer's strong movements?
Gordy is waiting for your money. lol
seems overdone. Bought some under $6.90
Titan is down 7.19% to 7.61
Not to kick em while they're down here but Titan has lost money (negative EPS) for each of the past 8 years. Book value has steadily dropped for $13/share to $2.79/share MRQ. Is there anything in particular that flips that script going forward?
"The new JCB pothole machine is fitted with LSW wheels. Unless I am mistaken, these are TItan wheels. I know that JCB buys tyres from Wheels India, but am unsure whether they include Titan as a supplier. Let's hope the Titan sales force have got their act together and made this sale. The new machine looks like a winner. It will more than likely be bought by most if not all UK local authorities. I will try to find out - unless someone else knows more than me?"
nice....
gordy is back.....
from Ag Equipment Intelligence: more farmers than not (56%) are back to saying they don't plan to buy new equipment in the next year. 14% (still higher than last year's 4%) say they do.It's just a survey so take it with a grain of salt.
