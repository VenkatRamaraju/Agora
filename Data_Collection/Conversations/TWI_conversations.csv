if I were you.....
"With the OEM slowdown, look for TWI to disappoint again. On the call look for the following:No mention of the recycling facility in Canada and how much money has been lost and probably zero oil that can be sold (remember Morry's claim?)Continued downward trend in replacement sales marketEntering europe market with GY again but with US sizes (not Europe sizes) that is now controlled by Trelleborg and Michelin.Russian factory profitability or production of GY tires for EuropeLSW penetration with OEM'sLow usage of Bryon and Freeport facilities and no plans to close oneNo sales of supergiant 57"" and 63"" wheels and tires Just wondering when the analysts calling in will ask tough questions of Reitz - this is a dead stock"
"if you want a good return on your investment. dont follow Gordy. he is manipulator with a lot of aliases. move your money on clean energy. (ev, solar and enegy storages). this is the future. trust me. you will be happy. cheers "
i told you guys... thank me if you sold. we will be back @ 7.30 cheers
The long awaited ag upcycle is here. Buy TWI and the other Titan TITN.
This company needs an activist shareholder to shake em up.
buying twi is....
sold all my position..... glta
"FYI - Relating to the wash sale rules, remember that the loss is incurred on the ""trade date"" if you are selling a long-term position, while the loss is incurred on the ""settlement date"" if you are selling a short-term position."
The chip crisis has dashed the hopes of Titan's customers for a post-pandemic sales recovery. Analysts have now dialed back their forecasts as the semiconductor shortage continues into the second half of 2021. A return to normal supply and demand isn't expected now until the second half of 2022 (which I had openly surmised here previously).
"The new JCB pothole machine is fitted with LSW wheels. Unless I am mistaken, these are TItan wheels. I know that JCB buys tyres from Wheels India, but am unsure whether they include Titan as a supplier. Let's hope the Titan sales force have got their act together and made this sale. The new machine looks like a winner. It will more than likely be bought by most if not all UK local authorities. I will try to find out - unless someone else knows more than me?"
buying this with Gordy is......
"Shortages of components, surging prices of raw materials, transportation backups and pandemic lockdowns are squeezing manufacturers like Titan all around the world, and the bottlenecks keep compounding."
everything.....
buying this now is......
hahahhaha
buying this......
this stock is like Gordyguy's Papa. lol
Titan is down 7.19% to 7.61
"Titan has been trickling down since October 25th. I expect the stock to reach $6.50, and possibly $6.00.......and that's if the logistics issues don't deteriorate further and/or other geopolitical events don't materialize. In the latter event, I expect us back around $4."
"The Deere strike, which began at midnight last night at all 14 US plants, will have a painful effect on Titan if it goes on for an extended period of time."
Take a look at insider buying history. This may be an indication of management sentiment towards price movement. Watch the options carefully. I have owned shares for many years and endored the pain of a mismanaged company.
gordy be like...... lol
buying twi
Not to kick em while they're down here but Titan has lost money (negative EPS) for each of the past 8 years. Book value has steadily dropped for $13/share to $2.79/share MRQ. Is there anything in particular that flips that script going forward?
"sold everything, lastweek...."
John Deere trading at all time high levels due to expectations they are doing well out of the covid issue. The new design for remote monitored tractors seems to be in demand. Titan looks like it could be getting the knock on effect. Just hope they can live up to expectations.
"The thing I find troubling is the fact that Deere who are supposed to be one of Titan's largest customers is booming, they are obviously aligned almost 100% to the agricultural sector. We have CAT seemingly doing well too. How come Titan are hit so badly from this market? seems like they are making excuses to me. The mining sector is doing great guns, I at least make good money trading here, I wonder why Titan doesn't? Thankfully, they are cutting costs, appears like they need to do much more. If ever this much hyped slowdown does appear, then this company could go down the pan."
nice....
"good thing i sold last,week. glta.,cheers.."
"Is TWI one of those stocks that could be moving up due to the Robinhood effect? A lot of newer, younger investors are looking to make a quick buck, and Robinhood is their investment platform of choice. Low priced stocks allow them to purchase more shares, and with limited investing funds, this combination can be a good way to make money. Thoughts?"
"1 hr MACD has rolled over, 2 is flat. I'm looking for 10.25 in a couple of days then I'm back in."
sell it now
its time
best option monday
buying this.....
buy buy buy guys..... give me more money 
"I'm not sure what to expect out of Q4. U.S./Canada ag equipment sales are up 9%+ yoy for the fifth month in a row but I don't know what percentage of TWI sales are from this region. Half of their revenue is from ag equipment so that has to be good, but with steel hitting all time highs, oil rallying, and the cost of sales already 90% of revenue, I'm not sure they can pass that on as well as I'd like.What am I missing here guys?"
