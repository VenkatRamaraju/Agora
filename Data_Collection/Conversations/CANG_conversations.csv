"Trying to learn about this company. Balance sheet says it has 212 mil in cash, 665 mil in Li auto shares, and 392 in receivables. At 153 mil shares outstanding, just the current assets give a per share value of $8.40...this doesn’t even include any earnings the company brings in or will contirnue to bring in... lol"
Can someone explain if the dividend of 1/share will hit our accounts in April?
"CANG down 63% in less than 90 days. Surely, this is a sign of great things to come as Pumpers here seem to indicate ... Not. Something appears very ‘off’ here."
CANG is down -6.79% to 11.26
"Earnings date March 12th, a Friday, should be before opening, daytime in China."
Bought 1000 @10. Good luck to all.
"Marketcap 839M.Cash 249M + Li 914M = 1,163M.So basically you get the profit making and growing company for free!What a joke. :-)"
I think it has corrected enough and could bounce to new highs from here.
once it starts running you can't catch it.
"I'd love to see .06 more and close above the 50 dma. C'mon, algos push us over the hump."
"Nearly at support, $5.40. Good R/R at that level. Earnings is probably next month, as they just reported in March for 4th quarter. If earnings don't surprise negatively, could be headed back towards $8 by EOY."
The chip shortage for the automobile industry is projected to be resolved by the end of the year or at the least by the beginning of 2022. CANG will then be in a great position to benefit and thus CANG stock may beginto appreciate as well.
"oh, forgot to mention....no mention of stock buy-back either. I think they are gonna use that $50M to buy back shares and go private."
"Check out SEEKING ALPHA'S analysis on LI AUTO. Also, it appears that CANG has invested 1 BILLION dollarsin LI AUTO which makes CANG stock greatly undervalued based on revenue projections of both companies.NOTE: CANG paid a special dividend of $1.00 around APRIL/2021."
The big jump today is nothing more than a prominent investment advisory recommendation. Price should settle down through out the rest of the week and maybe even today.
"No brainer to load up here - some day in the near future you will make a profit, just hold onto it. The unknown is how much profit do you make."
what a gift horse! loading up!
Li Auto is doing really nice again! This should impact next earning strongly their balance sheet
"Anyone receive their special dividend today? I checked my account, nothing yet."
I think this is undervalued. They own about 4% of li auto and right now that stake is worth 1.44 billion. CANGs market cap is only 1.2 billion.
the car financing business alone is massive in China. but their car trading and after market businesses are also massive. the have about $800M in cash on the balance sheet. gonna be a huge company in a few years.
Kool! that will buy a brand new car!
"This should be traded at $25+. With this huge cash, the company may give dividends to investors in the future."
Lol what did they ipo at and what are they buying their shares back at
CANG is already up to 24% leading into closing and for tomorrow it's predicted big gains on positive earnings and talks of hitting 20 dollars per share again soo could double asap! Exciting!
"0,14 USD - 0,16 USD profits this year probablyAbout a 40 PE ratio. It is trading quite rich. If I wanted to buy I would want a P/E ratio on this company of 6 to 8. For me it's worth about 1,00 USD."
Resurgence of the variant virus may impact China's economy and perhaps CANG's bottom line.
I shorted the #$%$ out of it & so did everyone else..... ?
Needs a rocket GIF over $11 in AH
Li Auto reports September deliveries increased 102.5% yr/yr!
Mmm you gotta hang in there on this one...still vague to a lot of investors...Amazing revenues...i think it will climb after posting serious rev the next 2Quarters.China car market is going crazy....i got my special cash div in my brokerage account about the 9th......pretty cool!!
CANG reached a new All Time Low at 8.36
"May 31st, D-day imo. CANG reported blow-out 4q earnings and 2020 results and the stock dropped 50% in 3 months. Seems the best outcome is a good ER and the stock stays stagnant under $6. Not sure what would prompt ""da boyz"" to start accumulating."
Seeking Alpha wrote an article over the weekend stating that CANG is significantly undervalued!
Hello $5...i'll start loading up when we hit support
$CANG $YRD $WIMI These companys have some Great potential let’s all spread the word around guy’s and share it to other people and platforms to let them know. This will be at $5.5 or even 6 dollar in no time. Wishing the best for all of us and the company
should trade minimum $20. once people find out what CANG is worth they will bid it up
Big in! really! The price is a joke! My retirement money
"50 dma is $4.46; needs to move impulsively above that to have some momentum...price stuck right below. If it turns down from here, not a good sign at least for the near term."
"@Majestici: Several folks on this board have said that Cango owns approximately 4% of Li Auto's shares and then they multiply the numbers of these shares by Li Auto's ADR (American Depositary Receipts) quoted on NASDAQ to obtain a figure of approximately $1.2 billion as the value of Cango's investment in Li. This is a mistake. Each ADR represents 2 Class A ordinary shares. Cango's shareholding in Li needs to be re-computed into the equivalent number of ADRs for us to multiply by Li's quoted price on NASDAQ. In other words, we need to divide Cango's Class A share holding in Li Auto by a factor of 2 to compute the exact equivalent number of ADRs held by Cango in Li Auto. Net-Net, the value of Cango's share holding in LI is thus halved, or, approximately $0.6 billion (and not $1.2 billion). Specifically, Cango held 39,194,413 Class A ordinary shares of Li Auto (refer Cango's press release on July 31, 2020: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cango-inc-announces-nasdaq-listing-080000830.html) - let's round it to 40 million Class A ordinary shares to make the math easy. These Class A ordinary shares are equivalent to 20 million ADRs of Li Auto. On December 31, 2020, Li Auto closed at about $28.83 per ADR - again, let's round it to $30 per ADR to keep things simple. Net-net, the value of Cango's shareholding in Li Auto is 20 million ADRs * $30 per ADR =$0.6 billion. Still an impressive $0.6 billion, but not quite $1.2 billion."
ruh - roh?! average analyst estimate for 1 year stock price lowered from $10 to $6
"Technically, CANG is coiled for a nice move; bumping up against the 50 dma....7 days up in a row... . MACD, RSI haven't looked this good since Nov. 2020...unless it is being manipulated to stay below the 50 dma, should be a good move near term."
"Been doing stocks for so many years, never seen such insanity. God sake, how people can sell this stock at all? I mean those fundamentals are not from this world, another dimension."
Cango is up 11.29% to 7.79
"Amazing that price for the whole month of September sticks to the 50dma like glue; never seen that before....obvious manipulation; doesn't mean longs won't make money eventually, but only when the PRC commies at Cango allow us to and after they've accumulated enough of their stock at these low prices."
Are people not concerned about delisting in general for chinese ADRs?
"Does anyone know about this company, besides Stansberry research? The stock is so thinly traded. >200k shares traded today with a 26M share float. I didn't think there could be many more sellers left after the Stansberry pump & dump. Fundamentals, balance sheet, earnings, future looks good. 39M shares of LI a blessing and a curse imo. LI down 38% this year."
"Here's the clarification :""The record date is the day by which you must be on the company’s books as a shareholder to receive the declared dividend.Own the stock before the ex-dividend date and you get the dividend; buy it on or after the ex-date, and you don't - the seller of the stock gets it."""
"""net income in the 4th q was US $240M, an increase of 1,234%""somebody just predicted that on the money. he must be an insider or something."
"Well, I'm getting the sinking feeling they may buy back all their stock and take the company private. The $50M that was allocated to buy-back stocks could buy back the float of 22M shares for $2.50. This is not unheard of for Chinese companies listed on American exchanges who feel they are undervalued. Then, they go and list on another exchange like Hong Kong with a new IPO and higher valuation. The article below is informative in this regard. If I don't hear anything on the May 31st call about remedying their non-compliance with HFCA - which would lead to de-listing from American exchanges - I'll assume that's their plan. As it stands right now, there's a 3 year ticking clock towards de-listing for CANG. I even emailed the covering analyst at Goldman Sachs to bring up this issue on the call, but not sure it will do much good. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-u-slisted-chinese-companies-are-squeezing-out-minority-investors-172606715.html"
Cango after they liquidate the trapped American liquidity VIE vehicle.
Who else thinks this is being manipulated?
"Bought 3,600 shares at 11.91Good time to buy the dips"
"Here’s what I infer from their 3rd quarter earnings report, combined with guidance.-Cango Q4 expected revenue = $100M-110M-China auto sales were up 25% in January as the country is further along in the post-Covid recovery.-Company had seen strong double digit sector growth yoy (20-30%)-Estimate Li Auto investment current value is worth ~$450M with the recent pullback assuming they still hold their 20M shares-History off outperforming guidance.-Filed with SEC to buyback up to $50M of their shares.-Cash in hand~ $209M-Market cap as of 3/6 = 1.26billionSummary assessment--It appears they are set for somewhere between $500-800M in revenue in 2021.-Their balance sheet is strong; 209M cash+ 450M in Li Auto stock = $659M.-China auto market is set for double digit growth in 2021.-Based on rapid revenue growth yoy(20-30%) when the car market in China was slumping, They appear to have an incredible runway for 2021 and beyond."
Cango is up 41.18% to 12.00
"Current share of LI auto (4%) is worth 1.27 billion $Cango operations themselves are worth 1 billion $ (that is value BEFORE it became known that Cango had interest in LI, which is about the current price, that is conservative, since the share has been at 11$ before that)Actual current Cango share valuation: 1.12 billion $So adding these two, Cango is worth 2.27 billion intrinsic value. Intrinsic share value is then more than 15$ versus actual share price of 7.50.If you see any stronger undervaluation anywhere, please let me know.The market is acting as if Cango has NO interest in Li auto at all, which is like trading MSTR as if it held no Bitcoin. Makes no sense at all. The fundamentals and technicals are converging.The time to capitalise is now."
technically this is still bullish
"The price to book is way off. What is wrong here, besides low volume?"
"The umptieth time the board is watching the shareholders' (OK, that's their own and ours) backs. Loving it and keeping it. Stellar job. Trust me, they WILL go for a secundary listing sooner than later and that will give us the YI scenario and then some."
I don't like Chinese stocks but this stock is too attractive.
CHINA is now being accused by WASHINGTON of cyber attacks which places a dark cloud over CHINESE stocks in general.
"A down day on 2x normal volume?? Only thing makes sense is those who hoped for an earnings pop are headed for the exits. Picked up more shares, but mind boggling how this stock was $6 1 year ago in the midst of a global shutdown."
Insane revenue growth! Unbelievable! Now is all about expansion and to build solid fundaments for the future. a great company!!
"Will CANG go higher? They are in a niche market.加入微信讨论群：To join the Chinese Investor Group, please add WeChat ID: ChinaInvestorGroup"
Cango is down 9.68% to 8.25
"very important technical area for CANG; about to cross the 50 day MA. It hasn't traded above the 50 day since it peaked above it in March. MACD and RSI are all pointing up, and if price can move impulsively above the 50 day it is a bullish sign for CANG price."
"For any newbies who think they are looking at a good deal on this stock. A prominent stock research firm recommended this stock to their subscribers when it was in the $teens. They quickly issued a sell recommendation as it declined and said they'd re-issue a new buy recommendation at a better level; they have yet to issue that buy recommendation. The ""smart-money"" is not in this stock, aint interested, staying away from it. If you have not yet bought, run away fast, look for a better opportunity. If you are current bag holder, I wish you the best. I've lost enough on this one already."
that will double from one moment to the next
"According to SEEKING ALPHA JUL 24, 2021 ""CANG: A Massively Undervalued Chinese Fintech Play.""""A quick look at Cango's income statement gives the following first impression: growth at an unpredictablespeed, declining margins, and consistent profitability."""
"CANG, LI, XPEV, NIO are all at their Oct/Nov 2020 price levels. There is no demand for CANG stock, ie; options not allowed so no attempts to cover positions. Low short interest, so no shorts buying to cover positions. No stock buy-back by the company itself. No recommendations to speak of, other than Dr. S. from Stansberry who essentially pumped and dumped the stock in Jan/Feb. Every time there is a rise in the stock ""trapped buyers"" unload their shares sending the stock down. The company has a fundamentally strong balance sheet, but imo be prepared to buy and hold for the long term, until the stock is accumulated by the company itself and institutions."
Check out $W I M I as well. Highly undervalued Hologram Tech company
"Man I shorted this down just to $8 , I skipped that huge dividend & made $100,000... but I could have kept shorting it down & made another $250,000 ..... "
New Low already today. Going to 11.
"Looking again at its twin share Yi, then Cango will rise over the next two days all the way to 14,5 to take a break at 12. The pattern holds true over the last two years."
what time is earnings?
Stansberry recommended today to increase the stop loss to 50% from the high instead Of 35% . So the new floor trigger level is +/- 9.80 for their followers.
"Cango Inc. to Report First Quarter 2021 Financial Results on May 31, 2021 Eastern TimeI guess they are unaware it's Memorial Day and market is closed???"
"My best guess is that someone has broken the news to one or the other YouTuber (I've done my best to spread the news) and he is now loading up the boat. Everything is cheap under 20 USD, so just just get them while you can....Another possibility that I wouldn't discount is insider buying since there is no public information and the investor conferences are behind us."
Any idea why the huge jump in PM today?
Amazing Results. Congrats Cango
"Hoping this company is not a ""China Hustle"" a la Luckin Coffee"
Yahoo Finace pute the target estimate for this stock at a 110.00 a share. How did they come up with that figure?
going downhill
I'm thinking the forward P/E based off operating income is about 8. Do we know what the quarterly growth of the car sales revenue was
Jumping back in @ $5
down so much on this stock but holding strong
"Profits moving in right direction, they own 39Million shares of Li Auto, lots of great work done in Q2, can see these guys flying on results this week, $12 plus incoming! DYOR!"
"Very difficult to place a valuation on a small Chinese company because there is skepticism about the veracity of the accounting. Now that day/swing traders have swarmed all over the stock, we will probably continue to see a lot of volatility. Happy New Year!"
sooo undervalued
Yes... Once an Avalanche Gains momentum...run fast or get buried!
China is world’s largest auto market.Cango is well positioned. Buy and hold.
"So I read an article about a month old that claimed CANG had a P/E ratio of 4.48. If you look at it today, I see a higher P/E ratio. I am just dabbling with a few hundred bucks trying to learn what I can. That said, if you care to teach me something, what are the mechanics behind why a company's Price to Earnings ratio would jump up like this. ?Noobie"
"I've expected to down further to the 20MA where I can buy double, but the stock is performing well today despite overall down of the market. I do not know which Chinese EV company will succeed, but for any cases, Cango will profit. I will keep holding as my average is around here, and I will see something exciting will happen."
"Cango's ER: *The Year-on-Year comparisons increases are meaningless as China was shut down 1st qtr 2020.*Top line revenue only increased by 2% from 4th quarter 2020*2nd quarter revenue is projected to DECREASE by 20% from RMB1,123.8 million to RMB 900 million*Chip shortage expected to have material impact for the rest of 2021*Vague mention of ""changing regulatory environment"". The fact is CANG is in non-compliance with HFCA and will be delisted by 2024 if they do not remedy and allow U.S. audits by PCAOB of their balance sheet.% * 1.3% margin on car trading transactions needs to improve*Management is very explicit that they will do what's best to grow the value of their company; not return value to shareholders. Buying all outstanding shares, delisting from U.S., and a new IPO in Hong Kong would probably be most advantageous. This stock is stagnant and dead in the water for 2021, at best. Just look at the sell-off after earnings to know what the market thinks of CANG. Hopefully 2022 will be better for them, and CANG shareholders, if they are still listed in the U.S."
CANG stock showing weakness lately especially today! Lots of concerns overhanging the market IMO for the rest of the summer.
"Unfortunately, some investors got caught in a ""Pump and Dump"" scheme. An Investment advisory service puts out a ""Buy"" recommendation on a little known stock such as CANGO that trades with low average volume. Buyers rush in and the volume goes up to over three million when the average volume is around 200,00. The Pump lasts one or two days, and then the Dump starts."
"The inability of the price to come down despite the strong overbought indicators speaks volumes. It is holding up amazingly well. There is no doubt in my mind that we will blow past 19 in a month or to. Don't forget to buy back and take a look at what's happening over at Yi, which Cango always outperformed."
Cash on balance sheet $650M. Market cap $830M. It's a cash cow.
"Li + 10%, Cango follows later with results 2020!"
"SEEKING ALPHA POST JULY 24, 2021""Despite risks/concerns outlined above, I believe that Cango is massively undervalued at its current price: it has a profitable core business, is expanding to provide more value to its business partners"""
superior earnings growth will not go unnoticed for long. Another one coming up in a couple of months.
unfortunately China is the young American in terms of economics. lots of young fast growing companies will be coming of there. and tons of money will be made by Americans too without lifting a finger as long as the two governments get along. they have massive population. hopefully they will straighten out their accounting eventually.
CANG was trading low $6s in June 2020 in the midst of a pandemic and uncertain future of the auto industry in China. How in the world is this now back to low $6s trading less than 2x earnings? Anyone have any ideas?? The chip shortage?
"MACD on the 15 minute chart showing positive divergence and heading in the right direction. Hopeful multi-day slide ended yesterday.I was a little suspicious of the recent price action being manipulated; large volume sells spiking the price down every few days, then the announced buy-back of shares today....i dunno, don't care at this point if it turns upward."
Waiting for $1 dividend.
"Why you stressing yourself? This is an insane company, superb fundamentals, anywhere u can worry but this one, u just buy and relax. it is an amazing stock and for sure is a around 18 the right price."
"CANG earnings out and look awesome. Revenues up 357%, grew cash, sold off some LI Auto but still have plenty of shares, projecting 900-950RMB revenues this quarter. Chip shortage is a risk but they sell/finance plenty of used cars too! LI Auto mark to market caused small loss otherwise would have been a profit. LI Auto is much higher than at end of last quarter so just a paper loss. CC @ 9pm ET tonight."
"It looks like all of these ADR's are looking for another listing on one of the Chinese markets, that would be rocket fuel..."
Is the price down a dollar because we will see $1/ share distributed to our brokerage account on April 8?
"Great stock, too bad no options available. Don't have 100K laying around to make big profits."
"Someone noticed that Li was up 4% and Cango (owns 4% of Li Auto, i.e. equal to roughly 1.2 billion USD in cash, while Cango itself is well worth another billion USD), was down 7%, and that this did not make sense and had to be arbitraged out, and 1 minute after I noticed, it actually happened, expect more arbitration of this kind, hence more sales volume."
One Word........ Up
UPST is in the same business like CANG...but in the US. It almost doubled today for earning a mere $1M in q4 or 7cent per share.and it's valued more than $8B.it's clear Chinese companies dont get respect and are way undervalued compared to their US counterparts.
"SHANGHAI, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (""Cango"" or the ""Company""), a leading automotive transaction service platform in China, today announced that its board of directors has authorized a new share repurchase program (the ""New Share Repurchase Program"") under which the Company may repurchase up to US$50 million worth of its outstanding (i) American depositary shares (""ADSs""), each representing two Class A ordinary shares, and/or (ii) Class A ordinary shares over the next 12 months starting from August 26, 2021."
Why is CANGO so comfortable having what is essentially the equivalent of their market cap in shares of LI Auto? Cant they realize the enormous risk this entails?
how net income increased from 58M in 2019 to 516M in 2020?
A 3 month 66% decline; are the sellers exhausted yet? I'd like to see CANG start deploying some of the $50M they earmarked for stock buy-backs and some other institutional buying would be good too.
"Check out $CANG who posted incredible results, will also fly today! DYOR!"
cang is ready to run! first stop $20
I need more clarity around Net Income from operations. In the earnings release it says Net Income excluding Li Auto increased 72% but then it goes on to say Net Income was $260 million but the change in value of li was $269 million...I'm assuming there is a typo somewhere
"This is for sure for retirement. It a unique gem, P/E 1, just out of this world. I bought all dips and now in with 48000usd."
"HOLD HERE $2 plus next week! ALSO $CANG posting earnings after close, they own 39M shares in LI AUTO and their Q3 results look to be very strong!"
"I'm not sure if you guys know but the numbers displayed here on the financials are in Renminbi. Not sure why Yahoo doesn't do the conversion. The position in cash is around $218 million. Besides that, the company sure is growing steady and strong."
This company is just being discovered. The market will take care of that though.And they do pay an annual dividend. I believe it’s 3%.
"Still holding, not sold any CANGO. If you didn't sell at 19, why would you now?"
The company cash flow is immense and can absorb a lot. It should be very bullish today!!!
CANG owns almost 40M LI class A shares...
Headed back towards 10/share
13G filed. CEO is buying.
Awesome ness... skipped out on the DIVIDEND & still grabbed over (100%) profits without dealing with DIVIDEND Taxation!
"This is an article on CANG from Seeking Alpha May 17th. I also wrote a question to the author and he responded. Bottom line, there's alot to like about CANG as a business, but alot of risk associated with the stock because of the Chinese ownership structure, not allowed to be part of an index in the U.S. , and possible delisting. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4429278-cango-rapidly-growing-under-radar-saas-auto-tech-stock-triple-digit-return-potential"
Patience. Start averaging down when you see a 7 in front.
Cang reminds me of Game Stop. It might pop up to over $100. Chinese investors are like gamblers.
"Question to author of Seeking Alpha article:""My main concern is with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCA) which was passed in December 2020, but which the SEC just implemented in March. I think you alluded to it in your article. Cango must allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to audit their reported financial results. The PCAOB keeps a list of foreign companies who have not complied, and they have 3 years to comply or be delisted. Cango is on the list. Their complicated ownership structure probably prevents Cango from complying due to the possibility of having an audit take a detour in other directions and into other parties which may not desire a U.S. audit. What are your thoughts on this as a headwind to accumulation and the stock price rising in the future? To your point, if the stock is not accumulated by index fund investors or institutions, there's limited demand for the stock and the price will stay stagnant. Or, do you think in spite of the risks mentioned above investors could begin to take notice?""ANSWER:""HFCA is a definitely a risk here and there's no easy way to know where this development will land in the long run. With a very reasonable valuation and a strong growth outlook, I'm willing to give CANG a year or two and see if the investment thesis plays out. However, I could also see where the HFCA risk could turn away potential investors. I'll be running this race with CANG, but certainly won't have all my eggs in this basket."""
ZACKS came out with a STRONG SELL for CANG at this point in time! CHINAS stock market looks weak as well!
Q4 report should also be spectacular!cang is still undervalued given the growth potential.
How much is the divy this time ?I read $1.00 for ADR's and 50 cents for the stock.Can someone please clarify.

great article on Seeking Alpha today about CANG
"Earnings report after close from $CANG who own 39million shares in Li Auto which values them at $9.50 by itself, expecting good results taking the numbers to $12 plus! DYOR!"
"05:03 PM EST, 03/11/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Cango (CANG) reported after markets closed on Thursday Q4 adjusted earnings of 10.53 yuan ($1.61) per American depositary share, up from $0.76 yuan per ADS in the prior-year period.The Chinese automotive transaction service platform also reported revenue for the December quarter of $1.09 billion yuan ($168.2 million), up from $438.5 million yuan a year earlier.Cango said it anticipates Q1 revenue in the range of 1 billion yuan to 1.05 billion yuan. That compares with 246 million yuan reported in the prior-year period.The company's American depositary receipts advanced nearly 5% in after-hours trade.Price: 10.62, Change: -0.23, Percent Change: -2.12"
"Just moving up and up, day after day. I'm loving this Cango action"
"SEEKING ALPHA SEP 3 2021""The country's(CHINA)auto market is reviving and is set to be in a growth trajectory for quite some time."""
"I have 3500 shares, want to sell covered calls to have extra income but this stock has no option trading"
"Yi is up 30% today, over the past year they have generally moved in tandem, with Cango actually outperforming as it is turning a profit and Yi is an eternal loss maker in the medical services space where profits tend to be frowned upon. Cango will follow on the road to 19 very soon."
"Investors are concerned regarding the surge of the DELTA VARIANT virus spreading throughout CHINA with increasing gas prices impacting the economy as well, etc, etc."
"When I look at the company income statement, it states that there was a fair value change of equity investment of 228,008,773 dollars for the 4th quarter of 2020. Does anyone know what this means?"
is really a joke that this stock is at this value! it should be 20at least.
Today may very well be the day we hit $5.00!
"The emergence of new outbreaks threatens the country's economic recovery, which continues to slow. The effects of heavy flooding in central China and rising commodity prices are also weighing on the country. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing index fell to 50.3 in July from 51.3 points in June. Above 50 indicates an expansion of the economy, but data released today signaled a significant slowdown."
Good day so far
you are getting this fantastic business for free! because their 39m shares in LI auto is worth more than $1B
CANG reached a new All Time Low at 10.38
CANG is a high growth company. it's a cash cow. they buy back shares and pay you dividends. be patient and accumulate.
"YI made the big jump today with +38% (doubling in a few months). This gives a lot of hope for CANG, I've always considered YI the little sister of CANGO, both are portals, one in the medical and one in the automotive space. I expect a similar jump for this one. Yi has actually always lagges CANG but has now caught up for the first time really, so time for our jump back ahead."
looks like a genuine move to first stop to $20 has started on it's way to $60+
"Net loss , -41,800,961$ USDThis brought the third quarter net income to $0Today's share price is expected to start at -20%, 4.75$"
Cango is up 7.02% to 3.66
"Nice move, the share buyback program is not very large, but well-timed and the main point for me is that they care about the share price. What would really move the price is another listing in Hong Kong, but the value proposition is already great as it is, just keep up management performance, which so far has been just great."
"Pardon me, but as much as the revenue increasing, prospect looking good, can anyone explain to me why is their assets decreasing and their liabilities increasing?"
Have to wait out till things around China quiet down and if the company keeps getting good results this cant stay down forever
So undervalued... PE ratio of 1. Cango is a GEM. Insane upside. IMO 10x in under 5 years
PE Ratio is 1.96....this is crazy undervalued...Maybe manipulation because company wants to buyback stocks for 50 million ....
they have more cash on other places
CANG reached a new All Time Low at 11.68
Chinese company?? No thanks.. enough said.. hehe THE MAX
Well we still have no upward movement. Market up big $CANG maybe up a little to down a little. Market down big $CANG down big. Looks like we will be holding for years.
"We all know that it will happen, but soon stocks will be purchased back. So when this happens be on the boat"
Nissan news good ... CANG only went down 7% instead of 10% today. Things are looking up!
"quadruple witching day, among the bloodbath market, this is outperforming. very interesting, I feel institutional buying, 50MA become a strong support line. Let's see what's going to happen."
Buy CANG MONDAY... Then You Don't Get The DIVIDEND... but CANG.... WILL ONLY BE $7/BUCKS
"@Jeff you are so active on this board trying to scare everyone, but not working Shortie, sorry for your losses, the longer you hold your short position the more you will drown"
Is the reduced price due to short selling?
"Dear Commies at Cango: We know you are manipulating the stock price to stay glued to the 50dma, because if it goes above that, with the MACD signaling bullish, the algos will kick in and start buying your shares that you want to buy on the cheap. So, let us know when you're done buying your shares and manipulating the price to keep it cheap for yourselves. Thanks.P.S. Dr. S. over at S.R. got kicked in the nuts pretty hard after he pumped the stock price, so message has been received. Over and out - shareholder"
they blew it! this is a $60 stock minimum!rare find...growing super fast and paying cash out to shareholders.how many companies you know who do that
$8 / a quick $100k / smart advanced 
"These numbers are insane, Q4 forecast:For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company expects total revenues to be between RMB700 million and RMB750 million. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.The Company's investment in Li Auto and the change in fair value of investment due to the price volatility of the stock may have a significant impact on the Company's fourth quarter financial results.$12 plus incoming! DYOR!"
"UPDATE>""BEIJING — (AP) — China suspended flights and trains, canceled professional basketball league games and announced mass coronavirus testing in Wuhan, as widening outbreaks of the delta variant reached the city where the disease was first detected in late 2019."""
"The issue with $CANG is that there is very little knowledge or interest about the company. Both retail and large investors are oblivious to it, which makes me very hopeful about the future. China sentiment is weighing heavy on these type of stocks, but I'll keep accumulating and lowering my averages until it pops. Which it will in due time."
Some power is holding the price back. No way this should stays under $5 this long.
"100 mio not 50mio buy back! insane, that this not flies higher"
Strange price action for month of September; look at 3 month chart. Share price sticking to the 50 day moving average like glue. Almost like it's being manipulated....strange.
"Be aware of general risk of de-listing for many Chinese companies who do not comply with U.S. SEC audit standards - Sarbanes-oxley PCAOB auditing. The ""Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" signed into law December 2020. CANG is on the PCAOB list of companies who do not comply, as is BABA, ATHM and many others. This is putting downward pressure on all China company listings.https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/global-equity/chinese-tech-stocks-plunge-on-tighter-access-to-u-s-markets-15648295"
Stock has potential to avg at $15 with buy back and more positive earnings end of may
nothing wrong with the company.its just caught up with the tech selloff.
"The volume action on this stock is suspicious. Ridiculously light volume and as soon as price ticks up a few cents this morning, 10:25 suddenly 11k shares are traded in one minute and price sinks. The ""China Hustle"" seems in full swing. Just beware to anyone entering new money; this may be going to $5 or lower before a reversal. I am long 2100 shares at $8.83 btw."
"CANG, Dr. Sjuggerude of Stanberry Research stock pick of the year fumbles at the 20-yard line."
"cang probably has more than $15/shr on the balance sheet. litte to no debt. they are in the car and insurance finance business, plus some side businesses they're starting. each business they are in is huge and growing very fast in China."
The Dividend is Payable April 8; for shareholders of record March 22; THE ex-div DATE IS March 19... THIS FRIDAY..... YOU MUST OWN CANG THIS FRIDAY.... TO GET PAID APRIL 8TH
"And today, we have a network of nearly 50,000 registered dealers nationwide, making Cango a leading technology-based automotive transaction services platform in China.Building on this solid foundation, we are actively expanding the upstream and downstream of industry value chain, extending our reach to the car trading transactions and aftermarket services facilitation segment, pressing to forward toward the goal of better serving customers and the auto industry as a whole."
That what happen when their no volume a stock. Long 500 shares at 8.35$
"84k share volume on the day at 1:45?? Well, hopefully that means all the sellers are gone. Bought 500 more shares today."
"Auto sales in China surged in March for their 12th consecutive month of gains, as the world's biggest car market leads the sector's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.Sales reached 2.53 million vehicles in March, up 74.9% year-on-year, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, increased 239% in March to 226,000 units.NEV makers, such as homegrown Nio Inc and Xpeng Inc , as well as foreign groups, such as Tesla Inc, are expanding manufacturing capacity in China as it promotes greener vehicles to cut air pollution.Another Chinese auto industry body, China Passenger Car Association, said on Friday Tesla sold 35,478 China-made cars in March. Chen Shihua, a senior executive at CAAM, said the industry body expects the chip supply shortage to have bigger negative impact on China's auto production in the second quarter than in the first."
Mark my words: expected quarterly EPS should be within +1200-1400% and quarterly revenue based on my investigation should have increased at least by +35% (max 45%). So sunshine day it is for us soon!!!
"I put huge amounts into this, the company is doing more than well! The P/E is insane!"
"made in puke land, is still true in 2021!"
Low volume today and no news. Buy more while it's on sale!
Nice move up on heavy volume leading into the ER on 5/31. Should be more of the same tomorrow and Friday
someone had asked about P/E for the company. I'd look at Income from operations for the quarter of $30mill (especially since they move the li investment from long term to short term investment). if you annualize the $30mill I see $120mill pretax income for 150 mill shares (EPS from core operations is $0.80). if someone wants to do the tax adjustment to see what we would actually get I'd be interested in what you come up with
32:26% shares held by institutions 32:26% of floating shares held byInstitutions what does that indicate.
IMO (In My Opinion)we have seen the bottom for both CANG and LI. Both stocks are significantly higher today!
"one questions: if u buy this stocks via germany stockmarket (tradegate), will u get the dividend?"
What in the world is the going on. Now trading less than 3x revenue? Makes no sense at all
Where are the Dividends?
it should blast past $20 soon or latest by earning date in late march. they gonna crush it too.
Special dividend just posted in my account! ADR fee charge too :(
"CANG will be up to $10 very soon, now is a great time to load up"
"Technically pointing to 16, that's the target price, 30% up from here in the not too distant future. Fundamentally all is just going fantastically well, expect a complete blow out report. Wall Street will catch on at some point. Meanwhile the LI interest is much more properly covered after yesterdays jump, complete coverage also coincides with the 16 price point. So, coming for sure."
Cango showing some price strength recently with good volume. GLTA!
"Well, how did this happen?"
"CANG has invested 1 Billion Dollars in LI AUTO which reported it's earnings today!""The main takeaway is that LI continues to emerge from TSLA's shadow in China and that its future looks bright as it looks to expand capacity and launch new models in the years to come."""
Chinese Feb. auto sales said to be up 300% yoy!
it will see $40 before it sees $10
"If you don't want to read the whole report: Profit for Q4 was about 1.60 $/share (rounded down for metrics like diluted, undiluted, non-GAAP...)Profit for the year was 3.45 $/share (also rounded)If you extrapolate Q4 to the whole year, that is 6.4 $/share in the covid year, so actually not including growth!Yes, that is United States dollars, so #$%$ is the price 9.82 $/share?And they have grand expansion plans for the crazy Chinese EV car growth market.And, oh, yes, before I forget, there is now a 10%+ dividend yield for 2021."
Cango is up 22.30% to 9.98
share buyback. nice.
"Hoping this move up is not a head-fake. We haven't seen a 4%+ move up in CANG since March 26th. 4 hour MACD, RSI, ACC/Dist indicators all pointing up."
"December 30, 2020. HUGE volume today and yesterday with HUGE volatility. Over ten yesterday, back down to seven today. What does it all mean?? Sorry. I have no idea."
What happened today? any clue?. Sold half my shares. 120% return. not bad at all.
"Furthermore, CANG stock is up .29 Cents in after hours trading!"
ATHM is also from China somewhat in similar business. it used to be small but a few years ago but grow fast. now it's a $13B company and the stock is in triple digits.
Bought more shares today averaged down. Will add more if it hit $5. Just need some patience.
Buying 100 more around $4.75
"""SHANGHAI, Aug. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) (""Cango"" or the ""Company""), a leading automotive transaction service platform in China, today announced that it plans to release its second quarter 2021 financial results after the market closes on Thursday, August 19, 2021. The earnings release will be available on the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.cangoonline.com/."""
Cango is up 11.11% to 8.20
"Wow...i'm impressed with how low CANG can go; I think it's going to go private, but didn't think we'd see this level. So, the company can now buy back the entire float of 22 million shares with the $50M they allocated for stock buy-back. Ah, gotta love Chinese companies doing the ""China Hustle""."
MarketBeat has an intelligent writeup/presentation of CANG history/background which might of interest to investors looking for undervalued stocks.
"One of the anonymobozo cellar dwellars on this board said: 'Wow, trading volume goes 10X overnight on some obscure Chinese company .. accompanied by 42 % 1-day gain in pps .. with -0- change in company fundamentals noted. Hmmmm ... gotta make you wonder.'You wouldn't call an American company with 2 billion USD in sales and hundreds of millions in profits an 'obscure American company', so the implication of this mindset is pretty obvious... We don't need to wonder about that, we all just know. And I'm not Chinese. You just have to be really dumb to not realize that we are lucky that a Chinese company actually chose to make this investment opportunity available on the American market instead of the Chinese market. The Chinese are swimming in money, but there are other factors that you will never understand. So, yes, just keep wondering with your small mind, the answers are very far away and you wouldn't recognize them if they were dangled right in front of you.So the fundamentals are just fine, and they will be shown to have improved over the last quarter with the next results report and to be getting even much better going forward with a stellar management performance."
Averaged down. Stansberry does have a whole bunch of very smart people doing their due diligence. I am not worried at all about this position.
Might be worth 12 a share.
"With so many negatives associated with CANG stock it is difficult to continue holding onto CANG stock.The negatives are that the CHINESE government is being accused of hacking MICROSOFT, the DELTA VIRUS, INFLATION, THE PRICE OF GASOLINE PER GALLON AND LASTLY THE POSSIBILITY OF CANG GOING PRIVATE AND/OR THE POSSIBILITY BEING DELISTED."
The uncertainty of how the virus variant will impact the economies worldwide and put pressure on stocks in general especially in China!
"Finally closed above the 50dma for the first time since March. MACD signal line about to go positive for first time since March. All systems look good for a nice run....only thing is it would be good to see some heavy volume. 8 straight days green, can't complain."
smart move. company buy back.
Looks like margin liquidation. Buy buy buy
Why this one has such a low volume? It looks like a good company.
"Stagnant even with $1 dividend going EX-D tomorrow! That is a whopping 10% for latest qtr, annualized that is 40%, unheard off. Profitable and growing, so why low interest? Thoughts?"
I’ll keep an eye on it
"Why you should buy this stock long-term.Cango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaders in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run.Overall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not bet on the entire industry..."
"Pre market is flying, nearly $13, $15-20 happening today!!! DYOR!!"
CANG reached an all time low at $7.66
No worries here strong long term set and forget
cang is more like futu than gme or amc...booming business and tons of cash. futu went from 10 to 120 in a year.
Cang net cash is twice as much as its cap!
Does anyone know how many LI Auto shares Cango owns? 10 mil ADS sharesThis is out of their 6K from June.The Company’s investment in Li Auto and the change in fair value of investment due to the price volatility of the stock may have a significant impact on the Company’s second quarter of 2021 financial results.
"For months, it was just money lying around, public information just waiting for people to act on. By the way, this management team is so great. Making connections, tying in and getting tied in and involved is their superforce. They just have all the best players lined up for their platform and their EV future looks even better."
"https://www.hotcars.com/decade-long-chip-shortage-could-impact-chinas-auto-industry/China's auto industry was recovering nicely, but not yet back to 2019 highs; 2021 was to be the year to exceed where the industry left off in 2019. This is concerning; need some good news on this front, in my opinion, and China auto stocks will soar."
"Stansberry Research just sent notification to sell CANG, so this will tank today as subscribers unload shares, just as it jumped when Stansberry recommended. I'll hold until this selling pressure abates and hopefully shave a few points of my losses on this #$%$"
Seems Li Auto is improving significantly which was the main reason for net loss last quarter. So I assume we will have some good days ahead
will rocket back up to $20 once earnings are released in a couple of weeks.
$1/share dividend is pretty hefty. thanks CANG.
"I can kind of understand why CANG and LI don't move together.There is no guarantee that CANG will hold on to its stake, we know nothing about the conditions or deals related to the holding. They might as well sell it at any moment for what they may consider a 'better' opportunity, or they may offer LI more financing and get an even higher stake.That is to say: it is LI that interests you, just buy LI. This kind of 'surrogate' holding is often attractive for investments that are NOT available (see, the emerging Bitcoin shares), but not the case here.So I was and am holding CANG on its own merits, as a great play on the higher end of the burgeoning China car market, EV's and all. They have a finger in so many things, including maintenance, financing, insurance, user data... Great overall. I reckon CANGO itself is easily worth 1 billion, that is just twice sales, cheap valuation for a high growth share...But adding the 4% of LI, now worth 1.4 billion, it should be worth 2.4 billion or double the current price, just right there."
The chart looks beautiful...
is it too late to get dividend
"4 hour MACD, RSI, candle pattern looks ready for lift off. Hopefully gain some momentum when it crosses the 50 day MA to propel a strong move. Let's go CANG, time to rise and shine."
"Ronr, honestly, who cares what you say? u short, we all know. at least don’t put non-sense here"
"December 10, 2020. Big increase in daily volume over the past two weeks. Cango is on the radar of traders so expect more volatility. Hopefully there will be more Institutional investors picking up shares of Cango."
"Cango Inc. (NYSE: CANG) is a leading automotive transaction service platform in China connecting dealers, financial institutions, car buyers, and other industry participants. Founded in 2010 by a group of pioneers in CANG""By utilizing its competitive advantages in technology, data insights, and cloud-based infrastructure, Cango is able to connect its platform participants while bringing them a premium user experience. Cango's platform model puts it in a unique position to add value for its platform participants and business partners as the automotive and mobility markets in China continue to grow and evolve."""
"Another down day on low volume. Not enough buyers. CANG needs to jump in with the $50million they allocated for stock buy-back to make this jump. I would even love to see more short interest as shorts forced to cover would at least generate some positive volume/price action. Short interest is ridiculously low, but it did rise this week. Anyone on this board involved with WSB?? Can you give CANG a lift? LOL."
They Announced a $1/dollar special Dividend.... THAT KINDA.... SAYS IT ALL.... YOU ANONYMOUS LOZER!
