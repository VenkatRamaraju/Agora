"I've expected to down further to the 20MA where I can buy double, but the stock is performing well today despite overall down of the market. I do not know which Chinese EV company will succeed, but for any cases, Cango will profit. I will keep holding as my average is around here, and I will see something exciting will happen."
The chip shortage for the automobile industry is projected to be resolved by the end of the year or at the least by the beginning of 2022. CANG will then be in a great position to benefit and thus CANG stock may beginto appreciate as well.
"Today on the net!""The shortage of semiconductors, which had impacted 92% of companies Morgan Stanley surveyed, has delayed production on everything from new cars to computers to a host of other consumer electronics which require the tiny chips to operate."""
Today may very well be the day we hit $5.00!
"SEEKING ALPHA POST JULY 24, 2021""Despite risks/concerns outlined above, I believe that Cango is massively undervalued at its current price: it has a profitable core business, is expanding to provide more value to its business partners"""
"quadruple witching day, among the bloodbath market, this is outperforming. very interesting, I feel institutional buying, 50MA become a strong support line. Let's see what's going to happen."
Cango showing some price strength recently with good volume. GLTA!
"very important technical area for CANG; about to cross the 50 day MA. It hasn't traded above the 50 day since it peaked above it in March. MACD and RSI are all pointing up, and if price can move impulsively above the 50 day it is a bullish sign for CANG price."
"Why you should buy this stock long-term.Cango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaders in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run.Overall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not bet on the entire industry..."
IMO (In My Opinion)we have seen the bottom for both CANG and LI. Both stocks are significantly higher today!
Does anyone know how many LI Auto shares Cango owns? 10 mil ADS sharesThis is out of their 6K from June.The Company’s investment in Li Auto and the change in fair value of investment due to the price volatility of the stock may have a significant impact on the Company’s second quarter of 2021 financial results.
"Finally closed above the 50dma for the first time since March. MACD signal line about to go positive for first time since March. All systems look good for a nice run....only thing is it would be good to see some heavy volume. 8 straight days green, can't complain."
"Technically, CANG is coiled for a nice move; bumping up against the 50 dma....7 days up in a row... . MACD, RSI haven't looked this good since Nov. 2020...unless it is being manipulated to stay below the 50 dma, should be a good move near term."
"Amazing that price for the whole month of September sticks to the 50dma like glue; never seen that before....obvious manipulation; doesn't mean longs won't make money eventually, but only when the PRC commies at Cango allow us to and after they've accumulated enough of their stock at these low prices."
"50 dma is $4.46; needs to move impulsively above that to have some momentum...price stuck right below. If it turns down from here, not a good sign at least for the near term."
"100 mio not 50mio buy back! insane, that this not flies higher"
Li Auto reports September deliveries increased 102.5% yr/yr!
Some power is holding the price back. No way this should stays under $5 this long.
Have to wait out till things around China quiet down and if the company keeps getting good results this cant stay down forever
"Here’s what I infer from their 3rd quarter earnings report, combined with guidance.-Cango Q4 expected revenue = $100M-110M-China auto sales were up 25% in January as the country is further along in the post-Covid recovery.-Company had seen strong double digit sector growth yoy (20-30%)-Estimate Li Auto investment current value is worth ~$450M with the recent pullback assuming they still hold their 20M shares-History off outperforming guidance.-Filed with SEC to buyback up to $50M of their shares.-Cash in hand~ $209M-Market cap as of 3/6 = 1.26billionSummary assessment--It appears they are set for somewhere between $500-800M in revenue in 2021.-Their balance sheet is strong; 209M cash+ 450M in Li Auto stock = $659M.-China auto market is set for double digit growth in 2021.-Based on rapid revenue growth yoy(20-30%) when the car market in China was slumping, They appear to have an incredible runway for 2021 and beyond."
So undervalued... PE ratio of 1. Cango is a GEM. Insane upside. IMO 10x in under 5 years
"The issue with $CANG is that there is very little knowledge or interest about the company. Both retail and large investors are oblivious to it, which makes me very hopeful about the future. China sentiment is weighing heavy on these type of stocks, but I'll keep accumulating and lowering my averages until it pops. Which it will in due time."
"CANG earnings out and look awesome. Revenues up 357%, grew cash, sold off some LI Auto but still have plenty of shares, projecting 900-950RMB revenues this quarter. Chip shortage is a risk but they sell/finance plenty of used cars too! LI Auto mark to market caused small loss otherwise would have been a profit. LI Auto is much higher than at end of last quarter so just a paper loss. CC @ 9pm ET tonight."
"According to SEEKING ALPHA JUL 24, 2021 ""CANG: A Massively Undervalued Chinese Fintech Play.""""A quick look at Cango's income statement gives the following first impression: growth at an unpredictablespeed, declining margins, and consistent profitability."""
"CANG has invested 1 Billion Dollars in LI AUTO which reported it's earnings today!""The main takeaway is that LI continues to emerge from TSLA's shadow in China and that its future looks bright as it looks to expand capacity and launch new models in the years to come."""
"Dear Commies at Cango: We know you are manipulating the stock price to stay glued to the 50dma, because if it goes above that, with the MACD signaling bullish, the algos will kick in and start buying your shares that you want to buy on the cheap. So, let us know when you're done buying your shares and manipulating the price to keep it cheap for yourselves. Thanks.P.S. Dr. S. over at S.R. got kicked in the nuts pretty hard after he pumped the stock price, so message has been received. Over and out - shareholder"
CANG’S billion dollar investment in LI may prove profitable as a direct result of the recent buy recommendation of LI stock.

Strange price action for month of September; look at 3 month chart. Share price sticking to the 50 day moving average like glue. Almost like it's being manipulated....strange.

Be patient. My average is around 50 dma and i will accumulate more if it gets there. They also pay special annual div so it is good for long term investment
"A down day on 2x normal volume?? Only thing makes sense is those who hoped for an earnings pop are headed for the exits. Picked up more shares, but mind boggling how this stock was $6 1 year ago in the midst of a global shutdown."
Dont understand why this isnt a $25 stock?
