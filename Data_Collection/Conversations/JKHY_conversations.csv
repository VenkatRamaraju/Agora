WoW! I'm very surprised. Have to add more here. I guess I'll buy it all the way down to $100/share.
This much decline does not match earnings. One of the screwiest stocks
Jack Henry & Associates is down 4.90% to 165.52
What are deconversion fees? That seems to be holding revenues back. Is it a new type of item the last year or so?
BUYING nio is the right thing to do. Read the charts and news on NIO
Jack Henry & Associates reached an all time high at 176.68
I will be going all in if JKHY drops 20% from 150

Does anyone know if the company is working any crypto solutions for banks?
"I wonder if this significant price drop will sustain throughout the day tomorrow, considering that the earnings came out after hours today. A lot of people haven't and won't have the chance to sell, if they plan to, before it drops more."
Why is JKHY declining (172 USD -13%) after reporting GAAP EPS of $0.80 (slightly better than expected)?
Decline due to big drop in earnings for next year???I see all the forecasts for earnings are way down now. That is why the big drop in stock price. Must be dilution from their new proposed acquisition. Hope that works out.

"Jack Henry is one of the finest ""fintech"" companies in the country."
"All in as of today. They will have so much business coming in they won’t know what to do with it. 7,000 banks, and growing! With the New SBA stimulus packages coming thru their bank clients alone, $250 by May baby! LONG and STRONG!"
Director Thomas Wimsett bought $1.39M of JKHY today:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/779152/000077915220000123/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml
I missed the conference call. What did they say to impact stock price today?
Great company. a ton of regional banks use these guys. Keep buying on the dip because it'll end up hitting $200 by the end of the year.
