"IAC is difficult to value because they are essentially a venture capitalist specializing in the media space. They acquire businesses, nurture them, and spin them off - with remarkable success. It is their focus on media that makes them unique, and valuable. This type of focus is not available in many of the SPACs being launched."
How much Vimeo shares do you get by owning shares in IAC after it spins off?
"Monthly metrics out. ANGI slight deceleration frpm a nice August, but still good (revs up 18%, marketplace 21%, Amgi Services, part of marketplace revs, up 149%). Last couple of months much better than earlier this year.I added some ANGI yesterday and bought some IAC today (10/12/21)."
"I look for the next IAC catalyst to be a Turo IPO, or Turo getting acquired. With the chip shortage leading to a decline in new car production and an increase in used/new car prices, this should be a great year for Turo. It is the absolute perfect time to take the company public at a nice valuation."
why is this up 10 percent after hours?
A few more days like yesterday would be better.

"May I ask a not very impressive question. I have held IAC since the Ask Jeeves acquisition days, and I just cannot recall why I/we did not receive ANGI shares when when Angi and Homeadvisor combined and were spun off. I am getting old.... but very much looking forward being a Vimeo shareholder! Thank you."
This was definitely a good buy for me at 110.
Blame it on the Nasdaq. Nice and green. What rebound???
ANGI monthly growth has reaccelerated. Up 21% in August 2021. DotDash also did well. Good for IAC.
"New bench marks issued and the stock responds by falling from $153… yep, on the way up via the rope ladder."
"How low today, $125?"
At least being up $10 is a lot better way to get to $180 or $200 than losing for several days in a row. Rather be leaving the $125 range for now.
Have they announced when the Vimeo spin off will happen?
"What nice gain from yesterday??? Did not last long enough to buy a cup of coffee with it. A near $180 target price?? Right, in one’s dreams."
"Hahaha. Gotcha. Up $15 in after hours yesterday. No news, and today up $0.02 at 9:00 pre-market. Nice."
