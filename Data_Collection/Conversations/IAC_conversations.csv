"Monthly metrics out. ANGI slight deceleration frpm a nice August, but still good (revs up 18%, marketplace 21%, Amgi Services, part of marketplace revs, up 149%). Last couple of months much better than earlier this year.I added some ANGI yesterday and bought some IAC today (10/12/21)."

"I look for the next IAC catalyst to be a Turo IPO, or Turo getting acquired. With the chip shortage leading to a decline in new car production and an increase in used/new car prices, this should be a great year for Turo. It is the absolute perfect time to take the company public at a nice valuation."
this is not going as well as I hoped or expected.
"IAC is difficult to value because they are essentially a venture capitalist specializing in the media space. They acquire businesses, nurture them, and spin them off - with remarkable success. It is their focus on media that makes them unique, and valuable. This type of focus is not available in many of the SPACs being launched."

ANGI monthly growth has reaccelerated. Up 21% in August 2021. DotDash also did well. Good for IAC.
This stock is weird. Up and down with no news.
Nice day going.
A few more days like yesterday would be better.
"Something interesting for you guysPAYO, PSFE, FINV, GGPI, STAF and MVST and NIO and ASTRCheck and you decide!! "
Ridiculously under-valued after the spinoff. Residual company is priced at 2.5x sales and growing at 25%.
iax up + 20% today?
"What nice gain from yesterday??? Did not last long enough to buy a cup of coffee with it. A near $180 target price?? Right, in one’s dreams."

Stoked about the Vimeo spin-off. Not currently an IAC shareholder — any guess on the share price when the bell rings?
This is like sitting in your easy chair with slit wrists snd watching the blood slowly drip out.

1.6 Shares of Vimeo for each IAC share￼
"For everyone asking about Vimeo, go read some filling for christ sake"
At least being up $10 is a lot better way to get to $180 or $200 than losing for several days in a row. Rather be leaving the $125 range for now.

They had some interesting insights about IAC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
IAC/InterActiveCorp is down 5.32% to 243.14
Encouraging to be at the low for the last 6 months. Keep thinking it will turn and move to that $230 target. Those guys must get paid to hype.

"May I ask a not very impressive question. I have held IAC since the Ask Jeeves acquisition days, and I just cannot recall why I/we did not receive ANGI shares when when Angi and Homeadvisor combined and were spun off. I am getting old.... but very much looking forward being a Vimeo shareholder! Thank you."
This is a great company
Hell yea
Slow and easy.
Have they announced when the Vimeo spin off will happen?

Uhg.. Attorneys they're claiming AIC stock damage when they're tanking the stock with their press release. The irony.

"Has IAC been hacked? I haven't been able to access my match.com account for six days now. Whenever I request a password re-set, they say they've sent an email to my account but I receive nothing. Not in my in-box, not in my Trash, not in my SPAM folder. I have done this multiple times over the last 6 days and have yet to receive ANYTHING from the company. Radio silence. Come on you incompetent f*cks, figure out how to do your frickin' jobs and service your paying customers."
"WDLF,A very inexpensive social media company just the type of acquisition that Barry Diller could do wonders with. Check out their profile on yahoo finance and I am sure you will agree with me"
IAC/InterActiveCorp is up 6.59% to 171.64
Next big move is for Diller to announce what company he plans to acquire for the $3bn in cash IAC is holding. Then a Turo or DotDash spinoff

"IAC (Nasdaq: IAC) will attend the Goldman Sachs 25th Annual Communacopia Conference at the Conrad New York Hotel in New York on Thursday, September 22, 2016. Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin will present at 12:25 PM ET ET. Options Traders are pricing in a 5.7% move by 10/21. found the data here https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/IAC/OptionChain"
At Angi current market cap the evaluation of Angie Home advisor is around $5.5 billions. The market cap of IAC is $8.5 billions. Either IAC is way undervalued or angi is way overvalued.
Nice after-hours pricing. Always something. Hard to imagine how those analists come up with their lofty target prices. I guess they get paid more the higher the target.
why is this up 10 percent after hours?
I could see this company being mysoginistic led by Mr Diller...can see that easily....something doesnt smell right in fact it stinks so they will settle soon.....
I saw a company in the marketplace space with 65 marketplace and adding 235 more. Localzz Network
Will likely get an update on August sales numbers from IAC by mid-September. Prior to the last quarter release IAC gave an update on June sales on July 15. In keeping with new policy of not giving guidance but monthly sales updates.

The results of IAC's/Vimeo spin off are obviously terrible and anyone in it is suffering big time today...I wasnt around for the Match spin off so dont know what happened but this ine is leaving me a couple thousand down today versus yesterday
