"IRM management has guided for Adjusted EBITDA margins to expand substantially in 2019. If they manage to achieve their target, IRM will be more profitable than they have at any time in their publicly traded history."
"Yesterday's dip was a great buying opportunity, and even today we are still under-valued but that is fine, at least we made a respectable move following the strong earnings report!"
Now this is interesting! IRM has executed a sale/leaseback on some of their properties to the tune of $358M. Brad Thomas been talking about this for a while - I believe even mentioning it to their CEO. Looks like his message got through.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201203005227/en/Iron-Mountain-Announces-Industrial-Sale-Leaseback-Transaction-with-Blackstone-Real-Estate-Income-Trust/
"According to my calendar, IRM shares go ex-dividend next Friday (6/12). It also occurs to me that if an investor is short shares on that day, the investor is charged with the dividend, so it behooves those in such circumstances to do whatever is necessary to avoid this situation since the dividend for this particular firm is rather high. JMHO."

"Thank your Mr. Market, just added to my IRM position under $26. Christmas came early this year! LOL!"
"When shorting stock, persons who are negative about the future potential of companies need to be willing to ""throw in the towel"" at some point, or risk losing enormous amounts of money. In theory, short sellers risk the potential of losing an INFINITE amount of money, since theoretically a companies stock can rise an infinite amount. Not likely or really even possible, share prices can rise an exorbinant amount from time to time. Whoever has zero risk aversion is looking at potentially losing equal to or greater than 3X the amount they received when they sold the shares. This is EXTREMELY risky when a stock is breaking out, as other shorts are covering which drives up the price, and in this stock there is a lot of institutional accumulation taking place, which also drives up the pps in a healthy and long term manner. Additionally, they must pay the dividend that comes due each quarter. This stock is undervalued by most metrics and is gaining visibility based on rising prices on above average volume. Sensible people would cut their losses and would have covered short positions here weeks ago.Fodder for thought, whoever has not yet covered their short positions."
IRM has got to be one of the most beautifully balanced COVID >> post-COVID companies in the world. Increasing business in digital storage and cloud PLUS renewed income in the legacy storage and shredding businesses as companies go back to the office in 2021.So impressive a turn and track-record.
"They keep on growing, little by little with guaranteed income deals. Impressive!"
 Suk it Rex...you're overvalued. You must be under pressure with your low internal cash flow and no growth 
"I see some people are irratated by the price going lower but if you are long and look at their 5 year chart they have been in a yoyo narrow range for the last 5 years. Be patient, relax amd ride out the lows and collect the great dividend. Remember that you only lose when you sell so if you are in this stock for a short term gain this is not a stock for you. I believe this stock will break their narrow price range but not sure when and will hold and collect their great dividemd which has worked out great for me. I take advantahe of tje low dips to add shares. Just my opinion. Long term holder!"
Several insiders just bought shares after the German data center announcement. To me thats a bullish signal.
"Results look great, other than withdrawing guidance. Who wouldn't do that? Kept dividend as well. FFO looks good as well."
"Can someone explain, in plain English, how can irm have a divy payout greater than 100% and continue. I am a divy player and have a long term investment in the Mountain. Thanks"
"Analyst on CNBC halftime report just recommended IRM -- said she spoke with management yesterday and they are ""rock solid"""
"This is more great news from IRM.....IRM is expanding its data center footprint in London with the announcement of a new 27-megawatt built. In addition, the company recently added 4 megawatts of new capacity at its LON-1 data center, bringing the total power capacity at the facility to 9.1 megawatts.Iron Mountain’s second facility in London, LON-2, is located in the Slough Trading Estate. The three-story facility will offer new colocation opportunities, carrier-neutral connectivity options and easy access to preeminent global peering exchanges, global networks and cloud on-ramps.Additionally, the expansion at LON-1 will facilitate the company to provide a variety of on-site network services like rich connectivity options and dark fiber accessibility to hundreds of networks, clouds and service providers."
Great stock for assured dividend cash flow!!
"The key for IRM will be to successfully grow their data center part of the business. If they can do that, they should do extremely well in the years to come. Long term hold for me, I've been in since $30 and love to see temporary dips to add to my position."
"The significant racial and social injustices we’ve witnessed around the world over the past year have reaffirmed and accelerated our commitment to foster meaningful change,"" said William L. Meaney, President and Chief Executive Officer, Iron Mountain. ""We’re excited to welcome Charlene to our global Iron Mountain leadership team. With her extensive background in leading, developing, and implementing impactful diversity strategies, she is the perfect fit"
Wasn't IRM supposed to go ex-dividend today?
 Debt -to- Equity ratio is an incredibly high 7.7 times
Nice day today when you consider it was IRM's Ex-Dividend day. IRM gained about 80% back from the dividend reduced opening share price (which is almost 62 cents).
"Today's weak performance is likely due to the smear article by Zachs this morning. Earnings and FFO tomorrow morning are likely to be much stronger than they indicate, and we'll be off to a strong start once released in the morning. IRM is trading at a significant discount today and it's a great day to average down at this $26 dollar range. Tomorrow the intrinsic value will be realized when they release the quarterly financials and shorts will be covering."
"Just curious for those that DRIP. I bought this at $25.75 for the 9+% dividend yield. I’m in early retirement so I need the cash flow with potential for capital appreciation as the cloud centers grow stock price. For DRIPs, why do you not take dividend here and invest in growth stock if don’t need cash now? I’m am only curious not accusing anyone of anything."
"Long time shareholder here. I think IRM will continue to climb. Between April and May, 2.7 mil short shares bought to cover there position. There are still 35m shares short or about 17 percent of the float. I think there will be alot more covering and we will be in the 60s or 70s, or even higher before we level out."
Good buy at these prices Earning were good and dividend is safe
wonderful 7.33 % divvy. doubled my shares today. eps and revs up next year
"The fourth-quarter common stock cash dividend of 61.85 cents per share will be paid out on Jan 6, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15, 2020."
"""Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:IRM), the storage and information management services company, today announced that, further to the press release dated February 24, 2021, it has closed on the agreement to form a joint venture with Web Werks, one of India’s top colocation data center providers. Iron Mountain expects to invest $150 million over the next two years and anticipates being the majority investor in the venture after the investment period."" God I live this company! The most reliable in my portfolio."
"I think we might see some short pressure building against IRM. This due to perceived over evaluation right now.The Data Center segment of the business is still rather small. Even though this segment grew it's revenue by over 15% last quarter, it's still only about 7% of all revenue.The short speculator is banking that the Records Management segment (which is the biggest revenue-generating product at 61% of Q2 '21 revenue) will have a steep decline in the near future. I think it will a very gradual process and be generally offset by IRM's other segments.I'm still very Long here. Yes, we may see a drop at some point (with IRM or in the whole market), but there are too many positives to ignore with IRM.I'm not expecting any Dividend increases in the near future. The numbers show the dividend is safe, but IRM will want it continue to build it's other segments first (so they will need the cash). Once those other segments contribute more to the total revenue, then IRM can up the dividend."
As of mid October- >36 million shares short- resulted in greater than 16 short ratio- this thing can continue higher for awhile!
"Whenever I read reviews of IRM by some financial analyst, inevitably there is some reference to its declining paper storage business, because “the world is going paperless.” This myth persists although Iron Mountain receives 20,000 boxes of paper documents a day.I’m now 66 years old and I’ve been hearing this myth of the paperless office since I was a young buck installing IBM terminals all over the aerospace company I worked for 30 odd years ago. In the late 1980s most departments I supported switched from IBM mainframe to Local Area Networks with PCs or UNIX workstations.Every group had their own printer or two and we wore them out with all the paper that was printed through them. Entire forests of trees rolled through our laser printers. We heard tales of going paperless, but I never saw it. Never even saw paper consumption slow down. I remember a manager salivating over the new color printers “that were so reasonably priced.” He had to have one.The thing is… whenever someone creates an important document – a document important enough to have people put their signature on it, you want it in paper. And you want to keep it in a safe place. That is the business IRM is in. Storing the important documents, not any old document a company cranks out. I think there are a lot of business writers and analysts evaluating IRM and qualifying its future earnings thinking that a company’s important legal documents, or tax documents, or engineering documents, or even the company founder’s documents are going to be digitized out to cyber space along with everything else in their paperless world. I doubt it. For the important stuff people still want paper."
What effect does the vacant office have on IRM short term? Long term?
Cup and handle completion- watch for a break past 47 - if that happens - 52 is the next target.
"The market rewards growth and this has a lot of growth. At some point the data center business will be worth a lot more than the legacy business. I haven’t done that analysis, but that day could be here or very close."
she may hit fifty...
Must have shot up from shorts that were getting hit on gamestop being forced to close other positions. I didnt sell. This is still a long term play.
"Why the massive short positions? Yahoo Finance shows: Short % of Float (Oct 30, 2020) 24.26%. Can someone give an intelligent, brief ""bear"" argument? I don't care about the stock price appreciating, just considering a long position for the nice dividend yield in my retirement years."
"The shorts are going to have to pay me a dividend in March, then again Jun, then Sep ..... That’s going to get old at some point. Read the Moody’s report. The company’s exposure in faster growing int’l markets and continued transition the fast growing data centers gives them warm fuzzes—given the steady cash flow. 5% rate on debt is nice. Smart leverage is accelerating rev growth."
70% of revenue comes from a dying paper storage business 
will be back to 30 ish by year end. 25% stock appreciation is a no brainer. dividend is a plus
"I bought IRM for $32 end of April, I expected to be up to $36 already.. Such a good company with all 500 S&P companies as clients.. I guess I will just keep collecting 7.5% divs for a while as they are very safe for the foreseeable future. it sure beats 2.5% treasury"
Iron Mountain Q3 FFO of $0.61 beats by $0.06. Revenue of $1.04B (-1.9% Y/Y) beats by $47.92M. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $370.0M vs. a consensus of $352.2M.Woo-Hoo! Great job Iron Mountain.
Welcome me to the family .......jk. Appears cash flow is covering dividend. Hopefully remains that way until Project Summit is complete.
"Novice, I am a semi novice in that I know where I stand in all this. Stocks go up or down before earnings. Traders are betting what the report will show. if there is a loss. but the loss is less than expected the stock will go up. if there is a gain. but less than expected. the stock will go down. And guidance plays into it. Texas Instruments to the upset at CNBC fumbled its guidance and the stock got hit. In my opinion you can buy a good stock on a dip and it will recoup. Yesterday the stock took a hit and I grabbed more if the stock hit 42.85 and 42.95. It closed up."
"Coming back to this BofA analysis, IRM's EBITDA margin is 30-34%. So even if recycled paper has 90% contribution margin, at less than 5% revenue you're only looking at 100-200bps decrease in EBITDA margin if recycled paper prices continue to decline. I just don't see how that could possibly justify the $25/share price target."
"For some unknown reason we've lost around $4 during the month of September after a relatively flat trading pattern for quite some time. With the generous dividend, this is great place to park cash yielded from other trades. No reason for the $4 decline in value in less than 4 weeks. Good time to buy cheap shares with an even higher yield."
I just added shares because I believe it will go back up eventually to its past $34 dollar range.. Long term holder.
IRM is significantly under valued. 30% revenue is from the data center.
As I’ve stated before- stocks that break 10 year highs typically move much higher. Love this company.
smaller and weaker competitors folding operations - IRM poised to gain even more marketshare - and profits!
"A little squeeze on the sack is all it takes. Shorties need to cover their margin calls, and the dividend payment needs to be made in several weeks, an additional 2% added to their losses."
Can anyone please provide insight on recent proxy item proposing the “issuance of an additional 8 million shares “of stock? It’s not clear to me if the intention is to issue additional stock or if the intention is to use shares that are already issued and designate them to their stock compensation plan. It makes a big difference in terms of dilution. Although the item is listed on the proxy for shareholder vote I could not locate more detailed info on this item anywhere else in IRM materials.
Beware- Diminishing Returns
Interest payments well covered by AFFO!
Overvalued 
 According to analysts' consensus price target of $33.00
"Came across this earlier today: ""The London Internet Exchange and Iron Mountain Data Centers, a division of $IRM announced that LINX NoVA will be installing a switch into the VA-1 Iron Mountain Data Center facility in Northern Virginia, making the facility a full LINX interconnection location."""
"I used to work there - the management and vision was amazing and prepared for downturns proactively. Don't know about the current structure, but I believe in IRM business model, ethics and future. My analysis is that small agile competitors do not have the reserves to withstand adversity - and IRM will absorb the business they leave in their wake. And the dividend is outstanding."
"Agreed that IRM is a long term investment and the dividend makes up for down and sideways share price. With the upcoming digital storage this should move the company into the digital age, (long overdue). Why not buy a cloud storage company that has the technology already in place?"
"Going add shares before it goes. back to the mid 30s, which I strongly believe it will. the"
Why is IRM down today?Is it because 10 yr yield hit 1.6%?
Sold 8k shares in ‘97 and have regretted it ever since....been rebuilding a position in the last 6 months
Iron Mountain is a good stock I'm buying it 24
 Iron Mountain has a PEG Ratio of 4.43. PEG Ratios above 1 indicate company is OVERVALUED 
"Novice, you can buy this on margin and the dividends earn more than the interest. But hold it. Also. when a stock goes ex dividend the value of the shares drop by the amount of the dividend. I bet here they recover. Hopefully by the end of that day."
"Seems like a rotation to quality and yield would have driven irm up, but instead it went down like a high flying tech stock. Go figure... Absolutely makes no sense."
GOOD REPORT!https://investors.ironmountain.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Iron-Mountain-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx
Eventually will hit 50 and beyond! Solid dividend. Great company.
"Shorts not giving up, still 35M shares sold short as of May 14th. IRM was at $41 around that time."
Anyone worried about the 2.3% drop today?
"IRM has completed or will soon complete 450 MW of data center leasing capability. This is in addition to the hugely profitable old storage business that is funding the new data centers. If priced relative to the market of data centers, the data center portion is worth $5b alone, valuing the old line business at only $8b. By EBITDA/debt evaluation, conservative market cap for IRM should be around $20b or around $60/share. At some point when data center grows out to 600 mw, this may have to be spun out if market still doesn't price it appropriately.To put it in perspective:IRM 450 MW, $13b market cap, 5.6% dividend, 11.5b debt, 1.4b ebidtaEquinix, 1350 MW, a $68B market cap, 1.55% dividend, 14.6B debt, $2.6b ebidta.

"I have been long with this stock for a long time, never have sold a share, love the dividend, how can you be short this stock? I would be worried about having to pay the dividend!"
Another huge upswing for IRM today. After months of hibernation...
"Jenny said 12 PE, 8.75% yield, and low to no impact to businesses they serve makes IRM a great buy. Price at time of her buy recommendation was $28.15. Buy IRM."
If IRM is held in an IRA are dividends taxable?I can find good if when reported in K1 but no good info for 1099.Thanks
"Realistically 43-46 makes sense based on current prospects/numbers. Anything higher than that is a bit much unless the company is up to something we, the people, know nothing about. I am amazed at the disinformation posts on this forum acting like paper documents can legally, ever be made obsolete. Hopefully 45 by mid-summer. Best of look longs!"
Time for a dividend increase?
This is a great buy and hold long term stock! I have owned it for over 5 year's and reinvest the distribution's and very happy with the profits so far. I don't Intend to sell anytime soon.
Nope
The Mountain is rocking the house!!
We cut paper. We built data centers. Our stock keeps going up. Out dividend is huge. Any questions?
This ais a great stock that is for some off the investor's radar. Really good dividend and sood growth. I bought around 6 months ago and doing dividend reinvestment for the long term. I will continue to add on price dips.
"Ok guys, for those who are fed up with lack up upward move - be aware that IRM is not a growth beast like Apple or Tesla. IRM is a consistent revenue maker with good potential but high debt and risks. Hence the massive divided to keep investors interested. The long-term trajectory is upward, if you look at the historical chart, but in stock investing there are no guarantees. If you look for quick gains, look elsewhere. If you enjoy the dividend of 8%, stay long but keep in mind, a dividend cut could result in major sell off. I'm long, but cautious. definitely wouldn't make this my largest position.good luck!"
"How can anyone be selling this stock when it is going ex-dividend his Friday, June 12,2020.What are investors thinking? Do they need a wake-up call?"
Interest payments are not well covered by earnings
Ironman is a good flick. Congrats!

IRM rocks. I have been a large shareholder for 5 years with many buys after I learned about the company from my employer who used there services. Have not sold one share. What a great investment .. love the dividend.
"I'll acquire more at this price, 7% is too big of drop. Indicates oversold. The company may have missed slightly, but revenues are SOLID and it is a well managed company in a good sector."
the management team here is fantastic!! Once COVID is gone this stock will be $65 a share easy. Management had been proactive in refreshing the business model and taking advantage of core strengths. They are proactive and smart. Great job management of Iron Mountain. I'm long on this stock!!
Nice to see IRM to stay in green today when most REIT's finished down due the rising interest rates.
Value Line has a very good report on IRM and raised their estimate for the 4th qtr. They also have a much higher estimate of next years earnings. Their 3 to 5 year target is 40 to 60. They estimate that IRM will raise the dividend about 3% per year. If they are close to being right the shorts will be annihilated!
Took position today after watching for a while. Do you guys have any thoughts on their budding digital division? they seem to be the repository of data for google's AI and ML tools. Is it possible that this turns them into somewhat of a growth stock as well? Thoughts?
Report looks good
Down 10% in last month…smart money exiting quickly 
57% per year return works for me
I still have some IRM on margin. I get 5.5% dividend. I pay 3.6% for margin debt. I have a core position.

"A diversified tenant base also helps the company enjoy a steady revenue stream.Moreover, strength in its core storage and record management businesses acts as a tailwind. Iron Mountain has a steady stream of recurring revenues from the business, deriving the majority of its revenues from fixed periodic storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. Higher volume in faster-growing markets and efficient revenue-management efforts resulted in robust organic growth for its storage rental revenues.Iron Mountain has ample financial flexibility to meet its near-term debt obligations and other capital commitments, while pursuing growth opportunities. Specifically, it had total liquidity of $2.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2021, including cash and cash equivalents of $315.9 million."
"Bought in in mid September for approx. 29 and in mid November for approx. 26 bucks. Living in Frankfurt/Germany. Have a look at IRMs page ""Frankfurt Data Center"". Here in Frankfurt the ""who is who"" is located EQIX, DLR... DE-CIX reached 9,1 Tbps in March 20. Safe and stable energy supply. The Frankfurt Data-Center is fully leased to an American Fortune-100 company. Do you know what I mean..... Think it's a great company with a great dividend yield for the long run. Sry if my American English isn't that perfect...."
"That juicy dividend! And this is a global industry leader that is properly transitioning to electronic data storage. I'm buying if it goes lower, I will sell and take gains when it hits 30-35. In between I'll get paid the dividend Rinse and Repeat. But I do see long term upside with interest rates at 0 for the next 2 years. Have to park your money somewhere or lose to inflation."

"Storage and information management services company Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM) has announced the acquisition of a data center in Frankfurt from Calcium DC Pte. Ltd. The company has acquired the data center for #$%$76 million. The deal is expected to close within the next 90 days, subject to customary closing conditions.The data center has 2.6 megawatts of leased capacity and 8 megawatts of capacity available for retail colocation customers. With strong network connectivity and a capacity to add edge computing in the future, this acquisition marks the second data center of Iron Mountain in Frankfurt ? a 27 megawatts pre-leased facility is already in its portfolio.The company?s focus on Frankfurt can be attributed to the fact that the city is a strong global data center market due to its standing as one of Europe?s major commercial and financial hubs."
"Solid company during tumultous market conditions. That bid dividend keeps the company relatively stable when others are correcting hard. Most important, it is a reliable dividend even though it is high."
Down 6% in 5 days. Did we reach a bottom or will it fall further?
How IRM classified as a REIT ? I’m fairly new to investing and doing some DD on IRM. Antone ?
"Solid company, solid dividend. Expect solid share price appreciation in the coming 6 - 18 months. On sale now. Buy now."

Any thoughts on where this will be in say 6 months to a year? I have been adding to this most of the past year and love the company and div.
"I like what they did with the CEO's stock options. He can't exercise until 2024 and has until 2031 to expire.So his options are dependent on the stock price, not like a lot of companies where they just give away the stock. I think an independent chairperson of the board is good. If they want the big money make them earn it.Options 228K.Exercisable in 2024.Expire 2031.You can go to B&G food web site investor relations and get the full document."
"IRM is like a metaphorical caterpillar[ changing into a butterfly. Most still believe it is a company that stores old paper data, and it does, but its entire future is invested in changing into a cloud and data center company. The beauty is the old paper storage business is a cash cow to wean the butterfly. Management is totally invested in this transition."
"Great earnings report and data behind it. dont buy this stick for price appreciation but for the big dividend. up and down stick pre and post dividend. I'm long for the huge dividend, growing electronic data storage segment, stable physical storage segment and effective, creative, efficient management team."
Another nice dividend received today (my current yield is just a little over 8%)...plus there is a nice unrealized gain sitting there in case I need to cash out for any reason (which I'm not planning on doing anytime soon).Good Luck to All IRM Investors.
"Gotta love these market closes where IRM closes into strength, and volume day after day. The company is strong and has been undervalued, now they are getting some publicity and the stock is showing continued accumulation taking place. Time to release the gonads of the shorts so they can cover and cut their losses before we break through 30."
I have held this company for many years ... they were the storage company for my Employer. Solid Investment with a killer dividend to boot.
"IRM will ebb and flow with the rest of the market and get smacked around because of fears about its dividend being cut or stopped. But my thinking is that with all of the volumes of paperwork and information coming out of the government's efforts to boost the economy, IRM will pick up a lot of this business. Think about all the bank documents (loans, modifications, etc), unemployment files and data, information about restructured companies, etc. They need to house this stuff somewhere. I liken IRM to Self Storage warehouses. They get busy when our lives get upended (divorce, lost jobs, lost house, death, people moving around)."

Historically there has been a dividend increase every year since 2010. We are overdue for an increase.Maybe in 2022?
They are constantly looking for opportunities to expand their business which is one of the main reasons I am bullish and a long term investor
"IRM shares dropped about 5% the last two weeks of September. It looks like a few of the short Investors took advantage of the lower share price to get out. Here are the numbers for late September.Shares Short on September 30, 2021 was 28.94MThe previous weeks were:29.29M (Sept 15)27.74M (Aug 31)28.27M (Aug 13)28.79M (July 30)28.59M (July 15)30.28M (June 30)34.57M (June 15)33.38M (May 30)35.06M (May 15)36.38M (April 30)37.72M (April 15)Short % of Shares on September 30, 2021 was 10.00%The previous weeks were:10.12% (Sept 15)9.58% (Aug 31)9.77% (Aug 13)9.95% (July 30)9.90% (July 15)10.49% (June 30)11.97% (June 15)11.56% (May 30)12.14% (May 15)12.60% (April 30)13.06% (April 15)In early October, IRM shares continued to slide further (about another 5%). We've had a great rebound the last few days, so it will be interesting to see the next Short numbers in a couple of weeks.Good Luck to all IRM Investors."
"the rest of the market going through correction, but IRM is still rock solid! "
I hope the Shorts covered yesterday....Because I believe it's going to cost them a lot more going forward. The Shorts also can't be looking forward to covering the dividend next week. Good luck to all IRM Investors
"Recently, Iron Mountain signed a 10-year 2.4-megawatt lease with a Fortune 100 tech customer at its WPA-1 facility in Pennsylvania. Through the first seven months of 2021, the company has leased 19 megawatts of capacity at its global data-center portfolio."
Deadline for EX div date is closing in for a great dividend payout.
bought a starter position of 300 shares today at 23.40 .....hope my research pays off.....
"What is the story with IRM paying investors a dividend that exceeds its income? This is a good question. The answer is they predict that dividends after 3 years are expected to be thoroughly covered by earnings (316.5x coverage). I know... It sounds scary to me too. However, Iron Mountain's earnings growth has exceeded the US REITs industry average in the past year (103.7% vs 16%). Iron Mountain's share price is below the future cash flow value, and at a moderate discount (> 20%). So, what will IRM management do in the meantime until the gap is filled? I don't know what approach they have in mind. In October of 2014 they did a stock split of 1000 to 1082. Maybe something like that is the solution. I don't know. Bill Meany, the CEO, seems to be a very sharp guy.There is an old Wall Street adage that goes like this: ""Always bet on the jockey, not the horse."" Bill Meany is the man who got IRM converted into a REIT by taking on the IRS and convincing them that his company qualified for REIT tax status. It took him almost 4 years to pull it off.I work in Information Technology for a well-known finance company. My company's technology is constantly being improved, and I have a good idea of where that junction between technology and finance is heading. I think Bill Meany has it right. In all my years, I've never seen a computer network get smaller. The size of the equipment may become more compact and the bandwidth of the fiber may become more efficient, but computer networks always get bigger.So, I believe that Bill Meany's investments in data centers are the way to go. There are a lot of up-front costs, and there is a lot of the ""If you build it they will come,"" blind faith involved, but in my experience if you build a large state-of-the-art data center, they WILL come.China has a population that is nearly 4 time that of the United States. Except for the latest disagreements, China's business growth has taken their economy from the primitive days of when Nixon went to China, to today, where China has the second largest economy in the world. I don't see that trajectory changing.With all that business growth and all those people, China's data center needs will become astounding. IRM may never get the opportunity to build data centers inside of China itself, but any country near China will find a willing market for anything they can sell or trade with China. Like Canada and Mexico's advantages at being so close to the United States, proximity of being close to China will have advantages, too.Building data centers in Singapore, Thailand, and any other country that is a near-by trading partner to China seems like the closest thing to a sure bet in the business world that exists. Yes, IRM is way in debt because of these investments, but I feel that in the longer run (three years) IRM will be the REIT that's in a class by itself."
"I sold this last year in mid-20's while thinking it was a good company, but tired of no stock movement. They are a good company and I was wrong to sell. Congrats to the longs!"
Barry A. Hytinen talking about opportunities at the conference today. This generally gets some buyers. It appears that a fund is closing out positions or reducing shares which is driving the stock lower. This should be good for other investors to get in at a good price for the long term. Good luck to all. I bought some more yesterday!
"Dividend is safe! $0.6185 on the way. “On November 4, 2020, Iron Mountain's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6185 per share for the fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter 2020 dividend is payable on January 6, 2021, for shareholders of record on December 15, 2020.”"
Bought 500 shares yesterday and will be happy if IRM stays above $21 and doesn't make a new low. Looking forward to report of financial results for the quarter.
"I have thought that when this is over $50 and the yield drops below 5%, that it could trade as a growth stock. That could mean a much higher stock price. Longer time investors (dividend investor) still get the same dividend. That would be a very good scenario for some."
stagnant dividend growth
"Anyone know where I can get some mouth watering dividends and some thick and juicy cloud exposure for my fat portfolio.? What, what! Iron Mountain you say. Well that might be the smartest thing I’ve ever heard. Cheers to you my friend and may your stock charts remain firm and always pointing up."
"Honestly, I never thought this stock would get over $32. And I was happy with that as long as they paid the quarterly dividend. Now im ecstatic."
"I don’t think there is enough volume to indicate significant short covering. There is probably some, but most of the increase is the market liking the direction IRM is moving."
"Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the storage and information management services company, today announced that it has signed a six megawatt data center pre-lease with a U.S.based Fortune 100 customer in Phoenix, Arizona, at its new AZP-2 data center."
"They missed one quarter which was the last. Way oversold. They will recover just look at the revenue increases each year plus they have a fix loan agree,ent at 4.8%."
Happy with ER. Plenty of FFO to cover dividend and some growth opportunity in future. Slow and steady wins the race. I’ll gladly bank dividends and sleep well. I bet we will see some appreciation once froth settles as other high dividend payers discussed dividend cuts recently. Dividend seekers will be rebalancing and looking our way. Go look at LUMN. Panic over there yesterday after conference call.
Debt pressures mounting for IRM putting maximum stress on dividend
"QTS buyout gives great appraisal for IRM business:As I posted previously,last available stats:QTS, 320 MW, $4.4b, 3.2% dividend, 1.9b debt, $248m ebitdaIRM 450 MW, $13b market cap, 5.6% dividend, 11.5b debt, 1.4b ebidta, 1.6b ebitda guidance for 2021Now, buyout of QTS for $6.7b plus assumption of debts, implies that IRM digital business worth about $9b plus assumption of ~3b debts, leaving $4b market cap to cover an old-line business generating ~1.1b ebitda at $8.5b debt. I mean that is hugely undervalued. I am surprised this hasn't been bought out by Berkshire, BAM, or some other large group @$65 and taken private."
"Thank you  Rex  for again being IRM's good luck charm!You're like Batman (always there when needed).Posting your old classic quotes is like a huge ""Buy IRM"" spotlight in the sky.Keep up the good work there buddy"
Storing boxes IRM was/is the 800 lb gorilla…..playing in the cloud is where the big boys reside. Is there ample room? Sitting on a crapload of stock and love the quarterly dividend. Wish I could see the future…
"Good earnings report, then down grade, then total market slump brings a good safe dividend close to Eght percent. Good long term buy and hold."

"IRM is one of my cornerstones in my retirement income. I love this stock and don’t mind it bouncing around. If young, buy and keep investing you will be very happy in 30 years!"
is this a short squeeze? several divi companies I own are all up double digits today. BGS is up 20%
Does anyone else think Zacks Research Group is going to be wrong on IRM earnings tomorrow?
"That was an ugly day. Many of my REIT stocks were down some, but not like IRM. I didn't see any news on IRM that would have caused such a drop."
3/27/18 247WallstreetIron Mountain Inc. (NYSE: IRM) was started as Buy and assigned a $41 price target (versus a $31.27 close) at Goldman Sachs.
IRM is squeezing some shorts today...for some reason short sellers have had about a 20% float for a long time. I don't think everyone in the market understands IRM major shift to data centers.
"I can afford to wait. The market is discombobulated. That’s unfortunate, but it won’t last long. Maybe the large funds will avoid shorting and focus on solid companies with good dividends."
"I have been long this stock for over a year and the company continues to deliver solid results. Given the short interest, this stock could really rally and fly. Hopefully the Robinhood traders will pick up on this one and buy it!"
"IRON MOUNTAIN!!! Love seeing 3 days of solid gains after earnings. Looking forward to seeing a $50 print and a divvy increase at some point. Remember, IRM consistently increased the divvy for many years up to Dec 2019, where it has remained since. With Project Summit yielding major savings, some of that will eventually flow to the divvy. Giddy up!!"
Greeting….I purchased IRM at $30 mainly for dividends. I’m pleasantly surprised at the increased. Should I be worried about a huge decline or stay the course?
GOTTA love this company and management!
"With successful investments like IRM in my portfolio, and the wealth of information on the web, I wonder why people need a financial planner? Do any of you see a benefit?"
IRM Long - this company has a wide array of services and quite a unique niche for protecting assets of all types. It's been around for a long time. They are 'the answer' when you need doc destruction now! Storage of vital data in varied formats that can be transferred to new media on a schedule to ensure data is not lost when a storage media fails/degrades (yes CDs and drives do degrade over decades) - buy now! :)
The time has come this morning at 10:15 to resume the upward trend for IRM. It was beaten down and is now getting back the recognition it deserves. Back into the 30s soon.
REITs in general are getting hammered today - likely due to the 10 year yield.
"A recent recommendation from Gilman Hill Asset Management CEO Jenny Harrington! She highlighted this in early June on CNBC’s Halftime Report. Jenny talks, smart investors should listen! THANK YOU AGAIN JENNY!"
I've accumulated a good number of $IRM shares today! 31 is a great entry point for me as I can leave those money alone... Dividend is not going anywhere soon!!!
Now an owner. Bought in @34.99 with dividends from other stocks. Seems like a good place to collect a stable dividend. How do you guys enjoy owning IRM?
"I bought this at $27 when it dipped last year, plan to hold it for many, many years since I bought it when it was paying a 9% dividend."
"We create stockholder value through high-margin brands and a disciplined acquisition strategy, and by returning a meaningful portion of our excess cash to our stockholders."
"Great numbers in times like these and dividend is safe!On August 5, 2020, Iron Mountain's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.6185 per share for the third quarter.

Hopefully the run up to 41 bucks awoke a sleeping giant
Their revenue grew from $3 billion in 2015 to $4.23 billion in 2018 which is pretty impressive. That is why I am long add add shares on big dips and love the dividend. Continued growth is why I don't believe the dividend will not go down plus they only pay 4.5% for credit at this time. Do your own DD
"I worked for IRM, this is a great income generator if you're looking for steady income. where can you get 8% yield?"
"Iron Mountain Q2 FFO of $0.69 beats by $0.05.Revenue of $1.12B (+14.1% Y/Y) beats by $30M.Adjusted EBITDA was up 12.8% Y/Y to $405.63M.FY21 guidance has revenue of $4.415B-4.515B (prior: $4.365B-4.515B) compared to the $4.42B consensus and FFO of $3.33-3.45 (prior: $3.28-3.45).Another solid Earnings Report. This crazy market doesn't always support a good report like this in the short term, but IRM is showing that it's a great long term investment."
Extremely low internal cash flow to fund growth
IRM is a solid company. I bought too early though. $29.73 per share
Headed to the mid 40s and beyond. Solid dividend for years to come.
been on this Rollercoaster a few years. the dividend keeps on coming. will stick with it
"I’m in! Grabbed 400 yesterday. I couldn’t pass up the 8% yield at these levels. I have been watching this for a long time, now I plan to own for a long time. I will DRIP the dividends for 6 years or so and then start collecting."
