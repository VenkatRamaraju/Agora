5% drop on no news???
Was expecting this news that LEG would change 2020 guidance. Big question....will the dividend be impacted?
I have owned this stock for 20 plus years and made more than my money back on the dividends alone. At today's closing price it's trading around 3 times more than what I paid. Not exactly amazon.. good enough for me.
Question is will they raise the dividend before the year is out and keep the streak going?
This is not a stock you hold long-term. Keep sliding….
"Questioning why Leggett jumped back into the foam business as their largest-to-date acquisition when they have already failed miserably with a previous foam enterprise. CEO (who I really like) seems in a quandary why the financial community is less than thrilled, even though foam mattresses can be obtained from any number of domestic and import sources....and likely cheaper than Leggett (who will certainly bridle the channels they will sell to, thus failing to capitalize on the potential in the category). Over the past 20 years LEG has a tendency to burn up cash buying market share in a given product category, invariably only to let it dribble away over time to price competition. That is what has happened with ventures into aluminum, textiles, bedding support, and adjustable beds. With a 21% YTD drop in stock price, I was thrilled to see LEG remain stable (+17c) with higher-than-average volume today, even in the wake of yet another dramatic drop in the broad market. Perhaps the bottom has hit....and we can expect a bounce? I really like Leggett...and hope this time they know something nobody else does...."
"Anyone share the theory that people like myself will begin looking for American manufactured furnishings? I've got a chair (no doubt) sitting in one of those containers off-shore in Long Beach. I ordered it in May. Yes, ""Made in China"". I own LEG as part of a steady retiree cash flow but now think it may show some growth."
I want to add more but want it cheaper still.
Bought 100 shares today good luck to all
Wow ... beat in both ways!
"Nice company, if we did not have a virus with no vaccine for at least a year. Hope they can hold out for that long as not too many going to buy furniture when they are unemployed... Afraid we will see $12 before we see $55 again."
As long as they keep paying and raising the dividend I could care less where the stock price is. When insiders buy I’ll load up as well. The last time insiders bought on the open market was when the stock was in the low-mid teens. The timing couldn’t have been any better.
Great stock for reinvesting dividends for the long haul. Been a shareholder for a very long time.
"Once again, I told you so. Never buy and hold this stock unless you want lame returns. Buy in sub $40 hold six months and repeat...."
"sold in november for 53, bought back today for 25 :D"
So LEG will no longer be a Dividend Aristicrat since its not raising its dividend? (They are keeping it at same rate as last 4 quarters)
Oh man it’s a rocket!!!!!
"Very long term holder here. Reinvest the dividends into more LEG. Wash, Rinse, Repeat."
got upgraded
"BOOM !! Beautiful multi top break above $46.12. I'd feel much better if volume was in the 1.5 million range. Targeting $48.72 then a shot at the low to mid $50s. I'm in the March $45 Calls. Targeting $3.80 with a potential to $6+ on or before ex dividend. The monkey wench would be a market pulling back, or selling off. Fingers crossed. Trade green my friends [_] cheers [_]"
