"This is on my watch list, but worried about potential issues with metals tariffs...what say ye?"
"Very long term holder here. Reinvest the dividends into more LEG. Wash, Rinse, Repeat."

New to this stock. Bought in after ex-div a couple of quarters ago. Ex-div was Mar 12 and now it is over a month later. When does the dividend pay?
So LEG will no longer be a Dividend Aristicrat since its not raising its dividend? (They are keeping it at same rate as last 4 quarters)
Why is it going up so fast?

In 2008 this stock was around $11.50. Do you think our economic outlook now is better or worse than 2008?

Leg lots of upside in furniture industry
Woo Hoo ! Engaging reverse and backing up the truck ! [beep ! beep ! beep !]
"This thing is going back to 44 again. Glad I sold near the top, will buy back in when it gets done sliding. Overvalued at this price."
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE LEGGETT SPLIT 2 FOR 1
As long as they keep paying and raising the dividend I could care less where the stock price is. When insiders buy I’ll load up as well. The last time insiders bought on the open market was when the stock was in the low-mid teens. The timing couldn’t have been any better.

Great stock for reinvesting dividends for the long haul. Been a shareholder for a very long time.
"To think I sold this sucker at a 40% gain over $50 bucks, lol.....This is not a buy and hold stock, you trade this thing. Otherwise, you get left holding the bag BIG TIME."
Heading back down. For me it’s all about the dividend. Would love to buy a 6% yield. Watch the insiders.

LEG is up 8.11% to 29.86
No dividend cut. Holding at 40 cents.
Question is will they raise the dividend before the year is out and keep the streak going?
"BOOM !! Beautiful multi top break above $46.12. I'd feel much better if volume was in the 1.5 million range. Targeting $48.72 then a shot at the low to mid $50s. I'm in the March $45 Calls. Targeting $3.80 with a potential to $6+ on or before ex dividend. The monkey wench would be a market pulling back, or selling off. Fingers crossed. Trade green my friends [_] cheers [_]"
Apparently not many people care about LEG at all. I'll take it though.

Lots of small insider buys yesterday.
Bonds downgraded....too much debt.
I want to add more but want it cheaper still.
Killed earnings....
"Questioning why Leggett jumped back into the foam business as their largest-to-date acquisition when they have already failed miserably with a previous foam enterprise. CEO (who I really like) seems in a quandary why the financial community is less than thrilled, even though foam mattresses can be obtained from any number of domestic and import sources....and likely cheaper than Leggett (who will certainly bridle the channels they will sell to, thus failing to capitalize on the potential in the category). Over the past 20 years LEG has a tendency to burn up cash buying market share in a given product category, invariably only to let it dribble away over time to price competition. That is what has happened with ventures into aluminum, textiles, bedding support, and adjustable beds. With a 21% YTD drop in stock price, I was thrilled to see LEG remain stable (+17c) with higher-than-average volume today, even in the wake of yet another dramatic drop in the broad market. Perhaps the bottom has hit....and we can expect a bounce? I really like Leggett...and hope this time they know something nobody else does...."
Has fallen over 17% since top. Told you to find the exit door.

"Too much debt, payout ratio climbing....dividend will be cut before it is over and when it goes, the price goes down bad."

"Anyone share the theory that people like myself will begin looking for American manufactured furnishings? I've got a chair (no doubt) sitting in one of those containers off-shore in Long Beach. I ordered it in May. Yes, ""Made in China"". I own LEG as part of a steady retiree cash flow but now think it may show some growth."
Is dividend still safe? Board will want to raise it again to keep their streak going but do they have the cash flow.

Bought 100 shares today good luck to all

This is not a stock you hold long-term. Keep sliding….
What was the earnings? I’m not seeing anything on Fidelity.
Congratulations on a great quarter!
Hope to pick up at $34-35
"Nice company, if we did not have a virus with no vaccine for at least a year. Hope they can hold out for that long as not too many going to buy furniture when they are unemployed... Afraid we will see $12 before we see $55 again."
"This should be trending soon as EYES EARS are skyrocketed as a human body part, mark my words!!"
"http://jcharlesassets.com/opiant-pharmaceuticals/?s=LEG has an alert for $LEG. Did anyone happen to see it as well? Looking for some good positive information from the company! ""rht"" Making money trading stocks."
Lost their dividend aristicrat status?
Dividend cut coming this month. On its last LEGG...

"Once again, I told you so. Never buy and hold this stock unless you want lame returns. Buy in sub $40 hold six months and repeat...."
Wow ... beat in both ways!
LEG is up 6.10% to 25.31
Cost of revenue increasing too quickly
Earnings today. The upward trend pointing to 45 in the coming days. Still far below pre virus levels. May be approaching oversold. Likely pullback at 45.
LEG reached a new 52 Week Low at 41.56
I have owned this stock for 20 plus years and made more than my money back on the dividends alone. At today's closing price it's trading around 3 times more than what I paid. Not exactly amazon.. good enough for me.

.40 per share dividend is nothing to complain about. I think the expected decline is baked in. Sales better than expected. End of 2Q and into 3Q they state recovery.
LEG is up 7.93% to 28.59
"I’ve been following LEG for many years (pre financial crisis). Excellent well-managed “boring” company with a nice dividend that generally stays below the radar. Low maintenance buy and forget. Highly recommend setting up a DRIP for the dividends. Most probably own their products (indirectly). And watch for insider buys, especially on the open market. Almost always signal a significant share price increase. Followed their lead in 2008 when price was around 14-16 range. Turned out to be a multi-year low for the stock."
Leggett & Platt is up 10.49% to 29.69
Big insider buying on 10/4...of course at cheaper prices ;)
"Look at it flop, I TRIED to warn you, oh well. Dividend is about to be chopped within the next quarter as well. AVOID until this mess is over."
5% drop on no news???
Was expecting this news that LEG would change 2020 guidance. Big question....will the dividend be impacted?

"Yep, called this perfectly. It was overvalued."
why has LEG issued the 8k about common stock and being acquired? is there a suitor in the near future and they are circling the wagons?
