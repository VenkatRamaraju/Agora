Is this about done dropping?
Apparently not many people care about LEG at all. I'll take it though.
This is not a stock you hold long-term. Keep sliding….
LEG is down 9.32% to 27.49
Wow ... beat in both ways!
Leggett & Platt is down 4.99% to 43.61

Absolutely ridiculous but I will take it. Hard to be a buy and hold investor on days like this :D
"I'm waiting on 36-37 to buy more, let's see if it shows up..."
LEG is up 9.20% to 27.66
LEG is down 4.91% to $36.63
I have owned this stock for 20 plus years and made more than my money back on the dividends alone. At today's closing price it's trading around 3 times more than what I paid. Not exactly amazon.. good enough for me.
Leggett & Platt is up 11.42% to 29.65
Leggett & Platt is up 4.90% to 41.95
Leggett & Platt is down 4.90% to 44.03
And the dividend increase brings the yield to 4.16% on May 10.
Hope to pick up at $34-35
All these guys do is give themselves discount stock
Currently overvalued... as are most stocks currently.
Leg lots of upside in furniture industry
"This should be trending soon as EYES EARS are skyrocketed as a human body part, mark my words!!"

LEG reached a new 52 Week Low at 40.63
why has LEG issued the 8k about common stock and being acquired? is there a suitor in the near future and they are circling the wagons?

"I'm disappointed, I wanted it to go down so I could buy more :P"
LEG is down 7.26% to 26.07
Earnings today. The upward trend pointing to 45 in the coming days. Still far below pre virus levels. May be approaching oversold. Likely pullback at 45.

Is dividend still safe? Board will want to raise it again to keep their streak going but do they have the cash flow.
"Once again, I told you so. Never buy and hold this stock unless you want lame returns. Buy in sub $40 hold six months and repeat...."
Leggett & Platt is up 6.02% to 31.52
"BOOM !! Beautiful multi top break above $46.12. I'd feel much better if volume was in the 1.5 million range. Targeting $48.72 then a shot at the low to mid $50s. I'm in the March $45 Calls. Targeting $3.80 with a potential to $6+ on or before ex dividend. The monkey wench would be a market pulling back, or selling off. Fingers crossed. Trade green my friends [_] cheers [_]"
Heading back down. For me it’s all about the dividend. Would love to buy a 6% yield. Watch the insiders.
got upgraded
Cost of revenue increasing too quickly
5% drop on no news???

New to this stock. Bought in after ex-div a couple of quarters ago. Ex-div was Mar 12 and now it is over a month later. When does the dividend pay?
Dividend cut coming this month. On its last LEGG...
"Very long term holder here. Reinvest the dividends into more LEG. Wash, Rinse, Repeat."
LEG is up 4.92% to 48.43
What was the earnings? I’m not seeing anything on Fidelity.
In 2008 this stock was around $11.50. Do you think our economic outlook now is better or worse than 2008?
Killed earnings....
Leggett & Platt is up 4.93% to 46.38
As long as they keep paying and raising the dividend I could care less where the stock price is. When insiders buy I’ll load up as well. The last time insiders bought on the open market was when the stock was in the low-mid teens. The timing couldn’t have been any better.
"Perhaps margin could be imprved, nice dividend"
Was expecting this news that LEG would change 2020 guidance. Big question....will the dividend be impacted?
"The poor saps that bought at 52, omg...."
"Nice company, if we did not have a virus with no vaccine for at least a year. Hope they can hold out for that long as not too many going to buy furniture when they are unemployed... Afraid we will see $12 before we see $55 again."

"\/ Never mind, IC they sold the aluminum business. \/"
Question is will they raise the dividend before the year is out and keep the streak going?
.40 per share dividend is nothing to complain about. I think the expected decline is baked in. Sales better than expected. End of 2Q and into 3Q they state recovery.

"sold in november for 53, bought back today for 25 :D"

"I’ve been following LEG for many years (pre financial crisis). Excellent well-managed “boring” company with a nice dividend that generally stays below the radar. Low maintenance buy and forget. Highly recommend setting up a DRIP for the dividends. Most probably own their products (indirectly). And watch for insider buys, especially on the open market. Almost always signal a significant share price increase. Followed their lead in 2008 when price was around 14-16 range. Turned out to be a multi-year low for the stock."

HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE LEGGETT SPLIT 2 FOR 1
So LEG will no longer be a Dividend Aristicrat since its not raising its dividend? (They are keeping it at same rate as last 4 quarters)

"This thing is going back to 44 again. Glad I sold near the top, will buy back in when it gets done sliding. Overvalued at this price."
"Questioning why Leggett jumped back into the foam business as their largest-to-date acquisition when they have already failed miserably with a previous foam enterprise. CEO (who I really like) seems in a quandary why the financial community is less than thrilled, even though foam mattresses can be obtained from any number of domestic and import sources....and likely cheaper than Leggett (who will certainly bridle the channels they will sell to, thus failing to capitalize on the potential in the category). Over the past 20 years LEG has a tendency to burn up cash buying market share in a given product category, invariably only to let it dribble away over time to price competition. That is what has happened with ventures into aluminum, textiles, bedding support, and adjustable beds. With a 21% YTD drop in stock price, I was thrilled to see LEG remain stable (+17c) with higher-than-average volume today, even in the wake of yet another dramatic drop in the broad market. Perhaps the bottom has hit....and we can expect a bounce? I really like Leggett...and hope this time they know something nobody else does...."

"It was this same price in 1997, lol. I've said it before, this is a good stock to trade, you don't buy and hold. It goes nowhere long-term."
