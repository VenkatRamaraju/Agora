$10.95 beat. $9.35 estimate.
what exactly is the dividend?
"Can't help but love steady BLK... Earnings wonderful as usual. Management took advantage of undervalued shares to buy back more stock than planned. The company is more valuable than it was just 3 months ago. That's all I'm looking for. Selfishly, would love to see another drop below $400 so I can quickly build position to desired amount. Good luck BLK longs!"
"Black rock and vanguard both just released sec fillings that they both have big stakes inside of Novavax, a clinical stage BIOTECH company that’s is about to announce phase 3 clinical trials any day now before Q1 is over!! Also NVAXs president just acquired a bunch more shares 11 days ago!!! Do your duo diligence now could hit $25 once possible PH3 results are announced."
what's behind BLK fast and furious run?
"I am wondering if there is anybody could explain why BlackRock's stock price met the massive selloff and dropped 7.84% today, thanks."
Some talk of Blacktock hiding short position in ETF with AMC stock. I am done with this stock and the company. So sad that black rock of all companies could be shady.

"Stock split soon, hopefully. 3 for 1 would be cool"
Looking forward to a lot of buying today at BlackRock $
I am indeed very blessed that I bought 557 shares of BLK on Friday. Its a tall building and its smart to take shelter in Hurricane in Tall rather then in a small 1 floor building.
Looks like it’s gonna be uptrend as we enter into the ER. 1000 here we come!

"Guys, help me understand this pls: BLK is valued at 108bi, and they currently hold ~1bi AAPL shares, valued at +130bi... why is BLK so ""low""?"

BLK $900 Eow!!
BLK is killing my port lately. At first I thought it was just following the sector. Soros has no real effect. Fundamentals are looking expensive compared to others in the sector. Too soon for any earnings news to move the price. Volume is low. I'm holding for now but taking profits is starting to sound good
"Oopsy, better reconsider your plan of investing more in the Chinese market next time"
"I own the financials.. $GS $C $JEF $COF $BK $BLK ...adding when I can to all of them. $MS is quickly becoming my favorite horse in the race. Additionally, I'll be holding $GBTC $ETHE $MARA $MSTR $RIOT ...probably....forever. gl2a."
"nice beat, great quater!"
"Valuation on the run of epic proportions --- How can a restaurant reach an all-time high during a pandemic?? Oh right, a couple of hedge funds that keep the stock price high with volume low. $BLK will have to sell some of their long exposure soon or they will be headed right to the slaughterhouse. When they do, the bloodbath begins."
This board was quiet forever and look at it now trading near all-time highs... Seems the chase crowd has found BLK.
up after hours. big guys know they want in before a huge beat

Looks like it may go down to around 810. It has broken 50 day and 100 day MA. 200 day MA is around 810. Hopefully it will bounce back then
CEO’s name fits the way Blackrock makes money. All Banksters that make or produce nothing and live off of others’ efforts but they want to tell others how to live!
A joke at this price period. Too much downside period. Small dividend too much risk period. Whole market got so over priced here period. Would not but anything here period. Just buying thinking there will be a stimulus. Another scam to get buyers to push up stocks. We are so over priced once again . Nasdaq needs several thousands correction here.
BEAT...
So BlacRock owns 6.46% of its own shares. What does that actually mean?

time to buy or sell need intelligence discussion .
total 550 shares now I do not think what stock I am buying because BLK hold them all like a vanguard
I wish I knew how to short this stock because Blackrock is among one of the largest buyers of Evergrande debt.

Need some input here…so you think BLK will be 950 by December?

Time for change. And when they were up they were up and when they were down they were down .

Why is it down so much after hours?
Just bought my first share! And it went down as always. I’m in for 5 years and plan on buying in the dips next time.
Yesterday and today nearly 3% down tho it beats earnings 
In uncertain market its best to buy and hold BLK shares.

China has a 60 trillion mutual fund market. How is it a fatal error to to to tap into that a little? If he is concerned about his clients then why trash BLK at the end of a long weekend right before trading resumes? That actually hurts the stock immediately.

Great company with strong management. i think they will also raise the dividend as usual. 1100 in a year.
BLK is a money making machine. Back to $800 in no time and $1000 before the end of 2021.

I'm up 40% during the 6 months I held BLK. Do you think it's fairly valued now? It's been flatlining the past couple of weeks. p/s went over 8
if it goes a bit lower it has broken the trendchannel so I wouldn't buy at this moment.

"Here is exactly what gave all the investors confidence in BLK, no matter you are experienced institutional holders or passive index fund managers - Larry Fink explicitly indicated on the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call on Friday 01/12/18 that ""13 countries and 68 different products generated more than $1 billion of net inflows. BlackRock's technology is now used by clients in 50 countries."" And ""...as you know, last year, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We're committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio and, obviously, over time, paying out the balance of excess cash in the form of buybacks.""That is exactly how the BLK long-term stakeholders will get rewarded substantially if you can hold on tight through the months. When the income statement comes out in April, you will see why and how this 6.3 trillion company is still possibly the ""80s microsoft"" of this New Decade."

"blk rule the world,for the long term it is the best buy ever"
hi
"I was asked a very good question regarding my choice to invest in Blackrock. The question was: if you believe in the power of investing in ETFs, in other words, the potential of gaining wealth by owning a basket of stocks or bonds or individual commodities, why would you invest in a single stock (BLK) and not practice what you preach and put your money on any of the ETPs?My answer is simple, I don’t proclaim to be smart enough to know which investment vehicle will outperform in the next year or two. In the long term I believe precious metals will be much higher, Gold might even be worth more than $100,000, other commodities like oil will also be higher, stocks will be higher too. The point is that, to me, all these investments will be higher and although I am not sure which ones will outperform the other, the one thing I know for sure is that the medium in which these investments will be accessed will overwhelmingly be through ETPs.Sure, I can purchase the Gold, Oil, S&P, Nasdaq and all other major index products domestic or foreign out there. But isn’t it better to own the “miner” of these investments? If Blackrock was not a public traded company, I guess I would definitely purchase the 5 or 10 or 20 different ETF’s in my portfolio too. And I am sure much smarter professionals and more daring than me, will choose to bet on specific markets to do better than others. They might even be smart enough to invest in leveraged ETFs to enhance their returns. However, the fact still remains that one of the few alternatives out there to owning anything other than ETPs and not individual stocks, is Blackrock. The issuer of ETPs. The only other few choices out there other than ETPs are the index providers like CME and trading platforms like Schwab and also perhaps payment platforms like Mastercard or Paypal."
Aug BLK low 739 Sep above 925 today low 856 bought 11 shares how low BLK will go due to investment in China (news)
looks like the market does not like the fee reduction. (i wish yahoo could deputize someone to delete all the spam on this board)
i wonder why this board is so empty on such a great stock?
$1000 coming up. The amount of money these guys handle will make your head spin.Larger than the GDP of some G7 countries.Unbelievable almost.
BLK only has $394M in Evergrande exposure. The stock lost billions in market cap because of this. I think BLK heads higher.
BLK...stay out of politics and social engineering. We do not invest in you for that. Do what you do best...make money and grow.

This company has a long history in helping the CCP and strengthen our biggest enemy in history.
How is no one really talking about this stock?
Does anybody know what policy Jeff Smith didn't adhere to?
So a few thoughts that make me worried. Large Asset managers are chasing flow growth at any price and seeking to grow in less liquid or private markets as there is less transparency and so the asset manager keeps some pricing power. There is way too much money chasing this. So what happens when inflation and interest rates ( which are real impacts on people ) both go up or borrowing gets harder. I think the drive for more flow from global ETF providers is the source of the next downturn but it won’t be the ETF it will be another department that was tasked with fee growth to compensate for the flow drive
What just happened?
Yes 3 for 1 OR 2 for 1 would be GREAT news.

My answer to all of the above is, I believe the below five stocks will be the top performers of the S&P for the next six months (I refer to the picks as BPMCS):BLACKROCK $BLKPAYPAL $PYPLMASTERCARD $MACME GROUP $CMECHARLES SCHWAB $SCHWBPMCS stocks might have performed 15% YTD vs 40% of the FAANG stocks, BPMCS has however, half the forward P/E multiple than FAANG and almost double the ROE.Again, I’m not predicting that FAANG will do poorly from now on, all I’m prognosticating is that BPMCS will be the top 5 performing stocks in the S&P from now till the end of the year.AP"

PNC sold their shares to BLK for $414. Why is this stock a lot higher? Wouldn’t that mean that they deem this a fair price?
My issue with BLK is that the leaders are mostly focused on political success that fuels Blk earnings rather than success that fuels clients success . I get all the good stuff but it’s in the price and the world has changed so why is it ok to offer index and ETF products that invest in destructive companies but then state how important ESG is .
"Way to make me eat my words BLK!! Glad to see the strong bounce back today so congrats to those that held thru! Fortunately for me, the position I added to from these funds is doing even better so far and should continue. Good--Good.... I'll be back!"
this stock has been red every day for 2 weeks now
Thanks Larry! I added during the last dip. Keep printing money with upcoming rate hikes!

$1000 looks good by end of the year
"It is often puzzling to me how BLK has become the talk on the street “Blackrock is down some 220 dollars!” From $590 to $380. Yet no one mentions that $MS for instance, is down from $59 to $43. The large number fallacy here is taking its toll."

"I’m only 3 months into trading, once I started with https://stockhaul.today/BTFDeBook and actually listening to the regulars on here , my performance almost doubled! It also lets you search to find unique stocks with relative strength outperforming the markets."
"I just Bought. This is too strong of a company.... LOW P/E, lots of growth... Rock Solid dividend... Juicy Profits..."
"Blk is still overpriced . Cutting fees on ETF business , volumes down year on year , blk market share falling in ETFs, costs up year on year so do you sacrifice margin or people . We all know New York blk does not like people"
Sold it. I made 30% in 6 months in BLK. Didn't like the trend lately and some of the fundamentals show it's reasonably priced now
I sold half a position at 578. Cost basis is 200. $6000 incoming tax -_-
"The Fee Income streams are stronger compared to Year 2016 and BlackRock Portfolio of Products have been fully diversified across the markets. For the most recent three quarters there are more and more Sovereign Funds joined BLK which have long-term revenue streams (6.2 Trillions AUM). Those large funds are stable clients and the results will show positively on the income statement around April, 17, 2018, not to mention the direct performance incentive results due to the appreciation of global equity markets for the past twelve months. You will be pleasantly surprised when BLK aggressively implements the 1 to 2 billions Common Share Buy-Back Program. Our view is that the first three months of Year 2018 will be the best quarter yet in BLK's history, with potential for even higher dividends payout in subsequent quarters. Solid year over year AUM increase, bigger book value, reduced shares outstanding, differentiated global offerings, larger gross margin, entrenched relationship with the 10 largest and wealthy countries, reduced headcounts and focused execution will make BLK the indisputably number one cash cow for the remaining years of the Trump Administration owning to both the Tax Reform and the concentration of wealth back to the industry leaders. Institutions still prefer stable brands and double digit growth rates."
"Eevn Joe Kernen got Larry Fink back on his heels. fascinating listening to Fink. He has a vision for many areas especially environmental. Yet he seems to be less upfront on China- environmental, crack down on Chinese technology. BLK is huge in China so he seems to pull punches."
this company lost 250m holding evergrande stock.
"BLK drop 28 % so far I thought good fundamental stock but not do not dare to add on , it had been drop every day in 5 consecutive day."
This stock has outperformed all major indexes for the last 20y! And it pays almost 2% DIV. Looks like it's a winner long term! Wish I invested in it long time ago.

"my wood get so stiff when I think that I actually bought just after IPO, never sold any of orginal purchase."
There's been a large sell order at the close for the past week.
"Not sure how I feel about the data issue at BLK . I need to consider and calculate my thoughts . I think bigger volumes of flows both in and out of funds or ETFs and versus bigger flow expectations is the real issue. How can Blk be less market dependent is a question I will try and answer. The increasing issue of greater flows to demonstrate user and usage growth is too much and fee compression is now savage . Blk is well placed but that doesn’t mean it will go up as a share . I remain a bear in the short term. They need to double the headcount reduction and remove some of the top heavy layers and replace them with technology . Down first I think . Conclusion is expectations too high , volume versus intention to market linked , fee pressure ugly , top heavy in management . But they will be looking to invest and buy so let’s see"
"BlackRock,Inc. Owns mega millions of shares of ( GIS ) General Mills with a great 4.3% dividend and 18 % undervalued. A great time for BlackRock To buy a boat load of GIS"

Q: How the US Government is PUMPING the Stock Prices Artificially?Answer: The US Government allows Market Makers to use Infinite Margin trading desks to buy US Stock Indexes to PUMP the Stock prices Artificially! It is Digital Money Printing!The system is BROKEN however. It is not a one way stream. You cannot print money and PUMP the Stock prices forever to give away Trillions of US Dollars in the form of Capital Gains. It is a PONZI SCHEME!$AAPL $BLK
"Remember the good ol' days when BLK issued a quarterly report and the stock went Up 3%, not down 3%.Activist Fink, eh ? Larry, you can't serve 10 masters. Maybe J Powell can just use BLK stock chart to plot money supply trajectory ?"
"Just like that, another all-time high. BLK tends to make these moves in stealth mode. Expect the $800 mark to be hit prior to EOD. Well done BlackRock; happy long time investor in your shares."
"BLK drop to be able to buy 841 to 839 unable to buy, drop from X~Div. 915 , Is it have anything to dowith lost money in China? Is any guest how low can it be , will it be 800? need info."
