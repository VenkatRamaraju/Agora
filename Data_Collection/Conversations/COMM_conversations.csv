2 more insiders purchase making 3 total all over 25k shares adding a meaningful position
"There's little reason to believe this company will ever do anything for shareholders. It's part of some companies' corporate culture, not others."
Finally!! This should be a $ 40 stock at least!
"The total enterprise value (debt and equity combined) of the combined entity is now less than the equity value alone of the previous stand-alone companies (about 5BB each.) Put another way, it's as if the total equity value of one and half of the other was completely wiped out in a little over half a year. Pretty amazing rate of value destruction."
Slow but green. TD Ameritrade has it at $.06 in the positive at the opening. I will take it.
They had some interesting insights about COMM on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Not sure if they are selling this off but at this price makes for a great entry
Hut diggety
easy come ease go
Time to buy folks. Its hit an inflection point.
Is there a investor day on Tuesday?
COMM is down 10.56% to 12.96
"Much improvement, reducing debt on track, early merger results encouraging, 5G coming. Analysts will soon see compelling earnings expansion and much more favorable forecast. Good entry point for long term investors."
The presidents comment that internet access for all citizens was great news!! Will help COMM!!
Goldman Sachs upgrade.....every little bit helps
Looks like I shouldn't of sold half my shares yesterday. Thought it was done on earnings. I guess not . Still long though.
The best play for them is to sell the set top box business....use this money to pay down debt.
New all-time low.
It’s possible some institutions will not allow quarterly guidance only and due to policies must sell?
"UOIP....Tick tock tick tock...COMM is first in line for infringement firing squad for UOIP patents. Big boys bailing quietly, Cisco and UOIP attended settlement talks, court documented, soon COMM will get out that checkbook"
Hit 15 by options expiration like I thought it would. Now wondering about next earnings call and guidance
continues to reduce debt and doesn't promote its future value. Sure Carlyle is very actively involved to protect their investment .would never bet against them and short the stock.Frank Drendel is still Chairman and gave birth to this company and is biggest stockholder. Shareholders will be rewarded if they have a longer term horizon.
ARRIS product line will benefit from the new demand for increased WIFI at residences.
Seems like the stock gods didn't dig the earnings.
why down even after good news?
Justin choi out.

"CommScope just had more layoffs and a another BU mgmt reorg. The place is crashing hard and don’t be surprised when they sell off product lines that don’t fit the model anymore. (Broadband, Arris minus Rokus). Time for the c-suite to be gone.."
They need to announce timeline to reinstate annual guidance and raise sell prices/cut costs....pretty simple formula.
I think the COMMSCOPE Management has done a good job cleaning house. Looks like the finance org has been purged with the bad players gone. Sometime it takes time. I am hearing about good people coming into the company. As I stated before they really need to shrink the real estate portfolio- a terrific source of improving cash flow-especially Horsham and Sawnee. I don't see a problem giving out bonuses-in that you really need to attract and keep good people. Perhaps it is time to jettison the shrinking home business-I never understood the ARRIS passion for being the dominant player in set top boxes but that business has seen its day. This company has a place in digital-if they can execute I think there are some good opportunities.
I upgraded home internet speed......got a new ARRS modem/router......kids home school needed upgrade....I think this will show in the sales as a lot of people doing this.
From my perspective this stock is going to be stuck for a while. Again I see no serious programs to cut expenses. The overhead of the Chanbond liability. The basic changes going on in the cable industry-more software vs cable boxes hence the lower sales in a lot of devices and cable cutting are hitting some of the profitable business unit. While 5g has a lot of potential not sure how quick that is going to happen.
"From my perspective the debt load on this company-the lack of action to get costs under control is not good. I think it is nice to think 5G will save this company but a lot of competition. Then of course a lot more risk-patent issue, management, even talent drain. A lot has to happen to make this company a success-not sure this team can do it. I am moving on-good luck to all."
"UOIP lawsuit making progress towards trial date, just had Supreme Court appeal ruling done with Cisco. COMM is the first and possibly the worst to get hammered for infringement of patents held by UOIP. That’s why stock dropped after going up after earnings, the next day the ruling came out."
"This stock can’t rally in this market, that’s a problem"
"This company could hardly ask for better tailwinds - the pandemic is increasing demand for connectivity generally and the rollout of 5G networks continues, with an emphasis on finding non-PRC suppliers. So far though, the company is too burdened by debt to benefit."
Another good day with lots of green until you look at COMM... back in the 10's
anyone think comm has potential into the future? I thought it was good news this morning. bought at 10.25 then 8.25 to average out. hopefully there are longs out there supporting this company
"Esteban, COMM has always been notoriously conservative. My “hope” is that they set the revenue bar low in order to make sure they hit it next Q. Once the carriers start to ramp up for 5G spend, this should take off and become a flier."
What a #$%$!!! You still thinking $25-$30 is on the horizon? Lol
A possible sale of one of the business units in the works.....only reason for this bullish movement.
"194million shares outstanding, 6% is 11.6 million which is 3-5 days float based on time period you look at. Regardless, at some point , these positions have to be closed by buying in shares. I agree current short position Is not bearish and probably slightly bullish. litigation, delay in 5G and decrease capital expenditures by their customers is a temporary bump in the road."
"Comm dudes must be going broke the way stock sold off. I thought we had insider buys. Looks like we're all bag holder and these guys go out of business with products in the ports or someplace. Downgrade city. Analyst dudes downgrade , looks like a disaster. Who care about debt it's sales and if no products to sell your punked"
"just named new CEO and board chairman. New vision and leadership might be what this company needs. close to turning corner but needs to be more focused and increase unleveraging . All this debt, even at extremely low rates, ties their hands relative to other opportunities"
great news! With the buyout even more good news to come!
"The way this is trading, independent of market and sector action and forging new lows on strong days, I think we have to wonder if the market is signaling the company might end up in the hands of creditors. even with over 2BB in equity remaining, revenue isn't growing and the debt may be unsustainable. The merger might have killed it."
Success!!
The input I am getting is that the company is in chaos. While I believe there is a need for restructuring this looks like too crazy to me. I think I will stay away.
"It's just a lousy company. They took on too much debt and didn't do their diligence on acquisitions, which failed almost immediately. I hope they do a writedown this quarter so analysts and investors can take their figures at face value going forward and they have a chance to rebuild."
-18%..wow..would hate to have seen a bad quarter result..
Stock is back to where it was practically before last earnings. See how it runs up to next earnings call. See if we can break 16.
FWIW:https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/commscope-does-not-look-like-an-attractive-play-now-15379620?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo(charting = astrology imo)
Commscope equity now has a lower price to sales ratio than CVS. It's still much higher than Gamestop though.
"Commscope is nothing more the quarter buy and dump. Mgmt has no clue.With the new leader, is Carlyle going to step in and take private again like 2011? Perfect time to right the ship and correct the habitual “F” up acquisitions they make."
buying opportinity or do I keep shorting?
"New/rolled over debt rated B3:https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-B3-rating-to-Commscopes-proposed-notes-offering--PR_426715?cid=HFGG75LYEO30&yptr=yahooStill too low:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_ratingCommscope will obviously never be an investment grade, but it's hard to imagine the equity ever having much value with the risk of default (and therefor 0 equity value) so high."
I expect announcement of debt funded.
"Not sure they should be buying anything considering the current equity valuation, debt position, and how early they are in integrating their recent merger."
CommScope has had a significant task pulling things together regarding the ARRIS merger. The Arris financial organization and supply chain were both very poorly run and really had to be cleaned up.Lots of waste and politics. The reorganization has really helped. I see a lot of opportunity with their stock as CommScope can focus on the spinoff and new opportunities..
CommScope Holding Is Maintained at Outperform by Credit Suisse9:17 AM ET 7/23/19 | Dow Jones
"I think they may have to raise capital, but how?"
fourth straight all-time intraday low.
"I bought more, figure we go up from here after several days after 20% drop."
"On CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" Jon Najarian said there was some rampant speculation in Commscope Holding Company Inc (NASDAQ: COMM). Early in the session, around 8,700 contracts of the August $10 calls were bought pretty quickly and later during the day, the volume moved up over 30,000 contracts. Najarian bought these calls and he is going to be in the position for three weeks.GLTA"
"Broke support at $13-ish. Next support around $11, half the June high."
"If the merger is approved, Nicoll anticipates a different outcome. “Samsung and Nokia are net winners here, along with Airspan and possibly Kathrein and CommScope,” he wrote. “Ericsson may see some decrease in the short-term, but when the 5G core finally goes commercial and RAN (radio access network) deployments expand, they will see business pick up.”"
"Very nice SP recovery going into earnings. Given the ongoing effort to reduce the debt mountain, I can see an SP of $18 min if estimates are exceeded."
"The drop in may- for not being able to give full year guidance. But now that arris deal is done, will books get aligned with sales? Will they beat er and pps to 20?"
Guidance less than half estimates. Stock could decrease by at least as much.
Would love to see Carlyle pop these shorts.
"Why these dudes up after hours up to over 16, 40 some cents, dunno"
missed eps by a penny and taken behind the woodshed and beaten. What did I miss in earnings release. I didn't listen to call so maybe something new was discussed? comments?
"COMM bought some patents. Don't understand them, don't know what they paid, or how they afforded to pay it. Hope it helps though."
"Be interesting to see if they talk about India and the recent shutdowns and restrictions esp since they have moved so many ones mfg ops lines and global ops (R&D, IT, Accounting functions, etc...) there. Many areas in India are only allowing essential workers out."
"A person who does not try, cannot succeed. http://dataunion.tistory.com/19252 I don't think of the past. The only thing that matters is the everlasting present."
"Commscope equity might have a lower price to sales ratio than CVS, but it's still higher than Luby's cafeteria. Luby's is having a good day though, so that could change."
"Doesn't make a ton of sense a stock trading at below a 10 pe ratio. Management said they wanted to raise share price. We will see. Didn't Claudius dude buy shares at over 15,??"
Market's not impressed:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commscope-realign-four-business-segments-163000049.html
rolling over debt - doesn't appear to be net add or reductionhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/commscope-commences-notes-offering-113000143.html
Upgrade!https://seekingalpha.com/news/3507169-nomura-becomes-commscope-bull
This is looking a little more like the COMM we've become too familiar with the past couple of years.
"Here comes $12s and then $10 is not far behind. Lol. This company is a shell of its former self. When the correction hits due to realization of higher inflation, good luck bag holders."
5 year chart very ugly. 1 year pretty ugly. 6 month - meh. 1 month - beautiful.
This new WIFI product is awesome! Best Buy will be selling.....pretty exciting!
"John I think you are correct. You see when Google cut the deal to spinoff GI from Motorola Mobility to Arris-Arris was a fraction of the size of GI. The companies didn't have the appropriate skills to pull things together. Also tremendous amount of politics. Then you throw on the other big acquisitions Arris was on a very shaky foundation. I think CommScope first has to get ARRIS under control and let everyone know they are part of Commscope-not various tribes - rationalize their products. I would shut down the facilities in Suwanee and Horsham to make people understand GI and ARRIS are no longer. I would keep reviewing the staff at the VP levels-to insure everyone is working as a team-and make sure there are standard systems, cost effective facilities, office standards and strict codes of conduct and expense management. Commscope has a good future and I think they are starting down the proper path but they have to be tough."
NOK up on bullish 5G......It's coming! We have a $ 60 billion market ahead.
clearly some shorts are profit taking......could easily rebound way more.
PE is down to 11 now. Time to buy in and collect 10% in May.
Anyone have any thoughts/insight on whether the recent bullishness is company-specific or just market momentum and stimulus anticipation.
This is purely on management to not announce a timeline to restore annual guidance.
I am looking for an entry point. Somewhat disappointed with the conference call. Savings goals too low for a company this size. I didn't care for actual cash flow. Let's see some real savings regarding consolidating the company. Again way too many offices.
"Slight uptick in shares short again, considering how many shares are held in funds (+/- 98%), I guess they're happy to lend them out to try to cut losses. Been awhile since I've seen such a parabolic move to the downside, makes you wonder who knows what."
"At this point I wonder if the best option is an equity capital raise. See if they can sell half a billion shares for 6. Sure it would dilute the hell out of us, but it would also allow them to pay down some debt and maybe invest in some innovation. I don't know if that press release today helps; that thing looks like a wifi hotspot on a Segway. I'd rather be diluted than wiped out."
Second reverse head and shoulder (in last 6 months) forming.
Olstein reports it's highly likely COMM will aquire ARRS.....geez really.
"If it breaks support at 13.60-13.80, it’s headed lower. Very long term investment at this point and maybe too long. Maybe a short term trade if it drops to 12?"
getting legs back.
"The issued was, There is no long-term guidance, Only quarterly projection."
Carlyle put $1 billion in this deal and took stock back. This is second time they have invested in Comcast and know company and management well. They don't make many mistakes and understand time it takes to reap ROI. Short term traders are controlling price but long term holders will be rewarded.
CommScope Holding Price Target Cut to $23.00/Share From $27.00 by Credit SuissePress Release: S&PGR Places CommScope Holding Co. Inc. Rtgs On Watch NegativeI guess 3rd quarter guidance is the problem.?.
"I didn't do enough research on CEO Marvin Edwards Jr. before investing. Not only has he failed to generate any shareholder value during his near-decade tenure as CEO and Chairman of COMM, but his prior positions were also at failed competitor Alcatel and Alcatel Lucent. Interestingly, it failed almost the same way - attempting to salvage uncompetitive technological positions through overpriced mergers with excessive debt. This also failed. The CEO has never been associated with a successful company from a shareholder perspective. He's 70 and unlikely to change much at this point. It difficult to imagine shareholders doing very well as long as he's in place."
That's six straight all-time intra-day lows.
How much could the pay out to UOIP be?? And when?? Or maybe just buy Them out.
Large new investor!
3rd quarter 2021 COMM price prediction......$ 40.00 + ...I wanted to go on record.
I heard about COMM the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"COMM is doing something with fiber optics that NO one can do. They can put more FIBER Connections in 1U 2U and 4U boxes. This is significant because data center real estate is all about space. How much space does that BOX NEED? The space that Cisco, Brocade, EMC, Dell , HP and everything from storage to network to servers. They all need FIBER. So old 1U Patch panel Could have 48 ports LC it can now have 96 LC. 2U Could have 96 BUT Now 144 and 4U Could have 192 but COMMSCOPE WILL now have 288 for their new 2018 versions. No one has this. Not even Corning themselves."
Calix(CALX)https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CALX/?p=CALX
"First bit of unambiguously good news in years. You don't have to pull the chart back very far to see we still have a long way to go for this to be a good investment for most holders, but we have to start somewhere. I'll take it."
That will be seven strait all-time intraday lows. Was hoping the management change was Edwards out.
Lol another debt rollover. They have a history of doing this more then the average company. Term must be coming up and they can’t pay it. Dead money here currently. Going back below $10 and then time to back up the truck.
"""We remain confident that, with ARRIS and Ruckus, we will grow faster than the industry and benefit from favorable networking market trends, while continuing to enhance shareholder value.""This is the kind of corporate happy talk management seems to feel obligated to make but it is disheartening nonetheless because of it's such obvious, blatant dishonesty. What's worse, those saying it know it's nonsense, those receiving it know, and those saying it know those receiving know.To get back to its IPO price it would have to appreciate ~25%. To reach the level of equity value the separate merged companies had less than a year ago, the stock would have to trade around 50, which will absolutely never happen.An admission of problems, of a permanent loss of capital, doesn't indicate an unwillingness to do better going forward and could even earn a struggling management team some credibility, but it rarely happens, certainly not here."
"year from now we'll regret not adding shares at this price. 5G, Carlyle and corporate capital expenditures will be on track. don't let current litigation, delay in 5G. Debt retirement is a must and successful integration of the merged companies. Comm is on sale at these prices if Management can just execute."
i hope they announce reinstatement of annual guidance....that will help.
"""Strength in Broadband Networks expected to accelerate throughout remainder of 2020""I think its going to retest its $16 in the next few months."
Thud.....we need good news!
Whoever told them it was a good idea to drop Annual Guidance needs to be fired.
The key to this stock is going to be how successful their integration of Arris is. The CommScope finance team has to really take charge of ARRIS and get costs down. I would like to see them close a lot of sites. Far too many-most of which are very under utilized. Too many vice presidents verses most organizations this size. Rationalization of the supply chain is it too centralized? Do you need more outsourcing? A lot of potential here if done correctly.
"After a pretty disastrous year this looks cheap on several metrics - P/S, EV/EBITA, even assuming those figures are a little inflated by the soon to be jettisoned set-top business."
Is there a chance COMM will go Private again?
twice the normal volume with an uptick. maybe a good sign or short covering
18 by Feb
Looking like a buy here soon?? Looks like last dip. See if it goes lower like July or like or bottoms here??
"IMO the only thing that can turn things around is a surprise to the upside in sales - an announcement that they are an integral part of a major carrier's 5G upgrade. Otherwise, its tough to see what else could drive it. Even if this were to trade at the same enterprise value to EBITA as JNPR, the stock would have to be around 10-11, and arguable this isn't as good a company as JNPR."
Big volume out of nowhere again on a flat day.

Company's done nothing for shareholders since going public.
Worst merger since AOL-Time Warner.
I am completely out! Hope this moves up for the rest of you folks. I am back in REITs completely.

This company was struggling to keep its head above water with a massive debt load before the pandemic. Will be interesting over the next 2-3 years to see if there is any equity value here at all. I think it's 50-50.
"Should of sold at open at 9.80, could buy back 3% lower. This thing seems like it goes up and down between 9.80 and 9 bucks like a yo yo."
"Although they did not reduce debt this quarter ,they did take advantage of these extremely low rates to refinance some debt with the result going to bottom line. Announced more debt reduction in coming quarters. This debt to buy Arriss is an anchor and impacts GAAP earnings and maneuverability. Glad to see this action."
This is definitely a good buy.
Rallied nice at end of new years Eve session. See if it can break higher after sideways since earnings. See if 15 by next option expiration.
"I just sold my ZAYO to move over here, I'm sure everyone here saw they announced the buyout at 35 ashr. What am I missing here? less outstanding shrs, twice the revs and 3 times the earnings. I've been buying all morning with expectations the analyst will be out in droves tomorrow just like they are for zayo today after earnings/buyout. If ZAYO is worth 35 then by the same calc comm is conservatively 50ish. I'm not saying there is a buyout in the works but you get the math. I expect buy recommendations and a 35 price target tomorrow unless they want to take positions before making noise, but the noise will be coming, anyone?"
"At least it hasn't been a conspicuous outlier on up days. Hopefully, 8/6 isn't a further setback."
The black sheep in my portfolio is moving.
"Under appreciated and unloved. INSG is another pure 5G play. It hadn't moved either, until they projected a huge increase in revenue a couple of weeks ago. COMM is a solid company that the market may someday start to love. Keep the faith!"
"Dali Wireless Dali Wireless to Appeal Recent PTAB Decision Regarding Its 9,531,473 Patent; Reinforces Commitment to Enforce Intellectual Property Rights"

"Up pre market on spin off. How does that make the stock worth more as a whole, spin off isn't till first qtr of 2022"
"Credit Suisse made this one of their top picks last week, and today, SILENCE."
"Worst case is this is a goose egg. I don't think so. More likely second worse case is that the company has to do a massively dilutive secondary offering with the stock in the single digits. For it to be big enough at those prices to have an impact on the debt, the sharecount will have to increase massively, possibly with warrants as well. At that point all the company's option plans will reprice to reflect the new levels; otherwise there's no way to hang on to senior management and key employees. Carlyle will also probably be issued warrants or some mechanism to prevent their dilution. Existing shareholders wont be wiped out completly, but should equity value even recover to prior levels years down the road, the stock price could still be about where it is now."
Shorts better start covering.
They had some interesting insights about COMM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Getting crushed pre-market; don't see an obviously related headline.
It looks like we have formed a new bottom......hopeful to build from here.
Forget about the boilerplate about growth and returns. This company is in survival mode.
Commscope 'received a favorable final decision from the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) against Dali Wireless'
New all-time intraday low. This has to have the record for those for 2019. Does anyone keep that stat?
What is the synergy on this buy of arrs?
This is a company at the beginning of a substantial 3-5 year secular growth trend! Yesterday’s hiccup is the same as is influencing thousand other companies in a multitude of industries! CommScope will be earning at a$2.60 rate within 12 months and will achieve a $3.00 rate at some point in 2023 and growth will still be accelerating. Additional c-band small cell auctions to occur next year on top of the $80 billion + that were consummated during the past few months. CommScope should sell at $25- $30 within the next 18-24 months and close to forty long before the cycle shows any indication of topping out!
Big Boys running it down more?? So they can Load up more? At a Cheap Price!!! Old Wall street Trick!!!
COMM just cut headcount today by many of their most seasoned sales staff. This cannot be good as most have been with the company 15-25 years.
"Nomura cut PT 29% to 17. Stock's down 50% ytd, so closing the barn door after horses left."
What is going on? Average price target on this is $28https://www.google.com/amp/s/techknowbits.com/2019/06/14/commscope-nasdaqcomm-upgraded-at-bidaskclub.html/amp
It will be interesting to see how they get CPE business and costs off the books. Tons of potential liabilities with long time employees/ severance obligations and a low margin business. Best solution would be a spin off or sale of underperforming business packaged with as much headcount as possible!
Outlook Stable!
"And below we go... more app to go lower before seeing $15. Hope I’m wrong but doubt it. I personally like the swings since they are funding my rainy day fund. The c-suite needs to go. The same people have been there to long. They are not a cable mfg anymore, and they have lost antenna mkt share. There are a lot players in the game now. Technology is changing so fast, why are carriers going to pay a premium for quality that will be replaced before the depreciation runs out."
"Thought these commscope dudes were gonna install equipment everywhere. 5g rollouts. Maybe this Covid19 #$%$ put the bag on them. Figure they can 5g everyone and track them, Covid19 or not. Track everything with 5g and beyond. Track weed sales, I hear they are up in the pandemic."
looks like a $8 stock at best... way over priced now...
5G is getting lots of attention and fits this company's core product set. This will be a strong performer over the next 3-6 years and the cellular upgrades typically run in 8-year cycles. We are at the bottom of the bell curve for 5G now. Nowhere but up from here for many years for the spend on 5G.
"I'm pretty comfortable calling the merger a disaster at this point. We should expect a significant write-down next quarter or two, which is hopefully being largely priced in - equity from one of the original companies has largely been eliminated already. What remains TBD is if the debt is more than the remaining business can sustain."
It is good to see the start of a management shake up. There is a real need to get a very decentralized ARRIS culture in line and rationalization of that organization -a lot of opportunity to save money. The supply chain needs to be revamped-the facilities foot print is far too big-it is easy to see. A lot can be done which will make Comm profitable. I will hold off on investing here until I see a detailed program on what Comm is going to do to restructure and the dollar impact.
Geez...Paid $ 7.4 billion for ARRS.....both now at $ 1.59 Billion Market Cap. ARRS people made out big time!
I figured NOK's beat would give COMM some momentum.
"Super high volume today. May be beginning to consolidate and reaching a bottom. “Dead cat bounce” likely coming tomorrow or later in the week. Too much negative news ( downgraded to $12), to even consider buying at these prices though IMO. CommScope has growth and debt issues."
The new organization structure is a great step. There also appears to be a significant effort to enhance the talent pool. A lot of work to do integrating and streamlining ARRIS. ARRIS financal leadership didn't seem to integrate acquisitions well. The CommScope financial team has a great opportunity to make this company a powerhouse.
When will they file for bankruptcy? Huge high interest debt load will revenue going down year over year...
Lots of negative comments here about management. At least the stock price is rising. I owned some ruckus a few years ago before they got bought. I don't know too much about commscope. Are they at least going in the right direction?? Stock is up since last year but far from where it was a few years ago.
"I just bought more shares, Im thinking Comm is near a Bottom so cost averaged down."
I think we are heading to $ 28 short term......
https://walletinvestor.com/stock-forecast/comm-stock-prediction
It seems like the share price to market cap ratio changed - it was that 10 was close to 2BB - now 10 is 2.1BB - have they issued shares?
NOK and ADTN don't bode too well for us; we'll see...
"Telcos in general and Commscop in particular, need to come up with another way to generate excitement than ""a bigger #G""."
Hard to believe a company that has billions in revenue and making $ is trading like this.....even if sales are down a little. The ARRS buyout and the cancel of annual guidance has really hurt......I think the latter most of all.
Theses earnings any good?
This is what I have been waiting for. for months.
There it is - new all time low.
i cannot believe COMM management won't issue a PR in between earnings to offer confidence.
Shorts covering before earnings locking in profits.
"We're approaching levels where every holder from any point since this became a public company has lost money - all time lows. Considering how the market and sector has done over the timeframe, it's pretty incredible."
Sales declines in every segment and geography.
I cannot believe the private equity group is allowing the price to tank like this......if they liked ARRS at $ 33 then they should love COMM at $ 16.00......unbelievable.
Interesting activity the last two days - especially in the early morning trading.
Harmonic(HLIT)https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HLIT?p=HLIT
why would anyone want to buy this company with aprojected 5 year growth rate of 2.5%?
"They keep deleting my post!Short and sweet: As a network engineer, I used to buy their stuff. They lost big data centers. We all started going with another brands switches. Ruckus is good but Aruba better. Comscope will struggle with growth"
"if your a buy and hold investor, COMM is on sale. Might be 12-24 months before your rewarded . Their supply chain, like most other companies, has been severely disrupted but reduction of debt ahead of schedule and more analysts are raising rating to ""buy"""
Two struggling irrelevant has-beens expand their relationship:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commscope-tivo-extend-expand-ip-120000840.html
high volume with positive price move looks promising .any news?
There must be news? Even this stock doesn't usually trade like this without.
huge number of August call options purchased. This is a #$%$ co. So something must be up.
"More layoffs coming this month prior to ER. Unlike past ones targeting over 50, this one is primarily IT. Good luck to those impacted. The place is screwed up. The only way it will get fixed is to clean out the c-suite from legal to finance or someone buy them but there is a reason they carry so much debt... to keep the suitors away."
"Gut the department. Layoff everyone to show reduced expenses, then palm it off to the gullible retail investor."
So I guess people aren't so impressed by the new CEO or the Ziply deal.
So nice to have feet back!
Some important EPS in morning will be the savings amount from buyout....this needs to impress!! I think since they retired the $ 100 M senior debt early and are announcement before bell are both bullish!!
new all time low
Not a bad day when compared to the DOW -603. Maybe the bleeding has stopped?
More good news
"Yeah it looks like NOK is doing some damage today in the equipment vendor area...But I also think it should mean that companies like COMM and CIEN may get put in play.I think further consolidation in the telecom vendor area needs to happen....and that is from the smaller vendors like WSTL, RFIL, WTT and PCTI all the way up through COMM, CIEN and the larger players...Just my opinion."
shares short increased 3.72 million last month.....on a low float stock that is what caused the decline....the good news....they will have to cover in due time.
thats an interesting bounce. Still only going down though
The 5G roll outs coming over the next few years provide a huge tail wind for this company. I do not believe they will languish here for long. Taking some proceeds from my IOTS winnings and buying first portions of what may become a larger position today. We'll just have to see how it goes.
Earnings Beat Next week should add from here.......I think we have made he turn!
"Matt, what’s your take on this continuous drop? Is it because of the Chanbond UOIP potential lawsuit, extreme debt, or all the above? The relentless selling doesn’t appear to stop."
Rough ending to week but can’t complain given recent run. Happy it still closed above 50 dma so we’ll see what next week brings.
"Don´t understand about the internal of company, every time stock propped the directors or ceo unloading."
Just picked up some shares....I was a seller in the $22 to $23's a couple of months ago...Maybe a bit overdone today.I was a buyer in the $16 to $18 plus range back in December but then sold out my position as noted above...Missed the run to $26...but like it here.
Four straight new all-time lows.
"Stock price will breach $10, heading to $9.50 unless drastic measures are taken to restore confidence. Unless of course the plan is to make the company cheap enough for Carlyle to take it private and repeat their 2.24x their investment like they did previously."
CIEN beat on rev. and gave upbeat guidance. They also bought back 1MM shares; that's off the table for COMM but it seems to have lifted the group.
"CommScope Holding Co. Inc. (NASDAQ: COMM) was reiterated as Neutral but its price target was raised to $12 from $7 (versus an $11.02 close, after an 8% gain) at Citigroup."
"up 39 cents or 3.65% today. Be patient and you'll be rewarded. With this company, long term performance is goal not satisfying shareholders on a quarterly basis. Comes from company being private two different times. Carlyle and Drendle might do it again."
so what is to expect...will the drop continue after open??
These dudes look underpriced. Thought these comm executives were going to try to raise stock price. Might be why they want more shares given to themselves
"CommScope caste system across the board and c-suite is piling on their own profits (LTIP) and shafting every other employee (below Sr Mgmt, who still enjoy the same perks). C-suite is there to squeeze some $$ out for Carlyle and dump the rest. Then they move on to kill the next business. Can't even get anything done anymore internally since they've laid off so many competent IT & other employees. Guess it just doesn't matter anymore."
just go inn. this seems to beat any expectation in q1 and q2. will see. but the biggest holders buy it around 10.30 from what i saw . :D
Didn’t even realize this came out…Credit Suisse downgrades CommScope Hldg Co from Outperform to Neutral and lowers the price target from $23 to $12.
Layoffs starting again today. They are nonstop. The new CIO is sending a lot of IT jobs to India.
COMM becoming a traders dream....Right in the sweet spot...buy 600 to 800 shares and you can flip them every couple of days for a buck or two.I love stocks that trade in the 9 to 13 range with some volume.
"Remember ""While the Company is not providing specific guidance for the third quarter, the Companyexpects its third quarter sales and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to improve modestly comparedto the second quarter. Additionally, the Company expects sales and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDAto sequentially improve in the fourth quarter. """
If the theory of buying low and sell high still works.....then a good time to buy.
Where did this volume come from??
Anyone here know what to make of those two big prints in Nov call options in the 15 and 16 strike? 5000 and 9000 volume over no open interest. Bullish or bearish??
"It's kind of ironic - I don't think I'm alone in missing the 5g roll out so far crushing one telco tech company after another, big and small."
I have owned for a year and the stock has gone nowhere. It’s a decent sized company and a pure 5G play. Their revenues are accelerating at a rapid pace. Keep the faith - the market will soon recognize this one.
"Might have to settle for 22 on earnings. Still think it hit 25, if not this month before year end."
"New skipper, same leaky boat."
"Finally into the 20s, next stop 23/24 last hit in 2019"
When there’s blood in the streets
Broke 22. On way to 25
Comm looks over sold.
"Green at last, green at last. Thank God Almighty it's green at last."

"Smart move realigning company into four business segments. First step in showing Wall Street potential value of company (if they sell off company in pieces), without having to commit to guidance. Buys another year for that. If anything should provide a floor to this stock.. Wouldn't be surprised to see a few upgrades in near future, with analysts trying to put a value on individual segments. Now of course the massive amount of debt on the other hand could pose a few issues, but Carlyle Group will help figure that out. GLTA"
"COO bought 4,000 shares Tuesday!!! A bullish sign"
Can management makes this business efficient and profitable so stock can move up?
"CommScope Holding Initiated at Overweight by JP MorganRatings actions from Benzinga: https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COMM/ratings (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 22, 2019 10:38 ET (14:38 GMT)"
Why in the heck would the CEA get 1.1 million in shares at $ 0.00 .....they are billions in debt.....poor timing at best.
"On an enterprise basis, this thing is significantly pricier than CIEN. Not sure it should be."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found http://tradenow.xyz. They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
weakness on a strong day appears to reflect 1. higher coupon on new debt. 2. disappointing rating on new debt deep in highly speculative junk range 3. lack of any significant progress paying down debt since the merger.
"Told you $12 was coming, why didn’t you listen and get out. Actually been telling you for sometime. Lol."
New all time low three days in a row.
"$27B cash at hand, Cisco is taking advantage of the current depressed valuations!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-csco-buy-fluidmesh-networks-013901672.html"
Goldman sachs put out a buy recommendation.
"If CSCO is floundering, what real shot does COMM have?"
I can’t believe they are paying out bonuses at 100% knowing ER sucked today. They are doing another layoff and is in process now. They need to layoff the c-suite for incompetence.
"Technical support at 13.20. If it passes through, it’s gonna end-up around $11; maybe lower. BOA bailed because of meager growth. Stock going from bad to worse."
We're going back to 13 
CommScope upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JPMorgan JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee upgraded CommScope to Overweight from Neutral with an $18 price target. The analyst likes the company's leverage to 5G network densification.
"Something doesn’t happen soon to fix whatever problems are causing this mess, then I wouldn’t be surprised if the company didn’t have a massive layoff in the near future"
Gonna play with a few shares through ER tomorrow.
"Cramer from ""Mad Money"" said he wouldn't own CommScope. Could it be that he knows that $UOIP/Chanbond will bury them?https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/cramers-lightning-round-ball-is-in-a-duopoly-it-is-a-total-windfall.html"
"In my opinion, at these prices every share sold is being bought by Carlyle Group. They already have option to convert $1B convertable debt to equity (16%) at 27.50. Not bad accumulating the rest at half price then taking iit private with huge payday shortly thereafter. Looks like great buying opportunity except no way of knowing how far down these guys will take it."
"COMM = -Growth but the CEO pay is hug. What do you think? Mr. Marvin S. Edwards Jr. Pres, CEO & Director Pay $1.83M Exercised =$4.1M"
CommScope is up 8.60% to 10.77
Anyone heard anymore on Comms going Private? I’ve heard it’s going to board meeting in couple of weeks time!
Xylnx also said 5G headwinds.....we are down in sympathy with slow 5G rollout.
"Arris had market cap of $5B, and SPECIFICALLY disclosed Chanbond case as contingent liability. CommScope had market cap in excess of $5B, but lost about $2B+, and DID NOT specifically disclose contingent liability. Inadequate disclosure of Chanbond liability in footnotes to financials. Market cap loss is significant since they purchased the Arris liability."
Market didn't like this deal when announced and on further review - seems to like it even less.
Double our Holds in COMM!!! Avg up a Little! But this & LUMN are our 5G plays. And Don't forget the COMM spin off next Year!!! GLTA!!!!
"I hear another exec is leaving. Who knows if voluntary or forced due to differences with Carlyle leadership but Cardwell is out the door now. The place is falling apart and as more and more people depart daily, it will soon be carved up like a Thanksgiving Turkey."
Sales of around $8B PA market Cap of around $2.5B ? Generating $0.8B positive cash flow! (Much of that most likely by squeezing inventory out of the Arris supply value stream?) A 5G Mega trend business.What am I missing?
Sell off looking over done. Back to Feb prices
New all-time low today
"Why the high trading plume today, accompanied by the jump in pps? Any news out there?"
"Yes, had someone contact me and let me know they released more staff. I said it was coming and another cut in by June is planned. I’ve also been saying for months they needed to unload Arris and hear they had a deal to sell and it fell through. The cost to carry 9.8b in debt is becoming to much. Treadway is cutting everything not nailed down. He needs to fire the c-suite since this is all on them."
"COMM is a symbol of utter failure. The company went public in 2013 at around $15 and after many ups and downs is now trading again at around $15. During this time COMM's only ""achievement"" has been an enormous weakening of its balance sheet while the CEO filled his pockets."
I think this company has a solid future but I don't believe they realized the work which had to be done pulling Arris in. General Instruments never integrated well with Motorola and they felt they were not part of Arris. The financial organization was very political and frankly poor.. Commscope has done a lot of good work sorting through these issues and as consolidation continues this stock is on my watch list.
upgraded!! bofa
