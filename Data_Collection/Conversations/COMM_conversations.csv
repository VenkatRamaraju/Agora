"Super high volume today. May be beginning to consolidate and reaching a bottom. “Dead cat bounce” likely coming tomorrow or later in the week. Too much negative news ( downgraded to $12), to even consider buying at these prices though IMO. CommScope has growth and debt issues."
Someone is gonna be on the hook for that open interest in the puts and calls. There's a bunch of puts. If stock stays here this are going to cost someone.

Litigation and Regulatory Risks We may incur costs and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others. We may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In the past, we have initiated litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party’s patent or other proprietary rights, and we may initiate similar litigation in the future. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the products or intellectual property that we have acquired through acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could be costly and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third-party technology. In addition, the payment of any damages or any necessary licensing fees or indemnification costs associated with a patent infringement claim could be material and could also materially adversely affect our operating results. Such litigation can also be a significant distraction to management. CommScope 10-Q 3/31/2019 http://ir.commscope.com/node/12811/html CommScope 10-Q 3/31/2018 http://ir.commscope.com/node/12021/html"
"Comm dudes must be going broke the way stock sold off. I thought we had insider buys. Looks like we're all bag holder and these guys go out of business with products in the ports or someplace. Downgrade city. Analyst dudes downgrade , looks like a disaster. Who care about debt it's sales and if no products to sell your punked"
Looks like we may have support at mid 11s. institutions have been buying. I'm buying more today.
"Told you $12 was coming, why didn’t you listen and get out. Actually been telling you for sometime. Lol."
They had some interesting insights about COMM on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"There's little reason to believe this company will ever do anything for shareholders. It's part of some companies' corporate culture, not others."
"No one wants this stock negative book value. I thought these commscope guys were earning money and paying down debt. Thought they were a 5 g play. Five times gravity, stock has no buyers."
"They keep deleting my post!Short and sweet: As a network engineer, I used to buy their stuff. They lost big data centers. We all started going with another brands switches. Ruckus is good but Aruba better. Comscope will struggle with growth"
"Doesn't make a ton of sense a stock trading at below a 10 pe ratio. Management said they wanted to raise share price. We will see. Didn't Claudius dude buy shares at over 15,??"
How to do clear $10BB in debt selling onesie-twosie $100 black boxes?
"Technical support at 13.20. If it passes through, it’s gonna end-up around $11; maybe lower. BOA bailed because of meager growth. Stock going from bad to worse."
Didn’t even realize this came out…Credit Suisse downgrades CommScope Hldg Co from Outperform to Neutral and lowers the price target from $23 to $12.
"Broke support at $13-ish. Next support around $11, half the June high."
Lol another debt rollover. They have a history of doing this more then the average company. Term must be coming up and they can’t pay it. Dead money here currently. Going back below $10 and then time to back up the truck.
Stock approaching a 52 week low. Nov earnings report must be unfavorable else those “in the know” would be buoying the 11-12 stock price and buying big time. In two weeks we will know.
"If it breaks support at 13.60-13.80, it’s headed lower. Very long term investment at this point and maybe too long. Maybe a short term trade if it drops to 12?"
"Here comes $12s and then $10 is not far behind. Lol. This company is a shell of its former self. When the correction hits due to realization of higher inflation, good luck bag holders."
"Thought these commscope dudes were gonna install equipment everywhere. 5g rollouts. Maybe this Covid19 #$%$ put the bag on them. Figure they can 5g everyone and track them, Covid19 or not. Track everything with 5g and beyond. Track weed sales, I hear they are up in the pandemic."
