"DT and DOCN are both great, solid disruptive growth companies. You will be rewarded holding for long-term."
Was hoping (I’m still hoping) DT would beat docn to 100.
"Great company, great fundamentals, great product, great short and long term potential. The next Trade Desk or CrowdStrike.... don't miss out while it is at a bargain price."
Holding the 50 DAY. Institutions are accumulating
"why is this tanking, report seemed solid"
"If you like DT, check out FROG. 12x 2022E revenue 35%ish revenue growth, FCF+ and ancillary software sector. Also a gold standard. Reason for stock down is a misunderstood Q2 Billings aberration. Full year revenue guide was increased. You’re welcome."
"This is a super star company whose stock is going to the mid-100's in 2021 based on growth and uniqueness of the companies platform. They will have Q - Report end of month and analyst are expecting it to exceed financial forecast. Get this while it dips, 69.88 is a dip to grab this stock."
This should merge with jfrog and get your figures in billions
This stock is amazing just straight up. What are they doing that others aren’t? These other companies like ayx just can’t go up consistently at all. DT seems to just go up everyday like a blue chip
A beast.
Thoma Bravo May start selling soon. Just a hunch
Wow ..
Dynatrace is down 6.02% to 73.02
why down ?
So.. I am thinking....... $85.00 - $90.00 by end of December. $100.00 by end of March 2023. Who's with me?
"Look at the valuation of DT and its FCF compared to all other SAAS stocks.DT has slightly lower growth, but so what, NET is 90x revs. Most are 50-60x revs, with no profits.If DT can just accelerate growth to 40%, this will explode."
This company is making all the right moves and the stock is destined for reflecting the companies positive momentum. This is not a bitcoin but a real product that provides a meaningful service that is unique and supports a broad range of needs at a high level. Purchase now while it is still in a reasonable financial play. Once it takes off it's not coming back down significantly.
A lot of options volume today. Especially on 11/19
Wall Street crooks back at it. We all know this price action makes no sense … down 9% seriously
"Global organisation that is in the beginning of its growth pattern and is adding new team members in high numbers to help scale the business. BY year end this stock will be over $150, don't miss out."
Dynatrace is up 4.91% to 73.47
"Dynamic company with incredible technology that is truly a game changer in todays IT industry. Clearly people are very familiar with DT based on the amount of trading but look forward to buying and trading based on the value of the company and not just looking and reacting simply to the stock. The company and what it brings is the story, not the candlesticks on a stock graph."
FYI in case you’re curious the plunge was due to now raising the high end of guidance and FX making growth look 2% worse than it actually was in constant currency. That is literally how stupid the market is. JP Morgan has a 25% revenue growth forecast for the next few years. Didn’t they hear this beat and raise monster say 30% annual growth for many years to come? This stock is gonna be $150-200 eventually. Who knows when. They should acquire FROG.
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than DT
Analyst upgrades across the board as expected. The same Monday morning quarterbacks with $45 price targets a year ago now have $85 price targets. What will they be in 12 more months?
C’mon…gotta get sticky with it! Stick it right here!
"Incredible article in Business Wire, Dynatrace rated highest in 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Customers Choice for Application Performance Monitoring. This is a dynamic company with significant runway, get in before it's too late and expensive."
"Worth $20BB, nooope for me"
Quality operator.
Good close over 70! Finally!
This stock is unstoppable. Watch it recover its losses by end of the week 
100$ stock
"Back on track as analysists reports come in, back to 80 by Dec"
DT the Teflon Don while tech melts down
"All the big players like apple, Microsoft, amazon, google are drastically down today. This is the time to step in and buy Dynatrace at a bargain price point. Don't miss out on this up and coming IT play. Truly a unique company that keeps getting better."
"Hope everyone had a chance to buy at lower price, I believe this has staying power."
"I am all in on DT, this stock has a real and dynamic product that is growing. Analyst are calling for a much higher price point and I think based on the consistent performance and potential for future growth makes this AI solution an incredible buy. If you want to look like a stock genius tell your family and friends about DT. Nothing is a guarantee but this is awfully close based on a company that is rock solid and making all the right moves. This is more than just an AI company which make this stock/company so valued. Good luck to all"
