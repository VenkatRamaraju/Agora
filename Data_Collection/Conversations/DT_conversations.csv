Earnings tomorrow? Pop or no
Does anybody anticipate that the presentation for the JP Morgan conference be beneficial to the share price tomorrow?
A beat
Breakout point over $40. 100dma sitting right at $40.11. Bullish MACD crossover. Looking real nice. My Near term target is $50. 1.618 fib extension takes it to $52.19. I’ll be conservative :)
The market leaders r toppy i submit the market can do nothing for months now as new leaders emerge and new names like $dmyi $vldr $dm $aone and several more who are new or already crashed to fair value meanwhile whole world is trapped in $aapl $nflx $googl $roku $tsla $now $dt $twlo etc and are wel known and topppppped out
"gonna run past $50 soon, get in and stay long"
Did they upgrade their Rev for this year to $900 M??That is a huge upgrade
Think I’ll jump in at 19.00
"Global organisation that is in the beginning of its growth pattern and is adding new team members in high numbers to help scale the business. BY year end this stock will be over $150, don't miss out."
Needham analyst Jack Andrews assigned a Buy rating to Dynatrace (DT) today and set a price target of $69.00.
Anyone wonder why Thoma Bravo hasn’t done a single secondary offering of DT in 2021 at these levels? Because they know they have a winner! Maybe they’re considering a sale
Going back and forth between Dynatrace and Marvell. Trying to figure out which one is going to be the next growth stock.
"buy on dips and hold for long term, nothing gonna happen, all will be sorted out. $DT buy for long term, great potential"
Just bought my shares again just to go through earnings like last time
wonderful earnings will repel the short sellers
$DDOG missed earnings. Expect some sell off here as well. Still have a superior valuation as a comparable to them. Although still overvalued imo. Expect some drop would be a good entry point.
how about adbe acquire DT
I'm keeping buying
No seriously why would I sell.
i think because too many shares in and it is hard to move the stocks up sharply....we have to attract more institutional investors to buy millions of shares to get it up there....next leg to 50 first and then we take off.....
"$DT earnings going to be huge with new big accounts win, shorts cant keep these companies undervalued forever, its gem in the IT space as everybody using and should use to identify failures and take action and their new security feature offerings out of the world solution $GME $AAL $AMC $SPCE $NOK"
"$DT given an amazing news guys, google cloud, relax and enjoy $GME $AAL $AMC $SPCE $NOK"
"if DATADOG is 50% higher then DT should be more than that. even good candidate for CISCO take over. They offered 7Bn for DATADOG, can go for Dynatrace which is better in all aspects."
"This is a never sell name. Unstoppable rule of 50 machine, with constant innovation. CEO speaks of $1M ARR with conviction. That’s 4x increase to revenue over time without adding a single new customer. Global 15,000 companies * 1M ARR = $15B of revenue = $150B market cap. Never sell. Competitors aren’t even close to this product quality."
This stock is amazing just straight up. What are they doing that others aren’t? These other companies like ayx just can’t go up consistently at all. DT seems to just go up everyday like a blue chip
Solid uptrend
"If they can put in another great ER with 35% growth and the same solid profitability path, this will go up!"
"Insiders trading or hedge funds - someone is pulling it down. Waiting to see who bailed out inspite of good earnings. Management needs to do a better job in communicating growth expectations and not be too conservative about it. Insiders/Executives need to step up and buy at this low price if they really feel good about this company and Thomas should stop considering selling any more secondary shares. DDOG valuation is so high(may be at the expense of DT), I am hoping after DDOG earnings, DT should catchup."
This is a puzzling drop. No new information other than the new share issuance several days ago. Assume stock settling after excellent earnings and will start to climb again. Anyone have different information?
"Call with the Investors today, Leadership was pretty upbeat. Hope DT gets the same multiples as DataDog someday...."
I use this software for my j o b. Its great. Helps out big time.
great run- but we might be out of gas for a bit
Solid hold here. New highs this summer
So why is this going down. Everything I read says they will beat estimates.
"6,5% down on very good news? This market is crazy..."
DT is down while its earnings are alltime high. what's wrong
"Tell me any metrics (Sales, GPM...etc) why DT stock valuation is lower than DDOG? DT should be in 80's now after DDOG earnings call yesterday and DDOG investors should be jumping ships to take advantage of DT's low valuation."
Hurray to us! You know who you are!
$60 next week
Next Splunk here imo...hold 2 years...
Report today is big!!
Hidden gem
Why is this up after hours? Any clues ?
this one will jump 10-15% in market green day
100 dollar stock all day!
D1 capital paid $41 recently for 5mm shares ...Good entry point
DT is strong as Gold.
DT CEO was just on Fox Business. Bright future in cloud computing management.
why down ?
What's up after hours?
new bullside rating from DA Davidson .. $34
"I watch these companies stocks. Elastic, Splunk, DT, DDOG, NEWR.DT was up $67.50 in pre-market. It opens and hangs around $65.00.I would like to know how? NewR can pop $5.00 bucks ($74.00) on a lousy 11% growth, another quarter of loss, which has been the case quarter after quarter.From what I can see DT and DDOG are eating them alive.DT should be $70+"
Go DT
must own stock in every portfolio.. high reward stock
Insider selling this make investor nervous
Salesforce or Adobe.. perfect candidate for Adobe imo
earning surprise again and again. DT is heading for new high.
"DY is done going through IPO base building, shaking out weak hands and having institutions buying the stock. Now supply will be restricted as holders will not sell stock easily and demand will be high. Time to enjoy the fruits of your sweat!!"
This nicely held support during the tech carnage Strong buy
"buy more guys, huge runup on the way 2021"
This is going to triple or more like ZS. Just watch :)
Perfect timing on the launch of their cloud security product.
"Ddog and DT same revenue and DT better margin than DDOG , but DT market capital 9.4 billions and Ddog 17 billions. I think DT still has a lot up Trent"
Quality operator.
will see 70's this month
Beautiful move last few weeks!
This company is making all the right moves and the stock is destined for reflecting the companies positive momentum. This is not a bitcoin but a real product that provides a meaningful service that is unique and supports a broad range of needs at a high level. Purchase now while it is still in a reasonable financial play. Once it takes off it's not coming back down significantly.
new highs tomorrow!!
The question is when will Thoma Bravo unload another blob of shares into the market. That overhang ain’t going away. Patience is a virtue
Premarket POP. Will it hold thru opening???
Lock up expiration Jan 28
Books look good. outlook upbeat. like this one LT
Almost scary how strong the shares are. Almost.
"Great company, great fundamentals, great product, great short and long term potential. The next Trade Desk or CrowdStrike.... don't miss out while it is at a bargain price."
you cant buy at this price after earnings.. just remember that
"Told ya yesterday morning that the upside for DT is on at full power..... I anticipate stock moving to mid-50s.35% growth in revenues in Q3 and projecting sequential revenue growth in Q4. With Google's earnings release and cloud business growth announced yesterday, Dynatrace is setup to be a huge beneficiary!!!"
7 to 8 percent gains the day before earnings is interesting.
Best company in the space.
"On the recent share offload by Thomas Bravo, they and the underwriters are making extreme profits at the cost of DynaTrace- nice arrangement between them and Dynatrace! Doubts comes in if the share price was rigged up in the last 2 months for both the offerings to offload...and they have more to come.""Dynatrace will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares being offered by the selling stockholders but will bear the costs associated with the sale of such shares, other than underwriting discounts and commissions""."
Why is it crashing?
Encouraged by the abundance of good initial analyst ratings so I started building a position today. Long term.
so quiet...
Anyone collecting this on dip ?
buying
Easy 20% gain from $50
This company has such an excellent business model and no competition I see at least 30% per year
The ER is Great and we are down $1.54 Pre-Market. WTHF?!?!?!
Long DT
When is lockup period for DT?
Why is it up so much :-)
DT About to jump to $45 quick!!!
New high today? Glad I held on
Good close over 70! Finally!
"It will be back up up and away in no time just like last time, nice buy opportunity"
"Dynamic company with incredible technology that is truly a game changer in todays IT industry. Clearly people are very familiar with DT based on the amount of trading but look forward to buying and trading based on the value of the company and not just looking and reacting simply to the stock. The company and what it brings is the story, not the candlesticks on a stock graph."
In again at $48 ish. Great company.
"wake up people, she is taking off."
"Good earnings, stable guidance and upgrades yet it falls! Anyone have a clue?"
Be careful thinking stocks like $DDOG $FSLY $DT $DOCU are value plays now that they have pulled back. These are momentum plays if the hot money rotates out it is a long way from any value guys finding them interesting. There is a probably a trade on an oversold bounce coming at some point just don’t get caught holding the bag in the end.
Load up
hold . do not sell
Feeling good about this today
Buy near $50
"I’m in this and RXT , look like sisters"
"This is a super star company whose stock is going to the mid-100's in 2021 based on growth and uniqueness of the companies platform. They will have Q - Report end of month and analyst are expecting it to exceed financial forecast. Get this while it dips, 69.88 is a dip to grab this stock."
C’mon…gotta get sticky with it! Stick it right here!
It will be in 100 before next year this time
add 100 shares today.
Could someone shed some light on the difference between DT and DDOG? DDOG stock price have gone up so much recently and it feels like DT has a lot of catching up to do. Is this truly due to product/price difference or the perception from Wall-Street Investors?
"What can incredible report all around. Rule of 60 company that will hit $1B ARR this year! Company is trading at a low teens revenue multiple of ARR which is absurd. This is a buy don’t trade stock for sure. I will be buying every day and down to the 30’s if this bs inflation scare continues (FYI the only categories experiencing inflation are hotels, airlines, used vehicles and sporting event tickets)...hmm I guess an airline ticket can’t cost $25 forever?"
Tech is about to hit correction . Limit your loss and wait for bottom . I think DT May revisit 23 to 25 range . It is nothing wrong with DT just tech correction
Not an overly loved company yet. Buy it while you can
"Growth is getting smoked.We have seen this before, chances are 6 months growth will be crushing again because all ER has been great, and the tech trends in the world aren't changing."
"Incredible article in Business Wire, Dynatrace rated highest in 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Customers Choice for Application Performance Monitoring. This is a dynamic company with significant runway, get in before it's too late and expensive."
With online business and transaction sky rocketing this puppy is going to fly big time. And if you take into consideration their business model where they charge per transaction ... oh boy :-) GLTA !!!
Balance sheet of this company is beautiful...growth of over 20 percent consistently qtr over qtr and worldwide presence. This will be 100 dollar stock within 1-2 years.
Has run room ahead!
Expected to beat earnings?
Service Now can be a strong potential acquirer. It is well integrated with Dynatrace already and aligns well for both the companies for future growth. Lets see...
Finally.
wish i had bought more.
I sold Datadog and Cloudflare too soon and watched both take off. Im not going to do the same with this baby. Good luck to all longs.
$60+ after earnings
"DT growth is spectacular, the major resistance to stock performance is the high level of debt currently around $480M. Their cash is only around $250M."
This stock has a bright future. GLTA
General market slightly down but this is taken down way too much in pre-market trades. Manipulation as usual.
Up on nice volume is a good sign.
DT the Teflon Don while tech melts down
UBS had this on their top picks in the technology sector for 2021.
"Hope folks realize this is a non-dillutive offering, just like someone selling a bunch of shares they already own."
"DT long term buy, gem in cloud arena"
"Bottom line, slow and steady wins the race, if they hit $100 by EOY I am extremely happy. I honestly don't see how this could experience a pull back today, hope it doesn't happen. I do see additional upgrades and price targets coming next week for the stock."
Why is it falling? Down much more than Nasdaq and DDOG.
Very good company
Who's here because of Tom Nash?
Needham start covering with $36 price target. GLTA !!! https://m.benzinga.com/article/15979854?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+benzinga+%28Benzinga+News+Feed%29
Love this company. Buy hold forever or till they’re acquired :). I predict this doubles in a year
Was hoping (I’m still hoping) DT would beat docn to 100.
DT is up 9.31% to 31.35
A beast.
DT is as stable as US bond.
anyone else expecting buyout offer anytime soon? dynatrace is the mandatory app to use in all IT projects
"this was getting very good traction before Covid19, with IT departments and companies adopting Dynatrace as their primary cloud infrastructure and performance monitoring tool, with everyone and everything moving to online this is going to fly"
the hedgefund shortsells as DT is to ride over 50.
Key Turning PointsDAILY52-WEEK2nd Resistance Point29.311st Resistance Point28.40Last Price27.481st Support Level26.912nd Support Level26.33
blind buy..
Anyone think MSFT might have an interest in DT?
Will this bounce back?
Trending back up needs to cross 21.80
Every time they announce good news we go down. Weird
"Got 3,680 shares from 27.50 - 28.32, super happy with the investment so far"
Buying the dips after ER
Hopefully with today earnings DT becomes the darling of investors Vs DDOG and gets the place it deserve!! Waiting to hear more on the conference call..
on sale $dt too
Buying every $1 down. Inflation scare is huge opportunity. Will be$1B ARR in 2021 and rule of 60 at 13x 2021 ARR!! Cheap!!!!!
Any idea why investors are pulling out?? It’s supposed to be other way.
"All the big players like apple, Microsoft, amazon, google are drastically down today. This is the time to step in and buy Dynatrace at a bargain price point. Don't miss out on this up and coming IT play. Truly a unique company that keeps getting better."
what is the deal today?
Nice!
25.16 but you may want to wait
Dynatrace reached an all time high at 37.83
"DT just keeps moving up, they have a great team... and a great product."
Bought more DT today!!!
"dynatrace and splunk both used heavily in all IT companies to analyse cloud data and logs.. hold long, dont think about selling at all.. add in every dip"
"$ark should start buy this company, almost all the companies need dynatrace for effective cloud management"
"Glad I bought the dip.This is a high quality company, we just need it to grow at 30+% and we will hit a nice win.I think 30+ is very reasonable."
What an awesome candle today. Can we say strenght ? Longterm winner imho
way to go DT
why it's going down?
Why huge volume? 10x!!!
Just as i sold yesterday after holding for 3 months..
Analyst reactions will likely be fully positive - should at least keep things around the $50 mark for the time being.
"Thomas Bravo bought another tech company today, Medalia. How long before the bidding war starts for this gem?"
Price to sales in the 20s and a forward PE in the 70s. I’ll pass 
should be above $60
DT reached an all time high at 29.96
"great buy at this price.. keep add this gem, never ever sell this. just hold forever"
"This stock is hard to figure out. Goes down for no reason, no news. Great financials. Don’t know why anyone would sell."
"Bubble, what bubble?The bubble people don't know where to look for cheap growth.$46 is too low for this stock and I had to buy it.Hopefully it's growth accelerates a little too, making this a great pick for the ever expanding complex cloud."
What is the target price on this 3 to 6 months out?
DT is conservative about guide . They always guide low than actually is . 19 to 20% growth too low for growth stock . I don’t claim them at all because nobody know in this coronavirus time
price target 100 dollar bullish
"Expect a great day for tech stocks and Dynatrace, particularly all associated in and around eCommerce. Amazon is projected to report a $100B quarter which is a huge catalyst for DT. Alibaba already up 10% and then announced an earnings beat this morning. Google is expected to have a blockbuster earning quarter when they announce results after market today. This should drive a huge upside for DT to go back and touch the new highs near 50.... Already ticking up!! Going to moon today, longs!"
"Investor conference tomorrow, I expect to see over $70 by mid to end of next week."
"One of my favorite names, will never sell. Just want to remind everyone that Thoma Bravo still owns 30% of the company, and will likely continue to unload these shares in multiple follow-on offerings throughout 2021. For the fundamental, patient investor, this will represent an opportunity to buy as levels may dip as free float increases. I have a 10 year target of $300 based on 550 customer adds per year, 10x revenue, reaching the promised and of $1M ARR and some share dilution to 300 FDSO. That's an IRR of about 20% over 10 years. Enjoy!"
Grab shares at $41
Solid buy
4 qtrs in row BEAT earnings expectations Beast mode
"Look at the valuation of DT and its FCF compared to all other SAAS stocks.DT has slightly lower growth, but so what, NET is 90x revs. Most are 50-60x revs, with no profits.If DT can just accelerate growth to 40%, this will explode."
Great buy at $49
Zero insider holdings
See Y'all at $60
next stop $60
Great results! Hope someone on the earning call ask about how they did on Revenues and new Customers for Infrastructure monitoring and the new Security product they added recently.
above 50
Epic.
"OK market. Non-event by the fed . Move on, and get back to business -"
heading to new high now
"Buy opportunity, just like DDOG with great earnings!"
"Citi analyst Tyler Radke made the case for the observability stocks in a research note on Thursday.He also repeats his Buy rating on Dynatrace (DT), taking his target up to $83, from $67;"
"Great top and bottom line earnings report. Growth in ARR, reduced debt, good leadership and there is no pop. When compare with the competitors this is a gold mine. Why is it only 20x its revenue. When others are being valued at 40x? Can someone explain this to me please."
Great rebound coming. Nothing short of a top notch company who delivers on there magnificent products
"great product, but the stock has a mind of its own, no relation to market ..waiting for earnings to decide whether to get in..anyone here knows better? thanks!"
Great earnings!
"If you like DT, check out FROG. 12x 2022E revenue 35%ish revenue growth, FCF+ and ancillary software sector. Also a gold standard. Reason for stock down is a misunderstood Q2 Billings aberration. Full year revenue guide was increased. You’re welcome."
"Solid numbers. Not a flashy stock, but they make great $$ and if they can hit the 35% growth they are very undervalued with a much lower valuation compared to other SAAS stocks."
SAAS stocks are on a tear.DT is still has the best valuation if they can hit 30+% growth.
Dynatrace is up 7.39% to 47.50
"did someone see a deal with tiktok, and then it got removed the press release?"
"Reading the CC notes, it’s easy to see that this is an amazing company. The confidence just exuding from the CEO that they have a commanding presence in their space and products that are unrivaled. Analysts seemed pretty impressed, as well. Thrilled to be on board this ride."
Setting up beautifully going into earnings. Couldn’t ask for more.
Can someone please explain why the pullback after yet another great earnings report? I just don’t get it.
What are your guys thoughts on earnings call this week? Do we see an outbreak?!
"I’ve read and listened to every word of every transcript since this company was public. Reminds me of ZS when ZS was called expensive at $35 (now $220). Even if the multiple gets ahead of itself, never sell DT. This is a forever stock."
"I don't get drop after DPS also. Looking at 2 charting services, one has the 200 day move ave a little over $ 35, the other a little over $ 37. So Stock should try to hold here, which is my guess. If selling not over, could dip to $ 30. but either way, I expect it to start a steady move to over $ 40 in the near term. Currently, DT is my biggest holding, watch it closely.Steve E"
We reached the bottom at 50...from now on only up. This is the way.
I expect a 20% increase after this selloff
This was an easy buy on that hard dip.This is a quality company.
Was about time.
"The company, however, reversed to a loss of $116.19 million in 2019 from a profit of $9.2 million in 2018, as operating expenses ballooned."
excellent er! bravo
Grab some shares under $50
Another data gem
"ZS with good numbers. When DT gets it’s security product refined, look out. Going to make some serious money here."
Who will buy at 34.50? When current price is less than 34.
"45 is a decent entry point for this. not spectacular , that would be more like $40 - but for a longer term investor 45 is ok. hopefully earnings will be blowout and raise the floor. the cap to revenue is a lot better than stuff like CRWD etc. so this should be a little more resilient than some of the saas offerings."
New ATH Sky’s the limit
Hallejuah.... There you go... and we are on our way to the moon!! Huge upside expected!
will reach all time high in few weeks
"I like the nice slow moves, keeps us off the radar for now"
Got lumped in with overpriced high flying cloud names
Buy buy buy!
Looks like $70 is coming
DT going to new high!!
A lot of options volume today. Especially on 11/19
"Debt, That being said, I’m staying long .good long term hold..."
DT going to $50 quick!!!
How much is the market cap on this?
Added 140 stock
100$ stock
