"Here's the problem in the markets....You have GME ( Gamestop) that is/was borderline bk and trading at $180+ with virtually zero hope for future growth and then you have NUE...Growing and looking at a 2 year growth period, beats top and bottom line, projects record earnings and if infrastructure passes this next couple weeks you a a 10 year payday! Down 4%+ today......just isn't right..."
Breakout starts today
"Side by side comparison of CLF and NUE. 3Q dataCLF 6B rev and 1.3 B profitNUE 10.2 B rev and 2.1 B profitCLF 11 B market capNUE 30 B market capUsing NUE as a market cap predictor, CLF’s market cap should go to 18 B as smoke clears. Equates to a ~ $33 SP."
$NUE $CLF X is just getting started. It has 22.5% short interest and it just cleared one bar by monster beat. Literally 6.9$ just for rhe quarter. Better vehicle for infrastructure bill is $X
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"NUE $7.28 is below their own forecast of $7.30-.40. However does it really matter when $7.28 is up from $.63 cents a year ago and the record $5.04 in the second Q. The good news is this is NOT the peak Q. The 4th Q will be yet another record. Even early next year earnings comparisons will be very good as demand is staying stronger than some analysts expect. I expect NUE might have an early selloff like STLD did, the rally on the conference call and 4thQ and 2022 outlook. NUE's scrap costs were way up. CLF costs will not be so I expect them to outperform in the near term. PlusCLF has more exposure to Auto which is expected to stay strong longer."
"From Cramer’s afternoon news letter:Nucor (NUE) reported third quarter earnings before the opening bell Thursday. Net sales of $10.31 billion (+17% QoQ) was roughly in line with estimates, however record earnings per share of $7.28 (up from $5.04 in 2Q21) came in below management’s preannouncement range of $7.30 to $7.40. It’s a surprise to see a company pre-announce to the upside and then report a number slightly short of their range. After reaching out to management to help understand the disconnect, what they pointed out was that the intercompany profit eliminations from the downstream business were more than expected, resulting in a non-cash miss. Nucordidn’t miss guidance because of shipments. It was simply a function of their vertical integration. This miss on earnings explains why shares were down hard in today’s session. Instead of focusing on a difference of a few pennies per share, we think investors should turn their attention to operating cash flow numbers because that’s a better tell of the story. It's a cash flow story:Here, Nucor delivered its strongest performance in company history, with operating cash flow of $3.62 billion crushing estimates of around $2 billion. On top of record levels of cash flow, Nucor also continues to repurchase stock at a steady pace. The company bought back approximately 8.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $104.60, compared to 6.8 million shares at an average price of $90.80 in the second quarter. As of October 2nd, the company had $1.9 billion remaining under its newly authorized program. But not all of the company’s cash flow is returning to shareholders. Over the past few months, Nucor has announced and completed several acquisitions aimed at increasing capability and share in fast-growing markets. Nucor also recently announced plans to build a new $2.7 billion state-of-the-art steel mill. As for the fourth quarter, Nucor said they expect net earnings will ""potentially"" exceed the record set in the third quarter. Current fourth-quarter earnings estimates per FactSet call for flat earnings quarter to quarter, so we think management’s commentary leans neutral to positive relative to expectations. Nucor also said it expects demand to remain “robust” across most end-use markets well into 2022. With demand expected to stay strong for the foreseeable future, new supply and its impact on prices will be the main thing to monitor. By segment, Nucor expects the profitability of the steel miss and steel products segment to increase compared to the third quarter. What will drag earnings on a sequential basis is the raw materials segment, where earnings are expected to decline primarily due to margin compression at their direct reduced iron facilities.Buy on weakness: We would be buyers of Nucor after this weakness for a few reasons: • First off, we continue to believe steel prices will be far more resilient than what the market is expecting thanks to auto manufacturing bouncing back and new investments in oil and renewable energy. Additionally, the company has pointed out that customer inventories are still “relatively lean” and the order backlog at most of the businesses means strength should continue next year. • Second, watch what management is doing. The company continues to repurchase stock, sometimes even at higher levels, and we take that for confidence in the future. • Lastly, we remain hopeful that an infrastructure bill will be passed. It’s going to take a lot of steel to complete the projects Congress • plans on funding, representing one more positive demand driver for 2022 and in future years. Nucor is a terrific choice for investors who are looking for a stock to buy if and when an infrastructure bill is ready to be passed."
"Everyone knows Nucor is going to have a great quarter, IMO what will drive the stock is the forward guidance."
added more this morning at 100.30. Great earnings. Market over reacted as usual.
"Congratulations from us longs on the CLF board. Hope we all go much, much higher."
Infrastructure Bill will pass soon ans send this stock to 125.00+ PPS
$CLF or $NUE Buyout coming ? I mean it makes sense as $X got so much cash they can probably buy themselves out.
"I guess it’s good the company is buying back shares at a discount, if it goes below 100 I may have to sell something and buy more NUE cause in a year this will be a lot higher!!!!!!!!!"
"STLD and $NUE with PE 6 and double digit growth, look undervalued. With the coming infrastructure spending, it is no brainer for long holding."
"I guess the forward PE is below 4 now. With share buybacks and eventual infrastructure work, seems awfully cheap."
"Anyone who was on the fence this is a great buying opportunity,if I was not fully invested I would be buying!!!!!"
"Record earnings tomorrow. This along with the forthcoming infrastructure bill should put 2021 earnings north of $20. Plug in a 10x multiple, which is due a best in class company, gives you a $200 share price. It may take a few months but I believe it gets close. $110 after earnings $120 after the bill passes. IMHO GLTA"
First time closing above 50 day MA in 5 weeks...very bullish. MACD and RSI still have plenty of room to the upside. Infrastructure passage puts NUE back above $125.
What are NUE's free cash flow commitments in the coming year? The new plant? What else?
"There is not one thing in this ER to promote someone to sell this right now, especially before the CC. I do not understand this market."
