Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
Buy now pay later.
"MA IS GOING DOWN rather strongly not just a few weeks - but starting from April-May. On the bullish side:- spending is all-time-high: projected revenue for the quarter are $5B versus $3.9B year ago, almost30%- projected earnings are also all-time-high- almost all on WallStreet are bullish, with target price $85 above current price.***I do not understand it. Visa V, which always was underperforming MA and has WORSE fundamentals, behave much better now: last 3 mo it's up 2% while MA is down 2%.***I cannot explain this, but I'm NOT SELLING my call spreads - just rolling them further, even bought a few more recently. Maybe some mighty groups manipulating stock? - ""conspiracy theory""? :-)Good Luck to everybody - Emanuil"
how will this stock compare to visa down the road now that it's banned from issuing new cards in India?
Goldman Sachs says MA is one of 9 most popular stocks among hedge funds along with V!!! Long term will be amazing!!
Up one and a half percent for the year; Whoopie Doo!
good opportunity to buy long forever
Another day market grinds higher while MA flat lines or goes down. Morningstar 331 fair market value price target looks about right.
"MA has hit oversold territory at current trading levels, and is in prime position for a rebound on bargain hunting!"
AMZN and AFRM announced a deal that has AFRM up $30 in the PM. Buy now pay later is becoming a bigger trend. Not good for legacy CC companies. (I own a little MA).
"Understanding that Delta is causing concern over a rebound in travel I find MA @ $350ish to be inexplicable. Is the market also concerned about consumer spending given the coming end to unemployment bennies? The analyst's numbers haven't budged. Could this also be about the ""buy now pay later"" trend that was in the spotlight after SQ's acquisition? MA at this price doesn't make sense to me."
"From reading the comments posted on this message board, I realize there are many newbie investors with little experience in equity markets. Regardless of what you post on this message board, it has no effect on the share price. 95% of the volume on big cap stocks such as Mastercard is from institutions. And they do NOT visit message boards to base their trades on. I've been a share holder of MA and V since their respective IPO's.Both are growth stocks, with earnings & profits increasing year after year.Hold on to your shares, you will be rewarded."
Going to be a slow and long recovery for payment stocks for sure! Until travel picks up and Covid kind of fades it’ll be very volatile or downward action.
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
The recent results of bricks-and-mortars have seen substantial growth. I hope this helps MasterCard to generate more revenue.
"Looking forward to Investor Day. Rekor would not have scheduled a meeting with analysts if they did not have important things to say. As we know, lots of positive things happening at Rekor. Some easily understood: REKR is working with ALL bidders on the US border. Clearly they will unpack the Waycare acquisition strategy. Challenge is some work is behind nondisclosure agreements with companies such as $TSLA and $MA . I assume the work with $VRRM is also behind a NDA, just dont recall hearing Rekor say that."
Looks like weakness on the 10B to 15B class action suit against MA in the UK. Another money grab by foreign country milking US corporations. Mastercard sets interchange fees and the UK is arguing they were too high. Really? Nobody is forcing consumers or merchants to use them. They obviously found enough value in using MA and now they wanna complain they don't want to pay for it and want their money back. Total insanity. If I were MA I would say you toss this out or we will cut off card usage in the UK. One less competitor should help their claimed problem.
Look at the 6 month and 5 year charts. I'm not worried about MA. This isnt a stock to day trade. This is long term.
MA trading in oversold territory and presents a nice opportunity for MA longs with the ability and conviction to add at these bargain levels!
"Love seeing green. There’s only a few reasons for this stock to drop particularly when the inoculation pace has been good, normalization of societies plausible occur in a couple of months and on top of all these, tourism and hospitality sectors have seen apparent revenants in some parts of Europe and Asia."
