"I don't know how many Cramer fans are out there but for what it's worth I subscribe to his stock advice service. He just initiated a position (last week and today) with an average cost of $367, the target being $425. He thinks concerns over the SQ acquisition are overblown, attributing the some of the recent weakness to Delta concerns."
Bets on a Negative close? Jim Cramer says sell on Mad Money
"Been a long time holder of $MAIt’s been a tough yr or 2 especially when bitcoin is up over 400% for the year & dogecoin up 10,000% for the year. Somethings Not Right"
I’m curious to know who is selling MA and why? What’s the reasons for the downtrend since earnings? Thanks.
401 to 337.... wth
No confidence. As soon as we bounce up a few $ it’s sold off. $400 is not in the foreseeable future.
"What has really been in the news as one of the most profitable investments in the world, I really don't understand much about it"
"Looking forward to Investor Day. Rekor would not have scheduled a meeting with analysts if they did not have important things to say. As we know, lots of positive things happening at Rekor. Some easily understood: REKR is working with ALL bidders on the US border. Clearly they will unpack the Waycare acquisition strategy. Challenge is some work is behind nondisclosure agreements with companies such as $TSLA and $MA . I assume the work with $VRRM is also behind a NDA, just dont recall hearing Rekor say that."
"Love seeing green. There’s only a few reasons for this stock to drop particularly when the inoculation pace has been good, normalization of societies plausible occur in a couple of months and on top of all these, tourism and hospitality sectors have seen apparent revenants in some parts of Europe and Asia."
"If this downturn were from the virus, then why is PayPal and SQ up?"
Criminal trading going on right now.
Just about holding steady with bad news of retail sales
"What a great day. Have a greater weekend, long holders."
"Alrighty, MA held water. Cheers, fellow shareholders."
Why 5% down aftermarket?
Just sold this and Visa. Appears PYPL and SQ are starting to eat them up. Been a nice run but time to put the money to better use.
Good time to buy
Awesome it seems MA starts to get some traction
Another month like today and I'll break even. Excited!
I spend about $50K a year on a credit card. I use AMEX exclusively because they give me cash back. My Mastercard is useless.
Today’s temporary oversold conditions in MA and V is a “gift horse  buying opportunity” for cognoscenti investors — who understand that the these “fog of confusion” that generates mass behavior contagion f.e.a.r moments can be great wealth creating times for investors with a “selective contrarian investing bent” to make the most of these opportunities!
Are we going to $320s?
Jim Cramer bought more Mastercard today
And down she went...
This should have a lower multiple now. Still rich at 48 times
Up one and a half percent for the year; Whoopie Doo!
"The Amazon deal is so big for Affirm... Actually $AMZN will benefit tremendously too. Their ecommerce margins are so slim, now with the opportunity of earning a slice of the payment fees, even a tiny sliver, will unlock a new revenue stream for Amazon. Affirm is a direct payment gateway interacting with the consumer and the merchant all under one roof, which makes their business model so attractive. Think about how many layers take place in credit card transactions today. Consumer's checking account pays the credit card issuer, and on the merchant side there are so many intermediaries that pass through funds between $V and $MA and till they arrive to the merchant. $AFRM, even though they utilize existing banks and credit cards as form of payments, is a truly end-to-end experience, and as they grow they can educate consumers to lean towards using their own branded cards, such as the Affirm Debit+ expected to be released next week."
Down 2% on above average volume. I wish I understood why so I could make a decision about what to do.
"For the long term, there's still a lot more this can go. At $39B it can easily be scooped up by a $V Visa which has a $500B market cap, or $MA with a $330B market cap, or $PYPL $JPM $BAC $AXP. Affirm is disrupting the space, and adding so much value. Consumer spending are reaching records - look at bank earnings this AM, and Ecommerce continues to accelerate, making this a no brainer for the long run."
"I've been long MA for many years, and do not plan on selling for many more. That being said, if we ever hit $300 again, I am loading up on more."
This stock is in the dog house. What’s going on and what will it take to get out of this bad mess?
Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
"I’m very confident this will go back to $400. Not because I’m pumping but because the numbers and subsequent situation as an entirity looking healthy.For swing traders - don’t swing trade this one, this is not a quick buck machine."
back to 52weeks high in no time $MA
This stock stays in correction territory like no other
Remember last month when you wished you had taken advantage of the big dip then missed 390s?
This is a long term forever stock!! You never sell it!! It’ll go up year over year. Just a down time but will come back stronger than ever. 100% no doubt. Should have a solid few months remaining with holidays approaching. May the longs be with you!!
"It has broken well above the 50 dma, because, of course it has since I sold 10% of my position yesterday."
"MA like many growth stocks keeps testing its recent lows. Buying the dip isn’t working. Inflation is raging, today’s CPI report of 5.5% increase is at a decade high. For those in denial rising rates are not good for growth stocks especially in a grossly overvalued stock market. If the Fed is forced to raise rates another leg or two down. If the Fed doesn’t do it the bond market will."
The Costco’s and Home Depot’s always busy in good and bad times and people use their credit cards as payment!
Added more at $339. Nice to add $60 off it's high.
"With a little luck, we could get to $400 by the next presidential election."
MA continues to form a solid basing pattern at this bargain level!*** We can expect a breakout bounce to the upside on very strong sexy legs soon!!!
Totally rigged look at gdf daily chart
surprised the stock's not plowing in with the bad job numbers just coming out
MA has work to do. Volunteered at a telethon last week and took about 75 phone calls. Of all the people that donated to the people I was raising money for 95% used Visa cards.
"With a little luck, we may see $400 by 02/22."
353 in pre-market 15 min later down 7... #$%$ BS
Massive massive massive insider selling. Have to wonder what they know that the public is unaware of.
Giving all the other day's gains back. PYPL getting killed too. Why?
Why Mastercard up 2$ while Visa is down?
The success behind my income making and earning in btc investment does not hang on my skills but the of an expert his Facebook handle is Williams E Morgan
I just bought more.
"People used credit cards to invest into China Evergrande financial, now it default close to 300 billions...."
how will this stock compare to visa down the road now that it's banned from issuing new cards in India?
"""On the margins, there's definitely an opportunity for buy now, pay later to take market share of credit cards,"" he said. ""But it would take a pretty big increase in the size of the buy now, pay later loan originations to make a material impact to credit card originations."""

All the big brokers are saying MA up and yet we’re falling pretty steadily. Who is doing all the selling?
V getting hammered too. What gives?
CNBC just #$%$ on MA.
"With a forecast to 437, should we buy more now or wait till it goes to 290, which is the lowest after covid start."
MA will have a stellar week ahead! Great tome to buy buy buy!! May the longs be with you!! Hoping for $375-380 by weeks end!!
Looks like the market has decided to start it's correction and MA is already down 15%. Somebody already knows what the Fed's are going to do next.
Jeez this thing looks like the most shorted stock of the month lol.
Not very happy with MA stock at the moment. You have to be realistic and the world has changed and I’m scared it will be a long way back to normal like 3-5 years. Maybe never? That would be crazy maybe but the current economic situation is not good for MA. I hold nu tomorrow I will buy Amazon stock and not MA.
"Economy, delta, competition in the payment space. The easy ride MA and V have had may be over."
Very nice rebound off oversold conditions earlier today!*** The journey back to $400 begins with an almost imperceptible first step…
@ Big Thinker???:You are conflating disparate and separate business models into one Giant and confusing mess that nobody can comprehend because of an illogical sequence!
Another day market grinds higher while MA flat lines or goes down. Morningstar 331 fair market value price target looks about right.
today is a buy buy buy buy.
Let’s go MA. ComeOn. May the longs be with you!!
Are we actually being disrupted by buy now pay later or square type fintech or is the price drop consumer confidence related?
Market roaring ahead today but as usual MA getting left behind. Reflects MA is not a true hyper growth stock nor a cyclical stock begetting from inflation embedded in economy. Add in nosebleed valuation and lucky for MA to tread water here.
Going green shortly
lot of money to grab here short term $MA
V and MA - one of the best opportunities in the market !!
"Bottom hit already on Friday, will go slowly up until earnings"
"Such a wonderful day. Cheer, fellow investors."
back to 52w high
"Could be wrong but down 10% in a month with no news, a month or so before all the bid spending holidays sounds like a buying opportunity here. I’m in and will average down if needed. GLTA"
Great close!
Inflation are rumors. They have enough money until December. Shorts are trolling their short positions. Bots are spamming for hedge funds $V
As long as the cross boarders openings are limited $ma and $v stocks move would be very limited as well Even if they posted amazing earning reports
"Mastercard Rolls Out 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Installment Option in US, UK, Australia11:03 AM ET, 09/28/2021 - MT Newswires11:03 AM EDT, 09/28/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Mastercard said Tuesday it has rolled out a ""buy now, pay later"" program for customers the US, Australia, and the UK in a push to meet growing consumer demand for more payment options.The new BNPL program, called Mastercard Installments, allows customers to pay for their online and in-store purchases through equally sized, interest-free installments using the Mastercard global network.""People want more from their money with greater flexibility and control in how they pay and where they shop,"" Craig Vosburg, Mastercard's chief product officer, said in a statement. ""Mastercard Installments has been built on our guiding principles to protect consumers and enable choice without sacrificing trust and security."""
Buy now pay later.
20% undervalued.
Breakout begins folks...BNPL diversion was a joke to say the least
Feels like I've taken a ride in a DeLorean at 88mph back to March 2020
"While there isn't any major news today, it's worth noting that there has been some concerning data to emerge about the BNPL space as a whole. One study released last week found that one-third of U.S. consumers who used a BNPL service had fallen behind on at least one payment. A separate study found that about 10% of BNPL consumers in the U.K. were facing collection activity.To be clear, BNPL continues to be a red-hot growth industry for now and there's nothing in Affirm's latest earnings results to indicate that any consumer activity is a problem for the business. But these trends are certainly worth monitoring as the industry grows."
Let's hope for good earnings
Morningstar moved MA to a hold from a buy last week. That is likely a big reason for at least some of the drop.
1 hour to go for green
$MA
Stay Long and Prosper
I heard about MA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Boom! What a day!! May the longs be with you! Buy buy buy!!
"The stock is in freefall. If this is travel related I'm cool with it. It's a buy. If not, if there is a fundamental threat to the biz model, that's another matter. I've used all my resources to get an answer to which one it is and can't find a thing."

MA trading in oversold territory and presents a nice opportunity for MA longs with the ability and conviction to add at these bargain levels!
"MA and VISA are likely to go down by 35% as Russia, India and other other countries are trying to establish their own payment system to safeguard thier financial security and interest."
Down $6.25 AH....anyone know why?
-2.68% YTD at the moment. We might see an uptrend when the post-pandemic era really starts.Can’t help but to wait til next summer. I’m long.
You always have to buy MA when it dips this much. Its always been a great buy!
Is it fair to see $MA $800 share in five years?
To the moon! Where you at Reddit ? Lol
MA has been left in the dust this year
Dead board when we drop. Where are all the pumpers?
complete and utter b.s. today on 10.4.
Look at the 6 month and 5 year charts. I'm not worried about MA. This isnt a stock to day trade. This is long term.
Where are we headed?
"The market is up about 13% for the year, Square (SQ) is up 9% this year, MA is down 3% for the year. Food for thought if you are long on MA."
I mean how low is this going to go? No one can predict the bottom or buy at the bottom but what is the cut off line within reason?
Credit card business has never been easy if you look at the history from the beginning. I’m glad we closed in green today as well.
"Not amused. Can’t help but to wait. Don’t panic sell, fellow investors."
Going to be a slow and long recovery for payment stocks for sure! Until travel picks up and Covid kind of fades it’ll be very volatile or downward action.
Any Green Day is a good day
MA has been under performing by a wide margin all year. Perhaps it has lost it’s duopolistic advantage. Big investors who sold off lots of shares must know what’s going on?!￼￼￼￼
Over or under $360 by earnings?
"Big runs up, big runs down. This is how this stock trades. I've seen it weather much worse this past year. I've stuck with it, taken profits where it made sense. Every long term investor should have either V or MA as part of their portfolio. This gets back to 400 in the next 60 days."
Not going to be easy to get to $400 until COVID becomes yesterday’s news. We keep running up and hitting a wall.
"MA is still trading in the bargain zone territory for a rapidly evolving global juggernaut global business —that’s growing stronger with recent brilliant strategic Mgmt actions to bolster and deliver more growth!*** MA has become so much more compelling business, and investment!"
I will just keep adding in this $342-$344 range. Nothing wrong with this company at all. Pure manipulation.

"forever stock, buy and hold"
"Shorts borrowed 400,000 more REKR shares this morning and failed to dip the price (so dips are opportunities). LETS ROLL! Great things happening at Rekor -- how many young companies land deals with $TSLA, $MA, $VRRM, every border contractor, state governments, local governments, and various other corporations? Listen to Warren Buffett, buy good companies at a good price and hold them (dont trade). I am dreaming of a $GME like squeeze! LOL Have a great day!"
"FWIW, here is part of a note from Jim Cramer's advisory letter on MA. His charitable trust added to its position yesterday.Lastly, regarding any pressure resulting from Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) products, as Jim and Jeff previously discussed during the Daily Rundown, here, with international travel expected to rebound and consumers set to return to experiential activities, such as dining out, we think buyers will continue to reach for traditional credit cards thanks to the rewards points programs this payment method offers, unlike BNPL products such as Affirm (AFRM) .As a result, given our belief that the supply dynamic is transient, that the demand will sustain and ultimately be met thanks to the strength of consumer balance sheets, and that Mastercard serves as a natural hedge against the still uncertain inflation dynamic, we view the weakness as an opportunity to add exposure and reduce our overall cost basis as shares are trading roughly $12 below or last buy level."
Where is Peter the Pumper? He don't post here no more?
MA will be rallying back hugely tmr!
down as much as fb lol.
"Note from Credit Suisse on AFRM...........BNPL Remains a Nascent Payment Method: As of 2020, BNPL claimed just ~1.6%penetration (Worldpay estimate) of the US eCommerce market vs. ~6% in EMEA as of 2019,with much higher penetration in select markets (e.g., 25% in Sweden, ~18% in Germany,~8% in Australia). As a highly attractive offering for tech-savvy millennial and Gen Zconsumers who are more distrustful of traditional financial institutions and products, Affirmenables these consumers to obtain financing for purchases without risk of hidden fees, latefees, or surprise interest charges. Worldpay forecasts BNPL to grow to ~3% penetration ofUS eCommerce volumes by 2023, representing ~$50b, and we estimate that AFRM couldclaim ~35% market share.BNPL is clearly going to take more and more share away from CC's."
"These remaining 3 1/2 years cannot come fast enough, not sure if we keep up these policies, we can survive."
This is a good opportunity to add on these kinds of dips early in today’s session.— It’s still early in the session!
"MasterCard margins have been flat for years, the execs need to improve that for the stock price to grow rapidly."
Oversold
Jeez. What in the world. Markets up 500 points and MA is red. What gives with this company.

And COVID Delta hurts. Spending is slowing and cross boarded travel is slowing again.
This will see $300 again before it ever sees $400.
$400 plus by end of September. $450 holiday time!! Mark my words 100%%
With an rsi of 31 this should be getting bought up soon. It’s oversold by weak hands.
Going to $320ish by end ofThe month! You heard it here first. Sell all
"this stock is done for, we're going back to cheques and crypto"
"I added to V and MA a couple of days ago. Imo, still very attractive at this level. I'm holding long positions in both. Also opened a position in the RESP. Got at least 12 years to go for that."
MA is current trading in “extreme oversold territory”!
"The hospitality sector got a small hit today but as long as domestic tourism has their earning right, I can’t see the payment section going south.For instance Marriott, St Regis, InterContinental and Four Seasons have gained customers from the lower-middle-class by renovating their prices and services accordingly.Nevertheless, value investors know that these kinds of companies are not for day traders so we’ll see what have happened in the Q3 report."
"JPM today adjusts MA price target upward to $430, and reiterates Buy!"
Why it keeps dropping like a rock? Any valid reasons?
Analysts saying that MA and V should be scared of purchase by square. This is so much money in the fintech!! Long love MA!! Will be just fine. Let sellers sell and this will start to fly.
MA and V are in oversold trading territory at current trading levels!
"Understanding that Delta is causing concern over a rebound in travel I find MA @ $350ish to be inexplicable. Is the market also concerned about consumer spending given the coming end to unemployment bennies? The analyst's numbers haven't budged. Could this also be about the ""buy now pay later"" trend that was in the spotlight after SQ's acquisition? MA at this price doesn't make sense to me."
"Added again here at $340 and I added twice before on this August drop since $400, enough is enough!!!! I won't touch more unless goes under $320. For everyone here and for myself, I hope there is no opportunity for me to add again.MA needs to start going back up as I have to think at $340 which is the price point just before the drop due to COVID back in March 2020 must be a bottom. Let me repeat in March 2020 before COVID came to the world MA was at $340..........basically we have gone no where."
Disappointing that we have such a weak bounce back today
"Markets continue to be fixated on the delta bug, as fear thereof is fueled by the media. BUT anyone following the daily case-count numbers can see that the ""surge"" is fading rapidly. The media chooses not to focus on that, but ultimately it will have to be broadly acknowledged. At that point if not sooner, watch MA and V zoom."
100% oversold big time. Easy long term profit 100% may the longs be with you
Whiners need to stick to their day jobs. Investing is way challenging for you.
"The employment numbers might scare the market a bit. Hold on tight, fellow shareholders."
"There is a MarketBeat chart on Google showing more than $1 billion of MasterCard stock sold by insiders sold and none bought since the beginning of last year. If that's true, that's a problem."
MA remains in bargain territory and will provide huge upside for investors adding at these “bargain basement levels”!
forever stock
forever stock. im rich buying this last week. $V
josh brown sold yesterday
AMZN and AFRM announced a deal that has AFRM up $30 in the PM. Buy now pay later is becoming a bigger trend. Not good for legacy CC companies. (I own a little MA).
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAj
52 week high coming tomorrow. MA is much more diversified than Visa and better management.
"Mastercard has been a weak performer lately, but shares are finally waking up today and we see a couple of reasons for the solid 3% move. First up is the surprise retail sales beat for September. A retail sales beat is always a great sign of a healthy consumer who is willing to spend. And when the consumer spends, they are more likely to do so with plastic and electronic payments over paper, representing the secular shift that has and will continue to play into Mastercard’s favor for years to come. Second, cross-border travel is about to get a big boost. The White House announced this morning that fully vaccinated international travelers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and other countries are allowed into the United States beginning November 8th. This is fanatic news for Mastercard. Cross-border volumes — a high margin business —is what has lagged throughout the economic recovery because of countries closing their borders in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. But with the U.S. opening its doors to visitors, cross-border spending is soon about to get the much-needed jolt that Mastercard needs for better earnings."
"Globalist 15% tax scheme approved. But, ""80 million"" people in the USA voted for that..."
Such a phony how much the stock sank in the morning. Hedge funds know and bought on low. Will just go up from here
MA ＆ V and the King ＆ Queen. Love this dip!
back to 400s in no time
"Why are so many people selling when all the analysts are saying $400+? People are traveling more, cultural institutions are opening.. we were near 400 just a couple of weeks ago??"
Finally some green for a change.
Nice to seem some conviction back

Soon, Oil will be USELESS and WORTHLESS, but the US Market Makers are seeing commodities as PUMP and DUMP Schemes!!!$AMD $NVDA $AMZN $AAPL $SQ $SHOP $SNAP $TWLO $CRM $ROKU $ADBE $DB $BAC $JPM $MS $GS $TWTR $TSLA $IBM $INTC $MSFT $GOOG $LMT $BA $TXN $NXPI $LRCX $NKE $DIS $EBAY $X $MA $V $S $T $F $GM $NFLX $CSCO $CAT $MMM $SBUX $TGT $WMT $ATVI $EA $TTWO $MCD $AVGO $JNJ $BIDU $BZUN $BABA $MU $AMAT $QCOM $WFC $BBBY $PFE $GE $WDC $BLK $KO $UA $ABBV $GILD $BB $ORCL $RH $KEM $IQ $GRPN $PYPL $MA $MOMO $JD $WBA $CVS $FB $W $BBY $SKX $FL $EFX $ETSY $W $UNH $SAP $GPRO $KHC $DPZ $PEP $LYFT $UBER $BYND $ZM $OLED $XOM $CVX $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $SAVE $AXP $SPCE $NCLH $CCL $NKLA $NIO $ZM $XPEV $QShttps://www.businessinsider.com/national-debt-problem-of-free-money-stimulus-checks-covid-relief-2021-1?r=DE&IR=T"
Where will MA be on 12/31/2021? My guess is $370.
Market skyrockets and we’re down. Who is doing all the selling?
A start in the right direction! Let’s see what happens
"From reading the comments posted on this message board, I realize there are many newbie investors with little experience in equity markets. Regardless of what you post on this message board, it has no effect on the share price. 95% of the volume on big cap stocks such as Mastercard is from institutions. And they do NOT visit message boards to base their trades on. I've been a share holder of MA and V since their respective IPO's.Both are growth stocks, with earnings & profits increasing year after year.Hold on to your shares, you will be rewarded."
How much lower?
"supppppp! getting MA 1st thing this morning, i predict nothing short of juicy within weeks! shes pathetically priced and primes for massive launch; till then, do enjoy the party!"
The inflation moderation numbers earlier today is highly favorable to MA & V over the near and long term!
Has to be concerning that we can’t get out of this rut. Every run up is met with an immediate push back down. News is mostly optimistic. Insider trading this year has been overwhelmingly sell which tells you more than anything. MA foundation sold 800k shares in August.
"With a little luck, we can get to $400 by 2023."
Maybe it’ll finish green for once. Problem is drops $5-10 but then only goes up $1/2
Literally just bought the bottom (339.00). that never happens.
I heard about MA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"MA goes to 420 by EOY. Delta headwind in effect presently. As soon as the market sniffs a peak in the delta variant data, MA and V will fly. MA had a phenomenal beat/raise quarter and then corrected 11%. Fundamentals are pristine, big cash position. If Delta peaks this weekend, as Dr. Gottlieb, has indicated is a good possibility, this explodes to the upside."
buy buy buy buy buy
Great opportunity to pick up MA&V shares at a discount!
Major insider selling ever since stellar earnings report. Obviously they know something.
People are buying the rumors and selling the news. Even if MA reports great numbers we may see red tomorrow.
Lost a lot of support; looks like the teens will be next stop if something doesn't stop this bleeding
We have a heartbeat!
Hope the £10 billion suit doesn’t add up to much. This seems to be a bi annual event.
Hey look at that. It’s green!!!!
$340 by the end of the week!
"Relax folks, MA has returned a cool average of 30%+ annually since inception, and V an average of 25%+ since inception, vs. 10% annually for the S&P 500. Remember to keep things in perspective when it feels like the ship is sinking."
"With rising revenues, acquisitions, buckets of buybacks and share price still falling, how can this company not be a buy?"
way oversold. all in into this dip
"Consumers spent at a much faster pace than expected in September, defying expectations for a pullback amid pervasive supply chain problems, the Census Bureau reported Friday.Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Excluding auto-related sales, the number rose 0.8%, better than the 0.5% forecast.Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9% on the headline number and 15.6% excluding autos."
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
Why is this getting hammered so badly? Everywhere I look this has price targets well into the 400's
"at 330 I will buy with 50k, this is unfairly being hit"
"Singapore is gonna open up soon and the world will be observing it's roadmap. If the strategy works out, more country will follow it and open up and ultimately, travel/tourism sector will boom again. I would say, this will come around Q2, Q3 of next year. That's when VISA and master will fly. Keep gathering it when it's beaten down. The world will open up one way or another."
"The trick with this stock, like many others is to buy on dips and never sell. Don't worry about the price going up because that takes care of itself. Looking to start a position soon but am hoping for a bit lower entry point."
"There are stong concerns about The Fed.... The tapering.... & Rising Rates leading to a potential Market Sell-Off. Some are hedging, others are selling so they have enough ""dry powder"" for if/when theres a sizeable drop in Market..."
This stock has lost a lot of confident buyers!
MA needs some life support. Who’s going to help out?
Absurd jpm up
"I do not get why MA is down today and more importantly why it is stuck down here after hitting $400 not so long ago. People are shopping and spending and traveling and feasting and doing everything else that uses a credit card, and we are not even in the full blown holiday season.Yes inflation is prevalent and yes we have supply chain issues...........but people are spending early and buying lots of stuff.Sooner or later MA and V will catch up with reality, and this will be a very important ER and guidance. We will get the signal if MA talks to spending levels prior to ER. I am looking out for comments from Mgmt that they see strong spending signs as people are shopping early."
"Huge consumer spend, and GS outstanding and resounding beat in the pre-Market opening served as catalysts— bolstering financial sector and is a harbinger of good Qtr reporting to come from MA and V!*** The “gynecologist duo” are on HUGE sale at these current trading levels!"
Time to shutdown my screen and try to think about something positive in my life
"Affirm $AFRM collects a fee of 4% - 5% of transactions they process from their merchants... In comparison Visa $V and Mastercard $MA collect less than 1%. Traders bouncing around this stock are misunderstanding the moat here, specifically with their blue-chip partnerships. Today Affirm is processing roughly $1B per month and huge expectations for growth specifically from their Amazon deal, which the details have not been disclosed yet."
"What the heck is going on with MA?! It was one of my top performers, now it's a pile of ship."
I'm in at 340
How disappointed is that Market is up but V and Ma are down
So I haven’t been watching MasterCard for a while & just noticed how far it has fallen. What happened?
At 60 times earnings strong growth is expected of MA. Anything less and it would drop like a rock. This kind of growth keeps it stable. Don’t expect too much more in the way of price increases. American Express has a PE of 20 if you were to compare the two.
Air travel and hospitality industries will be wide open as U.S. announced this morning that it will be open to vaccinated international travelers!*** This will be a boon for MA & V!
$v and $ma will go back up anyway. esoecially on a market correction lol
paypal passed ma in market cap
There is a level of support at $325. May wait until it drops around there to stuff the bag...
MA is currently trading at a discount in in oversold territory!
Great day….. let’s hope for some days stacked together!!
It's better to sell your MA even at loss to prevent further loss
Smart buy here. Tyvm
This is the new $V and $MA pplJust buy it and leave it
"MA & V remains on sale at these bargain level pullback in two of the great long term — wealth creating, global businesses of our lifetime!"
"I own a lot of MA stock for 14 years. Way up. MA is falling because of Covid. Less international travel...where MA makes higher margins. And generally less spending as people go out less, drive less, etc."
I just got an e-mail from MA suggesting I.........Explore all the payment and borrowing options that may be available to you. They are trying to expand their BNPL options.
Give it another month or two and will see some great upward action/movement!! May the longs be with you!!
"I’m a long time holder, and will add more if it keeps dropping."
Can't go wrong with this blue chip stock
I’d probably start a position at $300 lol. The valuation is still rich considering the new competition.
I would buy every dip possible on this stock!! Long term you’ll be rewarded with diamond hands
why MA stock is down?same down action to AXP and V.
good opportunity to buy long forever
Why south today??
"MA IS GOING DOWN rather strongly not just a few weeks - but starting from April-May. On the bullish side:- spending is all-time-high: projected revenue for the quarter are $5B versus $3.9B year ago, almost30%- projected earnings are also all-time-high- almost all on WallStreet are bullish, with target price $85 above current price.***I do not understand it. Visa V, which always was underperforming MA and has WORSE fundamentals, behave much better now: last 3 mo it's up 2% while MA is down 2%.***I cannot explain this, but I'm NOT SELLING my call spreads - just rolling them further, even bought a few more recently. Maybe some mighty groups manipulating stock? - ""conspiracy theory""? :-)Good Luck to everybody - Emanuil"
"Not sure why we keep getting a sell off, but if it hits 310 or below, I’m in for another 500. Until then, I’m just holding tight."
Hate to see a market selloff now when MA is already down 15%
Good grief. How much longer is this downward slide going to go on?
Would love to know who is doing what seems to be program selling....Down about 1% day after day. This is concerning.
BA is also a buy buy buy
Stock buy backs lol
What’s everyone thinking… 300 as the low?
"hedge funds must be selling .this looks like it will steadily declined, sad"
What is going on with MA? I have no thoughts about this stock.
I think we go sideways for the rest of the month!
MA will be right on the line of support at the opening bell
"First, if someone has high net-worth and wishes to invest-and-forget and sleep soundly knowing assets are well-positioned for the very long term, perhaps high returns are more safely and reliably expected with, for example AAPL and/or MSFT.However, I've analyzed MA by doing the following:1. Bring up the MA chart, full screen2. Have the time span be 2 years3. Go to the indicators and bring up the ""Williams %R"" using the default settings, i.e., a 14-day period, -20 indicating overbought and -80 indicating oversold.3a. Note: I use the Williams %R value to inform me of an entry point to buy stock, provided the company is financially healthy, has a competitive business model, has a well-recognized and well-respected brand.4. Notice MA's Williams %R was about -98, i.e., extremely oversold, on 03SEPT. Please also note MA's William %R has been this oversold on very few occasions in the past 2 years...and each time it has recovered fairly well.5. Finally, please see MA's price peaks on, or about, 4/29/2021 & 7/29/2021, followed by the price declines in-between. I believe this may be due to stock traders taking profits when MA reports healthy earnings, then buying back-in between MA's earning periods. The next MA earning report is on, or about 10/28 or 29/2021.My hypothesis is that MA will increase [overall] from here as the next earnings date approaches.I respectfully ask for your thoughts."
Best time to add to your MA long position is before the closing bell — lest you forget that MA Qtr Earnings report is released in the pre- Market opening tomorrow!
What is going on with MasterCard?
I give up gonna cash out lol
"43% profit margin and 109% return on shareholder equity, this stock is a no brainer. Sit back and wait for another 10 for 1 split."
MA is trading in “gift horse ” territory.
The amount of bears commenting in here convinced me to buy more.
"I think we'll see a retest of 340 relatively soon. We'll see what happens, but I'm thinking 340 should be solid support and that there'll be some sideways accumulating action from there."
hahaha   stop drop day. upside next week
buying a new position
Easy money
Stock has dropped over 15% and we have an overall market correction coming sometime in the very near future ... wonderful.
MasterCard and visa were terrible investments. Too much competition.
Goldman Sachs says MA is one of 9 most popular stocks among hedge funds along with V!!! Long term will be amazing!!
its because the support isnt working smh
The recent results of bricks-and-mortars have seen substantial growth. I hope this helps MasterCard to generate more revenue.
"BNPL is a challenge too, Affirm is a case in point. SQ buying after pay."
Looks like weakness on the 10B to 15B class action suit against MA in the UK. Another money grab by foreign country milking US corporations. Mastercard sets interchange fees and the UK is arguing they were too high. Really? Nobody is forcing consumers or merchants to use them. They obviously found enough value in using MA and now they wanna complain they don't want to pay for it and want their money back. Total insanity. If I were MA I would say you toss this out or we will cut off card usage in the UK. One less competitor should help their claimed problem.
"MA should be $400 at this point; where pent up demand, willingness to travel and re-opening in general should have MA up. The worry/fear of Delta Variant is over-blown. It is less impactful for hospitalizations or death and vaccines are here.......no reason to keep people home."
"MA, V....just a disaster.....why?"
48 PE ratio. So basically a 2% return. So overvalued. This should be a 25-30 PE stock.
"IMHO, in August we will see some small correction. Anyone with me? No need to insult to disagree, just wondering how others feel about the market. GLTA! $MA $V $GOOGL $AMZN $CMCSA $JPM $SQ $VOO"
Big data MA owns is incredible. They also sell it to hedgefunds. This will be a key driver next 5 years. Most of the time MA knows better how a company is doing then the company itself lol
"Is this drop due to the AFRM deal with AMZN? One would think rising retail sales, pent up demand, travel increasing MA and V would benefit."
"@Gee You are speaking a perspective that reflects your own “small town zip code” in the mid-West. — but, I live in the San Diego metro area and Lowes & HomDepo parking lots are full and there’s huge busine going on!- Don’t assume the rest of U.S. is a reflection of your minuscule small town environment, pal!"
"I started investing in stocks 3 years ago. MA was one of the first companies I bought. I continued buying, and it is one of my bigger holdings. It did great for the first year and a half. But if we look at the chart, it is at basically the same price it was before the pandemic hit. 18 months with no increase. While most of my other stocks have made huge gains, or at least solid gains. Can someone tell me why?"
"eps growth is 20% a year, covid & 2008 are good base cases that show the strength and economic moat this company has. and they'll get back into india eventually my 12 month price target is $408"
"most of the fin stocks yesterday had a sizable drop, but the MasterCard Foundation just keeps selling. No good"
