"Is this drop due to the AFRM deal with AMZN? One would think rising retail sales, pent up demand, travel increasing MA and V would benefit."
"@Gee You are speaking a perspective that reflects your own “small town zip code” in the mid-West. — but, I live in the San Diego metro area and Lowes & HomDepo parking lots are full and there’s huge busine going on!- Don’t assume the rest of U.S. is a reflection of your minuscule small town environment, pal!"

MA has been left in the dust this year
This stock stays in correction territory like no other
"MA is way too cheap to ignore at these trading levels — when you consider the positive forward guidance, and its forward growth prospects over the next 12 thru 36 months that’s driving by the strength of its innovations , and MA’s mgmt outstanding response to maximally exploit its opportunities!"
stay down for a few more days so I can buy more LOL
Best time to add to your MA long position is before the closing bell — lest you forget that MA Qtr Earnings report is released in the pre- Market opening tomorrow!
Massive massive massive insider selling. Have to wonder what they know that the public is unaware of.
Just a stalemate stock right now. Too many issues holding it down.
$385 tomorrow opening bell! The boom of spending is back !! Long term let’s go MA!! May the longs be with you!!
Up or down tomorrow? I think we know which way this boy is headed.
MA is over value. sell sell sell.
Who is pulling MA down? Is this purely COVID related?
"Understanding that Delta is causing concern over a rebound in travel I find MA @ $350ish to be inexplicable. Is the market also concerned about consumer spending given the coming end to unemployment bennies? The analyst's numbers haven't budged. Could this also be about the ""buy now pay later"" trend that was in the spotlight after SQ's acquisition? MA at this price doesn't make sense to me."
MA is currently trading at a discount in in oversold territory!
What is going on?
Based on V we know MA's quarter was fine. Why the weakness? The run-up in to the report and.....of course.........COVID.
Is this a solid stock to hold for the long term in my portfolio?
MA is just getting started.Longs should be heartened that MA Qtr earnings report is just a few days away!*** It could be an off to races when MA releases its Qtr earnings report in pre-Market opening next Thursday!
"Absurd is the “short trolls”posting incessant SPAM & SCHLOCK day after day on this MA mssg board, and expecting MA longs to pull up anchor and run for the hills in panic and F.E.A.R in response to their obvious SCAM!—- Clean up your trash guys, MA is headed way, WAY higher!"
This a great gift horse buying opportunity in MA & V!
"Looking forward to Investor Day. Rekor would not have scheduled a meeting with analysts if they did not have important things to say. As we know, lots of positive things happening at Rekor. Some easily understood: REKR is working with ALL bidders on the US border. Clearly they will unpack the Waycare acquisition strategy. Challenge is some work is behind nondisclosure agreements with companies such as $TSLA and $MA . I assume the work with $VRRM is also behind a NDA, just dont recall hearing Rekor say that."
"Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Adjusts Mastercard PT to $420 From $383, Maintains Buy Rating"
Looks like weakness on the 10B to 15B class action suit against MA in the UK. Another money grab by foreign country milking US corporations. Mastercard sets interchange fees and the UK is arguing they were too high. Really? Nobody is forcing consumers or merchants to use them. They obviously found enough value in using MA and now they wanna complain they don't want to pay for it and want their money back. Total insanity. If I were MA I would say you toss this out or we will cut off card usage in the UK. One less competitor should help their claimed problem.
Analysts saying that MA and V should be scared of purchase by square. This is so much money in the fintech!! Long love MA!! Will be just fine. Let sellers sell and this will start to fly.
Would love to know who is doing what seems to be program selling....Down about 1% day after day. This is concerning.
down 1% like clockwork
Totally rigged look at gdf daily chart
People taking some profits today! Wait for the next week with earnings!! Think will be around $400 give or take
"Bought 500 shares @ $365Im long but this stock almost dead, @Peter please I need some encouragement Other stocks like $AXP got up almost 40% since the beginning of the year"
When does the bleeding stop?
Hope the £10 billion suit doesn’t add up to much. This seems to be a bi annual event.
How much lower?
"MA Qtr earnings will be released in 13 days.- MA’s revenues and profits will significantly beat Analyst expectations because of the strong holiday season spending, that saw above average consumer sales, and above avg travel over Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Yers holiday travel!*** That was the reason for the slew of analysts upgrades of MA to $375 - $400++ , and, for V’s upgrades to $225 - $250.*** MA and V are trading at odds with the strength of their business!- Buy and hold through these bargain basement prices for huge gains in a matter of weeks.- Play the rebound in these great businesses of our time — like Buffettology teaches."
Unfortunately it will drop tommorow like VISA. Don't know why . The visa reports was great
Like drop $20 today. I would buy 100% all day today. No way is it headed back down this much
Definitely upward trend.
They had some interesting insights about MA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"With a little luck, we may see $400 by 02/22."
Top and bottom line beats from V. It's down slightly in the AH but up $10 in the last week or so.
good opportunity to buy long forever
MA to retest $360-350 levels in coming weeks!
India ban on MasterCard with Ajay Banga as our executive chairman? Wow
"The trick with this stock, like many others is to buy on dips and never sell. Don't worry about the price going up because that takes care of itself. Looking to start a position soon but am hoping for a bit lower entry point."
Today’s open will be a new 52 week high… short covering in full force !
Ma financing domestic terorists/6.1/ insurectionists with robo call on Jan. 5
Big one day sell off and next day starts the recovery; never thought!
"MA has hit oversold territory at current trading levels, and is in prime position for a rebound on bargain hunting!"
MA & Visa are the best companies to invest in. Long term outlook remains strong. Buy and hold forever.
"Mastercard still has substantial long-term growth opportunities. E-commerce sales totaled only 13.4% of U.S. retail sales in the first quarter. More people will gradually shift away from cash transactions to electronic payments, providing a tailwind to Mastercard's business. With the economy cranking up, now is a good time to consider buying shares. Mastercard should see its transaction volume gradually accelerate back to pre-pandemic trends. Management reported during the first-quarter earnings report that it's already seeing significant pent-up demand for travel, which would boost transaction growth and revenue, providing a catalyst for a higher stock price."
Won’t go below $360.
"With “strong green” across the boards, and Visa trading solidly higher, I will contend that today’s MA rally to higher ground is merely delayed for a heated rush in the final hour and 45 minutes of this trading session!*** Patience is the prudent investor’s greatest greatest ally!"
It’s because everybody is getting into crypto. 
$385 by the end of the week! Long Ma
It got very toppy at $367...now back down to its normal range.This article suggests the stock has topped out and we cannot expect much more growth:https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/06/14/mastercard-stock-has-achieved-its-near-term-potential/?sh=36246c403382
"MA is finally gaining back momentum, MA has lagged V price action in recent weeks. MA has dropped 10% from its previous high of $398 and now looks to be building back. I think we get there in a week or two."
Is the dip due to the Square / Afterpay deal? Thanks for the buy opportunity.
MA will be right on the line of support at the opening bell
forever stock
This sell off is ridiculous. People are acting like no body is using their credit cards. Why would you sell visa and MasterCard. Everyone uses credit cards .
Worries about MA here. Think we’re going down for the month of July.
Not going to be easy to get to $400 until COVID becomes yesterday’s news. We keep running up and hitting a wall.
Peter what’s going on with MA?
52 week high coming tomorrow. MA is much more diversified than Visa and better management.
Buy into this dip for HUGE gains after the profit-takers exit the stage!*** MA is headed to new all time highs as soon as next week!- MA longs have seen this “opportunistic play” on many occasions over the years!
Good grief. How much longer is this downward slide going to go on?
Buy now pay later.
"AMX awesome Qtr earnings report and uber-positive forward guidance is a sample of what MA & V will deliver in their Qtr reports in a matter of days, next week!"
MA is trading in “gift horse ” territory.
A little news and pop!
"This isn't a meme stock. It's a ""meh"" stock."
Down 2% on above average volume. I wish I understood why so I could make a decision about what to do.
395 easy breezy tomorrow
"Reuters) - Mastercard Inc said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.The credit-card giant's announcement comes days after Elon Musk's Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.Asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.Mastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.""Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,"" Mastercard said. (https://mstr.cd/3tLaPZM)Mastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)"
"MA IS GOING DOWN rather strongly not just a few weeks - but starting from April-May. On the bullish side:- spending is all-time-high: projected revenue for the quarter are $5B versus $3.9B year ago, almost30%- projected earnings are also all-time-high- almost all on WallStreet are bullish, with target price $85 above current price.***I do not understand it. Visa V, which always was underperforming MA and has WORSE fundamentals, behave much better now: last 3 mo it's up 2% while MA is down 2%.***I cannot explain this, but I'm NOT SELLING my call spreads - just rolling them further, even bought a few more recently. Maybe some mighty groups manipulating stock? - ""conspiracy theory""? :-)Good Luck to everybody - Emanuil"
Why is everyone so quiet when we go down? Who is buying??
MA will be rallying back hugely tmr!
"@bob. You must have eaten your Wheaties today. Pretty good slam on @peter. MA is a good long term play. Great for young investors, your kids, and grandkids."
"Worth $362B! Sure, way OVER VALUED"
"$V is Back on the Growth Train! Q3 Results were even better than Q3 2019 by 10+% on earnings (1.49 vs 1.35) & 5% on revenue (6.13B vs 5.84B)!Buy your growth train tickets now.. Travel industry still opening in the U.S. & still has to open worldwide - this is not even considering the US economy only really started opening up in late May to early June (only 4-6 weeks of Q3).Now, Factor in the upcoming Fee increases, rest of the world opening up as well as other high growth areas such as India where other CC companies such as $MA & Amex are currently banned from adding new clients & this train will be flying"
MA is underappreciated by Wall Street for years:It is time to scoop MA shares at these grossly undervalued prices when MA has so many catalysts ahead!Aggressive buy!
"I’m very confident this will go back to $400. Not because I’m pumping but because the numbers and subsequent situation as an entirity looking healthy.For swing traders - don’t swing trade this one, this is not a quick buck machine."
Vix going down and market will be 300 points up
"What the heck is going on with MA?! It was one of my top performers, now it's a pile of ship."
"Short TROLLS are in HUGE FEAR & PANIC and are out early with their SCHLOCK & SPAMMING RUSE!*** AMX delivery of great Qtr Earnings report in the Pre-opening has blown their SCAM to bits, and they are hoping MA longs will not notice and be distracted by their early pollution of MA Mssg board!"
"I don't know how many Cramer fans are out there but for what it's worth I subscribe to his stock advice service. He just initiated a position (last week and today) with an average cost of $367, the target being $425. He thinks concerns over the SQ acquisition are overblown, attributing the some of the recent weakness to Delta concerns."

COVID is spreading rapidly again. That's why it's down.
"Typical, going lower so the big boys make more when earnings are announced"
"This goes to the new or recent shareholders of both $V and $MA. Just be patient, last year these two stocks were slow but steady for the months of Aug, Sept and Oct. Once you get passed those you'll be glad that you held. I've gone through this same scenario last year and held strong because I believe in both companies. Never selling these two stocks! Long term investment. I'm just hoping they split shares so I can accumulate more. GLTA"
$385 tomorrow!!

"V knocked it out of the park in the AH:*** Visa (NYSE:V): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 beats by $0.14; GAAP EPS of $1.18 misses by $0.17.- Revenue of $6.13B (+26.7% Y/Y) beats by $270M.- Net revenues of $6.1B, an increase of 27%. Net revenues growth would have been 39% if service revenues were recognized on current quarter's payments volume.- Payment volume 34% vs. 26.2% consensus."

MA presents a great buying opportunity before its upcoming Qtr report in 3 weeks!
I’d probably start a position at $300 lol. The valuation is still rich considering the new competition.
MA will start rallying back tmr 07/01! 
"Greeting Long Term Mastercard Investors.I've been a shareholder of Mastercard for approx. 12 years. I was orginally invested in Visa yet decided to switch my portfolio to Mastercard as it is growing earnings at a slightly faster pace. Both companies are superior in my opinion. I am a retail investor like the rest of the crowd on this message board and I am a firm believer in both Visa & Mastercard long term growth prospects. I know there have been several other players in the payments space, yet, most rely on the infastructure and piggy back on MA & V network backbone. The barrier to entry is enormous, thus, no company has been able to penetrate what V & MA have created in terms of a worldwide processing network, which required billions of dollars of several decades. I have learned in my 12 years of owning both V & MA that they are a buy and hold on any dip in share price. Here are some things to ponder.1. 80% of the world still uses cash for transactions 2. Online Shopping is growing at an exponential rate.3. MA & V are just getting started, based on the #1 & #24. Both companies are shareholder freindly, buying back billions of dollars of shares on an annual basis. MA had 1.4 million a few years ago (afer a 10:1 slit) now share count id down significantly, which increases share price and EPS.5. If you look at historical figures going back over 30nyears, regardless of what the economy was performing on a yearly basis, MA & V always made a profit and grew eps. Even during the great recession (08/09) and Covid (20/21) both companies reported a profit and earnings growth. 6. MA and V have spent the last year consolidating (look at the one year graph), a huge basis was formed. Now that the economy is slowly recovering, fund managers and institutions have been buying back into both companies. Remeber 90% of share volume is by institutions, not retail investors. These institutions know, that once the economy is running on all 8 cylinders, Ma & V EPS will be exploding higher. This is why they have been buying shares and driving the share price up much higher, almost on a daily basis. 7. The more hotels rooms booker (airbnb) the better MA does, The more Apple phones are sold, the better MA does (most poeple pay with a credit card for a $1000 phone). The better Amazon does in online sales, the better MA does, the more houses sold (people buying furniture) the better MA does, the list goes on and on and on......etc......MA increase in value approx. 30-40% on yearly basis. Give or take a few points.Hold on to your shares and you will rewarded in the future.Peace & Cash to the Masses"

"MA goes to 420 by EOY. Delta headwind in effect presently. As soon as the market sniffs a peak in the delta variant data, MA and V will fly. MA had a phenomenal beat/raise quarter and then corrected 11%. Fundamentals are pristine, big cash position. If Delta peaks this weekend, as Dr. Gottlieb, has indicated is a good possibility, this explodes to the upside."
Just added for the first time since $139
Come on MA we need some good news
"I've been long MA for many years, and do not plan on selling for many more. That being said, if we ever hit $300 again, I am loading up on more."
"Sellers became an “endangered species” after exhausting themselves following yesterday’s record sell off volume — running in unreasonable F.E.A.R for the safety of the hills!*** That’s why I made my “MA gift horse buying opportunity call” going onto yesterday’s closing bell!- Yesterday’s “panic action” called for a strong “contrarian investing counter action”, per Buffettology-101."
Lost a lot of support; looks like the teens will be next stop if something doesn't stop this bleeding
hahaha   stop drop day. upside next week
The short “SCHLOCK & SPAMMING TROLLS” are back for their daily visit to see if they can scare as many “weak hands” from the MA playing field as they can!
"Split should be coming soon, so MA will get stronger in the higher gear !"
"Riddle me this.......why is MA stuck here around mid $360's and will not move no matter the news about re-opening, retailers doing well, amzn revenue sky high, cash in consumers hand and summer time is here. It may take a stock split to begin a crawl back to a $400 basis.Please any opinion welcome!"
What’s the news? Why are we down $11?
Stock still stuck on the slow boat to China...I'll be unloading my remaining MA shares when the one year point comes due.
It is a 378 billion market cap for someone who posted just getting started the other day.
Nice movement today...am I missing some important news?

I’ve been saying for weeks now it’s not going over $370 for quite some time.
"MA at $400 very soon....be patient my friends! I just sold a dog stock and put it all in MA and V. Don;t let me down, I believe select retail and credit card companies will be winners for the summer surge.GLTA"
Thinking $350 before $370. Comments please? Let’s see what all you pro investors know about MA? Peter? All insight welcome.
This is too much
"4 those moving some $$ to other payment co, $V-Visa is now back in serious growth (40%+ YOY EPS growth & 26.6% YOY Rev growth) w/o huge share price growth as others during pandemic. These figures are just the start as the U.S. economy was just starting to open the 2nd half of Q3 & travel (where $V makes a lot of it’s $$ is just getting started). Forget to mention the rest of the world just starting to open, Fee increases coming in the future as well as high growth rates in countries like India where other Credit Card companies such as $MA and Amex are now banned in adding any new users due to breaking India’s Data laws and its got a long streak ahead!** I am a current owner of $PYPL, $V & $MA"
People are buying the rumors and selling the news. Even if MA reports great numbers we may see red tomorrow.
"It’s a great time to go bargain hunting in MA & V into today’s closing bell for huge gains as soon as tomorrow!- This pullback was way, WAY overdone in a an “ephemeral negative” error!- This error is your “gift horse buying opportunity” for prudent and cognoscenti investors!!!"
Over or under $390 end of the week? Predictions please!!!
$400 plus by end of September. $450 holiday time!! Mark my words 100%%
At 60 times earnings strong growth is expected of MA. Anything less and it would drop like a rock. This kind of growth keeps it stable. Don’t expect too much more in the way of price increases. American Express has a PE of 20 if you were to compare the two.
Options are saying we go to $400 by Friday. Let's go.
down five tomorrow you say?

"Could be wrong but down 10% in a month with no news, a month or so before all the bid spending holidays sounds like a buying opportunity here. I’m in and will average down if needed. GLTA"
"With rising revenues, acquisitions, buckets of buybacks and share price still falling, how can this company not be a buy?"
"JPM today adjusts MA price target upward to $430, and reiterates Buy!"
MA ＆ V and the King ＆ Queen. Love this dip!

CNBC just #$%$ on MA.
Started a small long position today!
Remember last month when you wished you had taken advantage of the big dip then missed 390s?
"What has really been in the news as one of the most profitable investments in the world, I really don't understand much about it"
"MA should be $400 at this point; where pent up demand, willingness to travel and re-opening in general should have MA up. The worry/fear of Delta Variant is over-blown. It is less impactful for hospitalizations or death and vaccines are here.......no reason to keep people home."
Hey look at that. It’s green!!!!
This stock is in the dog house. What’s going on and what will it take to get out of this bad mess?
This is a long term forever stock!! You never sell it!! It’ll go up year over year. Just a down time but will come back stronger than ever. 100% no doubt. Should have a solid few months remaining with holidays approaching. May the longs be with you!!
I would buy every dip possible on this stock!! Long term you’ll be rewarded with diamond hands
BUY this MA dip for huge gains on next week’s “barn burner”Qtr earnings report!
Where is this downward pressure coming from?
Going to be a slow and long recovery for payment stocks for sure! Until travel picks up and Covid kind of fades it’ll be very volatile or downward action.
Jeez this thing looks like the most shorted stock of the month lol.
"Visa will report in today’s AH, and that will provide a few key clues to MA’s earnings report!"
Let’s go MA! Buy buy buy!! Let’s do it big for rest of the month!!
Gdmf bs
"@Anonymous, Bob & Greg:Yesterday, I was only trying to offer you blokes a perspective from my 10 year experience being long MA!- MA & V are two of the great businesses of our time, my “gift horse call” yesterday was made in my long term view of the “global power of the dynamic duos businesses, rather than from your very short term trading horizon!"
Its just dark clouds on $V and $MA nowadays..will get through this very soon and we will have our smile back again Stay long
AMZN and AFRM announced a deal that has AFRM up $30 in the PM. Buy now pay later is becoming a bigger trend. Not good for legacy CC companies. (I own a little MA).
how will this stock compare to visa down the road now that it's banned from issuing new cards in India?
Goldman Sachs says MA is one of 9 most popular stocks among hedge funds along with V!!! Long term will be amazing!!
Peter what happen? Went up to $380 and down trend. Options puts for $370 and lower now. Not looking good for Ma
earnings beat
Interesting factsA) steady insider sale by MA Foundation and officers everyday with increasing volumes.B) 2019 Q4 earnings surprise was barely 4%. C) tech chart looks very weakSo both don't look very good as of now. Let's hope MA surprise us with good results.
next week should be upside
"market does not like MA, so I am out now:"
"have been watching MA for a while, 5M bull candle at the bottom, will be near 400 soon again."
On 8/27/2020 we were higher than we are today.
"hedge funds must be selling .this looks like it will steadily declined, sad"
"Earnings season is close at hand, and the U.S. Economic rebound will provide favorable winds to MA & V sails from this upcoming Qtr earnings report to over the next 24 to 36 months!*** Look for blowout Y/Y comparisons, and very bullish forward guidance during this earnings season."
"Travel, restaurants and entertainment is huge in the US and Britain. And with US tax payers footing the bill to eventually vaccinate the rest of the world, MA should do well 2nd half of 2021"
"As a 19 year old UK investor, this is one of the best stocks I have found. I bought in at $195 and will be holding long term. Looking to buy Visa soon too but wary of a correction. Great stock"
This is the new $V and $MA pplJust buy it and leave it
Waiting to break through 401.50. Should be soon.
"Singapore is gonna open up soon and the world will be observing it's roadmap. If the strategy works out, more country will follow it and open up and ultimately, travel/tourism sector will boom again. I would say, this will come around Q2, Q3 of next year. That's when VISA and master will fly. Keep gathering it when it's beaten down. The world will open up one way or another."
Not good news out of India with MA. Could see a massive sell off by end of the week! Watch the news closely.
Will drop $4 Day end
Long & Strong $MA.......
Ma will be $400 before you know it! Thinking around $440 after earnings!! Let’s get it. May the longs be with you!!
Today Baird adjust MA up to $482 from $454 and maintains outperform rating.
Just about holding steady with bad news of retail sales
"Good buy point today. This happens every so often, then the next day it'll pop 3-5%."
Running PMCC...hope this stock just chills for the next 3 years ;)
"#$%$ There is no reason for a 4% correction today in MA.....is it fears of inflation? I find that counter to the cash flush being promoted by gov't sending money to everyone for everything imaginable. Is it fear of rising interest rates? I find that also counter as people use credit regardless and MA money is made on the transaction.Again, no reason to be down $13 plus."
I say up $10 tomorrow after earnings release!
Dead board when we drop. Where are all the pumpers?
"I use my MasterCard everyday, shopping on Amazon as well. Not going to change that. Good time to buy more shares at a discounted price. Thumbs up if you feel the same"
Why is MA selling off before earnings and V earnings?
Give it another six months and we'll make it to $400.
Down with the ship we go
20% undervalued.
"Shorts borrowed 400,000 more REKR shares this morning and failed to dip the price (so dips are opportunities). LETS ROLL! Great things happening at Rekor -- how many young companies land deals with $TSLA, $MA, $VRRM, every border contractor, state governments, local governments, and various other corporations? Listen to Warren Buffett, buy good companies at a good price and hold them (dont trade). I am dreaming of a $GME like squeeze! LOL Have a great day!"
Let’s go MA. ComeOn. May the longs be with you!!
I'm so afraid this is going to drop down. How can I get over my fears.
The valuation (PE) for this co is just WAY WAY too high.
MA remains in bargain territory and will provide huge upside for investors adding at these “bargain basement levels”!
why MA stock is down?same down action to AXP and V.
MA trading in oversold territory and presents a nice opportunity for MA longs with the ability and conviction to add at these bargain levels!
This will be making a run to 400 in the next two weeks. Get on board with some in the money calls. I am looking at the 370 call that expires July 16.
Looks like it’s going to close positive today as earnings tomorrow before open $400 anytime or higher
The recent results of bricks-and-mortars have seen substantial growth. I hope this helps MasterCard to generate more revenue.
Where are all the sellers??
$340 by the end of the week!
Very nice rebound off oversold conditions earlier today!*** The journey back to $400 begins with an almost imperceptible first step…
more and more shorts exiting daily$WIMI $MA $NIO
Is it fair to see $MA $800 share in five years?
All the big brokers are saying MA up and yet we’re falling pretty steadily. Who is doing all the selling?
"if american express beats earnings tomorrow morning, I wonder if a rising tide will lift MasterCard and visa stock along with it?"
What is going on with MasterCard?
MA will have a stellar week ahead! Great tome to buy buy buy!! May the longs be with you!! Hoping for $375-380 by weeks end!!
We are at a great buying opportunity for MA stock at these current trading levels!
"this is oversold completely, but has also crossed SMA 50 and 100. could dip a bit lower and then go back up. bullish in future"
"Note from Credit Suisse on AFRM...........BNPL Remains a Nascent Payment Method: As of 2020, BNPL claimed just ~1.6%penetration (Worldpay estimate) of the US eCommerce market vs. ~6% in EMEA as of 2019,with much higher penetration in select markets (e.g., 25% in Sweden, ~18% in Germany,~8% in Australia). As a highly attractive offering for tech-savvy millennial and Gen Zconsumers who are more distrustful of traditional financial institutions and products, Affirmenables these consumers to obtain financing for purchases without risk of hidden fees, latefees, or surprise interest charges. Worldpay forecasts BNPL to grow to ~3% penetration ofUS eCommerce volumes by 2023, representing ~$50b, and we estimate that AFRM couldclaim ~35% market share.BNPL is clearly going to take more and more share away from CC's."
Can we just finish the month of august already. Thank god this month is almost over!! Let’s move onto September already!! It can’t be much worse than august. May the longs be with you 100%!!!!
More red lll
Markets way up over last couple days but this thing only goes up a few dollars. Still stuck in mud. MUST split again to get momentum.
MA & V are on sale at current trading levels before their pending Qtr earnings report in the next 3 weeks!*** Check today’s Oppenheimer’s upgrade of Visa’s price target to $281.
"Couldn’t help but to wire money in for the first.Cheers, fellow shareholders."
I just bought more.
Give it another month or two and will see some great upward action/movement!! May the longs be with you!!
Hedges forcing the price down before earnings lolllll
Another day market grinds higher while MA flat lines or goes down. Morningstar 331 fair market value price target looks about right.
"The hospitality sector got a small hit today but as long as domestic tourism has their earning right, I can’t see the payment section going south.For instance Marriott, St Regis, InterContinental and Four Seasons have gained customers from the lower-middle-class by renovating their prices and services accordingly.Nevertheless, value investors know that these kinds of companies are not for day traders so we’ll see what have happened in the Q3 report."
Maybe it’ll finish green for once. Problem is drops $5-10 but then only goes up $1/2
sell sell sell sell sell
"going to 400, forever stock. shorts are trolling"
Look at the 6 month and 5 year charts. I'm not worried about MA. This isnt a stock to day trade. This is long term.
MA YTD 3% vs S&P 500 15%
I’m curious to know who is selling MA and why? What’s the reasons for the downtrend since earnings? Thanks.
"I feel this is about to dump down, wait for the 340s ."
Covid via rant is the issue going forward around the world. It could be another lockdown here. Not going to be good for MA going forward.
Market roaring ahead today but as usual MA getting left behind. Reflects MA is not a true hyper growth stock nor a cyclical stock begetting from inflation embedded in economy. Add in nosebleed valuation and lucky for MA to tread water here.
Options close tomorrow last day of the month. A lot of puts under $370. If it stays under that price it’s going down big time
400 is elusive. Market does not believe MA is worth it.
Will we actually finish green?
going to 400 and way more after earnings. forever stock
Jpm set u up with that overweight then shorted the stock what a con
Target raised to $482!
Up one and a half percent for the year; Whoopie Doo!
"@anonymous Speak for yourself!- I experienced the first “10:1” MA stock split in 2013, and it was my first ever investment — right out of grad school, and I am confident, I will be around for many more splits in MA & V in my lifetime, pal!!!"
"From reading the comments posted on this message board, I realize there are many newbie investors with little experience in equity markets. Regardless of what you post on this message board, it has no effect on the share price. 95% of the volume on big cap stocks such as Mastercard is from institutions. And they do NOT visit message boards to base their trades on. I've been a share holder of MA and V since their respective IPO's.Both are growth stocks, with earnings & profits increasing year after year.Hold on to your shares, you will be rewarded."
"This stock, even though it beats on all levels, is no further ahead than where it should have been a month or more ago! Don’t understand why such a great company does not see gains like it should be seeing... what is holding it down & why??"
"“Travel is returning with a vengeance as airlines struggle to rebuild networks that were ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 50M U.S. airport passengers were registered in May - up 19% from April - and so far in June, the TSA has recorded nearly 35M travelers. But that's causing some disruptions, with carriers and transportation operators struggling to keep up with the ramp up in demand, especially with the lifting of travel restrictions.”— This is awesome news to MA & V longs — as Q2 comes to a close and we approach earnings season!"
Where is Peter???
"43% profit margin and 109% return on shareholder equity, this stock is a no brainer. Sit back and wait for another 10 for 1 split."
Let’s see if we touched bottom today.
Such a phony how much the stock sank in the morning. Hedge funds know and bought on low. Will just go up from here
I mean how low is this going to go? No one can predict the bottom or buy at the bottom but what is the cut off line within reason?
Not very happy with MA stock at the moment. You have to be realistic and the world has changed and I’m scared it will be a long way back to normal like 3-5 years. Maybe never? That would be crazy maybe but the current economic situation is not good for MA. I hold nu tomorrow I will buy Amazon stock and not MA.
Absurd jpm up
How are there trolls on the board for a company the size of Mastercard lol. This company's profits grow year after year and people really trying to scare people out of buying this or visa haha. This stock has consistently outperformed the S&P for the last 15 years and will continue to do so.
why is V green and MA red???
Can't go wrong with this blue chip stock
