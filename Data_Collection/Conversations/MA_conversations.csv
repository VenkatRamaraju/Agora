It’s going up 100%. No way they keep this bad boy down this long that much!! May the longs win!!! May the longs be with you!!!! Forever MA!!!!
MA is on sale at this bargain price levels — a week away from a very positive Earnings report!
"MA’s profits, plus; revenues growth — averaging in the min +25% year over year is a powerful antidote to “HUGE inflation fears”!"
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while MA barley does anything at all."
"This is the only cause I can think of:############################################Tax-loss harvesting is a popular and effective way for investors to minimize capital gains – you sell stocks in the red and use those losses to offset the capital gains and reduce tax bills. You can use losses on ordinary income if you don’t have any gains.But because this particular strategy usually happens at the same time on the calendar — the end of the year for individuals and the end of October for institutional investors — patterns emerge, according to a note from Bank of America (BAC) equity and quant strategy analysts.####################################So for institutions they have deadline of Oct 31st for tax loss selling for mutual funds. MA and V should be big exposures in many mutual funds.The selling could last tomorrow and then reverse next week."
Are we really going red after a great earnings?
"Insider trading at MA in the last few months has been overwhelming sell according to Nasdaq. That is not good. For whatever reason people seem to be acting like they fear the current credit card oligopoly may be collapsing. That is what I fear most. New payment methods are on the rise and investors in MA,V are very concerned."
Any chance the business model of MA goes down every year/bankrupt with all the fintech competition and bit coin going on? What’s everyone’s thoughts on MA and CC”s going forward?
"This move in MA, just feels like LOW going down in sympathy to HD couple months back. MA is going to strongly recover back tomorrow and then some more..."
"Here is what I think is happening; all the big winners overtime like MA, V, TWLO, ROKU and more that has huge gains over the past 1-2 years are being sold off because of this ridiculous idea to tax ""unrealized gains"". So the big guys are positioning to lock in 2021 winners, while resetting basis to avoid Cap Gain Tax on holdings when they buy back after the ""wash rules"" have been satisfied.Thoughts?"
"Recovering back to $340 tomorrow on the Apple, Amazon, and Starbucks sell off."
The Great turnaround in MA could begin in tomorrow’s Market Pre-opening upon release of MA’s “barn burner” Earnings report with solid forward guidance in its “historical strongest Qtr of its Fiscal Year”!
"MasterCard reported Q3 EPS of $2.37, $0.18 better than the analyst estimate of $2.19. Revenue for the quarter came in at $5 billion versus the consensus estimate of $4.95 billion."
"Here's the reason V and MA are down..........--Morgan Stanley Trims Price Target on Visa to $280 From $282 Amid Guidance for Later-Than-Expected Return to International Tourism; Overweight Kept8:50 AM ET, 10/27/2021 - MT Newswires"
I’m at a list for words. It’s a shame to see such a successful company take a beat like MA has over the course of the last 6 months. It’s a total shame. Not sure of MA going forward.
Visa’s nice earnings beat in the AH bodes well and is great news for MA when it reports Thursday morning!!!*** Most important data point from V’s earnings is the significant — 38% rise in cross border spending!!!——- HUGE cross border spending number — signifying travel and hospitality industry is back and strong!!!
it was up 11 dollars in premarket now its down 5 dollars. yikes!
$AXP top expectations +5%. So $V and $MA will do.
"A long holder of V and MA, but their (independent) precipitous movement to the downside has me confused for the first time in years. Clarity?"
MasterCard earnings positive! Do you think this is gonna affect our price today?
"i never got hurt owning mastercard, the company has such a high profit margin and there is plenty of growth left over the next 5 years. i just feel for the shareholders that bought in 2020-2021 it truly is a disappointment and a setback and you guys deserve some returns for holding through this period, my best opinion is hold long term and you'll be up a few hundred percent over the next 5-10 years"
"how can people be happy owning this stock when you can just buy Microsoft or Tesla and 20% in one month. owning a large position, this is just depressing."
Very nice. We should get back all we lost yesterday over the next several days!
All the CC stocks are getting crushed; market is not taking any prisoners in this sector today.
all the markets are up about 20% for the year and this thing is down 7%... what a joke
Are earnings today or in January???PLease help
"All in, this was a solid release from management and one we feel strikes a more positive tone versus the release we got yesterday from peer company Visa. Members will recall, that Visa’s management team indicated that they were seeing cross-border travel rates at around 60% of 2019 levels with the view that it would climb to around 80% by September of 2022, that’s materially behind the 77% level Mastercard management is currently seeing. While shares are still well off their highs, in part due to fears that Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services such as a Affirm are encroaching on Mastercard’s business, we note that Mastercard is not standing by idly and working to leverage its massive global network and build out Mastercard Installments, its own BNPL offering. However, it is important to note that while Mastercard is wading into this space, management is not looking to replicate the business model of other BNPL players by taking on credit risk, instead similar to the traditional credit card business, management simply wants to help merchants and lenders be able to provide the option while collecting a small fees."
"$MA (MasterCard) reports earnings tomorrow, pre-bell. RSI is in favor of a bullish next few days-weeks, and revenue has been spiking in recent quarters. Just bought some calls on the dipPeace, and trade on my friends!"
I bought in two years ago and up only 6.5%. I should have bought TSLA or GOOGL instead. Ugh!
"Stronger net income $2.4b vs $1.5b a year earlier, spurred by domestic and cross-border spending"
"I have owned MA for well over 10 years, and have always added to my position on price dips. I have never sold a share, and have never regretted adding to my relatively large holding. Although I hate to see the price drop today in sympathy for Visa, I will gladly add to my position when/if it hits my price target."
"The payments stocks have all come down, MA, V, PYPL, AXP. They are pulling each other down, despite MA excellent earings report. A big whale is selling."
Mark my wordsWill end up in red today Too bad for V and Ma investors this year will be terrible If you want safe heavens better switch to MSFT or AAPL
A big pullback as V has a negative vibe to investors. So mastercard getting a double whammy with earnings on 28t again? This is so unfair
"Bakkt Holdings Inc $BKKT shares are trading higher Wednesday, reversing after having a very down day Tuesday. Monday the company announced it was working with Mastercard Inc $MA to make it easier for merchants and banks to use and offer a broad set of cryptocurrency solutions and services.I love This Platform https://perfectroi.today/x8gjgn ! This is the most amazing piece of software I have ever used. Totally customizable and incredibly powerful. There is very little I want that it doesn't already have."
"MA & V are being “absurdly oversold!!!*** The winning strategy is to adopt a “selective contrarian investing strategy / tactic” for HUGE gains when the selling volume wanes and abates — because its unsustainable with these two great global businesses of our time!—- Go long and continue to accumulate these cheap stocks, and sit out this irrational confusion, if you can afford to do so!"
"According to 9 analyst offering 12-month price targets in the last 3 months, Mastercard has an average price target of $444.22 with a high of $482.00 and a low of $385.00.MasterCard Inc, a global payments and technology company, is expected to report its third-quarter earnings of $2.19 per share, which represents year-over-year growth of over 36% from $1.60 per share seen in the same period a year ago.The U.S. multinational financial services corporation would post revenue growth of about 30% to around $4.95 billion. The company has exceeded consensus earnings expectations three times in the last four quarters.The company will report earnings on Thursday, October 28 before the market open. The better-than-expected third-quarter earnings results could help the stock recoup recent losses. $MA shares have risen slightly in today's pm session."
"Folks, 1.5% is not exactly a selloff. Calm down and buy the dip..."
Back to 345 next week
When to buy back in - before or after earnings? I think they will kill earnings and won’t guide lower like visa
