"Blackrock owns over 13% of shares, Vanguard 10%. Nice divy. Beat up. I think its a no brainer buy and hold."
Earnings day before the bell tomorrow. Feeling optimistic.
Just got back in this week for my 3rd foray with SNV.. Sold my other shares in Jan. for 35 and doubled my holdings at 15.50. And a great dividend! If I live thru the virus I will spend some money on the grandsons. Best of luck to all.
"All banks remain down through AHs, but someone decides to buy 6,000 SNV shares 6% above where it hovered all day... Ok? Lol AHs action, in general, never makes any sense 99% of the time."
"this is an interesting scenario, would've thought that the exposure to lesser hit areas would have made them more resilient than the larger banks"
"Efficiency ratio of 51.58 for Q2 vs 57.81 for Q1EPS of .57 vs .05 estimateMore loans, more deposits, more revenue than Q1Provision for credit losses of $141.9 million:)))))))"
"Anybody still around from the days of TARP being paid off? This forum was popping back then, and now I see the most recent post is from 2 months ago lol. Was a rough year seeing it nosedive so drastically, but at least it wasn't a company specific drop. Been glad to have held onto this stock for what's creeping close to a decade now. We'll be back to the highs at some point, but for now I stay giddy with a 30 cent dividend on shares originally purchased for ~$1 (pre-split)."
"i bought snv , back when it was going for $ 1.00 , so it has came a long way brother""s , and sister's ,"
This is a screaming BUY at these prices. Should go back up to $25+ in a few weeks. Great earnings and expanding branches. Good pickup at this price.
50.00 is the Buy Point on this merger.
SNV hit a 52wk high today and the dividend is double the 2016 dividend.
Synovus Financial reached a 52 Week high at 39.96
Synovus Financial reached a 52 Week high at 41.73
"Vanguard owns over 10% of the shares and bought almost 900K more in December, 12 million shares held"
"Blackrock owns 11.6 million shares, just buy and hold, it will be back to $50 in a year or two. If they bump the divvy and get some press, sooner."
Looks like a huge beat and positive outlook unless I am missing something
I saw something VERY SUSPICIOUS this morning with SNV stock. After trading up to 19.00 in pre-market trading and finishing at 18.94 minutes before the opening bell it opened at 18.48. Why would someone sell a full 2.5% less than the previous trade unless it was a short trying to manipulate the price? Either way it worked. Despite what might happen on tomorrow's earnings call this stock has a BIG upside in the coming months.
