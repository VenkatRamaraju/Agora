$SNV Target Raised by Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 46 » USD 52
SNV hit a 52wk high today and the dividend is double the 2016 dividend.
This is the deadest board for a stock that is growing as fast as it is. Would be nice if they hiked the dividend though.

"Anybody still around from the days of TARP being paid off? This forum was popping back then, and now I see the most recent post is from 2 months ago lol. Was a rough year seeing it nosedive so drastically, but at least it wasn't a company specific drop. Been glad to have held onto this stock for what's creeping close to a decade now. We'll be back to the highs at some point, but for now I stay giddy with a 30 cent dividend on shares originally purchased for ~$1 (pre-split)."

What is Cyclical Unemployment?https://www.thestockdork.com/what-is-cyclical-unemployment/
This is a screaming BUY at these prices. Should go back up to $25+ in a few weeks. Great earnings and expanding branches. Good pickup at this price.
Just got back in this week for my 3rd foray with SNV.. Sold my other shares in Jan. for 35 and doubled my holdings at 15.50. And a great dividend! If I live thru the virus I will spend some money on the grandsons. Best of luck to all.
Looks like a huge beat and positive outlook unless I am missing something

FCB lawyers show up fast class action suit pay more SNV.
Looks like last week was the buy point.
I am holding until all time high or buyout. Really great dividend too
Synovus Financial reached a 52 Week low at 25.20
Big earnings call today! This should be good for a 20% bump this week
buyout coming?
issue is can this footprint reach $50 again like the fact Vanguard took a big position they should put the sale sign out
Synovus Financial is up 12.85% to 17.30

I am disappointed by the over reaction. Nearly ten percent drop for a relatively good acquisition!
SNV is up 4.93% to $31.74
I saw something VERY SUSPICIOUS this morning with SNV stock. After trading up to 19.00 in pre-market trading and finishing at 18.94 minutes before the opening bell it opened at 18.48. Why would someone sell a full 2.5% less than the previous trade unless it was a short trying to manipulate the price? Either way it worked. Despite what might happen on tomorrow's earnings call this stock has a BIG upside in the coming months.
SNV reached a 52 Week low at $32.68
What's the deal today? getting hit harder than it's peers...
My guess is that it will miss both Earnings report and Guidance tomorrow morning and will tank to $31's. GLTA.
If you are a short term trader that bought at 50.00 today tomorrow sell price is 52.50. Happy Trading
SNV reached a 52 Week low at $33.31
Earnings day before the bell tomorrow. Feeling optimistic.
nice run the past few days
"Obviously FCB shareholders are disappointed with a takeunder bid. SNV reaction to the deal, down 8%, seems a bit overdone. If the deal gets scuttled, back to 55?"
Any ideas whats up today-always tracks other banks - bad whisper??
"Should snuggle to around $25, but then over two, two-and-a-half years, slowly creep back to 50's, be patient!"
SNV reached a new 52 Week Low at $39.24
"All banks remain down through AHs, but someone decides to buy 6,000 SNV shares 6% above where it hovered all day... Ok? Lol AHs action, in general, never makes any sense 99% of the time."
bought this in tarp bank crisis 2013 still own this and other tarp plays...
nees 12s
The big fall in share price is due to the FCB buy out. The board has moved to fast on trying to be the BIG BOYS in the SW regional business. The deal is A BAD one. So who takes the hit? The shareholders who have stayed with them. Lets get this error in judgement fixed soon.Fred
what's up with this stock today?
"this is an interesting scenario, would've thought that the exposure to lesser hit areas would have made them more resilient than the larger banks"
