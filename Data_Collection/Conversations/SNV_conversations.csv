"Vanguard owns over 10% of the shares and bought almost 900K more in December, 12 million shares held"
Management only taking care of themselves. No consideration for the stockholder. It is why they took the company down during the recession and why they are holding back the company now. Selfish PIGS!!

Good day for dead money
buyout coming?

Just saying $SNV has a possible predatory lending problem with their Sea Island bank loan portfolio. Wise choice may be to dump and run. 2017 will be their demise.

Surprised we are not getting a 2 day run. Should not be tied to other underperforming banks. 2 upgrades today. Who is the fool at RBC. Definitely back to 30s coming. A great well run company

The big fall in share price is due to the FCB buy out. The board has moved to fast on trying to be the BIG BOYS in the SW regional business. The deal is A BAD one. So who takes the hit? The shareholders who have stayed with them. Lets get this error in judgement fixed soon.Fred
I saw something VERY SUSPICIOUS this morning with SNV stock. After trading up to 19.00 in pre-market trading and finishing at 18.94 minutes before the opening bell it opened at 18.48. Why would someone sell a full 2.5% less than the previous trade unless it was a short trying to manipulate the price? Either way it worked. Despite what might happen on tomorrow's earnings call this stock has a BIG upside in the coming months.

"Anybody still around from the days of TARP being paid off? This forum was popping back then, and now I see the most recent post is from 2 months ago lol. Was a rough year seeing it nosedive so drastically, but at least it wasn't a company specific drop. Been glad to have held onto this stock for what's creeping close to a decade now. We'll be back to the highs at some point, but for now I stay giddy with a 30 cent dividend on shares originally purchased for ~$1 (pre-split)."
