Five Green Days in a row.
"End of the month the shorts are going all out, this may be their last chance to short at these levels, just be aware."
I'm thinking they will announce dividend during the earnings call on the 27th
Will this go up post pandemic?
"Bought a few more down here @30.13. AFFO PR <85%, yield 8.9%, >20yr. flawless history of paying and increasing dist., even in 2017 when PR reached 118%... Works for me in my early-retired, increasing div paycheck port %^)."
I'm buying more today with >9% fwd. div yield..
"My gut was right someone was shorting this to bring it down prior to earnings, sp was moving down on average volume,looks like its BOA."
Shorts are trying like hell to keep this stock down but earning in seven days with a 8.5% dividend. Good luck with that.
"Jesus christ, dividend investors have the most paper hands out there."
Chief accounting officer just bought 309 shares
Does anybody read or listen to the quarterly conference calls? Management has been warning for two quarters now about revenue shortfalls and the inability for lease holders to make payments. Without government support to cover existing payments they would have been in deep 'S' already. I have been very worried they would cut the dividend but I've owned to many stocks that have maintained the div. in a crisis only to announce a cut at earnings because of deteriorating market conditions. Because I do own shares I don't want this to happen but because of the risk I have trimmed my position a lot. Better safe than sorry in a market like today.

Buying more today. Will hold for the next 30 years. Cheers!
"Dividend of 0.67 just declared, load up boys."
A 9% dividend annualized.
This is the perfect time to scoop shares up - month end reshuffling . all heath REITS are being dumped and will be bought back Monday's. Take your opportunity to add here. IMO
Selling this at a 5 year low and 8.8% div it is very smart. U mast be genius.
"Looks like we are good , great place to park in this overbought market."
Too much winning yet? Seven Green Days in a Row!
"Dividend is remaining at 0.67/share, to be paid on November 15th. Ex-dividend date is Nov. 5th"
"""Buy the fear, sell the greed."" I'll let you decide where we are :)"
Condolences to Cheese Brain and Marvin who sold their shares to me at the bottom.
Approx 10 million shares short interest. If they don't cover in the next 7 trading days then they have to pay the 67 cent dividend. Thats alot of buying volume/day just to cover the shorts closing positions not to mention the buying volume on top of that for the dividend investors. This could get interesting!
Somebody knows something
I feel bullish about OHI. I am down on most of my buys but I feel in the next few months the share price will rise. And I get that that juicy dividend .
Back to reality and the slow climb back to $37.
"Wow, just wow. I was going to wait until earnings but hard not to buy big right now."
Where are all the trolls that were stomping on everybody before they announced the status quo with the dividend? Been very quiet the past 3 days
"Dividend cut unlikely given that fact that Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.81 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items."
"Another possibility for this quarter's dividend is what they did for the 2nd qtr. dividend in 2015, when, I believe a large operator of theirs went bankrupt....they spread the dividend into two payments over April and May. That may be a very real possibility. They were also holding a large security deposit which they retained in bankruptcy court, renegotiated all the prior leases, and were made whole."
Last year OHI announced their 67 cent dividend per share on October 22.
"It is good to see that Chief Financial Officer Stephenson owns 228,877 shares and that two insiders bought shares in August and September. Insoft and Both also own over 328,000 shares."
"Low volume drop, don't be fooled."
"I'm a nobody commenting on a Yahoo finance board, but take it from me...buy companies that are solid financially with good management - and dividends, if that's your thing - and stop watching daily price fluctuations. Also, stop believing every doomsday commenter and even financial columnist. 12 years ago, I bought a share of Berkshire Hathaway at 97 K and sold it shortly after at 99 K, happy that I got out before ""the market collapsed"". Had I been patient and not panicked, well...take a look where that stock went since 2009. Same with Walmart, CME and a few other quality stocks. I've learned my lesson, and I'm not panicking over today's price action."
no cut yea

"No dividend cut, thus I will be adding a lot more at this price."
You got to love it. B of A downgrades OHI after the company announces a dividend of 67 cent per share ( a 9% dividend) and when it is near its 52 week low not when it was near its high of 39.31.Do they have a huge short position that needs to be reinforced with a negative rating?
"I have 1000 of ohi, but should increase to 2000 at this time. recovering to pre-corona price (+50%) plus 9% div. = better than tesla for now."
