You got to love it. B of A downgrades OHI after the company announces a dividend of 67 cent per share ( a 9% dividend) and when it is near its 52 week low not when it was near its high of 39.31.Do they have a huge short position that needs to be reinforced with a negative rating?
"Dividend of 0.67 just declared, load up boys."
Will OHI have to cut the dividend?
1º 30 2º 30/25. Relax.
"Just to inform the newbies on the board. REITS rely on rent payments and OHI collected 99% of them. Why? Because OHI specializes in SNF (skilled nursing facilities), which means the tenants pay via Medicare payments. What is safer than that? Nothing and that is why I am a buyer on any dips."
According to barchart OHI is a strong sell.
Looks like most health care workers are giving in and getting vaccinated
How far does this drop with the next 50% market crash ?I think I'll wait for this to drop back to $13 lol ...
99 % RENT PAYMENTS received and that goes to show you that OHI is solid buy here. The company Focuses on SNF facilities in high demand areas. Government subsidies will continue as Medicare payments continue to flow in.
"As I said earlier I sold all of my OHI shares and added the sale to my PDI holdings that have shown an increase of about $4,500 rather than a loss of around $33,200 this morning had I held on and more income on a monthly basis from the dividend. I never thought I would sell OHI and have learned a lesson never to fall in love with a stock. GLTA."
Cost me $16000 but I bailed on this sorry case.
A 9% dividend annualized.
The covid surge is putting a whole lot of pressure on healthcare reits. I thought the announcement of the booster shot for the older population would have helped sooth some fear of boomers passing before utilizing more healthcare services. Either thats not priced in or expectations are the variant is going to tear through nursing homes and elderly all over again.
"Magavelli, if you watch EPR and O etc, when they drop does OHI."
OHI is done! Will never recover as management is cashing out! This will be below $10 when it’s all said and done. Need better management buy MPW
"It is good to see that Chief Financial Officer Stephenson owns 228,877 shares and that two insiders bought shares in August and September. Insoft and Both also own over 328,000 shares."
"This sale has been great! Bought another 62 shares today at $30.13. Puts me at a total og 830 shares accumulated since March last year, at an average cost of 31.76 (minus dividends earned of course, though I haven't calculated that in)."
I sell shares every day and use it against my gains for tax purposes. It comes in handy to reduce my tax payment BUT OHI is a loser investment and I will never invest in this stock again. The TRUST has been broken and large MM firms are liquidating as we speak. This will continue to go lower as there is too much uncertainty.
Four Green Days in a row!
"No dividend cut, thus I will be adding a lot more at this price."
Looks like bofa must be a big short holder
"When you buy the dips on this baby, you're always rewarded. Ignore the Monday morning quarterbacks and the people that sell on red days. This is a passive income play. Get some!"
Added 500 at $32.60 this morning.
I feel bullish about OHI. I am down on most of my buys but I feel in the next few months the share price will rise. And I get that that juicy dividend .
I'm thinking they will announce dividend during the earnings call on the 27th
Does anybody read or listen to the quarterly conference calls? Management has been warning for two quarters now about revenue shortfalls and the inability for lease holders to make payments. Without government support to cover existing payments they would have been in deep 'S' already. I have been very worried they would cut the dividend but I've owned to many stocks that have maintained the div. in a crisis only to announce a cut at earnings because of deteriorating market conditions. Because I do own shares I don't want this to happen but because of the risk I have trimmed my position a lot. Better safe than sorry in a market like today.
"Omega Announces Increase in Quarterly Common Stock Dividend and Schedules Third Quarter Earnings Release Date and Conference CallOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (OHI) today announced that the Company’s Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend of $0.67 per share, increasing the quarterly common dividend by $0.01 per share over the previous quarter. The common stock dividend is payable Friday, November 15, 2019 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on Thursday, October 31, 2019."
"Bought a few more down here @30.13. AFFO PR <85%, yield 8.9%, >20yr. flawless history of paying and increasing dist., even in 2017 when PR reached 118%... Works for me in my early-retired, increasing div paycheck port %^)."
28 base33 next?37 next?
Something is not kosher here.Bad earnings ? Dividend cut? Change in top management?
4% lower Short seller ?
"If they make their div announcement as they normally do, it would be today. Has anyone heard anything?"
"Incredible that this is trading at these levels with and no fundamentals have changed, this really perplexes me."
"OHI investors please keep in mind that the growth in the U.S. pop. of those 65 and older means more skilled nursing facilities will be needed. One study, by Industry ARC, put the market size of skilled nursing facility care at $298.2 billion in 2020, growing to $520.5 billion by the end of 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% over that period.Omega has raised its quarterly dividend for 17 consecutive years (though not yet this year), and it is currently $0.67 per share, which works out to a yield of 7.28%. No stopping now !"
What happened? They started out so nice.
Bought some more puts yesterday and they are making back what I lost in this po$
Will this go up post pandemic?

Very low volume shorting as usual
"Strange, I bought 8K shares on Friday for retirement income and the stock drops 2% today on no news. Wish I would have waited 1 more day to buy."
"October usually a bad month for stocks. I will keep my dry powder for now, but it won't be to buy any more OHI. I'm down 16% with this dog."
I dont have much info or shares(700ish) was going to drop 30g before div ex date but put it into clsk instead... but my question is what's going on with this stock?is it dropping bc of covid fears or ??? idk. what's ur thoughts
"""Buy the fear, sell the greed."" I'll let you decide where we are :)"
If you have sold on this completely unwarranted dip just stop investing.
Strong Buy!
I’m expecting they’ll look to close the gap at $29.99. I’ll be adding a lot should that happen with no fear about dividend cuts.
I’m buying more.
At some point they will staff facilities but may have to increase pay. Everyone has their price. Pay will go up. Charges to live at the facilities will go up just like what is happening everywhere else. It’s over $10 per person for a fast food meal now
Compraré en 30. Buena empresa.
"Low volume drop, don't be fooled."
I'm waiting to add a little post x date. should fall a dollar or more
I love this stock. Not only am I holding firm but at its bargain price I bought a lot more. Its yield is sweet and juicy.
"To paraphrase Marvin: ""This says it all."" LOL, Brad Thomas on Alpha just took a direct shot at Rida Morwa by entitling his latest article: "" Buy Alert for Omega Healthcare."" He mentions ""Whenever you see sensational headlines like “Crash Alert,” don’t panic and hit the sell button too early. Keep in mind that OHI has been reducing its payout ratio to prepare for the future."""
"I kind of hope they cut it to like .50 and this thing drops to $20. I’ve invested like $6k at a basis of $31 or $32, but I’d love to slug a few more thousand into this. Even with FFO 8% less, that would still be an FFO of .79/.80"
May end down to $22 before a base is reached. OHI has no buyers
I used to post on yahoo under humvee handle having held OHI for over 20 years. Any posters on here from that era The investors on that board was a great group of investors
Last year OHI announced their 67 cent dividend per share on October 22.
"This is just surreal, lol."
Shorts are trying like hell to keep this stock down but earning in seven days with a 8.5% dividend. Good luck with that.
Comical sp movement at this point
Six Green Days in a Row.
the real prob i see with skilled nursing facilities is the labor market. nurses are leaving their regular jobs by the 1000s to become traveling nurses at 90 an hour during the pandemic. this will put considerable pressure on service and revenue something to watch. my wife is in the hospital industry and she sees it hsppening every day
Approx 10 million shares short interest. If they don't cover in the next 7 trading days then they have to pay the 67 cent dividend. Thats alot of buying volume/day just to cover the shorts closing positions not to mention the buying volume on top of that for the dividend investors. This could get interesting!
Somebody knows something
"There are currently no sell recommendations for OHI that I can find, and of 7 analysts covering the stock according to MarketBeat, lowest price target is $33. This suggests even the most pessimistic analyst sees upward potential. I'm a long hold anyway, but just thought I'd remind people about that. Still a rapidly expanding market segment so I remain bullish."
"Looks like we are good , great place to park in this overbought market."
"From the presentation, page 10In addition to the 2 operators previously disclosed, an additional operator, representing approximately 5.4% of our estimated 3Q21 contractual rent and mortgage payments, recently approached us about its current capacity to pay their future rents and interest. This operator did not pay its contractual August rent or interest on other loans outstanding and has indicated that it does not expect to pay September. Omega holds letters of credit, cash deposits, and certain limited personal guarantees that represent approximately $17.6M in the aggregate. We are considering our alternative options. No conclusions have been reached at this time.There will be no write-off of straight-line non-cash revenue as this operator was previously converted to cash-basis accounting. We are currently evaluating its outstanding loans, with a carrying value of approximately $34.3M, for impairment."
"End of the month the shorts are going all out, this may be their last chance to short at these levels, just be aware."
"This says it all. Rida Morwa of Alpha One To Avoid: OHI - Yield 9.0%Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) is a popular choice among retail investors. OHI is an investor in SNFs (Skilled Nursing Facilities). The bulls point towards the ""Silver Tsunami"", the large number of Baby Boomers expected to increase demand for the medical services offered by SNFs. Many have found the story to be compelling.We can see why investors are so enthusiastic. From 2004 through 2017, OHI appeared to be heading for ""Dividend Aristocrat"" status. They were known for making several dividend raises per year. During that period, the share price went from under $10 to trading in the $30's - a stock that provided a high-yield, growing dividend, and share price appreciation. For well over a decade, OHI provided the trifecta for investors.When investing, it is essential to remember that past results do not necessarily reflect future results. Those who drive while looking in the rear-view mirror will be surprised when they crash!The ""Silver Tsunami""What about the Silver Tsunami? Is it going to come and allow OHI to get back on track? Here is a look at SNF beds and occupancy from 2010-2019.Source: OHI September 2021 PresentationNote that the number of beds and the number of facilities has declined since 2010. Despite fewer facilities and beds, the number of patients has fallen faster. Occupancy has declined from 84% to 80%, even though there are fewer beds today than 10 years ago.This is before the negative impact of COVID is factored in, and it is with the backdrop of the 85+ population being 20% higher in 2019 than in 2010. People are getting older, but fewer are going to SNFs.Let's look at where OHI thought they would be today from one of their old presentations:Source: Omega Healthcare March 2017 PresentationWe are now almost through 2021, OHI was projecting occupancies of 90%+ due to the ""Silver Tsunami"". Where is OHI today?Source: OHI September 2021 PresentationThe thesis that a growing elderly population will increase demand for SNFs is busted.Why? Well, one reason is that care at home is becoming increasingly practical and is now something that Medicare and Medicaid will pay for. COVID accelerated something that was already happening, and that is government support for at-home services instead of SNFs. Today, 32 states offer ""Hospital care at home"" programs. These are programs where care providers receive the same reimbursements for treating patients at home as they would in a hospital or SNF setting.More legislation is likely on the way with the Choose Homecare Act making its way through the Senate. One of the largest barriers to receiving homecare has been finances. The wealthy who can afford supplemental insurance or pay cash have opted for homecare over facilities for years. It shouldn't be a surprise that when offered the option, most seniors will choose home. These regulatory reforms, implemented due to COVID, will make it easier for seniors to choose in the future. A large segment of the population that left SNFs is never coming back.This is impacting OHI right now. In the past two months, OHI has had three operators stop paying rent. These operators account for approximately 9% of OHI gross revenues. This is likely just the tip of the iceberg.""EBITDAR Coverage"" is a ratio of earnings before income, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent, divided by rent. OHI has reported EBITDAR coverage of 1.44x, but this includes $453 million in funds from the Cares Act passed in March of 2020. Those funds are not recurring.Source: OHI Q2 2021 SupplementSo far, approximately 9% are not paying rent, which will be reflected in Q3 earnings. We would not be surprised to see the number north of 15% by year-end.OHI has 17 years of dividend increases, but it is heading for a wall this year, and the right thing for management to do would be to cut the dividend significantly.Don't get suckered into OHI's high yield. Drive your investments looking forward!"
Buying more today. Will hold for the next 30 years. Cheers!
I guess those highly margined overzealous Shortsellers from yesterday will be back tomorrow ...Cheers!
"Just rec'd an advisory from Wells Fargo Financial Advisors; WASHINGTON, PRNewswire/ --Maplewood Senior Living and Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI), today announced plans to expand the Inspirbrand to the Washington D.C. market with the acquisition of The Fairfax Embassy Row. The historic hotel will be transformed and re-envisioned into Inspir Embassy Row, an ultra-luxury senior living community that combines the best of residential, hospitality, and healthcare. In the couple of days after this, the stock has plummeted."
"In the last 12 months OHI insiders have bought 22,726 shares and sold 488,574 shares."
This is the perfect time to scoop shares up - month end reshuffling . all heath REITS are being dumped and will be bought back Monday's. Take your opportunity to add here. IMO
"When we had stagflation from 1971-1981, REITs and oil stocks did well."
Looks like we are expanding!
$32 is my target to increase my holdings.
Good to see insider buying. https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/insider/WHITMAN%20BURKE%20W
"Dividend is remaining at 0.67/share, to be paid on November 15th. Ex-dividend date is Nov. 5th"
Selling this at a 5 year low and 8.8% div it is very smart. U mast be genius.
"Greetings All,I currently own MPW but looking to add OHI for additional income. OHI looks like it's dropping in price. Any long term OHI investors have any experience with this holding they are willing to share with me?Thanks in advance and happy investing"
Wow great performance today with s&p 500 all time high lol
"A nice movement up today at OHI to $38.76 (+3.39%) following a suggestive write-up on 12-11-2020 by Tipranks (??), COVID relief bill coming, and vaccine distribution. It was a short article recommending 3 strong stocks yielding 7%+ dividends. I was delighted to see two of these in my portfolio: OHI (skilled nursing and senior housing REIT) and ET (gas pipeline - transfer and storage). OHI has 957 facilities ($10 bil) in 40 states and the UK. I like the stock because of the nice consistent dividend, as well as the long term potential as baby boomers retire in great numbers. I stepped in earlier in the year at about $28/share, so have enjoyed both appreciation in value, as well as a two dividend cycles. I retired in February, so OHI is a long term investment for me (With my share value at $28, the dividend yield on my investment is 9.6%). My initial concerns with OHI was the potential negative impacts on consistent lease payments from the facilities as the pandemic grew. These are elder care facilities after all, and the elderly have been hardest hit by the pandemic, accounting for 37% of the deaths in the U.S. (110k of 300k total). I was relieved later in the year to learn from OHI that well over 90% of their leases are being paid on time. With the release of the vaccine this week, I do not expect consistent facility lease payments to be an issue going forward. It should also be noted that healthcare workers and the elderly will be first in line for the vaccine, as they should be. It's also worth noting that OHI is a well established company, dating back to 1992, so a nearly 30 year record of performance."
Thought I hit the bottom at 33.15...does this stock have a drip plan?...thx in advance...
"LA, once there is proof that those workers at nursing homes are all getting vaccinated than there will not be any more statements of withholding Medicare payments and share price will be heading North once again. This is the main reason for the slide. JMHO, I'm long."
Just announced another customer can’t payOver 5 percent of company business That’s bad Up to over 8 percent now Nowhere to head for aWhile other than down Still a value stock but with the market selling off everyday there are plenty of value stocks hitting the bin everyday nowUnfortunately a real bad timely update See it pressing back to 28 unfortunately
They are playing into the fear. Extended unemployment is almost over and it will now be cost effective to go back to work. The facilities will stay open and continue to pay rent. The residents won’t be put out in the street and there is no other place to go. Common sense says now is the time to load up
"Great just fabulous, no sense drop once again."
"Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) Tops Q3 FFO and Revenue EstimatesZacks Zacks Equity ResearchZacks November 5, 2019Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.76 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.77 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 1.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this health care real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.75 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.77, delivering a surprise of 2.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Omega Healthcare Investors, which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $233.20 million for the quarter ended September 2019, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.38%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $221.85 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Omega Healthcare Investors shares have added about 23.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 22.8%.What's Next for Omega Healthcare Investors?While Omega Healthcare Investors has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Omega Healthcare Investors was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.76 on $236.42 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.03 on $917.65 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."

"I continue to buy into the lovely drop as yields by nature, improve as price drops. I find the following quote useful. Pay attention to the non-automated insider trades to see what insiders are thinking. To my read, they are all in buy, buy, buy mode.https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ohi/insider-activity"
Curious why the dividend hasn’t been declared yet. Hopefully I’m just overthinking this.
"Dividend cut unlikely given that fact that Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.85 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 per share.

I have been a 20 plus year holder of this company It is my largest investment so it is scary to buy more given the shape of the recent chart If I wasn't being conservative I would sell everything else I own and buy just this I used to post in yahoo as humvee5000 Any posters left from the old days
"Ohi, I smell fresh blood. Can you smell it too???"
Just broke short term uptrend and now will head back below $30. Watch your $$
Looks like we are headed under $30 over the next several months. All support has been broken. I will wait patiently before I add.
Three Green Days in a row.
"Have averaged into OHI over the past two years and added more today at 32.05 as part of my dividend growth portfolio. I understand the current staffing problems with the facilities which should be resolved sometime next year. With a ten year outlook I practice patience.My current yield on cost just exceeded ten percent. If OHI, after raising the dividend annually for the last nineteen years, just maintains the current payout and the share price remains where it is now in 2030 the yield will be over 20% by reinvesting each quarter. This is the power of compound interest. Play the long game."
It would be nice if management came out at this point to ease the shareholders
no cut yea
$2400 MONTHLY Unemployment $$ ending this week - OHI should see many eager folks wanting to go back to work now that finally the Free $$ is ending.
"I call it the OHI ""ROLLOVER"".....every day it takes your money at 3:15 and tanks into the close. I can make money just buying at the close and selling at 1:00PM every day. Try it !"
"Another possibility for this quarter's dividend is what they did for the 2nd qtr. dividend in 2015, when, I believe a large operator of theirs went bankrupt....they spread the dividend into two payments over April and May. That may be a very real possibility. They were also holding a large security deposit which they retained in bankruptcy court, renegotiated all the prior leases, and were made whole."
"no div info yet, a little scary."
Have read the posts below. You people just do not see the magnitude of the problem here.
A bit odd they have not announced earnings release and dividend. Can't be good.
I'm buying more today with >9% fwd. div yield..
"Looks like insiders know, NO divi cut boys, buy now or forever hold your peace."
"Relax. I invest for very long time. Today buy in 30,04. Before I bought in 32,8 and 32,2. Dividends."
Chief accounting officer just bought 309 shares
When do we expect the dividend announcement?
"The administration is threatening to cut off Medicare payments to nursing homes who do not vaccinate their staff, hence the sell off. Can’t believe OHI would not mandate this throughout their facilities as dependent as they are on this revenue."
I´m backing up the truck below 33 $ :-)Thank You for these unexpected presentsGreetz from London
Where are all the trolls that were stomping on everybody before they announced the status quo with the dividend? Been very quiet the past 3 days
"where is the bottom here, want to add more shares....thinking mid 30s?"
"Technically, the chart looks very positive in the past 2 trading sessions. Today it opened at previous closing and closed higher with positive net buyers. If the chart holds here expect a slow improvement over each trading day with a gap up as MM's buy before next momentum towards ex dividend dates. GLTA. Bought some more this morning."
This is a falling knife stock. I lost over 10k on it the next kick in the crouch will be the dividend cut. I am so down I can’t sell just watch this nightmare unfold and curse fastgraphs and all you bulls on here that this is a must buy. I only pray for non dividend cut but out look 9% can’t pay his quarter not looking good
Started a position.

"I'm a nobody commenting on a Yahoo finance board, but take it from me...buy companies that are solid financially with good management - and dividends, if that's your thing - and stop watching daily price fluctuations. Also, stop believing every doomsday commenter and even financial columnist. 12 years ago, I bought a share of Berkshire Hathaway at 97 K and sold it shortly after at 99 K, happy that I got out before ""the market collapsed"". Had I been patient and not panicked, well...take a look where that stock went since 2009. Same with Walmart, CME and a few other quality stocks.

"I love dividend stocks XD I'm happy when they go up, because I like the green numbers, and I'm happy when they go down, because I like to buy more on the cheap :D As long as the companies are solid and keep paying dividends, I don't really care about the current stock price, and I don't sweat it if they're cut in half on my portfolio numbers. Before COVID, I was trading, now I'm the most conservative investor ever. And I friggin' love it. Such peace of mind. No stress. Whenever there's extra dough on the account, I go to my portfolio, find one of the currently nineteen companies I'm invested in that's currently the cheapest, and buy more of that. Then I feel great about my future and make a sandwich. Life's good. Peace."
Does OHI ever stabilize and go higher? Or do we just wait until our accounts hit zero?
Anyone who isn't backing up the truck CD shouldn't have a driver's licence
I wonder if OHI owns or operates any of the nursing homes that were shut down in New Orleans?? I'm a 400 share investor
"Hit a limit order @30 on Sep30, and bought a few more @29.96. I hope it stays down or goes below that today, so I can buy more...."
Anyone receive Divy today or am I off schedule?
"Short term is nothing more than a buying opportunity for OHI. Just look at Florida covid cases, down 50% already from peak. That’s what true herd immunity looks like. This will turn around quickly"
Quiet board as OHI tanks...means either no one owns any shares (only institutions) or no one cares about their money or the company.
"I hope OHI has found its bottom, and I've not heard of Dividend cut in last few days, I hope They keep it the same and I will be quite happy with the dividend. holder of 1200 shares @ $32.69"
"Dividends ? You can look for a drop of around %5¢ as soon as now! Dividends are not well covered, profit margins 39.2 vs 23.5% current. Still feeling impact from Genesis failure to pay rents. OHI has loaned them money and took stock - now worthless-delisted. Skilled Nursing Facility occupancies are not even close to pre-pandemic levels. Co-acquisition of Maplewood NY and Wash.DC further increasing debt load when interest rates are going to increase. Computer analytics predict a 47% chance of their going through some form of financial disaster in the next two years. Predictions of a 13-15% drop in stock value in the next 3 mos. A 90% probability of holding between $26.61/29.91 at the end of 3 month period. Predictions of Resistance at $$32.75 and no Support in near future. Trying to average down stock value (I've been trying for a while now) is not working. It is like trying to catch a falling knife. I look to be locked in to loose 12-15% on OHI!"
"My gut was right someone was shorting this to bring it down prior to earnings, sp was moving down on average volume,looks like its BOA."
Everything screams buy on this stock. So why has it been tanking?
Condolences to Cheese Brain and Marvin who sold their shares to me at the bottom.
"Extracted from marketwatch:EPS 2021 1,892022 1,712023 1,82Overweight.Average target price 37.Tecnicaly in this moment is bearish, I m buying for the future."
just read a article on SA that 3rd quarter rents will be down around 9% as some tenants failing to meet their rent obligations.
Five Green Days in a row.
Wow under $30 now. Would love some under $29 but I wont be greedy and may just buy here at $29.92 lol
Noting that the second-quarter payout ratio was roughly 79% of adjusted funds from operations. That's not an outlandish number and suggests there's some wiggle room if the occupancy recovery drags out a little bit. Hopefully OHI will improve on this or at least stay at this level allowing them to continue the dividend.
I’m averaging down today with more bullets in my gun if it drops more. As long as the dividend holds I’m not worried at all and seems bargain priced now
"OHI is a #$%$ and has been going down for 2 months now....each and every day. Its not going back up either as the business is going under with higher costs all around, wage increases and lack of skilled nurses. See you at $10"
The drop doesn't justify the dividend....Sold
Notice in their presentation they show a 7.4 percent dividend return as an attractive part of the investment. Looks like they don’t plan on changing that. I’ll take that while I wait for things to recover back to normal. This is a long term investment for me with quarterly payments
"It is good to see that Chief Financial Officer Stephenson owns 228,877 shares and that two insiders bought shares in August and September. Insoft and Both also own over 328,000 shares. -----9:26 am ET October 8, 2021 Baird analyst Amanda Sweitzer initiates coverage on Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) with a Outperform rating and announces Price Target of $36.----Raymond James analyst Jonathan Hughes maintains Omega Healthcare (NYSE:OHI) with a Outperform . Target price $38.----Consensus among analysts: 4 buys and 5 holds and no sells."
Well as much as I loved OHI I sold all yesterday at a small profit and bought PDI at 25.86 which will earn more dividend wise using all the bucks from the sale. GLTA
I read Rida Mowra's piece and I believe him. We are looking at places here in Florida for my mother in law and they all have so many vacancies.
"$OHI Excellent ER by Omega as expected. highlights:=> Collected 98% of April rents=> Mr. Pickett (CEO) continued, ""While the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 and its potential short-term impact on our operations has yet to be seen, we believe that the attractive elements of this asset class, with its needs-based nature, constrained supply and escalating demand, will remain intact once this pandemic has been resolved.""..Thankfully, the various federal and state agencies that oversee skilled nursing have acted quickly and effectively to provide financial support to the industry...""=> So far, they spent $0 on the stock buybacks from its $200M approved funds (keeping its dry powder intact).OHI reported Adjusted Funds From Operations (""AFFO"" ) of $186.2 million or $0.79 per common share, and Funds Available for Distribution (""FAD"") of $174.3 million -- plenty to safely keep the dividends going and of course they confirmed $0.67/share div for Q2. Congrats to Omega and its investors!PS: I expect a gap up in AH and at least 20% bump in stock price in the next few days..management call in the AM can add more fuel to the fire!"
Back to reality and the slow climb back to $37.
Looks like $30 is the floor
"Management has been buying which leads me to believe no divi cut, unreasonable sell off by all accounts."
"No worries, all reits and big divi stocks down today."
maybe this stabilizes at 28 maybe at 25maybe at 20absolutely disastrous
We all know they’ll raise the dividend. Just a question of by how much.
Brad 'REIT God' Thomas says it's lookin' good ......https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459873-buy-alert-omega-healthcare-investors
What skum is this ?Looks like it will drop below 30.
"Bank of America just downgraded OHI from BUY to Neutral siting staffing issues with SNF's due to vaccine mandate. We view additional support as crucial for OHI tenants,” the analysts concluded. Omega Healthcare's (OHI) price target slashed to $33 from $37 implies a downside of ~1.5% to the last close.Looks like downgrades will continue to take this puppy down....."
collect 10k (=325000$) and get 6700$÷3 monthly. such a nice deal.
"OHI CEO ""Further, we believe 2019 should see a return to the historical acquisition profile of the Company, which should drive growth in FFO as the year progresses.”“As a result of the success of our asset repositioning program, the resolution of the Orianna portfolio, and the expected contribution from the pending acquisition of MedEquities, we currently anticipate maintaining our current quarterly dividend level for the next several quarters with the goal of increasing the dividend in the relatively near future.”"
Mentioned two weeks ago I added more @ $32.05 and bought again today as a long term hold while reinvesting every quarter. Short term pain will eventually subside and the patient investors will be rewarded. The demographics alone point in that direction.
"I have 1000 of ohi, but should increase to 2000 at this time. recovering to pre-corona price (+50%) plus 9% div. = better than tesla for now."
$OHI is one quarter away from being a dividend aristocrat !
So OHI has been increasing their dividend for 18 years but the short sellers on this board are saying they're going to cut it NOW..... LOL. What were they saying in March 2020? Ignore the short sellers and buy this wonderful dip.
"Why does OHI keep falling? I bought 7K shares a month ago as a long term investment for the dividend, but I am just wondering why the price is falling when it is actually a great bargain right now."
"Disgustingly oversold, labor shortage everywhere so why is this getting hit more than others? Seems like shorts have targeted this one hard, its ok more cheap shares for me."
"Jesus christ, dividend investors have the most paper hands out there."
My guess is this plummets on earnings with the revenue problems.
"Sorry guys, I’ve been buying and that’s why it’s dropping."
Another 32 million $$. bites the dust and they say beds have gone south since delta and if thats not bad enough.......the government funding as slowed. Good luck with this one.
"Wow, just wow. I was going to wait until earnings but hard not to buy big right now."
Too much winning yet? Seven Green Days in a Row!
Stock sinking hard.
This company has 18 years of consecutive dividend increases. Well on its way to aristocrat status. Ignore the short sellers get some of that income.
Under $30 soon and then buy it up.
