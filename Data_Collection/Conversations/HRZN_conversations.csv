Top line revenue and Q2 earnings should be positive as well as the 12 month outlook.Buy reco. in place
Everyday HRZN falls I buy more. Nothing like buying panic selling. works everytime.
The company sells a percentage of its own stockshares right? These arenot new shares right?
HRZN reached a 52 Week high at 13.62
"So a near 20% dilution and the stock only goes down 6%, hard to be happy about the haircut but also good to see it hold up well above the dilution rate. That is a VERY positive sign for the long term stock price."
Company needs a press release to address stock price. Some assurance of solvency is appropriate and necessary. Markets experiencing a credit event and this is a credit company.
There is no reason for anyone to sell this stock. Consistent dividend and great earnings. I will be buying more.
so why is the price diving like it is the past couple of days?
"Good upside with this stock over this year and with small number of shares outstanding , reasonable daily stock turnover and really good dividend, this stock is a good one for the portfolio."
Horizon Tech Finance is up 4.94% to 17.00
"If a CEO is buying, That seems like good things coming ! :)"
3 % up on those earnings? What's up?
Something's up and not just the share price. Qtr report coming when...?
I’m buying.
is this an opportunity to buy some shares? 52 Week Range 9.66 - 11.75 it is currently in the middle
Horizon Tech Finance reached a 52 Week high at 13.95
rough day just wish i had some extra powder for this dip
"Ok, I'm no expert, but why is this not a BUY? Revenue is up yoy so are earnings. The EPS covers the payout, with margin I might add, so why is this downgraded. Too many inflections on a graph? Sure BDCs are dicey, but the dividend is already forecast for Q1 '20...anyone, anyone, Bueller?"
"Wow, I wasnt expecting this, Ive been holding HRZN for years, and just added more a few days ago. This uptick is surprising, same thing that hapoened to me with TICC recently when 23 million share buyback and earnings were announced. HRZN is also a good play now as it doesnt seem to get decimated during severe market corrections based on the charts. Steel tariffs, rate hikes, 30% overvaluation of economy, and long term effect of tax cuts all factor in to a significant correction happening soon, Im predicting DOW will fall to 15k to 20k."
"What a wild ride. Held many thousands of shares many years. Out today with a decent profit on top of the wonderful accumulated dividends. I'm not believing the rally, and I think the dividend finally at risk. It's a world of hurt out there. GTL."
I just read through their latest earnings transcript they say the dividend is going to be paid through June very good news they also said they really don’t have real exposed risk from from the Coronavirus they said maybe some of their companies they invest in may have supply parts issues but so far don’t see that as yet. So y so weak today?
They should have done better given the boon in the tech sector. Their 21 cents per share in earnings doesn't even cover the current dividend.
"I bought some of HTFA, there is a helluva yield on these notes. They are kind of like preferred stocks. Anyway, they pass all the 11 rules with flying colorshttps://wantfi.com/preferred-stock-dividend-investing-strategy.html?yhla"
You could not buy 1000 shares at $8.76. Market makers take the ask up after every 100 purchase. Very thinly traded
"I like this BDC because it's profitable, well managed, serving strong growth sectors and pays a nice monthly divided. Happy it PPS has stayed calm allowing me to add on dips. Expect it's share price & yeald to rise substantially once it makes it's way onto the radar of many pension & fund managers."
Watched this for a while. Should have bought in a few days go!
Downgrade is ridiculous. This is a bargain price. The company has a 14.7% yield on its portfolio and the backlog is $45 million. The yield just for the next four months is 3.4%. I see no difficulty maintaining the 10% annual yield.
"woah not liking this pullback, hopefully short lived and just going with the market pullback."
"Hey, make sure you sell your shares because we will be doing an stock offering so sell before we announce it. Im out I don't deal with trash insider rip offs"
is this a monthly payout?
Horizon Tech Finance is up 8.03% to 12.92
good day today on pretty good volume. did not continue down with other techs still correcting. thinking we should be some negatives in the next quarterly earnings report considering all the extra current troubles for start ups in the ongoing covid world. maybe all the stimulus makes it tough to make profits because of tight spreads too. could be a good set up for a sell off that disguises a excellent long term buying opportunity. I'll stay the course either way if they don't cut the dividend.
HRZN is up 8.03% to 12.92
ARE YAHOO'S STOCK PRICES TOTALLY DIVORCED FROM REALITY??
HRZN reached a 52 Week high at $12.24
Great buying opportunity on a big dividend paying company. I always buy into the panic dips and it has mede me money every single time. love it.
Is earnings after hours?
Did everyone get Aug. dividend? I haven’t received. Why?
Horizon Tech Finance reached a 52 Week high at 14.23
"Surge of volume, and initial dip in price, suggests some news, but the only thing I see is a report on changes in investments, but what detail of that report caused the excitement?"
HRZN reached a 52 Week high at 12.98
Will buy on next dip. Look to bottom at low $10 range. Than will shoot back up after next quarter earnings. IMHO
Whoa. Was there some news i missed to drive this up so fast?
Got crushed today.
Overall bullish on HRZN. Love the recovery that they have had since the beginning of COVID and the consistent dividend payout. Would love to see the stock break above 18.05.
Terrific year ending results report and good portfolio of loans plus special capital distribution of .05. This looks good for the next year.
All of the BDCs are down because BDCL has been forced to liquidate.
Looks like we’re in the soup……..x div or not !
Y is hrzn so weak today when the market is up a lot today?
HRZN reached a 52 Week high at 12.72
"Besides two down short spikes, this is the low for two years. After reading: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/horizon-technology-finance-provides-investment-201500786.html from Oct. 10,18, couldn't resist picking up more."
Timing is abysmal. They should reconsider. Already well below the offering price. I don't think it will fly.
ouch. well divy still intact so i'll but the dip
"Horizon Technology Finance prices underwritten public offering of 2,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $12.14 per share for total gross proceeds of approximately $24,280,0008:17 AM ET 3/22/19 | Briefing.com"
Horizon Technology Finance is down 4.93% to 16.97
When/If AMC squeezes I’ll be piling in on this one.Love the price with a dividend.
"whats going on, why the pull back to under $13.00?"
Horizon Tech Finance is down 5.26% to 11.71
"This is a BUY right now. Not based on last Q's performance which missed estimates and NII didn't cover the dividend. But it's a BUY based on a record $73M of originations in Q4 which will generate increased NII in Q1-18 and going forward. Enough to cover the dividend? Perhaps, but we should be close and $0.09 of spillover income will cover the minimal shortfall. Buy!"
Price appreciation and 10.5% dividend. Have a few thousand shares. Should have bought a lot more!

"What's wrong with a yield of 9.8% with a guaranteed 10 cents per share in December, January, and February and probably for the the rest of 2021. Meanwhile, your money market fund is paying and average of .21% and the ten year treasury is paying .87%."
"Horizon beat the numbers. Expectation was .41 and it came in at .46, plus we're getting an extra .05 in April. I also like their portfolio. Of the stocks i own, this is the best."
Great day. Confidence in management of HRZN was justified.
HRZN is up 4.95% to $11.88
"33% increase in earned income from last quarter. NAV more than 10% above stock price.Annual dividend annualized stands at 11.9%+++From Robert D. Pomeroy, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon:""During the first quarter, we continued to generate strong yields and solid net investment income. Following a fourth quarter of record loan originations, we remain focused in 2018 on rebuilding our investment pipeline of quality opportunities and managing our portfolio. With the majority of our portfolio comprised of more recent vintage transactions, we believe we are positioned to generate a predictable income stream. In addition, with the recent renewal of our credit facility, we are also positioned to selectively capitalize on compelling venture lending opportunities and to continue to create opportunities for long-term shareholder value."""
Horizon Tech Finance is down 4.99% to 16.54
Is this stock to thinly traded ?
15 months of dividends gone in one day.
This latest news has me thinking of shifting some from another REIT here. HRZN is looking very good.
Looking to buy this stock. Is it too pricey now
Can't wait to see the faces of the Markets Arthritic Hands when the Trade Pact goes off W/O a hitch and they can't back in to the stocks they sold today....GET USED TO YOUR NEW HOME!
I bought this stock on Jan 16 and did not receive a dividend for Jan 16 or Feb 16 and I don't understand why.
"13.75 -13 9o will be the resistance ceiling for HRZN, but the good fundamentals and quality dividend make it a hold stock or buy more if it drops below 12 in the next few months."
HRZN is up 4.99% to 10.87
buy the dip if you can !
It hard to invest when everyone thinks a virus will end life as we know it on the planet
Everything in the report looked great to me!
"Bought some more with these ""after EX date"" down turns. So far so good!"
"Nice to know that HRZN will be paying dividends for the next for months equaling 4,3% dividend on today's closing price. Additionally, the company has a compelling portfolio of development-stage technology companies in emerging technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, and sustainability industries."
Owned these shares for years. Never seen this kind of move before.
Recently loaded up on quite a few of these. Next dividend due in October
Want to buy more with some cash I have but I have to wait for price to come down. It is too high right now. Then again it could go to 20 lol
"Next three months dividends of 10 cents a share guaranteed (2.5%) Earnings were excellent. Meanwhile, 10 year T notes yield .64 %."
If i bought the stock march 12th when would the first divi payout be anyone know please?
picked shares today at 11.55 and couldn't be happier. If it stays below 12 will buy even more tomorrow. always chase stocks on sale during panic selling.
Is ex-dividend day Tues? So if i buy in today i get the dividend or can i buy Monday and get it still?
"Stared at the $15+ price range thinking sell what I have in a ROTH. Gain would equate to years of of divs. Then buy it, or more, back when there's a dip, which came sooner than I expected."
Take a look at HRZN's 1 yr chart - very impressive.
Horizon Tech Finance reached a 52 Week high at 14.57
"With outstanding shares at 11.53M adding 2M, shouldn't be such a big deal. Now, if they had 200M outstanding and were adding 10M shares I'd be more concerned. I'm more concerned at the prospect of recession."
4 months of dividends assured 10...10...10...10 cents May-August.
Zack is not bullish on this earning call today.... Are they wrong again? Anybody out there?
"Nice jump. My other dividend payer also had a similar jump. Something new with ""spread"" or just anticipation of a good report?"
Horizon Tech Finance is down 5.58% to 11.17
"looks kinda stagnant, what's the appeal to this stock?"
"Purchased 2,000 shares at $7 on 3/20/20 and could not be happier! Reinvesting the dividend too........"
Safe dividend investment here
HRZN is down 5.32% to $10.68
"glad I got out today. It was way overbought! Next thing you know they'll issue new shares like they did last time, the price just sank big time! Not doing that again!"
"I’m here for the monthly dividend and don’t care about sp. Stocks trade up and down, the good thing is this company beat 3 out of 4 quarter reports last year. Buy all the dips you can eventually this will be above $15"
"Why is dividend date not set by yahoo,someone who knows in US"
"Update today didn't imply company is under any stress whatsoever. Very reassuring, I thought."
"Italy's economy gets a shake and the market over-reacts - as usual. This is why i like REIT's. They aren't dependent on Italy, China or England -only on American buyers and renters of homes and businesses. As long as HRZN and a few other REIT's i own are well managed, I will continue building shares through dividends. So far so good."
Is everyone done panicking yet?
"If HRZN ever hits 20, I'd like to see one of two things: 1) With Shares outstanding @ 19.66m, Stock split 2 for 1, because at 10, it likely wouldn't take more than a month before moving up a dollar or three. 2) Raise the dividend to .11 or .12."
What does everyone think about this one? Seems like a nice stable yield!
HRZN is up 5.04% to 11.88
Not really liking the stock going down today right before earnings. It already seems undervalued. Any thoughts?
Is the ex-dividend date July 19th ?
"Couldnt ask for a better report, Great job Hrzn !"
Low risk with nice dividend and upside share growth. BUY
"We are bullish in the long term on this company. We have our average holding around 9.80/share. Earnings was disappointing, but we believe the company has good fundamentals and good management. We are safe with the company as long as its price stays above $12. We believe that adding on the dip is a good play for most investors. Our goal is to hold for the long and sell the stock around 16/share which we were very close to."
Anyone have any thoughts on why this is dropping so much each of the last 3 days?
I've held these shares for years. By far the biggest earnings numbers I've seen. A great total return vehicle.
HRZN will most likely be paying 10 cents a share for the next 12 months. That is over 9%. 30-year T bonds are paying 1.4%. And the dividends come in every month.
One suspects that they might raise the monthly dividend.
"If HRZN goes up...Great, if it goes down and you are using DRIP, Great again because you are buying shares at a discount"
Sold on the spike. Only bought this for the div. Made about five years worth of dividends on this. Will look at it when it takes a breather again.
"CEO's of all my 3 dividend stocks are buying large amounts of shares. Whenever the panic runs out, shares will be worth just that much more."
no dividend showing today?
Horizon Tech Finance is up 4.95% to 12.50
"As long as these dividends hold (they are promised for 3 more months) I'm holding HRZN and 2 other high paying dividend stocks, saving the divies so i can pay my way through the panic attack. Not going on margin, but hoping to build up capital quick enough to buy more before these recession prices are gone."
"Why the beat down today? I thought with the fair ER and dividends, we'd be OK."
will this awfully nice run up continue or will this pullback? im happy where I'm at just looking to see what everyone's thoughts are
What happened at 2pm today to Horizon Technology Finance Corp (HRZN)?
"Statement from one in Horizon's portfolio - Vero Biotech...""March 26, 2020 – VERO Biotech LLC, an Atlanta, Georgia-based biotechnology company focused on saving lives, alleviating suffering, and improving the health economics of care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted “expanded access emergency use” allowing its proprietary inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) delivery system, GENOSYL DS, to immediately be used for the treatment of cardiopulmonary symptoms associated with COVID-19. GENOSYL""(nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and is the only tankless inhaled nitric oxide device available in the US.""I see a lot of healthcare companies in their portfolio I imagine HRZN should be weathering this virus well."
"Steady dividend payer through even these bad times. Unlike some other companies, they are keeping the monthly dividends instead of going quarterly - I like that. I will be buying more HRZN at these relatively low prices."
hrzn will go to 10
HRZN is up 5.32% to 10.89
Seems like a bit of an overreaction.
It's nice to get paid these regular & special dividends with HRZN while the market tanks. HRZN stock value was also rising nicely before the virus panic. Will be buying more HRZN in the future!
"If the SEC was not ineffective, it would investigate the leak. Somebody spelled the beans about the dilution."
What is the date you received the Feb 16 dividend?
Looking good! excellent core holding. Great management and biz model! just love the growing strength and momentum here. Hopeing they can keep the yeald near10% as share price grows.
"Usual activity: Sharp sell off yesterday, strong bounce back today. high volume both days. Still holding but wondering...."
"Of the 3 dividend stocks i hold, I've held HRZN the longest - over 2 years. All pay at least 9% monthly. I do not sell and I reinvest the dividend about 60- 70% of the time. HRZN could fall below my initial buy and counting all the dividends I've received, i'd still be well ahead. If you are holding for capital gain, you're in the wrong stock. If you're here for the dividend, I don't know how you could do much better than the current 9%+."
HRZN reached a 52 Week low at 11.38
Tax plan(2018) will help earnings but will hurt ??????. Higher interest rates will help short term(12-18 Months) will help earnings -long term not. Any input??
I assume today's action indicates a credit market freak out. a little worrisome.
What is the deal here? Did I miss an announcement? Are they cutting dividends or something?
Progressive div reduction over the past 6 years...............why ?
Good numbers today.
"Insiders are holding tight. I see no sales. They have annouced the dividends for September,October,and November. I suspect their future earnings will be fine. I suspect a dividend increase."
Horizon Tech Finance is down 5.35% to 12.57
compelled to sell at 17.50I'm out for now
Hoping for a good earnings report and a good update. GLTA
Horizon Technology Finance is up 4.95% to 17.80
Buying under $13
"Bought some more on the dip! Yay-hoo for moi. HRZN announces dividend for Apr, May & June. Lookin' good. Feelin' good."
any news for this nice run up?
Castle Creek BioSciences announces $75M loan from HRZN for advancement of gene candidates for rare diseases.
HRZN is down 4.92% to $11.40
"Added 100 shares on Friday. That's how freaked out I was. Just 100 shares. I own plenty, so a big sigh of relief today. While it lasts."
Does this dip much? Want to get in but would like to about $12 pps. Will I get that chance or not?
"While not a great fan of Zacks, they do have a nice piece on HRZN https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-horizon-technology-155003796.html"
looks like we will be flirting with $17 again very soon.
It looks like estimated earnings were beat across the board.
"Been holding this stock for a while. I've never seen this kind of crazy price action. Growing their earnings, book value and covering the dividend. Pretty solid."
"Shares outstanding 11.54m. That's way low. If that's right, a stock split in the near future? Or is this company buying back?"
I understand the big jump in HRZN at the end of the year being many folks are selling value stocks without high dividends and buying value stocks such as HRZN with solid high dividend returns. I love HRZN as an investment and will not sell even with this tremendous upward tick since I bought it for it's high dividend paid out monthly.
HRZN reached a 52 Week low at 10.80
Didn't see this coming.
I've owned this stock for years. nearly a 10% yield. buy it and forget about it and just reinvest the dividends. long-term play
Where do you get a 10% dividend and price appreciation? This is the only one I know of.
HRZN owns warrants in many start up enterprises. Perhaps hit the jackpot with one? Interested to see whether these gains stick.
HRZN is up 5.17% to 11.40
A rare opportunity to invest in a solid growth story at value prices. Still 40% off the pre sell off price from February. Pays a solid distribution yield and this is a growth company that invests in growing tech and life science companies. Selling below book value. Just hold for a year or so and ride it back up or hold for the long term and build your shares by reinvesting your distributions.
Putting that new capital right to work. I'm thinking the secondary offering may turn out to be rewarding in the long term.
Bought some more. Love this monthly dividend stock.
"On the basis of the update I think I'll increase my position. Expect another leg down in the market. That will present an even better opportunity, IMO."
"RSI warning from BOA: ""The Relative Strength Index for HRZN closed either above 70 or below 30, which indicates that it is overbought or oversold.""Which one is it? I cannot tell.... The volume reeks..... Anybody with any worthwhile thoughts on this? TY...."
Offering should close today. I hope we can resume our grind higher.
nice gain we are getting today. will it hold or will it pull back before divvy date?
"My thoughts exactly. HRZN, since the SBA money is not going(at this point) the disti should be safe-maybe... but who knows if the monies will be released in time."
I didnt want to leave but my situation said I have to
"Horizon is well-positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. As of the first quarter of 2017, floating rate loans comprised 100% of Horizon’s outstanding loan portfolio, up from 96% at the end of 2016.This means Horizon has leveraged itself to a rising-rate environment. The company states that for every 100-basis point increase in LIBOR, it would see annual net interest income increase by approximately $0.07 per share."
Glad to at least see some stability here. These are extraordinary and difficult times.
I believe this pulled back because it crossed above the 200 day moving average the day before. Probably programmatic trade.
"Horizon Technology Finance (HRZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.40 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items."
"Yesterdays market pullback was a nice time to begin a small position into the company. With dollar cost averaging and DRIP programs, you can create yourself a sizable position in no time, while earning passive income for your portfolio.Analysts are indicating that HRZN should meet earnings expectations. If that's the case, its another easy 30cent dividend payout for the the next three months (10cent/month).SP may struggle to beat 18/share though so the range we are currently in (given external factors like COVID, Inflation numbers, and sectorial rotations), may continue until late into the fall."
I'm holding the HRZN shares I currently own and will be buying much more if ever dips back below 12. That may not happen but will keep some powder dry if it ever does.
HRZN is down -5.10% to 10.41
HRZN is up around where it's been the past 3 years. (Over bought?) Probably due to adding a few health sector companies and because it's paying dividends. I'm in the profit zone here but don't think I'm going to sell as long as the dividends keep coming which help keep me in the black and allow me to buy a few more shares thus increasing my return.
way oversold
Horizon Tech Finance is down 5.08% to 12.70
"I'm new to the dividend game. Can any of you help me with a question. On a monthly pay dividend, exp $100 of stock with a $0.10 a share dividend. You could be paid $10.00 a month on this. I ask because it seems to good to be true?"
Upgraded by Research Team from hold to accumulate
HRZN is down 5.35% to 12.57
why is this falling so much in after hours today
HRZN is down -5.80% to 10.40
Why didn’t I load up big at $5?
Someone is very interested

Reminder... dont lose your dividend AND special dividend by panic selling
great AH news on MBIO...just received all those warrants ......
