"If HRZN ever hits 20, I'd like to see one of two things: 1) With Shares outstanding @ 19.66m, Stock split 2 for 1, because at 10, it likely wouldn't take more than a month before moving up a dollar or three. 2) Raise the dividend to .11 or .12."
"Next three months dividends of 10 cents a share guaranteed (2.5%) Earnings were excellent. Meanwhile, 10 year T notes yield .64 %."
"What's wrong with a yield of 9.8% with a guaranteed 10 cents per share in December, January, and February and probably for the the rest of 2021. Meanwhile, your money market fund is paying and average of .21% and the ten year treasury is paying .87%."
"Ok, I'm no expert, but why is this not a BUY? Revenue is up yoy so are earnings. The EPS covers the payout, with margin I might add, so why is this downgraded. Too many inflections on a graph? Sure BDCs are dicey, but the dividend is already forecast for Q1 '20...anyone, anyone, Bueller?"
It's nice to get paid these regular & special dividends with HRZN while the market tanks. HRZN stock value was also rising nicely before the virus panic. Will be buying more HRZN in the future!
"Bought some more with these ""after EX date"" down turns. So far so good!"
Low risk with nice dividend and upside share growth. BUY
4 months of dividends assured 10...10...10...10 cents May-August.
Upgraded by Research Team from hold to accumulate
"Nice to know that HRZN will be paying dividends for the next for months equaling 4,3% dividend on today's closing price. Additionally, the company has a compelling portfolio of development-stage technology companies in emerging technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, and sustainability industries."
Bought some more. Love this monthly dividend stock.
"Awesome results as usual and a special divy, gotta love that."
I've held these shares for years. By far the biggest earnings numbers I've seen. A great total return vehicle.
will this awfully nice run up continue or will this pullback? im happy where I'm at just looking to see what everyone's thoughts are
"looks kinda stagnant, what's the appeal to this stock?"
why is this falling so much in after hours today
"Update today didn't imply company is under any stress whatsoever. Very reassuring, I thought."
I understand the big jump in HRZN at the end of the year being many folks are selling value stocks without high dividends and buying value stocks such as HRZN with solid high dividend returns. I love HRZN as an investment and will not sell even with this tremendous upward tick since I bought it for it's high dividend paid out monthly.
"Purchased 2,000 shares at $7 on 3/20/20 and could not be happier! Reinvesting the dividend too........"
"Insiders are holding tight. I see no sales. They have annouced the dividends for September,October,and November. I suspect their future earnings will be fine. I suspect a dividend increase."
"Statement from one in Horizon's portfolio - Vero Biotech...""March 26, 2020 – VERO Biotech LLC, an Atlanta, Georgia-based biotechnology company focused on saving lives, alleviating suffering, and improving the health economics of care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted “expanded access emergency use” allowing its proprietary inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) delivery system, GENOSYL DS, to immediately be used for the treatment of cardiopulmonary symptoms associated with COVID-19. GENOSYL""(nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and is the only tankless inhaled nitric oxide device available in the US.""I see a lot of healthcare companies in their portfolio I imagine HRZN should be weathering this virus well."
"Horizon beat the numbers. Expectation was .41 and it came in at .46, plus we're getting an extra .05 in April. I also like their portfolio. Of the stocks i own, this is the best."
rough day just wish i had some extra powder for this dip
A rare opportunity to invest in a solid growth story at value prices. Still 40% off the pre sell off price from February. Pays a solid distribution yield and this is a growth company that invests in growing tech and life science companies. Selling below book value. Just hold for a year or so and ride it back up or hold for the long term and build your shares by reinvesting your distributions.
Great buying opportunity on a big dividend paying company. I always buy into the panic dips and it has mede me money every single time. love it.
"This is a BUY right now. Not based on last Q's performance which missed estimates and NII didn't cover the dividend. But it's a BUY based on a record $73M of originations in Q4 which will generate increased NII in Q1-18 and going forward. Enough to cover the dividend? Perhaps, but we should be close and $0.09 of spillover income will cover the minimal shortfall. Buy!"
"Steady dividend payer through even these bad times. Unlike some other companies, they are keeping the monthly dividends instead of going quarterly - I like that. I will be buying more HRZN at these relatively low prices."
"As a general rule, does HRZN issue a special year end dividend?"
"Stared at the $15+ price range thinking sell what I have in a ROTH. Gain would equate to years of of divs. Then buy it, or more, back when there's a dip, which came sooner than I expected."
"I'm new to the dividend game. Can any of you help me with a question. On a monthly pay dividend, exp $100 of stock with a $0.10 a share dividend. You could be paid $10.00 a month on this. I ask because it seems to good to be true?"
"As long as these dividends hold (they are promised for 3 more months) I'm holding HRZN and 2 other high paying dividend stocks, saving the divies so i can pay my way through the panic attack. Not going on margin, but hoping to build up capital quick enough to buy more before these recession prices are gone."
I've owned this stock for years. nearly a 10% yield. buy it and forget about it and just reinvest the dividends. long-term play
"I like this BDC because it's profitable, well managed, serving strong growth sectors and pays a nice monthly divided. Happy it PPS has stayed calm allowing me to add on dips. Expect it's share price & yeald to rise substantially once it makes it's way onto the radar of many pension & fund managers."
Great day. Confidence in management of HRZN was justified.
"Italy's economy gets a shake and the market over-reacts - as usual. This is why i like REIT's. They aren't dependent on Italy, China or England -only on American buyers and renters of homes and businesses. As long as HRZN and a few other REIT's i own are well managed, I will continue building shares through dividends. So far so good."
Looking good! excellent core holding. Great management and biz model! just love the growing strength and momentum here. Hopeing they can keep the yeald near10% as share price grows.
HRZN is up around where it's been the past 3 years. (Over bought?) Probably due to adding a few health sector companies and because it's paying dividends. I'm in the profit zone here but don't think I'm going to sell as long as the dividends keep coming which help keep me in the black and allow me to buy a few more shares thus increasing my return.
Overall bullish on HRZN. Love the recovery that they have had since the beginning of COVID and the consistent dividend payout. Would love to see the stock break above 18.05.
There is no reason for anyone to sell this stock. Consistent dividend and great earnings. I will be buying more.
"I’m here for the monthly dividend and don’t care about sp. Stocks trade up and down, the good thing is this company beat 3 out of 4 quarter reports last year. Buy all the dips you can eventually this will be above $15"
