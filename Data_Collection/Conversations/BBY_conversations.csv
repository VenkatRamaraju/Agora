BBY has an amazing dividend and we are already on the low end of the share price wooohooooo LOADING UP
"Dude, I just bought 2000 shares at 112.48!!! excited for earnings. I know a few people over at BBY and they are SWAMPED"
So is this the result of the stellar report and the upgrade? What was all the hype about?
Boxing Day Sale for this Stock.
Whenever you see the bubble posts you know the stock is going to FLY HIGH
"I do not follow this stock, but I have spent tens of thousands of dollars with Best Buy. Two of the printers I have purchased over the past 14 months just died and I went back to replace them. I could not replace either one as they are out of stock and the store cannot offer a timeline as to when they may be in stock. The good news is there is plenty of demand. The bad news is there is nothing to sell and on top of that the “salespeople”, if you can find one, appear to care less. This was pretty spread across several items including cameras, laptops and PC’s. I realize this is not new news, but if there is no “stock” how can they maintain there stock price."
"Loaded another 500 shares, my H/F says BBY is going over 125.00 tomorrow and then with holidays this is a no brainer especially because BBY was pulled back in the last week"

Macy is redeeming 1.3B of debt due 2025 ahead of scheduled and will realize an interest savings of about 120M per year. This translates into an EPS increase of .384 cents that wasn't previously factored into guidance. Give that a multiple of 8.5 PE and you get 3.27 increase in share value just due to this savings. M CFO also said by the end of the year the leverage ratio will be low enough that M will be considered investment grade! M must be doing much better than expected! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-retires-debt-ahead-schedule-234915266.html
Stock dives at the end of the day. I would be willing to bet earnings has already been leaked out.
I heard about BBY the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Remember whisper numbers!
