"BB is expanding partnerships, cutting costs, bringing forth new products and employing many new innovations. They also have raised guidance. Looks good!"
Best Buy is a great store. profits!
got myself 500 shares @ 115. Looking forward to exviting earnings in Mar for BBY
"Bought a high end modem from BBY. Free next day delivery, Amazon not available till mid September , same price. BBY is eating Amazons lunch."
"Been charging up the bby credit card ,new x-box ,ect .. support the stock you own!!"
Unreal! Could be strong hands pushing this down to buy. Hopefully. It’s the guidance that spooked investors but most companies seem to do that a great deal due to potential litigation. But this seems way over done. Even if sales slow some still very good earnings. Come on buyers.
"Very unusual for me to short a stock but seems obvious that store closures and supply issues are not a reason to see all time highs. I shorted 1500 shares @ $85.25, I am almost always wrong so I like your chances if you disagree."
Watch this carefully for the recovery. I stopped out at 115 but this is one of my favorite stocks when it soars. It is ridiculously undervalued but you can't try to catch a falling knife. Wait for a confirmed up signal and buy and enjoy the ride. Then don't forget to take profits!
Best Buy will soar! Digital goods are getting a lot of excitement with so many new releases.
I still don’t understand why this is down 20% since crushing earnings. Buying as much as I can.
Why is BBY down $1+ today after just being upgraded by BAC to $157 ???
This is still the only store I see that constantly has a line up... I think when they release the christmas numbers we will see a strong push !
BEST BUY IS THE ONLY PLACE TO GET ELECTRONICS? ....KEEP BUYING....NO WAY TO LOOSE IF EVERYONE KEEP BUYING.....PLEASE BUY BUY BUY.....IM SURE WE WILL GET AN UPGRADE SOON THAT WILL HELP KEEP THIS STOCK PUMPED.....CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON STARTS IN ABOUT 270 DAYS.....BUY BUY BUY
Looking forward everyone will need more laptops for schools and college and Xmas shopping will be huge I see 150 price target
"Yep BBY was pulled back now comes the BULL RUN, over 115.00 before earning s and over 125.00 after earnings"
"I am all over this.Management is often cautious about their predictions, then typically does a big beat. This is a solid opportunity."
"Honestly, given the downgrade this is the most fight I've seen out of this stock in the last 4 weeks. Wouldn't be surprised to see this thing go green by end of day."
"On Robinhood . In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."
Very odd bby has one of the lowest pe amongst the big stores. Very undervalued
"Best Buy (BBY) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices"
Let the stock find its footing ....I think we hit that floor this afternoon. I always wait three days to buy more after a sharp fall. Great stock ....no worries.
"This stock is going to the moon, the curbside experience was absolutely perfect, I will be purchasing all my electronic needs only from here. I just wish I had gotten in on the stock, the virus was a positive.game changer for this company"
BBY partnership will put LOVE at 80 per share. Expecting more news on December 9th earnings and new products. Going to be huge
Boxing Day Sale for this Stock.
"BUY THE DIPBest Buy’s same-store sales grew by 23% and its online sales in the U.S. grew by 174% in the third quarter.Despite its strong performance, the retailer declined to provide an outlook due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic.Customers have shopped at the big-box retailer for everything from kitchen appliances to laptops during the coronavirus pandemic.“The current environment has underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology, and the capabilities we are flexing and strengthening now will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy,” CEO Corie Barry said."
Every year this stock does the same ...we need patients here.
Smashed EARNINGS
RSI shows BBY is oversold. Back up to 75 by friday. Print that
"Be very careful buying into this rally - Just like the Flu, Symptoms can be masked by pain killer drugs (i.e. 2 trillion dollar stimulus package)."
So is this the result of the stellar report and the upgrade? What was all the hype about?
Remember whisper numbers!
I will see today positive If u can't wait a month don't buy I am betting around 102 is bottom
time to buy
"A lot of people do not understand BBY business model - it's not just about selling the latest I-Phone (in fact all Apple products account for 10 percent of sales with the latest I-phone just a small percentage of that). The area that is rapidly expanding is:The company launched its Assured Living service last year, which helps people check on older individuals’ health and safety. With annual revenues of over $300 million and more than 900,000 paying subscribers, the GreatCall acquisition is in line with Best Buy’s 2020 strategy."
"This company has top class fundamentals, in the long term this stock will continue to go up and up."
Record Black Friday online sales. This should move up big on Monday.
"Looks like ""Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold on Wednesday."" has got it right. One of the few analyst that can see beyond the noise and understand the amazing potential BBY has."
"Investors actions to short stocks and manipulate it so much as they've been doing lately will push publically traded companies to buy back their stocks and never sell a share again ( China is realizing this problem and started the buy back already, take QD for example). Now I see why Musk was so desperate to take Tesla private, I am assuming this will be happening a lot in the coming years with so many companies, mark my word."
the demand for quick electronics is going to explode and guess who has the best buying power to stock up locally
"I want to be bullish and I even have long calls on this but I only see this getting worse before it gets better. We might be back at 100 tomorrow. It gapped up today and crossed the daily STO 20 mark and still fell like a rock when most of the market was positive in light of the relief coming there was no positive here. We broke through every 5 min SMA I had on it, 50,75,200, and it hugged 300 before it finally just gave up and kept falling. I don't know this will recover but it will take more than a stimulus to change it. If you watch this stock it follows treadlines to the T, almost too perfectly..."
It will bounce back!!!
"“Job losses of this scale are unprecedented. The total number of job losses for the month of April alone was more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute."
"We have been loyal customer's for YEAR'S. We lived in Wisconsin & Iowa (Dubuque) before retiring to The Village's Florida 9 years past. Our BB store is in Lady Lake Florida (lots of Senior's). We have NEVER had one problem with BB and it's product's, warranties, selection, best price on T.V.'s & appliance's, Geek Squad (they put cover's on their shoe's entering our modest home), in-person help, telephone call back's happen very soon rather than later, they call us Sir & Mam, everything we need is right there (printer help, cartridges, drop repair, etc. ) BB is #1 with us. Does Costco or Amazon visit your home? Do Walmart employee's (mostly H.S.) appreciate your $$? We are very happy with BB. The stock is cheap (and with dividends)Wait until 2019 and this stock goes way up. Remember Chauncy Gardner (Being There)? The movie. Spring, summer, fall, winter. The cycle's. Don't sell all you young people."
Settling down as the short term minded sellers get out in a day or two. Will be moving up to 85 + in a few days.
"It was up a whopping 50 cents and by the time I started typing, it is down 5 cents. Can't even hold a $50 cent gain"
The sharp increase in share price today likely some short covering. Now what makes it very interesting - A lot of big funds (especially retail related funds) will be buying over the next few weeks - This stock is among the top/cheapest for retailers so would not hold my breath for a much lower price to buy.
No hurry to buy! Will fall sharply in afternoon closing
"Just bought another thousand shares to add to my bank, I predict price of $125.00 very soon."
"Stock was up when most of the market has been average or down in the last 6 months...This is standard correction and EXPECTED. What did people expect, a retail store to continue up 100% nonstop?"
"Well I bought a 2 New TV's, laptop, Firepad, a bunch of other techy things in the past 2 months from BestBuy and loved the curbside service and the prices definitely are competitive now more than ever compared to Amazon were I had typically went for the best deal. They seem to be on track for a huge online business boom they lacked for a while."
"There is a theory, if Stocks end at 69.00, then next day it close at 96.00. Good luck."

"I went to BBY on Friday, parking was full, store was packed."
Time and price of execution is determined by the market maker $BBY $VENA
Who visited Best Buy over the weekend there was so many people
But a lot on the dip. Due for a big breakout.
"so many people asking why the stocks down.. if the stock market made perfect sense all the time it would become very predictable and guess what.. we cant all be rich which means the stock market has to be unpredictable and sometimes make no sense, the main thing is In the long run stocks will make their way to their correct price of what the company is worth so as for BBY in my opinion this still has to go back up unless something major happens to the company's value which I can't see happening to be honest. good luck"
"I've said this before and now once again. DO NOT SELL YOUR BBY holdings. I'll give you an example of what BBY is doing in our area. They are remodeling one of their 2 store's in Ocala. Fla. It will only sell stock dented, scratched, slightly used merchandize, etc. Ocala is about 22 miles from The Village's Fla. John Travolta has a big horse ranch there. Resident's see him occasionally @ Denny's, WMT, gas stations called WAWA. so on. He tells people that ""I only look like him."" We local's know him. Anyway, BBY decision to open this new store will be wonderful for the retiree's in this area. Some on very low income's. Great idea!"
"If it happened to NOK, it can happen to GE. Newly crowned Rhoodies flush with cash are gonna want to sell out of $GME, $BBY and $NOK and play the next game in town with GE."
Nothing can stop me from waiting here for the rocket to arrive $BBY $VENA
What I don’t understand is this stock was trading high. After I bought there are now an analyst saying this is a bad stock and stores are closing
"They can's get away with it! It's being looked into...From Robinhood “ We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities."""
Once again excellent QTR - Once again BBY falls after results. Only fly in the ointment is they front loaded some early holiday shopping into the QTR so I do understand why they did not give guidance - Another week and we will be back in in the uptrend.
Nice reversal over the last week or so. Should continue upwards!
go go go. 117. after earning 127. my opinion. buy/sell at own risks
Just wait when new stimulus comes
Come on... where are the upgrades ?
Remember buy now as this stock by Christmas will have record numbers$$$$
Take a look at DLTR after yesterdays overblown drop.
110++ tomorrow
Should continue to rise from now into earnings. Q4 results are on deck 
Agreed
I have a really good feeling this will pop huge after earnings.
"College has started, laptops and monitors are needed."
Holding nicely ! Going up from here !
"I've owned BBY in the past, but I'm back in. Too cheap, so much upside. If anyone can compete with Amazon, it's Best Buy. I used to buy video games on Amazon, but Best Buy has just as good if not better prices. Not to mention that most people like to buy high end electronics in store, not online. Great company, great stock!"
I ordered 1000 shares at $107.10 not single people wanna sell it what happened here
"Remember Best buy in 2013 ! $12.40, when I took the risk and now flourish. The management were able to transform to todays BBY. Remember Radio Shack, part of history. Survival of the fittest !!!"
"I bought 30 shares around $116 after ER, everyone touted a excellent qtr but the price is in free fall. Sold 15 shares yesterday. When it stops falling I will buy back, or just write it off and move on. All big retailers are complaining about transport logistics during the holidays, that's why the uncertainty in guidance."
"I think this will go down after earnings, even if it beats them. People who got in early will pull out their cash and the people who bought in late will probably sell of when the price dips as a result. It will most likely rebound however, and I would buy in the dip."
"Great opportunity to buy a great company on the dip. Scooped up shares at $75.30. No brainer buy! Yes, Q3 profits will slow but that's because they are INVESTING in their operations heavily this quarter for ""long term success""."
"Loaded another 500 shares, my H/F says BBY is going over 125.00 tomorrow and then with holidays this is a no brainer especially because BBY was pulled back in the last week"
"BBY at a bargain, 21Billion market cap, sounds good to me."
$BBY Total Debt (mrq) 3.99B
I told you amateurs not sale on such good quarterly reported numbers and the Black Friday and xmas sales being in play now....we go to $129
$21b market cap. That is ridiculously undervalued for a company that owns a big percentage of the consumer electeonics market.
Someone dumped almost 100k shares four minutes before close today. Insider misinformation? This is going higher.
Excellent report - beat in every metric - the stock has also busted above the neckline of the head and shoulder pattern - headed to new highs this year.
Here's an idea for management - Since BBY already has a health care side of the business - and - is also in just about every city...They should offer to provide vaccine shots (when we get it) and a promotion blitz in the stores. Great way to increase traffic into the stores.
BBY to the moon
They increased dividend and stock purchase program... This is great
"Everybody read the headline from Yahoo, but not the ending.The bump won’t last, but it will change how people buy techBut the spike in device sales may have already peaked.According to Huang, the devices that people have been snatching up were largely left over from the winter season when retailers stocked up out of fear that tariffs on goods made in China would hurt their sales.What consumers are buying now, he explained, are the remainders of that stockpile. Going into Q2, he said, the industry may be faced with a tightening supply chain in China as in-demand parts become hard to come by as a result of the extended Lunar New Year and subsequent factory closures in the country. While many manufacturers are getting back to normal, the lag time in making parts will start to hit device makers.“By the time we go into Q3,” Huang said, “we could be months into a global recession, and so we’re concerned about how consumer confidence will track then.”"
let the seller leave
"Every other retailer out there is up. Why is this down? Despite all the positive news and low pe, and vaccine coming ??? What’s the bad news here? Isn’t it overall sales and eps they should be looking at? Does I store sales this season matter so much?"
"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/how-to-trade-best-buy-stock-after-earnings-august-2020Literally the same thing happened on Q2 earnings call. The executives love to underpromise and over-deliver apparently, but they also mentioned in transcript a stock buyback. Bite your nails for a week and then should be back in green."
c'mon guys BBY will bounce back. this was upgrade it last month to $85 a share and they had great earnings report today there's a lot of tension with China with Tariffs that's is going to be in consideration next month but before that happens BBY will bounce back in the next couple's day's.....once everything settles this is bouncing back up. it should start bouncing up as soon as tomorrow heading for next week....
What a bargain at this priceI am buying 100 shares today2-3months will be around 130-140$2021 models of computers and tv

"$BBY $W $VENA This wouldn’t be an easy ride, but its gonna be worth it"
Holding strong ! Yes ! This will recover soon !
Huge red day across the markets worldwide today so this dip isnt worrying me
Although undervalued - being green after a horrible market day is a positive .
Not bad for a quick swing trade IMO. In at the 75s. Good luck to all Cheers!
Over reaction. Buying opportunity here today. Stock will be closer to 90 in a very short period of time.
Hope they announce a split soon.
Cramer declared Best Buy a buy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJKC9-5Q6Lo
Analyst Kate McShane has a success rate of 67% (178 out of 266 ratings were successful) and an averagereturn of 9.2%. This is a professional? My wife's automated Betterment account returns twice that. Haha!
Visited our local BBY at 1 pm today. It was packed! Had two problems: finding a parking space and getting help in the store. Researched Xbox games and BBY has the best prices - sale - picked up black ops 4 for a present.
"Contrarian investing is a wise strategy. Bought BBY at $75.30, up to $77.70 in AH. Bought CRR eight trading days ago at $7.49, touch $8.99 today. FWIW, CRR is an EXCELLENT long term contrarian play even at today's closing price of $8.71. Bought KTOV at $1.72 6 days ago, touched $1.87 today. Bought BABA at $172 even a few days ago, hit $182.38 today. Bought IQ at $24.78 10 trading days ago, hit $32 today. The point is, BUY WHEN EVERYONE IS SELLING and SELL WHEN EVERYONE IS BUYING."
BBY has a head and shoulder pattern - Look for a breakout above neckline around 61-62 for a solid buy. Earnings will likely show us the direction.
BBY shares are now down 7 days in a row....Beat on earnings...beat on revenue...geometric increase in online sales.....share have tanked 13% since the earnings report.....This is absurd....illogical.....and a gross disconnect with fundamental value.....
"Honestly I’m somewhat glad for this drop. I’ve been able to average down from 114 to 106.7 per share. Still at a loss, but $BBY has too much going for it"
"Why is this stock only up 4% ? They killed Q2, and beating revenues by 10% in Q3 ! I dont get it"
Stock dives at the end of the day. I would be willing to bet earnings has already been leaked out.

"I have never been more sure of a long opportunity, this stock is almost certain to bounce straight back and possibly fly straight past previous highs, an absolute golden buy oppurtunity here guys if I didn't have most of my capital tied up in Draftkings stock I would have it all in this big bad bull  BULLISH !!"
"Looks like a lot of traders were looking for a short term pop - did not happen and they are unwinding. BBY gets no respect when comparing to its high flying peers. BBY has a bright future: 5G rollout, Increase gaming, Medical Family Health Care, APPL upgrade product cycle, Increase support of home office, Home theaters (watch sports), Holiday shopping season.....and can go on........"
Best Buy is up 4.93% to 117.69
"So easy to gain on short Did on 71.25, less than 30min, it drops to 70.3"
"Kirk, Tomorrow is going to be a GREAT DAY keep loading"
BBY is not going any lower from here. They had a great quarter and didn't provide guidance and that's why it is reacting this way. Moving right into the best time for holiday sales. So I wouldn't even think twice to buy it now. Good luck to you all longs.
"A week ago, articles said how BBY was destined to fail, a sinking ship. How quickly the market manipulatirs move....."
Back to mid 80’s next 2 weeks
If you think we will have a summer rally (I do) then this stock would be my top pick with a cheap forward PE. BBY has a lot of cards they have no shown yet (i.e. smart homes / health care market) plus excellent management. Of course if you hate BBY for what ever reason (not sure what that would be) - go ahead and short.
"Last chance to get bby sub 110, dont listen to the analyst who gave it a thumbs down, she didn't go to harvard. Best buy is a giant in 2021."
"Went to Best Buys yesterday, it was PACKED. Amazing how this store has turned it around."
"Best Buy is on top of it - ""Best Buy is offering a new ""parent hub"" this year to provide tech tips on ways to manage distance learning.Best Buy also has launched a suite of free online courses for students called Geek Squad Academy At Home, inspired by its Geek Squad Academy summer camps, on topics such as smartphone photography, binary code and how to build video games and websites."""

"BBY was already pulled back last few weeks, earnings are going to make BBY over 125.00"
I upgrade BBY to outperform with price target 149.
Look at their return policy. 2 weeks isn’t long enough. Especially for a gift. Walmart is 90 days
"SBUX sales down 70%, so just think BBY in a few weeks."
Not a big fan of bby but when GameStop is worth as much something is seriously wrong.
"My fellow BBY investors/traders,1. We are now very close to the $100 price for BBY...2. I am still watching this stock and hopefully, when it crosses into the $99.99 price, I will start creating buy orders...3. Many commentators are predicting that BBY will go down to the $90 price range...4. I stopped applying logic with many stocks: For BBY, it's clear that the stock did well during 3rd quarter. Since this is the holiday season, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, New Years, Kids must have computers/printers for remote schooling, etc... I assumed that BBY will do very well.5. As you can see, BBY is still going down.... for almost 9 days now...6. Anyone has some insights as why BBY is not doing well?... for 9 days now...Peace!"
Who bought on Friday? Big boys playing options game and going short. They plan on leaving everyone who bought the hype high and dry today.

Reminder that Monday is Ex-Dividend - so you must buy today to receive the $0.55 quarterly dividend that's payable on Jan 5.
not even up 1% from last 3 months.
The house of cards falls on the 28th. There has to be guidance as it is too late in quarter to punt like rest of market.
we hit 105+ we are headed straight to 110. Solid results for a red day.

"Target, Walmart, and etc doesn't have tech support like Geeksquad. That service alone is billions of dollars. No one can beat bby in that. Millions of people are using the service remote support as I type. Company made 15 billion last 4 quarter alone."
"Open letter to Corie Barry (CEO) and Matt Bilunas (CFO):Best Buy has an impressive track record of reporting strong quarterly revenues & earnings, but your reluctance to provide financial guidance has subjected the stock price to undue volatility. Your management team certainly knows more about the business than any analyst or investor, so why would you not share some basic, current information to help guide and soothe the market? Many other companies are able to provide guidance in a deliberate and careful way without incurring liability - why can't you do the same?Copy and post."
"If the other retail giants did well, BBY will do even better. Watch for exceeding earnings estimates massively!"
This is a strong company and making money.
Volume too high..don’t touch this until wed next week
What investors are beginning to understand is that bby is transitioning to being a technology company with the purchase of great call. They are expanding their reach and capabilities.
Spoke with local general manager. Sales up in his district 12% over this time last year.

I have a strong feeling that the stimulus check will go directly to this company. a lot of people did not deserve the check and will buy new toys .
$80 coming on Thursday.
BBY has an amazing dividend and we are already on the low end of the share price wooohooooo LOADING UP
"Tariff talk for 2020 causing this very short-term downdraft - BBY was just being honest in its guidance. The way I look at it - what other retail stock is this cheap. BBY has great growth and top management (tgt,wmt,amzn PE's well above BBY)?Time will tell."
Worst message board ever.
This stock needs a spark and then it’ll be a fast ride to 125.
Buying the DIP here!
I'm a little confused when I look at annual results over the past four years earnings has barely grown at all and even revenue hasn't changed much 2020 compared to 2019 is almost identical yet the stock price has more than doubled what gives?
$BBY: D.A. Davidson raises target price to $137 from $135

Very impressive comps but even better .....the stock is relatively cheap and the real key is they upgraded guidance - all good.
BBY is ramping up to lift off. Best few days we’ve had!! 110 here we come
All stock are overpriced but this one is the only cheap stock when the people realize are going to come here

We are going through so much tech change in our lives. Where do you think people are going to go to learn about and it buy. Best Buy. Great online presence and great store locations. Trading at .74 times revenue. Should be atlease 1X. Fair value in my opinion is $135.00.
"CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF BEST BUY CO., INC.1:07 pm ET February 25, 2021 (CFRA) PrintWe keep our 12-month target at $135, 15.3x our initiated FY 23 (Jan.) EPS estimate of $8.80, above the 3-year historic average. We lift FY 22's to $8.10 from $7.48. BBY posts Q4 GAAP EPS $3.10 vs. $2.84, missing consensus. Sales were up 11% to $16.9B, missing consensus, which we attribute in part to more spread out holiday shopping season. We keep Buy to reflect tactical stance in Retail tilted Covid-19 winners, alongside our belief that many elements of stay-at-home economy are here to stay. While Covid-19 survivors were forced to drastically cut expenses, ultimately poorly positioning them to capitalize on secular changes in consumer behavior, BBY has had luxury due to financial strength ($6B cash) of playing offense, creating competitive advantages via investments to bridge bricks & clicks (ship from store; curbside; same day delivery) as well as a commitment to shareholder return (dividend +27%). We see a number of catalysts driving shares to new highs: 5G innovation, console launch, and health tech."
ALL IN. 116 at close. my opinion. buy/sell at own risk
ok let's hope they hit on earnings and rev.hope we see 90.00.
"I do not follow this stock, but I have spent tens of thousands of dollars with Best Buy. Two of the printers I have purchased over the past 14 months just died and I went back to replace them. I could not replace either one as they are out of stock and the store cannot offer a timeline as to when they may be in stock. The good news is there is plenty of demand. The bad news is there is nothing to sell and on top of that the “salespeople”, if you can find one, appear to care less. This was pretty spread across several items including cameras, laptops and PC’s. I realize this is not new news, but if there is no “stock” how can they maintain there stock price."
Love how all these CEOs of cyclical companies give cautious guidance only to have the consumer knock it out of the park qtr after qtr. DON’T bet against the American consumer.
We will open $300
"No hurry to buy, will pull back in afternoon closingSell high buy low more back"
Why do so many chase falling stocks thinking they are getting a bargain? You do not know how far it will fall. I sold at 115. Sentiment is negative. I will buy back IF and when sentiment turns positive and it begins a steady increase in price. I want to see about 107 with good volume before I would consider an entry.By the way I have been trading Bby since the 1980s. Look back at history. This can have huge swings. Can be frustrating but when it soars it's a blast.

"On quote from Robin Hood: So in other words destroy the revolution, the investors - not suspend the market, but only sellers are allowed to trade. In other words only those supporting the position of Hedge funds shorting the stock are permitted to trade. Can you imagine if the reverse happened? At least the corruption is laid bare, that's something - I hope Robin Hood gets destroyed. Then the next retail-platform will realise what not to do.

"As you know, the retail sector got pummeled last week due to initial reports of disappointing holiday traffic. However, the WSJ reported that while in-store sales were -4%, online was +78%. The best part for BBY holders is that electronics in-store sales were +2%, but a whopping +350% online. If most recent sales data continues to follow this trend, then BBY stock price should recover very quickly.https://www.wsj.com/articles/2020-holiday-sales-how-where-and-when-consumers-are-buying-11606996800"
"More solid progress given the market is down. Heading in the right direction. $BBY is still single handedly the busiest store in my area.I spoke with a local manager and he said they're up year over year even with being shut down for almost 3 months (in Canada). Noted that online says are through the roof and the ""pick up in store"" option for shipping has gone extremely well.If only we had management that could provide guidance!!!"
Looks like a buying opportunity
updates related to employee pay evolution and Q2 FY21 quarter-to-date sales performance.Employee Pay EvolutionThe company is raising the starting hourly wage for all Domestic employees to $15 effective Aug. 2.
"BBY has been a great stock! - I sold some in March and then got back in July. Of all the high flying retailers this stock is sporting just a 20 PE (Yes, on the high end for BBBY but looking forward....very low). They already told us that on-line sales are a blockbuster so looking forward to a nice earnings release next week."

"Buy into the rise on Monday, and then sell by the close."
And by the way if you’re buying Apple products they are cheaper at Best Buy that at the Apple store or at the Apple online store.
BBy is looking good. Short a 1000 shares at 80.75 from $77. Thanks for the dip last week.
"sold my shares today, might be overvalued given the economic situation"
Anyone know what’s happening today?

When bestbuy published eps the value of the stock goes Wednesday around 150$$ above
AMZN needs BBY for in-store demonstrations of Amazon smart-home products. This bigger than most people understand.
should be crossing 80 soon. then look for a split announcement when it hits 85 to 90.
"We bought a 65"" Samsung last week. The store was packed. BB is outpricing EVERYONE. Do not miss this buying opportunity. Low overhead. Super dividend coming. Stock is about as low as it will go."
"Open letter to Corie Barry (CEO) and Matt Bilunas (CFO):Best Buy has an impressive track record of reporting strong quarterly revenues & earnings, but your reluctance to provide financial guidance has subjected the stock price to undue volatility. Your management team certainly knows more about the business than any analyst or investor, so why would you not share some basic, current information to help guide and soothe the market? Many other companies are able to provide guidance in a deliberate and careful way without incurring liability - why can't you do the same?"
"These CEO's need to concentrate on how well they did and sell buyers on the idea their on fire and doing so well in a crisis situation. Everything was positive including a 242% increase in online sales.""Insane"" This should have blown up today with momentum coming into the day but guess I will have to wait until tomorrow when everyone realizes the positives reported."
This used to be one of the best stocks in my portfolio. Disappointing performance over the last two quarters.
No momentum in this stock right now. Hopefully strong Holliday numbers will lead to a strong start to 2021.
Amazing - look at the earning revisions estimates for this quarter......90 days ago 0.60 / 60 days ago 0.78 / 30 days ago 0.79 / 7 days ago 1.05 / current 1.08......Almost double!
My god can this close $70 today
"Shares of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) are holding fast above its 200-day moving average, capping a 40%-plus rally off of its late December lows. The stock has enjoyed a number of analyst upgrades lately, including from Telsey Advisory Group who raised their price target to $74 on confidence in solid execution, market share gains, and traction in its services offerings.The company will next report results on May 29 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 86 cents per share on revenues of $9.1 billion. When the company last reported on February 27, earnings of $2.72 beat estimates by 14 cents on a 3.7% drop in revenues."
Couple articles about $BBY being at a good entry point. Could see some solid numbers this week

"im sad all my contracts are now going to be rock bottom, any advice anyone? please do I sell them or hold till Friday when it expires."
"Uhm im sorry you wont see me buying a 4 k tv or any high cost electronic from amazon without seeing the product now , plus best buy is the only electronic game in town."
Has anyone been to a Best Buy recently? They are a ghost town. This puppy is gonna drop 20% tomorrow
Hold on tight - the ship has left the port.....Its going to be a long trip upward. BBY has so many ways to excel - New products - AI - Games - Medical devices - Smart homes and the list goes on.
What’s reason for going down past days??
$136 tomorrow
Macy is redeeming 1.3B of debt due 2025 ahead of scheduled and will realize an interest savings of about 120M per year. This translates into an EPS increase of .384 cents that wasn't previously factored into guidance. Give that a multiple of 8.5 PE and you get 3.27 increase in share value just due to this savings. M CFO also said by the end of the year the leverage ratio will be low enough that M will be considered investment grade! M must be doing much better than expected! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-retires-debt-ahead-schedule-234915266.html
"Best guidance ever Black Friday , Ciber Monday Christmas"
"as a worker of best buy, i’ve been betting against best buy for a while now. The company isn’t coming out as a winner this holiday season. Stores are experiencing no foot traffic at all and curbside feature was a huge fail during the black friday week and is simply not making up for the missed in store sales. Employees are treated like trash( we don’t even get a 10 min break during 10 hours shifts because of how short- staffed we are). Bonunes haven’t been paid in 1.5 years while walmart has paid 2 times this year alone. This company is a huge disappointment and can only go down from here"
Just removed some uncertainty with today’s news. I Predict over 100 after earnings. This is still a very cheap stock - extremely cheap when compared to TSLA. BBY will have several good years with all the new 5g products in the pipeline and.....not to mention the medical side of the business.
"50 dollar stock, have you seen the empty stores.....will be the next Circuit City."
GS analyst failed to factor in the new hybrid retail model and its future. I do not see any downtrend for BBY in 2021.
Full speed ahead! We are moonbound! Anyone notice that bestbuy stores are immune to covid? Nobody seems to care about covid there!
"Seriously? Down almost $2.50/share a little over 2 hours into the trading day, and NO comments from anyone? I don't even see any news headlines on this. THANKS, Yahoo/Altaba/Oath/Whatever-you're-calling-yourself-now. /sarc"
Get ready for this PS5 new Xbox and Black Friday cyber Monday BOOM
Yes! Guys $GME $AMC $KOSS $SNDL $BB $BBY - $TRIT is the real goal now !
"all big box retailers have been down the last week or two. Target, walmart, costco etc. I think the negative articles of no customers in stores cast a dark cloud over the sector yet ignoring record online sales. This will naturally correct up. Need patience"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
So why is stock going down at the end of the day?
Nine consecutive days in decline since earnings report...that’s what they get for beating all estimates....
Loaded another 300 shares at 112.19
Further drop? How low will the pe go?

All time high by earning date !
BBY CEO and CFO Need to focus on growth and cutting cost vs focusing on how much they are paying their employees.
Buy the dips
Best Buy is one of the few brick and mortars with a winning strategy. This should be trading much higher
"Company has profit and has positive Cash flow, but yet people try and put this company down."
"Now, everyone wants to buy BBY and say it is very cheap at these levels. Looking great and should see 80's into 90s. Waiting for the stock split coming soon."
"Best Buy is a gem, with 46B rev next year projected. The price/rev ratio is <1 and its PE is 18. And its online business is growing really fast, so it has a huge potential on its stock price."
BBY feeling the impacts from the weakest retailers today - BBY is several classes above - so hold on.
Will be at 85 - 90 in 2 weeks or less.
"""Best Buy's earnings per share have been growing at 13% a year for the past five years."""
It was almost 50% rose in last 3 months. Should be corrected regardless of positive earnings surprise. Good company tho. Market is market.
What a txrd! This stock is now down for 8 consecutive days.....down 15 % since earnings report....Management has done a poor job of communicating with the market......
"beat net sales estimates by 880 million, easy decision here."
3 days green then correction $1 down then green until 125$ good luck everyone
"Goldman Sachs lowers Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) to a Sell rating after having the retailer slotted at Neutral.Goldman's bearish thesis: ""Best Buy is one of the best run retailers in the U.S. and continues to evolve its omnichannel, but as we look to 2021 we see risk for the stock based on: 1) very strong compares; not only from strong sales in 2020 but the ability to capture ~80% of sales when the stores were closed, making it a harder compare, 2) its lack of gross margin flow through in 2020, 3) valuation."""
"Best Buy should cleanup this Christmas. I bought a gift online from BBY and got it delivered as fast as Amazon. I'm a believer in their new e-commerce and curbside pickup transformation. If it goes into the $90's, I'm buying more!"
Starting to forget what green looks like
If you are long this after the truly impressive run it has had AND after TGT said they missed on CE sales and you have not taken money off the table you deserve to lose everything you made (and more for being so careless in your trading).
After a big run-up - the stock needs to back and fill to find support. I would Like to see 67 as support? Once we find support we can jump much higher. Look at what happen to RCL after it gapped up with earnings.
Why this stock keeps dropping??
Looks like the pre market gains are not holding. Let's see how we open. 9% sales gain is pretty impressive.
"Great earnings and the words likely taper makes it tumble. “Best Buy said it expected third-quarter sales to be higher than last year, but growth would likely taper in coming weeks”."
I heard about BBY the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"BBY raises dividend to $.55 per quarter or $2.20 year which is now 1.95%. Way more than any savings , high yield savings, money market or CD would be paying while we wait for stock price to gain."
looks like we've found some footing at 102-103!
"There's no reason to panic. The ebb and flow is natural, and this is a strong company doing well."
