"Profits will be up because they FAR exceeded targeted layoffs in 2019. If you need to increase your stock price by annually axing 50-5,000 people you have a problem."
The only person happy with this deal is Peter Lambertus
"Time to merge with BK or JPM just too small , not innovative , too backward in management to do any better. They build the business based on higher interest rates and for next 3 years not going up."
State Street reached a 52 Week high at 98.99
State Street from Today and into the FutureSTT is doing what others in the industry are moving towards: rationalization/outsourcing - trying to identify a successful future.I look at what has happened to GE's. Jack Welch. He cultivated a culture to realize operational excellence by picking leadership winners. What happened: financial engineering tactics that steered GE to produce winners. These winners did not know how to innovate - taking GE away from its innovative roots and gutting it's business to hit it's numbers.What does this have to do with SST? Can leadership truly steer SST toward future innovative services/systems? I question whether SST leadership knows what to do.
Any word on layoffs today?
"5 year period now the Dow is up 10,000 points while this dog stock is down over 20% (and still paying SEC fines). Where is the board making tough decisions? JPM is up, NTRS is up. Why are all the CEO's still raking on 8 figure packages and bonus's? When will the board wake up that laying off the 40-50 year olds time and time and time and time and time and time again isn't getting it done?"
Culture of plausible deniability Defrauds customers and destroys trust - gets caught - pays fine - board does nothing to CEO comp or clawback of comp - no jail time. Grifter Street Bank
I WORKED AT STATE STREET FOR 10 YEARS IN SOFTWARE SUPPORT. They got rid of a lot of talented system support people and instead farmed it all out to IBM. Brilliant ? Hardly. They found that IBM charged for every grimace and the 'Dedication' of thats the proper word allowed to people State Street deemed to terminate around the holidays just was not 'There' in the performance of the new guardians of System Support. Who was going to stay up all night and weekends to resolve issues ?
Instead of buying another company shouldn't they increase risk controls since they have paid out 779 MILLION since 2000 and several employees have been arrested by the Feds?
It’s time to be bought by money center bank - trading at almost 5 year low. The leadership is without a clue.
This is very fishy here’s your Lehman moment there trying too hide 183 trillion in bad trades this is the start of the end game! By November you will see and know it’s over the bank is keeping your money. Remember mf global well that’s all banks
does anybody think the top 5 execs at STT are worth 3.6 million a year each ? 18 million dollars for exactly what pearls of wisdom are they imparting to have the stock stagnate for the past 3 years
wow down over 5 dollars on a 1 penny miss a little over reaction?
"Man do I feel bad for a lot of STT workers, cost cutting ""projects"" that have been in effect for 10 years now coupled with this severe downturn. Anyone over 40 is tossing and turning every night."
Mellon And STT Need New Management And New Boards. Neither Company Knows What They Are Doing. Both Companies Are Private ATM's For The C.E.O.'s And Boards And Senior Management.
Ouch.... Did not see this slide coming. Hopefully rallies during the day.
"WHY is the market up, and continues to go up while main street is on the verge of catastrophe ?the disconnect is glaring."
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"Did I read it right that it has 194 per share in cash in Yahoo statisticso? Minus debt, it still has 97 dollars net cash at a stock price of 51. Did I miss anything ?"
This may be the only company where it beats earnings eastimates and stock price fails.
"If it can generate 1.3 earning per share per current quarter, i will be happy. Full year, it should be able to earn 2 billions at least."
Price-to-cash ratio of 0.2. That's almost the best of any S&P 500 company. Only Citigroup has a better P/C.
It’s curious that despite all the fraud committed by execs and fines paid no executive was asked to return/disgorge their bonus. Cheating clients was just part of the culture . The board has to realize the only way to fix the culture is to sell the corporation and eliminate their amoral inbred culture - the execs know where to find me .
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE SO CALLED 'INCENTIVE CLAUSES' OF MANAGEMENT IF THEY ACQUIRE ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY ? I'm quite sure this goes registers on their yearly bonus. Will is also register as a take away when such actions result in failures ?
If you bought this stock in April 2006 and sold it today you would break even
"Wow, Hooley finally leaving in a couple weeks. STT down 36% for the year, pretty fitting since it really has been a dog his entire tenure. That, billing scandals that led to people being fired, sec lending scandals that led to people IN JAIL and laying off thousands of American workers will be his lasting legacy. Not bad since he probably made $80,000,000 as CEO."
The real facts is 2018 Q3 last year STT made $1.87 and this year they are forecasting $1.39 only down over 25% the good news is they have dropped the whisper number but it's still down 25% not good https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/stt
State Street is up 5.03% to 97.39
"Beats earnings estimates and revenue rises, stock price crashes."
Every time I buy this STT stock they come out with something to cause the stock to Trade down and down.........These managers have NO clue what they are doing!How can Net Income be down that much from this recent quarter?I guess that means all my other Banks are gonna be reporting stuff like this Loser Bank called State Street Corporation......They sure got me to dump my Wells Fargo stock since I don't trust them either.
"total assets under custody and administration were $40.3 trillion, up 26.4% year over year. Incredible and can grow further."
"Need to get rid of 50% of Senior management - they need to have metrics that continually justify their role and pay while making sure their “hero’s” business units revenue will not lead to call from FBI or SEC. Most importantly learn to say “no” and send more bonus money to people who use their hands and brains every day to process trades, program, test , try new ideas - and not keep 80% of bonus pool for the top 100"
It is a good entry point for this company. It should be re-rated as a technology company with their services in the demand area of increased trading volume.
"Market down 1k over 2 days, I can hear the 10 SVP's in HR from here huddling up on how to increase layoffs at STT."
The board should sell the company for the good of the shareholders - that’s who they work for.
"State Street has notified close to 2% of the employees to be laid off at the end of April. It is the very few big banks doing layoffs at the worst time of COVID. This reflected that STT is expecting a serious lose in the immediate quarters. Its actual cash level must be in serious trouble. With thousands of oil companies in distress state and millions families stop pay mortgage due to COVID related job loses, STT can very likely be the first tiers of banks to be bankrupted."
"""While record low interest rates created a significant headwind in 2020"" This widely underperforming company has been singing this sad tune quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter since 2008. They need a new slogan to blame it all on. How about, ""when you hit 40 start looking over your shoulder because you will be laid off very soon"""
State Street reached a 52 Week high at 95.59
