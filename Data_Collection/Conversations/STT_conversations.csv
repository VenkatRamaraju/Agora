STT reached a new All Time High at 102.79
anyone playing this for earnings fri morning?
"Need to get rid of 50% of Senior management - they need to have metrics that continually justify their role and pay while making sure their “hero’s” business units revenue will not lead to call from FBI or SEC. Most importantly learn to say “no” and send more bonus money to people who use their hands and brains every day to process trades, program, test , try new ideas - and not keep 80% of bonus pool for the top 100"
"5 year period now the Dow is up 10,000 points while this dog stock is down over 20% (and still paying SEC fines). Where is the board making tough decisions? JPM is up, NTRS is up. Why are all the CEO's still raking on 8 figure packages and bonus's? When will the board wake up that laying off the 40-50 year olds time and time and time and time and time and time again isn't getting it done?"
Any word on layoffs today?
"Open letter to Jay Hooley: many of your management team is either under investigation or already convicted. Why don’t you just cash out and admit that you simply cannot manage this company? Poor decision-making, destroying lives of your loyal and hard-working employees makes you a poor leader. You simply are not someone who can continue to carry this once-great company forward."
"They refuse to pay their employees, many are making the same pay since 2008!!!!! Start looking elsewhere, the pay and grass are both Greener!! The amount of consultants working at STT is sickening."
STT-PG is down 7.41% to 22.13
Mellon Is In The Same Shape. They Could Merge And Reduce Staff By At Least 50%??????????????
STT-PG is down 4.93% to 23.53
STT should just put the world out of it's misery and agree to be acquired. Enough is enough.
"Did I read it right that it has 194 per share in cash in Yahoo statisticso? Minus debt, it still has 97 dollars net cash at a stock price of 51. Did I miss anything ?"
"Ross McClelland, the latest #$%$ at STT to be exposed. Making $2MM/year but still stealing from clients. Meanwhile hard-working, honest people are being laid off constantly. This is not the State Street that I once knew, and loved. Bill Edgerly, if he is still alive (and God Bless him) must be ashamed to see what this company has turned into. He made SSC what it was in it?s glory...now it?s become just another dog-eat-dog, screw the people who made it what it was, conglomeration. Jay Hooley, I hope you sleep well."
STT is down 7.25% to $73.92
State Street is up 5.19% to 76.46
STT is down 4.91% to $69.56
"Look down Jay...you’ll find your stock price. When the board wises up and realizes that you just rode an improving economy, and that you are NOT a leader or visionary, I hope you can still sleep well on your pile of money knowing that you destroyed the lives of a lot of loyal, hard-working people."
Seems like the only time State Street is in the National news is when they are either laying people off or paying more fines for overcharging clients.
State Street is up 4.97% to 63.42
State Street is down 4.91% to 82.26
They need to start paying their employees!!! Pay has been stagnant for over 10 years now!
STT will be an acquisition target at this exceptionally low price. The cash on hand will pay for itself.
So is this thing dropping $28 at the end of May to cover the upgraded dividend?
I WORKED AT STATE STREET FOR 10 YEARS IN SOFTWARE SUPPORT. They got rid of a lot of talented system support people and instead farmed it all out to IBM. Brilliant ? Hardly. They found that IBM charged for every grimace and the 'Dedication' of thats the proper word allowed to people State Street deemed to terminate around the holidays just was not 'There' in the performance of the new guardians of System Support. Who was going to stay up all night and weekends to resolve issues ?
Ouch.... Did not see this slide coming. Hopefully rallies during the day.
"Earnings today were a solid beat but this stock is off the radar of the average investor. at some point it will get an upgrade or a Cramer thumbs up and head back to the $70s. With today's earnings, the stock is on pace to have a P/E in the single digits next year. Safety plus dividend plus potential for growth!"
140 million charge just comes out of nowhere. Like management didn't know this before reporting 4th qtr. earnings. Instead of a 31 cent beat it should have been an 8 cent miss.
STT is down -5.18% to 87.94
I find it quite laughable that Hooley comes out with statements about turning his financial institution into a Tech firm. This is the light of SSTs core operating system for processing trades is a Main Frame from the 70s. He would do far better to sort out his firms internal issues first rather than fly off at a tangent. Mind you --what do you expect from an ex vacuum cleaner salesman???
its dropped over 2% in the last few hours :(
"Profits will be up because they FAR exceeded targeted layoffs in 2019. If you need to increase your stock price by annually axing 50-5,000 people you have a problem."
Massive trading volumes [9 Million 28 June 2019] but yet again failed to close above $56.35
STT-PG is down 6.88% to 23.93
STT UP 24% SINCE MID OCT/19
This is very fishy here’s your Lehman moment there trying too hide 183 trillion in bad trades this is the start of the end game! By November you will see and know it’s over the bank is keeping your money. Remember mf global well that’s all banks
"Market down 1k over 2 days, I can hear the 10 SVP's in HR from here huddling up on how to increase layoffs at STT."
WFC is a way better BUY than STT...........Outstanding shares is INcreasing at STT as opposed to other banks-WHY? STT should be rewarding shareholders by Decreasing share count so why has share count INCREASED like they have at STT? Their management must be Overpaid since WFC has Decreased share count like 200M this past year and has Decreased share count more than any other bank so it SEEMS TO BE A MUCH BETTER PLACE TO INVEST MONEY!
If you bought this stock in April 2006 and sold it today you would break even

Nothing changes
State Street reached a 52 Week high at 95.59
State Street from Today and into the FutureSTT is doing what others in the industry are moving towards: rationalization/outsourcing - trying to identify a successful future.I look at what has happened to GE's. Jack Welch. He cultivated a culture to realize operational excellence by picking leadership winners. What happened: financial engineering tactics that steered GE to produce winners. These winners did not know how to innovate - taking GE away from its innovative roots and gutting it's business to hit it's numbers.What does this have to do with SST? Can leadership truly steer SST toward future innovative services/systems? I question whether SST leadership knows what to do.
State Street reached a 52 Week high at 98.99
State Street is down 4.93% to 80.18
what's the deal with the upcoming $ 28.42 dividend ? Is STT calving off a hunk of the company ?
Every time I buy this STT stock they come out with something to cause the stock to Trade down and down.........These managers have NO clue what they are doing!How can Net Income be down that much from this recent quarter?I guess that means all my other Banks are gonna be reporting stuff like this Loser Bank called State Street Corporation......They sure got me to dump my Wells Fargo stock since I don't trust them either.
dow up over 180 points today and SS still struggling?!
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
wow down over 5 dollars on a 1 penny miss a little over reaction?
It’s a sale today it’s going to drop 8%
Z
I worked at this company and in the years since have had many dealings with them. I can confidently say they are the worst custodian in the industry and easily provide the worst service. They have VP's all over the place who are completely clueless and there only because of massive turnover and layoffs.
What is going on?
STT is down -4.92% to 101.55
STT should be valuate as a Technology company with over 20 times multiple with its moat in financial technology services offering
Sadly nothing to get price up except buy back the stock
"Yay, just about halfway back to their high of 114 not too long ago. #$%$ company to work for and stock is even worse, upper management gets all the money and promotions."
STT is too cheap with 10 pe +divident. i jus got in @$65.33 for 2000 shares and looking for 30% gain with 3 months.
STT reached a new 52 Week Low at $74.00
STT-PD reached a 52 Week high at 29.01
STATE STREET IS ON A MISSION TO BE THE BIGGEST AND PRESUMABLY THE BADDEST. They should review the dynamics of BANK OF NEW ENGLAND 20 years ago that acquired endlessly ignoring the DISHARMONIES that accompany mergers and take overs. 3O TRILLION evidently is not big enough for these fools. BEWARE .... Mis Management comes in many forms.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE SO CALLED 'INCENTIVE CLAUSES' OF MANAGEMENT IF THEY ACQUIRE ASSETS UNDER CUSTODY ? I'm quite sure this goes registers on their yearly bonus. Will is also register as a take away when such actions result in failures ?
Mellon And STT Need New Management And New Boards. Neither Company Knows What They Are Doing. Both Companies Are Private ATM's For The C.E.O.'s And Boards And Senior Management.
It’s curious that despite all the fraud committed by execs and fines paid no executive was asked to return/disgorge their bonus. Cheating clients was just part of the culture . The board has to realize the only way to fix the culture is to sell the corporation and eliminate their amoral inbred culture - the execs know where to find me .
It’s time to be bought by money center bank - trading at almost 5 year low. The leadership is without a clue.
"Here we go again. Starting out in a hole. Right now, this stock can't seem to put two positive days together. Still hopeful."

Bargain. Hit double bottom and it is on the rise . Next leg is up
"Lol, accounting for acqusition. it appears that it does not affect cash generation ability and will only increase. Tug in small acqusition is prudent and great synergy."
Liquidity and commercial papers supported by govt are there. STT is one of the biggest beneficiary with unlimited credits.
"David, pay closer attention. Why would the worlds worst company pay their people more while laying a bunch off every month? They absolutely do not care about a single one."
Oh dear. Looks like the market is less than enamoured with the Charles River deal. It's had plenty of time to recover yet it continues to fall
"The bank had its best run under Marsh Carter who understood both technology and innovation. Sadly every leader since has been riding the coattails of his decision and the fine work of his leadership team- jay ran check processing lockbox - which the board considered the training ground for custody, funds administration, and capital markets. And you wonder why stock has been dead for 15 years- greed and incentives that encourage bad behavior."
State Street is down 4.94% to 59.32
"State Street has notified close to 2% of the employees to be laid off at the end of April. It is the very few big banks doing layoffs at the worst time of COVID. This reflected that STT is expecting a serious lose in the immediate quarters. Its actual cash level must be in serious trouble. With thousands of oil companies in distress state and millions families stop pay mortgage due to COVID related job loses, STT can very likely be the first tiers of banks to be bankrupted."
"Financial custodian, asset manager, and financial services firm State Street (NYSE: STT) surged 13.7% in November, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . The Boston-based financial giant, which has been in business since 1792, is still attempting to claw its way back fr...

"Lost around 50% of value after acquiring CRD, was this such a bad acquisition?"
"Would you guys unload WFC. & pick up STT, C or JPM ?"
"The Dow huge bounceback day up 5% today, this dog of a pig stock was practically flat."
nice day for SS. let's hope it carries over into next week?? any advice? I have some shares invested
"Beats earnings estimates and revenue rises, stock price crashes."
The board should sell the company for the good of the shareholders - that’s who they work for.
"So Hooley's wallet is riding high after a good year? Shareholders need to ask how much he was receiving in compensation and why from 3/2008 until now. The stock has just now recovered it's value, only took State Street EIGHT YEARS. I bet he scored well over 100 million as the stock price did NOTHING."
"The ceo ,Hooley , when asked if he expected a 7 % decline in stock price after announcing the acquisition.answered ""YES""The answer should have been ""we did not expect such a large reaction, it was totally unwarranted.This stock is selling off because the investors like me are losing ""faith in management.Why buy a company and pay top dollar ,if it will not benefit the company until 2021 ( according to Hooley) and at the same time he cancels the stock buy back program and does not raise the dividend.Harvard business school apparently did not stress to him ,that his most important ""job""was to increase shareholder value,,,so far he has decreased shareholder value by almost 30%"
STT reached a new All Time High at 110.29
State Street is up 8.34% to 67.42
Everybody dissing this stock are strangely silent today. Interesting.
The Dow and pretty much every good company's stock are about back to January levels before the crash but not this company. Investors must be thrilled it is still 20% behind everyone else. Better ramp up layoffs to catch up Ron
Myron: Thanks for your post I could not understand why STT was not doing better you probably saved me from loosing money. May wait for awhile too loose money.

"I *was* thinking of buying some on the dip, and researched the CR purchase. So .. has STT issued those new shares, which it said it was going to in the press release? Further dilution.. And, purchase not expected to be accretive to earnings until 2020. Don't want to catch a falling knife, so I'm on the sidelines for now."
why is this convo so dead ?
"If it can generate 1.3 earning per share per current quarter, i will be happy. Full year, it should be able to earn 2 billions at least."
does anybody think the top 5 execs at STT are worth 3.6 million a year each ? 18 million dollars for exactly what pearls of wisdom are they imparting to have the stock stagnate for the past 3 years
The real facts is 2018 Q3 last year STT made $1.87 and this year they are forecasting $1.39 only down over 25% the good news is they have dropped the whisper number but it's still down 25% not good https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/stt
STT is a beneficiary of 0 interest rate. It should pop up greatly if you know FED pay STT to loan.
STT-PG reached a 52 Week low at 24.64
"SST will start to move up! Up! Up!I see a post written two years ago! (""Stock is down to $70) now it's $87, it was as high as $110. That was time to take profit. Inside word on this stock, big hedge fund buyers see low risk. good returns over the next 6 months."
What is the bad news today? Markets up big everywhere but this stock is down 2%
Looks nice a nice earnings report for the 4Q.
Untrustworthy
State Street is down 4.93% to 82.91
I wonder if Trump's warning to stop shooting jobs offshore then repatriating product will scare STT into not outsourcing valuable American jobs as they have been doing since 2004.
STT is up 4.94% to 85.15
"Man do I feel bad for a lot of STT workers, cost cutting ""projects"" that have been in effect for 10 years now coupled with this severe downturn. Anyone over 40 is tossing and turning every night."
STT reached a 52 Week high at 83.81
"Time to merge with BK or JPM just too small , not innovative , too backward in management to do any better. They build the business based on higher interest rates and for next 3 years not going up."
One of the strongest bank with 79 Billions cash on hand that can take advantage the opportunties
STT reached a new 52 Week Low at $69.02
"Wow, Hooley finally leaving in a couple weeks. STT down 36% for the year, pretty fitting since it really has been a dog his entire tenure. That, billing scandals that led to people being fired, sec lending scandals that led to people IN JAIL and laying off thousands of American workers will be his lasting legacy. Not bad since he probably made $80,000,000 as CEO."
great short squeeze
STT heading to $100 in 2021
"Give State Street credit, looks like their 10 years struggle to improve their stock price has finally happened this with quarter. Too bad the consensus is it was only achieved by laying people off to control expenses. People in the know posted over and over again how they needed to cut the fat from the do nothing high end VP's, SVP's and EVP's rather than the guy making $25/hour servicing clients."
"Lol, net interest income will rise"
"Looks like the Charles River purchase was a BAD decision. The stock has consistently been tanking ever since. Two bad companies, coming together to become even worse..."
The Dow on a downward spiral typically does not bode well for STT employees.
It is a good entry point for this company. It should be re-rated as a technology company with their services in the demand area of increased trading volume.
Positive insiders buying is another sign that SST will soar
This new format is a big step backwards. confusing! and not designed for anyone who is in the stock market. Go backto the old format!
Now STT is pulling back after trying to break through $80.twice in the last week. Something is needed and I don’t know what. So I am selling as I watch ......
"""While record low interest rates created a significant headwind in 2020"" This widely underperforming company has been singing this sad tune quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter since 2008. They need a new slogan to blame it all on. How about, ""when you hit 40 start looking over your shoulder because you will be laid off very soon"""
Culture of plausible deniability Defrauds customers and destroys trust - gets caught - pays fine - board does nothing to CEO comp or clawback of comp - no jail time. Grifter Street Bank
This may be the only company where it beats earnings eastimates and stock price fails.

Price-to-cash ratio of 0.2. That's almost the best of any S&P 500 company. Only Citigroup has a better P/C.

"State Street is the 2nd largest holder of PCG stock, it fell 50% today from 18 to 9 per share. State Street has lost billions over the last 3 months on PCG stock. Yes BILLIONS!"
the most corrupt bank in the word!
This stock is too cheap with the same earning power regardless of virus
I'M SURPRISED THAT NO ONE FROM THE GLOBE SPOT LIGHT NEWS INVESTIGATED THE SHENNANIGANS PERPETRATED BY STATE STREET IN OVER CHARGING ITS CUSTOMERS A FEW YEARS BACK. HOW NO ONE WENT TO JAIL. HOW MGT STILL RETAINED THEIR BONUSES WHILE LAYING OFF SOFTWARE TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS SO AS TO CONTROL EXPENSES. I GUESS ITS JUST NOT SEXY ENOUGH. THE PUBLIC IS JUST NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT AMOUNTS TO A LACK OF MORALS AND A FINANCIAL MORASS OF ACCOUNTING MISDEEDS. ISN'T THAT WAS ALSO CITED DURING THE ENRON SCANDAL FIASCO ? WHERE ARE THE JOURNALISTS ? THE REPORTERS. ?

Instead of buying another company shouldn't they increase risk controls since they have paid out 779 MILLION since 2000 and several employees have been arrested by the Feds?

STT has lost billions in the decline of PCG the utility that burned cali. They are the 3rd largest holder of the stock in the world. My word!
"I know someone who works at a State Street, I hope he still has a job."
What’s been causing all this volatility in $STT this week? Sudden drop Wednesday and now a spike on Friday. No other financials seem to have that drop or spike to the extent STT had
"WHY is the market up, and continues to go up while main street is on the verge of catastrophe ?the disconnect is glaring."
Tough day all all around.
"UMC stock price is way undervalued! Based on the evaluation of sales & going forward PE, UMC should be traded at $4.5 per shares now!UMC is gaining customers from TSMC! TSMC wafer prices is 25% to 30% higher than UMC's. Long term projection, 12 month target price for UMC is $7.5 per share!"
Who Is The Worse Bk Or STT?
"What a complete sick dog this stock is, trading at 2000 levels, no split, since then the Dow has been up 140 PERCENT What exactly have the recent CEO's done besides help drive it further down and not get arrested for fraud and/or overbilling clients?"
"Usually falls going into earnings, don't know what to expect for Q4."
