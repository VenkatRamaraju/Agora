Funny how there are no news articles about draft departure or wood sales om yahoo site.
"I once read about a non-profit which raised like $20Million in a quarter for it's charity, but then it had operating expenses of about $19.5 Milllion, and only $500K went to the charity. It reminds me of Peloton's numbers... on a different scale though."

Welcome to the 80s.
"Some very questionable PTON stock trading going on this month.1) Number of Sale transactions by Executives have been abnormally low2) Chief Legal Officer Kushi Sells 80,000 Shares the day before Director Draft Officially notifies the Board of his quick resignation -- the Chief Legal Officer's name is on the signature line of the related SEC 8-K Filing!3) Within 2 days of the 8-K filing related to Director Draft's departure, Cathie Wood's ARKW fund starts Selling Hundreds of Thousands of PTON sharesSeems to me that the SEC should be looking into this series of events and arrange interviews with, at a minimum, all suspect parties mentioned: ex-Director Draft, Chief Legal Officer Kushi, and ARKW fund CEO Cathie Wood."
"4 days worth of gains, gone in 2 days"
"What is concerning about Director Draft's quick departure is, Directors' terms expire on the same day as the annual meeting of stockholders, which is a little more than One Month away on Tuesday, December 7, 2021So why resign now, instead of waiting a month? Hmmmm."
"Rumor is, PTON will be issuing shares to raise desperately needed Cash.The share price is being floated (manipulated) to establish a decent offering price.ARKW caught wind of it and is taking this opportunity to get out before the offering is made public and the stock price expectedly falls as a result.The offering is rumored to be published sometime just before earnings are.But this is all an unsubstantiated rumor."
Cathie has a ‘Wood’ problem. It’s called PTON stock.
"earnings expected to decline well over 500% year over year. it will be a long time if ever, before you can even calculate a p/e for this stock"
If what I see is correct--Aunt Cathie SOLD almost 1/2 MILLION SHARES today...UH OH...at a BUY IN of $107 she is CUTTING HER LOSSES
How is Cathie Wood's obvious capitulation on PTON not moving this stock lower?
"4 DAY NOTICE OF RESIGNATION IS NOT NORMAL----On October 21, 2021, Howard Draft (“Mr. Draft”) advised the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the “Company”) that he would resign as a Class I independent director of the Company and as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board, effective October 25, 2021. Mr. Draft’s resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices."
their ads have been running non-stop on Lifetime (yes :) and Bloomberg) the new thing is a 30-day free return-sounds desperate imo to make the quarter or rescue it (posting a 2nd time as it somehow got deleted)
Cathie started selling
"If I am reading the ARKW holdings correctly, as of Last Night, they appear to still have 1,217,362 shares of PTON after Selling a total of 1,189,629 shares during the past Two Days."
Cathie wood dumped 26% of her holding yesterday!
How low will PTON drop after earnings report on Nov 4?
"I just bought 5 Nov. 12,2021 $86 puts and see it as a double or nothing move. I see pton as an expensive fad and with competition from amzn, I believe they'll guide down this quarter."
"Uh Oh!!""October 26, 20212:43 pm ET *Peloton Shares Down 3.4%; Co. 8-K From Monday Afternoon Showed Board's Independent Director, Member Of Audit Committee Resigned; Co. Said Resignation Not Result Of Any Disagreement With Co.Benzinga"""
