"If the Street couldn't give ZM a break, why would it show mercy for PTON?"
$45 Price target by BMO. Makes the case on YAHOO...
ALL of pton products are made from parts outsourced to China.
Bank of America and Loop Capital upgrades = hold the door while we let our clients out
"LOL--This is how its done...Nautilus (NYSE:NLS), for example, just reported a 62% jump in quarterly sales, primarily on the strength of its own connected fitness equipment under the Bowflex brand. It was able to report net earnings of $0.43 per share"
LOL going to $80 in 2 weeks !!!
Why does Yahoo erase when I post that Peloton has gone from $2 cash on hand to $1 debt on hand to $1 in cash on hand to $1 in debt on hand THIS QUARTER?Is someone SCARED?
"People, like Steve Ballmer, used to say iPhone is just a toy, a fad, too expensive..."
"Sitting on $1B of inventory lol.. if they were smart, they would sell Peter some shares right now at +$100 vs next quarter when they need it and can only raise at a $20B valuation lol"
"Let me get something straight zoom beat earnings, and analysts downgraded the based on revenues MAY BE SLOWING.” Peloton revenues tanked missed all estimates, being investigated from SEC to the SUPREME COURT…. And analysts said the stock is a BUY??? Are you kidding me??? LMAO!!"
The PTON global Tread will be a KEY parallel growth driver over the next 3to 5 years!
"If y'all look at the charts, its almost set up for the exact same pattern from mid April to the low of 83 and change on May 6th. At that time, we didn't have all the knowledge that we do currently. While they are doing their best to create an orderly exit in here, a solid breach of 100 does not bode well and I don't think the big boys want to be folding deck chairs on the Titanic..."
"@Peter. So basically Peloton is now a IRS section 501 charity giving away exercise bikes and treadmills below cost? But wait a minute….I thought stocks, earnings and profits were for viable growth companies?"
If you read on lawsuits section there is a derivative action lawsuits!! That’s some wild siht…. That’s what happen when there is no corporate governance!!

"You guys know most people are not renewing their gym memberships right? Website hits on gyms show they are going down since Delta started. Stocks like $PTON, $NVAX, etc. are the long play because humanity is losing to Delta. More variants are on the way, in just months. Some pandemics last over a hundred years."
ExtraBaby must be one of those $AFRM shorts 
"Finally some real numbers UBS Cuts Peloton Interactive's Price Target to $70 From $74, Citing 'Lower Margin Guide;' Sell Rating Kept"
What are the best books for operational strategies?
PT $300+
Once Peloton goes belly up repairs will become virtually impossible to obtain. Solution?-the blast furnaces to make new Nautilus equipment.
The problem for Peloton is this among many--THE $1 Billion in Marketing ALSO HELP the 20 COMPETITORS as people start to SHOP and PRICE SHOP.Competitors will ride the FREE ADS and EAT market share
"Here's for investors that are interested what Actual Analyst's Rating on PTON:1) Scott Devitt has $140 target initiated 8/27/21 he has a 131.60 % return on PTON2) Justin Post has a $138 Target initiated on 8/27/21 he has a 78.50% return on PTON3) Aaron Kessler has a HOLD on PTON with 98% return on PTONso if you folks do your DD, these are top Analyst covering PTON that has HIGH success and Return on their investments.Now sometimes a relative unknown Analyst will throw out a number that is way on the UP Side or Down Side such as BMO today. Why? they just want to be in the PUBLIC EYE with their name.-Hey it's just their opinion right?Happy Trading!"
"How is this company not bankrupt, or the executives not in federal prison?"
Why did peloton jump at 5pm?
"Pro-PTON people suggest PTON is geared toward overweight people losing weight and becoming healthier.Just one problem with that IDEA ... ""The Tread is built and tested for users between 4'11"" and 6'4"" in height and between 105 and 300 lb in weight.""Did you catch that? NOBODY over 300 lb should use PTON's Tread. Oooops! Guess THAT theory just got Negated by PTON themselves."
Just accumulate Boys- a little at a time!
Going to 50.00 fast
"Peloton will miss Q1 revenue and guide down further when they report in late October or early November. Because Q4 revenue still included orders placed in prior quarters that they were yet to deliver. The demand has dried up to a point that it's even below pre-pandemic level (because they reached peak growth and brand recognition during the pandemic and lockdown that majority of potential customers willing to purchase one have already done so) Adding to increased expenses (which they use as means to funnel money out of the company), increased competition, saturated market, decreasing interest and engagement (again, due to back to normalcy and the fact that only a fraction of users will keep the habit of exercising regularly), the company will have to find more distraction (things like they have announced recently - the so-called overseas expansion, or more partnerships with big brands that they pay, or new fluff products that will never be as successful as their bike had been).However, these old schemes and game will no longer be effective to prop up its share price. As the Fed changes policy direction, funds adjust portfolios accordingly to overweight value/cyclical/quality growth names. Pton will be traded like its competitors that a 50%-90% drop in its market cap from current level is warranted."
@Extradebaby2009 You mean the article in Barron’s over the weekend that many leading analyst advises to buy the pullback in PTON!—- Or the outlier BMO analysts who’ve always posted the lowest price on PTON— who reflects your personal “perma-bear” confirmation bias”?!
Shorted 500 at 101
"The Q4 2021 Bike sales Gross Margin is now -9.5%On the call, ""Treads, which currently carries a lower margin than our Bike portfolio.""So PTON is expecting to LOSE money for Very Long time!"

Funs over. Going back to pre covid levels.
@Pumper Pete ”!”!Did Peloton PROJECT that they would lose $1 PER SHARE in Q4 (2021) and if so can u show me that projection?Because you seem to post that they projected something in 2022 BESIDES more massive LOSSES???\\Clarify exactly what u spew?
Institutional buyers are giving ‘Neutral’ ratings to PTON in order to prevent a rapid collapse of Peloton stock price. Hmmm….talkative means that a few institutions can get out now before a stampede starts!
Does anyone know what the retention rate of the monthly subscribers are?
The best catalyst for PTON is when everyone goes back to work and corporate world starts buying machine for workers to have a place to workout. It’s coming.
"Will Pton Rocket due to Oversold ?Ah, million $$$ question!Happy Trading All."
"i think everyone has to ask themselves the all important question, "" why isn't this stock trading at $36?be patient, we'll get there."
"For those analysts who desperately went on air to upgrades or maintain price targets right in front of this deteriorating material facts:Quote unquote:Other conflict of interest:"" Loop Capital Markets expects to receive, or intends to seek, compensation for investment banking services in the next three months from PTON."" In other words: Pay-a-ton pays these talking heads to go publicly help them pump and dump its stock.LoLThese days anyone can be a financial analyst, to be honest."
"@AndreJ5267:You evidently never tried the “Innovative PTON” boot camp with weights that’s a beats of a winning workout that everyone in treadmill industry is trying to copy, but; they’ve all “fizzle flopped” because they don’t have a “globally connected community” — with the best trainers in the world to deliver this kind of innovative content to rival PTON!—- Why do you think PTON Tread has an 85 NPS score at launch today?"
Who shorted after $pton ER?
Look YOU ain't gonna make a difference- trying to persuade people to sell.So save your time and Chill  out and relax.You been working too hard!
"PTON is burning through Cash at an astounding rate! $1.1 BILLION in One Quarter!!!Q3 2021 - ""we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity and have additional liquidity in the form of an untapped $285 million credit facility.""Q4 2021 - ""We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash in liquid assets and have additional liquidity in the form of an untapped $285 [m]illion credit facility."""
"Looks like the anticipated floating of the stock price today, as a result of the Tread finally being available for purchase, was short lived.No more positive catalysts any time soon. But we do have a Bike+ price reduction to look forward to.And the more time PTON's results, financials, and expectations are examined, the more the stock price will go down."
ALL these exercise machines ALWAYS end up outdated and thrown in the corner after a couple yrs. Fad. Nothing more
@FF what is you position after earnings?? ( not trading position) but opinion on the company.
If they are losing over $1 BILLION per year in CASH and have NO CHANCE (according to themselves) to earn a PROFIT in the next 2 years --HOW will they survive? They dont have the cash---
"The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have subpoenaed Peloton for documents relating to its reporting of injuries caused by its products, the fitness equipment maker said Friday, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is launching an investigation into the company's public disclosures of those incidents. In May, after resisting for weeks, Peloton recalled all of its treadmill products following reports of numerous injuries and one fatality."
Peloton insiders
The analyst slashed this overvalued stock down to $45 PPS .
"Here's the trend as I see it:1) Due to the Pandemic, membership for gyms and Fitness center has decrease entirely2) Fitness Center such as Planet Fitness, 24 fitness and other regional centers closed many location, they have reopen some, but most closed permanently3) Most people continue to workout at home4) Fitness equipment makers continues to capitalize on the Fitness craze which got more popular since the late 70s and 80s5) Fitness equipment makers Do make commercial equipment as well as for home use. So the opportunity for Nimble Equipment makers are Huge!"
