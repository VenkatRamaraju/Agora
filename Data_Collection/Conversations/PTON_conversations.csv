"let it play in pre market , we all knwo it will go to 85 today"
Workouts per sub down 22%. How long until people cancel their subscriptions?
"@PTON Insider Sales LLC I have several of Buffett’ stocks in my portfolio because, I agree with the Oracle, however, I’ve developed my own investing style over the years that naturally diverges from his — because my investments are logically more age appropriate for me in my lifetime!—- You are so irrational with an obvious subpar— “critical thinking” skills!"
"Will Pton Rocket due to Oversold ?Ah, million $$$ question!Happy Trading All."
Dropped to where it was beginning this week. Lmao thats the best you bears can do 
LOL going to $80 in 2 weeks !!!
I see shorts are very active here today. I guess it’s time for me to pick up a few shares. I use the Peloton app to spin several times a week and it’s the best out there. Their instructors are second to no one. That monthly fee is well worth it to me especially since I still don’t feel comfortable heading back to the gym and probably never will.
There is a new biking technology where you can actually see other people riding next to you and you also feel the wind blowing. It's called Real bike!!
"Can 1 LONG-WRONG explain what happened to $1.1BILLION IN CASH that was lost between Q3 and Q$ (2021)? ITS GONE, disappeared. We know that Peloton lost over $300 million last quarter but that leaves $800 million in cash unexplained...Was that used to cover prior expenses not reported in Q3 to make that quarter look HOT? SO INSIDERS COULD SELL more shares at higher prices?LAWYERS SHOULD LOOK-SEE"
We’ll see double digits today .
"The launch of the new Tread on Monday is a massive and major expansion of Peloton. As they said on the conference call, the opportunity is ""2-3x the bike category"" and they already have an 85 net promoter score!Note that Peloton is expecting only ""a very small contribution from the upcoming launch of Tread in the US and resumption of sales in the UK and Canada."" This could be the biggest product launch in history, and all the bears want to talk about is how PTON is basically behind a quarter in the launch, due to the CSPC issues. Good luck shorting a company that was already growing at over 100% and now is launching perhaps their biggest product ever!"
Peter putting his frustrations into music…..August 26! August 26!
"Got Woke, Going Broke. If I was a shorter, I'd be all over this."
"Looks like the anticipated floating of the stock price today, as a result of the Tread finally being available for purchase, was short lived.No more positive catalysts any time soon. But we do have a Bike+ price reduction to look forward to.And the more time PTON's results, financials, and expectations are examined, the more the stock price will go down."
this is likely going to close below 100 today. more pullback to 90-95 by Friday and then some rebound next week.
This could be your last chance to collect > $100 per share.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5BqpvcWuyo
If they are losing over $1 BILLION per year in CASH and have NO CHANCE (according to themselves) to earn a PROFIT in the next 2 years --HOW will they survive? They dont have the cash---
PTON is bringing its Basic Bike Model to “The Msses” with yesterday’s announced price reduction of $400!
Did I read that right? 2500 for the new tread? WOW these are going to fly off the shelves LOL
"Here's for investors that are interested what Actual Analyst's Rating on PTON:1) Scott Devitt has $140 target initiated 8/27/21 he has a 131.60 % return on PTON2) Justin Post has a $138 Target initiated on 8/27/21 he has a 78.50% return on PTON3) Aaron Kessler has a HOLD on PTON with 98% return on PTONso if you folks do your DD, these are top Analyst covering PTON that has HIGH success and Return on their investments.Now sometimes a relative unknown Analyst will throw out a number that is way on the UP Side or Down Side such as BMO today. Why? they just want to be in the PUBLIC EYE with their name.-Hey it's just their opinion right?Happy Trading!"
I know two people who bought pelotons during the pandemic.... Both don't even use it that much anymore. Waste of money IMHO
Peloton board of directors together with top management have failed shareholders while unjust enriching themselves….
"""Investors Might Be Losing Patience With Cathie Wood’s ARK FundsSince the end of June, investors have pulled a net $2.7 billion from Cathie Wood's six actively managed ARK ETFs."""
Buying Peloton now is like going outside at “basketball size HAILSTORM” as management gets “ FINANCIAL STATEMENT REINSTATED “ most likely you will not survive
"This is a wonderful triple play !!!! How the institutions kept this above 100 on Friday is a proof of how controlled the stock market is in many stocks, including this overpriced on hit wonder. Two if you count the very danger out treadmills. But the triple play is amazing !!!! Peloton, the maker of exercise treadmills that have been recalled due to injuries, is the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. All three want in on the action and have subpoenaed documents from the company related to how it reported those injuries. I hope the hold the management team responsible since they arrogantly blew off the safety concerns seriously raised by theConsumer Products Safety Commission. $35.00 stock soon."
GOPRO PART 2
ExtraBABY and his other usernames relying on a yahoo board to help lower stock price - the funds will ride this to new all time highs - similar to when you bashed moderna at $105  #PTON300
Finally!!
how is this thing actually going up in pre market????
"Are any pro-PTONers waiting for a 'strength' product from PTON?It's here! The new Tread! Don't believe me? This is what Foley said on the Q4 2021 Earnings call:""the Tread ... it is also a strength platform of sorts.""So, if you are expecting something else, sorry, there isn't anything else."
"How is this company not bankrupt, or the executives not in federal prison?"
"The more they sell, the more they lose. What’s the point"
"Pumper Peter  ---What time are you and your ""babe"" popping the cork on the Dom for #235?That is correct---NEVER"
Cogent case for being short:1) Market cap too high for exercise equipment maker (See NLS);2) Inflation hit hard and will continue to hit hard;3) Interest rates going up and Pton increasing debt load;4) Cash position went from 2:1 to 1:1 Cash/debt;5) Never turned a profit since 2012;6) Margins crushed and hard to reverse;7) Tech stocks generally overvalued;8) Management INSIDER SELL SELL SELL;9) Bike sales declining;10) Treadmill has bad margins.11) CHURN in this business is brutal;12) Marketing expensive;13) NO MOAT and new competitors in space every month.
The analyst slashed this overvalued stock down to $45 PPS .
Peloton had 10x more revenues than NLS 2022 peloton guidance 5.4 Billion 2002 NLS guidance $1. Billion So peloton will stay stagnant while NLS will continue to growing!!
"Honestly, for as bad as a miss this is and the bad guidance, I expect this to be down a lot more (5.5% as i write). Plus price cut would imply poor demand to me.Plus this material weakness in inventory??? I'd expect a crash."
"And as anticipated 10000 times, will hold the $100 mark. Only to break through severely from institutional AH trading"
"Let me get something straight zoom beat earnings, and analysts downgraded the based on revenues MAY BE SLOWING.” Peloton revenues tanked missed all estimates, being investigated from SEC to the SUPREME COURT…. And analysts said the stock is a BUY??? Are you kidding me??? LMAO!!"
@Peter Can you tell everyone what is the difference between revenues and profits?? I have a strong feeling you can’t tell the difference!!
You can enjoy a 30 minute or 60 minute spin class BUT a 30 minute or 60 minute jog is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.
"FROM FORBES!Dodgy AccountingAuditors uncovered a flaw in Peloton’s books. As CNBC wrote, “An audit of fiscal 2021, which ended on June 30, discovered a ‘material weakness’ in the internal controls that govern Peloton’s financial reporting [for inventory]. It will not, however, result in the restatement of any of its past results, the company said.”OUCH!!"
Peloton desperation. Step right up folks! A $400 price drop.
"LOL--This is how its done...Nautilus (NYSE:NLS), for example, just reported a 62% jump in quarterly sales, primarily on the strength of its own connected fitness equipment under the Bowflex brand. It was able to report net earnings of $0.43 per share"
"If the Street couldn't give ZM a break, why would it show mercy for PTON?"
Notice how PERMA-PUMPER Pete has stopped talking about buying the dips and GIFT HORSE trading---That is because he KNOWS this company WILL NEVER EVER have a profitable year meaning any share you buy will never produce anything. You may as well buy Bitcoin---Neither this nor BTC has intrinsic value or risk. Just BAGHOLDING rights
"It’s definitely going up, anyways my investment in stocks and crypto are really doing well especially crypto despite the fluctuations in the current price "
This company stated that its original business plan FAILED and now they are changing it....WHY stick around ? Why not sell and buy back when the new plan is in place and PROVEN to work. Otherwise you are investing ON HOPE...of a proven FAILURE
What a great run. $99.10 all the way to $103. Don't mess with us retail investors. We don't care about evaluations.
Cheers 
Once Peloton goes belly up repairs will become virtually impossible to obtain. Solution?-the blast furnaces to make new Nautilus equipment.
"I love that PTON’s Exceptional Mgmt Team did not pull any punches — they told investors right out the gate the their “total focus” was growing and expanding their “hyper growth global business opportunities”, and not profitability at this time!!*** So, their $253 million profit was reinvested into expansion and growth, and that’s why I invested in the PTON business.—- You have a choice if you re not a growth investor. — but, there is no competitor in the pure fitness sector that’s even close to generating PTON’s type hyper growth revenues, and look for more PTON disruption with the Tread launch on Monday!— It’s quite a certainty that most investors sold and left based on the honesty and blunt frankness of PTON’s Mgmt on that the opening statement— which I found quite similar to AMZN’s mgmt Team during their CCs at an earlier time on their “hyper revenue growth phase”!"
I heard about PTON the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Hey everybody. Don't worry abut those Bots. They are program to SPAM boards.Today more then any other era, you got to think outside the box to OUTWIT AI and their bots.Just outwit them!Happy trading!"
I wonder what’s the obsession with “ 100 Million “ from this company…. They pledged $100 to anti-racism$100 Million to employees betterment100 million subscribers 2025 $100 million to expedite bike delivery100 Million PROMISES!! Out of those 100 million promises 0 realized….
"Pro-PTON people suggest PTON is geared toward overweight people losing weight and becoming healthier.Just one problem with that IDEA ... ""The Tread is built and tested for users between 4'11"" and 6'4"" in height and between 105 and 300 lb in weight.""Did you catch that? NOBODY over 300 lb should use PTON's Tread. Oooops! Guess THAT theory just got Negated by PTON themselves."
ExtraBaby must be one of those $AFRM shorts 
Peloton top management….. everyone that got crossed signed a contract with Peloton for a bike and 12 months of subscription…..  That explains why “ LA MIGRA “ got involved!!
PTON is ready to bounce off its current bottom!!
At the end of the day it’s an exercise equipment seller. Not a tech company
REALITY--THERE IS ZERO UPSIDE in this stock in 2021 and 2022. Its GOING DOWNWHY not BUY lower and BUY back when Peloton has PROVED themselves?
"This company couldn't really earn money during a once-in-a-century pandemic. It's literally an app, a fitness bike and a treadmill. No lock-in of customers. They will reach profitability at some point, but the stock is simply too expensive right now."
"Here it is……Tread going on sale 30 August in 3 countries and a 4th later in the fall. Holller!!!! “Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) announced the all new Peloton Tread will be available in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom August 30, and will be available in Germany in fall 2021. The new Peloton Tread combines Peloton's award-winning content and quality design with safety features integrated into the experience to create an efficient and engaging total body workout experience.""Our goal is to be the go-to fitness solution and the largest and safest home fitness brand in the world,"" said John Foley, Peloton's CEO and co-founder. ""We've worked hard to make sure the new Tread truly earns its spot in Members' homes. We'll always continue to innovate our hardware, software and safety features to live up to our commitment to Member safety and to improving the full Member experience.""”"
The problem for Peloton is this among many--THE $1 Billion in Marketing ALSO HELP the 20 COMPETITORS as people start to SHOP and PRICE SHOP.Competitors will ride the FREE ADS and EAT market share
Wondering if $BODY is the better buy over $PTON?
The initial reaction after earnings was surprise and a quick collapse to the low 90s before the bottom fishers believing that the issues presented on the call would be short lived and that the stock would recover. That happened with the stock getting up to 106 to 108. The price cut will be hard to make up for and the rosy prediction of much higher sales of new machines is just a projection and not to hang your hat on to support a stock that is clearly under stress.....Sell or hedge your bets now.
@Peter What does your BABE says about Peloton DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY bribery charges??
"If you look at the last 4 quarters, Peloton earned $.62 per share non-GAAP. That’s technically a year (4 consecutive quarters) although not an entire FY. I ask again, how much do you think peloton will earn for their upcoming 4th quarter that will be released tomorrow after the bell?"
After dropping to $97 in after hours buyers come in and take it back over $100.00
The type of stock you leave to your kids in 20 years and have to apologize for
Now you have the SEC and Lawyers all over Peloton books….. the chances of something popping up….. 55% downside on stock price is not unrealistic…..
"You folks had plenty of warning to get out a while ago, but you wouldn't listen.Are you listening now?"
"It's not about how happy some current members are with their peloton. Yes there will always be some members sticking with Peloton for a long time. Heck, I remember these 20-year-old PC games like Starcraft II or Diablo II that at their peak, there used to be millions of active players online, now still thousands playing them even though their servers had shrunk by 99%.The thing is not about how crazy some members are with Peloton or how much they love Peloton no matter what. The thing is more will leave Peloton and few will want to join in the future.The trend is down and back to fundamentals (roughly < 5B at current market environment, further downward pressure in tighter economic environment)"
Wow….just wow. PTON is 80% owned by institutions???? Unreal. Is there another stock owned by that many? I’m curious. The shorts on this board are so toast in the long term.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Just came to this board to get a good laugh from all of the drama between shorts and longs 
$300M loss last Qtr. Sell.
Don't mind those Spammers. They are Paid to spread FUD! Now if you guys want to make $$$. Look closely at what's happening!Do your DD. It's not about being Right. It's about making$$$
Who is gullible enough to believe PTON's FY 2022 Expectations?Q1 Outlook: $800 million total revenue2022 Outlook: $5.4B total revenueHOW In the world does PTON expect to generate an Average of $1.533 BILLION Revenue for each of the three remaining Quarters of 2022?
"Who thinks peloton will beat their earnings estimates? And if you answered yes, do you also believe they will be profitable for their FY2021? Many shorts on this board have stated many times that peloton will never ever have a full profitable fiscal year. Let’s see the answers. Thanks."
Institutional buyers are giving ‘Neutral’ ratings to PTON in order to prevent a rapid collapse of Peloton stock price. Hmmm….talkative means that a few institutions can get out now before a stampede starts!
I work at Westfield. Retail locations have been informed to start closing. SELL SELL SELL.
"Large fund(s) just bought over 500,000, 200,000, and another 300,000 shares in PTON back to back. We won't know until tomorrow but large buy orders coming."
"August 2021, Moshe Genack and Xingqi Liu filed verified shareholder derivative action lawsuits purportedly on behalf of the Company against certain of our executive officers and the members of our board of directors. The Genack action alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as a claim for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934The CEO WILL BE IN PRISIN SOON!!"
"For traders. Good trading! Well done!For Long term Investors. Don't make a mistake and sell, this is an opportunity to accumulate PTON that will go up Significantly in the near future."
I hate to admit it but it looks it’s headed for test at $80
Peter investment strategy of CANSLIM!! Buy the stock before institutional investors are fully invested!!! Well they are fully allocated….. and Peter started his CANSLIM
@Peteram a very playful and fun loving person — I never doubt that!! Unlike your stone pal John you are actually really FUNNY!!
PT $300+
Can you explain on financial terms where you said management reinvestment of $253 million is the reason for their losses??? Management reported a NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW LOSS— INVESTING CASH FLOWS IS A TOTALY SEPARATE part of the cash FLOW STATEMENT!!! Please advise now!!
remember bowflex?
2 Words mark the Quarter.. GET OUTSIDE
"@AndreJ5267:You evidently never tried the “Innovative PTON” boot camp with weights that’s a beats of a winning workout that everyone in treadmill industry is trying to copy, but; they’ve all “fizzle flopped” because they don’t have a “globally connected community” — with the best trainers in the world to deliver this kind of innovative content to rival PTON!—- Why do you think PTON Tread has an 85 NPS score at launch today?"
Tread launch on Monday and will be a HUGE sales hit to take the PTON global juggernaut to the next level of growth!!!
Foley is trying to pass off the Tread as PTON's 'strength training' offering. Seriously???
When is the good news coming?
Should be around $50 if even that.
You would have to be an absolute nimcompoooop to believe that PTON will have over $5 billion in reveneue next year....with no pandemic they will struggle to have 3 billion. This stock will CRATER. GROWTH is OVER!!
"@Extradebaby2009 What ?snake oil??????? I am simply long and strong in the the global PTON juggernaut business, that?s poised to deliver more growth in the second half of its current #$%$2022 ? with yesterday?s launch of its PTON Tread, creating a new revenue and profit revenue stream for years to come!???*** Plus, Tread is being introduced on the wings of a lofty 85 NPS which is greater than every competitor in that business sector!??"
2012-2021 --NEVER had a profitable year2021- Pandemic year---$0.69 LOSS of Earnings per share2022---GUIDED to more MASSIVE LOSSES2023---HUGE LOSSES2023---BANKTRUPTCY?
Back to new all time highs in no time!! #PTON300
"@AndrewJ Talking about VIGILANTE  LMAO!! was cheering the fact that PTON closed well above $100""- This guy must be insane.The stock price only closed $0.19 above $100, and he calls that ""well above"".AND, the stock closed DOWN $1.29 So if he describes $0.19 as ""well above"", how does he describe -$1.29 ?"
"Peloton is a revolution in home exercise and not going anywhere. Up 24% on subs, settlement with child's family imminent, more accessibly priced bike, covid not going anywhere. Easy hold. GLTA"
"Word on the street is, Sell into Cathie Woods' Buying."
A market cap of $34 billion which is 7 times this years revenue and they will never make money again. Only in America. This is a $15-20 stock with potential bankruptcy in five years or mess
This company is not looking good for the future imo. I tried to warn you all a month ago. Beachbody is coming out with bodi live coming out right around in the corner in september. The beta is being raved that its better and more engaging then Peloton. Their myx bikes are selling 30% higher then they estimated. So peloton definitely has some very serious competition. And from what it sounds bodi live is going to be better. Long term I don't see how they wont lose customers that move over to beachbody thats a lot cheaper to use with more content as well.
The problem with subs--Tread IF U LISTENED closely is that they said 50% of sales will be to current bike owners so your subs wont go up because they have subs. Then for YOGA and WEIGHT you dont need a bike or tread--You can just get a $12.99 sub per month and get the content.That $12.99 sub is AT COST. $40 sub has 67% Margins which is good but equals the $13 sub w/o hardware.SO you got a problem ---Who will pay $40 for NEW SUBS?
@Peter Warren Buffett says when the stock is cheap BUY…. And when it’s expensive SELL…. Management is selling?? What should anyone deduct??
"The local Peloton store is a ghost town. I saw people everywhere shopping, at the restaurants, walking around but absolutely no one was at the Peloton store. Peloton sales are dropping off a cliff."
"Just went through my 9 peloton friends to see last 30 day activity… only two of them have rode AT ALL in the last 30 days lol. Texted two of my buddies, both pauses subscription during summer months (as did I). PTON going to face headwinds. Just another exercise equipment fad"
"After today’s — earnings missed, — tomorrow SEC investigation, — Monday lawsuits trails starts— Peloton management will approach Peter and  2 failed PUMPERS AND SAY;"
"Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products and services, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our Members. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.That’s where DHS is looking!! LMAO!! Nice!"
I stayed quiet so I could greedily buy some at $100 lol but $103 works also - you know Wall Street is going to run this to new all time highs
When Apple launched its Iphone I dont recall a Billion $$ ad campaign--I recall 1 Steve Jobs 1 grey pants 1 black shirt and him holding IPhone at a news conference...PRODUCT SOLD ITSELF
I guess @Peter just admitted that he was a victim of management fraudulent misleading reports…..
"If y'all look at the charts, its almost set up for the exact same pattern from mid April to the low of 83 and change on May 6th. At that time, we didn't have all the knowledge that we do currently. While they are doing their best to create an orderly exit in here, a solid breach of 100 does not bode well and I don't think the big boys want to be folding deck chairs on the Titanic..."
"So, Big Boys taking away all those stops, Next they will bring this Up-Won't be all surprise to see an UP day for PTON.As always, just my opinion as I see it"
Peloton management once the DOJ and DHS issued subpoenas!!!
W and PTON are crashing down .The pandemic stocks are out of favor .
"Sitting on $1B of inventory lol.. if they were smart, they would sell Peter some shares right now at +$100 vs next quarter when they need it and can only raise at a $20B valuation lol"
"@Peter. So basically Peloton is now a IRS section 501 charity giving away exercise bikes and treadmills below cost? But wait a minute….I thought stocks, earnings and profits were for viable growth companies?"
"See top statement on PTON’s conf. Call?“We will prioritize building and expanding its global community over profitability”!!!!*** Amen to that!!!- I totally agree and support that strategy -/ like, I did with AMZN!!!"
When peloton slashed its bike price $400 they pretty much gave 12 months of free membership that means if a member canceled within 12 months the company lost tons of money!
STRONG BUY!!!!
"Hey Foley:Just keep lowering the price until you're profitable! Maybe throw in a free Nook! Yeah, that'll work! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
"Get back in there and Sell, Sell, Sell!"
Upcoming Pipeline List   : Australia salesStrength product Wearables / watch Rowing machine Nutritional products More healthcare partners More corporate wellness partners Adidas Apparel update And so much more   #PTON300 #BULLISH 
Tons of buyers coming in. People are eager to get a piece of these MEGA profits and declining growth. Can’t blame em.
They have $1 billion of bikes in inventory and can’t sell them so they have to give them away at less than cost
They had some interesting insights about PTON on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"So PTON will finally launch their Tread; of course, we all knew this day would come.And along with the news, the anticipated emotional spike in share price as a result.Should we expect a big boost to Revenues from the Tread? This is doubtful for several reasons:1) PTON's Tread+ was first released in January 2015, recalled in May 2021, and about 125,000 were sold during that time; that works out to about 20,000 per Year, which is an Extremely Low % of treadmill sales.2) As can be observed from the article portion below, overall treadmill sales soared 135 percent during the pandemic shutdown (nowhere near as much an increase as for stationary bikes); thus, just like stationary bikes, both demand and order fulfillment were accelerated forward, and just as PTON stated in their Q3 earnings call, expect demand to retract back below pandemic-influenced levels.3) Being that PTON had gained such notoriety, so their Treads' safety issues became widely known; so, common sense dictates that this negative stigma, even though a 'fix' was applied, is still expected to play a factor when anyone is contemplating which treadmill they decide to purchase.Bottom line is, this is positive news for investors; however, regarding company Revenues and earnings, I do not anticipate much to be added.(Washington Post, By Hamza Shaban, January 7, 2021)""“As soon as the lockdowns took effect, the home-fitness business took off like wildfire,” said Matt Powell, vice president and senior industry adviser for the NPD Group, a market research company.Americans spent heavily across all price points, from $3,000 cardio machines to $20 yoga mats. They also hit the running and hiking trails in earnest — Yellowstone National Park recorded its busiest September and October on record — and embraced other outdoor activities to escape the monotony of stay-at-home life.Health and fitness equipment revenue more than doubled, to $2.3 billion, from March to October, according to NPD retail data. Sales of treadmills soared 135 percent while those of stationary bikes nearly tripled"""
BMO analysts just drove the stake on PTON — JNK HEART  ….. bye Peloton see you in bankruptcy
Peloton reported 2019 — 95% cardio— 5% strength2020 — 60% cardio — 40 strength 2021 — 45% cardio —65% strengthNow any SMART top management would notice the trend moving towards strength and away from cardio…. Only to think  “ let’s come up with a strength machine “ — but no they double up on cardio make a treadmill that is actually worse ( LMAO ) and still doesn’t have a strength training equipment 2022 — bankrupted
"Two facts for people thinking about investing in this company Peloton(PTON): 1) PTON is run by salesmen and saleswomen, and PR people.2) PTON is not a genuine high-tech company the insiders trying hard to make you to believe. They make low-tech exercise machines that contract-manufactures in China, Taiwan, and anywhere in Asia can produce for less than US$100 apiece. They snap on a iPad like monitor on the machine and load it with contents that you can easily find in YouTube and other fitness websites. And not to mention they charge you a steep monthly fee for it. ."
"For those analysts who desperately went on air to upgrades or maintain price targets right in front of this deteriorating material facts:Quote unquote:Other conflict of interest:"" Loop Capital Markets expects to receive, or intends to seek, compensation for investment banking services in the next three months from PTON."" In other words: Pay-a-ton pays these talking heads to go publicly help them pump and dump its stock.LoLThese days anyone can be a financial analyst, to be honest."
What it’s like lifting the new 450 pound Peloton Tread+ and trying to move it.
Funs over. Going back to pre covid levels.
PTON the stock is down close to 60% compared to S&P in 2021. And now comes the rest of the year AFTER bad news...GET OUT now...
"They lost ($313 million dollars) and you're still here? No, I am not short I just wouldn't own this."
Hey . You cannot escape me. Cannot delete my post!You need to Relax.Nobody cares what a Bot Says!Lost your teething Ring!
Who is buying this stock after that horrible quarter? Obviously there were buyers on Friday otherwise this stock would be well under $70. Seems like the growth story is over. CNBC just puts positive spins on their results even though they are horrible. Was it just institutions buying to not take a hit on options trading. Curious what is going on behind the scenes.
Management sold billions worth of stock and shareholders are on the hook to pay for their legal troubles…. That bag just heavier!!
Cathie woods bought 500k shares at 102….. so in the spam of 4 hrs she lost $ almost a million Dollars!! LMAO!!
"This management is so full of technology??? LMAO!!Moreover, while the market price of the common stock of many “” technology “”companies have fallen significantly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trading price of our Class A common has increased."
"People, like Steve Ballmer, used to say iPhone is just a toy, a fad, too expensive..."
Peter looking at PTON financials
ALL these exercise machines ALWAYS end up outdated and thrown in the corner after a couple yrs. Fad. Nothing more
"Extradebaby2009 I am a very playful and fun loving person — so, I was cheering the fact that PTON closed well above $100, and the indications are present for a the strong rebound tomorrow, or later into the weekend — because PTON spent most of the session in the green, and the base formation held given that PTON revisited its previous morning bottom below $100 and bounced back above!**** Remember your early studies of the CANSLIM Method from William O’Neil?—- PTON rally to the upside is imminent!!!"
I was never a believer in this concept and its not Cheap
"Debt rattle of financial desperation from Barron’s-“Peloton (PTON), the hot maker of interactive stationary bikes, issued $875 million of five-year convertible bonds earlier this week with an interest rate of zero and a conversion premium of 65%—the highest for any sizable new issue in the past year, according to Michael Youngworth, the head of global convertibles strategist at Bank of America Securities.“"
in 52 weeks Nasdaq is up 50% ---Yeah we will get a small correction soon. Its coming....Petere has never seen one since he has only 8 years experience...I have been through 1999-2001 and 2007-2009 and I will tell you that they are relatively short compared to the good times before and after bullmarkets...I dont foresee a large one due to world market growth and liquidity BUT I do see a small one when foreclosures and evictions are allowed. And Banks are paid to lend and 10 yr yields go to 2% ...Then JUNK companies that have NO earnings and NO future profitability get HAMMERED like the renter who bought a Peloton instead of paying rent because of a Covid crisis.
How many of you still own a thigh master? THOSE ARE THE FUTURE OF EXERCISE! LOL Sound familiar?
Peter  ( snake oil salesman)
They lost 313 million in one quarter!
By committing Accounting fraud Peloton top management misleads investors to buy shares of a company and believe their earnings the stock was priced based ON FRAUDULENT NUMBERS MANIPULATED BY management— since it’s all fake management should give back all their unjustified compensation!!! Yet the BOARD OF DIRECTORS JUST APPROVED 19 million extra shares to be compensated to top management…..
Can any LONG-WRONG give the case for staying invested in 2021? 2022? Why not sell and buy back WHEN Peloton has turned it around?
Company lost a dollar a share.
The best catalyst for PTON is when everyone goes back to work and corporate world starts buying machine for workers to have a place to workout. It’s coming.
You know who had a STORY stock? THERANOS
@Pumper Pete ”!”!Did Peloton PROJECT that they would lose $1 PER SHARE in Q4 (2021) and if so can u show me that projection?Because you seem to post that they projected something in 2022 BESIDES more massive LOSSES???\\Clarify exactly what u spew?
"Once a stock goes over $100 on the way up or under $100 on the way down, historically speaking, it continues to go in the same direction until something changes it's fundamentals. PTON has way too much negativity right now and is un-investable from a historical pattern of downward momentum. Don't fight the charts or you will get burned."
ALL of pton products are made from parts outsourced to China.
"Anyone out there that isn't just trying to hype or short the stock? Seems hit or miss depending what stock you're looking at. my attempt at a price target, with their annual subs forecast pace it looks like they would hit 5M subs in 2 years, if we assume their new fiscal margin guidance on hardware stays the same and this last quarter is an avg hardware revenue (some will be more some less) I came out with $34B cap Aug 2023 (that's assuming a or of 20). That seems all fine and good, about 15-20% annualized return BUT my biggest concern: diluting stocks. They seem to be fine with diluting stocks for growth - maybe it's the right call in the end but it might make more sense to still wait closer to fy23 when they claim to be EBITDA positive before buying in. I'm no expert, thought I'd share in case any likeminded folks have similar figures or things I may not have considered"
As SHORTS have said —there is no good news for Pton once pandemic is over
"Spammers are still out in FORCE! Meaning good trading! Resistance still $117.91 short term Support at $99.96.I would say PTON has a chance to bounce back to $105 -$107 near term.Again trade accordingly, Just my Opinion as I see it."
"i think everyone has to ask themselves the all important question, "" why isn't this stock trading at $36?be patient, we'll get there."
"An audit of fiscal 2021, which ended on June 30, discovered a “material weakness” in the internal controls that govern Peloton’s financial reporting.CARE TO SPLAIN?"
"Finally some real numbers UBS Cuts Peloton Interactive's Price Target to $70 From $74, Citing 'Lower Margin Guide;' Sell Rating Kept"
NOT 1 single LONG-WRONG can explain HOW Peloton can fix their margins when they are broken? They point to AFTER 2023 but HOW? You are giving away the tread at costs and bike at BELOW cost and with SUBS at $12.99 your margins on subs are at 0.00%------ITS a CHARITY
Who was the guy here blasting #$350 by Sept/Dec? Haven't seen that for a while.
@Extradebaby2009: That information is posted at PTON’s Investor Relations module at their One PTON website!— Go read the corporate earnings report if you can pal!
PTON has a lot of SAM (Smoke And Mirrors)
The stock market is a tool to transfer wealth from the impatient to patient - warren buffet #BULLISH 
Bike price went from $2495 to soon $1495The ONLY WAY this company make money EVER is with MARGINS that can support profits...THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO ZERO!!
@Extradebaby2009:PTON’s Tread was launched yesterday into a 85 NPS!!!— Please don’t go having “conniption fit” now!

If you read on lawsuits section there is a derivative action lawsuits!! That’s some wild siht…. That’s what happen when there is no corporate governance!!
"I don't understand why longs keep their fingers crossed hoping for another pump and dump by the funds.The Fed is about to change direction, treasury about to expand their balance sheet (as soon as they raise debt limit again) for those spending bills they are about to pass.This will put downward pressure on long term treasure and boost interest rates.Funds will have to adjust their portfolios accordingly because excess capitals are getting increasingly expensive.High-flying multiples with broken growth prospect will get abandoned.Quality growth, cyclical and values will be loved.That's what's coming in the economic and capital environment.Don't be bagholding the wrong list.It's not worth it.Put money where the smart money is headed.Glta"
Peloton’s latest earnings bellyflopped.
"@ExtradebabyI love that PTON’s Exceptional Mgmt Team did not pull any punches — they told investors right out the gate the their “total focus” was growing and expanding their “hyper growth global business opportunities”, and not profitability at this time!!*** So, their $253 million profit was reinvested into expansion and growth, and that’s why I invested in the PTON business.—- You have a choice if you re not a growth investor. — but, there is no competitor in the pure fitness sector that’s even close to generating PTON’s type hyper growth revenues, and look for more PTON disruption with the Tread launch on Monday!"
"I always heard PTON benefitted from the pandemic and lockdowns.But when I review their Earnings from Revenues during the pandemic, it looks like PTON actually suffered; why?When I look at ZM's numbers, it makes sense; but PTON's numbers, no sense at all. It must be a difference in management."
NLS nice margins Solid business model No accounting issues Great products Profitable Great acquisition candidateTRADES LESS THAN REVENUES!! That’s is bargain waiting to be acquired…
"At your request, as your counsel, we have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-8 (the “Registration Statement”) to be filed by Peloton Interactive, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) on or about August 26, 2021 in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), of the issuance of an aggregate of 18,008,827 shares (the “Shares”) Management will dilute and destroy more value to shareholders unchecked because of peloton POOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE….."
How is the RED candle chart looking today?
2022 (fiscal year)$1 Billion AD campaign$1 Billion loss of earnings---This will add up to BANKRUPTCY in 2023?
The PTON global Tread will be a KEY parallel growth driver over the next 3to 5 years!
My jaw dropped at the company's valuation and I have a $35 monthly gym membership that I use every other day. I have no idea how they on Earth will generate the net cash inflow over the life of the company unless the products are popular worldwide but then again I can say the same for many other tech companies. Makes me nervous holding these type of shares.
Peloton insider’s future.
So in April peloton announced the recall after HIDING THE FACTS FROM THE LAW stock went to $78 Today the recall still stand and now they announced accounting fraud stock should go to $35
You BUY PTON for GROWTH - this is not an “old smoke stack industry business at the tail end of its life cycle”!!!*** Applying smoke stack industry metrics to PTON is not in the cards!!!*** They told the Market and investors that right out of the gate at the Conference Call!!!
"Read this... Litigation, regulatory proceedings, such as the investigations described above, as well as related personal injury or class action claims and lawsuits, and securities and intellectual property infringement matters that we are currently facing or could face, can be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict,"" the company said in the filing."
Before you buy a Peloton Treadmill you better call Progressive!
@Kow LMAO!! Hilarious and spot on!!! They can spin anything and talk a bird down from a tree.
On the conference call they said that tread will be bigger than their bike!!!! Wow. The next 2 - 3 years are going to phenomenal.
"Told ya.. every time. People load up at $100, then it runs into the $105 range and the institutions will dump heavy during one of the AH sessions to push it through the $100 support. Exact same as after the recall"

HEY LONG-WRONGS---Foley and Peloton said that the high price of Peloton hardware was a built in CHURN PREVENTERRecall that logic? Now explain what lowering that price 50% means?
Nordic Track-SAFE and proven treadmills now selling at Costco for $799 each and a free one year membership with interactive trainers. Compare that to Peloton’s new and abused treadmill story.
"What makes me scratch my head is analysts saying that: “ selling Peloton is equivalent to selling Apple Before the iPhone. Peloton STOLE a concept from SOUL CYCLE and mixed with another concert that a tiny segment of SPINNING ENTHUSIASTS cared ( HOME FITNESS) — then by a struck of extreme LUCK, 7 Billion humans were forced/locked home. Then all of a sudden, Peloton is the new Apple?? LMAO!! After all, the company's growth is very questionable given the accounting fraud."
"Today marks the start of a new and ginormous PTON revenue stream with the launch of the PTON Tread in the I.S., Canada, and the U.K. — The Tread is being launched into a strong and receptive markets where it already sports an 85 NPS score.— Plus, PLUS, this launch comes on the heels of PTON’s announced $400 reduction for the price of its original Bike model.- It’s no wonder that PTON’s Mgmt guided for higher revenues than analysts projections in its current FY-2022!"
Added shares 
This is going to touch 90s soon... Pretty much going to feel the pressure of all WFH stocks especially ZM that's down -15%. Depending on how Sept goes... I wouldn't be surprised if we see this in 80s too.
So growth is supposedly over according to bears when the company only has one product released and barely expanded internationally 
BMO said market cap was based on ALL SUBS staying for the next 26 years...LOL
just to name a few corporate partners… ADIDAS - NASDAQ - WAYFAIR - SAMSUNG - UNITED HEALTHCARE - AND MANY MORE TO COME!! GENIUS!!!
Zoom tanked after hours after beating earnings analysts mentioned that Zoom growth MAY BE SLOWING…. And the same analysts says Peloton is a buy!!! LMAO!!! Hilarious!!!
Just funds taking retail shares to run it up  #PTON300
Buying a $100 Peloton share buys you future dividend streams...LOL when they GUIDED losses until 2024 you will get nothing but downgrades and FUTURE LOSSES...ADMITTED by PTON itself
Oh I hope they talk about the strength product!! We need one for our gym but at least the tread will be here soon to add to our bike 
"Can someone explain Foley's statement, ""the lower-priced Tread as well allowed us to consider lowering the price of B1""It sounds like he is trying to make up an excuse, but never actually does."
"Anybody want a $2,500 unicycle contraption sitting in their living room for the next ten years, unused? Haha fad stock.. takes two stimulus checks of $1400 to get on gargantuan unicycle contraption, and those checks are drying up."
Who shorted after $pton ER?
CNN chyron reporting PTON legal issues and investigations could not be more ill timed for the launch of the new Tread tomorrow. How many people considering a new treadmill will choose a Peloton after seeing that?Only saving grace is CNN has a relatively small viewership.
@ Extradebaby Not wit PTON’s 94 NOS score!!
Today opening $122
I am getting a kick Toying with Baby Bot
"Kathie Woods is still buying…..bought almost $12 million worth yesterday. If you think you know more than Kathie, get bent. If mama Kathie is buying, that should be all you need to know for long term growth, profits, and free cash flow."
Once the Trust is Gone everything else soon Follows .....
It’s fun to watch Cathie woods buy while shorts cry  #PTON300
"MORE from Forbes!!When Peloton went public, I was concerned about CEO John Foley’s voting control of the company. Bloomberg noted then that he gets 20 votes to every regular investor’s one.With the slow drip of bad news — such as the DOJ and DHS investigations into Peloton — that voting control means it is far more difficult for shareholders to replace Foley than it was for regulators to spur Peloton to recall its treadmills."
"Since growth is gone, prices of equipment will continue to decline as better machines sell for much less, what is left here? Anyone who can afford their overpriced cheaply made equipment has bought one. The market is totally saturated. Even at 1,800 a bike it is still 400% overpriced to better equipment. The only people making money on this overpriced stock is all the insider sellers. I suggest that PTON begin selling life insurance for user of their equipment. The payouts will be huge but they have to do something to justify this outrageous valuation. Peloton just hit the wall and it is going to be all downhill."
"Peloton repot45% of workouts 2021 were cardio compared to 95% in 2019 NLS Sales of strength training equipment have grown 500% while cardio sales dropped 30% Now that is a company positioned right for the trend…. Trading at an exceptional discount!!! This company has no accounting issues, no lawsuits pending, no DOJ, DHS, SEC on their neck!! And trades bellow revenues!! ￼"
Shorted 500 at 101
Why was my previous post about DHS deleted? Strange
"We might going to have a dead-cat bounce here at this 100 psychological level by day's end.Never underestimate those slick insiders in Peloton(PTON).They are masterful salesman and saleswomen, and skillful PR people. They can spin anything and talk a bird down from a tree.This grossly over-priced stock will drop like a rock eventually , but not straight down.."
Why did peloton jump at 5pm?
"Peloton will miss Q1 revenue and guide down further when they report in late October or early November. Because Q4 revenue still included orders placed in prior quarters that they were yet to deliver. The demand has dried up to a point that it's even below pre-pandemic level (because they reached peak growth and brand recognition during the pandemic and lockdown that majority of potential customers willing to purchase one have already done so) Adding to increased expenses (which they use as means to funnel money out of the company), increased competition, saturated market, decreasing interest and engagement (again, due to back to normalcy and the fact that only a fraction of users will keep the habit of exercising regularly), the company will have to find more distraction (things like they have announced recently - the so-called overseas expansion, or more partnerships with big brands that they pay, or new fluff products that will never be as successful as their bike had been).However, these old schemes and game will no longer be effective to prop up its share price. As the Fed changes policy direction, funds adjust portfolios accordingly to overweight value/cyclical/quality growth names. Pton will be traded like its competitors that a 50%-90% drop in its market cap from current level is warranted."
Peloton financials says that the company will start manufacturing their bikes in the US — at the PRECOR manufacturing site. To re tool PRECOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES will take about 18 months…. So I guess another lie from management!!
"Bears were crying wolve when the stock was trading at 80 a couple of weeks ago due to the treadmill problems. Now, treadmill is fixed and stock trades way above 80, even after supposed bad earnings."
"'Globe' already posted 40 times today alone (so far)!When factored across one year consisting of 50 weeks, 5 days each week, that would amount to 10,000 comments!According to his own criticism, he must be a paid pumper."
I bought one for my mother in law few months back and she loves it so far.
This is simple---Peloton ADMITTED it lost over $1 per share in a PANDEMIC QUARTER when all the wind was at their back. Their BUSINESS MODEL is BROKEN. SO now they are changing it but they are still stuck with BROKEN MARGINS and as we all know---you can not earn profits until fixed. Peloton also ADMITTED they will not fix margins ----They hope they fix themselves in 2023....LOL.This is a CHARITY case--a NON PROFIT
"This is an exciting time to be a peloton share holder. More hints for more global expansion: “A new job posting gives hints towards Peloton’s global expansion plans. It would seem we can look forward to seeing Peloton expand into France and/or Spain in the future.The new job posting, first spotted by @OCshree on Twitter, is based out of the London office. The job title was originally for for a “Senior Analyst, Readiness (German, French or Spanish speaking)”, but was recently renamed to be “Operational Lead, Fit Out (German, French or Spanish speaking)”. In the job posting, Peloton mention they would like someone who is multilingual: “fluent in both English and one of German, French or Spanish””"
Does anyone know what the retention rate of the monthly subscribers are?
"More possibilities wrt to at home innovative equipment. More firsts from peloton will be coming in 2022: “Multiple signs seem to point to Peloton working behind the scenes to develop a voice interface (including a voice search) for Peloton hardware products. This would likely start with the Peloton Bike / Bike+ & Peloton Tread / Tread+, but could eventually expand to the Peloton Rower and/or a Peloton Strength Device (Focus or Platform). This voice interface could potentially be used in a number of ways (all of these are speculation) – from allowing users to quickly search & pull up classes from a certain date, or all classes from one coach by just asking Peloton. This type of voice search capability seems like the most likely starting point for voice technology in the Peloton products at this time. However, many other features would be possible using voice. Once the pause button is added you could pause the class by voice too. It theoretically could also allow for members to adjust resistance during a ride, speed during a run, or similar settings during a row or strength workout.”"
This is starting to get to crazy to just be some kind of a coincidence. Anything I buy goes down and anything I short goes up. Has happened wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too many times in a row to be a coincidence. This isn't possible. No matter what I do. Sounds like PTON might be in some trouble? Guess not.
@Along:How will subscription revenue decrease with launch of PTON’s new Tread and the increase in sales of Bikes from the $400 reduction in price????—- Shouldn’t the opposite — HUGE increase in subscriptions revenues — be the case ?*** Where did you study ECON-101 — supply demand — and FINANCE-101?
"They are trying to affect the trading algorithms in AH with their exaggerations and “auto- Bots” all the way to 8PM EST AH trading close!!!*** Check out their “exaggerated and targeted language” — it will get more crazier, if the trading doesn’t go their way into the 8PM close!- Their aim is to drive PTON stock into negative in AHrs!"

The SEC will be also investigating Analysts that fail to include in their upgrades the lawsuits the company and risks associated with the litigation Pretty much resuming the party is over!!
"Here's the trend as I see it:1) Due to the Pandemic, membership for gyms and Fitness center has decrease entirely2) Fitness Center such as Planet Fitness, 24 fitness and other regional centers closed many location, they have reopen some, but most closed permanently3) Most people continue to workout at home4) Fitness equipment makers continues to capitalize on the Fitness craze which got more popular since the late 70s and 80s5) Fitness equipment makers Do make commercial equipment as well as for home use. So the opportunity for Nimble Equipment makers are Huge!"
"That full-year guidance makes some assumptions that are a little hard for me to get behind. Peloton is banking on strong demand for its bike products across all regions, fueled partly by a price cut, a successful relaunch of its treadmill products following a recall, and continued low churn for its subscription products."
I am truly stunned that ANYONE is actually buying this stock.
@Peter @jonh What’s going on here are you 2 smoking together?? Because neither of you are making any sense!!!

@Extradebaby2009 You mean the article in Barron’s over the weekend that many leading analyst advises to buy the pullback in PTON!—- Or the outlier BMO analysts who’ve always posted the lowest price on PTON— who reflects your personal “perma-bear” confirmation bias”?!
What a bloodbath today for the longs! Hope the trends continue next week.

Bingo! Up she goes. Just trade em!
I added a whole bunch of shares today!! Ordered a tread!! And we’re going to beat earnings and nothing would make me happier than wearables / strength product to add to my gym 
"Let's say Pton get 3 million subs at 500 per year which is $1.5 Billion ---That would be $1 Billion in profits. SORRY---ITS NOT ENOUGH. Peloton loses 10-20% of subs annually AND we BET that likely another 20-30% are on PAUSE, WAIVERS, or TIME OUTS....You still go out of business. $1 Billion is the ad, sales and marketing campaign...With Peloton GIVING AWAY their bikes at likely $200 per unit loss this company is TOAST.The fight to KEEP members will be too much. By lowering prices and the 0.00% financing you may get less committed members. Members who FELL for YOUR GIMMICKS...They wont be loyal over time. Sorry..."
If you had invested $1000 in PTON December 2020 today you would have around $600 while management sold $700 Million enriching themselves while you lost most of wealth

@FF what is you position after earnings?? ( not trading position) but opinion on the company.
"The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have subpoenaed Peloton for documents relating to its reporting of injuries caused by its products, the fitness equipment maker said Friday, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is launching an investigation into the company's public disclosures of those incidents. In May, after resisting for weeks, Peloton recalled all of its treadmill products following reports of numerous injuries and one fatality."
Time to BUY!
"Oooops! PTON missed updating some pages of their website.Under ""BIKES"", clicking 'Shop Bike', then clicking 'Compare Bikes', the old $1,895 and $49/MO for the Bike is still showing.So PTON's web development person couldn't do a search and find this?Makes you wonder how Last-Minute the decision was to drop the price?"

Long $pton this is an investment . Lower margins for the short term to increase margins in the long term. Also it’s always been about the hardware to software transition . I also believe the sales are proven in the treadmill
PTON recovery rally is in full session after bouncing around on a bottoming process in the first 45 minutes from the opening bell.
