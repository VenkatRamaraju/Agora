"a day of relief for long, an opportunity for institutional to clean their books, I am betting PTON will be around $70 in 15 days.."
Market UP! Pton DOWN!
Peloton has guided for Q2 (2022) which is Oct to Dec at $1.51 Billion which is 300 million more than their record best which was Q3 (2021)---LOL. There is JUST NO WAY NO HOW this JUNK gets close to that ....WILL THEY GUIDE DOWN SOON?
Andrew—if u look at some of the articles about analysts and their premium pricing for PTON they all had a theme and it went something like Peloton would need to execute their guidance flawlessly to keep their price—that is why Q2 guidance at 1.5 billion in revenue is the key to their entire valuation…
Will be back to $100 very soon
it was up after hours to 87 when someone talked it on TV...lol
"@Next Bust will come-It sounds like Peloton’s profit will eventually, if ever, only come from licensing out its name to T-shirts and leggings. Have fun taking on Lululemon, Under Armor, Adidas and the others. The renewed expansion effort into apparel signals desperation."
I’m up $3 grand already on my $85 purchase. That will more than pay for my next Peloton spin bike. Thank you Peloton. 
A Slippin' and a Slidin'! Can't get no Traction! Repeated Failed attempts at $100 are eroding hope and confidence! The Only things keeping this Stock Afloat! The USS Juggernaut is Sinking! Man the Lifeboats! All Hands on Deck! Foley and Management First!
"Say you have a new investor, never invested in stocks before.What is the argument for buying PTON stock, as opposed to buying any other stock?"
"There are so many things Pton could have done to stay relevant. BUT they thought they were better than everyone else. AND now things don't looks so good. SO I bet they are already putting out Buyout feelers before things get any worse... WHAT is the ultimate value of this Company? A stationary bike and a bit of 'technology' A name that is inexorably tied to Bicycle Racing, NOT Rowers, NOT Treadmills, NOT Yoga. HERE'S my scenario: $85, 75, 65, 50, 40, 30.... AND we're back to IPO! TWO thumbs down."
"while its a decent upmove on the day, the lack of volume is worrisome... Adding a few 85 weekly puts at this level and testing the afternoon pullback into the close... Will add to them if it heads lower."
as always underperforms to upside when market up underperforms to downside when market is down....zzzzzzzz
recall Blue Apron was trying to tout itself as a tech company lol
The smart money didn’t fall for the bs report. LolBk in 3 years
Peloton Headquarters atmosphere on Monday morning October 4th. CYA or you will be SOL.
Peloton’s new focus on wellness includes getting a good night sleep. I’ll bet I know what their next acquisition will be! Soon Peter’s mugshot will be gracing this screen.
I like owning PTON puts.
"Looks like PTON is goona ride the wave of all the positive bank earnings. Might burn me on my weekly puts, but will use any real pops to keep adding to my Nov 15 and jan 22 puts.Remember the stocks that are rising are showing positive earnings, growth and cash flow- none of which PTON has..."
This stock has been red every day since 9/13 (except one day up for 19 cents) . LOL we might see 50s with the speed we are going.
David --LULU is profitable and not losing a $1 billion per year to stay afloat. Peloton is losing $1 billion per year and is guiding to lose money until 2025. At which time they will break even IF and ONLY if they hit 5.6 million PAYING SUBS ($40 subs) ---That means they have to hold on to their current SUBS and add over 1.3 MILLION SUBS PER YEAR which is pandemic growth numbers each year for 3 straight years...LOL aint happening
Game over for PTON it can’t hold 84 with strong market .
"Article from InvestorPlace:Why It’s Time to Walk Away From Peloton Interactive Stock""Making an investment in Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) made sense when the Covid-19 pandemic first struck and home exercise equipment was in high demand. And indeed, PTON stock holders profited handsomely in 2020.However, that was then, and this is now."""
"HEADWINDS are a comin'1. Inflation; (input costs such as labor/shipping etc UP)2. Inflation; (consumers have less money to spend on exercise equipment)3. Interest rates up: (debt more expensive to service)4. Interest rates up; (DCF model = stock more expensive to own)5. Demand down as GYMS reopen;6. Demand down as competition in interactive equipment space ARRIVED;7. 85 storefronts in most expensive retail malls in country;8. 9000 employees;9. 3 factories (Taiwan, Ohio, Precor-NC) for few products;10. Terrible management with massive insider selling;11. it's an exercise bike w/ a screen and cable box;12. More churn over time;13. LOSING MONEY for next 3 years and likely longer;14. Fitness fads fade--see history from start of time"
The stationary bike company is not moving...
Pton recommendations are
"Market wants this to be below 80. They are either going to push this down soon or wait for earnings. Have been saying it since Aug. We will see 70s before we see anything higher. This cant even break 88. This remind me of 130, 120, 110, and 88. Next week be 80."
I heard about PTON the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Last chance to get out before the whole thing collapse.IMO
I added more at 89.12. It’s a gift.Short squeeze has run it’s course for the day .
"I feel the ONLY reason the stock price has not crashed down to at least $50 already, is because PTON is a member of the Nasdaq 100, Russell 1000, Nasdaq Composite and Russell 3000"
"Want to know why you buy PTON? Women love it. Men also starting to realize it’s a great product. I use their strength training classes more than cycling. Yoga classes are good too. Can’t beat the convenience, the data/tracking/metrics. I haven’t renewed my gym membership. My GF just dumped her Lifetime membership. The recent price cut will attract more users, more subscription/recurring revenues. And you know what else? At anytime PTON can choose to require additional users on a bike a fee. Think of it like family plans in mobile phone biz. They have an EASY lever they can pull at anytime and gain substantial revenue with zero cost output. Their apparel will take off too. I see LULU losing some apparel share to PTON."
Never a good sign when you are struggling at the highs of the day and volume keeps decreasing...Looking for a retest of 80 by the end of the week.
Laughing at the shorts here. PTON will be trading at $350 in 12 months. Already up nicely on the Oct 15 $90 calls I bought yesterday. Still think it finishes above $90 this Friday though.
"Congress hasn’t resolved this Debt Ceiling FIASCO…. And are talking about spending $3 Trillion??? Yeah, I can see tons of people lining up buy US bonds to pay for infrastructure"
@David — Can someone tell this individual that LULU IS PROFITABLE… and the value of a company derive from the present value of its “future cash flows “ …. What’s peloton future cash flow??… $0 [ actually negative!! ] “ For the bashers..if you think PTON is overvalued..compare to LULU. LULU market cap $54B on $4B rev. Yes. They are making money and PTON not yet. However PTON at $26B market cap or just over 6x sales and LULI trading at 13x sales?
I read a pretty interesting piece explaining the reason of market volatility is not much this “DEBT CEILING FIASCO” but one bigger problem boiling under the surface— the FED nomination…. This paper explains that; “ there is a huge probability J Powell may NOT be nominated and instead a much more aggressive FED gets nominated causing a much bigger pull back in asset prices” — definitely something to watch for…..
"most people are going back to the gym, running biking outdoors"
"It's funny, in the latest MF pumper article ""Is it time to buy Peloton"" it's filled with if's and could's. ""If the company succeeds"", ""which could help bring new members"", ""Peloton could fit that bill""Even the MF is reduced to ifs and buts. Like the rest of these longs, that's all they have to hang their hat on...hopes and prayers"
"What will matter ultimately is Peloton missing their $808 Million revenue mark....If they do, its LIGHTS OUT!!"
Stationary bike company with a screen...lol
Hold off on a Peloton acquisitions as the purchase price may be slashed in half by Christmas.
"Remember when there was talk of PTON establishing a corporate footprint in Ireland?So much for the lower-tax benefits they were anticipating; from today's WSJ:""A global agreement to set a minimum 15% corporate tax rate cleared its last major hurdle Thursday afterIreland, a LOW-TAX country that is the European headquarters for some of the largest U.S. tech companies, said it would join the overhaul effort."""
"""Peloton Interactive Inc. Stock Underperforms Wednesday When Compared To Competitors5:18 pm ET September 29, 2021 (MarketWatch)"""
This can drop to $45.00 there saying
First time ever buying PTON. Technicals don't lie
"Q3 2021: ""Lastly, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of liquidity""Q4 2021: ""We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash in liquid assets""What happened? How do you burn $1.1 BILLION in cash in three months, with nothing to show for it???"
Congratulations ExtraBaby you win!
Going to see 40s now. May be 27-30. All due to COVID. Stay AWAY
"Analysts said: “ The cost of doing business for Peloton are going up, both on the content side and the hardware side. “ [ yet he has a $120 price target?? ] — go figure… the company margins are already decimated on top of their lower price…"
And yet another down day for team Peloton.What is a fair valuation of this company?The stock chart looks like GoPro's did at the point it completely imploded.
Added shorties at $86.60---just a few---will add more on the way up
According to Yahoo! Finance 28 Analysts cover the stock 7 — strong buys 14 — buys 5 — hold How can it be possible that all 28 “ experts “ are completely wrong!! LMAO!!
"This announcement is about to be published, and the stock price drops over a point on increased volume; not a good sign:""NEW YORK, Oct. 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peloton Interactive, Inc.

The Company will hold a conference call to discuss results at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) that day."""
YOU can BANK on 3 things--If/when Pton misses their revenue target they will blame 1) price decrease 2) tread visibility and 3) compare the quarter to Q1 in 2019....
iFit pulled out of public offering?? That’s strange!! — Looks like another fraud was about to hit the market….THIS WAS A BAIL OUT IPO!!
Peter Peloton’s last gasp.
Cathie Wood bought PTON shares when it was over $100 a share. Check out the Yahoo article.
"PTON bikes are good, but in general, people maintain a workout plan for a very short amount of time until they get burned out and busy, one skip day leads to two which leads to a week and then a month. This stock will absolutely implode when you start seeing used PTON bikes on Craigslist and Facebook for sale."
Peloton soon to disappear…..get a Harley instead.
Under 80 this week?
There should be some news soon from Peloton. You know they are working behind the scenes to bring new equipment offerings to members. Next news release will really move the stock and I wouldn’t want to be short when that happens. I’ve said many times that now is the time to go long and accumulate shares.
Between 2 competitions (none other than Apple and Amazon) - Pandemic is OVER....down back to 40. If lucky. Clothing supply chain issues are more serious now than ever. They can't compete with existing apparel folks that are in competition. Little too late.
"From Wikipedia-“A technology company is an electronics-based technology company, including, for example, business relating to digital electronics, software, and internet-related services, such as e-commerce services.” So what is Peloton? Basically, an exercise bicycle company with a subscription service. It is NOT a technology company."
All the stars are lined up for the big market correction/ crash . IMO
"Wow, Kathie Wood just added more shares of PTON last Thursday."
"Zacks""Bear Of The Day: Peloton (PTON)""Read the article for yourself; no need for me to add anything."
"Given how the 80 level seems to be holding up, this may be worth a VERY short term pivot for a few dollars to the upside, before they flush this thing out to new lows.Any indication of solving the deadlock in congress on the budget, and the market snaps back like an elastic band taking everything with it.However.The smart institutions stuck with this will unload any chance they can. As I said last week, I don't think you see 90 ever again..."
What wood doesn't float? Cathy's ARKK wood? :)
Are we really headed below 80?
"looks like an earlier post didnt make it when the ""interweb"" was struggling.Bought a few 80 calls when it didn't retest the low of the day. Think we get a small dead cat bounce to 85- especially if there is any type of relief on the economic news front. On any bounce I will resume short term puts and add again to long term puts; institutions will use any bounce to get out of this and continue selling calls to offset bad positions.I see ZERO reason they get this above 90 barring some REAL fluffed up talk of a merger etc."
I’m up almost $1.50 since my limit order filled at $85 this morning. I have several other GTC orders in place in case markets sell off. I’m a very patient investor. GLTA Longs!
"@ Next bus will come So much for ""$100 in hours"". We're in this for the real valuation ~ $45TIMBER!"
Even thou I haven’t traded PTON in while…. in my opinion this stock will have another run up to the 90s before the next leg down towards $30….. — management reported all the garbage last earnings together with law suits and accounting investigations— now I think they will report pristine quarter….. any thoughts??
That Key Banc Analyst has has much price power as MDNYA doing his #300
todays action
ARKW is BLEEDING money:https://etfdb.com/etf/ARKW/--what happens is money leaves fund and it AUTOMATICALLY sells all shares off from all shares within fund. That leads to days like yesterday when PTON should be up 1% and it is DOWN DOWN (drip drip)---I also cant find her daily PTON trades in last 3 weeks as I suspect she makes PUBLIC her BUYS but is now not disclosing the daily DRIP DRIP which is MUCH MUCH larger than her splashy HYPE buys!!.\--he ETF power is done. The money flowing in let her make splashy buys which helped her stocks go up and that let to higher share price which led to more money flowing in---NOW DO IT IN REVERSE which is what is going on now
80 and change today. 70's by Friday.
I still believe this will hit 70s before going back up. No real support for this stock and probably crash hard on 11/3 after EC with no real news.
when bikes n treadmills are being discounted $400...time to sell
Short at 88.50See you at 40
"No! NEW products coming!!Jill Woodworth--CFO---""The only other point I might make, Eric, there which I do think is an important one is unlike other fitness equipment companies, we're going to have a very, very small portfolio of products. The way we differentiate the -- our Tread, our Bike is through the content and the software. And every time you get on a Bike or Tread, it's a better experience because of the updates that we have to our software and because of that fresh content that our members get every single day."""
first comes the guilt of having overpaid.Then comes the pain from using the contraption.then it goes idle.then it becomes a towel rack.then it becomes a reminder of good intentions.then it becomes a thing to sell.then it becomes a donation.---The Life Cycle of a Peloton.
"An exercise bicycle company with a resurrected tread mill and a limited niche exercise clothing line. Sound exciting? No, it’s boring. Intuitive stock value maybe $10. That company is Peloton."
What ever happened to Peter? Did he bail?
PTON stock buyers from yesterday...
fwiw pre-market low this morning is 81.31...but need to see this follow through lower in regular hours and at the close.
Another day Peloton getting smashed…. Ouch!!
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!

Peter! Where are you?

And VIrus LOCK DOWN provided PTON with the absolute rocket fuel for BLAST OFF.However, now with the country RE OPENED (gyms) and money getting a little bit tighter PTON has to stand on its own. It can NOT do it.

Let’s see 84 again .lolI’m bought 10 K shares NLS at 9 for a possible BO .
Waaayyy oversold. RSI 14 day at 28. Look for PTON to close near $90 this Friday.
Are there any PTON bills left on this board? Whose still buying this stock?!? Just shorts covering? Peter?
"Can any pro-PTON person here explain to me how the Tread is a 'strength platform'?That's how the CEO referred to it, ""the Tread ... is also a strength platform of sorts""Too bad PTON doesn't have anything as impressive as the Tempo Studio for strength; I'd rather spend $2,495 on THAT and simply go for a walk, run, or climb up and down some stairs on my own."

Its absolutely shameless.I think everyone should read it and understand how they are viewing things, but to not be able to take a macro view and say...""they just came off the greatest period ever for home gyms, and are now moving back to an open society, so there may be some headwinds- especially if tread continues to flounder, and clothes and rowing don't take off as hoped..."""

Peloton head of global is giving an interview on Bloomberg now….
I’ll be taking a position in PTON soon. This company is all about the bikes and instructors and everything else is just noise. Their instructors are the best on the planet and they will turn this thing around. I’ll be building a position from this point forward.

Now I know what its like to be a handmaid- hold PTON
"I think Peleton has solidified its brand and will be around a long time.

Peter is back with his cut and paste PTON schlock again. He finally bought a laptop.
Has everyone lost confidence in this company already? Are we finally going to realize Pton will lose more than half of its existing customers/subscribers by next year? Back to ground zero?Pumpers need to get their act together and give us some bargain puts. This is not cool.
"Revisit the iFit non-IPO. They pulled it due to adverse market conditions. Even NLS, who actually makes money, gets pummeled month after month. I think FOLEY DUMPS is a NLS shareholder. So basically iFit didn't think it was going to raise the capital, meaning they know their IPO price was going to tank. iFit was priced at a revs/cap valuation that put PTON around $55.The question shouldn't be what games are keeping this so low. The valid question is who itf is propping it up so high? And why?"
Pelotonzi Scheme
Sell off will resume today … yesterday was a short covering into a new Q .

Who wants to partner with starting a Peloton Bike recycling company? ;)
Once ppl realize they can get a better and more effective workout (and infinitely more fun) on quest 2 for $300 peloton and others gonna be in trouble.Just got done playing beat Saber for 45 minutes than a round of thrill of the fight. Literally dripping in sweat. Beat Saber is rated equivalent as tennis and that's on much easier songs/difficulty than I play. My hands moved roughly 2000 meters on last song I played. As a tennis player it definitely is better cardio and that's saying a lot.Thrill of the fight is equivalent to a rowing machine... And all of its super fun.
"Looks like they really are gonna try to keep this propped up and maybe retest 90. Based on the volume (anemic) and lack of interest as it rises, followed by increased volume in the afternoon when it sells off, it feels like a coordinated effort to let some folks out.Maybe I'm beating a broken record, but adding a few more 85 weekly puts and will cover only if break of 89.Not adding any more to long terms, but eyeing the Nov 12 70's to add more. (In addition to jan 22 50 and 60)"

I won't be all that surprised if this falls into the $60-70 range by EOY.

November 2020, PTON implied Volatility was 75%, stock was 165, market Cap close to $60 Billion My thought how many stocks have this huge market cap and this Volatility??? ( not many ) then started selling options ( short Volatility ) — with vaccines and more normalcy…. I started betting “ that the volatility will fall…. now to my LUCK volatility didn’t fall but the price collapse….. and it did run out control to my benefit…. Within 2 months the call options I sold were down ( PROFITABLE to me ) by 78%….."

You guys see that Cathie Woods left NYC for St Pete Florida? Just like all 60 something New Yorkers --they all retire in Florida

Wood started selling again.
"When an analyst reduces their Price Target, but tells people to load up; how does that make any sense, unless they have ulterior motives to sell shares to those who they are telling to buy."
‘Johny (Foley) come lately’s’ attempted entrance into the crowded exercise clothing & rebranding itself as a ‘wellness company’ actually implies that its core business of selling exercise bikes with internet lessons will never achieve profitability. Hence the desperate measures to diversify into sweatshop textiles.
I would love to hear why the much-celebrated collaboration between Peloton and Adidas fell apart in less than 6 months.I see Peloton and Analysts don't want to talk about it; just stay silent and any memory of it will fade away.
Key Banc analyst did not hear that CFO says NO NEW products coming--VERY VERY SMALL PRODUCTS PORTFOLIO...NO NEW ROWER
"BYE BYE PTON!!To have LeBron James — one of the greatest athletes in the world — invest in Tonal is a pinnacle moment for us,” added Tonal founder and CEO Aly Orady.Tonal is a digitally connected strength machine that is seen by many as Peloton’s main rival. The company more directly competes with Mirror, the at-home equipment maker owned by Lululemon. Yahoo Finance sister publication TechCrunch reported Tonal saw sales surge 800% in 2020 as gyms closed and people shifted to working out at home."

"Not impressed with the closing action on his given the significant reversal for the overall market today. Really seems to reinforce my thoughts on an organized exit during that big spike in the middle of the day...If this doesn't open much higher tomorrow, or try to retest today's highs, I am very comfortable adding to various puts in play for both short/ long term."
They probably will push this up to 84-85 today . IMO
"Einhorn! ""People have basically given up on critical analysis of accounting. It's not something that anybody is particularly interested in. Companies that have ethics do their accounting correctly. And companies that don't, they don't. There's really nothing that limits that."""
"Letsgo, yes the decline has stopped and we most likely will have a good 2-4 week rally in the market, but PTON will lag, and we both know this is going much lower in the long run. You might offset with software stock calls."
Cathie Wood’s stock picking methodology exemplified…buy Peloton until it’s delisted.
"Just how much is a name worth? What would be a possible buy-out price?PTON only has 3.2M subscribers out of a combined population of 520M people (excluding Australia's 25M)That's only 0.615% of the population! That's right, Less Than 1%, barely more than 1/2%!And they are in a very niche market, so one would not expect that % to grow by much, if at all.Even at $50/sh, that values PTON at $15 BILLION.So what company in their right mind would even pay that much money, to gain the opportunity to sell to only 0.615% of the population?"
"There's no doubt that PTON will continue to move closer to $90 in the short term, but their next earnings report will sink them. Between the bike price drop, treadmill recalls, increasing number of competitors, etc. they have way too many headwinds for this to be worth 30 billion in a post pandemic world."
The last stocks that switched from positive to negative this fast was back in 2007 when banks and home lenders were getting hammered . Boy that was rough. This is looking like that
"To all hater, i suggest u all queue up at Goldengate Bridge to jump down one by one at PTON 200 or you may choose the Empire state building,"
I just read a paper that shows lots of market participants are starting to unload Peloton shares in anticipation on a possible removal of NAS-100 index.
Every time John Foley talks the stock goes down 20%.... Jill is polished and very well spoken. they should just let her talk. Rest of the management are just lost.
"Just to reiterate... The market is on a tear, and PTON is up .50 and I wouldn't be surprised if it finishes negative on the day. Bigger issue- ZERO volume (compared to average daily volume).This is honestly shaping up to be a perfect storm of a drop post earnings..."
Peter has been trying to reassemble his Peloton bike.
Lol. Laughing all the way to the bank on my Oct 8 and 15 calls I bought Tuesday. All the shorts here are sooo wrong on PTON.
"In retrospect, that 20%ish move up from 98 to 116 on Sep 8-10 was the classic bear shakeout before the next break down. Pretty much confirms this stock is in a bear market. It should trade on fundamentals now, while problems will be magnified and the market especially harsh. Don’t be surprised to see this in the single digits at some point. Next move down should be quick and fierce. Am I wrong? Yes, probably."
"I keep seeing more and more competitors popping up. For this company to move forward and do well, I think they need to come up with something truly unique and proprietary that will make it extremely difficult for competitors to gain market share. Their bikes, treads, and apparel are nice, but when I keep seeing similar products being advertised multiple times per week, that's certainly not a good sign."
W just got downgraded to Hold from Buy .Staying at home stocks will get crush going forward especially the overvalued without MOAT.

"NEVER forget that IF you fell for the PUMP that Peloton will soon offer a bunch of new products that when they say ""new products"" they mean things like new ""classes"" new ""features"" on bike and tread NOT new products like rower and strength....Jill Woodworth--CFO---""The only other point I might make, Eric, there which I do think is an important one is unlike other fitness equipment companies, we're going to have a very, very small portfolio of products. The way we differentiate the -- our Tread, our Bike is through the content and the software. And every time you get on a Bike or Tread, it's a better experience because of the updates that we have to our software and because of that fresh content that our members get every single day."""
"Not PTON related, but I just have to share my good fortune news.My largest holding, FLXN, just announced being acquired. :)If anyone has experience with CVRs, any knowledge sharing would be much appreciated (TIA)."
"Breaking below the 52-week low of $80.48 is the target; may not be today, but soon.How much further it falls below that, who knows?"
Took profit in yesterday's weekly 85 puts this morning when it failed to break 81.Will add to long dated puts but being patient right now as they are still really trying to prop this up and prevent a $70 from showing up...
@Peloton ( Junk ) insider trader @Extradebaby2008 Amazon thanks Foley every dayHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! I heard JEFF BESOS is sending Foley to space for “” FREE”” as a thank you note…..
"Host: “ can you tell your investors watching, what is the plans for the future?” PTON: “ usher dance classes “"
like buying an iphone because other members in your family have one...ahhh feel so much better now that you succumbed to the pressure...so original lol
"As we pull out of the pandemic, exercise bikes will be awash on Craigslist and garage sales. Better dump PTON on the next peak...or now."
"This could be setting up as a repeat from yesterday- broad market is being propped up something fierce, and they will try to rally PTON. When it fails, it will sell off and end up negative on the day- possibly breaking back to the 83 level to end the week. Could be a great opportunity to initiate new positions for short term puts expiring next Friday (will add some small 80s and 85s) and adding to my Nov 12 puts which I believe is setting up to be a huge disappointment."
They had some interesting insights about PTON on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"How many popular instructors left PTON for competitors?""With the Myx Fitness merger, Beachbody can offer live cycling classes on its BODi platform taught by none other than former Peloton instructor, Jennifer Jacobs. May 19, 2021"""
"Personal guess is we bounce between 83-90 before earnings. Although, wouldn't be surprised to see it pop back up and fail at the 103ish level again. I think we will hit the 60-70 level after earnings. Everything points to another terrible quarter."
"How much in total do you think PTON will need to refund back to those who bought a Bike that was delivered on or after July 27th, within the 30 day window of the 2021 $400 price drop?Mind you, this will be applied to the upcoming Q1 2022 results."
"Believe it or not Levi Strauss is getting into the ""fitness clothing and subscription business""...come one, come all we can LULU too :-/"
For the bashers..if you think PTON is overvalued..compare to LULU. LULU market cap $54B on $4B rev. Yes. They are making money and PTON not yet. However PTON at $26B market cap or just over 6x sales and LULI trading at 13x sales?
Peloton's logo on their apparel will become the new 'Quarantine' identifier.
