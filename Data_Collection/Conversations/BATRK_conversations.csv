BATRA is down 8.02% to 18.69
Will be interesting to see what BATRA does when we finally get word that the baseball season will be played (even if it's an abbreviated season). We know the nation is starved for live sports... that's for sure. I'm guessing we find the stock back in the mid 20's by late summer... just a hunch ~Go Cubbies!
Buy more BATRA before a billionaire buys it ....Load up
What is the difference between BATRK and BATRA?
Liberty Braves is up 6.49% to 27.08
"Market placing too much value on real estate part ... problem is 1/2 of the baseball season team is on the road, and rest of the year place is empty. It just doesn't look like a place one would go for a meal or bar drink without a ballgame!"

Good news for longs. This is a value play - not an earnings play. Deal for the Mets Makes Liberty Braves Stock Look Attractive - Barrons 9-15-2020

"Check the ticket prices. After the first few games (with astronomical prices), they drop like a rock ... to the point where they almost start giving them away. I take that as a bad sign!"
BATRK is up 7.46% to 16.70
Picture of stadium looks like a minor league ballpark ... hard to believe best players will want to play there. It could be hard to make good trades.
BATRA is down 9.16% to 17.65
Chipper Jones just signed on with the Braves as a hitting instructor. This will help the stock price tomorrow. up 2% today.
batra will drop below $25 when many sports events pull out of ATL in protest of their absurd new laws restricting voter rights. The threat of larg scale boycotts is very real. This could have a serious impact on Batra earnings.
what is going on ...this team is a trophy for someone .......the whole thing with stadium is worth 2 billionand Gabeeli is a big holder and he knows his stuff...so at loss to know what I am missing
Some billionaire will by the Braves. Not many trophy assets available. Good place to park a couple of billion for a few years...... a no brainer.

Which shares of Liberty Media own the Braves? Is it both symbols?

"I have been invested in this stock for a while now, I am a current full season ticket holder (10 Years) coming from the Ted, and this may be my last season with them. No customer service from the new staff, no parking, and traffic nightmares from I75 and I285. Yeah its only 10 miles as the crow flies to the new stadium but that will be 30 mins extra in traffic. I'm living on the SE side of ATL and it takes me 20 mins to get to the old stadium, and now my drive will be 50 mins... Also all the Braves marketing is all in the NW side of ATL. The people from COBB Co are footing most of the bill for the stadium that they didn't want in the first place. The only future I see for the Sun Trust park and the Braves is a sale in the future. The season ticket holders I know are all buying Hawks and Falcons season tickets, because of the better customer service and not having to deal with the traffic nightmare up there."

I read that BATRK owns the Rangers and the Knicks as well as the Braves that can not be true can it ? What has Magic Malone buried the evidence. This is under valued by at least 600M on the Braves alone.

Malone unloaded shares of this and Liberty C-shares; Berkshire Hathaway bought Liberty C-shares. Malone reportedly unloaded 28k shares of Liberty Braves for about $23.85. Berkshire probably bought the C-shares because of an interest in Sirius.
"Malone is getting Live Nation Entertainment ready to transfer 34% ownership of Ticketmaster into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff of Sirius XM. Paying off margin loan early so that he can start moving assets. Iheartmedia should come out of Bankruptcy next month which will also be moved into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff.

You can look at the Atlanta traffic maps on the Internet. Looks surprisingly clear. Either traffic to the ballgame isn't a problem or ... no one is attending?
Great volume today. Might be the start of an uptrend?

"BATRK appears to be a long term BUY under 17.50. Fair value is reported at 19.21. I've bought a starter position today (400 shares) and will consider buying up to 4000 shares...at lower prices. This is a very long term (5-10 years plus) investment and not a quick trade.It is very unusual to be able to buy into a MLB or NFL team/franchise with less huge net worth. However, the value of teams like the Braves have significantly increased over the last 10-20 years. With the new suburban ballpark and surrounding facilities, win or lose, investment in the Atlanta Braves could be a terrific long term investment which IMO will not track the general market. Yes, BATRK is public; however, again IMO, true value should be amor like a private company. Most likely, this value will be realized either by price increase or a buyout. I plan to just buy on down moves, if any, and not really follow daily."
