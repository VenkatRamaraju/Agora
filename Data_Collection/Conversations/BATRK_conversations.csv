batra will drop below $25 when many sports events pull out of ATL in protest of their absurd new laws restricting voter rights. The threat of larg scale boycotts is very real. This could have a serious impact on Batra earnings.

Will be interesting to see what BATRA does when we finally get word that the baseball season will be played (even if it's an abbreviated season). We know the nation is starved for live sports... that's for sure. I'm guessing we find the stock back in the mid 20's by late summer... just a hunch ~Go Cubbies!

"Malone is getting Live Nation Entertainment ready to transfer 34% ownership of Ticketmaster into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff of Sirius XM. Paying off margin loan early so that he can start moving assets. Iheartmedia should come out of Bankruptcy next month which will also be moved into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff.

I read that BATRK owns the Rangers and the Knicks as well as the Braves that can not be true can it ? What has Magic Malone buried the evidence. This is under valued by at least 600M on the Braves alone.

"BATRK appears to be a long term BUY under 17.50. Fair value is reported at 19.21. I've bought a starter position today (400 shares) and will consider buying up to 4000 shares...at lower prices. This is a very long term (5-10 years plus) investment and not a quick trade.It is very unusual to be able to buy into a MLB or NFL team/franchise with less huge net worth. However, the value of teams like the Braves have significantly increased over the last 10-20 years. With the new suburban ballpark and surrounding facilities, win or lose, investment in the Atlanta Braves could be a terrific long term investment which IMO will not track the general market. Yes, BATRK is public; however, again IMO, true value should be amor like a private company. Most likely, this value will be realized either by price increase or a buyout. I plan to just buy on down moves, if any, and not really follow daily."
Mid season and 18 games out
When Atlanta Braves team will be bought by some billionaire? Any clue out there?

You can look at the Atlanta traffic maps on the Internet. Looks surprisingly clear. Either traffic to the ballgame isn't a problem or ... no one is attending?

"I have been invested in this stock for a while now, I am a current full season ticket holder (10 Years) coming from the Ted, and this may be my last season with them. No customer service from the new staff, no parking, and traffic nightmares from I75 and I285. Yeah its only 10 miles as the crow flies to the new stadium but that will be 30 mins extra in traffic. I'm living on the SE side of ATL and it takes me 20 mins to get to the old stadium, and now my drive will be 50 mins... Also all the Braves marketing is all in the NW side of ATL. The people from COBB Co are footing most of the bill for the stadium that they didn't want in the first place. The only future I see for the Sun Trust park and the Braves is a sale in the future. The season ticket holders I know are all buying Hawks and Falcons season tickets, because of the better customer service and not having to deal with the traffic nightmare up there."
