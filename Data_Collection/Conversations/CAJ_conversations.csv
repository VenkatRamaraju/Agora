Watching this stock is like watching grass grow
"My thoughts on Cannon.... Cannon isn't just cameras and printers they recently developed a new CMOS sensor that will be used in self driving car industry. Also the US and Canada both have passed laws requiring backup cameras on all cars. The Auto Industry alone should account for about $1.83 billion in revenue growth for these types of sensors. Also, given that Cannon is sitting on close to $4billion in cash the company will be able to keep making new innovative products without debt while taking a part of this massive sensor requirement and making profits while paying a 5.18% dividend yield. Yeah think I'm buying it.Thoughts?"
Anyone here knows what is a good Canon camera to buy for youtubers?
"I think the winner, between Nikon, Sony and Canon, will ultimately be be Canon. I think there's enough cash to ride out the sell off of the failing DSL camera inventory and enough momentum in the camera software development, OLED manufacturing equipment and digital imaging tech to give this company a bright future. I'm not sure where the buy point is, and it is likely to get worse before it gets better, but this stock is top of my watch list."
