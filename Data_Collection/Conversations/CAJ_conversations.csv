"I feel like cannon is pretty low and has room to go up, however I’m going to trust the analysts and close my position. Gonna do this before lumber prices tank in winter. Also, Unfortunately canon has not caught on the big tech trend and I feel that it will lose to its competitors like Hewlett-Packard and MSFT. Gonna sell, but see where it goes"
The cameras are too expensive ..
"My thoughts on Cannon.... Cannon isn't just cameras and printers they recently developed a new CMOS sensor that will be used in self driving car industry. Also the US and Canada both have passed laws requiring backup cameras on all cars. The Auto Industry alone should account for about $1.83 billion in revenue growth for these types of sensors. Also, given that Cannon is sitting on close to $4billion in cash the company will be able to keep making new innovative products without debt while taking a part of this massive sensor requirement and making profits while paying a 5.18% dividend yield. Yeah think I'm buying it.Thoughts?"
what is wrong with these guys?

"The weakness of the stock price makes no sense to me. It just seems as if the investment world does not care for value, healthy balance sheets, visible income streams or consistent profits. All that matters is ""spin"" and momentum."

"If it doesn't consolidate at 27 in the next few days there's a high chance of a downward reversal and breaking down under 25$. With a 43% fall in yoy profits I don't see investors holding onto CAJ long term. 25-27 looks like a pump, expecting profit taking to start."

"I think the winner, between Nikon, Sony and Canon, will ultimately be be Canon. I think there's enough cash to ride out the sell off of the failing DSL camera inventory and enough momentum in the camera software development, OLED manufacturing equipment and digital imaging tech to give this company a bright future. I'm not sure where the buy point is, and it is likely to get worse before it gets better, but this stock is top of my watch list."
