"I like the influx of recent news. I think there will be some good growth for Canon. And there is still the Canon R1 coming soon, so that should be interesting as well."
"I think the winner, between Nikon, Sony and Canon, will ultimately be be Canon. I think there's enough cash to ride out the sell off of the failing DSL camera inventory and enough momentum in the camera software development, OLED manufacturing equipment and digital imaging tech to give this company a bright future. I'm not sure where the buy point is, and it is likely to get worse before it gets better, but this stock is top of my watch list."
"My thoughts on Cannon.... Cannon isn't just cameras and printers they recently developed a new CMOS sensor that will be used in self driving car industry. Also the US and Canada both have passed laws requiring backup cameras on all cars. The Auto Industry alone should account for about $1.83 billion in revenue growth for these types of sensors. Also, given that Cannon is sitting on close to $4billion in cash the company will be able to keep making new innovative products without debt while taking a part of this massive sensor requirement and making profits while paying a 5.18% dividend yield. Yeah think I'm buying it.Thoughts?"

"Like to buy caj why it is going down any long time investors please shed some light , if dividend is paid in us currency and is there withholding tax on it I am Canadian 71"
"If it doesn't consolidate at 27 in the next few days there's a high chance of a downward reversal and breaking down under 25$. With a 43% fall in yoy profits I don't see investors holding onto CAJ long term. 25-27 looks like a pump, expecting profit taking to start."

"I feel like cannon is pretty low and has room to go up, however I’m going to trust the analysts and close my position. Gonna do this before lumber prices tank in winter. Also, Unfortunately canon has not caught on the big tech trend and I feel that it will lose to its competitors like Hewlett-Packard and MSFT. Gonna sell, but see where it goes"
I am long term bullish on this stock. Does anyone know what the withholding of dividends is in Japan?
Buying here is like a bank account hold and get the div payments every 6 months.. Solid company and this stock will go back up.. They already said they forecast a profit for the year.. Vaccine possibly before election.. Everything gonna go back up
