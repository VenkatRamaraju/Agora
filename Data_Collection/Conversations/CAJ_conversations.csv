Watching this stock is like watching grass grow
Cut dividend. Buy all you can here!
Bought initial shares today.
are dividends payed yearly or quarterly?
"I think the winner, between Nikon, Sony and Canon, will ultimately be be Canon. I think there's enough cash to ride out the sell off of the failing DSL camera inventory and enough momentum in the camera software development, OLED manufacturing equipment and digital imaging tech to give this company a bright future. I'm not sure where the buy point is, and it is likely to get worse before it gets better, but this stock is top of my watch list."
Anyone here knows what is a good Canon camera to buy for youtubers?
The dividend is very attractive. How stable is it?
"Wow, a Canon ball!"
This is a GREAT value. I'm in.

"09/04/2019, 21:19 EDT... Canon shares rising sharply to 2776 yen per share on in the Japanese Stock exchange."
Earnings reported after Nikkei closing: beat estimates on both profits and revenue. Stock was depressed excessively and due for recovery.
Canon is down 6.69% to 23.36
"My thoughts on Cannon.... Cannon isn't just cameras and printers they recently developed a new CMOS sensor that will be used in self driving car industry. Also the US and Canada both have passed laws requiring backup cameras on all cars. The Auto Industry alone should account for about $1.83 billion in revenue growth for these types of sensors. Also, given that Cannon is sitting on close to $4billion in cash the company will be able to keep making new innovative products without debt while taking a part of this massive sensor requirement and making profits while paying a 5.18% dividend yield. Yeah think I'm buying it.Thoughts?"
Who is still long here?
Upgraded to Overweight at JPMorgan.
