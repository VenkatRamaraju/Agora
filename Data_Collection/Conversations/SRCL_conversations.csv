This management continues to do a poor job. How long do you give these guys before you show them the door? There is no confidence in them at all. Economy is flying and all waste companies are doing well except Stericycle.
"Feeling the pain, bought $136.10 trough broker Stifel (steer clear). Fundamentals look promising for SRCL, how to recoup $38,000; lossanother story ."
"Looking at the assets, what is up with over 5 billion in goodwill and intangible assets? That number seems outrageously high..."
"The March 11 conf call includes some really confusing double talk babble. I think it reads waste volumes will increase in 2020 and pricing will be based on discussions w clients.Jeffrey Marc Silber, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior Equity Analyst [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. That's helpful. If I could -- and my follow-up, focus on the RWCS business. It was great to see the 2% organic growth. Is it possible to break that out between volume and pricing? And what do you think we should be expecting for those 2 components in 2020?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cindy J. Miller, Stericycle, Inc. - President, CEO & Director [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks. I think I'll take first stab, and if Janet has any color that she'd like to add. I think as we take a look from a volume perspective, we are -- anytime you're growing organically, you're increasing your volume. And as we realign our resources, and we really try to expand, if you will, a patch of land of responsibility for a sales resource, we are going to see and we should see some volume increases. But I think what you bring -- the second part of the question from a pricing perspective, that's where the deal review committee, that's where the change in comp incentive plans and the focus that we have on rewarding quality of revenue growth, I think that comes with not always just an assumption that it's a price discussion. As we get more engaged with customers from a collaborative and a partnership perspective, we end up having more discussion about the value that we bring. And I think as we look forward to that, that's where I think we're going to continue to see some steady and strong of what we think are solid growth levels as we look out from a long-range perspective. And again, I couldn't be any more bullish on our commercial group and how well they're doing. And as long as I'm giving a plug, I can tell you, I'm very, very bullish on our ERP opportunities. I think that Janet's leadership team and from a finance perspective, I think we're really doing great things there. Cory is doing a terrific job, just overhauling the commercial group. And I've got to give a shout out to Rich Moore and to Dominic Culotta with engineering and operations. I hope it is -- one of the most exciting things I've talked about was the 27% reduction in headcount in just putting in master operating plans in 14 of the facilities, a reduction in 8% of the fleet. And remember, these weren't our biggest facilities. So for me, just more to come there in terms of all of the things that the foundation of the ERP is going to afford us the opportunity to get that much better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
SRCLP reached a new All Time Low at 47.18
Who’s been disposing of all the medical waste from COVID-19 testing? Both the point of collection materials (PPE) and from the test labs? Looking at the market I would assume Stericylce. Anyone know if they have contracts with Quest and or Labcorp? Also who do you think is going to dispose of the waste from the 700 million domestic vaccine shots (2x every American).
"This is reasonably interesting upward movement with no discernible news. Anyone have any thoughts? Not complaining, just a bit atypical for the rest of the market today."
"Itronics Inc. - stock symbol (ITRO) is recognized for saving the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake in Northern Nevada by developing “Zero Waste” technologies. One of the first awarded “International Green Heroes”. Itronics for or over 30 years is utilizing science and engineering to create and commercialize recycling, mineral, and nutrient technologies. Itronics possesses three breakthrough technologies (1) in photographic waste recycling (2) E-waste (Electronic Waste) recycling and (3) Reprocessed Mining Tailings with “Zero Waste”.

Solid earnings for the first time in a long time. Here's hoping Stericycle can keep it going. Leader in the space and it's long past due for the stock to start acting like it. Good luck SRCL longs!
"Stericycle's Q1 earnings and 2020 guidance come out 04/30--roughly two weeks from today. They offloaded their commercial hazardous waste business to Harasco to focus on their core competency: medical waste generated by hospitals. All you need do is google, check out the main job finding sites, and you'll see that they are hiring scads of people--and yet they're still more than 33% off their pre-Covid price."
"It won't take much to drive SRCL significantly higher in my opinion. Margins, profitability metrics and free cash flow is finally on an upswing. The wind might finally be at Stericycle's back instead of pushing against it. I wouldn't be surprised to see a huge increase in operating income in the coming year along with further improvement to free cash flow. The company is headed in the right direction and making the right moves for the long term in my opinion. Expect to see $100+ within the next 18 months. Good luck SRCL longs! Anyone that's held this thing for multiple years surely deserves a little luck with this one."
There was consistent selling of SRCL shares over a week to 10 days before the earnings release on November 8th.I wonder who selling the stock knew what about the earnings results before the report was released on November 8th?
Stericycle now rated a STRONG BUY: https://nasdaqnewsupdates.com/2020/03/25/moment-finally-arrived-stericycle-inc-nasdaq-srcl/
"The SA article from a week ago makes an important point that discretionary medical procedures have been curtailed in much of the world but COVID wastes will more than make up for the loss of this med waste stream. I live in a state (Illinois) that just lifted the ban on discretionary surgeries. I believe many states and countries are doing the same. So going forward, I think this discretionary waste stream will return to more normal levels. Some people may view it as the ideal time to have a procedure done since they can rehab at home since traveling is restricted. All this is leading me to consider SRCL an investment rather than a trade on better than expected quarterly numbers.FL"
Who is going to handle the millions upon millions of vaccine vials and syringes ?
"I thought the earnings report and the call were OK. It does seem to me that Cindy and Janet do not do a particularly good job of actually answering questions. Nice to see the stock moving up today after not recovering from the earlier selloff as much as many other stocks. Hopefully SOP prices will continue to trend up; I think they are used as an input for tissue paper etc which has of course grown in volume recently. To me, unfortunately, SOP pricing has a huge impact on profitability for the company as a whole; my interest is more on the regulated waste side. Anyways, good luck with this one."
Stifel has a Buy rating on the stock with a $70.00 target price. Other quality research firms have strong buys also. I am curious why so many on this conversation post have such a hate for the company. Thanks for any intelligent facts or comments .
Saw on Meet the Press that there is a strike against SRCL. I was unaware of it from the news on this board. Looks like Health Care Benefits are a primary demand. The post with the link got censored so you'll have to google it.FL
"NOTE TO THOSE LOSING FAITH: The formula is simple. Earnings follow demand, and times of crisis radically rewrite the landscape of demand ('demandscape'?), and thus earnings. Over the short term, equity markets have a hard time recognizing new demandscapes, let alone anticipating them. Companies specializing in medical waste are about to become as busy as PPE manufacturers (see links I've posted below). With each day that passes, the new coronavirus demandscape will become more apparent to more investors, but it could take SRCLs Q1 earnings report (04/30/20) and guidance to make it universally apparent just how much they are in demand, and the kind of earnings we might expect as this tragedy drags on. I think it'll happen sooner, given the uptick in media coverage."
"I added a little on yesterdays dip. While I'm certain waste volumes will be much higher, I'm leary of any company that does not require full payment at the time of service. A model that doesn't work for waste collection. The health care system is being strained by COVID 19. The virus is hitting poorer areas where the percentage of uninsured is much higher. This will likely put a strain on hospitals and providers so that credit will deteriorate. All this adds up to a high likelihood of existing contract negotiated rates will be renegotiated downward. I felt a bit more secure buying additional shares when I saw that yesterday's relief package included $75 Billion for hospitals. We will have to wait for April 30 to see what percentage of contracts are being renegotiated.FL"
