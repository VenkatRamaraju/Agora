"Sharps Compliance (SMED) reports an operating loss of .10 a share. Though this is bodes ill for Sharps (the average estimate was for them to lose .04), its relevance to SRCL is limited, given that 1) retail sharps disposal, which comprises the bulk of SMEDs business, is secondary for Stericycle, which serves hospitals and has added shifts and new hires to deal with increased volumes of PPE waste, and 2) that SMED shares have doubled in value, while SRCL shares have dropped 33%, in the prior Q. SMEDs release can be found here: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/28/2023151/0/en/Sharps-Compliance-Reports-Fiscal-2020-Third-Quarter-Results.html"

"NOTE TO THOSE LOSING FAITH: The formula is simple. Earnings follow demand, and times of crisis radically rewrite the landscape of demand ('demandscape'?), and thus earnings. Over the short term, equity markets have a hard time recognizing new demandscapes, let alone anticipating them. Companies specializing in medical waste are about to become as busy as PPE manufacturers (see links I've posted below). With each day that passes, the new coronavirus demandscape will become more apparent to more investors, but it could take SRCLs Q1 earnings report (04/30/20) and guidance to make it universally apparent just how much they are in demand, and the kind of earnings we might expect as this tragedy drags on. I think it'll happen sooner, given the uptick in media coverage."
I'm thinking the tick up in revenue on the security information destruction was increased prices for paper sales. The latest news out of China does not look good for paper and plastic exports.
"Bought in this morning. While I'm relatively certain that waste volumes will increase substantially for SRCL, I'm not certain the extent to which it translates into a profit uptick. States are going to be under tremendous financial pressure and may ask for some form of forbearance or discounting of bills. Many contracts are going to be litigated under ""act of god"" clauses. We might not know how this turns out for several months and the bills are paid. That said, I still believe it is worth it as a speculation. This pandemic will not be resolved in a month, SRCL will have some leverage since the hospitals. clinics and nursing homes will need to have the wastes removed promptly or risk new infections. FL"
Management is inept. Junior leaders at the top who have no business in present roles. Overpaid and time to go!

"I added a little on yesterdays dip. While I'm certain waste volumes will be much higher, I'm leary of any company that does not require full payment at the time of service. A model that doesn't work for waste collection. The health care system is being strained by COVID 19. The virus is hitting poorer areas where the percentage of uninsured is much higher. This will likely put a strain on hospitals and providers so that credit will deteriorate. All this adds up to a high likelihood of existing contract negotiated rates will be renegotiated downward. I felt a bit more secure buying additional shares when I saw that yesterday's relief package included $75 Billion for hospitals. We will have to wait for April 30 to see what percentage of contracts are being renegotiated.FL"
heard a rumor about a merger/buyout with WM.... anybody know anything??
Saw on Meet the Press that there is a strike against SRCL. I was unaware of it from the news on this board. Looks like Health Care Benefits are a primary demand. The post with the link got censored so you'll have to google it.FL

"It won't take much to drive SRCL significantly higher in my opinion. Margins, profitability metrics and free cash flow is finally on an upswing. The wind might finally be at Stericycle's back instead of pushing against it. I wouldn't be surprised to see a huge increase in operating income in the coming year along with further improvement to free cash flow. The company is headed in the right direction and making the right moves for the long term in my opinion. Expect to see $100+ within the next 18 months. Good luck SRCL longs!

"This selling has been so overdone. They are far and away the biggest medical waste hauler in the world. $6B market cap will be $12B market cap within three years. Revenue keeps growing significantly, problems with lawsuits in rearview mirror."
Whoâs been disposing of all the medical waste from COVID-19 testing? Both the point of collection materials (PPE) and from the test labs? Looking at the market I would assume Stericylce. Anyone know if they have contracts with Quest and or Labcorp? Also who do you think is going to dispose of the waste from the 700 million domestic vaccine shots (2x every American).

"There's no arguing SRCL has been a disaster of an investment over the past 5 years, down about 70% from all-time highs. Ouch! With that said, I think the company is making the right moves for a successful future. I expect a leveling off of all the negative trends this year with a flip to positives starting in or 2021. I've owned my shares since the higher $70's, so I'm down substantially. It's a smaller position for me at about 1% my portfolio, so not the end of the world. Regardless, lots of opportunity lost owning this one over he past few years. I'm not one whose typically stubborn refusing to sell losers either, so I must see something I like. Admittedly, I said the same thing in the high-$50's some time back as well. Anyway, can't change the past so trying to focus on where I see this company going. In fact, I may start adding shares for this first time in a few years soon. Good luck to SRCL longs!"

"The March 11 conf call includes some really confusing double talk babble. I think it reads waste volumes will increase in 2020 and pricing will be based on discussions w clients.Jeffrey Marc Silber, BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior Equity Analyst [52]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay. That's helpful. If I could -- and my follow-up, focus on the RWCS business. It was great to see the 2% organic growth. Is it possible to break that out between volume and pricing? And what do you think we should be expecting for those 2 components in 2020?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cindy J. Miller, Stericycle, Inc. - President, CEO & Director [53]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks. I think I'll take first stab, and if Janet has any color that she'd like to add. I think as we take a look from a volume perspective, we are -- anytime you're growing organically, you're increasing your volume. And as we realign our resources, and we really try to expand, if you will, a patch of land of responsibility for a sales resource, we are going to see and we should see some volume increases. But I think what you bring -- the second part of the question from a pricing perspective, that's where the deal review committee, that's where the change in comp incentive plans and the focus that we have on rewarding quality of revenue growth, I think that comes with not always just an assumption that it's a price discussion. As we get more engaged with customers from a collaborative and a partnership perspective, we end up having more discussion about the value that we bring. And I think as we look forward to that, that's where I think we're going to continue to see some steady and strong of what we think are solid growth levels as we look out from a long-range perspective. And again, I couldn't be any more bullish on our commercial group and how well they're doing. And as long as I'm giving a plug, I can tell you, I'm very, very bullish on our ERP opportunities. I think that Janet's leadership team and from a finance perspective, I think we're really doing great things there. Cory is doing a terrific job, just overhauling the commercial group. And I've got to give a shout out to Rich Moore and to Dominic Culotta with engineering and operations. I hope it is -- one of the most exciting things I've talked about was the 27% reduction in headcount in just putting in master operating plans in 14 of the facilities, a reduction in 8% of the fleet. And remember, these weren't our biggest facilities. So for me, just more to come there in terms of all of the things that the foundation of the ERP is going to afford us the opportunity to get that much better.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

"The SA article from a week ago makes an important point that discretionary medical procedures have been curtailed in much of the world but COVID wastes will more than make up for the loss of this med waste stream. I live in a state (Illinois) that just lifted the ban on discretionary surgeries. I believe many states and countries are doing the same. So going forward, I think this discretionary waste stream will return to more normal levels. Some people may view it as the ideal time to have a procedure done since they can rehab at home since traveling is restricted. All this is leading me to consider SRCL an investment rather than a trade on better than expected quarterly numbers.FL"

"I thought the earnings report and the call were OK. It does seem to me that Cindy and Janet do not do a particularly good job of actually answering questions. Nice to see the stock moving up today after not recovering from the earlier selloff as much as many other stocks. Hopefully SOP prices will continue to trend up; I think they are used as an input for tissue paper etc which has of course grown in volume recently. To me, unfortunately, SOP pricing has a huge impact on profitability for the company as a whole; my interest is more on the regulated waste side. Anyways, good luck with this one."
"I think SRCL is in a delicate position. Their free cash flow and paying down of debt suggest a pretty health environment. Yet they took some Cares Act money and do not want to be perceived as benefiting too much from the pandemic. Fortunately the divestitures make the YoY numbers look pretty mundane, no gaudy top and bottom line numbers that make it look like they are profiteering from the tough times. I'm happy with this strategy, rapidly pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet while changing the focus to the core business that has historically been their bread and butter. FL"

"Itronics Reports 2018 Year End Results; Updates Operations Expansion and Diversification ProgressRENO, Nev., April 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Itronics Inc. (OTC:ITRO) a Greentech Fertilizer, Silver, and Mineral Producer, today summarized its operations and diversification progress and announced sales results for the fourth quarter and full year which ended December 31, 2018.Itronics' Total Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $302,598 compared to $419,231 in the same period in 2017. Total Revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,312,848 compared to $1,850,573 in 2017. As previously reported, fertilizer sales were down significantly due to poor weather in the first half of 2018. The outlook for fertilizer sales in 2019 is for a substantial increase, driven by a strong marketing program which was started in the fourth quarter 2018. First quarter 2019 sales were up more than 50 percent compared to the prior yearâs first quarter. The outlook for silver sales is for an increase due to stabilized pilot scale circuit board refining operations, and a contribution from the newly introduced âSilver Nevada Minerâ 5-ounce collector bars. A silver bullion shipment was made in January 2019, and âSilver Nevada Miner"" 5-ounce collector bar sales began in February 2019. The year 2018 was pivotal for Itronics as it continues implementing long term diversification and expansion based upon increasing GOLDân GRO fertilizer sales, expanding its âBreakthrough Technologyâ printed circuit board refining operations, planning staged implementation of operation for other technologies within its portfolio of âZero Waste Technologies,â and establishing a development plan for its Auric Fulstone silver gold zinc copper exploration project in Nevada. Following is a summary of the Companyâs accomplishments in 2018, in order of their importance for the Companyâs diversification and expansion:In May the Company announced that it had entered into an option agreement to purchase a 48-acre manufacturing site at Wabuska, Nevada that includes 60,000 square feet of buildings and a rail siding to be used as an expansion property. The Company plans to initially use this site to expand its GOLDân GRO fertilizer manufacturing operations to be followed later by circuit board refining and other metal recovery operations.In early October the Company announced that it had expanded its GOLDân GRO fertilizer sales team by hiring an experienced sales manager to lead the sales effort and launching an expanded marketing program to introduce the GOLDân GRO fertilizers to a larger customer base.During the year the Company completed important steps in perfecting its pilot scale printed circuit board refining operations. In March the Company announced that it had taken delivery of a commercial scale e-scrap grinder for grinding shredded circuit boards (e-scrap) to feed its refining furnaces. In June the Company announced that using circuit board feed for its refining furnaces that is being ground up by the new e-scrap grinder made it possible to increase the per melt yield by more than 50 percent. The silver content per melt was also increased by 50 percent.In November the Company installed and successfully started up a centrifuge whose purpose is to significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost to perform liquid/solids separations in its hydrometallurgical processing of certain silver-bearing feed materials for the refining operations. The expected benefits are being achieved, making this an important process technology breakthrough for the Company.A confidential Fulstone Project report was updated in early January 2018. The updated report identifies five target areas and recommends a 10-hole investigative drill program consisting of two drill holes for each target area. In October the Company announced the discovery, by surface sampling, of surface 0.4 troy ounce per ton gold at one location and five percent copper at another location at the Fulstone Project. The gold was found within one of the five identified target areas. The copper was found at a location that extends a previously identified mineralized zone by 2000 feet from 5,000-foot strike length to 7,000 feet strike length.>>> For full article pls CLICK HERE >: http://itronics.com/041219.shtmlFollow Itronics on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itronicsincFollow Itronics on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itronicsinc VISIT OUR WEB SITE: http://www.itronics.comContact:Paul Knopick888-795-6336"

"""Court Preliminarily Approves $295 Million Settlement in Stericycle Class Action over Alleged Overbilling Scheme""... While it's terrible SRCL's business practices caused this to happen, the settlement could have been a lot worse. I think this might be win for investors, short term at least. Settlement is still preliminary, but it's progress.SRCL will need to change pricing practices for it's small quantity customers, which is to be expected. That will be the easy part. They have a very long road ahead, mending fences with customers and changing company culture. I think it's doable. I still believe there's upside to the stock price. Selfish wish maybe as I'm down about 10% and would like to see green again someday. I've lost more than 10% on investments before, but I still feel this is one of my 2 worst stock buys ever. I should have known better. Best of luck folks."

"Today's news is a game changer... Company was a mess before, but now I'm not sure where this ends. You can't get them all right when investing and I'll chalk this up to one of my lessons learned.

"The silence regarding the 'federal anti corruption' issue has been deafening. It's been week's since the news broke and I haven't seen any news or company updates on the matter. I continue to hold SRCL (say what you will), with my average price in the higher $70's. I really thought this was going to be a great turnaround story, but the continued stewardship issues with senior management is making that look like nothing but a pleasant dream, while reality is closer to a nightmare. I still believe there's some value here, so sticking it out for the time being. Best of luck folks."

While they think Waste Management is the safest choice I'd point out two things:1) WM is least levered to medical waste; and2) WM has a ton of old landfills that have environmental legacy problems not reflected by the balance sheet. Wait for PFAS regulations to be adopted by more states and see what affect that has on WM share price.
