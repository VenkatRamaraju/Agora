I think what will be interesting today will be the institutions that purchase these shares. This info will be available on fintel within days of the purchase. I just wonder if ARK Funds will be buying with Cathie Woods.
"The Motley Fool recently suggested that with the big drop in MRVI's stock price, it is a good time to sell. The Motley Fool has served as a very reliable Contrarian Indicator for me. When the Motley Fool says to sell, it's a clear Buy signal. I just purchased more MRVI shares at 47 per share. We'll see what happens."

You can just see them letting out the air from this blown up hog

Please someone explain about MRVI's reagents. Are they the lipids that are used in mRNA vaccines? Who are their customers? BNTX and MRNA?

"Institutional Ownership is 107.29 %. for Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.https://fintel.io/so/us/mrvi"
Jefferies just upgraded price target. MRVI on a roll!
Bought at $30.50. This IPO has come at right time when mRNA services are most important in COVID-19 times. This company already has impressive revenue growth. Future is bright. Today on IPO day the volume is already 16 million with an hour of trading left. Has lot of room to run
Reversal… heading back up to all time highs
MRVI reached an all time low at 29.01
pretty good valuation for not having anything yet.
Up! Target 32$
Maravai LifeSciences is up 13.11% to 56.60
#$%$
whats happening today?
Goldman Sachs just upgraded price target!
"Interesting IPO. Looks like no one here!. Wonder why, MRVI is making money and in a very hot area by providing mRNA services amongst others. The COVID-19 successful vaccines BNTX and MRNA are dependent on new technology of mRNA. I BOUGHT Friday @$30.50"
"With the big recent drop in MRVI, most of the shareholder sellers are already out. Meaning much of the selling pressure may be finished, allowing for a new base to form as we head into earnings. If the upcoming earnings numbers are good, I can see this stock having a nice move upward. This stock is by no means dead."
"@mike -- Here are a few price targets I came across, current as of August 12th: Morgan Stanley $62, Robert Baird $59, KeyCorp $58, Zachs $56 and Credit Suisse $54. Most targets (and revenue/earnings estimates) were raised after the company reported those excellent quarterly results. 11 analysts have the stock rated BUY."
pulled out all
Maravai LifeSciences is up 9.20% to 52.11
"This is overvalued compared to SDGR. In fact, SDGR has a larger database and is helping drug companies. I would go with SDGR (whose market cap is half of MRVI)"
Seems likely that this will not hold up at these levels. Probably head down to mid-to-high teens.
Finally some good movement. Hopefully this stock will be visible for other investors too.
MRVI is up 8.52% to 35.29
why is it red again? 14 of september was yesterday
"The Wall Street Facts predicts Maravai will have a price of $61.97 in 12 months! Last quarter they reported an increase of over 300% in revenue! MRVI has 5000 customers and Pfizer and BioNTech are two major vaccine customers of MRVI's.But while the Vaccine market has been a huge boost to MRVI, their Clean Cap Technology is used for multiple drugs, not just for vaccine production.MRVI actually invented the Clean Capping technology and it is their own intellectual property."
This company is getting a lot of positive attention. Popping uo with recommendations from many sourcesas can be easily found when searching.
"I either do not understand this or today's non-short sellers are wrong. As I read the press release on the pricingttoday, it appears that the 20 Million shares will be sold at $50 a share with the closing set for Tuesday. The pricing of shares sold today seems to be of 13.848 Million different shares. People who hear that the big boys are willing to buy for their customers at $50 a share ( in other words are willing to pony up a cool $1 Billion) think that is such bad news that they are willing to let go their own shares for less than $50 a share. That does not make much sense to me. The big boys who got the price set at $50 a share clearly thought that was a good price for their customers. To be able to pick up shares at an even cheaper price today seems like a really good idea."

Stock offering… be prepared for a huge drop tomorrow
Big bearish options activity today; it’ll drop tomorrow morning again
This will be a winner
"I bought at $54 today before the hard dive at the end of the day. We will see $60 soon., nothing wrong with the fundamentals. PPL are waiting to see the offering price, they might miss out the buying opportunity."
Gapped lower at the open and now we're green. Bullish action. Volume looks good too.
"This sells products used in gene therapy, and vaccines including the mRNA vaccines (used in MRNA, BNTX, CVAC). Should be a hot stock. But so far hasn’t shown momentum up,"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"

MRVI reached an all time high at 35.98
Can MRVI break 37 today?Let do it.
MRVI is down almost 50% from highs
"Wow, this is a quiet place.But all’s good."
"it's a ""miracle"" this stock is tanking every day as its name says"
"From the prospectus filed with their IPO, "" As of September 30, 2020, CleanCap had been used by over 100 customers and had been incorporated into several development programs targeting immunization against the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”). These programs included one phase II/III clinical program led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech, three phase I/II clinical programs led by Imperial College London, Fosun Pharma in partnership with BioNTech and CureVac and one pre-clinical program led by the University of Tokyo in partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo.""Summary: The Pfizer/BNTX COVID vaccine uses their CleanCap technology to cap the mRNA, therefore their revenue is intimately tied to the market of the vaccine. Looking like Pfizer and Moderna will be long term vaccine winners so MRVI is pretty much guaranteed revenue in the future."
MRVI is down 7.40% to 29.40
Definitely a winner.
"If I understand this correctly, MRVI got the worst of all possible scenarios here. Usually with secondary offerings, while it adds shares to the float and thus dilutes the shares, they get the financial infusion of all those new shares which creates fresh available new capital for the company. But MRVI clearly stated that they will not receive even one penny from this transaction. Worse yet, there will be 20 million shares added to the float without any benefit of new cash coming in to MRVI, which dilutes the existing shares, similar to a government printing money dilutes the existing currency, causing inflation. This is not a good thing at all, its a bit of a disaster actually for the short term. Long term, if the company continues to show great revenue growth, the stock may recover and even climb. But with all those new shares in the float, now this company needs to attract many more investors for the stock to rise because there are so many more shares out there than there was last week. Yikes."
"yuck, what is going on today? down 9% now"
"Interesting IPO?. Can’t say what’s the right price. Supposed to have impressive revenue growth. Genetic products and services are hot. It’s technology used to stabilize mRNA. What a timing in these days of mRNA VACCINES (BNTX, MRNA)"
No way this company is worth 8billion...
Why is MRVI down so much today??
There’s a product called ez cap from another company making me a little nervous.
What's wrong with MRVI?No buying at all?
What’s the down side considering most IPOs initially give some of their gains?

Key Banc comes in with stock price upgrade today. Not surprised!
Just bought a little more. Seems very strong given the rest of the market.
MRVI is up 7.68% to 29.57
That last hour of -2.5% shows that there's no bid.
"There is no end in sight to furnishing the likes of Moderna, Pfizer and J & J with the reagents in order to produce the vaccine. Revenues and earnings as indicated on the forward guidance positive as far as one can see. This is endless and they are going to make billions."
With the contracts that are signed and ones that are being negotiated this company is putting up nmbers in terms of growth that you would refer to as hyper growth to say the least. Institutional ownership is over 107%. At the current stock price this company won't stay there long as it will be 150.00 easily in the next twelve months.
"Bet this pops up to $40 after earnings. If it doesn't, it's going below $30 lmao. Nowhere in between imo"
aie that hurts
While it looks like it's taking a breather at these levels it's still going to head higher from here. Pfizer just got FDA approval today on vaccine and now it looks like the government wants to do a booster sht. This company according to the earnings transcript is going to continue to see higher volumes of business with regards to the demand in it's reagents for the vaccines.

Baird just upgraded price target.
Out small loss 44.70 might revisit later.
Mike just saw your post on price targets. The secondary by the way was priced at 50.00 a share. The ones I saw were 58.00 and 54.00 a share. They didn't change price targets even after the announcement of the secondary. The fundamentals of the company remain strong. Earnings and revenues are going to continue to rise as the demand for there reagents as they stated in last conference call remain strong as far as they can see going forward. I see this as a temporary event as the stock has a 52 week high of 63.55 and that nothing has changed in that regards.
Is the initial dip from profit taking?
Sold off hard from the reversal

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"

"The investor presentation shows $3.5B SAM. They are already forecasted to be at $500M to $700M run rate for CY2022. Looks like not enough SAM with already dominant position in markets they can sell into. It not a company with large cash on hand...has to sell more, do more R&D, buy more products to expand SAM... so this may go sideways for a while."
