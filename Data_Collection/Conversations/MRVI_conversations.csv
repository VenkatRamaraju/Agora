"The Motley Fool recently suggested that with the big drop in MRVI's stock price, it is a good time to sell. The Motley Fool has served as a very reliable Contrarian Indicator for me. When the Motley Fool says to sell, it's a clear Buy signal. I just purchased more MRVI shares at 47 per share. We'll see what happens."
Please someone explain about MRVI's reagents. Are they the lipids that are used in mRNA vaccines? Who are their customers? BNTX and MRNA?
"It’s the Merck Pill news. It’s irrational that MRVI is selling off because if it, but the market is irrational"
Maravai LifeSciences is up 7.12% to 40.78
why is it red again? 14 of september was yesterday
There’s a product called ez cap from another company making me a little nervous.
"With the big recent drop in MRVI, most of the shareholder sellers are already out. Meaning much of the selling pressure may be finished, allowing for a new base to form as we head into earnings. If the upcoming earnings numbers are good, I can see this stock having a nice move upward. This stock is by no means dead."
bought 300 shares. will be $50s soon.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"The Wall Street Facts predicts Maravai will have a price of $61.97 in 12 months! Last quarter they reported an increase of over 300% in revenue! MRVI has 5000 customers and Pfizer and BioNTech are two major vaccine customers of MRVI's.But while the Vaccine market has been a huge boost to MRVI, their Clean Cap Technology is used for multiple drugs, not just for vaccine production.MRVI actually invented the Clean Capping technology and it is their own intellectual property."
Mike just saw your post on price targets. The secondary by the way was priced at 50.00 a share. The ones I saw were 58.00 and 54.00 a share. They didn't change price targets even after the announcement of the secondary. The fundamentals of the company remain strong. Earnings and revenues are going to continue to rise as the demand for there reagents as they stated in last conference call remain strong as far as they can see going forward. I see this as a temporary event as the stock has a 52 week high of 63.55 and that nothing has changed in that regards.
aie that hurts
earnings date anyone?
"The investor presentation shows $3.5B SAM. They are already forecasted to be at $500M to $700M run rate for CY2022. Looks like not enough SAM with already dominant position in markets they can sell into. It not a company with large cash on hand...has to sell more, do more R&D, buy more products to expand SAM... so this may go sideways for a while."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
Why is MRVI down so much today??
Reversal… heading back up to all time highs
"Fireside Chat, Morgan Stanley Healthcare Conference at 12:30 p.m. PT. Today."
"Part of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings acquired by Thompson Street Capital. Thompson Street Capital acquired Vector Laboratories, the Protein Detection Business Unit of Maravai."
That last hour of -2.5% shows that there's no bid.
