Alex Henderson counters Michael Genovese. Reiterates $15 PT.
"Will INFN see eight again. I don't think it will for a long time.As we are about to hear from our INFN fearless leader on the conference call.The chip shortage will be used as this quarter reason why the company is not moving forward.Whether it meets guidance or not, not nearly as important if they have to shift down in the future guidance.They will promise they have great excitement over the current products, but contracts ? NO.People paying right now NO.And the stock should move comfortably into the six's and possibly lower"
"Samik ChatterjeeAnalyst, JPMorganS Chatterjee flagging what shareholders hope are less severe than projected... or worst case short term concerns, going into Q3 results and conference call.Two Q2 conference call Q&A questions asked:1) Inventory levels and how how their margins are affected by premium parts pricing environmentCEO response: Q2: 1% of additional cost they didn't expect in Q2 on 2% of partsQ3: 1% to 1.5% of additional costQ4: unknown but CFO speculated that it should be getting better (might have to walk back that, given Q3 Actuals)2) bookings vs revenueCEO response:bookings are up across the board but revenue recognition is very timing dependent APAC: revenue recognition flat to down Americas: revenue recognition up EMEA: revenue recognition down"

"fwiw, Infinera blog mentions that they see Customers are mixing their DTN-X long haul switch systems with transponder-only boxes that groom traffic at the edge, to eliminate the need to sort and switch data downstream. Looks like DTN-X will continue to be relevant alongside their GX systems. XR Optics couldn't come fast enough, to catch network owners at a good time to re-architect their aggregation connections. All good, no stale systems. GLTA.infineraDOTcom/blog/face-to-face-meetings-bring-new-optical-networking-vibes/tag/innovation/"
Anyone care to explain why MKM downgrade INFN from PT 11.50$ to 10.50$ which is still a whopping 28% above current price is a problem ? Thanks a lots
Shocked that they announced a 11/3 CC. They seem to be improving. I was expecting 11/10ish.
You be the judge on JP Morgan Initiated JP Morgan: to Neutral 5/3/2018................around $10 plus Downgrade JP Morgan: Neutral to Underweight 6/3/2019.......... right around $3 Upgrade JP Morgan: Underweight to Neutral 11/13/2019.............around $4.90 Downgrade JP Morgan: Neutral to Underweight 10/18/2021............about $7.75
So glad to see most of INFN’s top management successfully hitting their RSU metrics. Too bad shareholders have yet to be invited to the champagne and caviar celebration. I was one of the longstanding bulls on this company who finally got disgusted and bailed out. I know the pain of being a true believer - continuing to hope for future success despite management’s lame performance record and excuses.

"So I didn't think I would be writing this so quickly.But now as we drift into the 6's and that's before earnings call which could easily make it go into the 5's over night. Please remember, INFN does not make any profit, it has never made any profit. It most likely will not make any profit in the future for a long time.Lets not act so surprised when the stock drifts into never never land.Hope and prayers do not make a share price rise"
"Michael Genovese - thought he left MKM Partners and went to WestPark Capital, Inc. Looks like he is back with MKM.Had not been very active on questions during the latest CC but decides to suddenly downgrade Infinera? Must be doing his channel checks and stealth research like in the past!We can't catch a break!"

They strive to rake in all the early adopters of each speed generation."
"Glad I bailed on this six months ago as well as individual stocks and keeping just cash as well as mutual and index funds. Looking back, it's absolutely astounding how much time and energy I wasted through the years looking at stocks like Infinera going up and down, wishing, hoping and praying that ""this time, it will be different."" Life is too short."

"fwiw, another pure tech trial Infinera did back in August with Orange Poland and InPhoTech.

Ciena and Samsung have a PR today about joining forces for 5G. It mentions Ciiena’s X-Haul system. Is this an area where Infinera also has a product offering? Thx
"The possibility that INFN can move in any direction but down after earnings is almost a certainty.When you invest in a stock and you are clinging on to hope for a total surprise, you are not in a good position.Sell this stock before earnings and dont. Let the institutional investors have this one.This will be a five dollar stock before it hits ten again"
"Hope Infinera's network software automation can go toe-to-toe with Ciena's Blue Planet and other offerings. That acquisition years ago seems to be working out well for Ciena.Most of Infinera blog discussion on the subject coming from Teresa Monteiro. It's getting late in the game for networkers to choose platforms, so hopefully she had the chops to orchestrate Infinera's strategy. A tall order given how 3rd party innovation constantly shifts which tools are popular... I read that Infinera's open environment eases plug-ins so I guess their expertise is in making the environment seamless."
"Infinera should be announcing their Q3 quarterly earnings reporting date early next week. - Q3 revenue relative to guidance $340M - $370M- Q4 guidance- visibility on chip shortage -- currently affecting about 2% of the parts they purchase-- represents about 1% to 1.5% hit to margins for Q3, short term-- averaging $15M delivery delay per quarter accumulating (including Q3 effect: $45M - $50M deferred revenue pushed into backlog expected to be delivered in 1H2022)- ICE6 wins------------------------optional topics:- XR Optics progress (XR Forum)as of Q2 XR Forum membership represents ""significant"" share of service provider CapEx spendingas of Q2 conducted 30 XR trials/demos- any additional ICE6 system development statusI keep on waiting for a DTN-X linecard, to capture those easy sales into their significant installed footprint- any additional progress on next generation 1.6T engineno rush there except to match up with Acacia's ac1200sc2 news Cisco keeps on touting"

"09/28/2021 article about upcoming OFC show where all the major optical system and merchant vendors will be displaying latest wares lightwaveonlineDOTcom/optical-tech/article/14203159/four-topics-to-follow-on-the-virtual-ofc-exhibit-floorreplace DOT with .--------------------------------------It's interesting that at the beginning of the article they mention that merchant module vendors will be offering 800G optics and DSP's, to catch up to Ciena (and Infinera). Infinera's Dr Welch awhile ago mentioned that it was critical to co-package the PIC with the DSP, for them to get to 800G with ICE6. It seems these other module vendors either have to be presenting 800G engines in one package too, or selling separate 800G-rated PIC's and DSP's for spread-out, embedded linecard format-only and offering more limited reach because of the PIC-to-DSP larger separation.Besides the Acacia booth, it'll be interesting to see what the other merchant module vendors are touting.See how right the Motley Fool analyst was in throwing in the towel and jumping out the window due to all the purported me-too 800G and beyond module sources.- ADVA (merging with ADTRAN, next year) is an Acacia customer for 1.2T AC1200SC/AC200SC2- Huawei 800G, I thought Mr Fallon mentioned they are using merchant modules............who else."

November 3rd (Wednesday): Q3 report and conference call
"Adtran artle on LR:“Broadband network Adtran reported record demand for its products, but warned that it will post a loss in its most recent quarter due to supply-chain constraints.Broadly, the situation does not come as a surprise. After all, a number of other fiber operators and network suppliers have hinted at similar supply-chain problems. Further, demand for fiber networks has been growing all year, and could shift into overdrive if Congress approves $65 billion in funding for broadband buildouts.Adtran, which referenced some of the issues the company was facing due to supply chain constraints during its second quarter call, said this week it expects to report $138 million in revenue in the third quarter paired along with an operating loss of $10.1 million, below its previous forecasts.""This lower gross margin and decreased profitability, as compared to prior guidance, was attributed to approximately $9 million in quantifiable supply chain constraint-related expenses incurred during the quarter,"" the company reported.“I feel as though Infinera has underestimated the chip / supply issues from the get-go."
"Did we determine who the tier 1 is referenced in last CC? At this year's OIC, optical industry show a major North American Tier 1 service provider highlighted that they have chosen Infinera's open optical portfolio including our 400 gig GX Metro solution for deployments across their network. Additionally, we operationalize another major web-scale customer in quarter four, our 600 gig GX solution for their Metro network. And this customer is actively testing our ICE6 800 gig solution."
"The Telstra PR seems like a good one. I would have saved it for the week before or week of PR, unless they have an even better one forthcoming. Maybe an XR Optics update,not sure that is better unless some big names on board and anecdotal positive comments about more trials and the early results."
"INFN getting walked down once again before earnings period, today on really low total volume for the day in a mixed market and despite guiding revenues moderately up despite nagging chip shortages.

Let's see what Dave Heard has to say on November 3rd. Restoring some credibility by confirming that chip shortage has bottomed would be good.Samik based his downgrade on the persistence of chip shortage. We'll know soon enough who is right.

Open XR Forum site still only shows original six. It would not surprise me if we see several additions all at once prior to the CC. I don’t mean to wind up SharkBait but it would be nice if Infinera can move up their reporting by one week.
"A very good read about XR Optics published by Infinera one month ago. Yes, Infinera put this together but some good info. I found it by going to Google, News, the typing Open XR Forum. It was the 6th choice down the list under the website MarketScreener."
